I<br/>\nsent her back to school for three more days because she wanted to be in the<br/>\nkindergarten concert they had been preparing for for several months.  Then I<br/>\nsimply wrote a polite letter thanking them for their time and effort with my<br/>\ndaughter, but I was taking her out of school.  That was all I had to do for<br/>\nher because kindergarten isn&#39;t mandatory in NH.  When I suddenly had my 8<br/>\nyear old, her step-mother informed them that Cait was coming to live with me<br/>\nand that was that for them.  Cait came from the other side of the state, so<br/>\nthere were no expectations that she would go back there.  I then had 30 days<br/>\nto submit my letter of intent and curriculum to my school district.  I<br/>\nstruggled with my curriculum, but they were wonderful and helped me fashion<br/>\none that reflected my unschooling desire as well as covering the bases as<br/>\nfar as the law was required, which required scope and sequence, tables of<br/>\ncontents, etc.  (It sounds a lot worse than it really was.)  I know that I<br/>\ngot one of the probably very few cooperative school districts.  Once my<br/>\ncurriculum was approved (I wrote it all in the present tense, &quot;we do this,<br/>\nwe do that&quot;), they sent me a letter saying so, and that was what I showed<br/>\nDCYF.  I don&#39;t remember if she asked to see my curriculum or not, but she<br/>\ndid ask me lots of questions about the concept.  I was very honest with her,<br/>\nwhich was much easier since I had just read The Unschooling Handbook by Mary<br/>\nGriffith and I was feeling very confident.  If she asks, give her resources<br/>\nso she can get a better grasp of the idea.  Maybe print off some<br/>\nparticularly relevant web pages to give to her.  I don&#39;t express myself well<br/>\nin person on the spot, so having a list of books and websites to offer was<br/>\nvery helpful.  I also had DH with me and I knew that if I faltered, he could<br/>\nstep in and explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she comes tomorrow, I would say that your child has been ill and you<br/>\nwant to make sure he completely well before going back to school.  If she co<br/>\nmments that he looks quite well already, then just point out that many<br/>\nchildren can be violently ill in the wee hours and have a raging fever, but<br/>\nseem back to normal after a few hours sleep.  I know the local ps won&#39;t take<br/>\nchildren back until they have been fever-free for x number of hours (eg. 12<br/>\nor 24 hours).  Don&#39;t necessarily say that that *was* what happened, but just<br/>\nthat it often does happen.  Then you won&#39;t be lying to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the principal, play up the illness and cancel the appointment.  Your son<br/>\nneeds you at home right now and you can&#39;t go in to this meeting at this<br/>\ntime.  Then take the time to write a letter to the superintendant (your<br/>\nletter of intent, it doesn&#39;t have to be fancy and you don&#39;t have to say why<br/>\nyou are taking him out, only that you will assume responsibility for his<br/>\neducation at this point in time) and send a copy to the principal.  That<br/>\npart (sending a copy) may not be specifically required by law, but I think<br/>\nit is a good idea just so they know they should take him off of their<br/>\nattendance sheets.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cierrajada@...\">cierrajada@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 13, 2005 6:46 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: What do you say? was Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro:<br/>\nconsidering Unsch...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n| Hi Judy<br/>\n|<br/>\n| Thanx for your reply.
