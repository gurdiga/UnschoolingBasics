In his house you didn&#39;t have a piece of bread with out <br/>\nasking.  Not so at my moms house, and she would get irritated(still does) when i would ask <br/>\nfirst.  I ve gotten better, but  when we go anywhere, i bring lunch/dinner and lots of snacks, <br/>\njust in case.  At home our oldest always was a free range type, she ate whatever when she <br/>\nwas hungry.  No issue, then one of our twins has big food issues, she eats until she throws <br/>\nup, not all the time, but if i don&#39;t pay close attention, once a day.  She is 5 and is epileptic, <br/>\nhas developmental issues(so what), and still puts everything in her mouth.  So food has <br/>\nbecome an issue in our house.  Now my kids have to ask, and some times i have to say no, <br/>\nand I hate it.  But i have learned to space her eating, or stall her a bit telling her to let her <br/>\nfood digest a bit, but it is still ME controlling her eating, any suggestions?  BTW we are <br/>\nvegetarians, and the kids usually choose healthy foods, so eating healthy foods isn&#39;t the <br/>\nissue, but G&#39;s overeating.

I have an older kid who  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have much of a sweet tooth, so his choices under a free  <br/>\nsystem never set off my alarm bells. Then along came Carl, now just  <br/>\ntwo, who loves sweets. It&#39;s been a challenge for me to step back,  <br/>\nbreathe deeply, and let him have what he wants--I was saying to my  <br/>\npartner one day that if anything, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more important not to  <br/>\nlimit Carl than not to limit Eric, because with Eric, we could  <br/>\nrestrict candy and he might not even notice, but with Carl--well, he  <br/>\nwould notice, and restricting it would make him think about it more  <br/>\nand more, and next thing we know, he&#39;d be binging. I have  <br/>\nsuccessfully just let Carl have what he wants, and he does stop  <br/>\nbefore he lapses into a sugar coma &lt;g&gt;--he doesn&#39;t even eat as much  <br/>\nsugary stuff as I have sometimes been afraid he would. And, like with  <br/>\nyour son, he has a great diet overall. He&#39;s just been that little bit  <br/>\nmore challenging to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; why do I still knee-jerk<br/>\n&gt; &quot;no&quot; when he asks for a chocolate donut and hasn&#39;t eaten his lunch  <br/>\n&gt; yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe it&#39;s our own brain-training that does this--you have to eat  <br/>\n&quot;real&quot; food first, you have to earn dessert, all that kind of stuff.  <br/>\nI know my mom had a lot of rules about food that seem arbitrary to me  <br/>\nin retrospect, like no pop before 11 a.m. (and you can bet I was  <br/>\nwatching that clock some mornings!).

As I said in a<br/>\npost a moment ago, my views on food consumption are pretty loose.  Not 100%<br/>\nfree yet, this is what I&#39;m working towards.  I&#39;m finding that it is a lot<br/>\neasier to let go of my worries with my 6yo than it is with my 2yo.  Almost<br/>\ncertainly this is because Drew is older and more mature, and is making<br/>\nintelligent food choices on his own.  He likes to eat, but it&#39;s not a huge<br/>\npart of his life.  So his choices don&#39;t usually go against my personal<br/>\nopinions on what a 6yo should eat - makes it a lot easier to let go and<br/>\nallow him to make the choices!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the Universe sent me Josh, who has a love affair with food - much like<br/>\nmommy does.  He loves it, it&#39;s a joy to him.  He thinks about it a lot,<br/>\nloves to cook, loves to shop, loves everything about it.  This is a good<br/>\nthing.  But mommy still has some hangups that I can&#39;t seem to release.  The<br/>\ncurrent situation is candy and sweets.  I don&#39;t care that he eats them.  I<br/>\nget into trouble about &#39;when&#39; and &#39;how much&#39;.  He wakes in the morning and<br/>\nwants gummy worms.  I just can&#39;t seem to say yes to this - I can&#39;t let go of<br/>\nthe need to feed him something healthy before he has them (he does get them<br/>\nin the morning, just not as a first food).  I know this goes against my<br/>\ngoals, so what is my problem?  I&#39;m worried about 1) overall health and 2)<br/>\nhis teeth (which are a major problem and expense - not a justification, just<br/>\na reason for my anxiety).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I look at overall food consumption, i.e. weekly, he eats wonderfully.<br/>\nChicken, fish, rice, noodles, broccoli, carrots, apples, grapes, raisins,<br/>\netc.  All healthy food for a growing kiddo.  So why do I still knee-jerk<br/>\n&quot;no&quot; when he asks for a chocolate donut and hasn&#39;t eaten his lunch yet?  I<br/>\nKNOW he&#39;s going to eat his lunch, or something else later, that is healthy.<br/>\nThe child certainly will not live on chocolate donuts.  And anyway, the<br/>\ndonuts aren&#39;t going to last forever, there are only so many in the package.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I argue with myself during the day.  What&#39;s my real problem here, and<br/>\nhow can I start to look at things differently?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell & Da Boys <br/>\n<br/>\nDrew, 6.5 and Josh, 2.5<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is like riding a bicycle.
