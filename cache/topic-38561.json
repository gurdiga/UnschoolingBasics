Growing up in Germany it was one of my favorite books, not really about unschooling or homeschooling, but about a little girl who never went to school and has a amazing ability to &#39;listen&#39; and just be herself. In come the Grey men who come to steal peoples time and start putting the children in day care away from the parents. When I wanted to find the book in English years ago for my niece in English I had a really hard time finding it, no doubt because it is highly critical of the way society functions now.<br/>\nHighly to be recommended!<br/>\nPippi Longstocking was not homeschooled, she just grows up without parents (a pirate dad at sea who does visit every now and then, and a mama up in heaven) and thinks she does not need school, she learns plenty from life.
