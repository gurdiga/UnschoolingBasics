He said that he didn&#39;t want to be with me and that he wanted to hurt me.

Being overwhelmed doesn&#39;t make for good decisions. And when you have a high-needs kid, putting his needs first can make a big, big difference in the peace of the whole family... but that&#39;s really hard to do with a new baby on hand. I chose not to have a child at one point when Ray was still pretty volatile, in part because of his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can children be ready for a sibling ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d never really thought about it in terms of readiness but kids can definitely be a poor fit for home with a baby in it. That&#39;s something that will change with age, as your son gains more in terms of empathy and a sense of perspective about the world. Hmm, on another list there&#39;s a thread about readiness and being gentle with animals... I think being ready to have a baby in the house is similar to That kind of readiness. If your child isn&#39;t ready, he&#39;ll need a loooooot of support to handle being around the new baby - maybe more support from you than he needs now because he&#39;ll be under a lot of stress. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Do people who choose to have an only do so because they don&#39;t want to hurt their child ?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people only want one child. There are plenty of parents of onlies who only wanted the one. I really only wanted one, myself. In a sense, I had Mo because Ray&#39;s a step-child and not &quot;really&quot; mine - that sounds harsh, maybe, but it&#39;s a fact I had rubbed in my face many times over the years. When Mo was born, Ray&#39;s mom wanted him to come live with her, so I got to have an only again for a few years, and that was nice in some ways even if it was painful in others. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;How can people decide to have another child if they know it will hurt the first one ?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s possible not to realize how much it can hurt. Sometimes it&#39;s not obvious beforehand. It&#39;s Good that you&#39;ve had some really clear, direct feedback from your son on the topic! I was lucky to have really clear messages from Ray that he needed a lot of very focused, individual attention when he was younger and would likely have a hard time &quot;sharing&quot; a parent. But I have No Idea how Morgan would have reacted to the idea of a younger sibling - and had I wanted one, I likely wouldn&#39;t have known until the baby was in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;if I&#39;m waiting for Gilles to be ready we will never have a second child<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a big, Big developmental shift around age 8 when kids who&#39;ve been very needy often become a lot more secure - can you wait that long?

Wait, step back a bit, he&#39;s 3? Children under 3 frequently don&#39;t even play with other kids - your best case is for them to play Alongside other kids without fighting. Between 3 and 4 kids (in general) start to be able to socialize, but even then, many don&#39;t really like to socialize with other children - and even those who do often prefer older kids or younger kids. The absolute hardest social dynamics for kids to navigate occur when you get kids together who are close in age - when there&#39;s a big age gap the dynamics are easier. Ray liked other kids, but had a really hard time playing with them for years. Mo has a few friends close in age, but has only recently started to enjoy playing in groups of kids... and then only if the setting and most of the kids are familiar to her. She&#39;s 10. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool can be really, really hard for kids who aren&#39;t kid-people because they&#39;re stuck in the most stressful environment imaginable with Only kids their own age.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve probably exacerbated the trouble by all your efforts to get your little guy into social situation - not your fault, you&#39;ve been surrounded by the same old assumptions that kids need to socialize with other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, little kids often need a lot of time with parents and some are naturally averse to strangers. That&#39;s a basic, protective instinct on their part. Putting him in daycare - which you probably couldn&#39;t avoid at the time, I get that! - may have set him up to be really anxious and unhappy at the thought of you leaving him for any length of time. That&#39;s something he&#39;ll eventually grow out of without being pushed, but for him to grow out of it (and not... traumatized into numb acceptance) he needs you to support him and be there for him - literally &quot;there&quot; where he is, not trying to get away and do grown-up things without him. If he&#39;s okay being with dad, too, that&#39;s a bonus, but it&#39;s really common for kids to prefer mom to dad until their older. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess explaining them we won&#39;t come (or that my husband comes alone) because Gilles doesn&#39;t want to is not a good idea.

When we talked some weeks ago to spend some days in a child-friendly hotel to relax together, Gilles didn&#39;t want to. We thought it was because he was afraid not to have his foods so we explained we could choose a bungalow formula and bring them. We showed him pictures on the website : he was thrilled by the swimming pool and the indoors playground. But when we mentioned we would also sleep there, he said he didn&#39;t want to sleep out of home.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus there are family gatherings every 2-3 weeks. Belgium is a small country (3 hours to go from one end to another by car) and my husband&#39;s parents and siblings all live within 30 minutes distance. My husband questioned the way he was parented (as I said they were very controlling parents, just to give an example they would turn off the fuses to be sure he wasn&#39;t reading in his room after a given hour) but his siblings didn&#39;t. They seem happy to hang out with their parents and see my husband as the bad guy who isn&#39;t grateful for all his parents did for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are already three events planned for the period mid-May mid-June : a baptism and two birthdays. What we usually do when Gilles doesn&#39;t want to go (8 times out of 10) is telling them we already planned something. But they complain they would like see us more often, that family relationships are important. My husband&#39;s mother told once she would need a lawyer to see his grandson. I know she will never do that because keeping appearances intact is very important for them, but still... it crossed her mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nColienne<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Interactions with other people","postDate":"1336180407","msgId":48476,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5RDMzOTQ1LTdCODMtNDEzMC05Mzg1LTQ4RUI5NkQyMkREOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzYxNzYzNjMuNjA1NTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI4OTAxLm1haWwuaXIyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzYxNzYzNjMuNjA1NTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI4OTAxLm1haWwuaXIyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48475,"nextInTopic":48477,"prevInTime":48475,"nextInTime":48477,"topicId":48475,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I realized it is more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-538108714\">I said in another thread that I was lost regarding the interactions of our son Gilles, who is four years old, with young children. I realized it is more complex than that, I&#39;ll try to explain...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I stopped working to stay<br/>\n with him (he was in daycare from 7 to 16 months, something I highly regret) I was afraid <br/>\nto feel alone and organized a mom-child group every two weeks at our home. But he usually asked to nurse soon after their arrival and we would go in our room for a while. Once he let me know (he wasn&#39;t talking yet) that he wanted to play upstairs with me. I then decided to stop the group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt that time, we sometimes invited people or went to other houses. We couldn&#39;t pay as <br/>\nmuch attention than before to other people because Gilles wanted us to <br/>\nplay/talk with him a lot but it was doable. About one year ago, it <br/>\nbecame much more difficult.Â <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not possible anymore to invite people with young children (I would say under 6 years old) at our house. He was scared when young children came near us in the street/stores, even if he was in our <br/>\narms. Now he is less scared but keep his distances : he will do weird sounds and <br/>\nthreatening looks to intimidate children who come too close. It makes me think about a little gorilla ;-)Â  If we are talking about visiting a family with young children he says he doesn&#39;t want us to go. We know by experience that even if we try to make it easier for him (going to a place he likes on the way or offering to take toys with us) he won&#39;t enter the house once we arrive there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have <br/>\ntried alternatives. Inviting friends in the evenings so they <br/>\nwould come without their children. It wasn&#39;t a good experience : our friends expected a calm meal between adults but we don&#39;t have arbitrary bedtimes and Gilles isn&#39;t exactly a quiet child. Asking my mother to stay with Gilles while we go to other houses. We did it once this year and it went very well, but the last time (we <br/>\nhad planned a restaurant for my husband&#39;s birthday) he began to cry when she arrived. I then suggested to first <br/>\ntake an apÃ©ritif together : he was thrilled and enjoyed it. But he cried again when I told him we would soon have to leave. We then decided to cancel the <br/>\nrestaurant and ordered meals. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe asked him if the would prefer another person than my mom, he answered no. Or if he would prefer to go at their house, he answered no. Or that we could meet friends at a playground or make a walk together, he answered no. Something that always work is my husband or I <br/>\nseeing friends while the other stays at home with Gilles. Maybe there is an alternative we haven&#39;t thought of ? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is events where the three <br/>\nof us are expected to come. There are a lot of gatherings organized by my husband&#39;s family. We don&#39;t go to his parents house oftenÂ  because he doesn&#39;t like to go there (they were very <br/>\ncontrolling parents) but he is willing to go to some of the events organized <br/>\nby his siblings to keep the link. We invented reasons to not go these last months when Gilles didn&#39;t want to but with the summer coming there will be even more things <br/>\norganized. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess explaining them we won&#39;t come (or that my husband comes alone) because Gilles doesn&#39;t want to is not a good idea. They <br/>\nalready all think we over-protect Gilles and it&#39;s our fault if he is more <br/>\ninterested to play with us than with his cousins, or doesn&#39;t agree to sit on a sofa near them for a family picture, or doesn&#39;t eat anything at their house, or doesn&#39;t like to be kissed on the cheeks, or whatever doesn&#39;t meet their expectations. They think all would be better if he was in school like all the children they know. It&#39;s easier with my family : Gilles likes to visit my parents, my brother doesn&#39;t have <br/>\nchildren and my sister&#39;s family currently live abroad !<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a complete picture, I will add that Gilles talks all day long, to ask questions or to tell stories. He has a lot of imagination. He is curious about a ton of things. He smiles and laughs a lot. When we are out, he observes a lot. He needs time to warm up in places he doesn&#39;t know. If a <br/>\ngrown-up stranger asks him a question he will answer &quot;Nothing !&quot; if he doesn&#39;t have a good feeling but will begin to <br/>\nchat if he has. He races the joggers in the street... and will hold my hand while running ! And when our new little neighbor, who is six, comes near the yard&#39;s wall, Gilles talks with him. I guess it is because he knows the wall will prevent the <br/>\nneighbor to come too close.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your reading,<br/>\nColienne<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48495,"nextTopicId":48504}}
