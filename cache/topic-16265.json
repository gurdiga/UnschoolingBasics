I have mentioned<br/>\nbefore about my struggle with food addiction... now that I&#39;ve let up on all<br/>\nfood limitations (for myself also), I not only have stopped overeating but<br/>\nno longer crave the foods that once controlled me.  McDonald&#39;s makes me sick<br/>\nto think about, I may have chocolate every now and then... because it is now<br/>\na non-issue... it&#39;s no longer controls my thoughts and actions.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI do know from listening to my body that I don&#39;t make the wisest choices<br/>\nwhen I&#39;m tired, so I am extra careful after work not to overdo it on the<br/>\nfood...\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nbut I just want to get my voice out there on this issue because freedom is<br/>\nreally the best thing  :)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16263,"nextTopicId":16266}}
