I am <br/>\ngrateful to have had this learning experience really young.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was 18 years old and sharing a house with 3 other young women <br/>\naround my age.  I had borrowed one of my housemates gloves and I <br/>\nhadn&#39;t returned them yet.  I guess I was feeling kinda funky about <br/>\nthat.  I was the first one home this one particular day, and I went <br/>\ninto my room and found on my dresser a note from this one housemate, <br/>\nEva, from whom I had borrowed the gloves.  I read her hand-written <br/>\nnote to me, and I was incredulous at the hostility and venom in that <br/>\nnote!  I was really freaked out and started feeling pretty defensive <br/>\nand crummy about the whole thing.  I read it a couple of more times <br/>\nand then, really upset, I put the note down on my dresser and went <br/>\ninto the kitchen to get something to drink.  When I came back, I <br/>\npicked up the note to re-read it and was amazed to find that the note <br/>\nwas completely NOT at all about the gloves and was not hostile or <br/>\nvenomous in any way.  There was, in fact, no way I could read that <br/>\nnote and trick myself into seeing this other stuff I thought had been <br/>\nthere.  It was so weird!  She was just telling me that she would be <br/>\nhome later than expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was sooo weird that I could actually have *seen* something so <br/>\nplainly that simply wasn&#39;t there.  That&#39;s when I learned not to <br/>\nnecessarily believe everything I think I&#39;m seeing or hearing, or <br/>\nespecially what I&#39;m even thinking.  What an incredible, beautiful <br/>\nlesson that was!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji, who still has those gloves<br/>\n<br/>\n(nah!  just kidding!  I can&#39;t keep gloves for a week, let alone 32 <br/>\nyears!  YIKES!  Did I just say 32 years?!?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/\">http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/</a>&gt;Joyfully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/\">http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;Our Unschooling Life (a &#39;blog)<br/>\nLive Fully ~ Live JoyFully!<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Dealing with tone was: The Empty Cup Mind","postDate":"1203364241","msgId":29980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxNTcwMWM4NzI2NyQ4YjEwMDUyMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":29976,"nextInTopic":29990,"prevInTime":29979,"nextInTime":29981,"topicId":29975,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Read the posts and read them as you being the parent being attacked. *** I think this part of the problem.

It has never, over the years, been just you. There are many people (if I recall correctly, including me when I first started exploring unschooling before this list even existed) who have complained about the tone of some unschooling posters.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the more senior unschoolers have a richly-deserved reputation for speaking their minds in an extremely direct, even strident, way. And now I see some new (to me anyway) folks taking that same tack.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if the readers you are hearing from could learn not to take each word from those posters so personally, to reach for the overarching messages and themes, to see what fits them now and what they would like to grow into (or not), they will get a lot of benefit from reading here and on other unschooling lists/boards/sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they must be responsible for their own reactions to what they read. If they find certain posters to be too upsetting, they shouldn&#39;t read their posts. Really. I&#39;ve done it and it works. Certain posters just rub me the wrong way (although I am certain I never ruffle anyone else&#39;s feathers :) ) and I can&#39;t stand their online &quot;voices.&quot; I don&#39;t read what they write.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, in the long run, I end up getting the same information and the same insights from others along the way. So much is repeated and rephrased and reanalyzed that you really can&#39;t miss the main points. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo where was I? Oh yes. Speak up. Take what you can from the answers you get. Leave the rest. Don&#39;t fight endlessly with people you are never going to agree with. If unschooling turns out not to be for you, oh well. Move on. If it mostly fits but you keep comparing yourself to other unschoolers, get over it. We all do things differently. <br/>\n<br/>\nStep back and soak in the big picture. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, enough from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the posts and read them as you being the parent<br/>\nbeing attacked.
