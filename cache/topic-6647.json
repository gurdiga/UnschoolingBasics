(I&#39;m tired tonight and my brain <br/>\nis not at it&#39;s best!).  Wow, they sound a lot alike!   She&#39;s not <br/>\ncurrently on neopets, she started there, then moved to Disney toontown, <br/>\nthen found Runescape, and is almost exclusively on World of Warcraft <br/>\nnow (WOW) (software you purchase then also purchase a monthly online <br/>\nmembership, interactive).  I&#39;ll give her your dd&#39;s neopets info (I know <br/>\nshe has a user name but just hasn&#39;t been on it in a while), actually <br/>\njust told her, she said she&#39;d check it out tomorrow, as she hasn&#39;t been <br/>\non in a while and would like to check in (I&#39;ll let you know what her <br/>\nuser name is).  Actually, we stopped toontown when she became intersted <br/>\nin WOW, but just today (it&#39;s her 13th bday!) she reconnected with <br/>\nsomeone she met on toontown via email and is thinking of rejoining <br/>\nbecause there are some additions etc she wants to check out (has your <br/>\ndd ever checked out toontown?).<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to email me offline too.  BTW, where are you located?<br/>\nJann (in MA)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187272528,"authorName":"gutchmom1@aol.com","from":"gutchmom1@...","profile":"lschlei2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] sleeping in late","postDate":"1127186394","msgId":6648,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzhCQTk0RTVBQzZBQS0xNzEwLTM1RDVAbWJsay1yMzMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRnbnM1dSsyYW9wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRnbnM1dSsyYW9wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6647,"nextInTopic":6649,"prevInTime":6647,"nextInTime":6649,"topicId":6647,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, my name is Lyn and I have a daughter Emily.
