I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re in Washington state (since there&#39;s<br/>\nSeattle in your screen name). One thing to note is that even though a<br/>\nstandardized test is the basic option, the results are RETAINED by you,<br/>\nnot submitted to anyone unless requested (which is rare I think). And,<br/>\nthat is not the only option - if you can find (through local<br/>\nhomeschoolers) a homeschooling/unschooling friendly person who is<br/>\ncertified to teach in WA to do a personal evaluation, that is acceptable<br/>\ntoo. What many people do when tests are required is to check out what<br/>\ntheir test options are (some places limit you to a short list of<br/>\nacceptable tests, others don&#39;t) and take the least intrusive one. For<br/>\ninstance, I think the PASS test is one that allows you to do the test at<br/>\nhome yourselves (you &#39;administer&#39; it to the kids). Then you tuck the<br/>\nresults in a drawer without opening the envelope. You maybe give each<br/>\nchild a die so they can choose a random answer for ones they aren&#39;t sure<br/>\nof - tossing a die makes it obvious that it has nothing to do with what<br/>\nthey do or don&#39;t know.

We started letting go of controls about 6 months ago, but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t let go of everything all at once. First of all, it&#39;s hard to <br/>\nsuddenly let go completely. Second, it can be overwhelming for the <br/>\nkids and a less than completely on-board dh. Letting go of controls <br/>\ngradually can be a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI let go of asking for help cleaning up and it took a few months <br/>\nbefore ds (4 y o) started to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just let go of bedtime recently. There were practical problems and <br/>\nmost of the time ds didn&#39;t mind going to bed. A couple weeks ago, it <br/>\nstarted to get upset about it, so now he goes to sleep on the couch <br/>\nwith me. He goes to sleep about an hour later than he used to, but <br/>\nsleeps a little later, too. I really like having him snuggled next to <br/>\nme while I watch a little tv at night. He falls asleep at almost the <br/>\nexact same time every night and he&#39;s started to recognize when he&#39;s <br/>\ngetting sleepy. That&#39;s important to me because I&#39;m pregnant and it&#39;s <br/>\ngetting harder to carry him up the stairs. I&#39;ll need him to go to <br/>\nsleep in his bed in another couple months. We&#39;ll probably move the tv <br/>\nin the kitchen to his room and buy a cheap dvd player so I can have <br/>\nboth kids upstairs to go to sleep without them making noise and <br/>\nwaking dh up--he goes to sleep earlier than both kids. Anyway, it <br/>\ntook a while for me to stop clenching and worrying and actually open <br/>\nup my mind to look for ways to make it work out. I *can* carry Mikey <br/>\nupstairs now, so it&#39;s okay for him to stay downstairs now. <br/>\n<br/>\nFood is still an issue. We were in a really bad place with his eating-<br/>\n-or not eating. He wouldn&#39;t eat just because we were asking. He <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t try anything new. And so on. We haven&#39;t let go of controls <br/>\ncompletely and so we&#39;re still having some battles. Both kids ate huge <br/>\namounts of candy for the month around Halloween and it bugged me. <br/>\nLooking back now, I can see that sighing and saying &quot;alright&quot; when <br/>\nthey asked for candy is not the same as leaving the candy bowl where <br/>\nthey could reach it. Maybe today I&#39;ll finally get around to <br/>\nreorganizing some shelves and put more food where they can reach it. <br/>\nThat really is different than saying yes to requests...They do eat <br/>\nlots of fruit and I&#39;ve learned that putting it out in the morning <br/>\nleads to fewer candy requests in the afternoon! They have their dad&#39;s <br/>\nsweet tooth, which is quite different than my tastes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just wanted to babble about our experiences in the last 6 <br/>\nmonths. How fast your children change depends on where you and they <br/>\nare now, how much you really change--it can be hard to stop asking <br/>\nfor help cleaning up without getting annoyed--right away and how much <br/>\nyour dh is still saying things like &quot;you need to clean up this mess <br/>\nright now&quot; and &quot;no pie until you eat your dinner&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

He falls asleep at almost the <br/>\n&gt; exact same time every night and he&#39;s started to recognize when he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; getting sleepy. That&#39;s important to me because I&#39;m pregnant and it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; getting harder to carry him up the stairs. I&#39;ll need him to go to <br/>\n&gt; sleep in his bed in another couple months. We&#39;ll probably move the tv <br/>\n&gt; in the kitchen to his room and buy a cheap dvd player so I can have <br/>\n&gt; both kids upstairs to go to sleep without them making noise and <br/>\n&gt; waking dh up--he goes to sleep earlier than both kids. Anyway, it <br/>\n&gt; took a while for me to stop clenching and worrying and actually open <br/>\n&gt; up my mind to look for ways to make it work out. I *can* carry Mikey <br/>\n&gt; upstairs now, so it&#39;s okay for him to stay downstairs now. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Food is still an issue. We were in a really bad place with his eating-<br/>\n&gt; -or not eating. He wouldn&#39;t eat just because we were asking. He <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t try anything new. And so on. We haven&#39;t let go of controls <br/>\n&gt; completely and so we&#39;re still having some battles. Both kids ate huge <br/>\n&gt; amounts of candy for the month around Halloween and it bugged me. <br/>\n&gt; Looking back now, I can see that sighing and saying &quot;alright&quot; when <br/>\n&gt; they asked for candy is not the same as leaving the candy bowl where <br/>\n&gt; they could reach it. Maybe today I&#39;ll finally get around to <br/>\n&gt; reorganizing some shelves and put more food where they can reach it. <br/>\n&gt; That really is different than saying yes to requests...They do eat <br/>\n&gt; lots of fruit and I&#39;ve learned that putting it out in the morning <br/>\n&gt; leads to fewer candy requests in the afternoon! They have their dad&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; sweet tooth, which is quite different than my tastes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, just wanted to babble about our experiences in the last 6 <br/>\n&gt; months.

We started letting go of controls about 6 months ago, but <br/>\ndidn&#39;t let go of everything all at once. First of all, it&#39;s hard to <br/>\nsuddenly let go completely. Second, it can be overwhelming for the <br/>\nkids and a less than completely on-board dh. Letting go of controls <br/>\ngradually can be a good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI let go of asking for help cleaning up and it took a few months <br/>\nbefore ds (4 y o) started to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just let go of bedtime recently.

There isn&#39;t a certain amount of time that will work for everyone.<br/>\nThe less you have to undo, the less time it&#39;ll take for your children to<br/>\nlearn with joy and help out around the house with joy.  The more you model<br/>\ndoing things out of love for them and with joy, the sooner they&#39;ll do the<br/>\nsame for you.  Your kids are pretty young though.  Instead of dropping it in<br/>\nyour dh&#39;s lap, you could start by giving him some small articles to read,<br/>\none at a time, and at the same time, start saying yes to your kids more and<br/>\nfinding ways to work things out in a non-coercive manner.   And model<br/>\nhelping others with joy.  It&#39;s really all about the joy.   As far as<br/>\neducation goes, it often helps newer unschoolers to log the learning that<br/>\ngoes on day to day and share it with your dh.  (I would do this without the<br/>\nkids knowing, so they don&#39;t think more value is placed on educational<br/>\nthings.) <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175059986,"authorName":"Amanda Soman","from":"&quot;Amanda Soman&quot; &lt;amandasoman@...&gt;","profile":"amandasoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"hi","postDate":"1101494534","msgId":4144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNvN3RlNit1ZWh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4145,"prevInTime":4143,"nextInTime":4145,"topicId":4144,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m new to the unschooling ideas.
