At least the best they think they can do at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s when they think that they can&#39;t do/be better---that &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough---that&#39;s what blows my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can someone be a &quot;good enough&quot; parent? Why would that be a goal?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI *know* *I* can be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that I do &quot;well enough&quot;---and I&#39;m OK with them. Auto repair. I&#39;m willing to pay someone for that! &lt;g&gt; I really don&#39;t want to be more knowledgeable about my minivan. It&#39;s OK. Really. Golf. It&#39;s OK. Really! Plumbing. Mountain climbing. I don&#39;t feel that I need to be better at any of those things. Really. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI *like* being a better gardener, a better dog show judge, a better cook. Because I want to be better at these things, I work at them. If I didn&#39;t care about getting better, I&#39;d be happy with &quot;good enough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a parent and a spouse are, *I* think, the two most important roles I&#39;ll have. I can never be &quot;good enough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard for me to understand how a mother can be happy being a &quot;good enough&quot; mother. But, ya&#39; know, for some women, it&#39;s OK. Really. And I can&#39;t change that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I can choose not to let their lack of interest in being better moms affect *me* or my parenting. I can choose to avoid them (which is my usual MO). If I&#39;m around them, <br/>\nI can be a shining example with my own boys---and then leave asap. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest situation for me is when I&#39;m friends with the other mom. If you&#39;re anonymous (like here), I&#39;m comfortable giving advice/direction/opinion. If I know you personally, I struggle horribly. I bite my tongue until I eventually explode. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAre *YOU* comfortable with your choice to be a better parent? You don&#39;t have to &quot;go with the crowd.&quot; You *can* stand up for your principles without interfering with their lack of principles. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s important to ask *why*. A lot. It gets easier the more you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parenting doesn&#39;t get attacked any more; but when it did, I learned to turn it around on them: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We choose not to punish the boys. It doesn&#39;t work, and our relationship with our children is more important to us. Talking with them and modeling seems to work better for us. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m not going to punish *my* child so that you feel better about punishing yours. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If I thought you were right, I&#39;d probably do the same thing. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah? Proof is in the pudding, and I&#39;m a patient cook. Let me know how your relationship with your teen is. Please pass the bean dip.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the best way to &quot;suggest alternative parenting ideas&quot; is to &quot;Just Do IT! BE the example. Because your children are very young, you&#39;ll probably be laughed at behind your back <br/>\n(and to your face) for years. But when you have gentle, kind, interesting *teens* who love to be around you and are honest and generous, you can just sit back and smile when they start whining about how difficult and impossible their teens are. &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe view is nice up here. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Rebecca De Hate &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebeccadehate@...\">rebeccadehate@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello unschoolers out there. I haven&#39;t posted lately or often but I<br/>\nlike to pop on and read postings.  I have some thoughts on my mind and<br/>\nI feel that this group could help me.  First , I&#39;m mommy to to boys 6<br/>\nyear old Ian and 21/2 year old garret. I have been implementing<br/>\nunschooling for at least 3 years now when my friend directed me to<br/>\nthis exact group for help with &quot;disciplining&quot; my oldest .  Wow was my<br/>\neyes opened. I stayed up lately reading post having major ah-hah<br/>\nmoments and fully understanding that why and how unschooling could<br/>\nwork.. I have slowly let go of some old baggage and implementing<br/>\nsaying yes more and my relationship with my children has change<br/>\ntremendoulsy.  And usually when there is issues -- deep down there<br/>\nmine... So here&#39;s my thoughts..<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I &quot;hold&quot; my own when there others around that implement what I<br/>\nconsider old parenting styles?  I would like to think that I am a<br/>\nstrong enough person to not be swayed but I find myself being a little<br/>\nstricter when others are around if I don&#39;t watch myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find myself just feeling=2<br/>\n0more stressed.  Not at my kids but the<br/>\nother parents.  Sometimes they will make comments , not really<br/>\ndirectly &#39;attacking&#39; my style of parenting but I can sometimes feel<br/>\nit.. or is that just me?? and my insecurities??<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found myself just irritated as shit when parents scold there<br/>\nkids over things I really don&#39;t know why they are getting after them.<br/>\n For example, a friend and I are walking around our neighborhood and<br/>\nour two boys are at the end of some ones driveway (to wait for us and<br/>\nstay out of cars way) and they are just throwing stones up in the air.<br/>\n No biggy in my eyes.  they are not throwing them at anyone , but my<br/>\nfriend says don&#39;t so then I do. in my thoughts just out of respect but<br/>\nthen part of me is why???:? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the other day a new friend is over with her 31/2 and 11/2 year<br/>\nold boys and her solution to her boys whining/crying/not sharing is to<br/>\nput in the corner (now I think she arrived at this conclusion because<br/>\nher friend implements this technique and she feels that her friends<br/>\nkids are great their 6, 4 and 15 months =-== well i just met her kids<br/>\nyesterday and they just plan seem unhappy. they barely talk (not shy<br/>\nbecause the girl kept coming to me and climbing up on my lap and<br/>\ngravitating toward me all night), they are not at all &#39;rowdy&#39; which I<br/>\nguess maybe my boys are just overly...  and I just sense a feeling of<br/>\nsadness in them.  The mom even joked about that maybe she&#39;s just more<br/>\nstrict because when we  were<br/>\n talking about timing out and only going<br/>\nby the minutes by the age of the child -- and she said she just makes<br/>\nthem stand there until she feels like letting them out of the time<br/>\nout???)   Soooo am I just being overly judgemental... by all means I<br/>\nam not a perfect parent , I&#39;m still controlling at  times, and yell<br/>\nand have even hit my children (lots better though about controlling<br/>\nthat issue...) <br/>\n<br/>\nokay and since I&#39;m on a roll , let me vent about the time my cousin<br/>\nwas down here and right away -- I recieved comments about that there<br/>\nshould be routines and bedtimes and controls etc --- which truthfully<br/>\nshe may have all that implemented but I think some of the shit was a<br/>\nfront... basically on me about control and then one time I did over<br/>\nexert myself with my boy -- she attacked that -- I shouldn&#39;t have done<br/>\nthat and if cps had seen that I would be in trouble.......and that I<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t yell so much... Granted I shouldn&#39;t and since then even<br/>\nthough she pissed me off I haven&#39;t --- however I do know when i&#39;m<br/>\nstressed I&#39;m harder on the boys (not an excuse just acknowledging and<br/>\nwilling to change).....However, I couldn&#39;t see where her harsh<br/>\ncontrols were great -- yep she had a trained daughter but..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I guess my ramblings are that I want to be accepted for my<br/>\nchoices as a parent and I want to except others also...Should I gently<br/>\nsuggested alternative ways to discipling? or just keep my mouth<br/>\nshut???  I like advocating a more positive, peaceful way of parenting<br/>\n<br/>\nhowever not everyone gets it?  So many just argue that we need to<br/>\ncontrol this or that etc??? so I usually just shut up?  Figure if I<br/>\njust show them by actions maybe they will get it... when I have seen a<br/>\nbetter way of handling a situation I see it and try it soo????<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway if I am making any sense at all please respond.

She likes drama sometimes.  While that sounds bad, I<br/>\nhave to remember that for 9 years, I didn&#39;t always listen to her needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis week my sister critizied me, I told her to go pound sound.  My daughter<br/>\nwas bullied in various forms for 6 months of school in 2nd grade and on two<br/>\noccasions by the teacher in 3rd grade which was last year and I pulled her<br/>\nout.  We have quad&#39;s next door 3 of which are girls.  They are my daughter&#39;s<br/>\nbest friends.  For years she has been afraid to say boo to Ciara because she<br/>\nstumps off and won&#39;t play with her.  My daughter told me at 9pm Weds. night<br/>\nthat she and Ciara had a fight and she didn&#39;t back down and they had started<br/>\nshoving.  I asked her who shoved first, she said she didn&#39;t know.  I told<br/>\nher Faith, in our family we have a principle that honesty with each other is<br/>\nwhat is most important.  She asked me was I going to be mad and I told her<br/>\nno.  She said I pushed Ciara first.  I said that&#39;s fine, I just wanted to<br/>\nremember we don&#39;t use hands to solve our differences.  She said okay.<br/>\n <br/>\nI personally wanted to shout at the roof&#39;s that my daughter stood up for<br/>\nherself, which she has been doing verbally for a bit after discussing many<br/>\ntimes how to handleCiara&#39;s fit&#39;s.  I called my sister and said to her, look<br/>\nhere was your fear about homeschooling and that we have made tremdous<br/>\nprogress.  My sister or Negative Nancy went into a whole thing about Faith<br/>\nusing her hands.  I told her to get off of it.  That she is handling herself<br/>\nbetter, that the kid&#39;s mother and several other people have told me she<br/>\nisn&#39;t afraid of her shadow anymore or to speak her mind.  That she can&#39;t<br/>\nhave it both ways.  Of course I told Faith that she shouldn&#39;t use her hands<br/>\nunless someone does that to her.   The boy quad has hit her and she didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink she was allowed to hit him back.  His mother and I both told her he<br/>\nlooks at her on the same level as his sister&#39;s and that if he hits her,<br/>\nwhack the crap out of him.  She said she is afraid to and his sister&#39;s said<br/>\ndon&#39;t be we will have your back.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe quad&#39;s are raised by two working parents, who have sitters in every<br/>\nafternoon and my daughter has been raised with them since they were babies.<br/>\nWe walked the together and they played together from the earliest points in<br/>\ntheir life.  They have undergone a huge upheaval since their mother had to<br/>\ngo to work and they are acting out more.  I&#39;m not going to stop Faith from<br/>\nplaying with them. I do point out the differences in how we live our lives.<br/>\nFaith doesn&#39;t get hit or smacked.  She had even prior to our change of<br/>\nlifestyle maybe 5 time out&#39;s.  All I would say to her is I know you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe acting this way if you weren&#39;t tired so go take a rest.  She would freak<br/>\nout.  I don&#39;t say that anymore.  I call her over and ask if she wants to<br/>\nsnuggle with me.<br/>\n <br/>\nFaith and I have discussed another of the treatment of another child she<br/>\nplays with by her mother and father and after the last joint outing.  Faith<br/>\nmade the decision she can&#39;t watch it anymore that it is to sad how angry and<br/>\nbitter the mother is.  How she takes it out on her child and that she has<br/>\ndone the same to Faith.  Faith doesn&#39;t feel comfortable being around them so<br/>\nwe had to end the friendship.  This is something Faith did on her own.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":208961162,"authorName":"Kim Zerbe","from":"&quot;Kim Zerbe&quot; &lt;kim.zerbe@...&gt;","profile":"zerbe2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Just some thoughts that I could use some assistance with.","postDate":"1223663764","msgId":36520,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3ZmYwMWM5MmIwNyQwZTM2ZDYxMCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzNTA2My45ODcyLnFtQHdlYjU2MTA2Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDEwMDcxMm83ODUwM2Y5ZWgxZDE5MThjMjljZGIzZGJhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MjM1MDYzLjk4NzIucW1Ad2ViNTYxMDYubWFpbC5yZTMueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36515,"nextInTopic":36528,"prevInTime":36519,"nextInTime":36521,"topicId":36469,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know the comments from other parents are hard to take!

Well he started to cry and mumble something about<br/>\nhow he was SOOOO hungry he had to have it right away, but it was sort of<br/>\nnonsensical gibberish (only a mother can understand) as he fell onto the<br/>\nfloor and rolled around. I&#39;m sure we had been there too long and he&#39;d been<br/>\nplaying so hard, he just needed a break, so I picked him up and tried to<br/>\ncalm him down in my lap.

I feel like it&#39;s my job to know when he&#39;s had enough and needs<br/>\na break, and he was right to come to me! I was selfishly wanting to finish<br/>\nsomething first, and when I realized that, it was easy to comfort him and<br/>\nwait for him to be calm. Then we got the money out and he got to make the<br/>\npurchase (he&#39;s 4, it&#39;s a big deal). Now I could go on about how I don&#39;t like<br/>\nto always buy the $1.50 scoop of sorbet because it&#39;s sort of a waste of<br/>\nmoney, but how do you explain that to a 4 yr old? So sometimes we get one! I<br/>\nalready feel bad that he is allergic to dairy and can&#39;t eat pizza there! We<br/>\nhave to eat at Wendy&#39;s before we go, although yesterday I ate pizza there,<br/>\nso he saw that I had food, so it seemed not the right time to say no to the<br/>\nsorbet. ;)<br/>\n <br/>\nOh I&#39;m sure this is way off topic! I guess I just needed to vent. I started<br/>\na thread a while back about this friend in particular and movie choices am<br/>\nstill processing how I want to deal with her and her surly comments.<br/>\n <br/>\nI did like Schuyler&#39;s comments and will be thinking more about how I want to<br/>\ndeal with children, regardless of what their parents think!!! THAT is<br/>\nsetting a good example.<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Z<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of rebecca de<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 10, 2008 7:32 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Just some thoughts that I could use<br/>\nsome assistance with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nK,  <br/>\n<br/>\n OH my ! that is impactful! and really true.

The potential cost for my social faux pas<br/>\n<br/>\nwas to Linnaea and to Simon and not to me. Because of that I&#39;ve worked<br/>\n<br/>\nreally hard to change my perspective and thus my approach. One is to<br/>\n<br/>\nrecognize that I&#39;m not all that concerned about the parenting, more about<br/>\n<br/>\nthe child. That means I can be generous to the child without worrying about<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat their parent is doing, or at least not so much. It may not seem to make<br/>\n<br/>\na lot of difference, but it kind of cuts them out of the picture. It allows<br/>\n<br/>\nme to worry less about the parenting and just be the adult I want to be when<br/>\n<br/>\ninteracting with the child or children. The other thing that helps is to<br/>\n<br/>\nrecognize how lucky I am that I get to do this life. I know that it&#39;s not<br/>\n<br/>\njust luck, it&#39;s a lot of work and thought and reading and breathing and<br/>\n<br/>\npatience and curiousity and exploration. But I have a life where I can be<br/>\n<br/>\nhome<br/>\n<br/>\nor out and about with Simon and Linnaea in ways that so many other people I<br/>\n<br/>\nknow just don&#39;t seem to be able to manage.

One is to<br/>\nrecognize that I&#39;m not all that concerned about the parenting, more about<br/>\nthe child. That means I can be generous to the child without worrying about<br/>\nwhat their parent is doing, or at least not so much. It may not seem to make<br/>\na lot of difference, but it kind of cuts them out of the picture. It allows<br/>\nme to worry less about the parenting and just be the adult I want to be when<br/>\ninteracting with the child or children. The other thing that helps is to<br/>\nrecognize how lucky I am that I get to do this life. I know that it&#39;s not<br/>\njust luck, it&#39;s a lot of work and thought and reading and breathing and<br/>\npatience and curiousity and exploration. But I have a life where I can be<br/>\nhome<br/>\nor out and about with Simon and Linnaea in ways that so many other people I<br/>\nknow just don&#39;t seem to be able to manage. And while I am sure if this life<br/>\nwas something they really wanted they could achieve it, it is still because<br/>\nof all the wonderful gifts in my life that I am able to do this. It helps a<br/>\nlot to see my life as this wonderful joyous trip that I&#39;m on. Sometimes I<br/>\nscrew up, some moments I suck and grouch and say the wrong thing at the<br/>\nwrong time. Who am I to throw stones at glass houses? I get to live with my<br/>\nchoices and so do other parents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I try and limit my expression of opinion to appropriate forums. Here is<br/>\ngreat. Here I&#39;m asked what I think and for help and advice. In other<br/>\npeople&#39;s homes and lives and company I don&#39;t have to be on call as an<br/>\nadvisor. And when I&#39;m asked for advice, I need to take it with a grain of<br/>\nsalt, and be prepared not to have anything that I say be taken more as a<br/>\nmomentary conversation.&quot;    ---Schuyler<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com/\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/9/08, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HoneyBeeECPlus3@...\">HoneyBeeECPlus3@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HoneyBeeECPlus3@...\">HoneyBeeECPlus3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; i don&#39;t know, but before i was trying to unschool, i was simply an<br/>\nattached parent, or trying to be.? i have a very low tolerance level for<br/>\nother parenting styles.? even though i make my share of mistakes, etc.?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  From: jenniferbreseman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jen@...\">jen@...</a> &lt;lt%<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:3Bjen@...\">3Bjen@...</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Thu, 9 Oct 2008 2:56 pm<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Just some thoughts that I could use some<br/>\nassistance with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I wonder if this is a universal, or at least very common unschooling<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  experience.

I have slowly let go of some old baggage and implementing<br/>\nsaying yes more and my relationship with my children has change<br/>\ntremendoulsy.

Sometimes they will make comments , not really<br/>\ndirectly &#39;attacking&#39; my style of parenting but I can sometimes feel<br/>\nit.. or is that just me?? and my insecurities??<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found myself just irritated as shit when parents scold there<br/>\nkids over things I really don&#39;t know why they are getting after them.<br/>\n For example, a friend and I are walking around our neighborhood and<br/>\nour two boys are at the end of some ones driveway (to wait for us and<br/>\nstay out of cars way) and they are just throwing stones up in the air.<br/>\n No biggy in my eyes.  they are not throwing them at anyone , but my<br/>\nfriend says don&#39;t so then I do. in my thoughts just out of respect but<br/>\nthen part of me is why???:? <br/>\n<br/>\nOh and the other day a new friend is over with her 31/2 and 11/2 year<br/>\nold boys and her solution to her boys whining/crying/not sharing is to<br/>\nput in the corner (now I think she arrived at this conclusion because<br/>\nher friend implements this technique and she feels that her friends<br/>\nkids are great their 6, 4 and 15 months =-== well i just met her kids<br/>\nyesterday and they just plan seem unhappy. they barely talk (not shy<br/>\nbecause the girl kept coming to me and climbing up on my lap and<br/>\ngravitating toward me all night), they are not at all &#39;rowdy&#39; which I<br/>\nguess maybe my boys are just overly...  and I just sense a feeling of<br/>\nsadness in them.  The mom even joked about that maybe she&#39;s just more<br/>\nstrict because when we  were talking about timing out and only going<br/>\nby the minutes by the age of the child -- and she said she just makes<br/>\nthem stand there until she feels like letting them out of the time<br/>\nout???)   Soooo am I just being overly judgemental... by all means I<br/>\nam not a perfect parent , I&#39;m still controlling at  times, and yell<br/>\nand have even hit my children (lots better though about controlling<br/>\nthat issue...) <br/>\n<br/>\nokay and since I&#39;m on a roll , let me vent about the time my cousin<br/>\nwas down here and right away -- I recieved comments about that there<br/>\nshould be routines and bedtimes and controls etc --- which truthfully<br/>\nshe may have all that implemented but I think some of the shit was a<br/>\nfront... basically on me about control and then one time I did over<br/>\nexert myself with my boy -- she attacked that -- I shouldn&#39;t have done<br/>\nthat and if cps had seen that I would be in trouble.......and that I<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t yell so much... Granted I shouldn&#39;t and since then even<br/>\nthough she pissed me off I haven&#39;t --- however I do know when i&#39;m<br/>\nstressed I&#39;m harder on the boys (not an excuse just acknowledging and<br/>\nwilling to change).....However, I couldn&#39;t see where her harsh<br/>\ncontrols were great -- yep she had a trained daughter but..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I guess my ramblings are that I want to be accepted for my<br/>\nchoices as a parent and I want to except others also...Should I gently<br/>\nsuggested alternative ways to discipling? or just keep my mouth<br/>\nshut???  I like advocating a more positive, peaceful way of parenting<br/>\nhowever not everyone gets it?  So many just argue that we need to<br/>\ncontrol this or that etc??? so I usually just shut up?  Figure if I<br/>\njust show them by actions maybe they will get it... when I have seen a<br/>\nbetter way of handling a situation I see it and try it soo????<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway if I am making any sense at all please respond.  Its getting<br/>\nwhere I don&#39;t want to even be around some parents.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36677,"nextTopicId":36704}}
