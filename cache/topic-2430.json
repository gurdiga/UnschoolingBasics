But the book Living Joyfully With <br/>\nChildren is so powerful in its practical messages of living with <br/>\nprinciples rather than rules that I certainly found it to be a <br/>\nresource and guide to creating a new path for my parenting. It has <br/>\nbeen a reliable stepping stone in my journey, even if my growth in <br/>\ntrusting my son has surpassed their expectations and experiences (as <br/>\ndescribed at that point in their parenting) with their children. I  <br/>\nalso know that I do know alot worth sharing with my son, but <br/>\nthat &#39;sharing with him&#39; and &#39;deciding for him&#39; are vastly different <br/>\nprocesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheauthor&#39;s children are certainly represented as opinionated and <br/>\noutspoken without censure even if the final say was the <br/>\nparents/authors on some moral and health issues. It seems to <br/>\nrepresent respectful parenting, if not fully self-determining <br/>\nchildren, at least as represented for a mainstream audience. One of <br/>\nthe tenets was that it is easier to see when you have given up too <br/>\nmuch control than when you hold too much control. It has useful ideas <br/>\nor perspectives if one is considering changing one&#39;s beliefs of how <br/>\nmuch one needs to control their children. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic principle is &quot;do onto others (your children) as you would <br/>\nhave them do onto you&quot;. Obviously, fears are a large part of why we <br/>\nchoose to control our children and many adults do embrace wanting <br/>\nsomeone to decide for them so that they have a sense of security. <br/>\n<br/>\nHelen Keller said that &#39;security is a superstition&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; <br/>\n&lt;meplusfive@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pat,<br/>\n&gt;   I have seen the book.

I see<br/>\nthe mistakes but want to move forward.I hope this comes across the way I<br/>\nintend it. I think that most parents I know want this kind of relationship<br/>\nbut when they see their child having a strong opinion or being able to say<br/>\nwhat they think, that is where the decision comes in to &quot;make them mind.&quot; It<br/>\ncan be scarry to have a little child share their thoughts or want to do<br/>\nsomething you don&#39;t think is ok.It makes adults re-evaluate everything and<br/>\nthat isn&#39;t comfortable. To really dig deep and find out why don&#39;t I want my<br/>\nchild to do this? Where is this uncomfortable feeling coming from? Why do I<br/>\nfeel threatened? Or even....what is a better alternative or solution? All<br/>\nchallenging to an adult.\r<br/>\n  I still have areas I feel uncomfortable about and am working through.<br/>\nRight now it is tv. How much is enough or too much? Am I the one to say when<br/>\nit is? How do I convey that a show is one I would prefer they not watch<br/>\nwithout just saying NO?  It may sound easy but habit pops in there sometimes<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  I can relate to the idea of having everything &quot;perfect&quot; including yourself<br/>\n But it is so elusive.

I have intended to purchase the tapes several <br/>\ntimes and have become side tracked with life. I think they would be <br/>\nexcellent for listening to in the car. I just found How to Talk So <br/>\nYour Kids Will Listen... on CD at the library! I thought I&#39;d listen <br/>\nto it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have posted on Amazon about the Pearl&#39;s book on child abuse. How <br/>\nthey are legally writing this is heartwrenching and repulsive from my <br/>\npoint of view, considering I experienced many of their &quot;tools&quot; in <br/>\nchildhood and am now estranged from my dad and distant with my mom. <br/>\nCertainly, I had to seek new and healthier role models for parenting <br/>\nand this is quite a challenge everytime I research and choose <br/>\ndifferently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to do everything &quot;perfectly&quot; for so many years that I lived <br/>\nin fear of failing. And I feared living without rules. Fear and rules <br/>\nfelt like the path to security and success. Unfortunatly, fear can be <br/>\nparalyzing and limiting. How does one plan for every &quot;what if...&quot;? It <br/>\nhad been a struggle for me to trust anyone until my husband and then <br/>\nour son came into my life. I learned that trust is the opposite of <br/>\nfear. I knew that I could trust my son and had learned that I would <br/>\nneed to learn to trust my own judgement in parenting without external <br/>\nrules. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff was eye-opening about <br/>\nchildren&#39;s innate desire to learn and self-correct. Her observations <br/>\nof cultures where children were trusted to make decisions without <br/>\ninterference from adults and develop judgement through learning from <br/>\ntheir environment was novel and not fear-based living. I began <br/>\nfollowing this path for my son while he was quite young (6 months+). <br/>\nI was amazed to see him flourish when all I had to do was control my <br/>\nfears and trust him (certainly not easy for a controlling Type A <br/>\nperson though).<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, controlling my fears of every &quot;what it...&quot; and trusting <br/>\nhim to use his judgement became easier with experience and <br/>\nobservation of our &quot;little scientist&quot;. He learned so much and so <br/>\nquickly from having opportunities to try and try again. &quot;Fail&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;misbehave&quot; are not concepts we embrace reguarding his actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd controlling my fears and trusting him became harder as his <br/>\nexplorations became more extensive. But, I had practiced holding my <br/>\nfears in check for at least a year by then, and I had learned that I <br/>\ncould trust him to use his judgement and he had learned to trust my <br/>\njudgement. So, we had a mutual relationship of trust. Now, my fears <br/>\nonly pop up when others are involved that I don&#39;t know (like <br/>\nstrangers in strange places).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe turned three in June, I trust him so much more than I ever <br/>\nimagined I could even trust a 10 year old. He has no concept of <br/>\nhiding things or dishonesty, he has no reasons to fear life. He <br/>\nexplores the world with vigor and self-confidence. He requests and <br/>\naccepts help willingly. He is is opinionated and determined. He knows <br/>\nhis mind and challenges me to find common preferences when it might <br/>\nbe easier to just do things my way. But we are relaxed and flexible, <br/>\nas I never was when I lived with fear and perfectionism.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat, who got melancholy about her baby growing up too fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; <br/>\n&lt;meplusfive@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pat,<br/>\n&gt;  I have been reading these authors and found their insights <br/>\n </span></blockquote>invaluable.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It was on unschooling.com that I first read of parents letting their<br/>\n&gt; children really choose for themselves.At first it sounded absurd <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it.Unschooling to me was no curriculum <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; have since learned it is a lifestyle.Sometimes I would really be <br/>\n </span></blockquote>challenged<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and even bugged by what I read and couldn&#39;t get the ideas out of my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>mind.

I can tell you that it&#39;s SO much better when your children are your companions and can trust you to help them, not control them.<br/>\nAll the sugar in the world will hurt them a lot less than the emotional damage that gets inflicted when punishment or control are used.<br/>\nI decided a long time ago, that their emotional health was the most important factor in a healthy life and sugar, fat etc... was WAY down on the list of potentially damagine substances.

It&#39;s real not out of some book from an expert.\r<br/>\n When I shared what I have been hearing from other parents even<br/>\nhomeschooling parents being in charge since they are Mom/Dad ....it is no<br/>\nlonger me  philosophy but what is around me. It has been in the past and I<br/>\nstill have remnants to work through.\r<br/>\n  Have you read &quot;To train up a child&quot; by the Pearls? They live a few hours<br/>\nfrom here. I was given that book by a friend and others have recommended it.<br/>\nI share that to say that around here it is &quot;normal&quot; to hear new parents tell<br/>\nhow they are sitting toys around on the floor and they swat babies hands<br/>\nwhen they reach for something. Only the toy offered to them is ok to touch.<br/>\nBabies/ toddlers are taught to sit on a small piece of carpet during<br/>\nmeetings and not get off.Or Mama carries a switch to &quot;train&quot; jr.\r<br/>\n  I know from experience this doesn&#39;t teach respect and create a peaceful<br/>\nenvironment for kids. It is easy for Mom/Dad.\r<br/>\n  Have you ever listened to Naomi Aldorts tapes? I am interested but don&#39;t<br/>\nknow anyone that has. They are on Todlers and then another set on Children..<br/>\nI think.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nsharon\r<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140240070,"authorName":"eriksmama2001","from":"&quot;eriksmama2001&quot; &lt;scubamama@...&gt;","profile":"eriksmama2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: need to learn more","postDate":"1091536985","msgId":2454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNlbzE4cCt1Z2dsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxMEYwNEM4LjAwMDAwNy4wMjQ4OEBKSU0tMldNU1VRRVFKWEc+"},"prevInTopic":2452,"nextInTopic":2455,"prevInTime":2453,"nextInTime":2455,"topicId":2430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I found the book Living Joyfully With Children by Win and Bill Sweet to be inspirational and practical.

Before I used to put off my things until she was sleeping.<br/>\nSo computer during her nap, not long enough. Eating certain foods while she<br/>\nwas napping or sleeping because I didn&#39;t want her to see it yet. Watching TV<br/>\nonly while she slept. So I put off a lot of my interests and needs and wants<br/>\nwaiting until she was asleep. So when she didn&#39;t go to sleep as I had<br/>\nplanned I was HUGELY resentful of her for &quot;doing this to me&quot;. Now I don&#39;t<br/>\nwait or put off ME for her as much. Still somethings, hey if I am going to<br/>\neat an entire bag of salt and vinegar chips I wait for her to be asleep, or<br/>\nto watch a movie with my dh we wait. But there are so many less things that<br/>\nI put off until she is asleep that I am way less resentful and so less<br/>\npunitive. And in turn I do see a difference in her behaviour. She is not<br/>\nfeeling punished for being a 4 year old and so is more comfortable with me.<br/>\nI still see her apologizing for things she doesn&#39;t need to and asking if I<br/>\nam mad her a lot, I guess it will take time for her to see that I have<br/>\nchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note and perhaps unrelated, I find your choice of words<br/>\ninteresting. People who unschool don&#39;t NOT discipline. Discipline means to<br/>\nteach, not to punish. So in the past you (and me) may have punished, but it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t necessarily discipline. It took me awhile to get that. But I<br/>\ndiscipline my daughter all the time, through teaching her. I do this with<br/>\nmodeling (now thankfully) and through open discussions with her and just<br/>\nplain telling her sometimes. But I am very conscious of the difference<br/>\nbetween discipline and punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find the transition to unschooling or a more relaxed style of<br/>\nliving easier, if you don&#39;t think you have to give up discipline all<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Sharon Thomas [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meplusfive@...\">meplusfive@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Monday, August 02, 2004 6:01 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] need to learn more<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi, <br/>\nI am really new to this list but hope to continue learning as I &quot;lurk&quot;.<br/>\nWe are working to replace the punishment/discipline mode we have used into<br/>\nrespectful daily living.<br/>\n  If you don&#39;t mind my asking: have any of you noticed a difference in how<br/>\nyour children respond or act vs. disciplined children?I have read some<br/>\npeoples posts other places and while I like the results they speak of I have<br/>\nnot lived near anyone that has done this.The proof is in the pudding so to<br/>\nspeak and I hope to hear that any making changes have seen a difference.<br/>\n  Have any of you disciplined then learned that it wasn&#39;t helping or working<br/>\nand then made changes?

We&#39;re all here to help each <br/>\nother and more than happy to share info and experiences.  First <br/>\nthing I&#39;d ask you is what kinds of things are you talking about that <br/>\nyou had said, &quot;do it or else...&quot;  As for their overcoming those <br/>\nlessons, I&#39;d say it&#39;s just going to take time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to those do it or else things.  Are they things that really <br/>\nmust be done?  I know I was raised with a heavy do it or else... and <br/>\nI followed suit for a long time with my own until I got a clue.  I <br/>\nfound most of it was a knee jerk reaction and not thoughtful in its <br/>\ndispensation.  I was just aping what I had been told growing up. <br/>\nLots of what I said &quot;must be done&quot; really didn&#39;t need be, after I <br/>\nthought about it.  Room cleaning?  Close the door if you don&#39;t want <br/>\nto see it.  It&#39;s their room.  If they&#39;re young, you can help them - <br/>\nmake it game you do together.  If older and they don&#39;t want to clean <br/>\nit, let it go.  Family area messy?  Shared space = shared <br/>\nresponsibility.  Tell them it&#39;s hard for you to do it alone and it <br/>\nwould be great to tidy up together since it was mussed together.  <br/>\nHelp putting the groceries away?  Mine are great about this sort of <br/>\nthing - a situation wherein I need help, I&#39;ve explained how it <br/>\nhelps.. and I help them as well when they ask.  Mutual respect and <br/>\nmutual consideration for each other&#39;s feelings and needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference has been in lots of explaining the &quot;whys&quot; of my <br/>\nrequests to them.  None of that &quot;just do it cuz I&#39;m the mom&quot; stuff.  <br/>\nIf they understand why and how it will help, they&#39;re most likely to <br/>\nbe happy to jump in and do with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sense?
