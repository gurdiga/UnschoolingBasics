When someone","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-511703179\">&quot;She generally can&#39;t play with<br/>\nother children without me being there. Socially she is a disaster,<br/>\nwhich I&#39;ve been told is another trait of AS/SPD. When someone<br/>\nwrongs her she hits or punches them. And it could be over something<br/>\nas simple as they won&#39;t play the game she wants to play. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to empathize..I have a 5 y.o. that sounds a lot like<br/>\nyour child. He actually laughs sometimes when someone gets hurt at his<br/>\nown hands. He DOES have empathy, but it doesn&#39;t show when he&#39;s in an<br/>\nemotional moment. Getting physical with someone takes almost NO<br/>\nprovocation....if they aren&#39;t understanding him, or want to do<br/>\nsomething different, he&#39;ll lash out easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Kelly that you have to be very present with these kids.<br/>\nIt&#39;s exhausting sometimes, but I truly believe they ARE developing the<br/>\ntraits to be socially balanced, it&#39;s just taking longer for them.<br/>\nHe&#39;s getting better, little by little. I also just started him on a<br/>\nsupplement with the healthy oils (someone else mentioned this) not<br/>\nfiguring it will change him one bit, but MIGHT help take the edge off<br/>\nand make things more bearable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he got angry or upset in the past, it took a good 1/2 hour to<br/>\nre-focus and get back to a place where he could be reasoned with on<br/>\nany level. He can now do it in just a few minutes sometimes. So I KNOW<br/>\nwe&#39;re helping him gain new tools (and he&#39;s developing in his own time)<br/>\nbut sometimes it seems like we say the same thing 20x to no avail. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that my words &quot;use gentle hands&quot; or &quot;use words&quot; are<br/>\nprobably falling on deaf ears, but I&#39;m right there with him and<br/>\neventaully I think it will click for him. In the mean time, I breathe<br/>\na LOT and focus on his beautiful eyes and sweet cheeks...which help me<br/>\nreconnect with how wonderful this child IS. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18196,"nextTopicId":18292}}
