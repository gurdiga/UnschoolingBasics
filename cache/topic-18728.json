I told the children that we are on<br/>\n&quot;vacation&quot; as Ren wisely said that I should do.  We had a WONDERFUL<br/>\nday!  A few weeks ago something came on the Discovery Channel about<br/>\nthe Titanic and I asked Zak if he&#39;d like to watch the movie.  Titanic<br/>\nwith Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet came in Netflix and BOTH of my<br/>\nchildren LOVED the movie.  What a totally UNSCHOOLY movie with<br/>\nLeonardo&#39;s character helping Winslets character learn how to live in<br/>\nthe moment and be free from the pressures and constraints of<br/>\nconforming to class and peer pressure.  The whole time I&#39;m thinking,<br/>\n&quot;Wow, this is the movie I needed today!&quot;  LOL, I don&#39;t believe in God<br/>\nbut boy, what a coincidence.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur Zoo Newsletter came in the mail and Brooke wanted me to read that<br/>\nto her.  She then invited me to come and read about Bottlenose<br/>\nDolphins on Zoo Tycoon, it was very informative.  She loves Zoo<br/>\nTycoon, I didn&#39;t make her play it, or make her read about the<br/>\ndolphins, she just wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the absolute best part was...Zak is interested in Bonsai Trees and<br/>\nalso rock gardens.  We went to a nursery and turns out that the<br/>\nhusband of the wife we met has been a Bonsai artist for over 25 years.<br/>\n It started as a hobby and he turned his passion into a business. <br/>\nAnyhoo, we met him briefly as he was on his way to a doctor<br/>\nappointment.  His wife gave us a brief overview of Bonsai trees and<br/>\ngave me a brochure for a Bonsai Club here in the area, tonight there<br/>\nis a meeting and in January they are having a Bonsai master come to<br/>\ntown.  Then the nice woman said that her husband would SHOW Zachary<br/>\nhow to do the art of Bonsai.  Zak was beaming!  When we got to the car<br/>\nI asked Zak if he wanted to go to the meeting to which he replied,<br/>\n&quot;Yes!&quot;  Then I mentioned,&quot;You know, maybe in exchange for being able<br/>\nto DO Bonsai trees with this man, we could offer to hand water the<br/>\nplants at their nursery a couple of times a week.&quot;  Zak said that he<br/>\nwould love to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou all, we really didn&#39;t set out to intentionally learn anything<br/>\nyesterday...it was our first deschooling day and everything sort of<br/>\njust fell into our laps, so to speak.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18720,"nextTopicId":18733}}
