Very cool, indeed, lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nPinky  Dinky Doo is a<br/>\nreally good, creative cartoon.<br/>\nNot bad! My kids have gotten into that too.

Very<br/>\ngentle characters. I love Miss Spiders  Sunny Patch. My daughter loves<br/>\nCaillou, but I&#39;m sorry we ever let the  little monster into the house. She<br/>\nlearned 3 things from Caillou: how to  whine in earnest; how to get under<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s skin by calling them &quot;stupid;&quot;  and how to express her<br/>\nupset/frustration/anger by saying &quot;bad  -_________(mommy, daddy, Clio - the<br/>\ndog,  Pippa - the baby sister,  friends,&quot; you name it. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll grow<br/>\nout of it, but, jeez. <br/>\nWow, we have had the total opposite happen. That&#39;s interesting, and not  <br/>\nsurprising, that kids get different things from different shows. Julian has  <br/>\nbecome more patient with his little sister, and I it happened just after seeing  a <br/>\nfew episodes in which Caillou was mean to his little sister. I&#39;ve heard others <br/>\n say the same withg about the whining, but not sir us, thank goodness. <br/>\nProbably  one reason I can stand the show, is that I&#39;m not seeing any bad side <br/>\neffects for  us.

Wonderpets is fun, and the music is<br/>\nterrific - done by  real orchestra, what a rarity! Pinky Dinky Doo is a<br/>\nreally good, creative cartoon. Wow Wow Wubbzy is a very sweet cartoon about<br/>\nthree very different friends. Kipper is a must-see in our opinion! Very<br/>\ngentle characters. I love Miss Spiders Sunny Patch. My daughter loves<br/>\nCaillou, but I&#39;m sorry we ever let the little monster into the house. She<br/>\nlearned 3 things from Caillou: how to whine in earnest; how to get under<br/>\nsomeone&#39;s skin by calling them &quot;stupid;&quot; and how to express her<br/>\nupset/frustration/anger by saying &quot;bad -_________(mommy, daddy, Clio - the<br/>\ndog,  Pippa - the baby sister, friends,&quot; you name it. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll grow<br/>\nout of it, but, jeez. Cyber Chase is a math-centered cartoon meant for older<br/>\nkids, but it is her latest favorite, and she really is starting to<br/>\nunderstand some of the math concepts they present.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: things a 4 y/o girl would enjoy watching?","postDate":"1185154022","msgId":25104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4MTA1NitlMzZlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwNzIyMTUzN3k3YmZjMjI3NWliMGM5ZDU3YTA5YmM1MzgyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25103,"nextInTopic":25105,"prevInTime":25103,"nextInTime":25105,"topicId":25079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~***They re careful to only talk about God, so it is inter-faith language.

He likes a lot of shows, and most are  <br/>\navailable for rentals I think...<br/>\n <br/>\nFetch With Ruff Ruffman and Maya and Miguel - both are aimed at older kids,  <br/>\nlike 8+ I think, but he loves them, so I thought I&#39;d add that in there. <br/>\n <br/>\nLittle Bear, I agree is very unschooly. We also love that show! <br/>\n <br/>\nSchooly ones he likes are Franklin and The Berenstain Bears and Cailliou. <br/>\n <br/>\nBlue&#39;s Clues is one he and his little sister like (she actually is the  <br/>\nbiggest Caillou fan I&#39;ve seen, lol), and I like it because Blue is a girl, Mr.  <br/>\nSalt and Mrs. Pepper are a great couple and there are other little do-dads that  <br/>\nare non gender specific which I like :) <br/>\n <br/>\nWe like Mr. Rogers, too. Julian is just starting to really enjoy it. <br/>\n <br/>\nOobie. Wow, at first I thought it was odd, but I am now so in love with  that <br/>\nshow! Bare-handed puppets with simple language. &quot;Granpoo&quot; is DEF. a hippy  in <br/>\ndisguise ;) His respect towards the musicians is apparent in his tone and the <br/>\n sad way he shakes his head at the business person makes me laugh each time. <br/>\nWe  all love that show here, lol...<br/>\n <br/>\nBasically, we spend most of our TV time with Noggin when it comes to kid  <br/>\nshos. No toy commercials- I love that. Even less than what PBS does, they have  <br/>\nsponsers with non-adds, lol, but Noggin&#39;s are fewer, and this is an important  <br/>\nfactor to me - though I know this is for a TV free family, I just wanted to  <br/>\nmention that. We also watch selected programs about space and weather, as <br/>\nJulian  is really interested in those things and we also watch many of the cooking <br/>\nshows  on FoodNetwork. I&#39;d bet that there are cooking shows rentable, perhaps <br/>\neven  aimed at kids. Alton Brown is a HUGE hit for the most part (Julian gets <br/>\nscared  of the costuming that goes on at times), but his favorite is Rachel <br/>\nRay, lol! <br/>\n <br/>\nanyway...lol...um yeah, so those are my suggestions ;) <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:things a 4 y/o girl would enjoy watching?","postDate":"1185129644","msgId":25095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwNzIyMTE0MHI2YTNjMTc4OHAxNDBiNWQxZWQzYTMxY2I0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2QzIzRERCLTkzRTYtNEE5Qy1BQ0M4LUFCQTc3RDEzODkyMkBjaG9vc2Vvcmdhbmljcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE2QzIzRERCLTkzRTYtNEE5Qy1BQ0M4LUFCQTc3RDEzODkyMkBjaG9vc2Vvcmdhbmljcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25094,"nextInTopic":25096,"prevInTime":25094,"nextInTime":25096,"topicId":25079,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
