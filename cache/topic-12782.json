It drove me CRAZY when my kids were in school! <br/>\n(Thank God we finally came to our senses!)  One yr., when my girls were in 1st <br/>\nand 2nd grade, I got a notice sent home saying that they were asking all the <br/>\nyounger kids to bring snacks in EVERY DAY for the older kids that were doing the <br/>\nMEAP tests! I couldn&#39;t believe it. My kids were so excited about being able to <br/>\nbe supportive of the &quot;older&quot; kids in school. (I didn&#39;t mind them wanting to <br/>\nbe helpful but not in those terms!) They had these little kids all geared up <br/>\nabout what &quot;GREAT KIDS&quot; they would be *IF* they brought in snacks for the older <br/>\nkids and *supporting* the older kids while they did the test!&quot;. So, the kids <br/>\nwho&#39;s Mom&#39;s didn&#39;t go for the bull.... the school sent out were to feel like <br/>\nthey weren&#39;t such &quot;GREAT KIDS&quot;. The whole thing was ridiculous. That was all the <br/>\nschool talked about, that was all that seemed important to them almost the <br/>\nwhole year! ICK!!!!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest dd just told me she had to take it in the 4th grade (right before <br/>\nwe pulled them out) she said she remembered that she failed the science one. <br/>\nShe LOVES science and always has but that was when she started to hate it! The <br/>\nteacher she had that yr. for science had gone through a divorce and it showed A <br/>\nLOT in her classroom although, I think her personality was always the same, <br/>\ndivorced or not! She was like a drill sergeant. She screamed at my youngest one <br/>\nonce when she was coming into school, &quot;TEN MINUTES ON THE WALL (this would be <br/>\nat her recess time) FOR YOUR SQUEAKY SHOES!!!!!&quot; Casey is a very soft spoken <br/>\nkid and when she tried to apologize and tell her that she couldn&#39;t help it, <br/>\nthat her shoes were wet from coming in from the rain, the lady screamed at her <br/>\nagain and said &#39;OK, I&#39;LL TAKE PITY ON YOU *THIS TIME* AND ONLY GIVE YOU FIVE <br/>\nMINUTES! BUT IT&#39;S ONLY BC I LIKE YOU!&quot; Oh how we LOVE unschooling! &lt;g&gt; Can you <br/>\nimagine how many there other poor kids out there that have to endure treatment <br/>\nlike that?!! How awful! I talked to the teacher about it and of course she <br/>\nmade it sound like it wasn&#39;t that bad any way, bla bla bla.<br/>\n        _____________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m sorry I have gone on so long.

I have been helping him during the last month for years...each","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-49079293\">My little brother always has to be &quot;pushed through&quot; the last month <br/>\nof school (private school).  I have been helping him during the last <br/>\nmonth for years...each year it is the same, he gets behind in his <br/>\nwork, then rushes to catch up before school is out.  I push and push <br/>\nand he makes it by the skin of his teeth. <br/>\n Last night I helped him study for a history test.  Today I picked <br/>\nhim up at school and he told me he made 43! on it.  I feel like it <br/>\nis my fault somehow for not helping him enough, but there is just no <br/>\nfoundation there to build the knowledge on.  He was supposed to be <br/>\nlearning about WWII...if he was interested in WWII wouldn&#39;t this be <br/>\na much different post?  He doesn&#39;t care a flip about WWII, and no <br/>\npushing from me will make a difference. <br/>\n I can really see how reading posts here and at other unschooling <br/>\nsites has brought me to where I am now.  I just wish he was allowed <br/>\nto follow his own path and learn what he needs, instead of being <br/>\nforced to learn about something that doesn&#39;t interest him and <br/>\nprobably never will.  Mom is grounding him and making him research <br/>\nand write reports on WWII...I tried to point out that using that as <br/>\na punishment wouldn&#39;t help him to &quot;love&quot; learning any, but she just <br/>\npooh-pooh that idea.  ARGH!  <br/>\n Each spring he begs me to homeschool him &quot;next year&quot;, but his <br/>\nparents have ideas about &quot;socialization&quot;, and how would he play <br/>\nbasketball?  Bleah.  They drive me crazy.  I wish they could see <br/>\nthat dragging him through his work is just putting numbers on his <br/>\nreport card, and they don&#39;t mean anything.<br/>\n He also failed a Science test.  I didn&#39;t help him study for it, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to study and mom admitted it was one of the most boring <br/>\nscience lessons she has ever seen.  WHY does he have to slog through <br/>\na science lesson on the stupid crust of the earth?  It&#39;s there...if <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t, he would fall into the center of the earth and <br/>\nmelt....what more does he need to know?  How rocks break down into <br/>\nsoil?...okay, give the kid a chance to play outside with rocks and <br/>\ndirt and he will figure it out...make a compost pile and he will <br/>\nlearn how other things break down, also.  I&#39;m just so unhappy with <br/>\nit all.  <br/>\n On another note, my SIL said today that her kids are in the middle <br/>\nof a MONTH of state-mandated testing.  I had NO IDEA they tested for <br/>\na MONTH!  They spend all year preparing for this test, then they <br/>\nspend a month working on it and heaven help you if you happen to <br/>\nbe &quot;below average&quot; they figure out a way to get you out of their <br/>\nsystem before the test so they can get their money for a passing <br/>\ngrade.  One test a year...imagine for a minute you had to spend 6? <br/>\n8? hours a day preparing for a test...you can do nothing <br/>\nelse...&quot;Yes, that is an interesting rock you picked up, but it&#39;s not <br/>\non the test so put it down...&quot;  OMG!  I would go mad.  I feel so <br/>\nsorry for the kids who have to do those things.  <br/>\n My children, on the other hand, are exploring things that are of <br/>\ninterest to them.  My little one is bird-watching...we just got her <br/>\na journal to write/paste pictures of the birds she identifies.  My <br/>\noldest is interested in old/foreign coins...we bought her a <br/>\nscrapbook to put them in, and she is planning on cutting out <br/>\npictures of the places they came from and making a really neat <br/>\nscrapbook with them.  Things THEY have come up with on their <br/>\nown...learning that will have meaning and depth for them, because <br/>\nthey are interested...not forcing them to learn about WWII because <br/>\nit is in the scope and sequence for this year, or learning about Nat <br/>\nTurner because it is on the stupid state test.  <br/>\n I&#39;m sorry I have gone on so long.  I just really needed to vent, <br/>\nand this is the only group I am on that will (hopefully) understand <br/>\nwhat I am trying to say, and what irritates me about seeing children <br/>\nbeing forced to &quot;learn&quot; things that have no meaning.  <br/>\n:)<br/>\nPaige (who feels better now)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12759,"nextTopicId":12783}}
