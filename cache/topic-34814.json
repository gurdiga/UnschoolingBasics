You have no idea what this set in motion! We have this old swimming pool we want to convert into something else, and so far we thought about a greenhouse/studio combination. But it turns out that a stage would be such a great thing. The kids would love doing theater shows and forming their own group, I have been wanting to do a dance group etc. So now we are actively thinking on how to make the old swimming pool into a performance space, surrounded by flowers and doubling as a hang-out with firepit...
