I&#39;m not new to unschooling although rather new to applying <br/>\nunschooling to our lives. :)  I think I might be able to give you some suggestions but I&#39;m <br/>\nleaving the deep unschooling advice to the veteran unschoolers on the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I caught how old your son is.  Is he old enough to walk the dog by himself? Or <br/>\nmaybe with you DP?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my suggestions are for you personally although your son could end up inerested <br/>\nas he watches you.  You can still exercise with a broken toe... it just will look differently.  <br/>\nThink about it... the rest of your body works, right? Do you have free weights?  And how <br/>\nbout one of those big exercise balls?  There is so much you can do with those things.  <br/>\nCourse, the only thing with the ball that you would have to watch is if you lose your <br/>\nbalance and use your injured foot to stop.  You would have to be the judge as to whether <br/>\nor not that would be a right for you.  But... free weights are great where you can sit in a <br/>\nchair and work body parts.  You can do floor exercises too.  Just don&#39;t do anything that <br/>\nwould hurt your foot.  There are lots of CD&#39;s and books with lots of ideas.  I&#39;d be happy to <br/>\nsuggest something if you like.  The key is to keep your body active... moving in a way <br/>\nthat&#39;s safe for you.  It is possilbe.  It might not be what you&#39;re used to right now but I think <br/>\nit would help you feel better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 14.  He and I go to the gym together... have been for about a year.   This week <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that late at night he&#39;s up in his room with the free weights working out.  Next <br/>\nthing I know he&#39;s coming down to juice.  It floors me that this boy juices.  Not all the time <br/>\nbut often.  Most kids his age won&#39;t even eat vegetables much less juice them ... LOL.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnot forced him to do any of this.  He does it on his own because the equipment is here and  <br/>\nthe example is set before him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought for your son is a rebounder ... especially if he&#39;s too young for weight <br/>\nlifting.  My kids have had so much fun on our rebounder.  Who doesn&#39;t like to bounce and <br/>\nit is so healthy in so many different ways.  It works every cell in the body.  If it&#39;s something <br/>\nyou don&#39;t currently have maybe try looking for a good one on Ebay.  I just don&#39;t <br/>\nrecommend the cheap $25 ones.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nShileen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: unschooling exercise/physical health","postDate":"1194275315","msgId":27562,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1Mzk0Q0Q5QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":27555,"nextInTopic":27566,"prevInTime":27561,"nextInTime":27563,"topicId":27554,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One thing my DS (9) loves is a mini trampoline - he can bounce AND play videogames most of the time (not all games but many work just fine).

Does it really make a huge difference if you live a more sedentary life during your recovery? Does your son miss the more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1751431078\">How long are you going to be laid up? Does it really make a huge difference if you live a more sedentary life during your recovery? Does your son miss the more active aspects of his life? Where I am is solidly shorter and colder days, and Simon and Linnaea are less keen to go outside. Is this a more normal rhythm to your son&#39;s life that you&#39;ve missed noticing because school has come between you and your view of him? Is part of your worry about having time on your hands and doubt in your mind and concern that somehow you&#39;ve just jumped into the scariest waters you&#39;ve ever swum in? Is this more about your frustration with being idle than it is about his?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son wants to be more active, if he is missing the moving and the biking, find a park you can drive to and put his bike in the back of the car and go. Encourage your husband to take him out without you. See if there is a zoo or a museum where they have wheelchairs for public use and go there. If he isn&#39;t missing the active life, if he is happy with the video games and the board games and the hanging out with you while you are on the mend, revel in that. How fantastic to think that your son is enjoying what you have on offer so much that he is happy to go slow, to just be with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suffer, mildly, from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SADs) so when the days grow shorter so does my temper. It is important for me to remember that, not only because I can self-medicate by getting outside more and being more active when everything in me is telling me to hunker down and eat, snarling at anyone who comes my way, but also because it means that my vision is skewed by my own unhappiness. It means that I may hear all the negative voices in my head speaking in a chorus about how badly my life is going and how I need to up what we are doing, and that I am failing everyone around me. Maybe something like that is happening to your happy thoughts? Maybe as you itch to move and dance and your toe keeps you painfully aware of your need to sit and heal, the voices of fear and doubt are coloring your view of your son? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were you I would try and recognize the true root of my fears. You are walking a new path. You are taking your family by the hand and jumping in the deep end with no knowledge of how warm the water is (except, obviously, for the 2 years reporting by internet sources). I was trying to show a friend of ours how to swim the other day. Not even how to swim, but how to float in water. Y&#39;know the way if you relax and lie back, spreading your legs and arms out, the water will keep you bouyant? But he was too afraid of the power of the water, too afraid of his impending drowning to be able to relax. Just relax. Listen to the voices that made unschooling feel like the right thing. Let the water support you, don&#39;t let your fears drag you down. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the start of Sept I broke my big toe and, because it&#39;s a break <br/>\nright at the joint, I&#39;m still not working (normally about 18hrs/wk).<br/>\nNow, I love not working, but usually me and my family&#39;s normal course<br/>\nof exercise would be to go on bike rides, walk to the park, play a<br/>\nbunch in the yard, hike, build stuff, go to the beach, whatever.

Not a lot, but noticeable. And DP sees it as a result of<br/>\nDS being too sedentary---playing video games/watching movies and<br/>\nthings along those lines. Our deschooling looks like what I&#39;ve<br/>\nread--lots of tv, video games. And cards, board games, coloring, etc.<br/>\nBecause of what I&#39;ve read over the last 2 yrs, I don&#39;t believe that me<br/>\nlimiting tv or videos will positively affect me or my son&#39;s health. <br/>\n <br/>\n I read (here?) in regard to concerns about weight and/or food<br/>\nissues--to add variety or healthy stuff to the food intake and not<br/>\nfocus on diet or restriction of unhealthy stuff. I really dig this<br/>\nbecause it feels so much more loving to me. This is what I&#39;ve tried to<br/>\ndo in the past when I&#39;ve worried about food in our family. Add more<br/>\nvariety of foods and go outside and play more. And every thing&#39;s<br/>\noptional, not some weird bossy drill sargent thing. <br/>\n So, with my DP&#39;s (and my own) concerns about my boy&#39;s<br/>\nweight/health---how do I add the &quot;good stuff&quot; (i.e. exercise) when I&#39;m<br/>\nlimited physically right now? And ...how do I unschool the food? I<br/>\nhave to confess, food is the biggest issue for me to unschool. (That<br/>\nand jackets actually. But now, when my boy says, &quot;But I&#39;m not cold.&quot; I<br/>\njust breathe in and say, &quot;ok.&quot; with my outbreath.) <br/>\n <br/>\n I guess I used to allay my fears of too much fast food with playing<br/>\noutside or some other exercise thing. Now, I&#39;m faced with not being<br/>\nable to run around and do stuff so I&#39;m worrying about the fast food/no<br/>\nexercise thing more.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I&#39;d love to get feedback on food and exercise and being<br/>\nrespectful and loving and trusting that every thing&#39;s going to be ok..<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nJuillet</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27609,"nextTopicId":27580}}
