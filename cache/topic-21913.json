He really helped me search for alternatives.  My second DS (5)<br/>\nwould fall on the ground and scream and cry and refuse to go to time <br/>\nout.  Then he would refuse to stay there screaming and crying the <br/>\nwhole time.  He would hit me.  He was very threatened by the whole <br/>\nthing.  And it never worked to calm him down.  I am so glad we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave those battles anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in an authoritarian home where we were spanked.  So to me, <br/>\nTO were a milder, more acceptable form of punishment.  But even my <br/>\noldest DS who seemed to respond well to TO built up a lot of anger <br/>\nand resentment and insecurity that we are still working through.  <br/>\nHaving no punishment seemed scarey at first.  I was afraid I would <br/>\nlose control.  Now I&#39;m so glad I did lose control.  Because it was <br/>\njust an illusion of control anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi Aldort talks about punishment in her book.  She says any <br/>\nbehavior a child has that we think is wrong or bad, represents an <br/>\nunmet need.  Putting a stop to that behavior doesn&#39;t address that <br/>\nunmet need.  So it shows up somewhere else -- like crying over every <br/>\nlittle thing or aggression or fears or all kinds of things that many <br/>\npeople say are normal parts of childhood.  Ironically some of those <br/>\nthings are what we put children into TO for.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second DS is much calmer these days.  He has even learned to <br/>\nverbalize his feelings.  He still has times when he sets his mind on <br/>\nsomething and nothing on God&#39;s green earth will change it.  I listen <br/>\nto him if he needs to cry or talk about it.  I do what I can to help <br/>\nhim meet his needs.  When there is nothing that can be done to make <br/>\nhim happy, I tell him I will listen to him if he needs to talk or <br/>\ncry about it.  My oldest son has responded well to just talking and <br/>\nbeing honest.  He still tries to hurt his brother.  When they have <br/>\nan argument, I stand very close in case I need to get between them.  <br/>\nI tried just letting them work it out, but my oldest was too <br/>\naggressive and my younger ds will take a beating from him rather <br/>\nthan give in.  I don&#39;t let them fight it out anymore.  Inevitably <br/>\nsomeone gets hit or kicked occasionally but I think it hurts their <br/>\nfeelings more than anything else.  I try to stay out of the argument <br/>\nas much as possible.  With my 2 year olds I try to put words to what <br/>\nthey are screaming at each other about.  Sometimes just hearing what <br/>\nthe other person is trying to communicate helps them solve their own <br/>\nproblem.  I occasionally do this with the older kids too.  Their <br/>\narguments can get loud and sound horrible but it only lasts for a <br/>\nshort time.  It&#39;s not long before they figure out something that <br/>\nworks for them and happily move along.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to elaborate on my previous post.  It was rushed and <br/>\nmay have sounded insensitive.  I have so much respect for every <br/>\nmother out there who has the courage to try and do something better <br/>\nfor their family.

She always has, even as a baby she would <br/>\nturn away and prefer to be put down. But that&#39;s *her* natural <br/>\ntendency, not something I&#39;ve imposed on her. My experience with my <br/>\nstepson, when he lived with us as a child, was that time-outs led <br/>\nhim to stuff down his feelings, rather than deal with them. I don&#39;t <br/>\nrecommend it. Punishment is seductive, bc kids do change their <br/>\n*behavior* as a result, but also shuts down communication big time, <br/>\nno matter how much we talk about feelings and solutions afterwards. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest overall solution I&#39;ve found to handling disputes between <br/>\nkids, siblings and others, is to be more present with the kids.

My<br/>\ndd is like that with her older brothers.  I think she feels out of<br/>\ncontrol because she is the youngest & wants to be included and she is<br/>\nthe only girl.  Therefore, not quite the same situation as you.  With<br/>\n3 kids, I find myself, making schedules of whose turn it is to do<br/>\nwhat.  Since they all want equal time with tv, computer, mom & dad,<br/>\netc.  and of course, they want the particular thing at the same time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am very new to the idea of unschooling - I understand the basic<br/>\npremise, but haven&#39;t had time to read much about how to implement it.<br/>\n So, my idea of taking turns of course, was MY idea, not theirs. <br/>\nHowever, most of the time they seem to be ok with it.  Also, when I<br/>\nask my oldest ds what he thinks we should do about the situation, he<br/>\noften comes back with a similar thought to mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n[my ds are over 3 yrs apart & dd is 2 1/2 yrs younger than 2nd ds;<br/>\noldest ds is 1 1/2 months shy of being 6 yrs older that dd]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the letting them work it out, I have not been one to do this.  I<br/>\nfeel that if there is a big age discrepancy, then this isn&#39;t possible<br/>\nuntil the younger sibling has the skills TO work it out.  In our house<br/>\nthe older ds always gets his way, if I don&#39;t step in.  Within the past<br/>\nyear, however, our younger ds seems to be more able to fend for<br/>\nhimself.  They both still want me to intervene (probably because I<br/>\nalways did).  Often, I tell them they both were at fault and need to<br/>\nwork it out or the TV, computer, etc. will be turned off.  As to<br/>\nfighting, last spring a counselor suggested to me that we send the<br/>\nboys outside to work out their differences.  It was hard for me at<br/>\nfirst, but I kept an eye/ear on the situation where they didn&#39;t see. <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t take them long to get over the original problem, but I<br/>\nnoticed that my older ds was antagonizing my younger ds (they were 9<br/>\nyr & 6 yr at the time).  I felt like this was confirming my idea that<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t old enough to work out their differences.  The counselor<br/>\nsaid to leave the antoginizer outside, until he was calm and let the<br/>\nother boy come back in.  OK, I think I got a little OT...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 4 yr old dd responds well to time-out.  By that, I mean, she goes<br/>\nto it and stays there for her 4 min.  She seems calmer & apologetic<br/>\nafterward and I talk with her about how we don&#39;t hit, bite, etc.<br/>\nbecause it hurts.  She needs to use her words, etc. or come to me.  I<br/>\nam not sure if this method truly gives her time to calm down or if she<br/>\nis learning not to express her anger.  I hope it is the former.

I found this list while searching frantically for curriculums<br/>\nafter pulling my son out of second grade in public school.  I thought<br/>\nI was using positive parenting until I started reading these groups<br/>\nand now I realize that I nag, coerce, bribe, praise, reward, and<br/>\npunish and attempt to control my kids pretty much all day long.  Oops!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my intention since they were born was to parent them respectfully.<br/>\n I did a much better job of that when they were very small and I am<br/>\nworking hard to return to being the parent I want to be.  I&#39;m<br/>\npracticing saying yes, which is a great relief to them and to me.  It<br/>\nwas hard to let my daughter dig the ashes out of the fireplace and<br/>\ndump them all on the hearth but you know what?  She had a blast for<br/>\nalmost an hour and it took all of ten minutes to clean the whole mess up!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;re all really struggling with sibling squabbles.  My daughter<br/>\nis four and she has a lot of explosions.  She was having a meltdown<br/>\nalmost every night at bedtime...screaming, kicking, biting and<br/>\nscratching me.  So ok, no more bedtime, problem solved!  But it&#39;s not<br/>\nthat easy when her brother&#39;s interests are at stake too.  I&#39;ve read<br/>\nthe Explosive Child and Siblings without Rivalry and I&#39;m still at a<br/>\nloss how to say yes to both of them when they both want to watch<br/>\ndifferent things on the same tv at the same time.  I feel forced to<br/>\nchoose sides several times a day because if I just let them work<br/>\nthings out my son invariably has to be the one to give in or he gets<br/>\nhurt because she flies into a violent rage.  I prevent outbursts in<br/>\nevery way I can think of..keeping them entertained, having the<br/>\ndiscussions recommended in Explosive Child and working out strategies<br/>\nwith her to deal with her anger, and modeling calm, gentle behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow part of what&#39;s bothering her might be my past attempts to control<br/>\nher, maybe it will just take her some time to trust me not to do her<br/>\nthat way anymore and to find better ways to control herself.  But in<br/>\nthe meantime how do I keep them from hurting each other without making<br/>\nmy son feel like he has to walk on eggshells around her?  How do I get<br/>\nthrough this while making both children feel respected and valued?
