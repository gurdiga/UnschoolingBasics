Our older children never showed an interest, which  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t bother me because i always was afraid of the whole violence  <br/>\nissue. However, watching Sam makes me aware that he isn&#39;t trying to  <br/>\nhurt people, he is using these weapons and shows of strength to help  <br/>\nhim through a developmental stage. Right now he&#39;s pretty much smaller  <br/>\nthan every threat he can imagine, bad guys of all sorts, and the  <br/>\nweapons give him a psychological advantage. He doesn&#39;t try to hurt  <br/>\npeople, he likes to playact with them and show me what he would do if  <br/>\nhe were up against a bad guy. It makes him feel more secure, and he  <br/>\nknows HOW to play with them nicely. He has more of a respect when  <br/>\nwe&#39;re around real weapons.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; 2) what do you do about college?  how do you know your kids are  <br/>\n&gt; learning<br/>\n&gt; what they need to know to get into college, if they choose to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have kids in college (my oldest is ten) and my hubby and I  <br/>\nalways expected that all of our children would go.
