We live life as if school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome folks embrace it---pouring their hearts and souls into it---even <br/>\nthough it&#39;s not for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nComedians and artists have GREAT ways of making fun of it. How do you <br/>\nthink that makes teachers and &#39;A&#39; students feel?<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the plague a zillion years ago, some ran; some stayed and helped <br/>\nothers through it; some made fun, threw parties, and lived each day as <br/>\ntheir last.<br/>\n<br/>\nAIDS is hard to embrace (such an ugly disease), but many folks do <br/>\nthat---work tirelessly to help.

But they should be allowed <br/>\nto explore thsose emotions with your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be some things that will make their insides curdle a <br/>\nbit---and that&#39;s worth examining. But if you&#39;re not there, they can&#39;t <br/>\nask your opinion/seek your help/crawl in your lap when it gets too <br/>\nintense.

I say, I&#39;m  <br/>\nsorry I just don&#39;t find these funny and I know you&#39;d like to share  <br/>\nthe humor w/ me. I don&#39;t want to shame him about finding humor in  <br/>\nthese so I&#39;ve told him why I don&#39;t like them but not gone on about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have another take on these that might shift my thinking  <br/>\nand might enable me to appreciate the yet unearthed humor or  <br/>\nsomething else that&#39;s eluding me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, let me say it loud and clear.  I find these upsetting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26068,"nextTopicId":26074}}
