We have 5 children (ages 21yr <br/>\nds, 18yr dd, 15yr ds, 6 yr dd and 2 yr dd).  Our oldest graduated <br/>\nfrom PS a few years ago.  He felt he was too far into high school <br/>\nwhen we brough the other kids home.  We started out as &quot;school at <br/>\nhomers&quot;, which usually only last a few months before we gave up.  <br/>\nTried this for two years as I worked on figuring out what would work <br/>\nbetter.  After reading a number of books, I took a deep breath and we <br/>\nstarted unschooling.  The smartest move ever made. lol!  Now I have <br/>\nthe two little girls coming up and they too will be unschooled-though <br/>\nmy 6yr dd wants to &quot;so school work&quot;.  Just when I feel great about <br/>\nunschooling, I get a child that wants school work.  She loves <br/>\nworkbooks and wants to &quot;do school&quot;, so we provide them for her to use <br/>\nif she desires.  She gives us a lot of grief about wanting to go to <br/>\nPS.  For some reason I just can&#39;t get her to understand that PS isn&#39;t <br/>\nthe best place for her.  All she sees are kids to play with, not what <br/>\nPS really is about or like.  Let me tell you, she would not be able <br/>\nto handle the strictness of PS.  This child does not like sitting <br/>\nstill and would be very head strong about her opinions which we all <br/>\nknow wouldn&#39;t go over well with the teachers.  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a very rural setting in the middle of the woods with tons <br/>\nof wild animals around us.  (A bear wiped out our bird feeders last <br/>\nnight!)  We also have a small farm with cows, chickens, a horse, <br/>\nducks and pigs---oh and rabbits, a cat and a fish and an incubator <br/>\nfull of eggs.  lol!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to live as back to basics as we can right now and are always <br/>\nworking at being more self sufficient.  We use natural healing and <br/>\nherbals, we homebirth, attachment parent, and live simply.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to getting to know everyone here better and learn more <br/>\nand more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1055,"nextTopicId":1068}}
