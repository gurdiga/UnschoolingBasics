I had 8 kids over here, 8 <br/>\n&gt; went to the pool, 8 came back over and showered, well 4 did, and we have 1 <br/>\n&gt; bathroom, did their girl things with their hair and switching clothes, then <br/>\n&gt; piled into another parents car for a bowling night.

My 2 at home and I feel like it is always summer vacation, in that we can a do what we want, when we want, whenever we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people comment that wow, you homeschool, I could never do that, I tell them, it&#39;s just like weeekends and summer break, we play and have fun as much as we can. It&#39;s a conversation stopper, but I get my point across. So, how do you have fun? That is how you do summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was like a preview for those kids around here who are in school.Their parents were saying sure because there are no big projects due, the year is basically done, just 4 more days to go through, so.. I had 8 kids over here, 8 went to the pool, 8 came back over and showered, well 4 did, and we have 1 bathroom, did their girl things with their hair and switching clothes, then piled into another parents car for a bowling night. The 2 who stayed home watched a DVD in a neighbors tent, played hair salon, and then the kids had a great big game of kick the can until the bugs came out. We didn&#39;t eat a dinner per say. It was a flowing day that summers are known for, truly kid run and they all had a blast. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14552,"nextTopicId":14629}}
