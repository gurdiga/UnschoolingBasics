Further, you can set it up as a family RESP, even if one child doesn&#39;t choose a post secondary route, another might choose that route, and be able to benefit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSavings vehicles are very diverse, too as long as you stay away from those group RESP plans, which are inflexible and have horrendous penalties for early withdrawal, or changes to how much you contribute.  It can be something as low risk as a money market fund or GIC if that&#39;s your preference -  most banks do these, so you can ask at your bank or credit union.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are currently putting away for your children anyway, the additional 20% on the 2500/year that the government kicks in is very attractive, and if your income is under 75K net per year, then you can apply for an additional grant of 10% on the first $500 every year.  I think there&#39;s an additional grant available if you&#39;re in Alberta (I&#39;m in BC, so I&#39;m not 100% certain on that one).  As long as you&#39;re willing not to touch the money (the penalties for doing so are quite severe), then you might want to consider an RESP just so you can access the additional grant money and the growth on that money.  It can add up to quite a bit over time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nNatasha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:RESPs?","postDate":"1285364830","msgId":44875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1ODA4M0E5QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":44874,"nextInTopic":44917,"prevInTime":44874,"nextInTime":44876,"topicId":44843,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have money from my pay going to a 529 and my dad has also been putting away money in 529 (or similar) plans for all of his grandkids.

Decided against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started putting $$ away for Cameron when he was a tot (maybe three?). I had a friend who had two daughters, ten and 12, <br/>\nand I asked her about college funds. She said that they had put nothing away. She expected the girls to get scholarships and grants <br/>\n(there are millions of dollars of untapped grant $$ that don&#39;t get used every year) to pay for college. She had them in a private school, <br/>\nso college wasn&#39;t going be much more than their yearly tuition at high school. They went on scholarships and grants.<br/>\nSo since he was a baby, we&#39;ve put $150/month away for Cameron. It&#39;s up to $14,000 now. Duncan has less, but he&#39;s only 14. If either decides <br/>\nto go to college, we&#39;ll be happy to help him, but we&#39;d expect to spend a lot of time researching grants and scholarships and not tap into <br/>\n*that* money. We hope to use it as a gift of a down payment for their first house or to help open a business.<br/>\nThere are many, many ways to afford college without going into debt or spending all the savings on it.
