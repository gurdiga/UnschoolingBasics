It&#39;s harder to remain calm and loving if you&#39;re thinking<br/>\n  negatively about your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Second, what does it matter when she&#39;s sleeping or awake?  She&#39;s old<br/>\n  enough to figure out when to sleep or not and maybe she&#39;s just playing<br/>\n  with time or enjoys the silence and still of night.  KWIM?  It&#39;s not<br/>\n  like she needs to get up for school or a job or anything pressing,<br/>\n  right?  It&#39;s her time to &quot;waste&quot;....just let her be.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Third, my midwife told me once before a phrase that I keep in mind<br/>\n  often....&quot;what you resist persists&quot;.  Try just relaxing about your DD&#39;s<br/>\n  sleep and wake pattern.  Stop commenting on it and just be pleasant and<br/>\n  enjoy her company while you&#39;re both awake.  Have food available in the<br/>\n  fridge for her that she can heat up in the microwave during the night.<br/>\n  Just let her &quot;play&quot; and she&#39;ll come back around to sleeping at night<br/>\n  when/if she&#39;s ready to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  FWIW, I know lots of teens who have done this and they don&#39;t go for<br/>\n  years doing it.

He his a Pediatric Neurologist at Children&#39;s<br/>\nHospital in Boston.  I have not read the book, but is was recommended to us<br/>\nby our pediatrician.  We were going to go see him at Children&#39;s, but never<br/>\ndid.  However, last week I was leaving my son at Boy Scout camp and found<br/>\nthat two families had read the book and one family had actually been<br/>\npatients of the doctor years ago.  He was extremely helpful to them and she<br/>\ncommented how he works with parents and children.  He works to form a<br/>\nschedule that meets both the parents and child&#39;s needs and temperaments.<br/>\nHer children were high energy children that do not need a lot of sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the newest research about adolescents suggests that many children change<br/>\nthere sleep patterns when they hit puberty.  It is something hormonal,<br/>\nbeyond their control.  I would not think your daughter is spoiled.  Maybe<br/>\nher sleep patterns have changed because she is changing physically.<br/>\nHowever, she could want more time alone and is using this time to process<br/>\nwhat is going on around her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went through this with my teen when she was twelve and I did not handle<br/>\nit correctly.  She is almost 15 now and things are great between us.  When<br/>\nshe was going through this stage, I made a big issue out of it.  I was<br/>\nwrong, and would have done us both a big favor if I had relaxed and let it<br/>\ngo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

Letting a child choose when they need sleep is trusting they will learn to listen to their bodies. Not that a tired child doesn&#39;t need some back rubbing, stories, cuddling...whatever calms them, but forcing a child to &quot;nap&quot; for the parent&#39;s convenience is placing one persons needs over another&#39;s. The best way is to consider all needs as equally important, in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take the &quot;easy&quot; way out with parenting whenever possible!:) It&#39;s easier to trust children than to fight their natural tendencies, it&#39;s easier to learn from life, than to try and force information down a persons throat, it&#39;s easier to be joyful than fight....although the habits that lead to confrontation can be VERY difficult to change. I should know.:) I&#39;m the queen of witchiness if I don&#39;t watch it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the best books on parenting EVER, is &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; by Winn and Bill Sweet. I used to think (like someone else mentioned) that you could either discipline your kids, or be overly permissive. I never realized there was a way to be &quot;permissive&quot; and also be a respectful, helpful guide for your children. That book shows the balance I believe, that is truly respectful and gentle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four children, two of them have fairly mellow personalities (aim to please etc..), the other two have more intense personalities. They&#39;re all very different, but we don&#39;t punish any of them.<br/>\nI was REALLY mad at Trevor today (14) for getting in his siblings faces and not respecting their boundaries. It&#39;s been an ongoing issue and I lost it. My dh stepped in and told me to chill out. While we were talking he said &quot;you want to fix him right now, but you can&#39;t. You need to leave him alone, keep the others away from them for their own peace and safety and let him figure it out in his own time...and he will.&quot;<br/>\nWow.  My dh is SO cool.:) It really helps to have a partner on board with the gentle parenting thing...when you&#39;re &quot;off&quot; they can be the balance, and vise versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyhoo...I don&#39;t think forced naps are a good idea. Can you put on a good movie for him when you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed? Find a good snack, or some water play in the sink or something that allows you a moment? Believe me, I&#39;ve lost my temper more than I&#39;d like to remember, so I wouldn&#39;t berate anyone for that.<br/>\nI would recommend finding creative options that don&#39;t include punishment, time outs or forcing things that don&#39;t agree with another person&#39;s body. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1547,"nextTopicId":1554}}
