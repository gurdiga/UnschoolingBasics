Yes, he does<br/>\nwatch shows and movies that other parents wouldn&#39;t allow their children to<br/>\nwatch. Him and his father watch Simpson&#39;s nightly which appalls my<br/>\nstep-mother that I let him watch it and yes we have had to have discussions<br/>\nabout using intelligent words not &quot;what the-!&quot; He hasn&#39;t even finished the<br/>\nsentence because Homer never does but I don&#39;t think it is appropriate<br/>\nlanguage and while I do have my bought of unintelligent explicates we all<br/>\nwork toward intelligent choose of words.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuentin watches all of the Hero movies even HellBoy which opened a whole<br/>\ndiscussion about Heaven and Hell and that some people believe there is a<br/>\nplace that bad people go and a place that good people go when they die.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter watching Indiana Jones: the Temple of Doom... We discussed that there<br/>\nwere movies that Quentin probably shouldn&#39;t watch just now. We did get him<br/>\nto watch until the end. My sister&#39;s suggestion that watching a movie even if<br/>\nit is scary that if you see it to the end usually ends with a &quot;good&quot; ending<br/>\nand will help clear the scary part. Since I knew that Indiana beat the bad<br/>\nguys and saved the day, we decided to watch until the end and he hid his<br/>\neyes when he got scared.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been movies that he has asked over and over to watch and I have<br/>\ndiscussed with him that it might scare him and that he might want to wait to<br/>\nsee these movies until he is older. We had the discussion over and over<br/>\nabout Van Helsing and eventually he said that it was okay if it was scary<br/>\nthat he really wanted to see it and that we would be here if he got too<br/>\nscared and could turn it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, he can tell you the story with enthusiasm which he does every time<br/>\nbecause he can&#39;t remember the name of the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that there isn&#39;t much I don&#39;t let him see but there are a few that I<br/>\nwarm him of and most of it is that discussion with my DH that the movie<br/>\nisn&#39;t one we should watch while cuddling with the kids in from of the Telly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon <br/>\n<br/>\n~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~.~&gt;|&lt;~ <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad we switched! <br/>\nWe are now safer and healthier, using toxic-free products and saving money,<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\nCall (212) 990-6214 for a 10 minute prerecorded presentation or contact me<br/>\ndirectly.<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Joyce Fetteroll<br/>\nSent: Saturday, January 21, 2006 2:38 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about tv<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 21, 2006, at 1:07 PM, S Drag-teine wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t want my son<br/>\n&gt; (five and half) to be able to choose to watch whatever he wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you fear he&#39;ll choose?
