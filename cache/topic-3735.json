She knows a fun song that rhymes. <br/>\nLater it<br/>\nwill be relevant as to being the alphabet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree with everything Michelle said, but I wanted to <br/>\nadd that besides the fact that she knows a fun song that rhymes, <br/>\n(rather than the alphabet), she also knows that song because she was <br/>\nready.<br/>\nI could have sung the alphabet song everyday to Jalen as a baby and <br/>\nhe would NOT have learned it at age 1.5. Every child is so <br/>\ndifferent....she learned the song by being exposed and because she <br/>\nwas ready to learn it.<br/>\nJalen didn&#39;t speak much at all until age 3, he didn&#39;t like being <br/>\nsung to even as an infant, so singing any kind of song wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto happen regardless.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren DO pick up what they are surrounded by, to some degree, <br/>\nthat is true. Some will read at 3y.o., some at 12y.o.....when <br/>\nthey&#39;re 20y.o., will it matter one whit? Nope.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3730,"nextTopicId":3740}}
