My goal, in fact, IS to be their <br/>\n&quot;buddy&quot; - we&#39;ll live together as parent and child for such a few short <br/>\nyears - after that we&#39;ll ALL be adults. My sisters and I were so close <br/>\nto our mom - the older we got, the more we were better and better <br/>\n&quot;buddies.&quot; Grown kids and their parents can have the deepest most <br/>\nwonderful friendships - adult to adult friendships - possible. And that <br/>\nstarts developing in childhood - it doesn&#39;t just spring into being on <br/>\ntheir 18th birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And Mom is doing this with ruptured discs, spinal stenosis, nerve root<br/>\n&gt; compressions, and torn ligaments and epilepsy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And a serious case of &quot;martyrdom&quot; as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; What they&#39;re learning is that, as an adult,  you have NO<br/>\n&gt;&gt; responsibilities----especially of you can make someone else do<br/>\n&gt;&gt; everything for you!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What they are learning is that, as a Mother, it is also Moms <br/>\n&gt; responsibility<br/>\n&gt; to teach her children the domestic and life skill they need in order to<br/>\n&gt; become productive adults,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m 53 years old and I live a GREAT life and I don&#39;t know how to do <br/>\nANYTHING on your list and I have no interest in any of them, either.<br/>\nAre you assuming your kids&#39; choices will be the same as yours? Are you <br/>\ntrying to make sure of that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t rocket science to wash dishes and do laundry and dust and <br/>\nvacuum.

I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t really mean <br/>\n&quot;condescending&quot; since that insult didn&#39;t even make sense - <br/>\ncondescending means to lower yourself to somebody else&#39;s level or to <br/>\nspeak in a patronizingly superior tone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And they are also<br/>\n&gt; learning how to delegate.

You probably won&#39;t read more and with an <br/>\nopen enough mind to catch on, but you&#39;ve missed some big huge critical <br/>\npart of what people here are talking about AND you&#39;ve missed it that <br/>\npeople here have kids who are VOLUNTARILY helpful and who learn all <br/>\nkinds of things without anybody making them do it. I know these people <br/>\nand their kids and you don&#39;t - so I can understand skepticism, but <br/>\nyou&#39;re here on this list with people who are living a pretty extreme <br/>\nalternative lifestyle -- instead of insisting on your ways, which are <br/>\ntotally conventional parenting methods, same advice we&#39;ve all read a <br/>\nmillion times in parenting books and magazines, you might want to just <br/>\nbe quiet and read for understanding - maybe challenge yourself to try <br/>\nto figure out how it is that people who do NOT do what you think is <br/>\nessential do NOT end up with those &quot;condescending slugs&quot; but end up <br/>\nwith energetic, responsible, kind, competent and capable, and <br/>\neager-to-learn more grown kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I&#39;m thinking of getting t-shirts that say &quot;SLUG&quot; for <br/>\nmy kids - my kids are so NOT sluggish that people would consider it a <br/>\ngreat joke.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So once again, it&#39;s left up to the government to create organizations <br/>\n&gt; to do<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;parenting&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who are you talking to? People here don&#39;t have kids who are being <br/>\nparented by the government.

It is VERY far from having no principles <br/>\nto live by, in fact.
