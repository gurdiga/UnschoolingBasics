But Karen,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-84023652\">I have been searching the archives, but my computer is very slow, and I can&#39;t remember the thread, so please forgive me for an inexact quote.  But Karen, months ago you made a statement something like, &quot;Be careful in answering their questions.&quot;  I didn&#39;t ask you to expound at that time, because I thought I knew what you meant (I was thinking you meant to be sure I knew what he was really asking and not to give too much info).  But this statement has been haunting me for some time now.  Will is asking me hundreds of questions every day....this morning we have already had, among others, &quot;What is the law?&quot; &quot;What is liquid?&quot; &quot;What does I love you mean?&quot; and &quot;Why does males have nipples if they can&#39;t make milk?&quot;   I am getting hit with some hard stuff to explain.  And sometimes I probably don&#39;t do a great job....for example, on the male nipple question, all I could think to say was that just like everyone has a nose and eyes, everyone has nipples.  And he was like, &quot;but what is they for?&quot;<br/>\n  I was stumped and said &quot;I guess they are just decorative,&quot; and I felt that he was so unsatisfied w this answer.   <br/>\nAnyway, like I said, your warning on this keeps popping into my mind and I was wondering if you would explain further.....<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMillie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
