Laurie was terrified of math because &quot;everyone&quot; <br/>\nasked &quot;What about math?&quot; Even her schooled peers would tell her at <br/>\nevery opportunity that she was stupid for not knowing math. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust imagine telling people in the early 80&#39;s that you <br/>\naren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; traditional subjects to your daughter. Laurie <br/>\nheard a million times, &quot;But what about math?&quot; At the homeschool <br/>\nmeeting where I spoke, I was shot down in my speaking by the VERY <br/>\nhostile question &quot;You mean you aren&#39;t teaching her MATH?&quot; She began <br/>\nto think of math as some huge obstacle that she had to conquer, <br/>\nregardless of how many times I told her that she&#39;d learn it when SHE <br/>\nneeded it. But remember, I was the ONLY person in her life that <br/>\nbelieved she would learn what she needed when she needed it; <br/>\neveryone else pushed at each opportunity. She hated being around <br/>\ncertain people because it never failed that they would ask her a <br/>\nmath question. I stopped them each time, but they were agonizingly <br/>\npersistent. After a few times, I broke off our friendship; they <br/>\nignored my request to stop testing her. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe math question created self-doubt for her and it turned into a <br/>\nmath phobia for awhile. She asked me a few times to sit at the table <br/>\nand Teach her some math, but after only a few minutes, she was angry <br/>\nand put a halt to it. I never pushed of course. She pretty much <br/>\nconvinced herself that she Couldn&#39;t learn math. Imagine how many <br/>\ntimes that happens with schooled children! <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she let go of the fear and basically said &quot;F*** it! I have <br/>\nother things to do,&quot; she forgot all about &quot;learning&quot; math and just <br/>\nstarted enjoying games where math was required to get to the next <br/>\nlevel. Once she got to college math classes, she was more secure <br/>\nabout who she was, whether or not she was a &quot;math&quot; person, and it <br/>\nmade the learning just happen. After a few remedial classes, college <br/>\nalgebra was easy for her. I reverted back to my mindset from <br/>\nhighschool where my dad said things like, &quot;I don&#39;t understand WHY <br/>\nyou can&#39;t get algebra; you were reading U.S.News and World Report at <br/>\nage 5.&quot; Huh? Pressure from my looooooong ago past concerning Algebra <br/>\ncreated a mind block for me 25+ years later and I dropped the class. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I say she feared math. She&#39;d have nightmares about it and <br/>\nfret over being math illiterate forever. Now she wants to be a <br/>\nstatistician. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore <br/>\nGenovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@w...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Valerie,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just finished your book and I really enjoyed it - it gave me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>such a great<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; perspective that I am walking around today feeling so energized and<br/>\n&gt; re-focused on my children.
