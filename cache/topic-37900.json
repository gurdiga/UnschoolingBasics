It&#39;s just what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re stuck with. They&#39;re stuck with a system that makes kids jump  <br/>\nthrough hoops to create transcripts. They need a way to sort out  <br/>\nwho&#39;s likely to fit in with who&#39;s likely to not make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany colleges are moving away from the SATs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat colleges *really* want to see are applicants who know what they  <br/>\nwant to do and have demonstrated that they are capable of learning  <br/>\nmore. Colleges love older students who&#39;ve been out in the world  <br/>\nbecause they&#39;re more focused and know what they want rather than 17  <br/>\nyear olds who&#39;ve been hoop jumping for 12 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids have the opportunity to look *better* than schooled  <br/>\nkids because they&#39;re different. They&#39;re more focused like people  <br/>\nwho&#39;ve been out in the work force. Don&#39;t try to make her look like a  <br/>\npoor copy of a schooled kid! Help her show how she shines in unique  <br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the lower tier colleges are likely to be confused by  <br/>\nunschoolers ;-) They don&#39;t see applications outside of the norm and  <br/>\nreally don&#39;t know what to do with them. You can, of course, take the  <br/>\nbull by the horns and help them see how she&#39;s better.
