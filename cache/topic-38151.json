This is<br/>\ndefinitely giving me clarity! My son _is_ happy, specially when I<br/>\ndon&#39;t try to make him do &#39;schooly&#39; things.(He is 12, BTW.) The<br/>\n&#39;concrete learning&#39; is, in my eyes still school related, and<br/>\nunfortunately  in the family&#39;s eyes, too.  But I can let go of that,<br/>\nspecially with the help of people like you guys!  The family will just<br/>\nhave to put up with it, I guess. And I will have top put up with<br/>\nthem!! (eg. one member told me that children should be made to do<br/>\nthings they don&#39;t like because it builds character!!) Unfortunately, I<br/>\nlive way too far away from any Unschooling conferences- in South<br/>\nAfrica.  There are a few unschoolers down here, and they are<br/>\nwonderful, supportive people, too.  Just fairly few and far between!<br/>\nWhen I look at the things you suggest he may have learned, I see that<br/>\nhe is progressing every day- just not in the way our family expects<br/>\nhim to! So thank you for your helpful responses. I think I just have<br/>\nto get MY mind right now! It is improving already!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130027733,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: help, I have regressed","postDate":"1233428208","msgId":38154,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdtMjZ0Zys5aG5jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDkwMTMxMTAwMzA3LndqaW5hbjl6YzRvODRjd2NAd2VibWFpbC5sb2NhbG5ldC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38151,"nextInTopic":38166,"prevInTime":38153,"nextInTime":38155,"topicId":38151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
