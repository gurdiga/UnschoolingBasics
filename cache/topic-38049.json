Most of these people have gone to school and the vast majority<br/>\nhave graduated high school. The writing is often horrible. In fact the<br/>\npeople who are not English as a first language writers are ALL better<br/>\nspellers and writers then the English as a first language people. Most<br/>\nthe younger people can&#39;t even be bothered to type full words like you<br/>\nprefering u instead yet few of them understand the U R N X song........<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This tells me that 1. you can get along in the real world just fine<br/>\n </span></blockquote>without good English skills should you so choose. After all from what<br/>\nI have seen a good 75 to 80% of high school graduates have the same or<br/>\nworse spelling skills as my my oldest when we took her out of the 4th<br/>\ngrade. 2. Schools are doing a horrifying job of teaching children<br/>\nspelling. 3. learning English because you want to communicate with<br/>\nother like minded people produces people who have excellent spelling<br/>\nand grammar.  At least from what I have seen. 4. they might be giants<br/>\nsings about everything! I love them they are like a main educational<br/>\nstaple in our house. 5. those who love language have the best spelling<br/>\nand writing. 6. most people who graduated highschool hate the english<br/>\nlanguage or just dont care. I know I hated the english language by then. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; In fact this list has far better spelling and grammer then most<br/>\n </span></blockquote>lists I have been on and no one crusifys anyone for it like they do in<br/>\nmany other places. So my point is they will learn spelling and  good<br/>\nwriting by spelling and writing and reading and caring about what they<br/>\nwrite. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There are TONS of writing resources out there now days.

How it happens hinges on the fact that there are many ways to <br/>\nlearn things.

But all the while their self esteem is a shambles. <br/>\nHelping them see what and how they&#39;ve learned over the years is an <br/>\nimportant part of helping them learn to read using their own, very <br/>\nreal skills and strategies. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis ties back in to unschooling. Kids who have struggled with school <br/>\nin the past have the same damage to their self confidence. They may <br/>\nneed a lot of reassurance and help seeing where their strengths lie. <br/>\nKids who have been unschooled from an early age, but don&#39;t read until <br/>\nthey&#39;re older may need a lot of moral support from parents - because <br/>\nthey can run into the same messages from schooled friends and <br/>\nrelatives that not-reading means something is wrong with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks for the great info on this group!","postDate":"1232772480","msgId":38101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyNDU3Ni43NjQyOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDUyMjYwNi43MTM0NC5xbUB3ZWI1OTIwNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38100,"nextInTopic":38105,"prevInTime":38100,"nextInTime":38102,"topicId":38049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do not have TV (no cable/Sat dish..)

From a radical unschooling perspective, its <br/>\nimportant to share this kind of information the same way you&#39;d do it <br/>\nwith an adult friend, with the understanding that they&#39;ll take it or <br/>\nleave it. Different people learn and remember and process <br/>\ndifferently, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis next is going to sound nit-picky, so bear with me a little. <br/>\nUnschooling is all about the relationships your foster with your kids:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; one strategy that works for us is to have the child close their <br/>\n </span></blockquote>eyes...<br/>\n***************<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t find it helpful to &quot;have&quot; my kids do things. I&#39;m older, sure, <br/>\nand have more experience, but its *my* experience of the way my brain <br/>\nand body work and my life has unfolded. However much my kids are like <br/>\nme, they aren&#39;t me. They&#39;re going to do and learn and experience <br/>\nthings their own ways. I put a lot of time and energy into observing <br/>\nmy kids and trying to understand how they go about doing and learning <br/>\nand experiencing, but when all&#39;s said and sifted, I can never be the <br/>\nexpert on them that they can be. That&#39;s one of my goals as an <br/>\nunschooling parent - to help my kids to be their own best experts on <br/>\nthemselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I offer one of my kids a strategy, its an offer. Its something <br/>\nthey can try if they want, maybe never, maybe later. Ray, in <br/>\nparticular, hates to try something new with an audience. He&#39;ll go off <br/>\non his own to try something the first couple times. Years ago, when <br/>\nwe were homeschooling, I&#39;d coax him to trying whatever (close your <br/>\neyes and imagine, for example) right there in front of me. It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nhelpful to him. He&#39;d get all wound up in &quot;having&quot; to do it, and that <br/>\nwas all he&#39;d get out of the experience - that he Had to. He&#39;d Agree <br/>\nwith me that it was helpful, but then again, he thought that was <br/>\nsomething he &quot;had&quot; to do, too. Learning not to coax helped our <br/>\nrelationship enormously. As our relationship improved, he started to <br/>\nfeel comfortable enough to try some of my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese days, if Ray wants a suggestion, he&#39;ll ask for it. He and I <br/>\nboth know that he&#39;s more likely to find what works for Him without <br/>\ntoo much of my help. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":293322409,"authorName":"Deanne Liner","from":"Deanne Liner &lt;ohwhatacruise@...&gt;","profile":"ohwhatacruise","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks for the great info on this group!","postDate":"1232753812","msgId":38096,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyMjYwNi43MTM0NC5xbUB3ZWI1OTIwNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38095,"nextInTopic":38097,"prevInTime":38095,"nextInTime":38097,"topicId":38049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I do not have TV (no cable/Sat dish..)

I guess I am doing OK with him afterall. He is constantly amazing me with things he finds on the internet too. He printed the Cotton Bowl Football team info today..Funbrain.com<br/>\n is his favorite site. I just need to observe him more and worry less I would say.

Most of these people have gone to school and the vast majority have graduated high school. The writing is often horrible. In fact the people who are not English as a first language writers are ALL better spellers and writers then the English as a first language people. Most the younger people can&#39;t even be bothered to type full words like you prefering u instead yet few of them understand the U R N X song........<br/>\n<br/>\nThis tells me that 1. you can get along in the real world just fine without good English skills should you so choose. After all from what I have seen a good 75 to 80% of high school graduates have the same or worse spelling skills as my my oldest when we took her out of the 4th grade. 2. Schools are doing a horrifying job of teaching children spelling. 3. learning English because you want to communicate with other like minded people produces people who have excellent spelling and grammar.  At least from what I have seen. 4. they might be giants sings about everything! I love them they are like a main educational staple in our house. 5. those who love language have the best spelling and writing. 6. most people who graduated highschool hate the english language or just dont care. I know I hated the english language by then. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact this list has far better spelling and grammer then most lists I have been on and no one crusifys anyone for it like they do in many other places. So my point is they will learn spelling and  good writing by spelling and writing and reading and caring about what they write. <br/>\nThere are TONS of writing resources out there now days. I love the between the lions show. All sorts of games that involve writing and reading and games where you find the words or unscramble them or have to figure out the order they are suppose to be in are found in tons of video games. There is also boggle and jr boggle and cross words and word searches and book writing contests and pen pals and lists for the store and notes passed under doors and poetry contests and diaries or journals and blogs and forums and chatting and books and the list goes on and on and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know that a % of highschool graduates can&#39;t read? I frankly am compleatly shocked that there are highschool graduates who can&#39;t read I mean they had 18 years of reading and writing shoved down their throats and it did not take.... I mean seriously how do you get to be an adult without being able to  read on at least a minimal level  much less graduate highchool; societies end all be all of edumacation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks for the great info on this group!","postDate":"1232740576","msgId":38087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFDMDBEMDU1LTM3MDctNDhCRC1BMTBBLTM1MkZFMzYyODY1M0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMTI3NDk1LThGQTMtNDNDRC1BMEEyLTBBRUY5MkRCQTBGQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGdsYjNldCsxMGJmMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDAxMTI3NDk1LThGQTMtNDNDRC1BMEEyLTBBRUY5MkRCQTBGQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":38084,"nextInTopic":38091,"prevInTime":38086,"nextInTime":38088,"topicId":38049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The characters in West Wing are like our good friends - Josh,  <br/>\nDonna, Toby, Sam, .... all are our buddies! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this election started up, my kids already knew so much about  <br/>\npolitics from watching West Wing that they could easily get caught up  <br/>\nin the election process. They watched all the debates and analyzed  <br/>\nthem. Also watched The Daily Show and The Colbert Report and Saturday  <br/>\nNight Live and other comedy and talk shows - got all the jokes because  <br/>\nthey were keeping up with the election coverage. Rosie volunteered to  <br/>\nwork as a poll worker - went to a long training - learned everything  <br/>\nabout how the voting is actually carried out and worked from 6 am to 9  <br/>\npm at a polling place on election day. They also got interested in all  <br/>\nthe propositions. My kids have a lot of gay friends and they were  <br/>\nstrongly against the California Proposition 8 anti-gay marriage  <br/>\ncampaign - got involved in that and came to understand the proposition  <br/>\nsystem we have in California and also how the court had made same-sex  <br/>\nmarriage legal, etc. When Obama began announcing his cabinet  <br/>\nappointments, they followed that closely and looked up information on  <br/>\nmany of them - mostly to make fascinating comparisons to characters on  <br/>\nWest Wing! &lt;G&gt; Rosie is especially interested in politics and she  <br/>\ndecided to take a Political Science course at the community college  <br/>\nthis semester. Just for fun. (But, oh the irony!!! She was IN her  <br/>\npolitical science class when Obama was being inaugurated and they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t watch it in class - too much to cover, couldn&#39;t take the time  <br/>\nfrom the scheduled lectures. Aargh.) The way the Obama campaign used  <br/>\nthe internet really helped inform and draw in young people - the  <br/>\ncampaign was absolutely masterful at providing just the right amount  <br/>\nof information in a format that really worked for the teens and young  <br/>\nadults.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need to be taught about government and politics, these days  <br/>\nespecially!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all kids are going to be super interested, though - some will pick  <br/>\nup the basic idea and be satisfied with that. That&#39;s okay, too. Better  <br/>\nthat they should be supported and encouraged to pursue their own  <br/>\nnatural interests than be forced to learn about something that doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ninterest them much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout geography - this is not something that is well-suited to  <br/>\nlearning from books, anyway. In terms of creating a rich and  <br/>\nstimulating environment - having maps and a globe around is a really  <br/>\ngood idea. We&#39;ve always had a globe sitting around the living room and  <br/>\nwe&#39;ve had various maps taped up to walls and doors - different ones  <br/>\nover the years. Also, be a curious person - when you&#39;re watching tv  <br/>\nand someone mentions a place, you can wonder aloud, &quot;Where IS that?&quot;  <br/>\nand grab the globe (or google if you&#39;re sitting with your laptop as we  <br/>\nusually are). Lots of times somebody googles something and scan  <br/>\nquickly and maybe toss out a tidbit of some interesting factoid about  <br/>\nthe place. &quot;Did you know that...?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, in today&#39;s small world, geography is easy to &quot;just pick up&quot;  <br/>\nnaturally, given that parents are interested and interesting (love  <br/>\nthat expression).

The third had in  <br/>\ninteresting, but not terribly uncommon, problem with spelling. She  <br/>\ncould read well and read a lot, but she couldn&#39;t spell even simple  <br/>\nwords. She would, for example, write &quot;TEH&quot; or &quot;HTE&quot; or &quot;EHT&quot; or &quot;THE&quot;  <br/>\nall equally often for the word &quot;THE.&quot; In one sentence she might write  <br/>\nit two different ways. Sometimes she would add letters. So she might  <br/>\nwrite &quot;TNEH&quot; for &quot;THE.&quot; What she wrote was very often completely  <br/>\nunreadable - even she couldn&#39;t read what she&#39;d written. She was  <br/>\nfrustrated by it - she was a voracious reader and both of her older  <br/>\nsisters were writers and she wanted to write, too. I read a little  <br/>\nbook called something like &quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell&quot; - it gave ideas for  <br/>\ncoping with not being good at spelling. As I gave her various ideas to  <br/>\ndeal with it, we noticed that she could recognize the correctly  <br/>\nspelled word in a list, even though she couldn&#39;t come up with it on  <br/>\nher own. So if I gave her a list: &quot;TEH&quot; &quot;HTE&quot; &quot;THE&quot; - she could  <br/>\nquickly say which one was correct. She knew it when she saw it  <br/>\nwritten. Reading up on it, I came to realize that she had a little  <br/>\nmissing step in her brain processing - she didn&#39;t &quot;visualize&quot; the word  <br/>\non the blackboard of her brain before writing it down. She just  <br/>\nremembered which letters were in the word. This was especially  <br/>\ninteresting since she had learned to read in a way that was very  <br/>\ndifferent than my other kids - she&#39;d memorized lots and lots of words,  <br/>\nrecognized the entire word, did not sound out words at all for a very  <br/>\nlong time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere wasn&#39;t anything much she could do about it. This was her brain&#39;s  <br/>\nway of working. She used various coping strategies - lots of asking  <br/>\nsomeone &quot;How do you spell....&quot; and lots of times she&#39;d write a word in  <br/>\nas many ways as she could think of, then look at her own list and  <br/>\ndiscover she&#39;d included the correct one in the list. But, it was sort  <br/>\nof slow and annoying and it held her back from writing, which she  <br/>\nreally wanted to do. She was frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she was a young teenager and started IMing with friends online a  <br/>\nlot. I know there was a period of a little frustration when her  <br/>\nfriends couldn&#39;t read what she wrote. They&#39;d respond, &quot;Huh?&quot; and she&#39;d  <br/>\nrewrite. But she was lucky enough to have a lot of online unschooled/ <br/>\nhomeschooled very tolerant friends. Nobody made fun of her, nobody  <br/>\neven commented on her poor spelling. They didn&#39;t think less of her. It  <br/>\nwas just &quot;her.&quot; And, lo and behold, over a few years her spelling  <br/>\nimproved. That was, to be honest, a bit unexpected - I&#39;d come to  <br/>\nbelieve she had a &quot;spelling disability&quot; that wasn&#39;t going to go away.  <br/>\nI hadn&#39;t told her that - we&#39;d just treated it like anything else -  <br/>\nsomething that she hadn&#39;t developed into yet. I commiserated with her  <br/>\nin her frustration and helped her cope, but &quot;I&quot; secretly had thought  <br/>\nshe probably wouldn&#39;t ever get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy, was I wrong. She did get it, in her own way and in her own time.  <br/>\nBy 16 years old she was doing pretty well at spelling. She&#39;ll be 18  <br/>\nnext week and she&#39;s a fantastic speller - no problems at all even with  <br/>\nquite complicated words.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s written several novels and screenplays (NaNoWriMo and  <br/>\nScriptFrenzy) and she&#39;s in college and writes papers in and out of  <br/>\nclass.

To be there for her to<br/>\nhelp her spell words and show her how to make her writing make sense to<br/>\nother people. One day she wanted an editor so she asked her papa. They<br/>\nresearched all the special code you write on manuscripts and he corrected<br/>\nher writing (at her behest). They talked about grammar and punctuation and<br/>\ncoherency. They talked for days on and off. She learned years worth of<br/>\nschool &quot;language arts&quot; in a few conversations over a couple days when *she*<br/>\nwas ready for it. She sucked the information right up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for geography, her and two friends (11 and 12) are planning their first<br/>\ncross country road trip for when they can drive. they are frequently on the<br/>\ninternet together planning their journey.

They have researched each stated<br/>\nindividually to discover what might be interesting in each state and where<br/>\nit is in relation to the other areas of interest. They are passionate about<br/>\nit. It is what they talk about. Also my daughter has been to every state<br/>\neast of the Mississippi river (and to the Mississippi river).

She isn&#39;t hung up about learning about<br/>\nthe US, she just wants to travel and see things. They have begun discussing<br/>\nEuropean and African travel as well..

When they need to know how to spell a word, they ask me. I tell them how to spell it. Sometimes, they use spell-check. Duncan, 12, seems to be making all sorts of spelling connections lately.

We&#39;ve all been to NM and AZ (Grand Canyon). He&#39;s been---withOUT us to Australia, Scotland & England, the Yukon, and Mexico. He&#39;s heading to CA this August to backpack. None of us has been to Ohio...yet. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;re leaving next Sunday for a week there.

By 14, he had been to half the African ones, and all the European ones. It wasn&#39;t that he could &quot;recite&quot; the capitals---although he *could*---it was that he had BEEN there: he&#39;d smelled, touched, tasted them.

The problems aren&#39;t natural.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re created by school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of kids who weren&#39;t reading by &quot;4th grade&quot; who, by the  <br/>\ntime they leave home, are reading in a way that&#39;s indistinguishable  <br/>\nfrom unschooled kids who read at 6. When reading kicks in, kids are  <br/>\nfairly quickly reading at age level. No lessons. No required reading.  <br/>\nAll it takes is reading to them when they want, answering questions,  <br/>\nhaving things they want to read around them, living in a print rich  <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I also put him in a Homeschool Co Op on Weds 9-12 where<br/>\n&gt; he takes spanish, science and art classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you put him.

In terms of all  <br/>\nadults, it&#39;s most every adult who went through school and managed to  <br/>\nconvince  themselves that all that hard work had to be for some benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to let go of the old model. If you&#39;ve only known  <br/>\n&quot;swimming&quot; by holding onto the side and touching bottom, then letting  <br/>\ngo in the deep water will seem like an impossibility. The only skills  <br/>\nyou have are hold on and touch bottom which are useless away from the  <br/>\nsides and the bottom! Unschooling is letting go of the sides and  <br/>\nbottom. It takes a while to figure out what to put in place of those  <br/>\ntwo. And for a while nothing you do feels as right or comforting. It  <br/>\nfeels like you&#39;re about to drown! But once you catch on to what we do  <br/>\ninstead of instruction and workbooks, then you&#39;ll understand. :-) It  <br/>\nwill be and feel more natural -- and more interesting! -- than  <br/>\nholding onto the sides and standing in the water.

What they do know is  <br/>\nthat in the artificial world of school where educators need kids to  <br/>\nread independently by 4th grade, that an 8 yo who is not reading &quot;up  <br/>\nto speed&quot; is going to have problems. The problems aren&#39;t natural.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re created by school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of kids who weren&#39;t reading by &quot;4th grade&quot; who, by the  <br/>\ntime they leave home, are reading in a way that&#39;s indistinguishable  <br/>\nfrom unschooled kids who read at 6. When reading kicks in, kids are  <br/>\nfairly quickly reading at age level. No lessons. No required reading.  <br/>\nAll it takes is reading to them when they want, answering questions,  <br/>\nhaving things they want to read around them, living in a print rich  <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also put him in a Homeschool Co Op on Weds 9-12 where<br/>\n&gt; he takes spanish, science and art classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You say you put him. Are these classes that he freely chose? Could he  <br/>\nhave said no thanks? Could he have chosen to take no classes if none  <br/>\nappealed to him? Could he drop out if they weren&#39;t meeting what he  <br/>\nfelt *his* needs are?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, think about how much you&#39;d get out of a class on Medieval  <br/>\nTurkish Law if your husband made you go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just want to know if I am<br/>\n&gt; doing enough to insure he is actually learning and not just hanging<br/>\n&gt; out all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the &quot;hanging out&quot; where his most profound learning will happen.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re actually interfering with the learning that&#39;s natural to  <br/>\nhumans by imposing processes that ease your fears but are very  <br/>\ninefficient ways to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy &quot;hanging out&quot; I don&#39;t mean releasing him into the house and  <br/>\nletting him amuse himself. I mean stepping back when he&#39;s involved,  <br/>\nrunning interesting things through his life, getting enough involved  <br/>\nin the things he&#39;s interested in to have conversations about them,  <br/>\nhelping him explore his interests even further with related items  <br/>\n(but let him be the judge of how much or how deep or even if).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe it is just me? I just sort of feel he needs<br/>\n&gt; spelling and math workbooks or something.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In terms of the two of you, yes, it&#39;s just you. In terms of all  <br/>\nadults, it&#39;s most every adult who went through school and managed to  <br/>\nconvince  themselves that all that hard work had to be for some benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to let go of the old model. If you&#39;ve only known  <br/>\n&quot;swimming&quot; by holding onto the side and touching bottom, then letting  <br/>\ngo in the deep water will seem like an impossibility. The only skills  <br/>\nyou have are hold on and touch bottom which are useless away from the  <br/>\nsides and the bottom! Unschooling is letting go of the sides and  <br/>\nbottom. It takes a while to figure out what to put in place of those  <br/>\ntwo. And for a while nothing you do feels as right or comforting. It  <br/>\nfeels like you&#39;re about to drown! But once you catch on to what we do  <br/>\ninstead of instruction and workbooks, then you&#39;ll understand. :-) It  <br/>\nwill be and feel more natural -- and more interesting! -- than  <br/>\nholding onto the sides and standing in the water. But like swimming,  <br/>\nit&#39;s something that is best understood by seeing it done successfully  <br/>\nand -- even more importantly -- by doing it yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead the archives here.

I learned more about spelling as an adult with spell check than as a kid with a dictionary! I hated hearing &quot;look it up&quot; when I&#39;d ask how to spell something. How can you look it up if you don&#39;t know how to spell it? I do algebra because I like it but honestly most adults never use it. I have even spoken to adults who can&#39;t balance a checkbook but were &quot;educated&quot;. Unschooling is great because it accepts that we all have different strengths and interests. I&#39;m a KOOK (Keeper Of Odd Knowledge) and read Shakespeare at 11 by choice but freaked out because my car was running hot (it was totally dry!) and if you ask me knowing about cars is much more useful than knowing cursive, algebra, spelling and that Istanbul was Constantinople... \r<br/>\nSent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: Heather & Markus Schleidt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hmschleidt@...\">hmschleidt@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDate: Thu, 22 Jan 2009 21:34:05 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks for the great info on this group!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nPart of the issue here is of course, which state you live in and whether they require you to &quot;log&quot; your hours or not.

I took my son out of public school at the end of last school<br/>\nyear, I just signed him up as a homeschooler this year. Well Fast<br/>\nForward we are not doing much &quot;school&quot; work but he is enjoying being a<br/>\nboy and I enjoy his company. My friends are homeschoolers who keep<br/>\nreminding me that the LAW says you have to do 4 hours of school work<br/>\nbla bla bla..My son is in Special Ed in school for learning<br/>\ndisablities..Well he is smarter than any 8 yr old I have ever met in<br/>\nmany ways. He is however not able to sit in a desk all day long and<br/>\nfollow orders. So he is home with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question to those in this group. How do you insure your child can<br/>\nSPELL correctly, knows govt and geography if you do not do much in a<br/>\nbook? I take my son to reading tutoring at a local College and speech<br/>\ntherapy there also. So 4 days he has an hour of 1 on 1 instruction and<br/>\nhe loves that. I also put him in a Homeschool Co Op on Weds 9-12 where<br/>\nhe takes spanish, science and art classes. I just want to know if I am<br/>\ndoing enough to insure he is actually learning and not just hanging<br/>\nout all the time. Maybe it is just me?
