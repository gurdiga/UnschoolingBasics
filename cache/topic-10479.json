Are there really any or is it just our &quot;schooled&quot;<br/>\n&gt; perspective of it? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lesa <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> *******We&#39;ve only been homeschooling for a little over a year now. (2 dd&#39;s <br/>\n11 & 12 yo) We decided to just DEschool for a while and then, the more I read <br/>\nand the more we saw for ourselves, meaning, just living life as unschoolers, <br/>\nthe more we realized how much this life works for us. Although I do believe we <br/>\nare still somewhat deschooling, unschooling is working it&#39;s way into our lives <br/>\nwonderfully. I can&#39;t think of any &quot;stresses&quot; I, my dh or even our kids have <br/>\nfrom unschooling. We have normal every day stresses just as anyone else would <br/>\nbut I think with unschooling there is way less stress for us. When our girls <br/>\nwere in school there were plenty of stresses! They were always tired, stressed, <br/>\nfrustrated, rushed, worried about getting the grade & pleasing everyone they <br/>\nfelt they had to please in school, they were thirsty and hungry when they got <br/>\nhome and the social thing was TOTALLY over rated! Schools so called socializing <br/>\nwas full of stressful situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday we went to an open skate at the club they belong to (they&#39;re figure <br/>\nskaters) so they could practice their routine they have to do for the next level <br/>\nthey are working on, we were the ONLY ONES on the ice! We had the place to <br/>\nourselves! No stresses there either! :o) I really can&#39;t think of anything <br/>\nstressful from unschooling, except for, like you mentioned, when someone sticks their <br/>\nnose into things, if it&#39;s in an unpleasant manner that is. When that happens <br/>\nI think we&#39;re all getting a little better at trying to respond in a positive <br/>\nway. My kids are so much more at peace with themselves than from when they were <br/>\nin school. If anything, it has made life so much more stress free! They love <br/>\nunschooling and are happier doing so, there is no way that could bring more <br/>\nstress to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10419,"nextTopicId":10470}}
