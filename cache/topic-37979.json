My <br/>\nkids are often more ready for whatever they&#39;re doing than *I* am ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also found that my kids do best in social situations when I&#39;m <br/>\nright there, backing them up. Adults tend to be really grossly <br/>\nobnoxious to kids and it helps a ton to have another adult <br/>\nsaying &quot;hey, that&#39;s not called for.&quot; Other kids... how do I put this? <br/>\nI tend not to &quot;dump&quot; my kids in social situations they aren&#39;t ready <br/>\nto handle. I&#39;m there supporting them. I mean Right There - preferably <br/>\nwhere I can see and hear what&#39;s going on. Since both my kids have <br/>\ncome to trust that I will back them up, and help them find solutions <br/>\nto problems, they&#39;re both happy to come to me for help solving <br/>\nproblems. So, over time, there are more and more situations where <br/>\nthey say &quot;It&#39;s okay, Mer!&quot; Nowadays if my 15yo says he&#39;s fine, he&#39;s <br/>\nfine. He&#39;ll leave if he&#39;s not happy in the situation - he&#39;s walked <br/>\nmiles to get away from a conflict and walked out of parties bc he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t trust the scene. I&#39;ve seen him, at the skatepark, plant <br/>\nhimself firmly behind the one adult skater when tempers started to <br/>\nheat up between the other teens. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;      Don&#39;t praise them indiscriminately<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t praise my kids. I say &quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;I really appreciated <br/>\nthat&quot; and &quot;OMG that was sooooo Cool!&quot; in the same way I would say <br/>\nthose things to a friend.
