Last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-804063953\">&quot;But not since she has<br/>\ndiscovered the use of TV as distraction. And I really think that is <br/>\npart of<br/>\nwhat we have to do... reinstate those limits on TV. Last night as we<br/>\nprepared thanksgiving dinner and all the adults were busy, she wanted<br/>\nsomeone to play with her. So I suggested she watch a show (30 <br/>\nminutes) while<br/>\nshe wait for dinner and she said, no that is too boring.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m confused Sherri.<br/>\nYou say you need to reinstate limits when she isn&#39;t even that <br/>\ninterested in it anyway? How are limits going to help?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest shift right now is in how you see her. I get the <br/>\nfeeling that your embarrassment over how she&#39;s acted some of the <br/>\ntime (in front of family..am I right?) has caused you to see her <br/>\nas &quot;less than&quot;. You used words like obnoxious, rude etc....which <br/>\ntells me a lot.<br/>\nShe knows you feel angst towards her. If her Mum doesn&#39;t see her as <br/>\nperfect, whole and incredible at each moment, she IS going to react <br/>\nbadly. I know how frustrating it can be, believe me...I have a very <br/>\nintense child that makes me want to run up the street screaming some <br/>\ndays. But I remember that whatever he is doing to make us nuts, is a <br/>\nsignal of some kind. <br/>\nWhen a child is acting in ways that aren&#39;t appropriate, and coaching <br/>\nisn&#39;t working, we need to remember that they truly WANT to please <br/>\nthe adults in their lives and try to figure the reasons behind the <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Mom that is too tired to get up and fix food (even after saying <br/>\nshe&#39;s tired) isn&#39;t common for her probably! I would hope that <br/>\nnormally, a four year old changing their minds wouldn&#39;t be seen as <br/>\ncontrary, but normal four year old behavior. You&#39;re not normally <br/>\nhugely pregnant...this is different for her, and NOT easy. Try to <br/>\nunderstand that however hard the pregnancy is for you, it&#39;s harder <br/>\nfor her in many ways because she doesn&#39;t have maturity and <br/>\nexperience on her side. An extra dose of understanding for her <br/>\ntypical four year old behavior will go a long ways right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to watch the phrases you use when seeing her act up. Drop words <br/>\nlike &quot;rude/obnoxious&quot; etc... and see a child that is frustrated, <br/>\nlost, unable to cope etc...<br/>\nIf she knows that she SHINES (to borrow AnneO&#39;s term) in your eyes, <br/>\nit will help her cope. Her life is changing in big ways. Having a <br/>\nMum that&#39;s too tired to do a lot of things right now is hard on her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a hard time for you too...but she&#39;s only little once. Keep <br/>\ntreading gently. Reinstating limits and punishment are not the <br/>\nanswers...that will only do more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3536,"nextTopicId":3616}}
