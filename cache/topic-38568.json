I know they give nightmares to some kids (I was one of them, I wouldn&#39;t even watch Goonies). So I think taking it slow is a good plan. My son would lay on couch and fall asleep while I watched Buffy and Angel when he was 2-3. It never seemed to bother him.

I asked my dad about it once and he said that it was because they didn&#39;t like the idea of government censorship. They felt as my parents they could decide what was appropriate for me to see. I saw Tommy when I was too young to remember more than the Gypsy Queen and Woody Allen&#39;s Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex and was left with a vague, dream quality memory of a giant boob squirting milk at people. It was years before I saw that movie again and was able to source my memory. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t taken that approach with Simon and Linnaea. Because of the wonder of video and now dvd and blu-ray, I don&#39;t have to push them beyond their comfort zone with a movie. If they are curious about a movie that I might think is too much for them we can get it and sit together with the remote control in hand and stop it when it gets tense. I could even run through it first and tell them in advance what it is going to happen. We can watch things in the middle of the day with lights on and lots of other things to distract, not in a darkened cinema with a giant screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I notice if a movie is R-rated that much. I live in the<br/>\nUK and I think it&#39;s always age and not letter. Anyhow, 12 and over or 18<br/>\nseems more negotiable in my mind.  We have movies that are 18 and over, (is that X-rated?). Jeez, Woody Allen&#39;s Everything you always wanted to know about sex is 18 and over. Footloose is rated for 15 year olds and older. Hair is the same. Jeez, that really winds me up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea have never liked<br/>\nscary movies. Gore doesn&#39;t appeal. They don&#39;t seek out shows with sex<br/>\nin them, either. They like Austin Powers (which is rated 15 and over, so they couldn&#39;t see those in the cinema), they like Jack Black movies, they like Family Guy. Those are the kinds of films that they would want to watch that the age rating would exclude them from. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150989429,"authorName":"Jet Lakey","from":"Jet Lakey &lt;Jetlakey@...&gt;","profile":"wiccankungfu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] movies WAS  graphic novels","postDate":"1236026565","msgId":38693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEwNy1XNTkxQjg5OTNCNThBQTFCRDc0M0Y4QUNFQTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvaGY4ditvbGhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENPTDEwNy1XMzIzMzBEMUQ2RDU3NTNFRDJFNUYzRkNFQTkwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDxnb2hmOHYrb2xocEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38692,"nextInTopic":38697,"prevInTime":38692,"nextInTime":38694,"topicId":38568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i replied under the wrong thread! sorry. luckily at this point he does trust my judgement and he doesn t see it as me with holding stuff (believe me, if he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1247059237\">i replied under the wrong thread! sorry. luckily at this point he does trust my judgement and he doesn&#39;t see it as me with holding stuff (believe me, if he even thinks i am he will lay into me and it&#39;s &quot;up for discussion&quot;).

My friends teenages read them alot and have been writing their own for sometime now. So i haven&#39;t been spoon fed this info. it was just personal feeling and watching how my son and my nephew took to them. my son would read some to me and I would describe (via the words without looking at pics) what i thought the scene looked like. then my son would go off that it couldn&#39;t possibly be like that because the picture says its this way or that way. Granted my son also threw a major hissy fit when they down graded pluto and didn&#39;t bother to update books on time. we would have a discussion about it then he would go pull the &quot;universe&quot; book off the shelve, look up the part about pluto being a planet and tell me &quot;the book says so&quot;. too young to get that the book was outdate..thank goodness for internet!!&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nand my son will watch anything on discovery and history channel...no matter what it is. He might not like it and alot would give him nightmares. (the killing, starving, dead bodies etc). I usually just tell him he can&#39;t watch it because it was made for grown ups and when he&#39;s a bit older I will let him watch it. He trusts me on that and doesn&#39;t push the issues and he doesn&#39;t get put off by it. Not usually a problem because we only watch tv when at hotels/grandparents since we don&#39;t have cable/reception. Like your daughter, my son tends to think the mistreatment of children is far worse then a tank blowing up a building! He is just now getting over flashbacks of orphanage life but seeing starving homeless kids makes him feel miserable so i don&#39;t allow that. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nanyways, thanks again for making me think in a different manner :&gt;;<br/>\n<br/>\nJet Lakey  <br/>\n <br/>\n-live simply so others may simply live-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a><br/>\nDate: Mon, 2 Mar 2009 20:05:56 +0000<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: graphic novels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jet Lakey &lt;Jetlakey@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Pictures/plays don&#39;t squash the imagination.

If we get <br/>\nto a scene she&#39;s not happy with, we can decide what to do then - skip <br/>\nthe scene, turn the volume down, leave the room until the scene is <br/>\nover, turn it off entirely.

There is an idea that sometimes surfaces in  <br/>\nthese threads (graphic novels/ reading etc) that graphic novel reading  <br/>\nis a &quot;stage&quot; that a kid gets through before embracing other forms of  <br/>\nliterature.

It can be, but I think they (GNs) appeal to readers  <br/>\nin ways unique to the genre.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrayton is  a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan (as is his dad) and he loves  <br/>\ngraphic novels.   He just finished Watchmen and loved it.  There was  <br/>\nan age for him, maybe around 9 or 10 where he couldn&#39;t get enough  <br/>\nCalvin and Hobbes.  We took the entire collection out of the Library  <br/>\nmany many times and bought the anniversary collection when that came  <br/>\nout but he tells me now (he&#39;s standing here with me) that he didn&#39;t  <br/>\nget into the more serious graphic novels until he was a bit older.  He  <br/>\nloved several Japanese series especially Death Note.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, he was an early reader.  He was reading novels and  <br/>\nscience books and magazines and newspaper articles well before he  <br/>\ndiscovered comic books.  They flowed in and out together and seemed to  <br/>\nfill different needs at different times.  If you knew him at 10 you  <br/>\nmight have thought he wasn&#39;t much of a reader because he was so into  <br/>\nhis comics  but at least for him, one thing had nothing to do with the  <br/>\nother.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am certain that if I discouraged his love of comics instead of  <br/>\nembracing it with trips to the library and the comic store and Anime  <br/>\nExpo and and and.   He would not have then embraced novels or whatever  <br/>\npeople think is better.  It would have merely been a taking away.   <br/>\nthere would have been less for him to love and enjoy and learn from  <br/>\nnot more.

Knowing<br/>\nit&#39;s a good idea to get over prejudices is just the first step.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can probably tell from this post comics wasn&#39;t one of my  <br/>\nprejudices.  But thanks to frank discussions on these lists and from  <br/>\nunschoolers in our lives here, I have uncovered many of my own  <br/>\nprejudices that have  lurked where I didn&#39;t recognize them.  It really  <br/>\nis hard sometimes to see the roadblocks we put up because if they were  <br/>\nclear to us we wouldn&#39;t  put them there.  That is what is valuable  <br/>\nabout these discussions.

Children need a lot of <br/>\ntime and safe practice to become adults.  They are naturally adept at <br/>\nbeing children and need no assistance from parents with that.  <br/>\nBesides, the world needs more people who are twenty-year-old adults, <br/>\nand fewer who are 45 year-old adolescents.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gist of what&#39;s been shared on this thread has been, to my <br/>\nreading, about honouring the child&#39;s leading in support of respecting <br/>\nhis development into adulthood -- including respecting his right to <br/>\nread *this* over *that*, if *this* is what he prefers.  Perhaps it <br/>\nmay be that your son doesn&#39;t, as you later infer, love graphic <br/>\nnovels.  My three boys, 9, 6 and 4, haven&#39;t discovered them yet, <br/>\nmostly.  So I could also say, my boys don&#39;t love graphic novels <br/>\neither.  There&#39;s nothing inherently right or wrong about loving or <br/>\nenjoying or preferring any one thing over any other thing.  The <br/>\nunschooling dividing line on the question centers on when our <br/>\nchildren *do* discover an interest -- in comics, in painting, in <br/>\ndigging, in filming, in money, ad nauseum -- whether we support them <br/>\nin pursuing that interest or disallow them from pursuing that <br/>\ninterest ... or, shame them verbally or non-verbally for that <br/>\ninterest.  A statement like, &quot;There&#39;s no room on my bookshelves for <br/>\ngraphic novels&quot; does read like a spirit of conditional acceptance, <br/>\nand that&#39;s what&#39;s elicited the emphatic responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nPulling up the shirt sleeves and immersing oneself in a holistic new <br/>\nphilosophy of living is, I understand, a painstaking process.  <br/>\nExposing oneself to radically new ideas and contexts is rarely an <br/>\nuneventfully smooth transition.  This has been my experience:  <br/>\nunschooling, mindfully loving, unconditionally accepting, <br/>\nwholeheartedly supporting were so foreign to the highly conditional <br/>\nindoctrination of my growing up, I&#39;ve been pained and squeezed to vet <br/>\nmy reactions and mindsets about ideas to a community such as this.  <br/>\nAnd I&#39;ve stumbled -- and stumble still -- to fully embrace all the <br/>\njoy that is promised in a radically unschooled life.  And yet.  I <br/>\npick up my bruised ego, I dust off the roadsmear from my falling <br/>\ndowns, and hug my children, apologize, and chin up to carry on.  <br/>\nBecause I believe in this life that hope springs eternal.  And I <br/>\ntrust that *this* community, (this community of worldwide <br/>\nunschoolers) has my back like no other community ever has.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRetreat not, I implore.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoving,<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\nHost of Alphabet Soup: 2009 Calgary Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/\">http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BTW-I come from a long line of Artists.

It&#39;s valuable for kids to see us supporting their  <br/>\ninterests and trying to understand.

What are you basing that on?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is for critical examination of ideas and practices.  <br/>\nUnexamined ideas will get examined! Unquestioned feelings will get  <br/>\nquestioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlays are visuals combined with words. Why wouldn&#39;t the effect be the  <br/>\nsame? That&#39;s not asked in a snarky way. It&#39;s a real question. It&#39;s  <br/>\none of the ways theories are tested to see if they ring true. If  <br/>\nstatic pictures and words don&#39;t &quot;allow the power of the written word  <br/>\nto develop the scene&quot; then it would follow that plays would hamper it  <br/>\neven more since they include sound and movement. (And sometimes even  <br/>\nsmells!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don’t feel that they allow the power of the written word to  <br/>\n&gt; develop the scene in a child’s mind (and we were talking about an  <br/>\n&gt; 11 yr old..not a teenager or adults here).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because it sounds like it should make sense, what evidence do  <br/>\nyou have that it&#39;s actually so?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has been immersed in comics from 7ish to her current 17.  <br/>\nShe&#39;s written 5 novels (during National Novel Writing Month), has a  <br/>\ncomic that&#39;s been ongoing for 10 years, has gone through *cartons* of  <br/>\npaper with drawings and writings. She&#39;s one piece of data to the  <br/>\ncontrary. (And I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more.) Where&#39;s the unschooling data  <br/>\nthat supports your theory?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law believed that coloring books hampered kids&#39; artistic  <br/>\nability. She thought they should be drawing their own pictures, not  <br/>\ncoloring someone else&#39;s. That make sense. And yet my sister, my  <br/>\ndaughter and I all used coloring books and we&#39;re all artistic. None  <br/>\nof her 4 kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, coloring books didn&#39;t make us artistic ;-) But they didn&#39;t get in  <br/>\nthe way of it either. They were a way of playing with color without  <br/>\nworrying about form. Sometimes ideas that seem to make sense don&#39;t  <br/>\nplay out in real life. Our minds are *way* more complex than we give  <br/>\nthem credit for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I still don’t think they are appropriate for young minds that are  <br/>\n&gt; still developing their imaginings.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Little kids do have fantastic imaginations. They can combine bits and  <br/>\npieces in ways adults never would.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they also don&#39;t have a head full of images to build from. While  <br/>\nit&#39;s really cool to see the wild things kids can come up with when  <br/>\nall they have are sticks and stone to play with, that doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\ntheir imaginations are more free flowing than a child who loves  <br/>\nplaying with a huge collection of plastic dinosaurs. Just because the  <br/>\nimaginative play is  more apparent to use with the sticks and stones  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it actually is. (And based on the results of unschooled  <br/>\nkids who retain their imaginations with lots of fodder, there isn&#39;t  <br/>\nevidence to that  supports that sticks and stones are better.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWould giving them more images combined with words stop them from  <br/>\nmaking the wild combinations they do? Then why wouldn&#39;t picture books  <br/>\ninterfere? Why wouldn&#39;t plays and puppet shows interfere? (Cartoons,  <br/>\nmovies and TV too, but I&#39;m trying to avoid the side issue of people&#39;s  <br/>\nprejudice against the quality.) While I can see how someone might  <br/>\ncome up with that theory, it doesn&#39;t seem to hold up to thought, let  <br/>\nalone real life creative unschoolers whose media aren&#39;t narrowed by  <br/>\nparents who subscribe to that theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Seems everyone wants to argue the virtue of these things from an  <br/>\n&gt; adult (and I feel most teenagers have reached the point of  <br/>\n&gt; adulthood long before 18) standpoint when it was really about an 11  <br/>\n&gt; yr old boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>11 is a fairly typical age to be getting into graphic novels. That&#39;s  <br/>\nprobably the age my daughter and I read through all the Calvin and  <br/>\nHobbes. Maybe 13 when manga really took off with more affordable  <br/>\neditions and she got into that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And yes, I limit the type of tv my kid watches because he is young  <br/>\n&gt; an I am the parent and don’t feel that I should let my 6yr old son  <br/>\n&gt; watch pg-13 or R movies either.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone&#39;s nodding their  head in agreement, try reading here and  <br/>\nthen come back with your concerns:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a> (down the left side near the bottom)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I limit ... because he is young an I am the parent<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most people imagine when unschoolers say &quot;no limits&quot; that they mean  <br/>\nstand back and don&#39;t care. We care deeply. We *help* them explore.  <br/>\nInstead of limiting, we help them find the things they like and avoid  <br/>\nthe things they don&#39;t like. Rather than protecting them, we empower  <br/>\nthem so they can find ways to be more powerful than media so it  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have power over them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a surface answer, but obviously the topic is huge and takes an  <br/>\nenormous amount of time to discuss. (Which is why it&#39;s helpful to  <br/>\nhave places to send people so they can have new concerns answered  <br/>\nrather than recovering the same territory.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; don’t feel that I should let my 6yr old son watch pg-13 or R movies  <br/>\n&gt; either<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does he want to watch R movies?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems so obvious that we should keep little kids away from R  <br/>\nmovies, but how many little kids want to see them??? Sometimes  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll be drawn to a picture on a box or an image they&#39;ve seen. But  <br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean they have a full understanding of what they&#39;re  <br/>\nasking to see! So we help them understand. When they know that we&#39;re  <br/>\nnot being a roadblock to what they want, when they trust we&#39;re trying  <br/>\nto help them find what they enjoy, then they will take our thoughts  <br/>\nas information for decision making. If they decide they want to see  <br/>\nit, we can help them through it in lots of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hypotheticals aren&#39;t good for illuminating unschooling.  <br/>\nHypothetical children don&#39;t have real reasons for something. If  <br/>\nsomeone has a real 6 year old who wants to see an R rated movie, that  <br/>\nwould be much more useful to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This was about a discussion on the warrants of a type of media-not  <br/>\n&gt; on the type of parents we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, list members are discussing the merits of ideas that help  <br/>\nunschooling. The initial idea was a prejudice and bias against a  <br/>\nchild&#39;s interest because she thought the interest interfered with  <br/>\nlearning. The resulting discussion was 1) it&#39;s helpful to let go of  <br/>\nbiases against children&#39;s interests, 2) reasons why the medium isn&#39;t  <br/>\nas not &quot;real&quot; as she thought to *help* her let go of her bias.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion that branched off of yours continued that but also  <br/>\ntouched on the idea of supporting someone else&#39;s feelings that will  <br/>\nget in their way of unschooling. The list is for letting go of ideas  <br/>\nthat interfere with unschooling. it&#39;s a place to get support for  <br/>\nletting go. If someone needs support for *where they are*, there are  <br/>\nlots of lists for that. But the two needs need totally different  <br/>\napproaches that interfere with each other which is why there are  <br/>\ndifferent lists for each.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My son can give you a tour of almost every Smithsonian museum here  <br/>\n&gt; in dc (except the ones he doesn’t like).

My kids don&#39;t fit the <br/>\nbox made by those words. They see worlds within images - they create <br/>\nworlds with images. They are free to alter what they see, to <br/>\nreimagine it in their own ways, because They don&#39;t believe that they <br/>\ncan&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t change it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s something we do as an intimate bonding. we all curl up atÂ <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different points and read to each other. the others get the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>benefitÂ <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; of closing their eyes and having the story unfold to them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its a pretty picture.

Thanks to those who kept to the non personal issue that this was really about. Who shared their thoughts and why they love this style of art. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it&#39;s a shame that many of you honed in on a few of my statements and ignored the rest. there are some comments need to be addressed:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�Because when you &quot;hate&quot; something your child loves, it hurts them.<br/>\nHurting children is not the goal of unschooling. �<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhoever said my son loves these? Whoever said I was withholding them from him? I simply said that they I don�t think they are appropriate reading for a young child. I never said I shared those dislikes to my son. And believe me there are things I can�t stand but he would never know and I still do them with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�I&#39;d bet lots and lots of money on those readers being Adults� exactly. Not young children.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�I can point Betsie to many webpages that will support her &quot;right&quot; to quash whatever joy her child finds. I hope deeply that Betsie, and those like her, never ever find that support within the unschooling community.�<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWOW. How do you really feel about it? Direct your hostility off of Betsie..she simply asked some questions for support. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�Life is too short to say it&#39;s okay to rob your child of joy.�<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that most responses were about robbing kids of joy. Taking the things they love away from them. Nowhere was it posted that anyone was doing that. Just because this style of book isn&#39;t on someone&#39;s personal bookshelves does not mean that it is banned from reading. Just because a parent doesn�t like something doesn�t mean they withhold it from their kids. And if it was, that would be that family�s decision. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�Wow! How mean. That is just mean. To you and your son. I cry for you both... I cry, hoping you&#39;ll never have to apologize at his hospital bedside for such meanness. Or worse, apologize to his photograph because he doesn&#39;t talk to you anymore. And yeah, if you find it this easy to kick his joys off the bookshelf, there are lots of other joys you&#39;ll not <br/>\nhave room for either... �<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal attacks are not warranted. You do not know me, or what kind of parent I am. You attack me because I do not like a style of books/art and choose not to purchase them for my young son. I never attacked anyone here for their love of these books. I just told what I hated about them. Nor did I say you should not purchase them for your kids. Just because I choose not to purchase them does not mean I judge others for doing so..nor did I say that. What kind of lesson do you teach your kids when you name call others who do not agree with you.? Don�t cry for us. Our house is happy, full of love, full of love for learning and lots of joy..even without graphic novels. <br/>\n<br/>\n�If it&#39;s true that pictures squash the imagination, then stories would too. Shouldn&#39;t we be keeping kids from hearing other people&#39;s stories for fear of squashing their imaginations? TV and movies -- hey, and plays for that matter too! -- should *kill* imagination since it&#39;s <br/>\nnot just stories and pictures, but movement and sound. I&#39;m sure that sounds sarcastic, but they&#39;re serious questions.�<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPictures/plays don�t squash the imagination. But I do feel that books such as Bone etc that combine comic graphics with words do. I don�t feel that they allow the power of the written word to develop the scene in a child�s mind (and we were talking about an 11 yr old..not a teenager or adults here). And yes, I limit the type of tv my kid watches because he is young an I am the parent and don�t feel that I should let my 6yr old son watch pg-13 or R movies either. I don�t let him watch History channel when it has war stuff either (Hitler etc). there is a time and place for that and I don�t feel young kids have to be exposed to that right now. They have their whole lives to lose that innocence. I also wouldn�t allow porn in the house because I think it is demeaning to women. Even if he loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n�You&#39;ve pretty effectively dismissed the work every artist that&#39;s ever lived if you think the only worthwhile imaginings are created from words. That&#39;s not said to elicit an apology. It&#39;s said as a spark to thought.�<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI never said the only worthwhile imaginings were created from words. Nor do I dismiss the art that goes into graphics novels. I still don�t think they are appropriate for young minds that are still developing their imaginings. When they are older and everything is not as black and white. that�s a whole new story..and discussion. Seems everyone wants to argue the virtue of these things from an adult (and I feel most teenagers have reached the point of adulthood long before 18) standpoint when it was really about an 11 yr old boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW-I come from a long line of Artists. Writers. Hollywood screenplay writers. Heck, most of my siblings, my parents are involved in the industry in some way or another. You�ve seen their shows, their commercials, you�ve seen them on tv heard their music (all the way back to the dina shore show). Maybe even been in one of their art galleries in CA. Just because I don�t like a style of writing/art doesn�t mean I dismiss all art&lt;G&gt;. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say this. My son can give you a tour of almost every Smithsonian museum here in dc (except the ones he doesn�t like). He can probably out talk most adults on Lievens or Caldor. He can recognize a piece of Stickley for its lines. He�s seen more cultures and countries than any other kid I know his age (well, except for one of my friends who�s been to 1 more country than us)LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was about a discussion on the warrants of a type of media-not on the type of parents we are. so please refrain from the name calling and judgments and personal attacks because I don�t buy him graphic novels/books like bone, captain underpants whatever<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWindows Live� Groups: Create an online spot for your favorite groups to meet.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowslive.com/online/groups?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_groups_032009\">http://windowslive.com/online/groups?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_groups_032009</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":122460111,"authorName":"Tammy Curry","from":"Tammy Curry &lt;mamabeart00@...&gt;","profile":"mamabeart00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] graphic novels","postDate":"1235838088","msgId":38602,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzMzExOS4yMzkwNS5xbUB3ZWI0NTMxMi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDhDQjY3NDNBNDlDOTZFMy1FNTQtRjdGQFdFQk1BSUwtRFoyNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4gPDY1MThhOTM2MDkwMjI4MDAwNWc2MzI1ODNkYXJiMWYwMzk4MTVhYjM5ZjlhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38600,"nextInTopic":38606,"prevInTime":38601,"nextInTime":38603,"topicId":38568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Graphic novels have been around for a long time.

My dad told me that Playboy was for guys only, so I had an older friend buy me copies of Playgirl. But the underground comics were fascinating. By current standards they would be considered graphic novels. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome links to check out about Graphic Novels, that are a classic part of American literary history :<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.graphicnovels.brodart.com/history.htm\">http://www.graphicnovels.brodart.com/history.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ipl.org/div/procrast/graphicnovels/gnsHistBasics.html\">http://www.ipl.org/div/procrast/graphicnovels/gnsHistBasics.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel</a> (I am not the biggest of fan of Wikipedia but they do sometimes have excellent information)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that anything that captures the interest of a child&#39;s mind and lends itself to their creativity is worth allowing them to explore. My daughter has created artwork, which I need to scan so we can keep it forever, based on graphic novels she has read, anime movies and shows she has seen.

Tell that to Dick Tracy and\r<br/>\nNancy Worth!\r<br/>\nIf we actually did a study to see who purchased the most graphic novels\r<br/>\n(including comic strip collections, ala Calvin and Hobbes) do you really\r<br/>\nthink the vast majority of the readers (and lovers) thereof would be those\r<br/>\nmoving from baby books to chapter books?

These seem like fantastic<br/>\nthings to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just finished the graphic novels based on &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot;.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve now watched the movies, the series, read the books and graphic<br/>\nnovels. We have the best understanding of those characters and of<br/>\ntheir world (which is a beautiful one).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- My son loves calvin and hobbs-as do i but sorry, there isn&#39;t<br/>\nenough room on my bookshelves for it -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love C & H too! I would suggest that you find another bookshelf, or<br/>\nstack the books in a corner, use them as end tables or something. I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine telling my son or my husband that we didn&#39;t have room<br/>\nfor &#39;their&#39; books. AND lord knows, we don&#39;t have room for the books we<br/>\nhave now...but they all have homes (even the ones that are boxed up<br/>\nand rotated).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- again, this wasn&#39;t meant to tick off anyone, cause offense etc but<br/>\nto let betsie know she isn&#39;t the only one out there who would rather<br/>\nher son not read that err, stuff. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, unschooling isn&#39;t about me and what *I might rather* someone<br/>\ndo or not do. I&#39;d want people to seek out what brings them the most<br/>\nJoy and if that means shelves full of graphic novels, then that is<br/>\nawesome and I will do my best to support that passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Love.<br/>\nMichele James-Parham<br/>\nwww.naturalattachment.net</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] graphic novels","postDate":"1235785273","msgId":38576,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0MUZBQ0U5LURGNjYtNEY5OC05REM0LTc4NTc4QjkyNDBDNEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQjY3NDNBNDlDOTZFMy1FNTQtRjdGQFdFQk1BSUwtRFoyNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDQjY3NDNBNDlDOTZFMy1FNTQtRjdGQFdFQk1BSUwtRFoyNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38568,"nextInTopic":38577,"prevInTime":38575,"nextInTime":38577,"topicId":38568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t think &quot;slammed&quot; will be the word(s). Logical argument  <br/>\nprovided? Parent- child relationship advice? An alternate way to look  <br/>\nat it presented to you? Probably that&#39;s what you&#39;ll get &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I hate graphic books. I don&#39;t think they are the best choice for<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reading.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For you. Why wouldn&#39;t it be different for your kids? What happens if  <br/>\nyour son or daughter *loves* these graphic novels? If you can&#39;t hide  <br/>\nyour distaste for them, how will they feel about their choices?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think they totally squash the imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree. Some people&#39;s imaginations take off with visual input.  <br/>\nSome with auditory. Some with words on a page. Some with scent. Some  <br/>\nwith touch.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I think &quot;young<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; readers&quot; like Harry Potter (yes, i have reread the series 6 times-<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; geek i am), Chronicles and tons of others that have yet to make it<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to the big screen totally foster the imagination. they don&#39;t show  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a picture of what something looks like. they DESCRIBE it and you  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; form<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the vision for yourself. it opens up a whole world for you to create<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; your on vision based upon descriptions not visuals on a piece of<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; paper that allow no further imaginings or to think outside of the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; described box.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See above. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true that visuals allow no further  <br/>\nimagination. Cartoonists study other cartoonists to advance their own  <br/>\nideas and skills. So do movie producers. So do fine artists.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s like<br/>\n&gt; when babies move from &quot;picture books&quot; to<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; books with &quot;words&quot;. Now they have just given you more picture books<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; but in a more adult form.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm. This seems that you are saying that there is a logical, natural  <br/>\nand obligatory progression from visual (i.e. picture books) to print  <br/>\n(i.e. novels). It just isn&#39;t so, in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraphic novels can have very sophisticated language to accompany the  <br/>\nart. It *is* art. A person can gain an appreciation for words, story- <br/>\ntelling, art and creative methods through graphic novels. Manga is a  <br/>\nwonder to me. Complicated story lines, beautifully drawn characters  <br/>\nthat I couldn&#39;t imagine in my wildest dreams, cultural information, a  <br/>\nnew language. This is no better than a toddler&#39;s picture book?  <br/>\n(Actually, I think reading the New York Times to babies is equally  <br/>\ngood. It&#39;s the words and  how you say them that can be so satisfying  <br/>\nfor both baby and parent.)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; How about books from popular movies? Star wars? Spiderwick? Even the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; silly quickies like Geronimo stilton (may be to easy for him but the<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; stories can be finished in a couple hrs). Encyclopedia brown? They<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have to be &quot;classics&quot; or great literary works but I do see why<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; you would want him to move away from the graphic to more imagination<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; building books.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, it&#39;s okay to take a visual medium (amazing in its own right) and  <br/>\nmake it into print, but not the other way around?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Imagination building books&quot; is an interesting phrase. Every book I  <br/>\nown helps me build my imagination. Graphic novels and picture books  <br/>\nincluded!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not saying you have to force the hardy boys on your son but you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have to buy him the &quot;comic book types&quot; either. We read out  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; loud<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; all the time. My husband reads to me in bed and visa versa. My son<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; perfers that we read to him. Right now it&#39;s huck finn (he loved tom<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sawyer..especially imagining what it would look like to poke a  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tick).<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s something we do as an intimate bonding. we all curl up at<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; different points and read to each other. the others get the benefit<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of closing their eyes and having the story unfold to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reading together is a delightful experience and I miss it now that my  <br/>\ndd prefers to read happily on her own (graphic novels, manga, novels,  <br/>\nreference books, mysteries, comics, computer screens, etc. &lt;g&gt;). She  <br/>\nlapped up those words and the cuddles. But, she got to choose what she  <br/>\nwanted to read, then as now, without my judgment about the materials.  <br/>\nSure, I&#39;d strew what I thought was interesting and she could pick it  <br/>\nup or not. It&#39;s been fascinating to watch her decision-making.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; maybe you<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; could try that? not as a substitution but as an addition? Maybe<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hearing some of the non-graphic books might spur him on to the  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; other.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It might. But it might not. Then what?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my son loves calvin and hobbs-as do i but sorry, there isn&#39;t enough<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; room on my=2<br/>\n&gt; 0bookshelves for it<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good grief, why not? It&#39;s brilliant stuff! Not everything with print  <br/>\nonly is on my bookshelf, nor everything graphic. But Calvin & Hobbes?  <br/>\nAlways!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an appropriate Calvin & Hobbes for these days.

Nah...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if Betsie were to talk to more parents who send their  <br/>\nkids to school, or do school-at-home, she wouldn&#39;t be alone, either.  <br/>\nBut, to unschool well, it&#39;s helpful to think in terms of building up a  <br/>\nrelationship with our kids - one that breeds trust and respect. Part  <br/>\nof that is understanding our kids&#39; passions and not only accepting  <br/>\nthem, but enjoying those passions with them, in whatever way we can.  <br/>\nFeeding those passions, in fact. It&#39;s funny how kids will go on to  <br/>\ndifferent interests  when you let them get whatever it is they need  <br/>\nfrom what they are doing right now. It&#39;s also funny how they don&#39;t  <br/>\nwhen we restrict them for whatever noble reason we think we should.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m excerpting Pam S.&#39;s article &quot;How to Be a Good Unschooler&quot; here,  <br/>\nbecause she puts it so well:<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Homeschooled children who grow up in a stimulating and enriched  <br/>\nenvironment surrounded by family and friends who are generally  <br/>\ninterested and interesting, will learn all kinds of things and  <br/>\nrepeatedly surprise you with what they know. If they are supported in  <br/>\nfollowing their own passions, they will build strengths upon strengths  <br/>\nand excel in their own ways whether that is academic, artistic,  <br/>\nathletic, interpersonal, or whichever direction that particular child  <br/>\ndevelops. One thing leads to another. A passion for playing in the  <br/>\ndirt at six can become a passion for protecting the natural  <br/>\nenvironment at 16 and a career as a forest ranger as an adult. You  <br/>\njust never ever know where those childhood interests will eventually  <br/>\nlead. Be careful not to squash them; instead, nurture them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"graphic novels","postDate":"1235774479","msgId":38568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjY3NDNBNDlDOTZFMy1FNTQtRjdGQFdFQk1BSUwtRFoyNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38576,"prevInTime":38567,"nextInTime":38569,"topicId":38568,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The following was a post by a member still on moderation.
