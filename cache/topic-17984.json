I just re-read the county&#39;s requirements and yes, I need to keep a file of &quot;proof of learning&quot; I&#39;ll call it, along with what&#39;s taught for two years.  I&#39;m not really all that concerned as my son is already at eight, reading better then most high school graduates.  He qualifies for the &quot;gifted&quot; program but the teacher was a nasty woman.  I have given him freedom to learn what he loves and he is growing by leaps and bounds.  I will still have to have him do the stupid FCAT (it really is a poor test) or have an evaluator come in for a yearly report of his progress.  So curently, I&#39;m just saving ALL his projects, pictures, stories and games he has created.<br/>\nIf he gets a good evaluation or good score on the FCAT (or similiar test)  I don&#39;t think they will bother to look further.  So on that note, I guess I&#39;m not completely free to totally unschool as I&#39;ll need to show proof.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\nDeb Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ***Wow.
