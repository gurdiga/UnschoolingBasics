His behavior on the<br/>\nother hand, is very difficult.  He argues with me on every point.  I<br/>\nfeel like he&#39;s a teenager already.  All he wants to eat is cereal<br/>\nand other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let<br/>\nhim and let him discover how his diet effects him, but..there are<br/>\nothers in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of<br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I&#39;m thinking that you should help him understand how different <br/>\nfoods effect his body. Not just let him loose to figure it out on his <br/>\nown. Help him!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5). I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine letting him eat what ever he wants and letting him decide<br/>\nwhen to go to bed.  Lack of sleep makes him even more irritable,<br/>\nwhich increases the likelihood that he will verbally or physically<br/>\nabusive to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about offering a large sampling of *many* different foods. Chances <br/>\nare he&#39;ll eat all the carbs first, at first. But if you make a large <br/>\nplatter with rolled up meats, sliced cheeses, peanut butter on <br/>\ncrackers, grapes, baby carrots with dill dip, pickles, and a handful of <br/>\nM&Ms, he&#39;ll probably eat some/most of the other stuff after eating the <br/>\nM&Ms. (This was what was on a monkey platter here the other day. Only a <br/>\ncouple of pickles came back to the kitchen.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about drawing him a warm bath, making him a cup of hot chocolate, <br/>\nturning down the lights, rubbing his feet with oil or lotion, and <br/>\nsnuggling up with a gentle book/music/movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not advocating just cutting out sleep and good foods. We&#39;re <br/>\nsuggesting that you make the environment *right*. Nutricious food and a <br/>\nsleepy atmosphere will lead to a happier child.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure that his self-esteem is low due to all the trouble<br/>\nhe has gotten into regarding his aggression.  Over the years I have<br/>\nread all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory<br/>\nadvice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we&#39;re saying to just love him up all you can.

Plastic animals just love to go the park and get covered up with sand. They like sliding down the slide and going on treasure hunts in the grassy jungles of a backyard. They can play hide and seek, catch or skateboard. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour imagination is the best toy you&#39;ve got!

(My son had that <br/>\ncontrary phase when he was 3.5.  If I said there was a nice, blue <br/>\nsky, he would say, no, it&#39;s an ugly green or some such.  It DID <br/>\nimprove, and he is now a delightful 14 yr old!)  Keep that in mind.  <br/>\nTeens are transitioning from childhood to adulthood.  Sometimes they <br/>\nwant to be treated as/act as adults, other times as children.  And if <br/>\nyou don&#39;t read their minds as to which ...  (I&#39;ve heard this is <br/>\nespecially true with 15 yr old boys, but since mine isn&#39;t yet, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say!)  Well, toddlers are transitioning between babyhood and <br/>\nchildhood -- and the same thing applies.  But worse, they don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe verbal and cognitive skills to express themselves appropriately, <br/>\nand so it sometimes comes out in behavior, or poor word choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to think about -- is he bored?  My son, I <br/>\nretrospectively realized, was probably bored when he had this <br/>\ncontrary behavior.  Of course, part of it has been developmental <br/>\nstage stuff, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;All he wants to eat is cereal <br/>\n&gt; and other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let <br/>\n&gt; him and let him discover how his diet effects him, but..there are <br/>\n&gt; others in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of <br/>\n&gt; control.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I will let others address this -- not in my realm of experience, but <br/>\nI do have a carb fiend son, too.  However, he also likes cheese and <br/>\nalways has, and now beef jerky, almonds, etc.  Can the cereal be <br/>\nbalanced with protein -- milk or some such?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; He is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is prompting this behavior?  Is it lack of ability to <br/>\ncommunicate verbally what he is feeling (keep in mind that even very <br/>\nverbal kids often can&#39;t verbalize certain feelings; my son was like <br/>\nthat -- could NOT verbalize negative emotions when he was little)?  <br/>\nOr perhaps she is pushing his buttons?  Or something else, or some <br/>\ncombination?  Finding out what is causing the behavior makes it <br/>\neasier to address it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure that his self-esteem is low due to all the trouble <br/>\n&gt; he has gotten into regarding his aggression.  Over the years I have <br/>\n&gt; read all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory <br/>\n&gt; advice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And he probably does it so often now, that you find it hard to see <br/>\nthe flashes of the child you know exists in there.  I would try to <br/>\nfind specific instances when he is behaving in a positive manner, or <br/>\nshowing self-control, and specifically praise that.  BE SPECIFIC -- <br/>\notherwise it is meaningless, and he will not respect it.  &quot;Wow, I <br/>\nnoticed how hard it was for you to not bite when you really wanted <br/>\nto.&quot;  Or whatever is appropriate.  But the feedback has to be <br/>\nspecific.  &quot;Good job behaving&quot; just won&#39;t cut it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   <br/>\n&gt; Now, I try to involve myself in my children&#39;s interactions and to <br/>\n&gt; keep them busy.

Do you think you could <br/>\nhelp me so we can all have more fun together later?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this is helpful or not, but I hope you find the <br/>\nanswers you are looking for.  And remember, change happens slowly <br/>\nsometimes, so try not to be discouraged if things don&#39;t change <br/>\novernight.

I recently <br/>\ntook him out of PS because I knew it was not the place for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEver since he was a toddler I struggled with his behavior.  Over the <br/>\nyears, I learned that much of our conflicts revolved around our <br/>\ntemperaments. Back then I was totally clueless about things like <br/>\nspiritual development and child rearing.  My son&#39;s personality was <br/>\nshaped amidst negativity and disrespect-something I am working <br/>\ndiligently to rectify now. Unfortunately, my husband has not made <br/>\nthe same choice.  He continues to speak to our children <br/>\ndisrespectfully. <br/>\nNow here&#39;s the challenge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is wonderful and I love him dearly.  His behavior on the <br/>\nother hand, is very difficult.  He argues with me on every point.  I <br/>\nfeel like he&#39;s a teenager already.  All he wants to eat is cereal <br/>\nand other carbs.  I know most of you are thinking that I should let <br/>\nhim and let him discover how his diet effects him, but..there are <br/>\nothers in the house that suffer when his behavior is out of <br/>\ncontrol.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is constantly hitting and pinching his sister (5). I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine letting him eat what ever he wants and letting him decide <br/>\nwhen to go to bed.  Lack of sleep makes him even more irritable, <br/>\nwhich increases the likelihood that he will verbally or physically <br/>\nabusive to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure that his self-esteem is low due to all the trouble <br/>\nhe has gotten into regarding his aggression.  Over the years I have <br/>\nread all kinds of parenting books that gave me contradictory <br/>\nadvice.  All that flip-flopping was confusing I&#39;m sure.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nNow, I try to involve myself in my children&#39;s interactions and to <br/>\nkeep them busy.  That seems to cut down on volitility, however I <br/>\ncan&#39;t get much done if I&#39;m playing &quot;pioneer&quot; with them All day.  So, <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m looking for here is some advice on how to respect his <br/>\nchoices, help him learn his body&#39;s needs and keep the rest of us <br/>\nsafe.
