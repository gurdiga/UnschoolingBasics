Zach had pushed him off of him and<br/>\naccidently scratched him. Both boys are angry feeling like the other did it<br/>\npurposely. I don&#39;t want to take sides...I&#39;ve tried talking to them alone and<br/>\nasking if there was anything they could do diferently etc. But it still goes<br/>\non.Any ideas?\r<br/>\n  I end up telling Zach that he needs to keep his hands off of the young<br/>\nones but that isn&#39;t fair because Jacob gets rough sometimes.
