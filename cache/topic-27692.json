About how it makes me feel when he does this. We talked about alternative ways to handle the situations. He told me how difficult it is for him to be around someone he doesn&#39;t respect. I shared some examples of situations where I felt the same way and how hard it was for me and how I handled it. He apologized to me and then called his friend, whose mother he had had words with earlier in the day, and apologized to him. I think we are better on our way to understanding each other and we just need to make sure that that line of communication stays open. <br/>\nThanks for the input.<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 11/11/2007 9:32:24 A.M.
