In fact, if it&#39;s a really good read, I can get snippy if I&#39;m <br/>\ninterrupted. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she meant &quot;zone out&quot; as in no brain activity.  Not engaged.  I<br/>\nthink she might have meant that if one is engrossed in a book one&#39;s mind<br/>\nis busy as opposed to sitting in front of the TV with no brain activity. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can sit with a book in my hand looking at the words not comprehending a<br/>\nthing; realizing later that my mind was working on something else<br/>\nentirely.  Sometimes I&#39;ve flipped back whole chapters until I recognize<br/>\nthe plot again, after having supposedly &quot;read&quot; those pages.    Was I<br/>\nzoned out?   My brain was doing something, reviewing a previous<br/>\nconversation, making a shopping list, retracing events that lead to an<br/>\nargument.  Is that zoned out?   If it is, then I suggest zoning out has a<br/>\nvalue of it&#39;s own.   Even if there&#39;s no tangible evidence of our brain<br/>\nactivity (number of pages read) we can be making vital discoveries and<br/>\nconnections that will help us in our next moments or our next<br/>\ninteractions with others.  Even if I had minimal brain activity in those<br/>\nmoments (and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible) who&#39;s to say that isn&#39;t<br/>\nexactly what I needed?  Who&#39;s to say that isn&#39;t some kind of mental<br/>\nhealth preservation technique humans evolved over time to help us cope<br/>\nwith stress?  Maybe in those moments my blood pressure drops, my heart<br/>\nrates slows, my adrenaline levels subside and I am truly calm.  Maybe I<br/>\njust added an extra year to my life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with TV.  Although I don&#39;t believe that children who stare at the TV<br/>\nand ignore their mom&#39;s voice are necessarily &quot;zoned out.&quot;  I think a<br/>\ncouple of different things can be happening.  The obvious one is that<br/>\nwhat their seeing is stimulating them more and better in that moment than<br/>\nmom.  That&#39;s probably kind of scary for some moms.  Kind of insulting,<br/>\nmaybe?   Another thing might be that they *need* to ignore mom if her<br/>\nvoice is interfering in their pursuit.  Sometimes we have to emotionally<br/>\ndisconnect ourselves from a downer.  That&#39;s probably a little scary for<br/>\nmoms too.  Our kids shouldn&#39;t think of our guidance and wisdom as a<br/>\ndowner.   If they do we see that as a failing on their part, as<br/>\nmisbehaving or as being a brat.  But if our kids are experiencing our<br/>\nwisdom and guidance as negativity, something depressing, a bummer, that&#39;s<br/>\n*our* problem and we need to fix that.   It&#39;s *our* failing.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a kid who is staring at TV, even if later they can&#39;t tell you<br/>\nwhat they watched, is getting something valuable from that.  They might<br/>\nbe absorbing more than they can explain.  They might be working on some<br/>\nproblem.  They might be day dreaming.  They might be taking a much needed<br/>\nbreak from a controlling mom.    None of that is &quot;zoned out.&quot;   None of<br/>\nthat is bad, none is proof of brain death. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, if there is a &quot;zone&quot; of minimal brain activity, who&#39;s to say<br/>\nthat it&#39;s not just what that child needed in that moment? <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people study meditation for *years* to be able to reach a state of<br/>\nmental and physical calm.  They pay for expert teachers.   They&#39;re trying<br/>\nto get to the zone.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nParents should be making life interesting for kids.  If the most<br/>\ninteresting thing is TV sometimes I&#39;m grateful we have that!  If the most<br/>\ninteresting thing is TV most of the time, then I&#39;m not doing my job. I&#39;m<br/>\nnot being a good tour guide. &lt;g&gt;  Taking away the TV won&#39;t make a kid&#39;s<br/>\nlife more interesting and without a fun tour guide to the rest of the<br/>\nworld it will actually be making life less interesting.   If parents are<br/>\nmaking the world available to their kids, then there&#39;s no point in taking<br/>\nTV away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we see TV negatively because moms are get pissed off when a kid<br/>\nwould rather look at Power Rangers than dust the piano.  I think we see<br/>\nTV negatively because teachers get pissed off if an episode of &quot;That&#39;s So<br/>\nRaven&quot; kept a kid from finishing boring homework.  I think as parents<br/>\nwe&#39;d like to be the most interesting things in our kids life and it<br/>\ninsults us if we feel like we come in second, (or further down the list)<br/>\nto SpongeBob or Seinfeld or Godzilla.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, get up and be interesting!  And be grateful there are Cartoons and<br/>\ncomedians and monsters for the occasions when you don&#39;t have much to<br/>\noffer.  &lt;g&gt;  Be glad you can give your kids a big life! <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252551372,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;supenn@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Zoning out was intro/coffee","postDate":"1145283448","msgId":12194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3RDYyRTk5LTQ4MjItNEJFRC1BNzA4LTYwRDYyQzNDMUMzQ0BkaWVyYXVlci5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFlMjZhNTcxMDYwNDE3MDQ0OG8xOWRkZTg3YWphYmFiYTFmMWIyOWYyYWE0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDE3MDAxOS41OTk0NDQzMTczNzFhMEBybHkteGswNS5teC5hb2wuY29tPiA8OEM4MzAxRUZDOEQyRDcxLUNGNC00MkVFQG1ibGstcjQwLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8YWUyNmE1NzEwNjA0MTcwNDQ4bzE5ZGRlODdhamFiYWJhMWYxYjI5ZjJhYTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12191,"nextInTopic":12196,"prevInTime":12193,"nextInTime":12195,"topicId":12170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As a child<br/>\nand teen I read a lot as a socially acceptable form of escapism. It was very<br/>\neffective for me. I couild tune out just about anyone and everything. Once I<br/>\nhad kids, it didn&#39;t take me long to realize how easily I could neglect them<br/>\nby reading. I just can&#39;t seem to stop part way through. I can tell myself<br/>\ntht the book isn&#39;t going anywhere, it will be there when I get back...it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter. I finally just stopped reading fiction for myself. I simply<br/>\ncan&#39;t maintain a balance. It can even happen with books on tape. It&#39;s quite<br/>\na joke in the family if I&#39;m driving and there is a particularly good book<br/>\nwe&#39;re listining to. I have been known to go miles past our exit before even<br/>\nrealizing it. Totally on auto-pilot. Now the kids know to pay attention and<br/>\nkeep me in reality. TV doesn&#39;t do that do me. I can have the tv on and do<br/>\nany number of other tasks. For me tv is a much better use of my time than<br/>\nreading is.  At least for now.  None of my kids have the same problem with<br/>\nreading. They enjoy reading, but can usually put a book down and rarely does<br/>\na book take over their lives. For me, books are not the wonderful good thing<br/>\nsociety says they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-17, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/17/06, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Misty Felner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:misty@...\">misty@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How many people zone out reading a book?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ME!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In fact, if it&#39;s a really good read, I can get snippy if I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; interrupted.
