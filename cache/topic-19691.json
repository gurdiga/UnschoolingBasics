At 8 1/2, he reads pretty much anything<br/>\nat will. It&#39;s kind of like taking a white shirt and putting it in a pot<br/>\nof red dye - it can&#39;t help but pick up the dye. Similarly, kids in our<br/>\nculture are *surrounded* by words - on commercials, road signs, games,<br/>\netc as well as books and magazines. Closed captioning (when done well,<br/>\nnot the stuff on live sportscasts) is really cool because they can *see*<br/>\nthe action, *hear* the words, AND *see* the words all at the same time.<br/>\nWhen my DS was wanting to read (he said &quot;We need to get Hooked on<br/>\nPhonics so I can learn to read&quot;), I already knew that he knew many words<br/>\non sight (and really, isn&#39;t that what &#39;fluent&#39; reading is, knowing words<br/>\non sight - how many adults reading this are sounding out every word, or<br/>\neven reading every single solitary word - nope, fluent readers read in<br/>\n&#39;groups&#39; of words, glossing over little words like &#39;the&#39;). BUT he had<br/>\nthe idea that reading was difficult (thanks to all the phonics<br/>\ncommercials). We spent a total of about 1 hr over 3 nights with the Bob<br/>\nbooks and that convinced him that he could read &quot;Hey I&#39;m a reader!&quot; with<br/>\nface all aglow (and even then, we didn&#39;t do them as &#39;instructed&#39; - we<br/>\njust picked books from the set and first night I read them all, second<br/>\nnight he read one, third night we did a random half dozen or so together<br/>\nand that was it). All he really needed was to know that he *was* reading<br/>\nalready and he took off. <br/>\n <br/>\nSome things we did with him included: reading aloud to him; turning on<br/>\nclosed captioning; playing with letter magnets on the fridge (&quot;Mommy,<br/>\nwhat does qrwztymbklf spell?&quot; - time to discuss vowels and how they help<br/>\nMommy not sprain her tongue LOL); &#39;buddy reading&#39; where he was<br/>\n&#39;responsible&#39; for one or two words in a story (like Stop and Dog in Go,<br/>\nDog, Go) and I&#39;d read the rest, pausing for him to fill in his word,<br/>\nthen continuing. That led gradually to alternating words, sentences,<br/>\nparagraphs, pages as *he* chose (that&#39;s big, it wasn&#39;t an assignment or<br/>\nlesson, I&#39;d ask if he wanted to do a word, if so, great, if not, great)<br/>\n- sometimes he wanted to just listen, sometimes he wanted to read<br/>\ntogether, and eventually, sometimes he wanted to read to me (one time, I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t feeling well and headed to bed early. He came in with a favorite<br/>\nbook and said he was going to read to me to help me get to sleep and<br/>\nfeel better. So I just closed my eyes and listened to him read me to<br/>\nsleep.) Also, as he was wanting to read more himself, we went back to<br/>\nhis old favorite board books for a bit - stories he knew by heart and<br/>\nloved, stories that are designed for adults to read to kids, not &quot;early<br/>\nreaders&quot;, he knew the words by sound and could now sort out which<br/>\nsymbols went with which sounds. DH learned the same way per MIL - he<br/>\nwent off with a favorite book (&quot;Johnny Lion&#39;s Book&quot;) and proceeded to<br/>\nmatch up the symbols (aka &#39;words&#39;) with the sounds he knew so well. Of<br/>\ncourse, then MIL called the school DH would be attending in the fall for<br/>\nK and asked what she should do to assist him now that he was beginning<br/>\nto read. They told her NOT to LET him read because he&#39;d learn it all<br/>\nwrong. She ignored them.<br/>\n <br/>\nOkay, now, my best guess as to *how* DS learned to read (since we<br/>\ncertainly didn&#39;t sit him down and teach him, not even sight words.<br/>\nClosest we came was answering a gazillion &quot;what&#39;s that say?&quot; questions).<br/>\nHe&#39;d suck in words like a vacuum - &quot;what&#39;s this say? what&#39;s that say?<br/>\nThat says Stop!&quot; and listening to us read to him. Then, internally, he&#39;d<br/>\nbreak things into pattern blocks or chunks which he&#39;d then apply to new<br/>\nwords he met. Kind of like digesting pasta primavera into carbs,<br/>\nproteins, vitamins etc and using them to fuel your body. Example: he<br/>\n&#39;met&#39; the word &quot;water&quot;, and had &quot;gathered&quot; the blocks: w, at, er Then he<br/>\nmet the word &quot;weather&quot;. Looks similar, apply known blocks, context<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit, look for other known blocks, ask questions. So, he&#39;d ask<br/>\nand we&#39;d say &quot;That&#39;s weather&quot; and point out the ea and th blocks (based<br/>\non hearing his first try) so now he has w, at, er, ea, and th blocks to<br/>\napply. And so on. But way less &quot;solid&quot;, lots more &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; type<br/>\napproximations applied on his part to figure things out (again, that&#39;s<br/>\njust my guesstimate of what was happening internally). While his<br/>\nage-mates in Bible class were hesitantly sounding their way through<br/>\nthings, I was getting comments on how well he read *from public school<br/>\nteacher friends* who were teaching his Bible classes. When they&#39;d ask<br/>\nhow we taught him to read so well, we&#39;d just smile, shrug and say We<br/>\ndidn&#39;t! He learned to read, we didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; him (in the common usage<br/>\nof that word, implying some form of structured plan of tuition applied<br/>\nto a student rather than springing from the learner).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

My son learns by<br/>\n  leaps and bounds on a daily basis.  He reads everything and reads at a high level<br/>\n  just because he has found books contain tons of awesome information.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Recently, while playing a computer game, he learned of General George S. Patton.<br/>\n  That lead to a google search for more info on Patton.  Since my son, George,  and Patton share a name and a military passion, General Patton is my son&#39;s new hero.  My son<br/>\n  was thrilled when he learned that Patton was homeschooled, also.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yesterday, once again while playing another computer game, he decided he wanted to<br/>\n  learn more about the Greek Gods.  Needless to say, he researched it and quenched <br/>\n  his thirst.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As for learning sight words and spelling and such....Let me just say that in February, 2006,<br/>\n  my son left his spelling book in GA on purpose.  When we were just up there, for fun he <br/>\n  wanted to see if he could spell those words even though he never studied them.  So I called out the word lists and surprise, surprise, without ever studying them, he knew them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n \t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nEveryone is raving about the all-new Yahoo!

That&#39;s too bad that your <br/>\ngetting so much pressure when your daughter is 5 years old.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters really do read.  One is nearly 12 and the other just <br/>\nturned 7.  No phonics teaching, no workbooks, no specifically &quot;learn <br/>\nto read&quot; games.  It really did just happen.  They are quite <br/>\ndifferent in personality, and they learned at different ages, but it <br/>\nhappened.  What did I do?  With my older dd, I read to her A LOT.  <br/>\nShe loved it, and she always wanted to know what everything was.  <br/>\nShe started reading when she was 3, and I know that&#39;s not common.  <br/>\nWith my younger dd, I read her a lot of stuff on video games even <br/>\nmore than books because that&#39;s what she liked. She just turned 7 <br/>\nlast month and really started reading about 6 months ago.  They both <br/>\nplay on the computer a lot.  Also my older dd discovered closed <br/>\ncaptioning on the TV once when she was about 4 or 5, and we always <br/>\nhave that on because she likes it.  That&#39;s pretty much it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll find a lot of great stuff about learning to read if you <br/>\nfollow some of the links at the left here.  Joyfully Rejoycing and <br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s site are both great with lots of stories.  All of the <br/>\nolder unschoolers do know how to read.  They learned at lots of <br/>\ndifferent ages, but they all learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as sight words, we&#39;ve had no trouble with words that don&#39;t <br/>\nfollow certain rules because we don&#39;t teach those rules!  Sounds <br/>\nsilly, but it&#39;s true.  If these are common words, your child will <br/>\nsee them a lot.  If she wants to know what a word is, just tell <br/>\nher.  If she asks again, tell her again.  Eventually she&#39;ll just <br/>\nknow it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there comes a time when she feels bad about not knowing how to <br/>\nread, be confident that she will.  Because she will, really.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n-Christy M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Parents of older unschooled kids out there...how?? did your kids <br/>\n&gt; learn to read..and specifically those damn sight words that <br/>\n&gt; apparently do not follow the rules!!!!

He pulls <br/>\nDr Seuss books off his shelf sometimes to look through by himself. I <br/>\nsstill read to him. We just finished _Revenge of the Shadow King_. I <br/>\nread, and he followed along. He read paragraphs every now and <br/>\nthen---with FEELING----and with accents! &lt;G&gt; We&#39;re starting _The Once <br/>\nand Future King_ this week (more accents! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I was in Charleston visiting a friend with a seven year old. <br/>\nIn school.
