Going in slowly so as not to <br/>\nbe overwhelmed makes more sense.  Naturally, as you learn more/read <br/>\nmore *feel your way* more you become more relaxed.  (I am talking <br/>\nhere about parents who have had children in ps or have been <br/>\ndoing &quot;strict&quot; homeschooling.)  Imagine, if you will, being tossed <br/>\noff into the deep end of the pool, as opposed to walking down the <br/>\nsteps and trying out different things before you swim. Maybe you can <br/>\nlearn to swim both ways, but the first way you are a LOT more likely <br/>\nto get scared and get out of the water as quickly as possible and <br/>\nnot try again.

All I said was to allow new <br/>\nunschoolers to take it slowly and for older unschoolers to not to <br/>\nblast newer ones for easing in instead of jumping.  I have noticed a <br/>\nlot of veteran unschoolers who say, &quot;This way or else.&quot;  There is no <br/>\nset of rules for unschooling...it is whatever works for your <br/>\nfamily...child-driven...delight-driven...life living...  What you do <br/>\nnow will probably change by next year.  As you read more about <br/>\nunschooling new doors open in your mind...for example, you begin by <br/>\nending forced teaching, that&#39;s a good first step.  Second, you might <br/>\nend tv/computer time limits.  Then you may decide chores are <br/>\nunnecessary and getting in the way of a relaxed lifestyle.  Little <br/>\nsteps, but necessary to make the transition.  Families are so <br/>\ndifferent, I don&#39;t believe there could be ONE way to unschool for <br/>\neveryone.  As the ones who have been unschooling longer, it is up to <br/>\nus to present unschooling as something do-able...eat the elephant <br/>\none bite at a time, as it were. <br/>\nIf you are able to just jump in, that is wonderful!  The sooner you <br/>\nrelease your children the better.  But, not everyone will be able <br/>\nto.  Some have outside issues (ex-husbands, for example), or some <br/>\nare fighting battles in their own homes (husbands, for example).  <br/>\nEach step toward unschooling is better than doing nothing. <br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is better to take baby steps and <br/>\nbecome an unschooler than to jump in, get wet, then decide it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work because it was too overwhelming.<br/>\nI know I have rambled terribly...I apologize, I have just taken a <br/>\nheadache pill and it has made me woozy.<br/>\nPaige</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: taking it slow was re: &quot;the test&quot;","postDate":"1143089368","msgId":11002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzMjMyMDA2MDQ0OS4xNDA1Ni40NDIyMjhEODAwMEEwMUYxMDAwMDM2RTgyMjA2OTk5NzM1MEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11001,"nextInTopic":11003,"prevInTime":11001,"nextInTime":11003,"topicId":10986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It is a step in the right direction afterall. <br/>\n<br/>\nI kept doing a few schooly things when Conor first came out of school. It was all I knew and I thought he enjoyed them.
