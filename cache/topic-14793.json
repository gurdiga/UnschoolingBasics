Sometimes if it&#39;s <br/>\nrowdier than I am up for I&#39;ll take the book to my room for  quiet time. I&#39;ve done <br/>\nthis forever- before kids, when they were babies,  toddlers, now that there <br/>\nare two teens and an 8 yr old, and I&#39;ll do it when  they&#39;re all in college and <br/>\ndh and I are retired.  =)&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed how many children you have. This is a good topic as families get  <br/>\nlarger and unschooling becomes more publicized.<br/>\nWe have four ages 2, 4, 6 and 14.9. I know it&#39;s a challenge to balance  time <br/>\nso I do make time for each child. Cameron, our 2 yr old has  required much <br/>\nmore of my time so I have needed to work around that.<br/>\nSunday for instance I took just Nicholas (4) grocery shopping and  Saturday <br/>\nCassidy and I went to a few places and later built a bird house at  midnight. <br/>\nWith small children (thinking of my 2 yr old) I too need a break  however I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get one and not my children. Children need alone time just as  adults do. I <br/>\nknow for our children if I asked (which I don&#39;t need to bc they  tell me) <br/>\nthey want time with just us or to do something alone. <br/>\n <br/>\nDustin is much older and a free thinker so If I don&#39;t make that teen time  <br/>\nour communication breaks down and he lets me know. When I take a business trip I <br/>\n take him. This year we went to NY and Canada and it was great having him <br/>\nwith  me. Being one day trips and travel time being as it was he was the  best <br/>\noption. The kids are a large part of the business success.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do know families who say all or nothing and I can see the bummer look on  <br/>\nthe older kids faces when they want to do a teen thing without a toddler. Teens <br/>\n are not mini parents and with several children they do become that (which in <br/>\n moderation I think is good exposure BUT not forced or required) all the time <br/>\nIMO  is unfair to them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am busy with four however my relationship with all of my kids is equally  <br/>\nimportant so we tweak day to day, hour to hour and minute to minute. There are  <br/>\ncompromises needed and no one goes without their wish it&#39;s just  delayed <br/>\n*sometimes* while we finish what another child was doing or going (if we  can&#39;t <br/>\nfind a solution to make it happen often we do). That said I don&#39;t  regret having <br/>\nthe 2nd,3rd or 4th child.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have been known to spend our anniversary in a hotel with the  kids and at <br/>\nthe conference we needed to change gears so all could be  happy(Nicholas <br/>\nwanted to go home).<br/>\n <br/>\nTo address the original Q from Laura.. Two (b and g 8 years apart) was too  <br/>\nspread apart for me. 3 was nice as is 4.  I&#39;d say it depends on the parents  <br/>\npatience. I&#39;ve seen families grow while the parents lost communication  with the <br/>\nteen and that is sad and nothing to do with unschooling  that&#39;s for sure. <br/>\nI&#39;ve also seen parents do playground after playground full  of toddlers while the <br/>\nteen copes. That sucks.. <br/>\n <br/>\nI hear you on the mom time thing and I&#39;d say if your not willing to let  some <br/>\nof that go during the first year or so I&#39;d reconsider if you want to go  <br/>\nthrough the stages again. My older two were and are easier then the second two.  <br/>\nMy 4 yr old is very sensitive when he gets tired/food triggers so that is  <br/>\nsomething we work around. The 2 yr old is my longest bf&#39;ing baby and I AP&#39;d  with <br/>\nhim the first 1yr 1/2. That requires/ed me to be there for him much  more than <br/>\nthe last 3. He nursed nearly nonstop the first 15 months and we  co-sleep. <br/>\nSleep is my trigger so co-sleeping a BF&#39;ing baby was bliss to me  as are late <br/>\nnights after he&#39;s sleeping.<br/>\nI needed to be creative to be there for all my kids and I did/am. Just  <br/>\nbusier at times..<br/>\n <br/>\nI personally don&#39;t have a cap on how many children we have though I do  know <br/>\nit&#39;s challenging for me to do things like conventions and  appointments. We <br/>\nhave been able to make it all happen but not without a little  creativity. <br/>\nUnschooling helped that&#39;s for sure..<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I wasn&#39;t unschooling I may not know my children as deeply as I do. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think how many children one has matters though I do see the parents  <br/>\npatience and style as being major.<br/>\nUnschooling seems to me to be perfect for a larger family who is open  to <br/>\neach child being their own person.<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\nUnschoolingMaine.com <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5895,"nextTopicId":14492}}
