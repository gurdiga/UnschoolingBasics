My old self would have been screaming at the kids to clean up their rooms, etc.  My youngest said to me, I am really tired and I don&#39;t want to help, which once again could have turned into me screaming.  NOPE, I said ok, the kids went outside to play.  I did what I could.  Mostly the house did not get clean, but the earth did not fall off it&#39;s axis because the house did not get cleaned.  Life is just too short for me to be screaming and freaking out over things like that.

These are individually<br/>\nfoil-wrapped wet wipes for teeth that have xylitol in them.  My younger ones<br/>\nchew them like gum and then spit them out; she could wrap one around her<br/>\nfinger or chew it.  The great thing about these is you can carry them around<br/>\nwith you - she can clean her teet whenever she gets the urge.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe can also rinse her mouth with a baking soda or xylitol wash, instead of<br/>\nbrushing.  Some foods, such as cheese, are good for teeth.  She can chew<br/>\nxylitol gum or eat xylitol mints (www.xylitolnow.com,<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,\">http://homesteadmarket.com/about.html,</a> or www.xlear.com have good products).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked how we handle it:  half of our family (my sons and I) have the<br/>\nstrep mutans bacteria that causes early childhood caries (ECC).  Early<br/>\nChildhood Caries (ECC) is the most infectious disease among children younger<br/>\nthan five and is usually transmitted by a parent or caregiver (by biting a<br/>\npiece of food and giving it to the child).  My sons both had partial bridges<br/>\nby the time they were two.  By the time my youngest was two, he had 6 teeth<br/>\npulled and had two lower molar crowns.  I could visibly see the teeth<br/>\ndissolving over a two week period and could see a HOLE through one of his<br/>\nmolars.  I brush, floss, and still was going in for a cavity repair every<br/>\nmonth or two, and have 4 root canals and a couple additional crowns.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the changes we made was to brush before instead of after eating.  The<br/>\nbacteria must come in contact with sugar or carbohydrates to acidify; even<br/>\nbrushing immediately after eating allows the bacteria to acidify.  By<br/>\nbrushing before eating one removes the bacterial plaque, which takes<br/>\ntwenty-four hours to recolonize. We also eat foods to remineralize our teeth<br/>\nand take cod liver oil, and use xylitol toothpaste and products.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest has not had a single cavity in two years.  One eye tooth that<br/>\nhad begun calcifying when we made our changes - has not progressed AT ALL<br/>\ninto any decay (I have an explorer and check for sticky spots).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do not have any resistance to tooth brushing, is just part of our routine<br/>\nlike washing hands after using the bathroom.  We keep toothbrushes in the<br/>\nkitchen, the bathroom, and the car, for convenience (there is no adult<br/>\nlooming over them - sometimes we feel our teeth are fuzzy and are too busy<br/>\nto go to the bathroom to brush them - kitchen is then more handy).  My boys<br/>\nwould much rather brush their teeth than have emergency extractions for<br/>\nteeth that have broken off at the gumline (this happened to my youngest and<br/>\nwas probably the most agonizing parenting moment I have ever gone through;<br/>\nwith the other son his top four teeth broke in half after a fall onto<br/>\ncarpet).  For my boys, they lay on the bed at night and &quot;mommy robot&quot; brings<br/>\nthe robot brush - or they are frozen and the tooth brush unfreezes them -<br/>\nwhatever game they invent, I will do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see there are numerous alternatives to actually brushing, I hope<br/>\none of these works for you and your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.488 / Virus Database: 269.14.4/1057 - Release Date: 10/8/2007<br/>\n9:04 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do y&#39;all handle teeth brushing!!!","postDate":"1191880910","msgId":26915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM1Mi4yMjVkNzM5OS4zNDNjMDJjZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26912,"nextInTopic":26916,"prevInTime":26914,"nextInTime":26916,"topicId":26899,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/8/2007 10:07:10 A.M.

Tooth rot has more to do with a genetic roll of<br/>\nthe dice than care.   I am 36 yrs old and have on paper taken horrible care<br/>\nof my teeth.  As a child I did not brush for MONTHS.  Even now, I do not<br/>\nbrush twice a day (mostly because I have mouth ulcers and at times it&#39;s too<br/>\npainful to brush.)  I have NO cavities.  No rot, no periodontal disease.<br/>\nBoth my brothers take much better care of their teeth but they have tons of<br/>\nfillings.  I really think it&#39;s just a matter of chance.  So as uptight as I<br/>\nam about everything else still &lt;bg&gt; on tooth brushing I sort of leave it<br/>\nalone.  I remind every now and again &quot;Hey, have you brushed your teeth<br/>\nlately?&quot;  But I don&#39;t ever bug them about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can give other things a try...toothbrushes that make music, light up,<br/>\nbubblegum toothpaste.  Offer different options perhaps.  Also gauze on a<br/>\nfinger tip works too.  Not as good as a brushing but better than nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to comment at all on the &quot;shoulds&quot; or &quot;coulds&quot; really since<br/>\nI&#39;m too new at this.  I just wanted to put your mind at ease about the rot.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/8/07, kellmar98 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellmar98@...\">kellmar98@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   My 7 year old HATES brushing her teeth.
