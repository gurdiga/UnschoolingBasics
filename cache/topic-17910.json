Taking time to BE with your kids.  Reading them stories,<br/>\ntaking them to the park and the library and the zoo and to see<br/>\ngrandma.  Recognizing their interests and continuing to pursue those<br/>\nwith them.  You don&#39;t have to DO schoolwork with them.  They are going<br/>\nto learn, trust that.  There is no preschool curriculum in<br/>\nUNschooling.  There is nothing special that is required to let them be<br/>\ntoddlers.  Just let them be kids!  Enjoy them.
