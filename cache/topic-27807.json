I think<br/>\nyou are feeling the rut more than she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not in NYC, but here are some ideas that may or<br/>\nmay not apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the library. They often have story-time for<br/>\ntoddlers.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuseums that have hands-on stuff are good as are zoos.<br/>\nBut both were often not worth the money when my kids<br/>\nwere little. They were perfectly happy seeing ducks<br/>\nand geese at nearby ponds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids enjoyed playing with playdoh and finger<br/>\npaints. And bath tub crayons. And bubble baths<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Britt Pastor &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:spirithouse@...\">spirithouse@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey all,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m the single mom of a sunny, sociable,<br/>\n&gt; amazing-as-all-heck two year old<br/>\n&gt; girl.
