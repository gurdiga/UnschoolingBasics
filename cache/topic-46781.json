It means she can&#39;t do arithmetic in her head, see the beautiful patterns in math and visualize multistep operations to make sense of them. She memorized a couple of isolated tricks like how to figure a restaurant tip but she simply can&#39;t understand why they work in any larger context of math competence. She never could have passed the most basic school math &quot;opportunity&quot; nor score even passably on any standardized tests like SAT, ACT, community college placement and the GRE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; School or some other cultural meme sets up an idea that Every opportunity Has To be grabbed with both hands right now.

Also math as a school subject teaches everyone to find the same right answers or else fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Meredith&#39;s advice applies to math-through-algebra required by school curriculum even done at home by well-meaning parents -- for my daughter it would have interfered with everything wonderful to force that &quot;opportunity&quot; on her.

Sometimes that means they say no to &quot;good opportunities&quot; but that doesn&#39;t have to be a dead-end or failure.

That&#39;s one of those truisms that can get you into a lot of trouble. Nudging leads pretty frequently to kids who either resist being nudged blindly, and/or follow it blindly. Kids used to being nudged can resit parental nudging only to turn around and respond to peer nudging - and its easy to see a lot of stereotypical teenage behavior in that light. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want my kids to feel secure in their own ability to make decisions - but for them to do that, they need to actually make some.

Occasionally she doesn&#39;t want to go, but reminding her of her favorite things like her friends and learning to swim faster get her really excited to go again. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it sounds like you are putting pressure on him as if you were I think especially as a 13yo he would be fighting back if you were.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope he has fun whatever he decides!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n--<br/>\n206-351-5748<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.KristinBennett.com\">http://www.KristinBennett.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 3, 2011, at 7:52 PM, &quot;Michele&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michelewith3@...\">michelewith3@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi All, <br/>\n&gt; I have been a lurker for a long while and now have a question. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Should/Can I encourage my son to try something without seeming like I trying to talk him into it or coerce him. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The background is my 13 (almost 14) year old son won a HUGE annual science competition that is state wide. the winning team, in each age group, goes for a week long stay at the Wrigley Marine Institute on Catalina Island.

Then I&#39;m left managing my own disappointment, which<br/>\nsometimes leads me to try to push/encourage, and truthfully, it never<br/>\nworks.  Maybe part of letting your son make his decision is realizing that<br/>\nYOU are sad about possibly missing this opportunity, you are mourning the<br/>\nloss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to over and over again try to see the world as a four year old, not<br/>\nas an adult.  As an adult I can see a lot of the advantages and<br/>\ndisadvantages, weigh them, and I&#39;m in a mature enough place to tolerate<br/>\nsome bad in order to have some good.  I think kids often can&#39;t see those<br/>\nnuances, but that&#39;s okay.  It&#39;s where they are and if we start imposing<br/>\nour own judgements and values onto an experience we lose respect for their<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how to assist kids reaching outside their comfort zone.  Finn<br/>\nis a cautious kid and has a very well established comfort zone and a lot<br/>\nof confidence about maintaining it.  When I push it does not help him.  I<br/>\nhave had to let go and let him come to things on his own.  And when he<br/>\ndoes, it&#39;s beautiful because he&#39;s SO proud of himself and SO happy.  But<br/>\nuntil then it&#39;s very hard to step back and I hope it will become easier<br/>\nwith some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only practical suggestion I can come up with is to model stepping out<br/>\nof your comfort zone yourself.  Be honest when something is hard, scary,<br/>\nuncomfortable for you to do.  Take on new things you may not have.

I love to do all sorts of things though had very little chance growing up to really excel and be offered such opportunities. Since it seems like you&#39;ve approached this being respectful with him and listening I think one of the questions if it were me (as the mom) would probably be Would he benefit in knowing the background of my excitement? I think &quot;having an agenda&quot; isn&#39;t a horrible thing. It&#39;s a part of who I am that I can&#39;t help bring with me as a person and now a parent. Historically this &quot;agenda&quot; has often been hidden from myself. As time has goes on I learn more and more about this. Often others see it in me before I do which can be helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are pretty interested in others experiences including my own. I end up managing the telling of  my experiences differently for each of my kids depending on the topic/issue at hand. My 12 year old daughter is very cautious about being out of her bounds, so to speak. She has a comfort level that in order to cross over she must talk about all the possible scenarios. At times like these I can sometimes share my experience via imagining with her what things might look and feel like. I think my own story means more to her in this context because of it being delivered with a similar weight as the other imaginings. Plus she knows I&#39;ve been on the planet almost 4 times longer than her and believes me. I think imagining together is very exciting and hopeful. <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks ago this same daughter was invited (last minute  she hates last minute) to go with her grammy and pa to their &quot;special house&quot;, their summer home, for a few days. This was so overwhelming to her, which I expected. But I also knew that there was a decent chance that if she went with them she would not regret it. I did not push her nor just let her go as in decide completely on her own. I really wanted her to go but did not even come close to saying that to her. I flowed with her thoughts and questions and added my responses and thought/imaginings as if I were her, sort of...i mean as if it were me in her position and feelings. That&#39;s funny to think of now. But I knew there were going to be plenty of other opportunities like this and made sure to convey that I wasn&#39;t attached to if she did or didn&#39;t go without exactly saying those words. When she does want me to tell her what she should do in situations like this I tell her she has to decide. In this case she decided to go even though she has trouble with the decision right up until leaving. She was so happy she went! She had a great time! I suppose has a few things been different up there she may have not had a good time or she may have had mixed feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo obviously I don&#39;t know you, your son or the dynamic between you beyond how I take what you&#39;ve said but I think you care deeply and that&#39;s inspiring to me and ultimately to him. I don&#39;t think there is a right or wrong decision. Your interchange with him with your caring, honest sensibilities are what can be of value to him the most down the line. I&#39;d love to know what he decides and how it goes!!<br/>\n<br/>\n~joanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michele&quot; &lt;michelewith3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi All, <br/>\n&gt; I have been a lurker for a long while and now have a question. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Should/Can I encourage my son to try something without seeming like I trying to talk him into it or coerce him. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The background is my 13 (almost 14) year old son won a HUGE  annual science competition that is state wide. the winning team, in each age group, goes for a week long stay at the Wrigley Marine Institute on Catalina Island.

They do amazing things - study with the scientists, kayaking, campfires - oh all kinds of fun stuff (my opinion I understand). So ds doesn&#39;t really want to go. Sort of apathetic. He says he will go if I want him to but he would prefer not to. His team mates are all going and they are pretty good friends.  We talked about trying it for a few days and coming home ANYtime he wants. There are ferries that we can arrange. He has been away from home many times so it isn&#39;t fear in that area. We are both introverts so i made sure there is down time... i think i covered all the concerns. <br/>\nSo, the real question is, how do I encourage him with out seeming like I am pushing him? Or do I let it go? I am thinking he might not realize all the cool stuff there will be to do. He says that yes, some of it sounds cool but there is a lot he doesn&#39;t care about. Kind of like the price for the cool stuff is too high. <br/>\nSo I let it go right? <br/>\n(sorry for not proofreading - he is supposed to leave in 2 days and I am hoping to get some opinions right away.  all this time I was assuming he was going until a couple days ago when he groaned at the mention of it and  I asked him)<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46776,"nextTopicId":46813}}
