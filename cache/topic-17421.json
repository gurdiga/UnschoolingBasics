When","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-979724328\">***How is this NOT coersive parenting? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling seems so radical to some people maybe it&#39;s surprising to find <br/>\nour kids look like other kids. &lt;g&gt;  When you saw a little boy in a dinosaur <br/>\nshirt why did *you* assume dinosaurs were gender specific?<br/>\nI&#39;m just teasing you a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our kids are little we make decisions for them similar to decisions we <br/>\nmake for ourselves about dress or food or personal hygiene.   It wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\npractical to do otherwise.  It&#39;s not reasonable to expect a newborn to <br/>\nanswer questions about clothing preference.   As our kids get older and know <br/>\nmore about what is available to them they have more to choose from.   If you <br/>\nhave gender specific ideas about clothing you&#39;ll choose according to your <br/>\nown preference for your kids until they&#39;re making their own choices.   Some <br/>\nof the parents of the kids you saw might have bought what was on sale.  Some <br/>\nmight have shopped at the thrift store where selection was limited.   Some <br/>\nmight have received clothes from friends or siblings whose children had <br/>\noutgrown them.   Some kids might have chosen their clothes.  I don&#39;t think a <br/>\nfew photos can lead to the conclusion unschooled children are coerced into <br/>\nwearing gender specific clothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf both parents eat meat they probably include meat in the foods they offer <br/>\ntheir children.  If both parents are vegetarian their little kids probably <br/>\nare too.<br/>\nIt would be impossible and impractical to make every food item available to <br/>\nour kids everyday.  We offer what we have, what we prefer and as our kids <br/>\ngrow and develop preferences we&#39;re mindful of those.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were at my mom&#39;s house a couple days ago and I made a bowl of quickie <br/>\nnoodles for Dylan.  They were some brand he&#39;d never had before and I told <br/>\nhim if he didn&#39;t like them I&#39;d make him something else.   My mom said, &quot;If <br/>\nyou don&#39;t like it, eat it anyway.&quot;   She said that&#39;s what she used to tell <br/>\nher kids.<br/>\nIt&#39;s true, she did and she&#39;s old and crazy now.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents offer what is available and should make available what <br/>\nis preferred.  (or end up like my mother)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17414,"nextTopicId":17419}}
