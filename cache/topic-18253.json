It&#39;s not a big deal, I  <br/>\njust say how I like to do a little tidy as a present to dad, who&#39;s  <br/>\nworked really hard all day. They usually love to join in, although  <br/>\nlately Emily has gotten grumpy if Josh chooses not to help. We all do  <br/>\na little at a time, at our house, just putting your dishes in the  <br/>\ndishwasher after a meal makes a big difference, as you can imagine  <br/>\nwith nine people that&#39;s a lot of dishes to do by yourself AND it&#39;s  <br/>\noverwhelming to see in a sink. We also have to be careful because  <br/>\nAvari is so small, so chokehazards can&#39;t get left out, but they don&#39;t  <br/>\nmind cleaning as a gift to Avari for her freedom. ;-) Otherwise she&#39;s  <br/>\nin the sling all the time to keep her off the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso wanted to say that a supported three year old can do a lot more  <br/>\nthan most imagine. Dan loves to wash dishes by hand, and if I draw up  <br/>\na sink of water, he&#39;ll do most of them, fairly well. Even if he gets  <br/>\nbored, as Kelly said, soaking helps it go faster if I get some time  <br/>\nto myself (ha! like that happens). When Josh was very small and I was  <br/>\npregnant, he wanted to help in the worst way, so he would clean with  <br/>\nbaby wipes, and love it. SO all of our kids have joined in cleaning  <br/>\nwith wipies, and as they got older begged to use sprayers and towels  <br/>\nrather than wipies. Lots of baskets to put clothes and toys in, every  <br/>\nroom in our house has baskets, even though the same stuff is out,  <br/>\nbeing contained makes a big difference and takes so little of my  <br/>\ntime, usually two minutes when I&#39;m on the way to the bathroom or to  <br/>\nget a drink of water.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I gotta go.

Dh is bothered a lot more. It was a<br/>\nmajor source of conflict when the kids were small (this was before we were<br/>\nunschooling so I can&#39;t blame it on that!).  Interestingly enough, as I&#39;ve<br/>\nembraced unschooling more, I&#39;ve become more willing to meet him part way on<br/>\nthis. His two things that matter is a made bed and clean socks and underwear<br/>\nin his drawer. I could care less if my bed is made....but it only takes me 1<br/>\nminute to make the bed each day. Throwing a load of clothes in the wash also<br/>\nis quick. If these two things are done, he can tolerate a lot more mess. If<br/>\nthey&#39;re not done, everything else seems worse to him.  And it&#39;s not just<br/>\nhim. My daughter hates a messy kitchen. I&#39;m the one that gets griped at for<br/>\nnot rinsing my dishes or not cleaning up my messes. But because it matters<br/>\nto her, I try to be a little more attentive to the condition of the kitchen.<br/>\nShe has taken on the kitchen as her job to do and she will give it a good<br/>\ncleaning every day or two. In spite of my tolerance of mess and clutter, I<br/>\nreally can&#39;t stand a dirty bathroom. So I make sure it gets cleaned. I don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about any one else doing it.   As we&#39;ve grown more and more into<br/>\nunschooling and as the kids have gotten older,  we all find our little<br/>\nthings we like to do and together, the house stays reasonably clean. Once dh<br/>\nstopped getting annoyed with the condition of the house and making it an<br/>\nissue, I became much more willing to help keep it picked up. The kids are<br/>\nall very good about helping out and they all keep their rooms cleaner than I<br/>\ndo.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-20, Lisa-17, Karl-15, & Ben-11.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/15/06, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marla@...\">marla@...</a> &lt;marla%40nycap.rr.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We are still not on the same page for prioritizing the chores and the<br/>\n&gt; children.

I figured I&#39;d tackle an easy one first!<br/>\n&gt; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A few things: Everyone thinks Ben has always gotten unschooling. We<br/>\n&gt; were *both* new only six years ago, and Ben had some of these same<br/>\n&gt; issues. We&#39;ve about worked through them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If we&#39;re HOMEschooling and HOME all day, why isn&#39;t the house clean?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Uh...because we&#39;re HOME DOing things? And because we&#39;re NOT home doing<br/>\n&gt; OTHER things. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Days we&#39;re home, we&#39;re usually doing all sorts of<br/>\n&gt; crafts/cooking/writing/playing/DOing---busybusybusy! The house gets<br/>\n&gt; trashed when we&#39;re home. I can&#39;t make a mess AND clean at the same<br/>\n&gt; time. How many hours are there in a day?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes we have days that we&#39;re all flying out of the house. We<br/>\n&gt; leave it a wreck, because we can&#39;t tackle anything before we leave.<br/>\n&gt; Then we don&#39;t get home until *after* Ben gets home---no time to pick up<br/>\n&gt; before supper&#39;s due.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the big lightbulbs for Ben was learning (really thinking about<br/>\n&gt; the fact) that each of us is responsible for our feelings about mess.<br/>\n&gt; If a clean toilet *matters* to you, go clean the damned toilet. Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; bitch at someone ELSE to do it. If (in *your* opinion) the dishes<br/>\n&gt; *must* be cleaned, pick up a sponge and get washing! If (*you* feel)<br/>\n&gt; the floor needs vacuuming, well..... The things that bother us should<br/>\n&gt; bother *us* enough to do something about them *ourselves*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the *other* hand: I would ask him what TWO things really, really<br/>\n&gt; bother him. What TWO things could *I* do that would make a difference<br/>\n&gt; to him on a daily basis. 1) clean house and 2) clean yard would NOT<br/>\n&gt; qualify! &lt;G&gt; But if having my &quot;piles&quot; picked up or having the beds made<br/>\n&gt; or having the dishes washed or having the den straightened would make<br/>\n&gt; *Ben* happy to walk through the door, I would make sure THOSE TWO<br/>\n&gt; things are done each day. And DON&#39;T do them so he won&#39;t yell when he<br/>\n&gt; walks through the door. DO them because it makes him happy! Because it<br/>\n&gt; makes a difference in his life. Change the dynamics in the house!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Something to keep in mind is that we need to treat our husbands as<br/>\n&gt; nicely as we treat our kids. We also need to remember that our husbands<br/>\n&gt; are *ALSO* doing the best they can with the tools that they have right<br/>\n&gt; now! Maybe Ken has very few tools. Help him acquire new ones. Helpful,<br/>\n&gt; useful ones. Yelling ISN&#39;T helpful or useful! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These dads (mostly the dads---Deb R&#39;s her family&#39;s breadwinner!) are<br/>\n&gt; the ones that make this unschooling lifestyle we love so much even<br/>\n&gt; remotely possible. Without their continued support, we couldn&#39;t DO<br/>\n&gt; this! Taking a bit more care to make *his* life as special as you can<br/>\n&gt; will make him feel welcome and special in his own home. I&#39;d put as much<br/>\n&gt; effort into that as possible. Ask the girls for their help too. The<br/>\n&gt; better HE is treated, the better HE will respond. Make him *want* to<br/>\n&gt; come home!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Check out the new AOL.
