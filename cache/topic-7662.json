I was sitting nearby in case anything needed clarification (how<br/>\nmuch to remove, etc). The beautician asked DS how old he was so he<br/>\nanswered 7. Then the obvious next question What grade are you in? He<br/>\nsaid &quot;we homeschool&quot; as if that sums it all up. So she turned to me<br/>\n(as we had been chatting here and there) and said &quot;So you teach him?&quot;<br/>\nand I said (pleasant smile on my face, wicked grin in my mind) &quot;Nope&quot;<br/>\nand she said &quot;Oh&quot; and went back to cutting hair (I could tell she was<br/>\nconfused). In other times and other places this usually leads to more<br/>\ndiscussion but there just wasn&#39;t the time or interest this time.<br/>\n--Deb  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is great!  We have had lots of people ask our kids what grade <br/>\nthey are in and they just give them this blank look and then turn to <br/>\nme like &quot;What grade am I supposed to be in?&quot;  I usually respond <br/>\nwith &quot;We don&#39;t do the grade thing.&quot;  Now that they are getting older <br/>\nthey know what grade they would be in if they were in school and they <br/>\nusually will say &quot;If I was in public school I would be in the __ <br/>\ngrade.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest son was telling me last night that the parents of his two <br/>\nbest friends, that attend public school, have been asking him lots of <br/>\nquestions about unschooling.  Apparently he gives really good answers <br/>\nbecause Kevin said that both parents wish they could have that for <br/>\ntheir kids.  The one would unschool her daughter but the daughter <br/>\nreally likes her school and her friends there and can&#39;t picture what <br/>\nshe would do if she was home.  Says she would be bored.  Obviously <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really understand that she could do ANYTHING!!  The other one <br/>\nis a single mom who has to work.  I thought it was wonderful though <br/>\nthat the parents are so supportive of how we live and what Kevin is <br/>\ndoing.  They aren&#39;t your typical parents though, they aren&#39;t <br/>\ncontrolling, coercive parents like so many.  I guess that is why Kevin <br/>\ncan still relate to some degree because they are really good kids that <br/>\nhave managed to keep their unique selves uncrushed by the public <br/>\nschool system.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7590,"nextTopicId":7655}}
