When I happen to meet one, I am always way off! Last  <br/>\nsemester, I met with a student that I had been assuming was straight  <br/>\nout of high school. A good writer, but something about her name and  <br/>\nthings she had said made me think she was very young. Was I surprised  <br/>\nwhen a 45-year-old woman showed up to our meeting!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis semester, I had an excellent student, a forceful and eloquent  <br/>\nwriter. I teach argumentative writing, and she had no trouble taking  <br/>\na stand. One of my few students who has earned a pure 4.0 on the  <br/>\nbasis of her writing. She dropped by my office to pick up her final  <br/>\nportfolio, and she was this slender wisp of a thing--98 pounds  <br/>\ndripping wet--with a voice that sounded like she&#39;d been inhaling  <br/>\nhelium. I commented on what a good writer she was, and she said, &quot;oh,  <br/>\num, huh, do you really think so &lt;giggle&gt;, I guess so.&quot; Never met my  <br/>\neyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. The community college students I teach every semester are reason  <br/>\nnumber 1427 why we homeschool. I see the product of the public  <br/>\nschools every day! Also, the way the occasional homeschooled student  <br/>\nstands out. I have rarely had a weak writer among homeschooled  <br/>\nstudents, though I have had a couple who seemed to lack a broad  <br/>\nperspective, like the one who wrote an argument about homeschooling  <br/>\nthat assumed homeschooling meant following a curriculum, mailing work  <br/>\noff to a teacher who graded it and sent it back, and so on. But the  <br/>\npublic school students also tend to have huge gaps, and combine them  <br/>\nwith very weak skills as well. I had a publicly-schooled student once  <br/>\nwho had never heard of the Civil War. I thought she was putting me on  <br/>\n(&quot;Wait,&quot; she said. &quot;There was a war here?&quot;) but she wasn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always interesting to get an argument about homeschooling. One  <br/>\nof my students wrote an argument this semester about Michigan needing  <br/>\ntighter regulation of homeschoolers (we live in Michigan). When they  <br/>\nwrite about something I know a lot about and have a strong opinion  <br/>\nabout, I have to carefully step back not to rip their argument to  <br/>\nshreds but to judge it by the standards of a freshman writing class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I off-topic enough yet? Or should I try harder &lt;smile&gt;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI taught a face-to-face class this semester for the first time in  <br/>\nyears. I had forgotten how passively they sit there, how little  <br/>\neffort they make to meet me halfway, how completely they expect to be  <br/>\nentertained and educated with little or no effort on their part. It  <br/>\ncan be like doing a comedy routine to a hostile audience; very  <br/>\ndraining. And the younger ones don&#39;t realize they are making a choice  <br/>\nto be in college, so they continue to behave like they&#39;re under  <br/>\ncompulsion. They won&#39;t do any assignment that is worth less than 10%  <br/>\nof their final grade because they think it won&#39;t matter. I can&#39;t tell  <br/>\nyou how many times this semester I showed up to teach a 4-hour course  <br/>\n(a once-a-week evening class) to find that maybe 2 of them had done  <br/>\nthe prep work I requested, so that we weren&#39;t able to do what I had  <br/>\nplanned and I had to improvise for four hours! If I ask them to do in- <br/>\nclass work, they dash off something inadequate in five minutes so  <br/>\nthey can go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like my students as people. As students, not so much.
