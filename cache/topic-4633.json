I am a single mom to a seven <br/>\nyear old son who is currently attending a public school. I am very <br/>\ninterested in unschooling and have been readings and learning for <br/>\nprobably about 1.5 years. I certainly appreciate all the information <br/>\nhere...it has been valuable to me and my thought processes although <br/>\nwe are not unschooling as of yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I tentatively brought the subject up of unschooling our son <br/>\nto my ex-husband and as usual we really had a non-productive <br/>\nconversation about it. He and I have never communicated well together <br/>\n(hence the ex part ;) ) and for many reasons I find it very hard to <br/>\nexpress clearly and concisely my feelings and thoughts to him. He <br/>\nalso tends to belittle my thoughts and ideas... so my plea to you all <br/>\nis for some suggestions of places to send him and things to <br/>\nread/websites about unschooling for the sceptical/unsure. I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally want to hit him too hard with radical unschooling things at <br/>\nthis point, but move a bit more gently toward explaining it all in a <br/>\nway that he may even begin to learn about it. He&#39;s quite &quot;schooly&quot;, <br/>\nwe both were excellent students and went on to MIT, but while he had <br/>\na good experience, mine was miserable. So we are coming from opposite <br/>\nexperiences and outlooks on life in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI start with that and hope that you can help me a bit.<br/>\nLater I may get to the question of how to unschool as a single mom...<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nKendra in MA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4606,"nextTopicId":4635}}
