I must have given the wrong impression here.  I was saying that I actually think both myspace and facebook (especially) are safer than the one site we had found designed for kids under 13.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not afraid of safety issues for my daughter.  She knows she can come to me if there is anything online (or anywhere) that makes her uncomfortable or feel unsafe. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know any under 13&#39;s on facebook.

THIS is what I was worried about.  Not because I&#39;m afraid of some ficitional person who might &quot;get&quot; her but because we are both worried that she will enjoy it and then get kicked off.  And also because neither of us want her to have to continue to lie.  We DO know people who have been kicked off sites for being underage. This is why I posted.  To get other peoples opinions and hear others experiences. I don&#39;t know tons of people who have been kicked off.  I&#39;m very happy to hear that many here have not had that issue.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did and happily.

That is another reason why we are exploring options for other sites because she has a need to connect with others her age online but most of her friends aren&#39;t allowed to spend much time online and certainly not on facebook or myspace.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure of other options.

I would love to &quot;start&quot; something for the tween and younger kids but that seems to be a little out of my scope.  At least the kind of site we are looking for :).  We have been looking for other sites.  It seems they are few and far between or as I stated before poorly run and more unsafe than I&#39;ve found sites geared for older kids.

She is very interested in social networking <br/>\nonline…chatting, forums, sites like myspace and face book etc.  We <br/>\nhave had a VERY hard time finding places for her to do this that <br/>\nallow users under 13 (per their terms of service).  The places we <br/>\nhave found just don&#39;t fill the bill.  Most are very difficult to chat <br/>\nin and actually have an actual conversation in for various reasons.  <br/>\nThe one site that we have found seems even MORE unsafe to me than <br/>\nmyspace or face book as there is no way to make the profiles private <br/>\nand no way to  block users that may be harassing you or that just <br/>\nmake you feel uncomfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been very understanding about my hesitancy about this but I&#39;m <br/>\nreally torn about how I feel about it.  On one hand, I get why it is <br/>\nimportant to have those rules in place.  I KNOW that for some, online <br/>\ncan be a pretty unsafe place.  I&#39;m not necessarily bothered by the <br/>\nidea of lying about her age in the registration process because I <br/>\nfeel the rules are very general. However, I also want her to be able <br/>\nto be true to who she is.  If we add two years to her birth date when <br/>\nregistering then she will always have to be pretending to BE 13 or <br/>\nrisk getting kicked off the site.  So, my questions to you all would <br/>\nbe….<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you or would you support your under 13 year old in participating <br/>\nin sites like these and why or why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do to help them meet this need if you didn&#39;t or don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel comfortable with them participating?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am out of ideas about this.

She <br/>\nhas a couple of girls she chats with that I found for her here and <br/>\nshe loves talking to them but that isn&#39;t ALL she is looking for.  <br/>\nAny ideas about this would be appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

She is very interested in social networking <br/>\nonlinechatting, forums, sites like myspace and face book etc.  We <br/>\nhave had a VERY hard time finding places for her to do this that <br/>\nallow users under 13 (per their terms of service).  The places we <br/>\nhave found just don&#39;t fill the bill.  Most are very difficult to chat <br/>\nin and actually have an actual conversation in for various reasons.   <br/>\nThe one site that we have found seems even MORE unsafe to me than <br/>\nmyspace or face book as there is no way to make the profiles private <br/>\nand no way to  block users that may be harassing you or that just <br/>\nmake you feel uncomfortable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has been very understanding about my hesitancy about this but I&#39;m <br/>\nreally torn about how I feel about it.  On one hand, I get why it is <br/>\nimportant to have those rules in place.  I KNOW that for some, online <br/>\ncan be a pretty unsafe place.  I&#39;m not necessarily bothered by the <br/>\nidea of lying about her age in the registration process because I <br/>\nfeel the rules are very general. However, I also want her to be able <br/>\nto be true to who she is.  If we add two years to her birth date when <br/>\nregistering then she will always have to be pretending to BE 13 or <br/>\nrisk getting kicked off the site.  So, my questions to you all would <br/>\nbe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you or would you support your under 13 year old in participating <br/>\nin sites like these and why or why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do to help them meet this need if you didn&#39;t or don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel comfortable with them participating?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am out of ideas about this.  She has been able to hook up with some <br/>\nother kids we know in person to email and chat via email with but <br/>\nthey are mostly restricted in their online time and activities.  She <br/>\nhas a couple of girls she chats with that I found for her here and <br/>\nshe loves talking to them but that isn&#39;t ALL she is looking for.   <br/>\nAny ideas about this would be appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLynda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38518,"nextTopicId":38632}}
