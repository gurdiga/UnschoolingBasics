Without having to go into private details, it was <br/>\nmuch more serious than experimenting. It changed the way we live <br/>\nfrom that day forward.

Two of my children were &quot;experimenting&quot; the other night.  No genital areas were touched, and there was no kissing because, as my 7 yr old put it &quot;I wasn&#39;t comfortable with that&quot;.  (whew!  that&#39;s a good thing!  LOL)  But there was touching and caressing and pecking on other parts of the body.  I asked them about it (in a very non-judgmental way) and my daughter said she wanted to see what it was like to have a boyfriend or a husband.  I explained that while she loved her brother, he couldn&#39;t help her to understand that because he was her brother, and she couldn&#39;t feel for her brother the way she would feel for a boyfriend or a husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is the second time that I&#39;ve found them playing this way, and it makes me apprehensive about them watching anything more than they already see.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else&#39;s children done this?
