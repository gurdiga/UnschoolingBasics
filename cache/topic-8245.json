Your reasons for sending him to <br/>\nschool center around being accepted, but when does school ever help <br/>\nsomeone feel MORE or better when they&#39;re already different?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a Down Syndrome child, but I have cared for Down&#39;s <br/>\nbabies and toddlers in the past, worked with an adult Down&#39;s young <br/>\nadult and volunteered many times with children of various mental <br/>\ndisabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I saw in the Down Syndrome child I babysat regularly, was a <br/>\nsweet, happy, lovely little girl that was surrounded by love....then <br/>\nwent to school and wasn&#39;t as happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf school is not the answer for your other children, why would it <br/>\nsomehow help a young person that has bigger challenges? Why would <br/>\nstrangers know how to help her better than you? What is all this <br/>\ntherapy that has you convinced you need experts to continue, rather <br/>\nthan stimulating this child yourself?<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize Down&#39;s syndrome kids can be hugely challenging in <br/>\ndifferent ways. They are delayed in many areas, but that&#39;s WHO they <br/>\nARE. And we can honor who they are, right now today, by trusting in <br/>\nnatural learning...even for the child that has disabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m no expert on Down&#39;s, but everything I&#39;ve ever seen makes me <br/>\nbelieve that they are  MUCH better off at home, with people that <br/>\nlove them and surrounded by the kind of environment that allows them <br/>\nto simply be who they are. If there is some kind of stimulation that <br/>\nchild needs, I believe with all my heart it can be found outside of <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8179,"nextTopicId":8237}}
