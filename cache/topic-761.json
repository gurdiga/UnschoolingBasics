While I&#39;m here I might introduce myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Raven and I have three kids: Ted is 6, Kat is 4 and Will is going<br/>\nto be 2 in a matter of a few weeks.<br/>\nTed went to kindergarten at PS last year with a awesome patient, loving<br/>\nteacher and he learned a lot about putting the lids back on markers and<br/>\ncleaning up when you are finished and how to stand in line.  However he did<br/>\nnot learn anything else really, not at her fault just that she had 20 kids<br/>\nand Ted was so far ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nTed is a very touchy kid, and highly sensitive.  We sometimes struggle as<br/>\nparents with this and we decided that since Ted taught himself to read at 2<br/>\n1/2 and loves to learn that this should be the time to cut the school cord<br/>\nand let him loose.  We didn&#39;t want public school to try and &quot;fix&quot; his<br/>\nsensitivity issues.  He loves to hug and touch.  This is one of our biggest<br/>\nthings, he is known to go up to school mates during a T-Ball game for<br/>\nexample and hug them.  Luckily Dad is the coach and can gently remind Ted to<br/>\nget in ready position.  Also luckily for us Ted&#39;s two closest friends are<br/>\nattachment parenting families and understand. He will touch other people<br/>\ninappropriately, like seeing grandma&#39;s breast giggle, or diving under<br/>\nstrangers legs.  I could see him in the hat position very easily.  We also<br/>\nunderstand that it is the touching he craves and often offer to hug him when<br/>\nthese situations arise.  It&#39;s usually not enough because he also seems to<br/>\nfeed off of other people and recharges his batteries to souped up.  We hope<br/>\nhe will outgrow it but for now try to talk to him about things that might<br/>\nmake other people uncomfortable.  An example is that he should ask his<br/>\nfriends if it&#39;s okay to hug them or kiss them first.  He doesn&#39;t  remember<br/>\nunless prompted however.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has other sensitivities also, sound, light, food textures, seeing foods<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t like, clothing, getting wet. I could go on. But to me he is his<br/>\nperfect self and I know school would try to conform all the funny, loving<br/>\nthings he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that your not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&quot;How do you (the collective &quot;you&quot; of the list) tell, or estimate, or what<br/>\n&gt;leads you to believe, that your kids &quot;need&quot; to socialize more?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;Robyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Boy, Ted can let you know when he hasn&#39;t socialized enough, he just gets<br/>\nplain cranky!  And wants to have parental play all day long!  However if we<br/>\ncan get together with our AP group then he is good to build legos on his own<br/>\nfor hours afterwards.  For me it&#39;s trying to figure out what is enough for<br/>\nTed and I.  I don&#39;t craze socialization.  I&#39;m okay without seeing other<br/>\npeople for weeks.  Ted will get stir crazy at the end of a week.  So we<br/>\ncompromise.  Usually we have a large group meeting at a park one day a week<br/>\nand then have a small group of three families that get together another day.<br/>\nIf Ted is still needing to see more people we will go to the library book<br/>\nclub for his age group.  There however we can run into that recharging of<br/>\nhis batteries (or soul)  to such an extreme that his actions are not<br/>\nappropriate for the library so we don&#39;t go on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that was long winded enough.  This seems like a great group.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks Pam...Re: Touchy kid.....","postDate":"1087456055","msgId":786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyOUMxNkZGLUMwMkQtMTFEOC05RjlDLTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNhcjE0MytyaHFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNhcjE0MytyaHFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":785,"nextInTopic":792,"prevInTime":785,"nextInTime":787,"topicId":761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"To everybody who has been reading about Wendy and her touchy kiddo, Lucas --  I was lucky enough to meet them in person today and they are absolutely","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1609833321\">To everybody who has been reading about Wendy and her &quot;touchy&quot; kiddo, <br/>\nLucas --  I was lucky enough to meet them in person today and they are <br/>\nabsolutely DELIGHTFUL.

I have one of my three like that too - she was JUST like him <br/>\nwhen she was five - I could have written just what you did - and she&#39;s <br/>\nnow a ceramicist, knitter, crocheter, and painter.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll have to have a &quot;bag of tricks&quot; to keep him from doing things <br/>\nlike flipping that hat over - you do want him to understand that <br/>\nhandling other people&#39;s things without permission is a bad idea, in <br/>\ngeneral. So - you&#39;ll want to say it - &quot;Luc, don&#39;t handle other people&#39;s <br/>\nthings without permission.&quot;  I mean, that is just a general principal <br/>\nof getting along with other family members, friends, and neighbors and <br/>\nhe deserves to really know that - or people will not like to have him <br/>\naround - now or in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - back to the bag of tricks. I used to literally carry a big bag <br/>\nwith me - not a little purse, but a BIG one - and the reason was that I <br/>\ncarried so many cool things in it - things to keep a kids hands happily <br/>\nbusy for 10 minutes or so. I still carry some things and I&#39;ve helped <br/>\nout other young moms quite a few times - pulled out a little handheld <br/>\ngame for example for their child to fool with for a few minutes while <br/>\nwe had a conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of those kinds of things that people will say, &quot;Talk to him <br/>\nabout it, explain this or that.....&quot; - but if he&#39;s like my oldest <br/>\ndaughter, his touching impulse is too quick and strong - he isn&#39;t <br/>\ncapable of thinking first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - you can&#39;t get discouraged, he&#39;ll eventually learn to keep his <br/>\nhands off and take more care of other people&#39;s property - but you&#39;ll <br/>\nprobably have to keep a far closer eye on him than other people do with <br/>\ntheir kids his age and you&#39;ll need to find a way to do that without <br/>\nbeing resentful of him being like he is (I know, you&#39;re not, I LOVE <br/>\nyour descriptions of him - you always are so careful to see and point <br/>\nout the positive side of his traits).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really wasn&#39;t okay for him to flip that person&#39;s hat over as he <br/>\nwalked by it - and if I had my sunglasses in there (they are $300 <br/>\nprescription sunglasses), I&#39;d have been annoyed, too. You have a <br/>\ndilemma there - because you really can&#39;t watch him and anticipate his <br/>\nevery move - sometimes you&#39;re just going to have to apologize sweetly <br/>\nand move on. But, I would also want to make sure my child knew that the <br/>\nperson was really annoyed by it and that they had a right to be annoyed <br/>\n- I wouldn&#39;t hold out on that information - he needs to know that <br/>\npeople won&#39;t like it if he fools with their things. STILL - no big <br/>\nlecture - just , &quot;Hey, she was mad at you for doing that with her hat - <br/>\nlet&#39;s not touch other people&#39;s things without their permission.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is give him a LOT of opportunity for that kind of <br/>\nphysical sensory input - probably far more than you can imagine he&#39;d <br/>\nwant. Give him opportunities to smash things for example. And put him <br/>\nin the bathtub with a big bowl of pudding and let him paint the tub and <br/>\nhimself with it. He needs soft things and rough things and smooth <br/>\nthings and gooey things and so on - lots and lots of kinds of things to <br/>\nhave his hands on with every texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a habit of playing games with him where you put something in a bag <br/>\nand he reaches in without looking and has to guess what it is. Put <br/>\nkernels of popcorn, rice, feathers, peeled grapes, sand, marbles, and <br/>\nso on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a sandbox? Do you make playdough? Do some kinds of crafts? <br/>\nBuild things with lego, blocks, etc? Build with popsicle sticks and <br/>\nglue - fingerpaint (again - think bathtub for really messy arts and <br/>\ncrafts).<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a giant &quot;touch&quot; book - use strong pages of paper and glue things <br/>\nonto it - you write words like &quot;We went for a walk and found a feather <br/>\n(feather on that page) and a stick (glue stick on that page) and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet him his own tools - real tools that he can handle - hammer,nails, <br/>\nsaw. Help him learn to use them. If he&#39;s not quite ready to hammer <br/>\nnails into wood - get styrofoam and hammer golf tees into it. Kids LOVE <br/>\nto do that.  In fact, chunks of styrofoam and golf tees is something I <br/>\nused to have in my bag of tricks - in plastic baggies - I could pull <br/>\nout a chunk of styrofoam and some brightly colored golf tees and kids <br/>\nwould have fun sticking them into the styrofoam, making patterns, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH - get pattern blocks and geoboards - get two geoboards with colored <br/>\nrubber bands so you can make a pattern and he can try to copy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, geoboards and rubber bands can be in your bag of tricks. So can <br/>\ndice, cards, handheld electronic games, small colored pencil sets with <br/>\na cool pad of paper, gel pens and black paper pads, MAGIC paper - <br/>\nwhatever they call it these days that is black and you scrape it and it <br/>\nis colored underneath,<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to michaels and look at the little craft kits - lace up leather <br/>\npouches, etc. There are so many he could do and you could just keep <br/>\nthem in your purse to pull out when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you give him more and more and more hands-on physical high touch <br/>\nstimulating sensory input kinds of things to do - he&#39;ll find it easier <br/>\nto keep his hands from automatically touching everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of his hands as just CRAVING that sensory input - he needs a lot <br/>\nof it. Don&#39;t just think of depriving him of it when it is not <br/>\nappropriate, think of satisfying it in ways that are appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - you may NOT be able to go stand in a neighbor&#39;s house or yard <br/>\nthat has too many temptations for him - it is only for a few years - <br/>\nyou can sacrifice putting him into those situations - with his needs, <br/>\nit is a sort of set-up for you to do that to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":72521049,"authorName":"Wendy E","from":"&quot;Wendy E&quot; &lt;mommytoluc@...&gt;","profile":"mommytoluc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Touchy kid.....","postDate":"1087405795","msgId":766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhcHV0Myt2M2JxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQS0VORUNNQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":763,"nextInTopic":768,"prevInTime":765,"nextInTime":767,"topicId":761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As I said in my post...we do have these converstations...and I think he understands, he just seems to have a hard time remembering when he is in those","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1461212587\">As I said in my post...we do have these converstations...and I think <br/>\nhe understands, he just seems to have a hard time remembering when he <br/>\nis in those situations....even from minute to minute...ie: he just <br/>\nknocked over the garden gnome....&quot;opps, we need to pick that back <br/>\nup...that&#39;s a decoration they would like to stay there and not get <br/>\nbroken&quot;.....and two minutes later the tennis ball is thrown into the <br/>\nhouse.

Then he starts to walk <br/>\ninto the house without being asked (I don&#39;t know these people really <br/>\nwell...), we follow him in because my neighbor wants to show me some <br/>\nwork they are doing on the house...he starts picking things up from <br/>\nthe table, he turns light switches on and off....we go back outside, <br/>\nback to the chachkis...knocks a little garden gnome over, takes them <br/>\nout fo the ground, picks stones out of a little decorative fountain, <br/>\nhe just touches everything!  This is a common thing for him...he is <br/>\nso curious about his world and just wants to experience it by <br/>\ntouching everything.  All the while this is happening my neighbor and <br/>\nI are saying stuff like &quot;oh, that has to stay there&quot;, &quot;please put <br/>\nthat back&quot;, &quot;look with your eyes&quot; etc...  He&#39;s such an amazing little <br/>\nguy...so interested in the world around him...but when we are in a <br/>\nsocial situation like that I find it very hard to get him to curb his <br/>\nimpulses.  Then I end up getting frustrated because I find the answer <br/>\nis just avoiding those situations altogether (I want to be able to <br/>\nstop and talk to my neighbor for 10 minutes or visit a friend <br/>\netc....)...I should point out that her kids were playing on the patio <br/>\ntoo and Ethan (my 2yo) was with us so it wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t have <br/>\nother people to do things with or even that I wasn&#39;t paying attention <br/>\nto him.  OH, another example of this was the other day when we were <br/>\nat our neighborhood pool club and we were leaving and apparently <br/>\nLucas walked by a chair and saw a hat on it.  He just reached over <br/>\nand picked it up and threw it on the ground and walked on....I didn&#39;t <br/>\nsee this myself.  The woman who&#39;s hat it was, again a neighbor I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know well, ran up to me and (very rudely IMO) told me what had <br/>\nhappened...also pointing out that there was an $80 pair of sunglasses <br/>\nin the hat that she didn&#39;t wish to replace!  I think he just does <br/>\nthings like this because he is not aware.  There is no malicious <br/>\nintent...he just saw the hat and it looked like something fun to flip <br/>\non the floor, KWIM?  We have talks about not touching things that are <br/>\nnot ours....it just seems like the process of understanding this is <br/>\ncoming really slow for him.  It is pretty much the same scenerio when <br/>\nwe go to stores or even when we are at the park, he might just go up <br/>\nto someone else&#39;s blanket and help himself to their snacks...So...I <br/>\nguess the issue here is imparting on him the concept of other <br/>\npeople&#39;s belongings and personal space....any suggestions?  I really <br/>\nwant to honor his curiousity and who he is....but when I go out with <br/>\nhim I have to watch him closer than I watch my 2yo....OK, this is a <br/>\nrambling email...just sort of wanted to cover the realm of things he <br/>\ndoes...I do find myself loosing my patience in these situations <br/>\nsometimes and I would love to find some other ways of dealing with <br/>\nit.  OH, forgot to mention that at the neighbors yesterday he also <br/>\npicked up a tennis ball and threw it inside their open door....Eye-<br/>\nyeye-yeye!<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":767,"nextTopicId":807}}
