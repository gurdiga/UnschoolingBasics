The oldest child is 5 and a little rambunctious anyway.  He is having a difficult time.  I was with him at a park day and he got to hitting at me with a shoe.  It started as playing but I could tell that it was moving to a dark place for him, a place he probably is spending a lot of time these days.  He swung that shoe at me as long as he needed to, I simply blocked it with my arm and kept on talking and joking with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people should take responsibility for being hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Mother Earth (Tyra)&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, February 5, 2006 1:58 pm<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Punishment and rewards<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Pam,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really agree with what you are saying.  I learned early with ds <br/>\n&gt; 1 who is now 5 yrs old that I really had no control over him.  <br/>\n&gt; People used to think I was crazy for saying that but ultimately <br/>\n&gt; children will always choose their behavior because that is what <br/>\n&gt; people do.  However, I can relate to Joyce.  When ds1 was younger, <br/>\n&gt; especially pre-verbal, he would hit me when he was angry.  <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I handled it appropriately and other times I lost it as <br/>\n&gt; I was clueless and shocked that I had a child who hit considering <br/>\n&gt; that I did not hit him.  However, as he got older and had more <br/>\n&gt; words the hitting declined.  But one day I said told him that we <br/>\n&gt; do not relate to one another with hitting.  I told him that I did <br/>\n&gt; not hit him and that I did not want him to hit me because I do not <br/>\n&gt; liked to be hit.  In his face I saw something click, he got it and <br/>\n&gt; stopped hitting.  He is the type of child who I guess is rather <br/>\n&gt; logical and so that approach has worked very well with him.  It is <br/>\n&gt; all about mutual respect<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DS2 is proving to be more challenging in a way.  He hits, too.  It <br/>\n&gt; has bothered me way less this time around because I understand it. <br/>\n&gt; What ds2 is showing me is that the logical approach will not work <br/>\n&gt; for him.  I HATE being hit by my children, and I must admit, <br/>\n&gt; especially in public.  I do feel in a way he is doing what some <br/>\n&gt; children do.  I don&#39;t see his behavior as anti-social or anything <br/>\n&gt; and I am even beginning to realize that often times when he is <br/>\n&gt; sleepy, he is uncontrollable with the hitting and pushing.  I <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know anyone who has experienced a child who hits who can <br/>\n&gt; make me feel comfortable that this will go away in time.  I am at <br/>\n&gt; a place where it is getting crucial for me because he is quickly <br/>\n&gt; moving towards 3 yrs old.  I have to be honest with you all, I <br/>\n&gt; will be damn before  I have a big child hitting me.  It is okay <br/>\n&gt; now that he is little but I am just not going to have it once he <br/>\n&gt; gets older.  Call it conditionings, call it controlling, call me <br/>\n&gt; disrespectful, but I work hard<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I appreciate your input and understanding.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Peace<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tyra <br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt;  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n&gt;  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt;  Sent: Sunday, February 05, 2006 1:07 PM<br/>\n&gt;  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Punishment and rewards<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  So - recognizing that we don&#39;t control them (at least not for <br/>\n&gt; long)  <br/>\n&gt;  is Step 1.

I learned early with ds 1 who is now 5 yrs old that I really had no control over him.  People used to think I was crazy for saying that but ultimately children will always choose their behavior because that is what people do.  However, I can relate to Joyce.  When ds1 was younger, especially pre-verbal, he would hit me when he was angry.  Sometimes I handled it appropriately and other times I lost it as I was clueless and shocked that I had a child who hit considering that I did not hit him.  However, as he got older and had more words the hitting declined.  But one day I said told him that we do not relate to one another with hitting.  I told him that I did not hit him and that I did not want him to hit me because I do not liked to be hit.  In his face I saw something click, he got it and stopped hitting.  He is the type of child who I guess is rather logical and so that approach has worked very well with him.  It is all about mutual respect because I have no problems with him calling me out if do something that infringes on his respect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDS2 is proving to be more challenging in a way.  He hits, too.  It has bothered me way less this time around because I understand it.  What ds2 is showing me is that the logical approach will not work for him.  I HATE being hit by my children, and I must admit, especially in public.  I do feel in a way he is doing what some children do.  I don&#39;t see his behavior as anti-social or anything and I am even beginning to realize that often times when he is sleepy, he is uncontrollable with the hitting and pushing.  I don&#39;t know anyone who has experienced a child who hits who can make me feel comfortable that this will go away in time.  I am at a place where it is getting crucial for me because he is quickly moving towards 3 yrs old.  I have to be honest with you all, I will be damn before  I have a big child hitting me.  It is okay now that he is little but I am just not going to have it once he gets older.  Call it conditionings, call it controlling, call me disrespectful, but I work hard to be a loving parent, and I am one who really has to WORK HARD.  I have control and anger issues that I work to transform everyday so that I am a loving and available mother.  So, in a way I think that as he gets older, he is going to have to express himself in a different way because I am getting to a place where I am growing weary.  He is little still and I am dealing with it.  I have even tried to soften him down during those times by giving him loving and nursing him.  I guess what I am wanting to know from others who understand and/or have experience with this, will he grow out of it as he gets more verbal?  He is slower with coming into his speech than my older son.  Or what internal process can I tap into to help me better understand so that I can help my son express himself differently?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your input and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\n<br/>\nTyra <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, February 05, 2006 1:07 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Punishment and rewards<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So - recognizing that we don&#39;t control them (at least not for long)  <br/>\n  is Step 1.

One is <br/>\nthe goal to have the child take some time until they&#39;re feeling more <br/>\nsocial; the other is (maybe) to teach the child the lesson that they <br/>\nneed to be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first goal, imo, is not a misdirected goal--if a person is feeling <br/>\ngrumpy or cranky, then being in a less social situation is likely a good <br/>\nplan. I do that when I&#39;m feeling grumpy for whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue arises, as I see it anyway, when goal one gets coupled with <br/>\ngoal two. The second goal is what, imo, makes the action &quot;go to your <br/>\nroom&quot; punitive. It turns a natural social conflict into a situation of <br/>\npower and punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my dh is feeling grumpy, the best solution for the family is for him <br/>\nto own that grumpiness and either make an emotional shift or to go putz <br/>\naround in the barn, chop wood, or engage in some other solitary activity <br/>\nrather than pick fights with those around him. Let&#39;s face it, we all <br/>\nhave those grumpy moments when we are likely to grump at people around <br/>\nus and pick fights even (and sometimes especially) with those we love. <br/>\nWhen I&#39;m feeling really pms-y, I try to realize that right away--observe <br/>\nit and know it about myself--and honor that feeling at the same time I <br/>\nhonor my relationships. I&#39;ll say to my kids that I&#39;m feeling grumpy, <br/>\nthat I&#39;m choosing to clean or garden or whatever so that I don&#39;t grump <br/>\nat them, and I tell them where I&#39;ll be if they need me. I&#39;ll try to take <br/>\nsome solitary time to honor my own feelings and move through them, so <br/>\nthat I feel more available to family members at other times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s a really long-winded way of saying that in our family the <br/>\ngoal is to help our kids do this same thing--recognize and honor their <br/>\nown feelings while at the same time respecting and preserving our <br/>\nrelationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times when I&#39;ve gently removed one of my children from a <br/>\nspace, but the goal has always been to help them honor and process their <br/>\nemotions in a space that&#39;s conducive to that and respectful to the other <br/>\nmembers of the household. So, when I remove one of my children or gently <br/>\nsuggest they go to a safe space and offer to go with them, the goal is <br/>\nto help them process their strong feelings, not to make them stop having <br/>\nthose strong feelings or to isolate them if that&#39;s not a choice they&#39;d <br/>\nlike to make. I&#39;m there to be with them, comfort them, maintain a calm <br/>\npresence in the face of their intense emotion, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it *is* important to do this in a way that respects other family <br/>\nmember&#39;s right to space. But that&#39;s not to say that the child&#39;s room is <br/>\nthe only space where this can happen. It could be my room, the computer <br/>\nroom, outside on the trampoline, where ever they can take the space and <br/>\ntime they need to express and move through their emotion. If I had an <br/>\nonly child, I imagine that I&#39;d do a lot more of this honoring within the <br/>\nspace we were in. But, because I have three children, honoring the <br/>\nintense emotion often coincides with removing ourselves to a different <br/>\nspace.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I believe makes this non-punitive is my willingness to accompany <br/>\nthe child, so it does not amount to love withdrawal, to borrow Alfie <br/>\nKohn&#39;s term, and the fact that the child controls when s/he feels ready <br/>\nto rejoin the social space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best measure of punitive/ non-punitive is to measure our own <br/>\nbehavior with a child versus how we would behave with a spouse or a <br/>\nfriend. If I had a friend who was bereaved or angry and chose to express <br/>\nthat in very verbal and public ways, I would gently and persuasively <br/>\nattempt to get that person out of that public space and to a more <br/>\nprivate space as quickly and quietly as possible. So, too, if my husband <br/>\nseems grumpy or becomes particularly angry do I try to persuade him to <br/>\nremove himself as gently and respectfully as possible, though I&#39;m also <br/>\nnot adverse to putting myself less-tactfully between my dh and my <br/>\nchildren in much the same way I&#39;d stand between a dear friend and harm&#39;s <br/>\nway.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsciously and carefully thinking through actions with my children and <br/>\nmeasuring them against the yardstick of how I might behave with an equal <br/>\nhas been an invaluable tool in my own journey in respectful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (7), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Punishment and rewards","postDate":"1139102770","msgId":9792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA5NEVBQjFBLTc2OUQtNDE0Ni1CMEU1LUNEQjJEOUZFRjBCNkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRzMmxidis1YWRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRzMmxidis1YWRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9790,"nextInTopic":9795,"prevInTime":9791,"nextInTime":9793,"topicId":9756,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The single greatest tool I&#39;ve found for being in long <br/>\nlines or difficult standing still (relatively speaking) and waiting <br/>\nsituations with young kids is &quot;Simon Says.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy three will happily play &quot;Simon Says,&quot; something we never play at <br/>\nhome, while waiting in a really long line.

Always has. I&#39;ve spent a<br/>\nlot of time saying, &quot;Jalen, that&#39;s hurting my ears, could you talk<br/>\nlower?&quot; Or &quot;Can you use a voice like this (as I&#39;m talking softer) so I<br/>\ncan listen better?&quot;<br/>\nHe really is starting to catch himself now and honor my need for a<br/>\ngentler voice (he just turned five) I try to save that request for<br/>\nwhen I really need it.

Maybe you<br/>\ncould explain what the problem with movement is in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the wiggling is something other people give you strange<br/>\nlooks for. But as long as Jalen isn&#39;t truly harming anything or<br/>\ngetting somewhere he really shouldn&#39;t be, I figure there&#39;s no harm in<br/>\na wiggly boy.<br/>\nHe actually does not stay by my side when I&#39;m checking out, but I&#39;ve<br/>\ntried to give him as much freedom as age allows for safely and he&#39;s<br/>\nquite willing to stay nearby.
