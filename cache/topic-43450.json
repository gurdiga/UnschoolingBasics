I agree it will be a process, not a one time thing.  I think I tend to cling to past mistakes and the guilt, instead of letting it go and moving forward.  Something I guess I just need to keep working on.  As Anne of Green Gables says, &quot;Tomorrow is a brand new day with no mistakes in it!&quot;  Reading the e-mails on the list is definitely a beginning in the healing process.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by:      &quot;rebecca de&quot;            <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebeccadehate@...\">rebeccadehate@...</a>                                       rebeccadehate                   <br/>\n    <br/>\n      Sat Mar 20, 2010 11:50 am        (PDT)    <br/>\n                      <br/>\n<br/>\n      Amy , I&#39;m still dealing with quilt... I begin to wash that feeling away  but than I slip into &#39;old&#39; parenting style and than the quilt process starts all over...  I think that we just have to keep learning to forgive ourselves and soon we can let it go.  yesterday I was talking to my oldest whose now 7 and I asked him if he remembers when I use to spank or time out too much -- he said no ... so sometimes I think we worry too much about that!!  granted I want to continue towards a even more peaceful home front but I  think that any damage I may have done in past I am healing...  One of the biggest things I know that my children respond to well -- is when I openly apologize .<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca De Hate<br/>\nwww.the-team.<br/>\nbiz/mv978831<br/>\nwww.rebeccadehate.vpweb.com<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43445,"nextTopicId":43416}}
