And depending on his age and personality, just being with him, doing what he wants to do.  i.e. if he wants to sit and watch cartoons, sitting with him instead of going off to the other room and sitting on the computer, for example.  Tuning in instead of tuning out, but on his terms. I find it hard at times, especially for repetitive viewing of kid television. But it makes a difference to my kids,and it&#39;s a two way street it seems.  When we tune in to them, they tune in to us more, resulting in things running more smoothly and everyone having more fun or at least a better day.   <br/>\nI have to remind myself of this often, because it&#39;s easy for me to tune out.  My husband, who is home with them during the day (I work FT outside the home), has an easier time with it for some reason.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!  Are you reading unschooling blogs?  I find them helpful, reassuring, and inspiring. :)<br/>\n-Renee \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":451233049,"authorName":"tawha","from":"tawha &lt;tawha@...&gt;","profile":"tawhabarboza","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hello and pleased to meet you all","postDate":"1287857499","msgId":44996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlFQzA0RUNGMTZGOTRGOUE4QjIzMTIwQUFBMjhFODIzQDMzNzA3OGVjZTliMzRiNz4="},"prevInTopic":44994,"nextInTopic":44998,"prevInTime":44995,"nextInTime":44997,"topicId":44990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Kimberly to the journey of Unschooling.
