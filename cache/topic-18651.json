If you deny her things she feels are important you&#39;ll be <br/>\nmaking the hole bigger.  It&#39;s not about the stuff.  The stuff isn&#39;t the <br/>\nissue.  The issue is her need, but in denying the stuff you make the need <br/>\ngreater.   When she feels emotionally fulfilled, and when she&#39;s had more <br/>\nexperience with getting what she needs, emotionally and materialistically, <br/>\nshe&#39;ll be able to see the difference.  She won&#39;t feel the &quot;need&quot; for <br/>\n*things* like she does now.  But that takes time and can only be done on <br/>\n*her* schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why your personal attention and involvement is the other side of the <br/>\ncoin.  Your involvement is more important than the stuff. Personal attention <br/>\nfrom you is what she&#39;s really in need of.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I do.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might not be enough.   Sometimes it can feel like we&#39;re giving an giving <br/>\nand it should be enough, but when another person has a need only they can <br/>\ndetermine what the right amount of personal time and attention is enough. <br/>\nYour daughter might need more than your giving.  She won&#39;t get filled up, <br/>\nemotionally, if her needs aren&#39;t being met.  Spend more time with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Those are pretty big assumtions.  ***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Trouble making decisions&quot; is an assumption too.    &quot;Trouble because of an <br/>\nanxiety disorder&quot; is an assumption.  Lots and lots of people are not easy <br/>\nmaking decisions.  But with kids especially, the more opportunity they have <br/>\nto make decisions that receive the support of a parent the more comfortable <br/>\nthey get and the more they come to trust their own judgment.  There are <br/>\nadults who struggle making decisions.  It&#39;s not fair to expect a little <br/>\ngirl, who has much less experience making decisions,  to have mastered it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***My dh & I talked about giving her $7 a week for an allowance.  The<br/>\ncostume cost $30.  You do the math.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven dollars a week won&#39;t help her get a costume she wants by Halloween. <br/>\nHow much do you spend a week on the things you want?<br/>\nThirty dollars is a pretty expensive costume but I bet she could have <br/>\nenjoyed it a hundred times that amount if she&#39;d received it joyfully and if <br/>\nyou&#39;d been enthusiastic for and with her.   You could have made the <br/>\nallowance retroactive, back five weeks, then she could have gotten the <br/>\ncostume.  She could have taken a draw on the next five weeks.  She could <br/>\nhave paid you back from her allowance over a few months.

Given our <br/>\ncurrent (and not changing anytime soon) income i could not have bought it, <br/>\nhowever, when i tell our kids we cant get something when we are shopping or <br/>\natleast not that day, i am not planning on buying ALOT of other stuff and <br/>\ngoing out to lunch.  Saying sorry we cant afford that today cause we have to <br/>\nbuy ALL this other stuff and go to lunch anywhere you want sounds like an <br/>\nexcuse (even if somewhat true) to a kid.  Typically when we go out I let the <br/>\nkids know exactly what we are going for.  If they really like something we <br/>\ntalk about coming back next month or the next day or perhaps giving up <br/>\neating out or some other compremise.  My kids are still young enough that a <br/>\ntrip to the dollar store helps fill the need something but i know that <br/>\ndoesnt work as they get older.  That being said NOONE in our family gets to <br/>\njust go to the store and buy something very often cause we trully cant <br/>\nafford it.

They have rarely seen us <br/>\njust go in a store and buy something cause it looks interesting or fun cause <br/>\nwe trully cant afford it.  That being said I think it is easier in someways <br/>\nto accept, &quot;not today&quot; from us.<br/>\nSometimes just telling the child that yes, i understand you really want this <br/>\nand yes it looks cool and then figuring out together away you could make it <br/>\nor buy it the day after halloween or something helps.
