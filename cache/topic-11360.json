I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve the chaos amongst the kids and teachers and chaperones. They <br/>\nwere so rushed....had pencils and dittos in hand and were being yelled <br/>\nout from all around to hurry and did they write on their dittos. I was <br/>\nstruck by a young boy about 9 or so that looked so frustrated....he <br/>\nturned to his teacher who was yelling(not talking but yelling) at him <br/>\nto fill out his ditto...and he said no I don&#39;t want to I want to look <br/>\nat the fish...and he meant it lol the teacher said well then you will <br/>\nbe in trouble when we get back and he said I don&#39;t care. (perfect <br/>\nunschooling candidate I thought to myself lol)Some people probably <br/>\nthought him to be fresh but I thought to myself this boy just wants to <br/>\nenjoy his time but wasn&#39;t being allowed to.<br/>\nIn the meantime my son and I walked slowly enjoying everything, taking <br/>\nour time staying long past the school children.....talking and <br/>\nlaughing. He said to me Mom I am so happy not to be in school anymore <br/>\nand I said Oh me too!!!<br/>\n<br/>\npeace<br/>\nKaren in NY</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11332,"nextTopicId":11358}}
