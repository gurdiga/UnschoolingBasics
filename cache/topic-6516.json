She compares herself to<br/>\nother children approximately her age.  She has three cousins that are  <br/>\nthe<br/>\nsame age, two of them live in our same town. They go to school.  She has<br/>\nseveral homeschooled friends but they are not unschooled and are a bit<br/>\nolder than her.  All of these children have more advanced knowledge in<br/>\nthe typical schoolish subjects like reading and mathematics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey like to talk about schoolish subjects or compare themselves and<br/>\nZoe is feeling inferior on several counts.  It isn&#39;t limited to  <br/>\nlevels of knowledge<br/>\nthough.  She also compares her body shape to other kids and says that  <br/>\nshe<br/>\nwishes her eyes were bigger and rounder like a friends, or her legs were<br/>\nskinnier like another.<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI really think this is more about the age than about the school or lack-of-school. But if she&#39;s hanging around schooled kids, some of those &quot;certain&quot; comparisons will rub off. I think that age is generally all *about* making comparisons. If she *weren&#39;t* making them, I might be a little worried! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think that up until 6-7, we make very few &quot;big&quot; comparisons---I mean, we can tell the red from the blue and which is the larger cookie! &lt;G&gt; But more subtle comparisons start at 7-8. And then we can really start fine-tuning them<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the schoolish/societal comparisons can be pretty creepy---even leading youngish children to wanting nose jobs and strict diets and straight As. It&#39;s a very bad time to grade children in schools, because the idea of being stupid---or smarter than everyone else---starts in earnest.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as the &quot;knowledge comparisons&quot; go, I&#39;ve noticed that his age of unschooled child seems very &quot;behind&quot; schooled peers. The schooled kids are learning...well, schoolish things---and they come across as VERY important (because the children are TOLD that!). You daughter may seem behinder and behinder for a few years. But then, those schooled kids are going to put on the learning brakes---and HARD! She will be making her massive connections, but in a more random, subtle way. At 15 or so, she will *suddenly* seem light years ahead of them! But it may take until then for her to realize THAT comparison! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nShe has many skills and talents that her friends and cousins don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave.  She<br/>\nis a wonderful artist and can draw remarkably well.  She is the only<br/>\none of her friends and cousins who twirls baton and is very good at  <br/>\nit for a beginner.<br/>\nShe plays soccer and has started making goals this season. Her friends<br/>\nappreciate her vivid imagination and she is sought out for imaginary  <br/>\nplay.<br/>\nShe has a quick giggle and infectious laugh.  She&#39;s quite beautiful  <br/>\nin my eyes and<br/>\nto many others.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\nAnd these things may become more and more HUGE and extreme, as she will have all that extra time to devote to them. Her friends will not have that kind of time! Her own beauty will be even *more* obvious, because she will 1) get more rest and better food! &lt;g&gt; and 2) she will be happy with herself and in what she has accomplished and in what she knows she is capable of. But that will take time.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she says negative things about herself or compares herself  <br/>\nnegatively<br/>\nwith her friends and cousins I try to acknowledge that she&#39;s noticing  <br/>\nthese things.<br/>\nI downplay her physical comparisons and I try to point out her good  <br/>\nqualities,<br/>\nskills and talents and explain that everyone achieves different  <br/>\nskills at their own rate.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s good advice---but I think that pointing out *other* comparisons---like the differences between fine, antique furniture vs K-Mart furniture---can be helpful. That someone took the time and love and knowledge to make this glorious chest of drawers---look at the fine workmanship. You can&#39;t always *see* that from the outside---from far away. But when you get closer and pull out the drawers and see dove-tailing and other handwork---sometimes even signatures!, THAT&#39;s when you see the real beauty, the real quality. And *that* didn&#39;t happen overnight! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nCameron did a lot of that while in school (but he was a really good artist and friend, so he was greatly admired for those things!). But when he left, many of his friends told him how stupid he would be if he didn&#39;t go to school or get one of those *magic* diplomas. Not much I said made any difference. Time did.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe LOVES being who he is now He&#39;s SOOO comfortable in his own skin! That&#39;s priceless! IT really is---and at 17???!!! I think I was in my early 30&#39;s before I was so comfortabe with myself! But he went through a tough time there at first. <br/>\n <br/>\nLet her make comparisons---but be serious about it. Help her understand what is *really* important---and how long that sometimes takes! &lt;G&gt; OOHOOHOOH! Read The Velveteen Rabbit!!! Talk about what it&#39;s like to be REAL! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think *your* attitude is important. She&#39;ll trust you not to steer her wrong. Moms who are diet freaks, with nose jobs and perfect houses and the latest cars and whose kids *must* get into Ivy League schools---well, they are contributing to *false* comparisons! Help her find what&#39;s real---and be patient!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170260284,"authorName":"Sandrewmama","from":"Sandrewmama &lt;sandrewmama@...&gt;","profile":"sandrewmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"self-comparisons","postDate":"1126153160","msgId":6516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4RkQ3OEY5LUM5MkQtNDA2Qy05ODA5LUU2MTMzQzg0MkJFMkBtY2hzaS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6523,"prevInTime":6515,"nextInTime":6517,"topicId":6516,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a challenge I m facing with my #2 child, Zoe (7) that I didn t run into with my #1 child, Zach (14).
