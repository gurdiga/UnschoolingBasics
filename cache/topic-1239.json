My dd is<br/>\n2yrs9mos, <br/>\nand ds is 8yrs8mos. I am having some trouble feeling like my time is<br/>\nbalanced <br/>\nwith them . Right now, it seems as though everything is very much run around<br/>\n<br/>\ndd, and her needs, and that I am not doing such a great job of meeting my <br/>\nson&#39;s needs. It is hard to go places with dd as she is very easily<br/>\noverstimulated <br/>\nand gets kind of uncomfortable in a wild way. She is great if we stay home<br/>\nand <br/>\nshe can be naked and do what she wants to do. we are still nursing, and she <br/>\nhas no real sleep pattern, with one day napping, one day not. Up till<br/>\nmidnight <br/>\nsometimes, sleeping by 7pm sometimes. I really want her to do what is right <br/>\nfor her body, at the same time sometimes we will go for a few days where I<br/>\ncan&#39;t <br/>\neven read to ds. I have taken to turning the tv on for her so he and I can <br/>\nplay a game or read. <br/>\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or ideas? The worry is large that poor ds<br/>\nis <br/>\nnot getting what he needs to enjoy himself right now.<br/>\nThanks very much,<br/>\nNancy in BC, sad cause we are just too far from any conferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

We didn&#39;t have the<br/>\n&quot;going out&quot; problem so much since my daughter prefers to be at home.  But my<br/>\ndaughter started commenting on the fact that &quot;You spend all your time<br/>\nplaying with Nicky!&quot;  She even asked me to limit the time I was playing with<br/>\nhim!  What ended up helping was a couple of things.  Firstly, we talked<br/>\nabout it quite a bit and I acknowledged that Nicky was going through a big<br/>\nphase of wanting to play with mama all the time and this was a big switch<br/>\nfrom when he wanted to just play with his big sister all the time.  I told<br/>\nher I could see how difficult this was for her and I encouraged her to tell<br/>\nme at the point at which she wanted to have time with me (as opposed to<br/>\nwaiting for me to be &quot;free&quot; which is what she was doing endlessly).  I also<br/>\nstarted just randomly checking in with her throughout the day, asking &quot;How<br/>\nare you doing?  Is there anything you want to do with mama?&quot;  If she said<br/>\n&quot;yes&quot;, I started asking my son to wait.  I&#39;d explain that Leenie needed me<br/>\nto do such and such with her right now and suggest something he could do or<br/>\ninvite him to join us in some way.  Sometimes he&#39;d trot off and do something<br/>\nelse, sometimes he&#39;d join us, sometimes he would just choose to nurse during<br/>\nthese periods and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s still nursing since that helped him wait.<br/>\nWish I could offer you help on the going out part of it, but we have the<br/>\nopposite situation here - 3 year old wants to go out more often and older<br/>\nchild is the confirmed introvert homebody.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77817828,"authorName":"LOWRIEK@aol.com","from":"LOWRIEK@...","profile":"nancylowrie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Balancing the Age Split","postDate":"1088471139","msgId":1239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzLjJkZThkNzFlLjJlMTIxYTYzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1241,"prevInTime":1238,"nextInTime":1240,"topicId":1239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I am writing for some help or advice or something!
