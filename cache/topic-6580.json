When she said &quot;spoon&quot;, I used my best judgement to decide teaspoon or tablespoon, and when she said she wanted to use a cup of cinnamon, I pointed out that a little bit of cinnamon goes a long ways, otherwise she came up with this all on her own.  She said I can share it with you.  She calls it cake, but it is really a quick bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoira&#39;s Experiment Bread &quot;Cake&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n1 egg<br/>\n1 c. milk<br/>\n1 T. sugar (she used brown)<br/>\n2 c. flour<br/>\n3/4 t. salt<br/>\n1 T. butter<br/>\n2 t. baking powder<br/>\n1 T. honey<br/>\n1 T. cinnamon<br/>\n<br/>\nMix all the ingredients together, then bake in a small loaf pan at 350Â° for 35-40 minutes.  I have small loaf pans that are 3&quot;x5.5&quot;x2&quot; that we used.  The first time we made it, that was the perfect size.  When we made it tonight, it overflowed a bit onto the bottom of the oven.  But it yummy slathered with butter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6495,"nextTopicId":6590}}
