I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\n&gt; her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\n&gt; still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>\n&gt; go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\n&gt; her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>\n&gt; get angry.

There have been many times I&#39;ve let <br/>\nElla&#39;s meltdowns trigger meltdowns in me too! I consider myself &quot;highly sensitive&quot; and the <br/>\nscreaming REALLY pushes my buttons and has often led to me being the one screaming! I <br/>\nam learning, however, to say and mean &quot;Yes&quot; to <br/>\nher more (which has helped tremendously with the meltdowns caused by frustration) and <br/>\nthen to just accept her anger and not get <br/>\nangry myself. I also love what you said about not expecting &quot;respect&quot; from our kids. <br/>\nRespect is modeled from us - she&#39;ll get it someday. And quite frankly I believe she is <br/>\ntrying out certain &quot;disrespectful&quot; behaviors she is picking up from TV&#39;s protrayal of kids <br/>\nand other kids she knows. I need to just let her know that those ways of speaking can <br/>\nsometimes hurt feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Jessie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3189,"nextTopicId":3198}}
