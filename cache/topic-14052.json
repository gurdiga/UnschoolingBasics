He was so naive<br/>\nand inexperienced it&#39;s almost unbelievable he survived but it&#39;s a good<br/>\nstory.   Maybe you could take your son to the Selway on vacation.  You<br/>\ncan rent the McGruder ranger station which is one of the places from the<br/>\nbook.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how he could go alone yet, legally but one thought is if you<br/>\nrented a forest service cabin and stopped in to see him once a day.   It<br/>\nmight be against the forest service rental policy so you&#39;d have to deal<br/>\nwith your moral compass on that one.   Most of the cabins only rent for a<br/>\nweek at a time but maybe you could convince a couple of friends to rent<br/>\nit for consecutive weeks . ( their name on the books, you paying for it) <br/>\n Forest service cabins have available wood and usually some cooking<br/>\nutensils etc.    I don&#39;t know where you are and maybe you&#39;re in the wrong<br/>\npart of the country for forest service cabin rentals.  Google<br/>\n&quot;recreational cabin and lookout rentals.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other thought, which would be organized : ( would be field work with a<br/>\nuniversity student.   Check with your local university or look online.   <br/>\nThat can be remote and lonely, depends on the work. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan one parent rent a cabin for the summer and relocate with him?   Maybe<br/>\nit could be within commuting distance to work for mom or dad and he could<br/>\nbe alone during the days.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you go on a long wilderness hiking/camping vacation with him?    If<br/>\nonly one parent goes it might feel more like a friendship camaraderie<br/>\nthing than a parents vacationing with kid thing.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] wilderness activity advice needed","postDate":"1149436814","msgId":14063,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmIwMWM2ODdlZiRmNzg5ZTIyMCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PDA2MDQyMDA2MTM0NS4xNjA1LjQ0ODJFM0ZDMDAwQjQ0MzUwMDAwMDY0NTIyMDA3MzQ4MzBDRUM3Q0FDODA4MEU5RDBFOUNAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":14058,"nextInTopic":14064,"prevInTime":14062,"nextInTime":14064,"topicId":14052,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have him watch the great show called Survivorman .

Legally he&#39;s too young to be <br/>\n&quot;out in the wilderness alone&quot;---you could be cited for some <br/>\nneglect/endangerment issues if something happened or if he were <br/>\n&#39;caught&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not Back To School Camps---either in Vermont or in Oregon might be a <br/>\npossibility. He could meet a bunch of other unschoolers with some of <br/>\nthe same ideas. Maybe they could brainstorm. Cameron&#39;s been in Kentucky <br/>\nthis week at a &quot;Gathering&quot; of unschooling NBTSCampers---not an official <br/>\ngathering---just a bunch who wanted to get together before camp starts <br/>\nthis fall. They&#39;re all living in a cabin owned by own of the campers. <br/>\nThey&#39;re being fairly self-sufficient, I guess. No phone access, so I <br/>\ncan&#39;t be sure. He&#39;ll be home late tonight, so I&#39;ll get the full scoop <br/>\nthen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wilderness Ventures, our of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, would be a good <br/>\nstart too. No &quot;adult-adults&quot;, but some young adults---21-25. Camping <br/>\nunder the stars, backpacking, rafting, mountain climbing---many <br/>\ndifferent options to chose among. It&#39;s pretty organized though!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cameron has this wish too. We haven&#39;t yet figured out how to manage it <br/>\nin reality. He&#39;s 18 now though, so there&#39;s not the neglect issue to <br/>\nworry about any more. Our trip to the Grand Canyon in September may <br/>\nspur him to try that route though.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is probably not an uncommon desire for young men.
