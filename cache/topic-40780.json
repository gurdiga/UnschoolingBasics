I left hs in grade 9, with occasional forays into some alternate ed programs thereafter, never completed anything beyond grade 8 maths or sciences because I didn&#39;t enjoy them. When I finally decided to go to school at 27, I did a placement test, scored in the top percentiles for everything except algebraic math and went on the graduate from university on the deans list while single parenting my young son. I could have upgraded maths and done something else, but chose to do a program that was up my alley that didn&#39;t have any math requirements. I do think I might have struggled if I had tried to go the math route, not because I hadn&#39;t learned it before but because I still don&#39;t enjoy all the rote learning involved. I find it tedious and can&#39;t get excited about it like I can with other schooly things like writing papers, which I loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point is that from my experience and from older unschoolers I know personally and from online, I am absolutely not worried about academics for children and it is not usually one of the criticisms that gets my hackles up ( I have others ). It sounds like it is still a worry for you though, so probably having some more success stories you can call up in your mind when other&#39;s doubts start to get to you could help. I find my need to defend is generally related to my own fear and doubt, so soothing that for myself keeps me calm, relaxed and confident and that just comes through in my responses. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am dealing with my son&#39;s dad (ex-partner) and his family including a sister who is a teacher, who are really not happy that I decided to take him out of school, have been threatening court, etc. I almost wrote back a big defensive email to the recent concerns and then read Scott Noelle&#39;s post that has been reprinted here and remembered how confident I am that this is the right choice for us. So instead of sounding cornered and defensive in my response, I believe (hope) I sounded calm, confident and assured as well as understanding of his concern. When other people do question, I give them a little quip about Terran wanting to read for more than 15 minutes a day and not really wanting to glue cotton balls on construction paper and leave it at that unless they suddenly become very interested and start asking meaningful questions, which happens more often than I would have imagined.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220041937,"authorName":"Heather","from":"Heather &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt;","profile":"heathermccarty1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: How to respond to sister/teacher","postDate":"1248175845","msgId":40802,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBNjVBNkU1LjUwMjAyMDVAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5NzYwOTU4NjgwODQ5RjI4QjFEMDc4Q0E0RDdFRkI4QFNQQU0+","referencesHeader":"PEM5NzYwOTU4NjgwODQ5RjI4QjFEMDc4Q0E0RDdFRkI4QFNQQU0+"},"prevInTopic":40801,"nextInTopic":40803,"prevInTime":40801,"nextInTime":40803,"topicId":40780,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... required to ...

There were many girls there that had attended private and public schools that had placed in remedial courses in order to be ready to take on the standard curriculum for their intended majors.   My daughter will be taking an intermediate algebra before taking college algebra but she has a math LD so that makes sense in the scheme of things... the school she attended as a young child tested her for a math LD ... found the math LD but said her IQ was so high that they were just going to wait for her to fail before helping her because she was doing fine in their eyes (getting more frustrated each year, spending hours on math homework, in tears each afternoon because she didn&#39;t understand it etc).   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway long story short... my child does not need a period of &quot;catching up&quot; to attend college nor do most homeschooled children(whether unschooled or more traditionally homeschooled).   The college that my daughter will be attending was very complimentary about homeschooling and worked with us to get all traditional documentation they needed translated from our homeschooling records.   I wrote up course descriptions and included most of our nontraditional methods and outside activities in these descriptions which they were very impressed by.   I think there are lists somewhere out there of colleges that are considered to be &quot;homeschooler friendly&quot;  ... I would venture to say that most colleges fit that description as we applied to 4 state schools that also were very homeschooler friendly and 2 private colleges that were very homeschooler friendly.   Perhaps your sister just needs to know that colleges understand and accept that homeschoolers may arrive with nontraditional transcripts but are every bit as prepared (and more in most cases) to attend college and succeed! <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How to respond to sister/teacher","postDate":"1248035222","msgId":40796,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgzdnZpbStkcGJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgzc3JmcCs5bzZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40795,"nextInTopic":40797,"prevInTime":40795,"nextInTime":40797,"topicId":40780,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************** Something I did with my dad was to say I ve been doing a lot of research on this, would you like me to email you some links?

I would just say &quot;for now&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;for the time being&quot; when someone well-meaning would ask about or try <br/>\nto judge our unschooling. It worked from kindergarten age right through <br/>\nto Favorite Daughter&#39;s present as university scholarship junior at age <br/>\n19, backpacking around Europe.  Every year I&#39;d be asked, &quot;So do you <br/>\nthink she&#39;ll go to school next year then?&quot; And I&#39;d say &quot;we&#39;ll see&quot; or <br/>\nquote the recurring line from Shakespeare in Love when asked how things <br/>\nwould work out: &quot;I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a mystery!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it really was a mystery. I had confidence we&#39;d be fine whatever came <br/>\nalong, but couldn&#39;t predict how, and have often been surprised.  So <br/>\nthink about it: if YOU can&#39;t predict it, how can relatives or neighbors <br/>\nor teachers or anyone, however well-meaning? When your unschooling kids <br/>\nare little, learning not to fear nor force the future might be the most <br/>\nimportant kind of learning, for both parent and child. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that our unschooling mystery will predict how yours will turn out <br/>\nbut I was quite right to believe it would turn out well: with no <br/>\nschooling, not even any parental planning or pushing, no formal study in <br/>\nany high school &quot;subjects&quot; (plus a latent disorder/disability in math <br/>\ncoding, as it turned out) she HAS learned everything she needs and <br/>\nwants, to be where she wants to be, doing what she wants to do and <br/>\ncharting her own wide-open future.

And then when the babies were born? Everyone knew just how to raise them. And what to do when they fussed or what you should feed them or how they should be dressed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is that sort of advice, imo. Offered whether you asked or not. Well-meaning but completely disconnected from your actual child. And, after a while, you learn to filter -- nodding and smiling and then proceeding to do what you know is best for you and yours. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to top that off, your sister is a ps teacher. What has she spent the past years learning about? How valuable what she does for a living, and no doubt works hard at and is underpaid for, is for all children. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to see how she thinks every child should have the benefit of the system she believes in. Heck, my husband installs tile and marble -- I think everyone should have tile floors. :) Now, translate that to something really important, her love of your children as their aunt, and imagine how strange and insulting it is to her to reject everything she believes in. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to say though? Read online about the many success stories of kids who have gone on to have brilliant college or business careers. Yes, that&#39;s part of the story. But not the point. The point is the happiness and well-being of your actual children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son went to ps briefly. He lasted for 7 months of Kindergarten. The problem? He could already read and he was trying to be good but he was really, really bored. And they never taught him anything new. That was his big complaint when I finally asked why he seemed so sad. A sad 6-year-old? My 6-year-old? Sad? Break my heart! Well, he was out of there pretty swiftly but not as a rejection of the ps system for everyone. Just that it didn&#39;t fit him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis grew into DD staying home and now we have been home for over 10 years. But DD has decided she wants to return to ps for high school. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we are doing what fits our particular children. Using the ps system when it works and rejecting it when it doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t have to be a big battle about the system with your sister. And it doesn&#39;t have to be about some hypothetical teen. This is about your actual child. And his needs now and as they change. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like the other decisions you have made for your babies, you don&#39;t need your sister&#39;s permission or agreement. And if it turns out that she can&#39;t see that the best path for your son is to homeschool, there are other things to discuss. You could ask her how things are going in school now that her funding has been cut (the typical school story around here).<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, during an IM chat with my sister, who is a 3rd grade public school teacher, I mentioned to her that Tristan would not be returning to school this next year.

And that I felt sorry that teachers had to use what the district provided. That went over well with the other grandmother who had been a math teacher and liked the idea that I thought teachers should be able to choose the books they wanted to work from. (On one of the ed blogs I read, a math teacher was crying because they took away Saxon and were substituting books he does not believe in. If his students don&#39;t do well, he will be blamed as a poor teacher. Take away his tools, give him shoddy substitutes, and blame him for the poor outcome!) <br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case, if your teaching sister brings up preparation for college again, you might start talking about how many students start college poorly prepared, how all colleges, even the most elite, have remedial classes, and what a burden it is for people to pay college tuition for what was already bought and and paid for on the high school level. <br/>\n<br/>\nHTH, <br/>\nHomeschooling Granny <br/>\nNursing is the biological norm for mothers and babies.

Sometimes it is easier to just not bring it up. Talk about other things and don&#39;t initiate conversations about your unschooling or parenting choices. If she brings it up keep it relatively neutral and calm and do what you can to not feel like you are on the defensive about your family&#39;s choices. And change the subject. Move on to talking about other things. You don&#39;t have to do it abruptly, answer whatever question was asked and then ask something back that is on a new topic. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to know that you won&#39;t have the support of friends and family when you feel the need for support. They won&#39;t be the people to turn to when things get hard or frustrating. They&#39;ll be more likely to say I told you so than to say well, if you look at it this way, or maybe you are just having a hard time seeing all these amazing things. And with that in mind you have to move away from leaning on them for engaging and supportive conversations about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":369294489,"authorName":"Annora Guidry","from":"Annora Guidry &lt;ms_apg@...&gt;","profile":"ms_apg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How to respond to sister/teacher","postDate":"1247967929","msgId":40784,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0NzU1LjQwNjYucW1Ad2ViMzExMDEubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgzc3JmcCs5bzZmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40780,"nextInTopic":40787,"prevInTime":40783,"nextInTime":40785,"topicId":40780,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I too am glad that I came to my senses before my two younger children will be subjected to school.  I have been bracing myself for the unwanted questions and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1878299147\">I too am glad that I came to my senses before my two younger children will be subjected to school.  I have been bracing myself for the unwanted questions and advice as we embark on this journey and have come to the conclusion that I will compile a list of media that can do the talking for me and refuse to have the conversation.  I will gladly discuss my theories with perfect strangers, in fact my best friend and I are planning on starting a public blog, but I&#39;d rather not experience the range of emotions that will emerge if my mother-in-law or anyone else in my family forces me to feel that I have to defend my parenting style.  Good Luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sat, 7/18/09, Brent & Rae &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rachaelreese@...\">rachaelreese@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Brent & Rae &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rachaelreese@...\">rachaelreese@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] How to respond to sister/teacher<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Saturday, July 18, 2009, 10:58 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  I want to preface this by explaining that I have four children, ages 11, 9, 3 and 8 months.
