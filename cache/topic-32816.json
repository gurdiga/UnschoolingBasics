I don&#39;t know what I would<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; done. My friend Elly was at a gathering of unschoolers some time ago.<br/>\n&gt; She<br/>\n&gt; was invited to spend the weekend with a family she and I were<br/>\n&gt; both acquainted with. There were three other families there whom she<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know before that weekend. Those families professed to be radical<br/>\n&gt; unschoolers. Our acquantance is about as radical as they come.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Something happened that weekend that really disturbed my friend. In the<br/>\n&gt; early evening on Saturday the 15yo daughter of our acquaintance asked<br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; dad for a joint. He went into the bedroom where he kept his stuff, and<br/>\n&gt; brought her out a joint. The 15yo thanked her dad and went to join the<br/>\n&gt; other teens. Elly&#39;s son told her that the 15yo smoked it on the porch<br/>\n&gt; and offered it to the other teens there, who declined. Please keep in<br/>\n&gt; mind<br/>\n&gt; that we know this teen and her mom, but we hardly know the dad.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The way my friend describes it, once she had gathered her wits, she<br/>\n&gt; kinda<br/>\n&gt; lit into the guy. She didn&#39;t so much question his parenting as his<br/>\n&gt; judgment<br/>\n&gt; in putting everyone there at risk. He defended himself by saying that<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather his daughter smoke pot under his watchful eye than away from<br/>\n&gt; home. My friend said, well you&#39;re not at home now (they were in a<br/>\n&gt; rented<br/>\n&gt; beach house) and how dare you put us all at risk of being hauled to<br/>\n&gt; jail.<br/>\n&gt; He said, you&#39;re overreacting -- nobody&#39;s going to jail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Elly was at a loss as to what to do. They left the next morning. I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know what I would have done. I haven&#39;t been able to look at this<br/>\n&gt; family the<br/>\n&gt; same way since then. I&#39;m happy that my son has never socialized with<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; teen daughter. Have any of you encountered a situation like that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nope. But I have plenty of pot experience with a teen. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Basically the dad was right in that &quot;no one&#39;s going to jail.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Meaning---he lucked out that time. And probably had many, many times<br/>\n&gt; before. And probably *will* many, many times in the future. Seems like<br/>\n&gt; a common happening at their home. Taking that attitude, though, *could*<br/>\n&gt; risk having one of the irate parents there sending the cops to his<br/>\n&gt; house! He might regret that decision one day.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Although I *do* think marijuana should be legal (thanks to my son&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; research), I have never smoked pot---and probably never will. I do<br/>\n&gt; recognize that this dad certainly has the *right* to believe as he does<br/>\n&gt; (under his watchful eye and all)---but I have HUGE problems with his<br/>\n&gt; lack of respect for others there who don&#39;t share his beliefs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cameron and I spent many hours talking about his pot smoking. I *knew*<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t stop him (and if any of you think you *can* stop your kids<br/>\n&gt; from doing anything they set their minds to---think again!), but we<br/>\n&gt; needed to have a common understanding of what it means to purposefully<br/>\n&gt; break laws and what kind of situation that could put our family in. It<br/>\n&gt; was a HOT topic for several years. And one I&#39;ve written extensively<br/>\n&gt; about on this and several other lists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *I* would have lit into this guy too, because he wasn&#39;t taking *US*<br/>\n&gt; into consideration.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t have a problem letting my child associate with the daughter.<br/>\n&gt; I *would* ask her how she feels about putting others who don&#39;t share<br/>\n&gt; her beliefs at risk. I would try to understand *her* viewpoint. To me,<br/>\n&gt; her father&#39;s a lost cause, but I would like to know where *she* stands<br/>\n&gt; and whether she&#39;d be willing to listen to what bothers me about the<br/>\n&gt; laissez faire attitude her father displayed that night. My guess is<br/>\n&gt; that she was trying to &quot;impress&quot; her friends. But she could very well<br/>\n&gt; share her dad&#39;s views.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that, when sharing lodging, we need to be cognizant of the<br/>\n&gt; needs/wants/desires of *all* present. Imposing something illegal could<br/>\n&gt; very well make others uncomfortable. And discomfort is not something I<br/>\n&gt; choose to cause my guests. I try to make my home (and rental properties<br/>\n&gt; &lt;g&gt;) comfortable for *all* present. This dad doesn&#39;t share my views on<br/>\n&gt; how to make that happen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can read more about my struggle (or lack of one) with pot in the<br/>\n&gt; archives here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; Conference Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt; http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org&lt;http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Consequences  & pot","postDate":"1210907893","msgId":32887,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTg1MUE5QzZCMDE3QS0xNTY4LTFEQTVAd2VibWFpbC1kZDAzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTEzMjIxOWszNjliMjE5N3M0ZTFiYzhlOWE4MDAxNzU1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTEzMjIxOWszNjliMjE5N3M0ZTFiYzhlOWE4MDAxNzU1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32865,"nextInTopic":32889,"prevInTime":32886,"nextInTime":32888,"topicId":32816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We were out for dinner recently with my in laws.  Jade saw others at the table sprinkle salt on their food, so she decided to copy them, and when she turned the shaker upside down tons of salt poured onto her noodles.  I reached to take them when she told me what happened, and my fil said &#39;leave it, maybe she&#39;ll learn a lesson&#39;.  Even before living how we are living it would not have occurred to me to let her eat a mouthful of salt knowing how horrible it would be.  It just seems so meaningless and cruel to me to see something coming that will upset them and just do nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~But kids are naturally more oblivious to their environment. They&#39;re <br/>\nthinking in the moment because that&#39;s how their brains work right <br/>\nnow. Consequences won&#39;t mature their brains. Only time will.

I so love to understand better the timeline of their maturing brains.  In the salt situation what irks me so much is that my fil wouldn&#39;t think of &#39;letting&#39; one of his friends inadvertantly take a mouthful of salt, but when it&#39;s his granddaughter, in his mind it&#39;s a perfectly acceptable way to &#39;teach her a lesson&#39;, argh!  It does help me understand and have more compassion for my husband knowing he was raised by this man.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Consequences (was potty training)","postDate":"1210844726","msgId":32841,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxRTUxNDFCLTEyRjgtNDc1Qi05MTdDLTI2RTZGMTU1MTYzNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTEzMjIxOWszNjliMjE5N3M0ZTFiYzhlOWE4MDAxNzU1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU5MWM1ZGUxMDgwNTEzMjIxOWszNjliMjE5N3M0ZTFiYzhlOWE4MDAxNzU1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32822,"nextInTopic":32865,"prevInTime":32840,"nextInTime":32842,"topicId":32816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *In terms of mindful parenting*, all the ones you listed I would see as natural consequences.

Those families professed to be radical<br/>\nunschoolers.  Our acquantance is about as radical as they come.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething happened that weekend that really disturbed my friend.  In the<br/>\nearly evening on Saturday the 15yo daughter of our acquaintance asked her<br/>\ndad for a joint.  He went into the bedroom where he kept his stuff, and<br/>\nbrought her out a joint.  The 15yo thanked her dad and went to join the<br/>\nother teens.  Elly&#39;s son told her that the 15yo smoked it on the porch<br/>\nand offered it to the other teens there, who declined.  Please keep in mind<br/>\nthat we know this teen and her mom, but we hardly know the dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way my friend describes it, once she had gathered her wits, she kinda<br/>\nlit into the guy.  She didn&#39;t so much question his parenting as his judgment<br/>\nin putting everyone there at risk.  He defended himself by saying that he&#39;d<br/>\nrather his daughter smoke pot under his watchful eye than away from<br/>\nhome.  My friend said, well you&#39;re not at home now (they were in a rented<br/>\nbeach house) and how dare you put us all at risk of being hauled to jail.<br/>\nHe said, you&#39;re overreacting -- nobody&#39;s going to jail.<br/>\n<br/>\nElly was at a loss as to what to do.  They left the next morning.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what I would have done.  I haven&#39;t been able to look at this family the<br/>\nsame way since then.
