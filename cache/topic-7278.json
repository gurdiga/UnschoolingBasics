You will get several <br/>\nstickers regarding different viewpoints on education but I could <br/>\nusually find some good unschooling ones from each site.  I also have a <br/>\nlot that aren&#39;t necessarily unschooling but they express the <br/>\nsentiment, such as: Those of us dancing are thought strange by those <br/>\nwho can&#39;t hear the music, things like that.  I got most of mine from <br/>\nthe following online sites:  cafepress.com, northernsun.com (they will <br/>\nsend you a catalog when you order with some cool stuff in it), and <br/>\npegasuspublishing.com.  I also got some of mine at the conference, Hot <br/>\nTopic, and Bosco (a card-like shop that sells D&D and such).  Maybe I <br/>\nwill post a picture of the back of my van, give me a little bit though <br/>\nbecause I am not real organized, as we are getting ready to move into <br/>\nour motorhome for a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\nChildren aren&#39;t coloring books.
