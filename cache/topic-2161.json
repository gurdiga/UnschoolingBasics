Whatever you think is good, like matching clothes or combed<br/>\nhair,<br/>\n&gt; you can show your child using yourself as an example.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh well, I guess you won&#39;t want to be around Jayn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is too funny :-D. Jayn could model for me of not to be uptight about<br/>\nsuch things. There was a time when someone I know could&#39;ve had animals<br/>\nliving in her hair, and we wouldn&#39;t have known it. I always felt like a<br/>\nneglectful Mom when we were seen in public when her hair was like that. But<br/>\nreally, I think my insisting she sit on the stair every morning so I could<br/>\nfix her hair, led to the snarls when I &quot;let&quot; her own her own head. Same<br/>\nthing with hair washing. Once I let it go, she eventually started to do it<br/>\nherself. Because it was an enjoyable thing for her while playing mermaid or<br/>\nwhatever in the tub--and &#39;cause it felt good. For kids, grooming likely has<br/>\nto be a part of playing and must feel good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes modeling takes a looooooooong time to be effective, but I do<br/>\nagree<br/>\n&gt; that it is the only thing that is, if being happy is the foremost goal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robyn L.
