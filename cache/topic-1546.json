In other<br/>\nwords, I think Kristen needs to get it back, then be asked by the boy<br/>\nwithout the grabbing.  This way the boy hopefully doesn&#39;t grab it the second<br/>\ntime since he got the message to use his words.  Plus your daughter gets the<br/>\nmessage that she should have been asked for it, not have it grabbed away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the boy was not responding to me, I&#39;d likely say something like &quot;Do you<br/>\nthink you can do this on your own, or would it help for me to have your mom<br/>\ncome help?&quot;  If he still didn&#39;t respond, I&#39;d ask the other mother to come<br/>\nhelp...I&#39;d say &quot;excuse me, Sam (or whatever the name is) grabbed this toy<br/>\nfrom Kristen and I&#39;m having a hard time getting him to return it and use his<br/>\nwords.
