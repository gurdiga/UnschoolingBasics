Is that an option <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s calm?We have tried this,he will just follow us and it makes him even angrier. <br/>\nEven the car, for a short drive if necessary.<br/>\nI guess that depends on whether he needs someone there with him to <br/>\nbe safe, whether your house would be safe etc..?He just isn&#39;t ready to be home alone for even a few minutes,he would feel that we have abandoned him.What I can do would be to send my dd with the younger ds out for a drive while I stayed with the older.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess we need more info.<br/>\nHow often is this happening?Not nearly as often as it was even a few days ago.He has just started meds 3 weeks and they are beginning to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd have you checked out Anne Ohman&#39;s list for atypical children?I use to belong to that group,but Anne felt that the moms on that list were just too sensitive to deal with the issues Elijah had.At the time he was very suicidal.I can tell you his background story if anyone is interested.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks so much Ren,<br/>\n  Tricia<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Secondary school education   Graduate school education   Home school education     Graduate school education online   High school education   Chicago school education <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

We hope he can live a peaceful and happy <br/>\nlife without it one day, but this is not that day. He has way to <br/>\nmuch emotional baggage to deal with at this point in his life. Where <br/>\nyour son lashes out, mine directs it inward.  <br/>\nIf you&#39;re saying he has bipolar disorder, then he must have seen a <br/>\ndoctor to get that dx....what does he say? My son&#39;s doctor has been <br/>\nwonderful with us and he bases a lot of his treatment on what I tell <br/>\nhim and he also includes Cimion is his treatment. If your doctor is <br/>\nnot listening to you, I urge you to seek help elsewhere. <br/>\nI also agree with the person who posted about being present more. I <br/>\nam always within feet away when Cimion is interacting with my 7 year <br/>\nold. Also, something that has helped Cimion is, when he is calm and <br/>\nhappy...we talk about how he feels right before he rages and what <br/>\nsignals he can look for. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helps...<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, patricia tidmore <br/>\n&lt;ptidmore1117@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t post very often but we are having a really hard time with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>this one also.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Ren,or anyone, my ds(10)is bipolar and explodes when I or anyone <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tells him no or<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   to stop.And if he doesn&#39;t explode he will just ignore.If we try <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to physically try to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   remove him from hurting his brother(5)(he doesn&#39;t usually hurt <br/>\n </span></blockquote>him,more like alienate <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   him and tease him.really makes him squeel.) he will fight us and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>he is 5&#39;3 and 135 lb<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   and strong beyond belief and has been strong like this from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>birth.I have tried to talk to him after he has had time to calm down <br/>\nand at that time he will be really sad about hitting any of us or <br/>\nhurting our feelings,but when he is in the moment there is no <br/>\nstopping him.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;   Any advice?<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks in advance,<br/>\n&gt;   Tricia </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"siblings and fighting","postDate":"1135369039","msgId":8512,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRvaG0wZit2c2J2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8509,"nextInTopic":8513,"prevInTime":8511,"nextInTime":8513,"topicId":8495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"he will fight us and he is 5 3 and 135 lb and strong beyond belief and has been strong like this from birth.

You say that when you attempt to get your older son to stop in the heat of the moment, he begins fighting you.  So we know that doesn&#39;t work....I would suggest grabbing up your younger child and leaving the room with him to protect him....Then I would want to talk to the doctor about a medication adjustment (if your son is medicated).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also natural things you can try outside of the heat of the moment to help your son be calmer.  Make chamomile tea, for a change of pace, add hibiscus.  Give him a backrub with oils infused with lavender essential oils.  Make sure he gets plenty of exercize.  Make sure he eats a healthy diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.

I&#39;ve got too very sensitive and intense kids.   <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes they <br/>\n&gt; are always &quot;at it&quot; and sometimes things go smoothly.  I&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; learned that we <br/>\n&gt; just go through cycles and sometimes even the best situations  and <br/>\n&gt; the best <br/>\n&gt; parenting still won&#39;t make them happy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just keep going!  You might not get a payoff every day or  <br/>\n&gt; consistently, but <br/>\n&gt; know you are planting seeds.  We had gone through a rough  few <br/>\n&gt; days a few <br/>\n&gt; weeks ago.  Then, my son accidentally popped his sister&#39;s  balloon <br/>\n&gt; that was very <br/>\n&gt; special to her.  He cried and she said &quot;you are more  important to <br/>\n&gt; me than a <br/>\n&gt; balloon, even this one.&quot;  Wow.  I don&#39;t know  many five year olds <br/>\n&gt; that would say <br/>\n&gt; that, but my child.....who the day before  would just as soon <br/>\n&gt; scream at her <br/>\n&gt; brother than look at him.....that day had the  emotional maturity <br/>\n&gt; to comfort <br/>\n&gt; him over her own loss.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also want to recommend the shine with unschooling  yahoo list.   <br/>\n&gt; They talk <br/>\n&gt; a lot about highly sensitive children over there and helping them <br/>\n&gt; feel  <br/>\n&gt; validated.

I&#39;ve got too very sensitive and intense kids.   Sometimes they <br/>\nare always &quot;at it&quot; and sometimes things go smoothly.  I&#39;ve  learned that we <br/>\njust go through cycles and sometimes even the best situations  and the best <br/>\nparenting still won&#39;t make them happy.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust keep going!  You might not get a payoff every day or  consistently, but <br/>\nknow you are planting seeds.  We had gone through a rough  few days a few <br/>\nweeks ago.  Then, my son accidentally popped his sister&#39;s  balloon that was very <br/>\nspecial to her.  He cried and she said &quot;you are more  important to me than a <br/>\nballoon, even this one.&quot;  Wow.  I don&#39;t know  many five year olds that would say <br/>\nthat, but my child.....who the day before  would just as soon scream at her <br/>\nbrother than look at him.....that day had the  emotional maturity to comfort <br/>\nhim over her own loss.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also want to recommend the shine with unschooling  yahoo list.   They talk <br/>\na lot about highly sensitive children over there and helping them feel  <br/>\nvalidated.  I can think of one family in particular that  has siblings that really <br/>\nbutt heads, and I think they have always  unschooled. Have you read the Highly <br/>\nSensitive Child by Elaine Aron?<br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing that often works for us is just getting a change in  scenery.  If <br/>\nyou can do that and everyone is agreeable, I highly recommend  that.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"siblings and fighting","postDate":"1135288208","msgId":8502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRvZjcyZytyMjd1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8501,"nextInTopic":8503,"prevInTime":8501,"nextInTime":8503,"topicId":8495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How long do you think it takes to regain your kids trust after being controlling?

Trevor still acts in ways <br/>\nthat show our former history...just little comments now and then <br/>\nthat make me go &quot;huh?&quot; and then realize it&#39;s just how I set things <br/>\nup when he was younger.  We have trust now, but there are residual <br/>\nthings I see come up.  <br/>\nI think it also depends on how much we slip back into old behavior. <br/>\nThe longer we go with our new tools, the more trust can develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no great wisdom for dealing with two intense kids at <br/>\nonce....I only have one child I would call very &quot;intense&quot;, but any <br/>\nof us can feel intense depending on hunger, hormones or moods.:) <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get one of them actively pursuing something they enjoy, and <br/>\nspend time with whomever is more needy at the moment? Computer works <br/>\nwell here. Or playdough...I can&#39;t say enough good about playdough.<br/>\nA good movie or tv show can be a good distractor too.<br/>\nI always like having a small stash of toys, games or new foods to <br/>\npull out during intense moments.  It&#39;s amazing how the energy can <br/>\nchange with some new things to pawn over.<br/>\nOr a drive. I&#39;m a big fan of just piling into the car and driving <br/>\nwhen more than one child needs you and the energy isn&#39;t good.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo whatever you can to shift the focus. Water play, dig in the <br/>\ndirt....anything to shift into a different place where the focus is <br/>\nno longer about who did what, or how mad someone is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that works, sometimes one of them might need to talk for a <br/>\nlonger time, just venting or bouncing words off someone that can <br/>\nstay centered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey get older every day, they gain new tools, it won&#39;t always be <br/>\nthis hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":115295995,"authorName":"crissyhall","from":"&quot;crissyhall&quot; &lt;crissyhall@...&gt;","profile":"crissyhall","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: siblings and fighting","postDate":"1135276311","msgId":8501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRvZXJlbitscWxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRvZW5rZSsyc2toQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8495,"nextInTopic":8502,"prevInTime":8500,"nextInTime":8502,"topicId":8495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve been working on stop means stop , I need to add the NOW part.

We&#39;ve just started to make progress where<br/>\nshe feels like I&#39;m &quot;on her side&quot; and trying to help everyone including<br/>\nher. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn negotiation, I&#39;ve been trying to help them come up with solutions<br/>\nthat will work for everyone. I can see how too much talking doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork and redirecting is a good idea. But my oldest dd has a very<br/>\nstrong personality and doesn&#39;t want to &quot;give in&quot; and my #2 dd &quot;gives<br/>\nin&quot; just to keep the peace but feels taken advantage of.   One example<br/>\nwas dd#1 wanted to play a game with dd#2 and dd#2 didn&#39;t want to play.<br/>\n I suggested doing something different but dd#1 wanted to play that<br/>\ngame and only that game, and doing something different was the same as<br/>\ngiving in.  So I&#39;ve been trying to show them that there are many<br/>\ndiffent solutions to a problem, and we can come up with something that<br/>\neveryone is happy with, but it takes too long for them to agree on<br/>\nsomething.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question. I&#39;ve heard it said that it takes 1 month of<br/>\ndeschooling for every year of school.  How long do you think it takes<br/>\nto regain your kids trust after being controlling?   I love hearing<br/>\nstories of kids that have a good relationship with their parents even<br/>\nif their parents didn&#39;t find unschooling until much later.  I can see<br/>\nhow so many problems would have been avoided or more easily handled if<br/>\nI had a better history of trust with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!!!
