Its really bothering her.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just read on Wikipedia that some people with dyslexia can read well but not spell well, have difficulty with math computation, difficulty knowing left from right, have balance and coordination issues, short term memory problems and poor personal organizational skills...Uhhh Thats my kid.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  But what are some of the best ways to teach a child like this to learn to spell? Anyone know of any techniques? Programs? Anything?  Thanks for you help.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Holly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are gifts that just keep giving<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.
