Everything was well till last <br/>\n </span></blockquote>February  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - close to her third birthday. Everyday will be lots of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>exploring,  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; experiments, play pretends, food wasnt a problem (from 18 months <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Feb 2006) - I was unschooling. I wanted to see my daughter sleep  <br/>\n&gt; peacefully after the whole day&#39;s experiences and I had a peaceful  <br/>\n&gt; sleep. But there were ups and downs during those periods -  <br/>\n&gt; especially separation anxiety - I had no privacy for using the  <br/>\n&gt; restrooms, taking a warm bath, changing clothes, cooking, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>cleaning  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - I had to carry her to every single place I was; stop always <br/>\n </span></blockquote>meant  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do it again and again - sometimes it took its toll.  Close to her  <br/>\n&gt; third birthday everything changed - lot of emotional upsets - I  <br/>\n&gt; didnt know what was happening - any small issue was  a huge  <br/>\n&gt; meltdown which had made me cry all the way back home after our <br/>\n </span></blockquote>time  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at the park or at the store or from the neighbor&#39;s house. My  <br/>\n&gt; pediatrician is very autocratic - Your daughter is wanting  <br/>\n&gt; attention, even negative attention will do for her; you need to  <br/>\n&gt; change your voice and poise. I started having a lot of arguments  <br/>\n&gt; within myself - whether I am able to provide a safe boundary for  <br/>\n&gt; myself and my daughter - after every event I will feel guilty <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had stopped her from doing something that she really wanted to  <br/>\n&gt; try - the reason I stopped was that when there is going to be a  <br/>\n&gt; time to stop she doesnt stop at all and things turn very ginger. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; used to have lots of discussions (me and my dd) about many things  <br/>\n&gt; that are happening around us - the pollinators. But I feel less <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it happening these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This age was when she wanted more interaction with other kids and  <br/>\n&gt; most of them were at school. But even meeting my friends or going  <br/>\n&gt; to playgrounds did not help because she did not see her friends  <br/>\n&gt; consistently as she wanted to continue her previous game. So it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; upsetting me and I tried to fill the gap by playing as her pal  <br/>\n&gt; always. The problem now is that she is always wanting me next to  <br/>\n&gt; her doing everything that she does - I have made every <br/>\n </span></blockquote>possibility  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of finding help so that I can always be with her but sometimes I  <br/>\n&gt; think the reason she does not do well in a group setting is that  <br/>\n&gt; its us two who always play and I always try to understand and do  <br/>\n&gt; what she says and its not the same outside. So when she goes to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gymnastics class (which she loves) or to swimming (which she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>loves)  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she is panic stricken at the site of the teacher (whom she has to  <br/>\n&gt; follow). There are certain things that I can do - but I dont know  <br/>\n&gt; many things - the teachers are very understanding - but at the  <br/>\n&gt; start of the class it was tears and at the end of the class she  <br/>\n&gt; would be very happy. I feel very sad -seeing this - as I feel I  <br/>\n&gt; dont want you to do something you dont like but since you like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>this  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I want you to enjoy this with this teacher who can tell you many  <br/>\n&gt; things about it and I can learn something too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also giving choices has not worked - it is mostly what she wants <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do - clay doesnt go on wall, you can try something as rough as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wall around the house and I try to search with her testing the  <br/>\n&gt; match. The answer is always no and asking me, &#39;when can I put <br/>\n </span></blockquote>clay  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; on the wall&quot;. All explanations go over her head, can I do it now <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; where she will come back. The same thing with painting - she has  <br/>\n&gt; the freedom to experiment about paints but when it goes to the  <br/>\n&gt; walls where we cannot fix or not on us, it goes into a meltdown.  <br/>\n&gt; Whichever way I go I am finally getting hit with the emotional  <br/>\n&gt; upheaval. I need lots of suggestions on this. Thanks Malini<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20884,"nextTopicId":20888}}
