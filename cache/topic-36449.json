While self-injury may be someone�s way to cope with or relieve painful or hard-to-express feelings and is generally NOT a suicide attempt, relief is always temporary, and usually only perpetuates a destructive cycle that continues the struggle. This cycle often means that those who do not get help can become more depressed and shameful, adding to the pain and need for relief, thus perpetuating the cycle.<br/>\n�<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twloha.com/page.php?id=10\">http://www.twloha.com/page.php?id=10</a><br/>\n�<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.selfinjury.com/\">http://www.selfinjury.com/</a><br/>\n�<br/>\nIntervention Tips<br/>\nThe first thing to do when you suspect, or find out, that your loved one is self injuring is to think through how you are going to respond. <br/>\nIf you are only suspicious, then ask your child/relative if they are physically harming themselves.� If you know they are, tell them that you are there to help.� Share your concerns in a nonjudgmental manner.� Tell them that you know they must be in a lot of emotional pain, and you are sorry that they are &#39;needing&#39; to do this in order to feel better. <br/>\nIf they say, &quot;it&#39;s no big deal,&quot; ask them if the reason they are saying that, is because they fear you&#39;ll get mad?� If they answer no, and continue to minimize the behavior, then tell them that you would like to get a professional evaluation.� Ask them if they have had thoughts of suicide.� If they say yes, then ask if they have a plan.� If they do, then get immediate professional help by taking them to an emergency room or psychiatric hospital for an evaluation. <br/>\nIf they say no, then ask them if they know why they self-injure, and whether or not they are scared?� Tell them you&#39;ll be there to listen to whatever they have to say.� Be prepared to hear things that may be difficult for you to accept.� If you know that you have not always been there for them, consider telling them that you will be there for them now.� If you are sorry, tell them so even if it wasn&#39;t under your control (e.g. illness, divorce, job demands etc.).� Tell them that self-injury is not something they have to, or should, deal with by themselves. What not to do or say:<br/>\n<br/>\nDisplay anger <br/>\nTell them to just stop it <br/>\nInjure yourself; to show them how it makes you feel when they self-injure <br/>\nThink of it as &#39;just a phase&#39;, or &#39;just for attention&#39; <br/>\nPunish or ground them <br/>\n�<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eqi.org/cutting1.htm\">http://www.eqi.org/cutting1.htm</a><br/>\n�<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Cutting-Yourself\">http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Cutting-Yourself</a><br/>\n�<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.essortment.com/articles/self-injury_100006.htm\">http://www.essortment.com/articles/self-injury_100006.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Your Continued Growth & Success!<br/>\n�<br/>\nKytka &quot;Kit&quot; Hilmar-Jezek, ND, PhD<br/>\nSpeaker, Coach, Author, <br/>\n�<br/>\nFounder and Editor of The Age of Attraction Book Series <br/>\nAuthor of Reiki for Children<br/>\nEditor of My Journey To Becoming a Mayan Shaman<br/>\nFounder of the�Following Websites:� The Age of Attraction,<br/>\nWaldorf Homeschoolers, Reiki Kids, Spiritual & Abundant Kids Blog<br/>\nCreator of the Following Videos:� <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/WaldorfHomeschoolers\">http://www.youtube.com/user/WaldorfHomeschoolers</a> <br/>\n�<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36386,"nextTopicId":36485}}
