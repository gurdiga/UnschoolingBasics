Our most popular (at the moment) PS2 game has gotten slightly<br/>\nscratched.  Not huge gashes or anything, just dropped on the floor one<br/>\ntime too many by someone with less than perfect fine motor skills<br/>\n(which could be anyone, but in this case it seems to be poor Keon).<br/>\nThe game keeps sticking at different times.  We&#39;ve cleaned it, but it<br/>\nstill happens.  Different places each time.  We are pretty sure that<br/>\nit is the disk (although if it were the game it would be better<br/>\nbecause we actually have a two year &quot;fix it&quot; insurance on it).  Does<br/>\nanyone know of a (fairly reasonably priced) buffer that you can use on<br/>\nPS2 disks?
