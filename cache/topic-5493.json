Here<br/>\n  is my current concern...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Since we began unschooling Adrian&#39;s intersts have been changing.<br/>\n  Normal, I know, and a very positive thing indeed.  I do not limit<br/>\n  television or video games or food or anything.  He is an excellent<br/>\n  desision maker because of this, I&#39;m sure.  PS2 and computer games<br/>\n  are a passion for him, and he absolutely loves Adult Swim cartoons<br/>\n  and South Park.  Also, bear in mind that he is number seven, and the<br/>\n  other six are all PS children...out of my control...even longer<br/>\n  story.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, Adrian has a very mature sense of humor.

I&#39;m Tina, unschooling mom to Adrian, 11 years old.  <br/>\nWe have been unschooling for a year and a half now.  I am SO HAPPY <br/>\nwe discovered unschooling.  It has been an extreme pleasure watching <br/>\nhim grow and come &quot;out of his shell&quot; so to speak.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I&#39;ve not had much trouble adjusting in regard <br/>\nto &quot;schoolish&quot; type subjects &quot;being missed&quot;.  I know that&#39;s not the <br/>\ncase and am very comfortable with our decision to unschool.  <br/>\nDeschooling was a very enjoyable process for the both of us, I do <br/>\nbelieve.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this is where my concern is lying now.  I&#39;ve no experience <br/>\nor concrete references in relation to &quot;parenting issues&quot;, for lack <br/>\nof better wording, as it relates to an unschooling lifestyle.  Here <br/>\nis my current concern...<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we began unschooling Adrian&#39;s intersts have been changing.  <br/>\nNormal, I know, and a very positive thing indeed.  I do not limit <br/>\ntelevision or video games or food or anything.  He is an excellent <br/>\ndesision maker because of this, I&#39;m sure.  PS2 and computer games <br/>\nare a passion for him, and he absolutely loves Adult Swim cartoons <br/>\nand South Park.  Also, bear in mind that he is number seven, and the <br/>\nother six are all PS children...out of my control...even longer <br/>\nstory.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Adrian has a very mature sense of humor.  He likes to share <br/>\nlittle snippits from cartoons he&#39;s watched that he finds <br/>\nparticularly funny.  He also likes to tell more mature jokes and has <br/>\na very dry sense of humor.  The flip side is that he carries on very <br/>\nadult conversations and can make nearly anyone pause for thought <br/>\nwith his opinions.  He is an interesting kid to converse with.  This <br/>\nis where my question is...how do I teach him tact without squelching <br/>\nthe self-esteem and level of comfort he&#39;s established in sharing <br/>\nconveration with others?  I want him to feel free to talk about <br/>\nwhat&#39;s on his mind.  BUT, I also want him to learn that some things <br/>\njust aren&#39;t appropriate to talk about with certain people.  Not <br/>\neveryone is going to find his jokes or the scenes from South Park <br/>\namusing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone share anything with me on this?  Has anyone been there, <br/>\ndone that?  Do you know of any resources I can utilize?  I&#39;m an avid <br/>\nreader and regular at the library.  Any imput is welcome and wanted <br/>\nas this is new territory for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5588,"nextTopicId":5618}}
