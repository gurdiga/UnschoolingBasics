You are just getting<br/>\nthe worse case scenario at least from me.  In reality though, My daughter<br/>\nREALLY wanted a little sister and she got 3 brothers instead.  This has<br/>\nreally annoyed her, but what she doesn&#39;t realize is that a baby sister would<br/>\nhave been the same way.  Many siblings don&#39;t really get along in the younger<br/>\nyears due to developmental differences and the lack of understanding that<br/>\nthey actually have developmental differences.  (Dana from Montana is<br/>\ncertainly the exception not the rule - she has great kids by the sounds of<br/>\nit which never fight- lucky)<br/>\nSo, in regards to feelings when the new baby actually gets here; yes we did<br/>\nsee a big change with Priscilla.  She was really great towards her brother&#39;s<br/>\nwhen they were infants, but once they became mobile and opinionated she<br/>\nbegan not to like it so much.

It is important for them to be able to set<br/>\n  limits for themselves and this is an opportunity for them to practice<br/>\n  in a safe place. It is a game until one chooses to stop it. THEN it<br/>\n  needs to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My friend&#39;s three year old was playing &quot;trolls&quot; (some made up &quot;get-<br/>\n  you&quot; type game) with his older brothers. They were all having fun. It<br/>\n  was getting rowdy so she told them to stop. Why? They were all<br/>\n  disappointed. She said she didn&#39;t want it to go any further. Perhaps<br/>\n  wanting the behavior to stop is actually yourself as a child wanting<br/>\n  someone to rescue you. That is your history and baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT, you ARE there for them. There is no &quot;lost cause&quot; for them IF<br/>\n  they ask for your help. Their life is different. It sounds like you<br/>\n  are sensitive to this fear of it going too far and it becoming<br/>\n  a &quot;lost cause&quot;. Perhaps, use that sensitivity for listening to them<br/>\n  rather than stepping in unless it IS a family safety issue. Share<br/>\n  your experiences and feeling about the issues of not feeling heard.<br/>\n  Reassure them that you are available when they ask for help. Perhaps<br/>\n  you could share some phrases on how to ask for the play to be &#39;more<br/>\n  gentle&#39;, &#39;slow down&#39; or &#39;quit&#39;, &#39;it&#39;s not fun&#39;, &#39;I want to stop&#39;, IF<br/>\n  THEY WANT IT TO CHANGE. These are empowering tools that can be<br/>\n  carried with them even when you are not with them directly.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t interfere when my son is playing. I try to empower him to use<br/>\n  his words, leave the situation or ask for help. He knows that I will<br/>\n  be available whenever he needs me. I want to be a trusted advisor and<br/>\n  resource, not the one in charge.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Pat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;G&M Contracting Inc.,<br/>\n  Kenneth Gillilan&quot; &lt;gmcontractinginc@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; &gt;&gt;We have a principle here: Be Kind.

It is important for them to be able to set <br/>\nlimits for themselves and this is an opportunity for them to practice <br/>\nin a safe place. It is a game until one chooses to stop it. THEN it <br/>\nneeds to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend&#39;s three year old was playing &quot;trolls&quot; (some made up &quot;get-<br/>\nyou&quot; type game) with his older brothers. They were all having fun. It <br/>\nwas getting rowdy so she told them to stop. Why? They were all <br/>\ndisappointed. She said she didn&#39;t want it to go any further. Perhaps <br/>\nwanting the behavior to stop is actually yourself as a child wanting <br/>\nsomeone to rescue you. That is your history and baggage. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, you ARE there for them. There is no &quot;lost cause&quot; for them IF <br/>\nthey ask for your help. Their life is different. It sounds like you <br/>\nare sensitive to this fear of it going too far and it becoming <br/>\na &quot;lost cause&quot;. Perhaps, use that sensitivity for listening to them <br/>\nrather than stepping in unless it IS a family safety issue. Share <br/>\nyour experiences and feeling about the issues of not feeling heard. <br/>\nReassure them that you are available when they ask for help. Perhaps <br/>\nyou could share some phrases on how to ask for the play to be &#39;more <br/>\ngentle&#39;, &#39;slow down&#39; or &#39;quit&#39;, &#39;it&#39;s not fun&#39;, &#39;I want to stop&#39;, IF <br/>\nTHEY WANT IT TO CHANGE. These are empowering tools that can be <br/>\ncarried with them even when you are not with them directly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t interfere when my son is playing. I try to empower him to use <br/>\nhis words, leave the situation or ask for help. He knows that I will <br/>\nbe available whenever he needs me. I want to be a trusted advisor and <br/>\nresource, not the one in charge. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;G&M Contracting Inc., <br/>\nKenneth Gillilan&quot; &lt;gmcontractinginc@v...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;We have a principle here: Be Kind.

With that said:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; You cannot change your children or their personalities.  You can  <br/>\nchange your <br/>\n&gt; perception of their situation.  Their dynamics are known only  to <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; individual child.  You can &quot;try&quot; to help them find coping  <br/>\nstrategies, but since the <br/>\n&gt; dynamics and their needs change from day to day or  moment by <br/>\nmoment, that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; like spinning your wheels in most cases too.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It is often our discomfort at the noise or the tears or the day to <br/>\nday life  <br/>\n&gt; with that many personalities under one roof that leads us to search <br/>\nfor  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;solutions&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Here are the things I&#39;ve tried to keep in mind, while mindfully  <br/>\nparenting:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 1)  Each of your children is learning something valuable from the  <br/>\nothers. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 2)  You cannot be all things to all of your children at all  <br/>\nmoments.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 3)  Each of your children was an infant that needed you totally at <br/>\none  time <br/>\n&gt; - they&#39;ve all ready had that and sometimes they need to &quot;wait&quot;. Now <br/>\nit is  <br/>\n&gt; this baby&#39;s turn and any subsequent babies after this one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 4)  The less you try to referee now, the more able they will become <br/>\nin  <br/>\n&gt; solving their own issues.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; 5)  They may grow up to be best friends without your  interference.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It is hard to watch our children when we perceive them to be <br/>\nneeding or  <br/>\n&gt; hurting, but remember - they are your perceptions and vast amounts <br/>\nwill be  <br/>\n&gt; learned if you lovingly support, offer kindness and gentleness and <br/>\nlet them  chart <br/>\n&gt; their own way.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Good luck!<br/>\n&gt; Linda S.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping the peace","postDate":"1090958591","msgId":2348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlkLjRiNjI0ZTdmLjJlMzgwZWZmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2346,"nextInTopic":2349,"prevInTime":2347,"nextInTime":2349,"topicId":2335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1311888490\">&lt;&lt;The older they are the more creative they get about the picking.

Their dynamics are known only  to the <br/>\nindividual child.

Now it is  <br/>\nthis baby&#39;s turn and any subsequent babies after this one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n4)  The less you try to referee now, the more able they will become in  <br/>\nsolving their own issues.<br/>\n <br/>\n5)  They may grow up to be best friends without your  interference.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is hard to watch our children when we perceive them to be needing or  <br/>\nhurting, but remember - they are your perceptions and vast amounts will be  <br/>\nlearned if you lovingly support, offer kindness and gentleness and let them  chart <br/>\ntheir own way.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nLinda S.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping the peace","postDate":"1090936113","msgId":2338,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlOS4yNjAyYzc2Yy4yZTM3YjczMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2337,"nextInTopic":2339,"prevInTime":2337,"nextInTime":2339,"topicId":2335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/27/2004 8:11:24 AM Eastern Standard Time, gmcontractinginc@verizon.net writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-695083988\">In a message dated 7/27/2004 8:11:24 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gmcontractinginc@...\">gmcontractinginc@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n   &lt;&lt; I have 4 kids 11, 5, 3.5 & 1.

My 11 and 5 year old do not really get along very<br/>\nwell.  They both have outgoing personalities and love to be the leader, so<br/>\nyou can imagine this could cause some problems.  My sons 5 & 3.5 love to get<br/>\neach other going.  5 year old sees a toy that 3.5 year old is using and will<br/>\nfind some way to take it from him or relentlessly ask him for it over and<br/>\nover again just to bug him.  My 3.5 year old has a great high pitched scream<br/>\nas well.  Whenever my 1 year old hears these arguments he has an interesting<br/>\nreaction.  He often yells really loud until his siblings look at him or he<br/>\nruns up to them and bites them.  Oddly enough when they see him coming they<br/>\nbreak up the argument and that&#39;s the end of it for at least the next 5<br/>\nminutes or so.  I tell them that they&#39;re arguing is frustrating him and he&#39;s<br/>\njust telling you all to be quiet, but they seem to think it&#39;s funny.<br/>\n    I do notice that most of the time when this happens a change of scenery<br/>\nis all that&#39;s needed.  They rarely argue outside.  My husband has a much<br/>\nlower threshold for the bickering than I do.  Sometimes when they are all<br/>\nrunning around like banshees at our dinner time ( my husband and I like to<br/>\neat at a certain time, but the kids don&#39;t have a schedule) he asks me if he<br/>\ncan turn one of our rooms in to a padded room and lock them in. He says this<br/>\nin jest of course.  I kind of agree with the padded room though, wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthat be a blast!  Not locked in of course.<br/>\n    Anyway all this might not sound very reassuring, but I really do see<br/>\nprogress.  They have been finding subtle ways of working it out on their own<br/>\nsometimes.  When they do I just casually let them know that I&#39;m glad they<br/>\nworked it out and we just naturally move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, July 27, 2004 7:38 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Keeping the peace<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have a question that has been lingering for a while.
