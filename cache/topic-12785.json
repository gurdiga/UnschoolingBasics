You feel good  about <br/>\nit. The kids are starting to get it.  It&#39;s okay if in a friendly way  you <br/>\nexpress that Dad doesn&#39;t understand unschooling yet, so he&#39;s going to need  time.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the meantime, don&#39;t worry about his getting unschooling -- help him  <br/>\nfigure out ways to communicate with the kids that won&#39;t make the kids feel  <br/>\nsquashed. I&#39;d ask him to read something like &quot;Liberated Parents, Liberated  Children&quot; <br/>\nor  &quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will  Talk&quot; by Faber <br/>\nand Mazlish.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe thing about all this stuff is that it can be scary! Your husband was  <br/>\npsyched when your son had this goal because it made him feel safe.  He  could <br/>\ntell people that his 12 year old son was studying because he wants to  finish <br/>\nhigh school and go to college early. He WILL get it, but he needs time to  see it <br/>\nin action. Think about it....you&#39;ve read here for a long time, and just  NOW <br/>\nyou&#39;ve become passionate. <br/>\n <br/>\nAsk him to look for stuff that your kids are doing that seem cool, or to  <br/>\nfind things that they can do together that will be fun. Ask him to be gentle in  <br/>\nhis communications with them. Tell him you&#39;ll try to be patient as he goes  <br/>\nthrough HIS process.<br/>\n <br/>\nI suspect your son&#39;s interest in the GED was a kind of Prodigy Complex. He  <br/>\nliked the idea of entering college really, really young...that would seem  <br/>\nimpressive!  He might be a kid who would really like a big, flashy project  that <br/>\ncould get him a lot of attention. That&#39;s not a bad thing. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s going to be okay. He sounds like he&#39;s a nice guy who adores his kids,  <br/>\nand you. Changes, good, bad, big, little can be challenging.

Then, with any luck, he&#39;ll remember just before it<br/>\ncomes out his mouth and he&#39;ll stop himself.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he won&#39;t read then keep talking to him, but let it be in little<br/>\nsnippets and not in an &quot;I&#39;m here to educate you&quot; kind of way but in the<br/>\nway you&#39;d share any interesting thing with him.  Let your own<br/>\nconversations with your kids be an example to him of happy, stress free<br/>\ncommunication. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t have to understand it all right now in order to stop causing<br/>\nstress.
