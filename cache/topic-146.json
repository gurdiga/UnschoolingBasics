In their attempt to get him to read. He thought it was fun at first, but when they refused to get him any more of the books until he had proved to them that he could read them. He stoped playing with it(they were sooo pissed we wouldn&#39;t make him do it the right way and didn&#39;t have him sitting down everyday doing it).
