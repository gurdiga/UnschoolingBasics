I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-582446412\">&quot;Are unschoolers saying that<br/>\nthey can ALWAYS trust their children to make the best choice&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I always trust MYSELF to make the best choice? Yes and no. <br/>\nI always (as do my children) TRY to make the best choice with the<br/>\ntools and experience I have in the moment. Hindsight often shows me<br/>\nwhere I could have done it better or different, that&#39;s what we call<br/>\nlearning.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI trust that my children are doing the best they can under the<br/>\ncircumstances. I don&#39;t trust they always have the tools and experience<br/>\nnecessary to navigate every situation, and that&#39;s why they need<br/>\nparents to assist them. ASSIST, not force. I can get downright<br/>\ncoercive if I need to keep a person safe or stop anything physical<br/>\nbetween my children. Coercive can still be done in a more respectful<br/>\nmanner though.........no, I&#39;m not going to let you hit your sister,<br/>\nbut yes, I understand how upset you are right now let&#39;s get some space<br/>\nfrom this situation type thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunscreen is overrated if you ask me! It gives people a false sense of<br/>\nsafety in regards to UV rays. You are still bombarded with the cancer<br/>\ncausing rays, so I don&#39;t think it needs to be an either/or situation.<br/>\nAnytime we draw a sand in the line and say &quot;don&#39;t cross this or else&quot;<br/>\nwe are setting up an adversarial situation. Doesn&#39;t need to happen<br/>\nthat way. Joyce explained it so thoroughly and clearly I&#39;m not even<br/>\ngoing to attempt another explanation.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie issue; we have children that have a variety of taste in<br/>\nmovies. My two older still enjoy some pretty violent films, with no<br/>\nill effects. My 9y.o. does not enjoy extreme violence, but is<br/>\nbeginning to be less sensitive to movie violence as she gets older. My<br/>\n5 y.o. is not bothered by much of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeciding what they can and can&#39;t watch based on age would be<br/>\npointless. What I HAVE done is warn them about content and be present<br/>\nfor them. It isn&#39;t the end of the world to see something a bit beyond<br/>\nyour comfort zone when you know the adults in the home are going to<br/>\nsupport you and help you cope with it. My children don&#39;t have any<br/>\ndesire to watch the things that bother them, since it IS their choice<br/>\nand I&#39;m here to facilitate anything that fascinates them rather than<br/>\nforbid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17271,"nextTopicId":17185}}
