He has always been a mature, cool,<br/>\nlaid back kinda guy.  He&#39;s not really loud or rowdy, likes books<br/>\nmovies, music and art lately he&#39;s into spiderman and more &quot;guyish&quot;<br/>\nthings.  The supposed terrible twos were just a non issue for him, he<br/>\nnever has/had tantrums or fits, jjust not his style.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Recently (last couple of weeks) he is having 1 to 3 major breakdowns<br/>\nper day..on days that he skips nap.  I know the cause...this doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen until after he has skipped his nap.  He was a 3 hr per day<br/>\nnapper until this summer and now he skips his nap a few times a<br/>\nweek...we try to get him to bed earlier but it doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>\n ANYWAY - these breakdown are most of the time over something &quot;small&quot;<br/>\n(though to him it&#39;s huge).  I think I see the pattern here and I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen getting the baby down for nap and then he and I lie in my bed<br/>\ntogether for his nap...he just never goes to sleep.  So eventually we<br/>\nget up and then later something sets him off and he goes nuts.  <br/>\n&gt; Also, we&#39;ve tried &quot;quiet time&quot; in place of nap...today for example,<br/>\nwe went to lie down 30 min later he&#39;s still awake and saying he doesnt<br/>\nneed a nap, we agree on a movie in bed so that he can rest with his<br/>\n&quot;blankie&quot; and I can take care of some things before baby wakes. <br/>\nEverything was fine...until after lunch.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His sister spilled his raisins and he went into FULL scream &quot;i want<br/>\nmy raisins&quot;.  I knew he was getting fired up and I wnated to help him<br/>\nget calm so I led him to his room to get a hold of himself, we<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t even talk with him in hysterics like that...he stayed in his<br/>\nroom screaming the same phrase for about 3 minutes.  He came out, we<br/>\ntalked briefly about being so tired etc and he was fine for several hours.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Not sure...is this normal 3 yr old behavior? <br/>\n&gt; I think next time, i will try to just hold him before he completely<br/>\nlooses it, that may prevent it.  I&#39;ll have to see.  Maybe being in his<br/>\nroom makes it worse. <br/>\n&gt; I would not have a problem with him skipping every nap BUT to me,<br/>\nit&#39;s pretty obvious that he needs the rest.

Remember <br/>\nwhen your child first started crawling?  They&#39;d crawl away from you and <br/>\nexplore a bit but often crawled back to Mama to reconnect.  I think <br/>\nit&#39;s similar to that, but in a more mental than physical way.  HTH<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax.  Your son is fine.  :)<br/>\n-Tracy-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138862876,"authorName":"Geneva Goza","from":"&quot;Geneva Goza&quot; &lt;goza@...&gt;","profile":"nevagoza","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"question about my son","postDate":"1092291106","msgId":2709,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODEwMWM0ODAzMyQ0MDI1NGJkMCQ1YzY2MzNkOEBnb3phPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2717,"prevInTime":2708,"nextInTime":2710,"topicId":2709,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope I can fit all this info into a quick ameil.

I&#39;m so busy these days...I love reading everyone&#39;s posts and advice but I never seem to have time for my own.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Echo is 3 yrs and 8 mos.  He has always been a mature, cool, laid back kinda guy.  He&#39;s not really loud or rowdy, likes books movies, music and art lately he&#39;s into spiderman and more &quot;guyish&quot; things.  The supposed terrible twos were just a non issue for him, he never has/had tantrums or fits, jjust not his style.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently (last couple of weeks) he is having 1 to 3 major breakdowns per day..on days that he skips nap.  I know the cause...this doesn&#39;t happen until after he has skipped his nap.  He was a 3 hr per day napper until this summer and now he skips his nap a few times a week...we try to get him to bed earlier but it doesn&#39;t always happen.  ANYWAY - these breakdown are most of the time over something &quot;small&quot; (though to him it&#39;s huge).  I think I see the pattern here and I&#39;ve been getting the baby down for nap and then he and I lie in my bed together for his nap...he just never goes to sleep.  So eventually we get up and then later something sets him off and he goes nuts.  <br/>\nAlso, we&#39;ve tried &quot;quiet time&quot; in place of nap...today for example, we went to lie down 30 min later he&#39;s still awake and saying he doesnt need a nap, we agree on a movie in bed so that he can rest with his &quot;blankie&quot; and I can take care of some things before baby wakes.  Everything was fine...until after lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis sister spilled his raisins and he went into FULL scream &quot;i want my raisins&quot;.  I knew he was getting fired up and I wnated to help him get calm so I led him to his room to get a hold of himself, we couldn&#39;t even talk with him in hysterics like that...he stayed in his room screaming the same phrase for about 3 minutes.  He came out, we talked briefly about being so tired etc and he was fine for several hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure...is this normal 3 yr old behavior? <br/>\nI think next time, i will try to just hold him before he completely looses it, that may prevent it.  I&#39;ll have to see.  Maybe being in his room makes it worse. <br/>\nI would not have a problem with him skipping every nap BUT to me, it&#39;s pretty obvious that he needs the rest.  If a kid doesnt want to nap and can handle daily stress fine but I really think he is simply &quot;grouchy&quot; and tired.  He stays up until 9 or 10 and wakes at 9am.  hope someone can lead us in the right direction here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m worried about him - he&#39;s NEVER done this until recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2793,"nextTopicId":2796}}
