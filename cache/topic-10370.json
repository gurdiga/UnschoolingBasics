For instance.. I may try to have the glasses feel like  pretend <br/>\ngoggles or a mask that children play with. My 2 yr old wears a pair of  safety <br/>\ngoggles often for fun. He loves the strap and the silly feel. I may being  <br/>\nthe seriousness of the situation try to recruit the other children (if you have  <br/>\nany) to play the glasses play also. Like have a few pair with regular lens  <br/>\nso they can help. Or even you can do it.<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t like to be controlled and if they feel that they will revolt  <br/>\naway from what we want or need them to do.  <br/>\nI hope the next couple months resolves the situation. <br/>\n <br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\nunschoolingMaine.com<br/>\n***************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My DD(with T21) who will be three next month needs  glasses.
