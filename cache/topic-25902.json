HA!    My girls have completely<br/>\nbeen turned off of organized religion because of him and his extended<br/>\nfamily (you know the type in church everytime the doors are open,<br/>\nwriting checks for any cause related to a church, but constantly judge<br/>\nothers, treat everyone around like crap and behave however they&#39;d like<br/>\nbecause I guess they are forgiven! UGH!)     While I commend you for<br/>\nhaving such a calm center and being able to see that things like<br/>\npraying for the kids  and even the going to hell comments might be<br/>\ncoming from a place of caring for my FIL it&#39;s about control... can I<br/>\nmake you do what I want because I am bigger, louder, the parent etc<br/>\netc.   Nothing this man does is coming from a place other than his<br/>\ndesire to control everything and everyone around him.   I do think<br/>\nthat most folks that offer a prayer, or express concern about<br/>\nreligious training for our children are expressing their concerns from<br/>\na place of love and caring.   I feel much more respected by someone<br/>\nwho asks if they may pray for us than someone who says &quot;if you prayed<br/>\nhard enough or were a good enough Christian your autistic child with a<br/>\ngenetic syndrome would be healed&quot; like my FIL is fond of doing.
