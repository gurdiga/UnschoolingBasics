Rather than waiting for her to &#39;move on&#39;, get doing yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird thing I wanted to say was broaden your scope of what &#39;counts&#39; as <br/>\nreading. Odds are she is reading more than you are noticing because <br/>\nyou&#39;re focused on book reading. What is it she ENJOYS doing? Odds are <br/>\nthat somewhere along the way, there are words involved (videogame <br/>\ninstructions, shopping catalogs, whatever). It&#39;s unlikely she&#39;s <br/>\nspending 24/7 staring at the wall - so ask her what you can do <br/>\nwith/for her (including just getting out of her way for a while) - <br/>\nwould she really really like to get outdoors more, go for walks in the <br/>\nwoods, or whatever? or listen to different types of music? or spend <br/>\ntime with animals? or learn to sew or knit or carve fancy pumpkins? <br/>\nWhatever it is, be a resource to get those things - you&#39;ve got the car <br/>\nkeys and credit cards but let her lead - you push the cart, let her <br/>\nfill it. Avoid the temptation to jump in and take over the idea (by <br/>\ngoing out and getting a bunch of how to books and supplies and setting <br/>\nit all up and then pushing her at it) - just sit back and give her <br/>\nspace and time. If she feels like she&#39;s being pushed, even if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t think you&#39;re pushing, you&#39;re pushing as far as she&#39;s concerned. <br/>\nMaybe find a time to just go out for coffee together or something and <br/>\ntalk - being in the car is great for talking because you don&#39;t have to <br/>\nlook at the other person the whole time. I know when I was growing up, <br/>\nMom would often approach difficult topics in the car because it was <br/>\neasier to talk then - no outside interference (except driving of <br/>\ncourse but no phones, TV, siblings, etc) and maybe pose a &#39;fun&#39; <br/>\nquestion - do you ever think people will live on Mars? what would you <br/>\ndo with 24 hrs to spend a million dollars? where in the world would <br/>\nyou most like to live? to vacation? Who (living or dead) would you <br/>\nmost like to have dinner with? what would be an ideal vacation? Or, <br/>\nmaybe, suggest you play &quot;the story game&quot; (as DS calls it) - each <br/>\nperson contributes a sentence then the next person goes so you build a <br/>\nstory one sentence at a time. It can take all sorts of wild turns and <br/>\nget really funny or serious or spooky or whatever. A few years ago, we <br/>\nhad a multi chapter story of &quot;King Hiam&quot; going with DS - he&#39;d remember <br/>\nwhere we left off and we&#39;d continue from there next time we were in <br/>\nthe car for a time. King Hiam decided that all kids had to go to <br/>\nschool but there was a gentle loving family out in the middle of the <br/>\nforest who didn&#39;t send their kids to school (DS&#39; idea). When the king <br/>\nfound out, he went to see them, and in the end (many chapters later) <br/>\nKing Hiam rescinded his rule and let families choose what they wanted <br/>\nto do, including unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Can you Deschool to long?","postDate":"1161741759","msgId":18549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVobWdqdit1aTltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOEM1RUUxNjAyRUNDNi1ENDQtN0FCNUBGV00tRDQxLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18548,"nextInTopic":18551,"prevInTime":18548,"nextInTime":18550,"topicId":18534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just FUN stiff.

Jan will be 2  yrs.  When we <br/>\ncame home we did school at home for about 3mnths and then  stopped doing <br/>\neverything.  At the time I didnt realize their even was this  term deschooling.  <br/>\nMy daughter was pulled out midway through 1st grade BUT  she did 3 (hanging <br/>\nhead in sadness over losing so much time with her) yrs of  full day prek at our <br/>\npublic school starting at age 3.  My son was mid year  Kindergarten and had 1 <br/>\nyr of prek.  My son who is now 7 seems to be doing  great, finding interests, <br/>\nlearning from anything and everything.  My  daughter who is 9 though gets <br/>\nhorrible headaches when anything is too  schooly  for her. She even lately has been <br/>\ntelling me she doesnt want me to  read to her because she feels like im <br/>\npushing her to read and she just cant take  the stress.  So my question is can you <br/>\ndeschool too long?  If so how  do you move forward?  Thanks<br/>\n <br/>\nChrissy in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14885,"nextTopicId":18504}}
