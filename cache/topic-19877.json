Both dh and I have siblings, and  we would <br/>\nwant NONE of them to be guardians for our children.  So I started  making <br/>\nfriends.  We were new to NC and I knew of no unschooling  families.  I put myself out <br/>\nthere and they appeared.  I have a large  circle of unschooling friends now.  <br/>\nBut in getting to know them over the  years it made the decision about <br/>\nguardianship easy.  We have chosen friends  as guardians.  They know my children <br/>\nmore than any family member, they live  consensually so I know my boys thoughts, <br/>\nfeelings ideas etc would be taken  seriously.  They unschool.  And I can see <br/>\nhow they live with their own  children, how they problem solve, how they parent <br/>\netc.  That is the most  comforting thing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI see family, either side, maybe once every couple of years.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe did put it in writing, in our wills.  With a brief couple of  sentences <br/>\njust saying that we trust this couple and have seen them parent their  own <br/>\nchildren, and we feel this couple would make the best fit for our children  <br/>\n(something like that).  I know feelings would be hurt if the will were ever  read, <br/>\nbut my children are my priority, not hurt feelings. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, just a couple of thoughts,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19788,"nextTopicId":19748}}
