He does spots on his show where he writes letters, some have been to the FCC, to Pat Roberts.  Always entertaining!<br/>\nAnyway, last night in his letter he expressed his feelings as to the fact that nothing he learned in school was relevant to living his life now, and that everything he knows now he has had to learn ON HIS OWN.  Of course there was lots of very colorful language thrown in there, but it was so fun to listen to.  He should have been unschooled! :)<br/>\nI tried to find the link so I could post that letter on my blog, but haven&#39;t been able to find it yet.  His show airs on the IFC, so you can find more about it (if ya want to!) on ifc.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond affirmation came to me today in the form of a quote, here it is, enjoy it!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The world is round.
