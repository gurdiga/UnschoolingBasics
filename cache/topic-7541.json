Tutors are another option, which I bet you could find rather inexpensively from a local college, maybe even trading services if you don&#39;t have money to pay them. Even though I studied math through trig/analytical geometery in grammar school when I finally decided to go to college I had to redo the math classes starting at Algebra. Another example of how things work in the &quot;real&quot; world. My oldest son, who is almost 17, never did well in math in school. He had a really hard time with percentages and fractions and decimals and never really got any further than that in school. Now that he is facing real world applications of those things he&#39;s able to figure them out in his head. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

And if a kid seems to really  <br/>\nenjoy and be interested in how to figure out how to add two fractions  <br/>\ntogether, you&#39;d help him with that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe danger I see is that so many parents have school-induced math  <br/>\nanxiety that causes them to avoid math. If you&#39;re avoiding it, you  <br/>\nARE doing your kids a disservice. Try to treat math JUST like you&#39;d  <br/>\ntreat reading. So - gosh - do you snuggle up and enjoy each other&#39;s  <br/>\ncompany while you read together? Why not snuggle up and enjoy reading  <br/>\nbooks that include mathematics? There are a LOT of really good ones.  <br/>\nBut math-anxious parents MIGHT avoid those books if they&#39;re not aware  <br/>\nof their own avoidance tendencies - so you might want to make a  <br/>\nspecial effort to INCLUDE more math-related reading material.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - if you&#39;re just having fun around the house, some families will  <br/>\nplay with &quot;ingredients&quot; and do what amounts to science experiments  <br/>\n(mixing GAK and talking/thinking about it, cleaning pennies with  <br/>\nvinegar, making underwater-viewers out of milk cartons, and so on).  <br/>\nSome families will have lots of animals to care for and enjoy (and  <br/>\nlearn about). Some will listen to a lot of music. Most of us will try  <br/>\nto at least &quot;offer&quot; (strew) all kinds of different things as we  <br/>\ncreate a rich and stimulating environment. But parents with math- <br/>\nanxiety MIGHT avoid strewing/offering/bringing up things that seem  <br/>\nmath-related. So a conscious effort to include fun math-related  <br/>\nactivities might be needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we adults were already so screwed up by having had many years of  <br/>\nschool math, which effectively sucked all the potential joy out of  <br/>\nmathematics for most people, special efforts to include math in our  <br/>\nunschooling lives would not be needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - trying to be realistic, I think it is a good idea for  <br/>\nunschooling parents to make sure they&#39;re not filtering math-related  <br/>\nstuff OUT of their kids&#39; lives, by choosing consciously to include it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m guessing you have math fears because you yourself have problems<br/>\n&gt; with math?

Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a kid who likes biographies, there are two volumes of  <br/>\n&quot;Mathematicians are People, too,&quot; which are great!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some really wonderful picture books that are math-related.  <br/>\nI just mixed these in with all the other picture books we read and  <br/>\nread and read - and some because my young children&#39;s favorites.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe arithmetic that is normally learned from Kindergarten through 6th  <br/>\nor 7th grade is USEFUL - it&#39;ll come up in real life because it IS  <br/>\nuseful.
