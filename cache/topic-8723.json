My kids have a lot of &quot;chores&quot; but they chose to take them on themselves when they wanted to raise livestock for stockshows.  They could choose not to do shows tomorrow and the &quot;chores&quot; would stop, but as long as we have animals, they must be fed, groomed, pens cleaned, etc..  (These were family decisions made prior to ever getting animals, not some mandate by parents.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has much more to do with attitudes toward what you do.  What if your son rolled his eyes at Sherlock Holmes?  Are you invested in  your son being &quot;exposed&quot; to that?  If my kids wanted to get rid of the animals and spend all day playing video games, I would have no problem (to be honest, some days I long for that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: sahm2cody &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:CXFiles@...\">CXFiles@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, January 4, 2006 12:23 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Am I an unschooler?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This may seem like a stupid question, but honestly, I don&#39;t know <br/>\n&gt; what <br/>\n&gt; to call us.

That &quot;unschooling&quot; is a style of *homeschooling*, and &quot;radical unschooling&quot; is a whole way of life?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Either way, I think it&#39;s silly that people are debating your &quot;unschooly-ness&quot; (I know...no way *that* is a word)!  It&#39;s not really anyone else&#39;s business, is it?  As far as getting together with other families, you mightfeel more comfortable with other families who take a relaxed approach to homeschooling, or who are eclectic, or who are out and proud unschoolers, etc.  But I don&#39;t see how it matters IRL.  What are they gonna do...ban you from co-op?  Pin a scarlet letter on ya if they find that you ordered from a homeschool supply company? :-)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m not trying to belittle your situation, obviously ...I just think our kids are often more &quot;with it&quot; than us adults, who can act pretty silly sometimes!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Paige in VA...who&#39;s pretty sure we&#39;re radical unschoolers! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
