He<br/>\nand his wife are so committed to sharing the joy of unschooling that<br/>\nlong after their son was off on his own, they still opened up their<br/>\nhome to fellow unschoolers as a gathering space/place. Going to their<br/>\nhome was like attending a mini conference every other month! I have<br/>\nsuch gratitude for having had known him.<br/>\nWhile I will need a little<br/>\ntime to express my sadness more fully in his passing, I am passing<br/>\nalong the kind words that were written by someone who knew him well.<br/>\nMy sincerest condolences go out to his family. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\n<br/>\nErika<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.&quot;-MLK<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am learning all the time, the tombstone will be my diploma&quot;- Eartha Kitt<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Memoriam<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is with great sadness that we inform our supporters that a great friend<br/>\nand homeschool freedom champion, Ned Vare, has died.   Ned was a fearless<br/>\nfighter for educational freedom.  I first met him in 1990 when he was in the<br/>\nforefront of the effort to defeat government regulation of homeschooling in<br/>\nConnecticut.  He was wise to all the background, history, and rationale<br/>\nbehind public schooling and homeschooling.  Over the years, he not only<br/>\neducated me on the ways of the educational world, but educated untold<br/>\nothers.  He and his soulmate, Luz Shosie, met in 1973 at Ned&#39;s ranch in<br/>\nSilt, Colorado.  Together they raised their son, Cassidy, without schooling,<br/>\nwith what is now called Unschooling.  In essence, they wisely guided Cassidy<br/>\nin educating himself, an experiment, they say,<br/>\n that surpassed all of their<br/>\nexpectations. Ned and Luz were inspired by the writings of John Holt, and<br/>\ntogether, they started a support group for unschoolers and operated the<br/>\nUnschoolers Unlimited &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/\">http://borntoexplore.org/unschool/</a>&gt;  Newsletter for<br/>\nmany years.  More recently Ned penned a blog entitled, &quot;School Is Hell<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://school-is-hell.blogspot.com/\">http://school-is-hell.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; &quot;. Ned could always be seen supporting<br/>\nthe right to educate in freedom at every gathering across the state, from<br/>\nhis hometown in Guilford to Hartford and beyond. Ned was never afraid to<br/>\nconfront any government official whom he believed was acting in any way to<br/>\ndeny parents their rights.  Ned was tireless in his ability to engage<br/>\nlegislators in quiet, polite, but persistent conversation educating them as<br/>\nto the<br/>\n rights of parents and why they should support educational freedom.<br/>\nNed was extremely successful at this endeavor and was instrumental in<br/>\npersuading many key legislators to support the rights of parents in<br/>\nConnecticut.  We are also fortunate that Ned, with Luz, wrote his thoughts<br/>\nabout educational freedom in a book that I proudly keep in a most prominent<br/>\nplace in my home.  It&#39;s called &quot;Smarting Us Up, the Un Dumbing of America&quot;.<br/>\nNed was a true inspiration, who had a keen wit, a most engaging personality,<br/>\nand always the nicest smile.  I was proud to call Ned my friend, and he will<br/>\nbe sorely missed.  A memorial service is planned for him at a date to be<br/>\nannounced in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n-          Deborah Stevenson - Exec.
