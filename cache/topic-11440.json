All of<br/>\nthose things can be easily made up for by staying home.  If she is wanting<br/>\nmore structured time then help her structure her time.

If she feels she is<br/>\ndoing something wrong because she is unschooled share with her what you have<br/>\nlearned and let her be around a lot of other home/unschooled kids so she<br/>\nfeels like she is part of a norm rather than a &quot;misfit.&quot;  If the majority of<br/>\nher friends are still in school then help broaden her horizons she she has a<br/>\ngroup of home/unschooled friends that she can relate to and realize that she<br/>\nisn&#39;t missing out on anything and doesn&#39; thave that constant reminder that<br/>\nshe isn&#39;t in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"uncertanties --would like opinions","postDate":"1144591070","msgId":11440,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDA5MTM1NzUwLjM3NzAucW1haWxAd2ViMzE5MTAubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11458,"prevInTime":11439,"nextInTime":11441,"topicId":11440,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I pulled Courtney out of school mid year this year.
