But given time and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1758399528\">Hi There,<br/>\n<br/>\nSince he&#39;s 4 yrs old, my now 8 yrs old kid&#39;s afraid of the dark and <br/>\nany sort of mask, so Halloween is a touchy time and subject. But given <br/>\ntime and patience, he&#39;s learning to overcome it on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid&#39;s afraid of all those wax models you get in a musuem, so when <br/>\nhe asked to go to the Madame Tussaud last year, we knew he was trying <br/>\nto work out his own fears. He&#39;s still is vary of them, infact just a <br/>\nfew weeks ago, we hd to leave the musuem we&#39;re in because he got <br/>\nspooked by a scary looking wax model of an agressive looking Queen <br/>\nBodica.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had to leave 10 minutes into 10,000 BC because son was too scared <br/>\nLOL! My kid has yet to watch any of the Pirates of the Carribean <br/>\nmovies- the scary face/mask factor again. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he amazed me when he sat thru his first Star Wars movie in the <br/>\ncinema, considering it&#39;s dark and a very long movie and Darth Vader is <br/>\nin a scary mask! LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here&#39;s to add onto Pam&#39;s awesome list. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll time favourite - Sound of Music. <br/>\nHowabout a sing-along with the new Mamma Mia?<br/>\nPolar Express<br/>\nAlvin and the Chipmunk<br/>\nFree Willy<br/>\nMeerkat Manor - a documnetary series showcasing the lives and hierachy <br/>\nof the meerkats. Very cute and entertaining. You can check it out on <br/>\nYoutube, and the full series is available thru amazon.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nYouTube - The Forbidden City- a series of re-enacted documentary on <br/>\nancient china&#39;s rulers. <br/>\n<br/>\nBi-centennial Man - Robin William playing a gentle loving home robot <br/>\nwho eventually turned into man. A feel good movie. If your kid&#39;s <br/>\nafraid of a fullsize metal walking thing, then this might not be the <br/>\nright move. Surprisingly, my kid watched this considering a talking <br/>\nmetal face can be scary. i suppose when the metal face&#39;s attached to a <br/>\nfull metal body, it&#39;s no longer classified as a scary mask. <br/>\n<br/>\nPenelope - the girl with a pig nose. A fairy tale story about a pretty <br/>\ngirl with an old family curse. Again, for my son, the mask factor is <br/>\noverlooked because it&#39;s an actual face.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHellBoy 1 - Again, success for us despite HellBoy&#39;s scary looks. But I <br/>\nsuspect it&#39;s the scene when Hellboy was first discovered, a monkey-<br/>\nlike baby creature that was friendly and vulnerable. I think my son&#39;s <br/>\nmade a connection with this scene somehow, so Hellboy wasn&#39;t so scary <br/>\nfor him afterall. No throwing up scenes as far as I can remember, but <br/>\nlots of smashing and fast actions. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarch to Glory, the story about the 300 spartans. It&#39;s ancient warfare <br/>\nwith lots of fighting and blood and human-relations and strategies. <br/>\nFor us, there was a purpose in watching it. My kid was playing this <br/>\ngame on his psp, so by watching it, it brought to life what he was <br/>\ndoing in his game. Again, he wasn&#39;t frightened off by the face masks, <br/>\nand there&#39;s quite a number of them in this movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nRush Hour 1 and 2- i know it&#39;s has rude language in it, but it&#39;s <br/>\nhillarious (more for me and hubby&#39;s benefit) and has lots of stunts <br/>\n(for son&#39;s benefit). My kid&#39;s into martial arts. So he&#39;s into any kung <br/>\nfu movies, especially Jackie Chan and Jet Li&#39;s. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo by now writing this, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if there&#39;s a pattern <br/>\nhere, that when we&#39;re watching something with a &quot;purpose to <br/>\nunderstand&quot;, other than just entertainment, maybe it provided DS with <br/>\na focus, away from his fear factor? Maybe this might work for your <br/>\nkid? <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure I&#39;ve got lots more movies in my brain but then, my brain&#39;s <br/>\nnot working today LOL! I hope this helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nHugs and best wishes to everyone,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Movie suggestions?","postDate":"1223320142","msgId":36382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDA2MTIwOXYzODJhZjg0ZWwzYjY3ZGJiMzkzYjIwYjQ5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjYmQ1MStxNmZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDhDQUY0OTkzMDU2NEZFNi0xNjQ4LUE1MEBGV00tRDEzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPgkgPGdjYmQ1MStxNmZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36380,"nextInTopic":36387,"prevInTime":36381,"nextInTime":36383,"topicId":36344,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Whereas that s not true for my 5 year old.

Also A Kid in King Arthur&#39;s Court.<br/>\nI do have to mention that Star Wars (at least 4 and 5 and 1) was not at all scary for my then 5.5 y.o. Cinderella was. He still does not want to see it. AFter watching the Star Wars Trilogy for the first time with me he did not want to see it again for a year or so. It satisfied his curiosity. Now he will sometimes watch parts of one. Usually he does not make it through a whole movie. He will watch a little, build some legos, play with toys etc. while doing it. Usually we have a lot of other things going on when watching movies, unless it is something we REALLY want to pay attention to. <br/>\nIt might be hard to keep it casual if it is something he has long wanted to do and it is a big deal. Otherwise, maybe just say, watch as much as you like and when it becomes scary we can turn it off, or fast-forward - my older son would sometimes leave the room when parts got scary and told me to call him back in when they are over. Sometimes he asked me to fast-forward certain parts. Or mute those parts and hide behind a ready-made fortress. We did read the Star Wars stories a lot in bed and there were a lot of movie pictures in it, so by the time he saw them (and after) he sort of knew what to expect by hearing and talking about it, once we watched something about the making of etc. <br/>\nOur local science museum (Boston) has a model of Anakin&#39;s ship and a whole model making section, so we could talk a lot about how models in movies. Another fun thing to watch for my sons are Lego movies online. And soon, make them. If you have a video camera you can make your own short movies and talk about how you could make things look real even if they are not (blood is a fun one -). If you have a little toy R2D2, how could you make a desert landscape and have him &#39;walk&#39; through so it would look as if he was true to size?<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helps -<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;three.moms&quot; &lt;3mommies@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Our son Ethan (age 8) really really really wants to<br/>\n&gt; watch non-animated<br/>\n&gt; &gt; movies with us.

She has never been willing to go into another part of the house<br/>\nalone due to fear (she will occasionally try if it will be a few<br/>\nseconds before I can go with her and will come running back<br/>\nimmediately saying she heard a a noise that sounded like a very large<br/>\nanimal, or whatever). She is amazingly social, however, and I think<br/>\nthat may play as big a role in that particular behavior as anything<br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she started being *really* interested in &quot;scary&quot; books and<br/>\nmovies, and it seems to me that this is part of how she is working out<br/>\nher own fear issues. For a while, she always had the mute button under<br/>\nher finger the first time she watched a movie, and that seemed to make<br/>\nall the difference in scary parts. If it was still too much for her,<br/>\nshe would hide under a blanket and ask one of us to tell her when that<br/>\npart was over. The wizard duel scene in &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot; comes to<br/>\nmind. Usually by the third time she watched she wouldn&#39;t even bother<br/>\nmuting it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs time goes on, she is more and more interested in movies with brave<br/>\ncharacters (especially kids) rather than movies that are just kind of<br/>\nscary. Her latest favorite is &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; and I have to say<br/>\nthat I agree. :) The main characters come up against all sorts of<br/>\npotentially freaky situations and usually plunge ahead roaring only to<br/>\ndiscover most scary seeming things are quite benign, or even friendly.<br/>\nI&#39;m a big Miazaki fan in general, but this one definitely seemed to be<br/>\nexactly what Larkin needed right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, now we&#39;re starting to run into trouble when Larkin wants to<br/>\nwatch something &quot;scary&quot; and it is too much for her little brother,<br/>\nFinn (1.5). Thank goodness he still naps!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there are our experiences... I&#39;ve also told Larkin anecdotes<br/>\nabout other unschooled kids as Meredith mentions and it does sometimes<br/>\nwork much better than my personal experiences. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\n<br/>\njenny<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Oct 5, 2008 at 7:48 AM, Meredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve told my kids stories from this and other unschooling lists from<br/>\n&gt; time to time - when one of them is struggling with somethng I don&#39;t,<br/>\n&gt; usually, or my grownup strategies just don&#39;t apply to young people.<br/>\n&gt; They like to hear what other kids, especially other unschoolers, do<br/>\n&gt; to solve problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15) </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Movie suggestions?","postDate":"1223222166","msgId":36358,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjYW8ybSs1cmdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjNmpyNCtvY2ppQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36356,"nextInTopic":36359,"prevInTime":36357,"nextInTime":36359,"topicId":36344,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My first suggestion would be to widen your thinking about what you assume he will freak out about....

I have a hard time predicting<br/>\nwhat might scare or freak him out versus what actually does!  <br/>\nSometimes things that seem very similar to me affect him<br/>\ndifferently... I wonder if looking at some of the movie review<br/>\nwebsites might be helpful if he is able to articulate what exactly<br/>\nbothered him about the movie.  My son can not watch someone else throw<br/>\nup in a movie... even if they are discreet or totally fake it just<br/>\nsends him into the gags!!   Also aliens make him really nervous and<br/>\nscared!   He loves Indiana Jones but we did not see the last one after<br/>\nhis sister reported that aliens were involved... he&#39;s had some time to<br/>\ndigest that information and is considering trying to watch it soon.  <br/>\n I make sure that he knows going into any movie that if he gets scared<br/>\nand wants to opt out that is fine with no judgment.  Sometimes he will<br/>\ncome and cuddle his way through something that scares him a little and<br/>\nwe talk about it and offer to stop the movie and he decides what he<br/>\nwants to do.   Also... Ghost Busters freaks me out but my son thinks<br/>\nit&#39;s hilarious so I am with your son on that one! HA!   You might try<br/>\nsome movies like Beethoven (about a bunch of St Bernards that a family<br/>\nowns), some of the older Disney movies that are people but funny<br/>\nstories, Hoot, Holes, Home Alone, Nim&#39;s Island, I can&#39;t think of more<br/>\nright now but maybe if you go with some that are funny and have some<br/>\nlevel of suspense he will get his need for more mature movies met but<br/>\nnot be frightened or freaked out.

Maybe when you feel his tension growing, suggest stopping the movie for a bit and making popcorn and drinks and moving for a few minutes away from the movie. You be the one to pause the film, don&#39;t always wait for him to do it, particularly if this is some sort of challenge to his self image. Do other things during the movie.

My kids got really into watching the &quot;making of&quot; dvd&#39;s for everything they watch...now, when something scary or unreal happens, even my 4 year old will mention that they must be using some sort of special effects and will say how cool it is.? Maybe start there?? Yoda scared my 6 y/o until he watched the making of movies, and Dobby (sp) is the only thing he&#39;s ever had nightmares about...and now he insists on watching those parts of HP because he understands the animation and special effects.? Have you explained to Ethan that the filmakers and screen writers WANT us to feel that way for those short periods of time?? Explain that the fear or whatever feeling comes up is ok and help him process it.? Turn it off to talk about it, or leave it on and talk about it, maybe that would help?? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: three.moms &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:3mommies@...\">3mommies@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSent: Fri, 3 Oct 2008 10:19 pm<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Movie suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n                  <br/>\n  <br/>\n          <br/>\n              <br/>\nOur son Ethan (age 8) really really really wants to watch non-animated<br/>\n<br/>\n  movies with us.
