Start those things you&#39;ve always <br/>\nwanted to do! Your kids may even catch your enthuasium and join in! <br/>\nI&#39;ve just started herb gardening. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to do for <br/>\na while and my youngest is enjoying it with me. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think you need more time away from your family, figure out ways <br/>\nto make that happen. Maybe a monthly lunch with friends? Maybe a class <br/>\nat a local college? Maybe late night grocery shopping with a friend? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf alone time is what you need (this is my need), get up earlier (I do <br/>\nthis) and have time alone. Stay up later than the rest of your family <br/>\nand have some time for yourself. Go late night shopping by yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side to this is...and I&#39;ve found this to be true is all <br/>\nthings unschooling), it&#39;s all in how you look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you need &quot;your own life&quot;. You do have your own life. You&#39;re not <br/>\nsharing someone else&#39;s life. It&#39;s all yours. It doesn&#39;t have to an <br/>\neither or type of thing. Either I&#39;m a stay at home mom OR I have my own <br/>\nlife. I share my life with my family...that&#39;s my life...my own life. I <br/>\nhave my own interests, just as the rest of my family members do. Like <br/>\nRen said, sometimes they overlap. I try to get time alone when I need <br/>\nit, just like the other members of my family. I&#39;m not the only one who <br/>\nneeds to be in their own head sometimes, know what I mean? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso remember that your life right now is different than it was in the <br/>\npast.
