LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelli,<br/>\n&gt; We did the same thing for a year-completely cut the<br/>\n&gt; cable service. I did it because it angered me that I<br/>\n&gt; could not select the channels I wanted, I was forced<br/>\n&gt; to purchase a whole package when I only wanted some<br/>\n&gt; of the channels in the package. I believe you should<br/>\n&gt; be able to &quot;menu select&quot; the channels you want to<br/>\n&gt; pay for. Anyway, I also noticed how much people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; conversations revolved around ficticious people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; lives in television shows, and my kids felt left out<br/>\n&gt; because they were not able to follow what the other<br/>\n&gt; kids (at school, of course) were talking about. (I<br/>\n&gt; would have preferred to raise my kids without<br/>\n&gt; television but I lost out on the issue.) What<br/>\n&gt; disgusts me is the abundance of television shows<br/>\n&gt; that revolve around the gruesome murder of someone,<br/>\n&gt; usually female. These shows are sometimes fiction,<br/>\n&gt; (like CSI) but often are crime shows depicting real<br/>\n&gt; cases of brutality against (mainly) young women.<br/>\n&gt; Personally,  I think it normalizes violence against<br/>\n&gt; women, but thats just my opini<br/>\n&gt; on. There are also shows glorifying the merits of<br/>\n&gt; cosmetic surgery, and the proliferation of &quot;airhead&quot;<br/>\n&gt; female characters who make being stupid look cool<br/>\n&gt; and desireable. Then there&#39;s the soft core porn,<br/>\n&gt; like the<br/>\n&gt; Paris-Hilton-gets-off-with-a-hamburger-during-half<br/>\n&gt; time genre, and the girls in underwear gyrating<br/>\n&gt; their crotch in the face of music artists on BET.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately my kids dont choose the History<br/>\n&gt; channel, they choose that crap. We now have limited<br/>\n&gt; cable, but the clamor is up for the full package.<br/>\n&gt; Commercials are largely annoying to me as well.<br/>\n&gt; There is a rare good one, but they play them over<br/>\n&gt; and over, sometimes back to back, and the volume<br/>\n&gt; automatically goes up when the commercials come on.<br/>\n&gt; Overall, I dont believe television has had a<br/>\n&gt; positive influence on our family life. When we got<br/>\n&gt; rid of it for that year, our conversations were more<br/>\n&gt; in-depth and stimulating and we had more choice of<br/>\n&gt; what to bring in to our living room by choosing<br/>\n&gt; movies to rent. With TV, unless you are e<br/>\n&gt; xtremely proactive with the remote, you get<br/>\n&gt; bombarded with a lot of crap. I am probably a<br/>\n&gt; minority opinion here, but I agree with the folks<br/>\n&gt; with the &quot;shoot your television&quot; bumper stickers on<br/>\n&gt; thier car. I have a close friend in England who has<br/>\n&gt; not had a TV for over four years and he feels<br/>\n&gt; getting rid of the TV is a subversive act. My advice<br/>\n&gt; is that if your kids are young enough to not miss<br/>\n&gt; it, and you dont really want or need it, dont have<br/>\n&gt; TV.

Tristan (he just turned 10) was a huge fan of &quot;One Piece&quot; on the Cartoon Network.  I have to admit that I hated the show...the voices and the jokes just grated on my nerves, and I had to leave the room when it came on.  I did a bit of searching around and found it was dubbed from original Japanese anime (many shows are like this, but the One Piece animation style is so different I didn&#39;t pick up on it at first...anyway....).<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a One Piece movie in it&#39;s original Japanese form with subtitles.  Tristan is now a HUGE anime fan and insists that all anime MUST be seen in Japanese with the original voices. ;o)  He has no issues with reading hours and hours of subtitles; it&#39;s what he prefers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we have indepth conversations about the characters, the plots, and have searched out other anime with the same voice actors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess some would argue the above is &quot;revolving our lives&quot; around fictitious characters by all our discussions, but I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  Tristan and I have found a common interest that has brought us together.  We talk about the relationships and idiosyncracies of the characters and how we see those same traits in many people we either know or have known in the past.  We make jokes about the shows.  We are a family of movies lovers, and it&#39;s not uncommon for us to start reciting lines from movies....we are now doing that with the anime (in both Japanese and English).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also brought around a huge interest in the Japanese language, especially for me!  I&#39;ve been floundering for nearly a year trying to discover what my passions are.  I found one lies with learning Japanese.  This passion has now opened me up to several other interests I haven&#39;t touched in so very long like drawing and wrtiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan has picked up a number of Japanese words with no sort of &quot;formal&quot; study (he has a much better ear than I when it comes to reading the subtitles and picking up the spoken word) and has a huge interest now in Japanese music.  He&#39;ll devour manga, come up with his own stories, and finds various anime/manga pics and challenges me to draw them.  He even crafted one of the characters out of polymer clay.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the last L&L Conference Joyce had a anime/manga cosplay funshop.  Tristan spent so much time thinking and putting his costume together, down to the smallest detail.  He had the list of items he needed to find at the thrift store, what supplies he had to buy at other stores, etc.  And he ended up being nearly a spitting image of the character (well, that&#39;s my biased &quot;mom opinion&quot; LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this from a TV show that I used to detest....go figure! ;o)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] What do you think of tv?","postDate":"1164295888","msgId":19223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjExMjMwNzMxcjdlZDJjMTZhbTk3ODZiZjRjMTFhZmNlZGNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVrMmV0YStmNmQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVrMmV0YStmNmQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19222,"nextInTopic":19229,"prevInTime":19222,"nextInTime":19224,"topicId":19204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli,<br/>\nWe did the same thing for a year-completely cut the cable service. I did it because it angered me that I could not select the channels I wanted, I was forced to purchase a whole package when I only wanted some of the channels in the package. I believe you should be able to &quot;menu select&quot; the channels you want to pay for. Anyway, I also noticed how much people&#39;s conversations revolved around ficticious people&#39;s lives in television shows, and my kids felt left out because they were not able to follow what the other kids (at school, of course) were talking about. (I would have preferred to raise my kids without television but I lost out on the issue.) What disgusts me is the abundance of television shows that revolve around the gruesome murder of someone, usually female. These shows are sometimes fiction, (like CSI) but often are crime shows depicting real cases of brutality against (mainly) young women. Personally,  I think it normalizes violence against women, but thats just my opini<br/>\non. There are also shows glorifying the merits of cosmetic surgery, and the proliferation of &quot;airhead&quot; female characters who make being stupid look cool and desireable. Then there&#39;s the soft core porn, like the Paris-Hilton-gets-off-with-a-hamburger-during-half time genre, and the girls in underwear gyrating their crotch in the face of music artists on BET. Unfortunately my kids dont choose the History channel, they choose that crap. We now have limited cable, but the clamor is up for the full package. Commercials are largely annoying to me as well. There is a rare good one, but they play them over and over, sometimes back to back, and the volume automatically goes up when the commercials come on. Overall, I dont believe television has had a positive influence on our family life. When we got rid of it for that year, our conversations were more in-depth and stimulating and we had more choice of what to bring in to our living room by choosing movies to rent. With TV, unless you are e<br/>\nxtremely proactive with the remote, you get bombarded with a lot of crap. I am probably a minority opinion here, but I agree with the folks with the &quot;shoot your television&quot; bumper stickers on thier car. I have a close friend in England who has not had a TV for over four years and he feels getting rid of the TV is a subversive act. My advice is that if your kids are young enough to not miss it, and you dont really want or need it, dont have TV. You can always get it later if you feel the need.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: Chris and Kelli Bailey &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cdbailey_99@...\">cdbailey_99@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nour family&#39;s experience (not very unschooly, i know):<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen dh and i had cable, we watched it too much. by<br/>\ntoo much, i mean it was easier to be passively<br/>\nentertained than to &quot;do&quot; anything. i spent weekdays in<br/>\nfront of decorating shows and weekend mornings in<br/>\nfront of gardening shows. i dreamed and schemed and<br/>\nspent way too much mental money, my head always full<br/>\nof projects i couldn&#39;t take on. dh spent evenings and<br/>\nweekend afternoons in front of the history channel. <br/>\n<br/>\nwe became annoyed when our cable company raised rates<br/>\ntwice in one year, so we just cut it off one day. we<br/>\nthought it would be &quot;good for the kids&quot; anyway,<br/>\nbecause frankly we didn&#39;t want them seeing all those<br/>\nawful commercials :)<br/>\n<br/>\ni didn&#39;t want an antenna on the roof (don&#39;t laugh!) so<br/>\ndh decided to get an attic antenna. weeks passed and<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t get around to it. eventually we forgot. we<br/>\nrented movies from video stores, purchased them at<br/>\nyard sales and borrowed from the library. we played<br/>\ncard games and board games after dinner and read aloud<br/>\nmuch more often. we eventually became comfortable with<br/>\nnot having cable and stopped missing it. believe it or<br/>\nnot, it took quite awhile (about three months) and now<br/>\nboth of us will tell you, if asked, that we are glad<br/>\nit worked out this way. for whatever reason the tv<br/>\ndistracted us from one another. whether we were<br/>\n&quot;addicted&quot; or watching what many consider a &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\namount of tv is up to the individual; we feel that our<br/>\nfamily benefited from us tossing the tube.<br/>\n<br/>\nnotice there&#39;s nothing here about how much tv the kids<br/>\nwere watching?!!

He is highly sensitive and very aware of the emotional<br/>\nenergy of others.

So, to put you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-292235481\">Constant turmoil sounds like a lot of pain. Far more than I would be willing <br/>\nto suffer. Certainly over what other people think about something. So, to <br/>\nput you out of your misery, I love television. I love watching different <br/>\nkinds of shows from Animal Planet sort of stuff, documentaries and nature <br/>\nprograms, to cartoons and movies and sitcoms. I find out so many more things <br/>\nmake up the world than those things I usually think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that probably isn&#39;t what you meant. So, let me reassure you, television <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stunt learning and creativity. At 2.5 years old, the worst it can do <br/>\nis... nope I can&#39;t think of a worst thing. I loved sitting with Simon and <br/>\nwatching Teletubbies. He loved Teletubbies. And I still smile at the unaging <br/>\nbaby in the face of the setting, or rising sun. When he was 2.5, gosh, 6.5 <br/>\nyears ago, I didn&#39;t really limit his television. But I did get really upset <br/>\nwhen my brother gave us a Sega Dreamcast for Christmas. I didn&#39;t think that <br/>\nwas a good influence at all. Hard to reach back to that mindset. I believed <br/>\nthat virtual violence made real violence more likely. But it didn&#39;t. Sam, my <br/>\nbrother, gave us the Dreamcast and a fishing game with the fishing rod <br/>\ncontroller so that we could practice up for fishing that summer. And slowly <br/>\nwe added to the games. We got a game where you raced by sliding on your <br/>\nbelly or on skis down a mountainside and we got Tokyo extreme racer and we <br/>\ngot some questing games, &#39;cause I like questing games. And we got Sonic the <br/>\nHedgehog games. Simon loved and still loves Sonic the Hedgehog. But, to this <br/>\nday, I&#39;ve never seen him obsessing over collecting gold rings. Simon, who is <br/>\namazing at video games, is the gentlest and sweetest boy I know--I recognize <br/>\nI&#39;m biased. He does like to play physically, but so did I and I had Pong <br/>\nwhen I was a kid. He got upset playing Mystery Dungeon, a new Pokemon game <br/>\nfor the DS, when it was suggested in the gameplay that his character might <br/>\nhave abandoned his Pokemon. He didn&#39;t play it for 2 days. Couldn&#39;t bring <br/>\nhimself to facing the idea that he was playing such a non-noble character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that is to say that I was wrong. Video games do not beget violence, and <br/>\ntelevision doesn&#39;t stunt creativity or learning. It&#39;s just lies people tell <br/>\nyou because they read it somewhere and they know in their heart of hearts <br/>\nthat learning is difficult and arduous and television and video games are <br/>\nfun and sometimes relaxing so it isn&#39;t possible that they can be learning. <br/>\nSo don&#39;t believe them. Learning is fun! and not in the sing song voice way <br/>\nthat all the hooked on phonics games swear by. Learning is stimulating and <br/>\nexciting and interesting and engaging. And television can be too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTv-holic isn&#39;t really a good way to approach your son&#39;s relationship with <br/>\ntelevision. It argues that it is addictive from the start. It argues that it <br/>\nis something that he will not be able to take or leave, that it will be the <br/>\nonly motivating thing in his life. And it certainly makes that little box in <br/>\nthe living room, or whatever room, loom large. Television is really an <br/>\namazing window into the world. And if you can trust your son to be able to <br/>\nget what he wants from television than it can shrink back down to a more <br/>\nreasonable size and not make you suffer such constant turmoil.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d recommend reading through <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vilter.us/Television/index.html\">http://vilter.us/Television/index.html</a> , which is linked from Sandra Dodd&#39;s <br/>\ntv page, but I think should be highlighted. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a> has a nice section on <br/>\ntelevision.

If you are there <br/>\nwith him, and watching next to him, and laughing and giggling and blowing on <br/>\nhis belly during the ad breaks, how can television be more than a part of <br/>\nthat world?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;kristina&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:angelhair45@...\">angelhair45@...</a><br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, November 22, 2006 9:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] What do you think of tv?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is my constant turmoil.

We didn&#39;t really allow <br/>\nmovies/tv untill just after his second birthday. I am constantly torn <br/>\non how much is too much. Should I limit how much he watches. Is it <br/>\ntrue that tv stunts learning and creativity?  I was limiting it to <br/>\nonly about 3 hours a week, but I think I created the forbidden fruit <br/>\nby that. Now I&#39;m trying to not limit it, but I&#39;m so worried that I&#39;m <br/>\nletting him watch too much.
