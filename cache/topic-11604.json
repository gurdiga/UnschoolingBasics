He has his bath in the morning, his meals and snacks at about the same time everyday. He knows he will get his yogurt in teh evening before bed. These steady items seem to be enough to confort him and he deals with the &quot;afternoon unknown&quot; fine most days. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My Courtney though is a different story! She is upset if I drive somewhere a different way, if something dosent happen that was supposed to happen, etc. <br/>\n  So I do as much routine as possible without making everyone else crazy. I give her the structured school she wants but its with the understanding that she has to either do it while Nathaniel is at school if she wants me right there with her or do it mainly on her own. <br/>\n  I throw in unexpected changes in the day that are good suprises ( like chuckee cheese or the park) this has helped her realize that changes in the routine arent always a bad thing and go with the flow when there are changes that i cant do anything about. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So anyway In my opinion ......find out what parts he really needs and what parts you could help him do without. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

When we would go to Disney world<br/>\nwe would talk at breakfast about what it was we wanted to accomplish that<br/>\nday.  What rides we wanted to do and what shows we would see, etc.  Keon<br/>\nwould get fixated on what we said.  So when we would go to Animal Kingdom,<br/>\nin his mind, we were supposed to go do It&#39;s Tough to be a Bug, the Safari,<br/>\nKali River Rapids and have lunch.  In that order.  If the line for the<br/>\nsafari was really long we would get Fast Passes (a line skipping program at<br/>\nDisney) and come back when our time was up.  To Keon waiting in line for 45<br/>\nminutes was better than waiting 2 hours, doing something else and skipping<br/>\nline waiting completely.  It fell in order with his universe.  He has gotten<br/>\nmuch better as he has gotten older with the concept that things can change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve worked hard to try to bring spontenaiety into his life.  It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsomething I could spring on him, but something that I eased in so that he<br/>\ncould handle changes in his routine.  He still is very routine oriented<br/>\nthough.  For instance right now he is outside tending to the garden because<br/>\nI made the mistake of telling him once, &quot;Each morning we need to go out and<br/>\nmake sure that the garden is ok and no bugs are eating our plants and fill<br/>\nthe water bucket so it can warm.&quot;  He has to know what we are doing each day<br/>\nand likes to have plenty of warning if things are going to change.<br/>\nYesterday was a sort of difficult day for him as we bombed the house for<br/>\nfleas.  We had to be out for 4 hours.  We decided to go out for lunch and<br/>\nthen go see a movie.  Well, the cheaper theater&#39;s movie had just started<br/>\nwhen we got there so we decided to go to the other theater (note: we didn&#39;t<br/>\nbother to check show times before leaving the house - it was an adventure<br/>\nLOL!)  When we got there the first showing of a movie we wanted to see<br/>\nwasn&#39;t for another hour and some.  So we left and went to go pick up some<br/>\nmedicine for the cats and come back.  It was a lot of changing of minds and<br/>\nactivities, but he ended up not being as panicked as he has in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":181397287,"authorName":"Cara","from":"Cara &lt;tworobin@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Thoughts about limits","postDate":"1145109376","msgId":11983,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMwNjY2NUIwLjZCNjUldHdvcm9iaW5AdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNDUxMDE0NjQuMTI5Ny4zMTgyNy5tMjBAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11980,"nextInTopic":11992,"prevInTime":11982,"nextInTime":11984,"topicId":11604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Maisha: My dds don t have aspergers, but were always asking me what are we going to do today? or What are we going to do tomorrow?

When we started homeschooling (not unschooling at<br/>\nthat point) about a year ago, there were lots of schedules involved.  Slowly<br/>\nwe were able to move away from that, at Drew&#39;s pace.  He&#39;s now at a point<br/>\nwhere he is fairly comfortable not having a strict schedule.  He still needs<br/>\nto know what&#39;s happening for the day in a general way, and for the<br/>\nweek/month (calendars are a favorite in our house!).  But it&#39;s not down to<br/>\nthe minute any longer.  Drew&#39;s stress level has gone done enormously since<br/>\nwe pulled him from school, and even more in the past few weeks as we&#39;re<br/>\nmoving into unschooling.  I personally believe that home is a wonderful<br/>\nplace for ASD kids to learn and be - much less stimulating than school,<br/>\nwhich is a good thing for them!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was talked into believing that he needed a schedule by all the<br/>\nteachers he had in pre-K and K (all special ed classes).  He certainly likes<br/>\nsome structure, but he&#39;s actually quite loose now. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, there is no reason why you can&#39;t have a schedule in your house<br/>\nand still unschool.

I have a child that<br/>\nfalls into the autistic spectrum.  He has a very difficult time identifying<br/>\nhis needs.  He never realizes he is hungry until he is so hungry that food<br/>\nneeds to be delivered to him RIGHT NOW!  He then doesn&#39;t realize when he is<br/>\nfull until he throws up.  He doesn&#39;t recognize when he is tired either.  We<br/>\ntried for a long time (and continue) to explain the signs of these things.<br/>\nFor instance when he is tired we will say, &quot;Your eyes look heavy and you are<br/>\nmoving slowly.  You must be tired.&quot;  or &quot;You&#39;ve eaten 3 pancakes, 4 sices of<br/>\nbacon, 3 eggs, and a piece of toast.  Your stomach must feel very full like<br/>\nit is going to burst!&quot;  He&#39;s the only of my children who still has a<br/>\nbedtime.  (8:05 pm) and the only one that I have to put food limits on.  I<br/>\nwould love for him to get to the point where his sisters are and recognize<br/>\nthat he is tired, hungry, satiated, thirsty, needing to eliminate, etc.  It<br/>\nsaddens me that I do have to continue to monitor what he eats and recognize<br/>\nhis cues for him.  I&#39;m hoping by helping him to recognize these cues and<br/>\nbecome aware of them on his own that I will be able to ease off his<br/>\nlimitations and let him have the freedoms his sisters have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have tried several times to not have these limitations.  The last time we<br/>\ntried this he would fall into a puddle of tears because he didn&#39;t know what<br/>\nhe was feeling or what it meant.  He got angry at us because we weren&#39;t<br/>\nhelping him!  So we continue to help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of his biggest problems is that he is a natural morning person.  The sun<br/>\ncomes up and my son gets up with it, whether he has had 10 hours of sleep or<br/>\n3 hours of sleep.  He&#39;s been this way since he was 3 months old!  (It&#39;s a<br/>\ngood thing his mama is also a morning person.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtime and food were two of the hardest things to let go of with my girls.<br/>\nPartly because I had always had my food controlled for me as a child.  I<br/>\nrealized that if I continued to control food like my parents controlled my<br/>\nfood that they would grow up with the same issues surrounding food that I<br/>\nhave.  I didn&#39;t want that.  I also found that my problem with sleep was that<br/>\nI have one child who is a natural night owl.  Been that way since birth<br/>\n(didn&#39;t even give me a 3 month wait!)  My other child likes to stay up late<br/>\nbut will go to bed when she is tired, usually before midnight.  I just can&#39;t<br/>\nstay up late like that.  I need my sleep and like to do it so I can feel<br/>\nrested when I get up with the sun/son.  I realized that they didn&#39;t need me<br/>\nto stay up with them.  And since then have been at peace about letting them<br/>\nstay up even though I am tired and going to bed.

(Hey, <br/>\nwe&#39;re talking over 40 dog years!)  Too much has happened, and I <br/>\nthink my mind weeded out what was unnecessary, to a certain degree.  <br/>\nMany details are gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I do remember -- this was when my son was 2 1/4.  The <br/>\ncrib.  Oh, boy!  He was doing very unsafe things in it -- things <br/>\nthat had me seriously worried about a cracked skull.  But he loved <br/>\nhis crib, too.  We bought a bed, and put it in the room, while still <br/>\nleaving the crib up, thinking to ease him into the bed, that he <br/>\nwould make the choice to go to the bed, etc.  (A friend&#39;s dd <br/>\ntransitioned so easily that way, so I thought it seemed a good <br/>\nway.)  Well, what happened is that he got to be horribly behaved day-<br/>\nin, day-out.  He didn&#39;t want the bed, it was too big a decision - <br/>\nyet, I know darned well he was NOT safe in his crib at this point.  <br/>\n(He claimed that, even with the bed rail, it needed higher sides.)  <br/>\nThe behavior got to a point, I was practically ready to hand him <br/>\nover to a neighbor for a few months.  (Okay, not really, but it was <br/>\nbad!)  Finally, I realized that it was too much for a 2 yr old to <br/>\ndeal with.  I had to set the limits, the tone -- and we let him know <br/>\nthat after his nap we would take the crib down, he would be sleeping <br/>\nin the big boy bed, etc.  He slept fine in the bed, and his behavior <br/>\ndid a 180 -- I got my child back.  And he was no longer in such <br/>\ndanger.  (Yes, he really was at high risk of falling and hitting his <br/>\nhead on the corner of the dresser, due in part to the design of the <br/>\ncrib.)  I had to be the parent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been even longer since my one nephew was young, but I remember <br/>\nthat his parents, even if they said no, let him do whatever he <br/>\nwanted.

If he goes too long -- and how long <br/>\nthat is can vary -- it effects his mood, etc., and he doesn&#39;t realize <br/>\nthat he needs food.  He gets to a place where he is beyond recognizing <br/>\nit at this point, and there are definite reprecussion.

He would have trouble sleeping if he saw <br/>\nsomething that was too intense, read something too intense.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nso much a limit, really, as just censorship -- I had a handle <br/>\ngenerally on what he couldn&#39;t handle and avoided it.  (And that, too, <br/>\nis something that was long lasting.)  When he was older, he once slept <br/>\nover a friend&#39;s house, and in the morning they watched Scooby-Doo on <br/>\nZombie Island.  To my surprise, that night, he had trouble sleeping <br/>\nbecause of that show!  (He was probably 8 or 9 by then.)  The boy who <br/>\nhe had the sleepover was fine -- and was fine with lots of things my <br/>\nson was not, despite the fact that my son was older.  So, my son&#39;s <br/>\nlimits had to be set at a different place than the other boy&#39;s, <br/>\nbecause they are different kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make any sense, or are my fingers just rambling?  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thoughts about limits","postDate":"1144766545","msgId":11614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFNTlGNTk2LUM2QjMtNEU2RC1CNDJBLUNERjVGNDhEMjFDN0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDExMTQyNTAwLjI1NjgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDExMTQyNTAwLjI1NjgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11611,"nextInTopic":11619,"prevInTime":11613,"nextInTime":11615,"topicId":11604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... depends on what you mean by limits.

I ve been trying","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2058150309\">I&#39;m still working on my views and practices regarding limits in my home.<br/>\nFor me, this always ties into the respect that I give my children.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen trying to compare my reactions to my children with my reactions to my<br/>\nhubby, or a friend.  Would I put food limits on my hubby?  Would I tell my<br/>\nfriend how much TV she could watch?  Certainly not.  I would be trying to<br/>\ncontrol them, and that&#39;s horribly disrespectful.  So why do I feel the need<br/>\nto do these things to my children?  My kids still have some limits on food<br/>\nand electronics, but we&#39;re slowly pulling back day by day.  I find that they<br/>\neat wonderfully when I say &quot;yes&quot; to every food choice.  They are playing a<br/>\nton of electronics, and doing lots of other things too.  Nobody is unsafe,<br/>\nnobody is upset, it&#39;s working quite nicely so far.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOn occaision my older son (who is autistic) will get overly agitated while<br/>\nplaying video games.  Not every time, but sometimes.  I used to say, &quot;Okay,<br/>\nthat&#39;s it, turn off the game, take a break!&quot; and I made the break<br/>\n*mandatory* for him.  THAT was the mistake, as I see it.  He would of course<br/>\nflip out ever more intensly and it was a messy downward spiral from there.<br/>\nThen I stepped back and tried to figure out WHY I was making him take a<br/>\nbreak.  It seemed obvious to ME that he needed one, because he was<br/>\noverstimulated.  But is it my job to make the break happen.OR.is it my job<br/>\nto help HIM understand why he needs a break, so that he can regulate his own<br/>\nreactions to the world around him?  Ah ha!  That last one would extend FAR<br/>\nbeyond video gaming into self-control in all areas of life.  Bingo!  That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat my goal became.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we talk about listening to his body, to his mind.  That when he flips<br/>\nout over (blank), it is his body/mind telling him that a break would be<br/>\nhelpful.  That stepping back and calming down will feel good.  Then I leave<br/>\nhim the choice of what he&#39;d like to do about it (the very hard part for<br/>\nme!).  He&#39;s not 100% on choosing a calming activity, or walking away for a<br/>\nmoment (not even 25% yet!) but the control is back to HIM now.  And let&#39;s<br/>\nface it, I&#39;m not always going to be there to help him control himself,<br/>\nright?  He needs to master that on his own - however many years that takes<br/>\nhim.  I honestly don&#39;t believe that MAKING him take breaks is going to teach<br/>\nhim anything about calming himself.  I think it&#39;s just teaching him that a<br/>\nbigger and more powerful person can make you do something they want you to<br/>\ndo against your will.  Blech.  Leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I look at<br/>\nit objectively like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell & Da Boys <br/>\n<br/>\nDrew, 6.5 and Josh, 2.5<br/>\n<br/>\nLife is like riding a bicycle.

But I have a different take on it, especially for young <br/>\nchildren.  I view them as a safety box, if you will.  Children with <br/>\nfirm limits that are age-appropriate are completely free to explore <br/>\nwithin those boundaries, and feel safe in there.  As they grow, the <br/>\nlimits then expand accordingly.  (And since they are individuals, <br/>\nwhat limits Johnny has might not work for Billy at the same age.)  I <br/>\nhave seen a nephew who I viewed as rather sad, without limits -- <br/>\nbecause, it&#39;s really scary when you know you can go out of control, <br/>\nand no one will set those limits for you.  I think it is part of <br/>\nparenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite things about my mom -- my hero! -- is that she <br/>\nchanged how she interacted with us as we grew and changed.  I use <br/>\nthat as my model.  Limits can be discussed, even negotiated.  My son <br/>\nand I do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI often said I was both stricter than other parents and that my son <br/>\nhad more freedom than other kids.  Sounds contradictory, but it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t seem to be in practice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts on that at this point in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
