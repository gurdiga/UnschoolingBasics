I wish I could remember what mag it was (somewhere in the<br/>\nbusiness section!) but there was an article about how useful video<br/>\ngames are for children that are healing. They mentioned all the<br/>\nmeditative and calming effects for ill children. If it&#39;s good for<br/>\nconvalescing, then it&#39;s just plain good imo!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also saw an article about a long-term study done on a large number<br/>\nof children about television viewing. The only thing they proved was<br/>\nthat tv does NOT cause ADHD (duh) nor does it affect ADD or ADHD kids<br/>\nnegatively, but there was a correlation with more tv viewing and<br/>\nhigher test scores. Go figure. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16376,"nextTopicId":16409}}
