They would rather see how something works, than <br/>\nread about it on the computer.  Remember, my son came to me, and <br/>\nasked me if I new how to clean a penny.  Unschooling is learning <br/>\nthrough life experiences, and to us this was one.  Everyone is <br/>\nentitled to their own opinions, and thoughts, but who am I to tell <br/>\nmy son to go look it up on the computer, instead of brainstorming <br/>\nwith him.  We learned how to &quot;clean&quot; the penny together.  I have <br/>\ngotten some really good ideas on how to clean one, and once I have <br/>\nthe stuff, I think we will try those too.  So thanks for all the <br/>\nextra information.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not angry at anyone, I just wanted to explain why we chose to <br/>\nexperiment, instead of read about it.
