I&#39;d actually been on the Non-violent communication list for <br/>\nawhile, but I just could not take how you have to &#39;talk&#39; on that list, sounded so <br/>\nstructured and artificial to me...drove me nuts!I  But I do like the message <br/>\nand see how totally it blends with the unschooling/noncoersive philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nn a message dated 6/25/2004 12:12:51 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nThis and Inbal & Marshall&#39;s other writing has helped me work on shifting my<br/>\nrole more and more to one I like a better, one where I make requests rather<br/>\nthan demands, where I remain engaged and connected to my children, giving<br/>\nthem my thoughts, opinions, feelings and guidance but trusting in them to<br/>\nmake their own decisions.
