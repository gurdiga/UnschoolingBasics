The older 2 I had","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-443788705\">I had meant to reply to your post about breastfeeding but had not gotten a chance.<br/>\nGreat job mama for nursing for so long. I have 4 kids. The older 2 I had when I was young and did not have the knowledge of attatchment parenting, extended breastfeeding etc so I weaned them young. My 3rd child nursed for 6 months, I would have wanted to nurse longer but with me working full time and going to school full time I was having so many issues trying to pump and kept getting clogged ducts and mastitis and ended up stopping<br/>\nMy 4th child, Sterling, nursed until he was 5 years and 3 months. He is 5 1/2 now. He would nurse a lot and sometimes it would get frustrating. There were times I wanted him to wean. Like you, I also wanted to follow child led weaning and did not want to force him to wean but at times I would hope he would one day just stop.<br/>\nFinally I just encouraged him to nurse less. I would tell him that it was hurting me, because it was. His latch got more and more painul as time went by. Not sure why, maybe all his teeth or something. I would ask him if he was even getting any milk or if he just liked to nurse. Also I started nursing him in the bedroom so he could not watch tv, listen to the other kids playing etc.  This seemed to cut back his nursing because he did not want to have to go into the other room. The last 3-4 months of nursing I would only nurse him at nap time.<br/>\nHe finally one day just did not want to nurse. After a few days I did ask him if he wanted to nurse ( only because I had so little milk by that point I was worried that I would dry up very fast if he did not nurse for a few days so I wanted to make sure this would be a permanent weaning) He said no. He said he did not need it anymore but that I could hold him lol. After that there was no looking back...his 19 year old sister who moved out, came home for the weekend and she asked Sterling if he still nursed and he was so matter of fact about it. He said No, that is for babies, I do not need that anymore..lol..<br/>\nHe is my last child, I can not have anymore babies, even though I would love to, so I was a bit sad that our nursing relationship was over but I am still very proud for nursing so long and for the bond that we shared. To celebrate I went and bought myself some new sexy bras.<br/>\nI have never nursed 2 kids at once and I am sure that is a huge undertaking and takes a lot of work.<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 03, 2007 1:00 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] All this nursing help!
