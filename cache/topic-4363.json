There is just no emotion to a certain type of food except we like most <br/>\nof it.  When I ask if they want anything at the store it might be artichokes or <br/>\nsour cream dip but very rarely is it anything sweet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis summer when my stepdaughter was with us, she ate so many M&M&#39;s cookies <br/>\nthat she got sick and threw up.  Not just once but on two different occasions.  <br/>\nWhen I talked with her about it, she said she was afraid the other kids were <br/>\ngoing to eat them all.  I told her we&#39;d just buy more.  By the time she went <br/>\nhome, I think she was starting to get the idea that all kinds of  food would be <br/>\navailable to her while she was at our house.   No need to binge or hoard.  <br/>\nSince food is not an issue in our family it seems we  make healthy choices most <br/>\nof the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot only are our food choices healthier but since I have stopped controlling <br/>\nsleep and chores and T.V. watching and video games our family is healthier and <br/>\nhappier .
