Have you asked *her* why she wants to do schooly stuff?<br/>\nIt may be that she thinks she has to because that is what she sees &quot;the<br/>\nnorm&quot; doing.  Home (especially Un) schooling looks very different from<br/>\n&quot;school.&quot;  I think it is perfectly fine to point out that we are always<br/>\nlearning - include yourself and your dh in this as well.  All of you are<br/>\nlearning every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may also be that for your daughter &quot;school stuff&quot; is important.  Perhaps<br/>\nshe likes the schedule of it or the completeness of it.  Until she can relax<br/>\ninto enjoying life she may need to have those things at her disposal.  Ask<br/>\nher what she wants to learn and take as much interest in her desire to do<br/>\n&quot;schooly things&quot; as you would anything else she wants to do.  We are the<br/>\nfacilitators of our children&#39;s dreams.  I don&#39;t think you were attending our<br/>\nlocal group 2  years ago.  We had a child who would bring &quot;schooly work&quot; to<br/>\nresource day.  Her mother didn&#39;t make her do it, but she *wanted* to do it.<br/>\nShe enjoyed it.  She decided to go to school this year.  Guess what?  She<br/>\nhated it.  It wasn&#39;t structured enough, wasn&#39;t disciplined enough, and the<br/>\nsocial structure was not what she was expecting, so she is planning on<br/>\nreturning home next year.   She thrives on completion and order.  She learns<br/>\nwell in that environment and school was not that environment.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, Emily went through a period about a year ago where she wanted to &quot;do<br/>\nsomething&quot;  Something meaning &quot;school work.&quot;  She felt like I was neglecting<br/>\ntheir education with all this &quot;unschooling stuff.&quot;  I gave her a copy of<br/>\n&quot;How Children Learn&quot; (or whatever that title is) and let her read it.  We<br/>\nalso talked about unschooling and what it meant to live and learn.  For her<br/>\nI showed her examples of how she and her siblings had learned things over<br/>\nthe past year.  Now she gets it.  Now she loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"aplan4life","from":"&quot;aplan4life&quot; &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: DD says she wants to do &#39;school&#39;....","postDate":"1146661041","msgId":12754,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzYTliaCtqMW43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDODNDQzYyQUEwQjAyMC0xQzc0LTVGOEBtYmxrLXIzNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12752,"nextInTopic":12755,"prevInTime":12753,"nextInTime":12755,"topicId":12747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Kelly!

I&#39;m so glad that I didn&#39;t say anything and just sat our<br/>\nschooly things out and then came here for advice this morning.  The<br/>\nlast thing I want to do is ruin this beautiful unschooling life that<br/>\nwe have going right now but in the back of a minute portion of my<br/>\nbrain, I KNOW that I could easily start thinking...&quot;Well, she wants to<br/>\n&#39;do&#39; school, we&#39;re going to do it.  She is the one who asked for it so<br/>\n&#39;I&#39;m&#39;( I&#39;d bold if I could) goint to tell her when we&#39;re starting and<br/>\nnot let off this track!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nZak has been doing a Pre-GED course, he&#39;s 11 and he&#39;s tired of me<br/>\ntelling him that he doesn&#39;t need it.  My heart is in the right place I<br/>\njust want to make sure that he knows it isn&#39;t a requirement.  He has<br/>\nin his mind that by next August, his 12th birthday, that he wants to<br/>\ntake the GED.  Every night he sits down and does one or two pages and<br/>\nputs the book up on the shelf, taking it inch by inch because it is a<br/>\nHUGE book that one could easily be overwhelmed with.  However, I&#39;ve<br/>\njust found out that here in FL you have to be at least 18 to take that<br/>\ntest and age waivers are for those 16-17 years of age...should I say<br/>\nanything?  He seems to be enjoying this and has set a goal...now I<br/>\n&#39;think&#39; that if really wants to do something like this he&#39;d be better<br/>\nwith College Test Placement studies as those do not &#39;age<br/>\nrestrictions&#39;.  Really, I&#39;m at a loss here as I think DH would be<br/>\ntotally pissed if I said something to ruin a goal that Zak has by<br/>\nspoiling it but now there is the honesty issue to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: aplan4life &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    So I get out all of our &#39;schooly&#39; type things and set them on the<br/>\n&gt; table yesterady a.m.....we did nothing!
