Schools seem to be so anti family these days and, as we all know, <br/>\nit&#39;s the parents job to show kids by example what good, healthy relationships <br/>\nlook like and also to *educate* (so to speak&lt;g&gt;) our kids on what dangers <br/>\nthere are out there. At 11 & 12 our dd&#39;s know what sex is and what rape is.....to <br/>\na degree. The 12 yo knows a bit more. When the subject comes up from a TV <br/>\nshow, the newspaper, etc., they ask questions and we discuss things with them <br/>\ngradually.
