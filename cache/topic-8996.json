I remember when Kyle was in soccer, the parents would yell at us on the sidelines to get our kid to focus and help them win.  I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s here to have fun and be active.  We actually pulled him out of t-ball because the other parents would yell at him and he didn&#39;t like to play anymore.  I guess we just aren&#39;t competitive people.  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184851440,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;poey@...&gt;","profile":"raggedymommyof2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Do you have a problem with competitive sports?","postDate":"1137119616","msgId":8996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmMwMWM2MTdlOSRjMWYxYjVhMCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDhDN0U2MjYxNDY1OEM4Ny0xNDQwLTM3MjhARldNLUQwMS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8998,"prevInTime":8995,"nextInTime":8997,"topicId":8996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to have my children in a sports/athletic program because they enjoy playing soccer and doing gymnastics, but all the programs we have found/been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1831189550\">I would like to have my children in a sports/athletic program because they enjoy playing soccer and doing gymnastics, but all the programs we have found/been in are really competitive to the point the whole class/practice/whatever is all about winning.  The only way I can have them in a gymnastics class that isn&#39;t about preparing for competitions (which we aren&#39;t interested in) is if they are in the toddler class, which they are both too old for.  I&#39;m hoping when we move I can find a gymnastics class that is more activity/fun oriented instead of perfection for competition oriented, but does anyone else have this problem?  When I tried to talk to the teacher about it, she said after 4 they train for competitions, no other choice.  I told her we didn&#39;t want to compete (my kids love to do the tumbling and bars and everything, but when you get into the regimented one person at a time, do it over and over till it&#39;s perfect or sit out for punishment thing, they get frustrated and lose interest).  The same with soccer, my son loved it when he was in a &quot;beginner&quot; team in Colorado which was mostly about fun (some structure, but they were good about letting the kids play and be active and not sit and wait).  But then when he played here, they would have a lot of sit and wait and my son would get bored and lose his focus.  I think team sports are pretty much out until he is ready to participate in that way, but something one on one like gymnastics would really suit him and he LOVED it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s frustrating sometimes to live in such a competitive world!!  Why can&#39;t they just learn technique in a fun environment?  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9145,"nextTopicId":9150}}
