At Halloween I had to buy candy  <br/>\nthe day of or I&#39;d eat them one after another. In fact one year I went  <br/>\nthrough 3 bags of candy the week before Halloween. I knew I couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nbe trusted with candy. I&#39;d proved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I actually knew was how I behaved under restrictions.  <br/>\nSomeone somewhere talked about giving yourself permission to have  <br/>\nwhatever you crave. Give yourself permission to go buy more when it&#39;s  <br/>\nrunning low. Don&#39;t create a scarcity. It made no sense! I *knew* I&#39;d  <br/>\njust eat and eat and eat and grow to 300 lbs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I tried it. It took me 3 bags of almond M&Ms and several days of  <br/>\nfeeling yucky but I did eventually get my fill. Now I can eat just a  <br/>\nfew at a time.  It used to be I&#39;d eat an entire row of Oreos only  <br/>\nstopping because I felt yucky and then swore I&#39;d never have another  <br/>\nOreo -- which lasted until I stopped feeling yucky and would have  <br/>\nseveral more. But because I gave myself permission to have as much as  <br/>\nI wanted, we now have a never empty bowl of Dove milk chocolates  <br/>\n(which I think are heavenly). I have maybe 3 a week. I can keep a bag  <br/>\nof Oreos in the house *and they get stale.*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd funny thing is that my weight is still what it was when I was  <br/>\nrestricting certain foods from my diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeprivation makes for desperation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your child&#39;s case it could also be novelty. Anything new is bound  <br/>\nto be eaten in greater quantities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could also be convenience. One of the great attractions of so- <br/>\ncalled junk foods is that they&#39;re easy to grab and eat. Lots of  <br/>\npeople on the list have great ideas for easy, healthful snacks that  <br/>\nare just as easy to grab. It&#39;s helpful to keep the &quot;junk&quot;/convenience  <br/>\nfood up above eye level so it&#39;s eaten when a child specifically wants  <br/>\nthat rather than because it&#39;s easy to grab. It&#39;s helpful not to buy  <br/>\nconvenience foods that aren&#39;t specifically requested.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be he&#39;s gearing up for a growth spurt and instinctively  <br/>\nknows he needs high calorie foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one &quot;just&quot; does anything. There are reasons behind what kids do.  <br/>\nAnd we can help them get what they want.
