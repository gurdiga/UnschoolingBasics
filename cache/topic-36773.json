Ultra-convenient and beautifully presented?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you doing to help him sleep? Do you dim the lights? Put on gentle, soothing music?

Others have mentioned &quot;monkey platters.&quot; That gives him a choice. Remember that most children LOVE to &quot;dip&quot;---hummus, ranch dressing, salsa, caramel sauce, melted chocolate, cheese sauce, salad dressing, cream cheese spread. Toothpicks are a mom&#39;s best friend: cut up *everything* and stick a toothpick in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith sleep, are you just leaving things alone until the child collapses?
