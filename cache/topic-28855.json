So far, all of our stuff is in buckets or a toy box and most of it is inaccesable. I thought I had found some furniture that would work for stacking and storing things. My husband told me not to buy it because he can build it (haha!). I like the idea of clear plastic tubs stacked on shoe racks or some other cubby type stand. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Where do you keep the storage units? We have a playroom upstairs that is packed full of toys strewn everywhere as well as the TV and computer. Downstairs I set up the formal dining room to be a play/activity room. That&#39;s where I imagined we&#39;d do our artsy/craftsy stuff, (no carpet so easier clean up), building (room to leave stuff set up indefinitely), etc. So, that would be where I&#39;d put the cubby units. The problem is that we are hardly ever down there right now. Life is just not conducive to hanging out in that room right now. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Do you all have one room dedicated to your stuff or do you put things in different rooms depending on their use?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1465368127\">I am hoping someone out there has the magical answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to figure out a way to store all of my girls toys so they<br/>\ncan have easier access to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago I bought shoe organizers. They had two shelves and<br/>\ncould be stacked. I took the second shelf and moved it so that I<br/>\nbasically had a long rectangle. I stacked these 3 high so I had 3<br/>\nshelves and the top to put stuff on. I took everything out of their<br/>\nboxes and stored each item in a small plastic rectangular tub and then<br/>\nput them on the shelf. My kids could go grab a tub and bring it to the<br/>\ntable, sit on the floor whatever. When they were done they could just<br/>\nthrow it all back into the tub which made it a lot easier and faster<br/>\non them. Well I didn&#39;t keep the shelves because they weren&#39;t that<br/>\nsturdy and now I&#39;m regretting it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of our games, toys, etc are stored in plastic bags to save space<br/>\nso stacking them on a bookshelf wouldn&#39;t be an option. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t want to use really tall bookshelves since I have younger<br/>\nones (7 and 4) and want them to be able to reach it all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI welcome any ideas or insight as to what you do. Thank you in advance. <br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28850,"nextTopicId":28891}}
