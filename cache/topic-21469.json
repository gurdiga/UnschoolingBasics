Please know that we carefully<br/>\nconsider all comments and concerns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reviewing the segments and the online components you brought to our<br/>\nattention featuring the home-schooled character Tobey, we are revising the<br/>\nWord Girl website.  Tobey will no longer be identified as a home-schooled<br/>\nstudent.  We understand your concern that other home-schooled students might<br/>\nfeel stereotyped by the character, and we regret if your or your child<br/>\nperceived that Tobey represents all home-schoolers.  That was never the<br/>\nintention of the writers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for contacting us and sharing your concerns. It is very important<br/>\nto us that any series we support positively contributes to the development<br/>\nof young viewers, and we are always very glad to hear from the teachers,<br/>\nparents and children who read our books, use our products and watch our<br/>\nprograms. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to contact me directly with any other questions or<br/>\nconcerns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica Wollman, M.Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\nExecutive Director<br/>\n<br/>\nProgramming & Development<br/>\n<br/>\nScholastic Media<br/>\n<br/>\n578 Broadway, 11th floor<br/>\n<br/>\nNew York, NY 10012-3999<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21386,"nextTopicId":21474}}
