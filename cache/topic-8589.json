I am in Alabama and have centipede grass in the lawn area of my yard.  If I planted vegies in my yard and then decided one year was enough, or that I wated to put the vegies somewhere else, I would just smooth out the ground and the centipede would move back in--especially if I left rows of grass between rows of vegies.  But I don&#39;t know what grass does in your area.  Another suggestion is to make a raised bed and edge it with something to make the area more formal looking.   Instead of tilling up my back yard for vegies, I created a more formal area that mimics a Williamsburg kitchen garden.  I wanted to just plow up a part of my backyard, but DH thought that would be too messy looking.  The garden is edged in brick, and it has been difficult to maintain, but it does look nice when i can maintain the edgeing.  I have started buring that heavy plastic edging stuff along the outside edge of the bricks to keep the grass from growing between the bricks.  <br/>\n    And check out Square Foot Gardening and Weedless Gardening.  Those books have been helpful to me.  <br/>\nDeirdre<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    Date: Thu, 29 Dec 2005 02:36:58 -0000<br/>\n&gt;    From: &quot;simplemom3&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sja3k@...\">sja3k@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: RE:  OT?

First, consider planting the<br/>\nway native people have done for hundreds of years--the three sisters.<br/>\nGoogle it, you&#39;ll find lots. Any kind of interplanting/ succession<br/>\nplanting like that will save tons of space and be beneficial for your<br/>\nplants as well. Tomatoes and basil make good interplanting, along with a<br/>\nfew marigolds thrown in for color and as a natural pest repellant.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of composting, consider vermiposting--composting with red worms.<br/>\nThey will do the same job in a much smaller space and a much faster time<br/>\nframe.  Again, google it, and you&#39;ll find tons of info.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those interested, we&#39;re about to embark on a vermiposting experiment<br/>\nwith our domestic pet poop. We have a rather complex *g* recycling<br/>\nsystem set up, but right now we have nothing good to do with our dog and<br/>\ncat poop, which shouldn&#39;t be incorporated in the compost like chicken<br/>\npoop, etc. I&#39;ve been reading about vermiposting, and we&#39;re going to give<br/>\nit a shot with the cat/ dog doo. The castings and tea from this can be<br/>\nused on houseplants and other purely ornamental plants--no edibles!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy is another avid gardener who may be along with some good tips.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (6), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With our thoughts, we make the world.&quot; ~~Buddha</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95897089,"authorName":"simplemom3","from":"&quot;simplemom3&quot; &lt;sja3k@...&gt;","profile":"simplemom3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE:  OT?
