We were at Dunkin Donuts drive-through  <br/>\nthe other day, oh, about 10 or 11 am. The car in front of us had 2 women and a <br/>\n girl, I&#39;d say she was about 9 or 10. The car was an old beat up thing. DH <br/>\nsaid,  &quot;I wonder why she&#39;s not in school?&quot; And I LOVE challenging him, it&#39;s like <br/>\na game  we play, so I came back with, &quot;Maybe she&#39;s homeschooled?&quot; DH then <br/>\nsays, &quot;They  don&#39;t LOOK like homeschoolers.&quot; And I said, &quot;Oh? What does a <br/>\nhomeschooler look  like? Do I look like a homeschooler?&quot; Mr. Smartie-Pants comes back <br/>\nwith, &quot;You  look beautiful and they don&#39;t look &quot;bright&quot; enough to do the <br/>\nright thing.&quot;<br/>\nI was LOL...

Now, where the kids are concerned, the &quot;technical&quot;  <br/>\nstuff sometimes is over his head. So, sometimes I assume he&#39;s not paying  <br/>\nattention. lol... boy, have I been wrong! Now, I know he&#39;s had his qualms over  <br/>\nthe homeschooling issue, the same typical concerns of the uninformed. And, of  <br/>\ncourse, I&#39;ve always had an answer/solution/suggestion for those concerns. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow, I&#39;ve been VERY VERY lucky in that, I have full support from his mom  and <br/>\nmy parents as well as some extended family members.
