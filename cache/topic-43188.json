I put her in gymnastics and it really helped.  She still does these things but I have seen a decrease in it.  She is more likely to do a few cartwheels as you walk along instead of lie down and roll around.  we also have a mini trampoline and someone is usually jumping on it.  I am trying karate for my 4 year old this week.  He likes to kick and chop people.

I took two large square pieces of fabric, sewed them together keeping one side open for stuffing, stuffed the now sack full of old bedspreads, pillows, anything soft, then stitched up the side. I then used this huge pillow for jumping on and physical contact. One thing I did  was to build an obstacle course that involved climbing a few steps (kitchen step stool) then jumping into the sack before crawling through a tunnel. I would then give my son an addition problem, like 2 + 2. He&#39;d solve the addition problem then run through the obstacle course that many times. He felt very proud of his math, got his wiggles out on a rainy day, and received the proprioceptive input his body needed.
