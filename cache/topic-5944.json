What are the ages of your children? May I suggest that <br/>\nyou<br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t know what they are thinking or learning while they are <br/>\ndoing<br/>\nthese activities since you can&#39;t get &quot;inside their brain&quot;?  I have a 9 <br/>\nyr old I<br/>\ntried to teach to read from age 4.  He hated the whole phonics thing <br/>\nand the<br/>\nBORING memorization of sounds, etc and after *3 years* he was not <br/>\ncatching on to<br/>\nit.  I took him to a teacher for testing 2 years ago and she suggested<br/>\nunschooling since my son had grown to absolutely hate school (I was <br/>\nteaching him<br/>\n&quot;the wrong way&quot; every day by making him sit at a table and memorize all <br/>\nthese<br/>\nsounds and math facts, etc).  Once we started unschooling and he knew <br/>\nhe could<br/>\ndo whatever he wanted he went through a very long 6 month phase of <br/>\ndoing nothing<br/>\nbut watching TV or playing Playstation 2 games.  At that time the only <br/>\ncomputer<br/>\ngames I had for him were the educational math/phonics<br/>\ngames so he wanted nothing to do with the computer either.   It was <br/>\nextremely<br/>\nhard to sit and watch him do this but I had told him that he could do <br/>\nwhatever<br/>\nhe wanted for awhile so I stuck to my word.  He loves to be read to so <br/>\nat<br/>\nbedtime every night we would read him book after book after book.  One <br/>\nday we<br/>\nhelped my brother move into an apartment and as we were setting his <br/>\ncomputer up<br/>\nmy son happened to notice a couple of &quot;cool-looking&quot; games my brother <br/>\nhad and he<br/>\nasked him about them.  My sweet brother said he didn&#39;t like the games <br/>\nbecause he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get very far on them so he told my son he could try his luck <br/>\nwith them.<br/>\nNow at the time my son was 7 and my brother was in his 30&#39;s! lol  <br/>\nAnyway, my son<br/>\ncame home and immediately started playing those games (Civilization - <br/>\nCall to<br/>\nPower, AD 1503, Crusaders were the names of them.)  When I helped him <br/>\nload them<br/>\non the computer and I saw what they were like I thought to myself, oh <br/>\ngreat, you<br/>\nhave to read and he can&#39;t read so he is just going to get frustrated <br/>\nand mad and<br/>\nI am going to have to sit here with him and read everything to him and <br/>\nI really<br/>\nwasn&#39;t looking foward to that because those are not MY type of games I <br/>\nlike to<br/>\nplay.  He enjoyed those games so much and has spent hours on them.  <br/>\nThat was the<br/>\nbreakthrough he needed.  Ever since that day in January &#39;04 my son has <br/>\nmastered<br/>\nthose games (and taught my brother quite a few things!!) and we have <br/>\ngone on to<br/>\nbuy him more games like that.  This has led us to the Runescape game <br/>\nonline<br/>\nwhich he will play for hours at a time some days and a love for <br/>\nanything<br/>\nmedieval.  He has learned to read......pretty much on his own.....don&#39;t <br/>\nask me<br/>\nhow because I can&#39;t explain it, but he has! It is truly amazing!!  We <br/>\nare all<br/>\nblown away at what he can read now and the enjoyment he gets out of <br/>\nreading.  He<br/>\ncan play _any game_ on the computer and he and I love to compete <br/>\nagainst each<br/>\nother.  He saw me playing Monopoly Tycoon one day and he watched me <br/>\nplay for<br/>\nawhile and then he started playing and winning.......in the process he <br/>\nlearned<br/>\nabout money and now his favorite game to play off the computer is <br/>\nMonopoly!  All<br/>\nof these computer games have led to a love for something and he just <br/>\ncan&#39;t get<br/>\nenough of that.....through books, history channel on TV, board games <br/>\n(Stratego,<br/>\nRisk), a Renaissance Festival we took him to, etc.   Another thing we <br/>\ndid since<br/>\nhis love and skill grew for these type of games is to introduce him to <br/>\nthe<br/>\nPlaystation 2 games my husband had (Medal of Honor and another type <br/>\nlike that,<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember the name right off).   I was opposed to these games at <br/>\nfirst<br/>\nbecause of the rating (for violence and language) but my husband showed <br/>\nme how<br/>\nthey are historical.  Of course my son LOVED those games and he and my <br/>\nhusband<br/>\nspent hours on those trying to get through all the challenges and in <br/>\nthe process<br/>\nhe has learned about WW1, WW2, Pearl Harbor, etc.  He can tell you all <br/>\nkinds of<br/>\nthings about the war and has now taken to learning more about why the <br/>\nwars were<br/>\nstarted, etc.<br/>\nI know this is long and if you read it alll the way to the end, thanks <br/>\nfor<br/>\nreading.  My husband was not sold out on unschooling at all and we <br/>\nargued about<br/>\nit off and on for a year.  Finally this past spring I asked my husband <br/>\nto think<br/>\nabout our son&#39;s learning experiences over the last year and I asked him <br/>\nif he<br/>\nthought our son had grown learning wise or if he was still at the same <br/>\nlevel<br/>\nthat he was at this time last year.  When he stopped to realize all the <br/>\nthings<br/>\nds has learned and can do (read!  math facts!! handle money, tell time, <br/>\nfigure<br/>\nout how to look up info on the computer or in a book when he wants to <br/>\nknow more<br/>\nabout something he is interested in) and the biggest thing of all is he <br/>\nis doing<br/>\nthis stuff now because it is his choice and he loves to do it then my <br/>\nhusband<br/>\nbecame completely sold out on this whole way of life and now <br/>\ncontributes to it<br/>\nmore by doing more with our son.<br/>\nElisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

My sweet brother said he didn&#39;t like <br/>\nthe games because he couldn&#39;t get very far on them so he told my son <br/>\nhe could try his luck with them.  Now at the time my son was 7 and <br/>\nmy brother was in his 30&#39;s! lol  Anyway, my son came home and <br/>\nimmediately started playing those games (Civilization - Call to <br/>\nPower, AD 1503, Crusaders were the names of them.)  When I helped <br/>\nhim load them on the computer and I saw what they were like I <br/>\nthought to myself, oh great, you have to read and he can&#39;t read so <br/>\nhe is just going to get frustrated and mad and I am going to have to <br/>\nsit here with him and read everything to him and I really wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlooking foward to that because those are not MY type of games I like <br/>\nto play.  He enjoyed those games so much and has spent hours on <br/>\nthem.  That was the breakthrough he needed.  Ever since that day in <br/>\nJanuary &#39;04 my son has mastered those games (and taught my brother <br/>\nquite a few things!!) and we have gone on to buy him more games like <br/>\nthat.  This has led us to the Runescape game online which he will <br/>\nplay for hours at a time some days and a love for anything <br/>\nmedieval.  He has learned to read......pretty much on his <br/>\nown.....don&#39;t ask me how because I can&#39;t explain it, but he has! It <br/>\nis truly amazing!!  We are all blown away at what he can read now <br/>\nand the enjoyment he gets out of reading.  He can play _any game_ on <br/>\nthe computer and he and I love to compete against each other.  He <br/>\nsaw me playing Monopoly Tycoon one day and he watched me play for <br/>\nawhile and then he started playing and winning.......in the process <br/>\nhe learned about money and now his favorite game to play off the <br/>\ncomputer is Monopoly!  All of these computer games have led to a <br/>\nlove for something and he just can&#39;t get enough of that.....through <br/>\nbooks, history channel on TV, board games (Stratego, Risk), a <br/>\nRenaissance Festival we took him to, etc.   Another thing we did <br/>\nsince his love and skill grew for these type of games is to <br/>\nintroduce him to the Playstation 2 games my husband had (Medal of <br/>\nHonor and another type like that, can&#39;t remember the name right <br/>\noff).   I was opposed to these games at first because of the rating <br/>\n(for violence and language) but my husband showed me how they are <br/>\nhistorical.  Of course my son LOVED those games and he and my <br/>\nhusband spent hours on those trying to get through all the <br/>\nchallenges and in the process he has learned about WW1, WW2, Pearl <br/>\nHarbor, etc.  He can tell you all kinds of things about the war and <br/>\nhas now taken to learning more about why the wars were started, etc.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know this is long and if you read it alll the way to the end, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thanks for reading.

Because im still not<br/>\nconvinced.  Because some just watch tv. End. Then just play video games.<br/>\nPeriod.  No tangents.  No inspired learning.  No pursuits, no follow up.<br/>\nNo questions. No discussions.  And all the cool stuff your kids did only<br/>\nmakes me feel that much more frustrated.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in response to the above post....... how long have you been &quot;unschooling&quot;?  What are the ages of your children? May I suggest that you honestly don&#39;t know what they are thinking or learning while they are doing these activities since you can&#39;t get &quot;inside their brain&quot;?  I have a 9 yr old I tried to teach to read from age 4.  He hated the whole phonics thing and the BORING memorization of sounds, etc and after *3 years* he was not catching on to it.  I took him to a teacher for testing 2 years ago and she suggested unschooling since my son had grown to absolutely hate school (I was teaching him &quot;the wrong way&quot; every day by making him sit at a table and memorize all these sounds and math facts, etc).  Once we started unschooling and he knew he could do whatever he wanted he went through a very long 6 month phase of doing nothing but watching TV or playing Playstation 2 games.  At that time the only computer games I had for him were the educational math/phonics <br/>\ngames so he wanted nothing to do with the computer either.   It was extremely hard to sit and watch him do this but I had told him that he could do whatever he wanted for awhile so I stuck to my word.  He loves to be read to so at bedtime every night we would read him book after book after book.  One day we helped my brother move into an apartment and as we were setting his computer up my son happened to notice a couple of &quot;cool-looking&quot; games my brother had and he asked him about them.  My sweet brother said he didn&#39;t like the games because he couldn&#39;t get very far on them so he told my son he could try his luck with them.
