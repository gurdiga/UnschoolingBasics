So I say in a non-threatening tone &quot;tell me what <br/>\nhappened here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhoa - that is brilliant. That&#39;s it, the &#39;non-threatening tone&#39;.

I have only really got to a place where<br/>\nI can start to have the penny drop with each little detail of these sort<br/>\nof scenarios, so this really helps me think my behaviour through. I have<br/>\na friend who adopts a neutral tone and it even calms ME down. She isn&#39;t a<br/>\npushover, but she is wise enough to know that she is the mediator or the<br/>\nperson with the postiion to help de-escalate things. I am learning SO much<br/>\nfrom this approach. I am quite an exciteable personality, so I can be a bit<br/>\nof a dummy with this kind of thing. After all, charging over with the old<br/>\n&quot;What the @3*! is going on here&quot; is no help at all. I usually apologise for<br/>\njumping the gun and my kids are very forgiving, but I really want to get<br/>\nsome better techniques.

They had a friend over and were making funny videos together<br/>\n- I had asked them to keep it down because it was geting late and my hubby<br/>\nhad gone to bed). A humorous comment or a repeated reminder would have worked<br/>\nfine - they are receptive kids. But I was asking them to be quiet, when my<br/>\nson came to a bit in the movie where he had to make a loud noise - I think<br/>\nthey were being invaded by aliens, or something. I felt totally ignored and<br/>\nwalked out, slamming the door behind me. Yeah, I know....lol. I was thinking<br/>\nabout it after and realised that sometimes a sense of perspective is all<br/>\nthat&#39;s needed - so hard to find in the heat of the moment, but it&#39;s good<br/>\nto have clarity on this kind of thing for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Do as I say...","postDate":"1186520658","msgId":25581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5YW1vaStidWkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlFRkQ0MDMyLTlGMDYtNDI2OS1CMkQwLTNFMDFENzE4NzgzN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":25575,"nextInTopic":25585,"prevInTime":25580,"nextInTime":25582,"topicId":25565,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~However, what I need to hear is suggestions on what I could be doing better, not acceptance for what I did wrong.:) ~~ Same here.

It was panic, but I could have<br/>\nhandled it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got over there and hugged him long and hard and apologized for<br/>\nscaring him. I explained that I was really scared that a kitten was<br/>\nabout to get stepped on, but I shouldn&#39;t have yelled like that. He&#39;s<br/>\nreally sensitive to any kind of loud voice.
