It was SO neat <br/>\nto look at unfamiliar faces and then check out a familiar name on a <br/>\ntag!! Let&#39;s see if I can remember all.. It was just a delight to <br/>\nmeet you, Jann(et) ;), Robin, Laura, Kelly, Ben, Rue, Beth.. sheesh, <br/>\nI know I&#39;m forgetting someone.. sorry if I have!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Ben, and the SSUDS group. It was EXACTLY what both my <br/>\nhusband and I needed to really jump in with both feet. My children <br/>\nhad a really fun time connecting with open, friendly, bright <br/>\nchildren. It&#39;s not always easy to take my HS Christian places and <br/>\nfor him not to feel threatened in some way .. so I thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to Ren, HA! I floated under the radar but I was there and in <br/>\nyour presence often!! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just picked up a book today _The Unprocessed Child_ by Valerie <br/>\nFitzeneiter. It speaks to RU deeply.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so proud of my children and being at a conference like the one <br/>\nin Peabody just made me cherish them more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, All,<br/>\nTonya<br/>\nProud Mama to<br/>\nChristian 5-30-95 (happy birthday tomorrow XOX)<br/>\nRory 6-9-99 (energy to the nth degree)<br/>\nAlannah 6-18-03 (my curly girl ;) )<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw Jann, thanks for the email and recommendations.
