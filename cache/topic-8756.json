I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-393324084\">&quot;Could one of you adopt us for a while, so I can learn a different way of<br/>\nbeing? : )&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve just been adopted by an entire list of radical unschoolers!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could give you a hug and then invite you down to my art area,<br/>\nwhere stamps are always a mess and paint gets spilled and paper is<br/>\neverywhere and just turn your kids loose while we drink a cuppa hot<br/>\nchai. I&#39;m envisioning all the good energy surrounding such a moment,<br/>\nand  sending it your way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s time to look into the past....try to evaluate what and<br/>\nwhere these control issues stem from.  I certainly have my share of<br/>\ndemons to silence and control issues are one of them.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if you have a spiritual or religous path, but the most<br/>\ngrowth happened in my life as I let go of religion and embraced my own<br/>\nspirituality (like sweet Jaidens sandwich analogy).  Zen has helped me<br/>\na ton....it&#39;s all about letting go of preconceived notions, letting go<br/>\nof preference and being in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always helped me to picture some of the people at this list (and<br/>\nother lists) sitting right next to me, when these moments unfold and I<br/>\n know there is potential to handle it poorly.  I also think about the<br/>\ntalks I do, and the advice I give, and how would these people feel if<br/>\nthey saw me reacting badly to my children. It matters to me that I am<br/>\npresenting an honest picture of my life, and it matters that my<br/>\nchildren have the best parts of me....so picturing being &quot;watched&quot; can<br/>\nhelp in a rough moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you put out some materials, in a place that is safe for<br/>\nexploration and just walk away when you feel the need to control?<br/>\nLetting them be, with cool stuff, is better than squelching their joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, the mind can accept logic quickly, but the<br/>\nemotions...the oh-so-tangled web of our pasts can take longer to catch<br/>\nup with the mind. Frustrating, but true.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the ways you felt out of control as a child, the things<br/>\nthat made you feel a need to be in charge. What happened in life that<br/>\nmade you convinced you had to be in charge or everything would fall apart?<br/>\nI can just about bet there&#39;s a little girl inside that ugly control,<br/>\nthat is scared and just trying to hold her world together.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I found out about myself...it was a relief and a shock<br/>\nwhen that realization hit me. I NEEDED to be in control or my world<br/>\nwas going to go down the drain. I was afraid at the innermost core of<br/>\nmy being....I&#39;ve learned to roll with the punches a lot better these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to imagine the very worst possible outcome if you let go of<br/>\ncontrol, then ask yourself if the very worst outcome happens, is it<br/>\nreally that bad? If they get all the stamps ruined, if there are<br/>\nstains, if you have mixed ink and mess everywhere but they had fun,<br/>\nwas it worth the money? <br/>\nYES, of course it is.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you never wash the stamps and they stay dirty, it&#39;s OK.
