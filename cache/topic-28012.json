We joke with eachother a lot on this topic.  I wonder how he doesn&#39;t seem to find as much enjoyment in reality as I do and he wonders how I could possibly not LOVE fantasy.  Neither of us can explain it, but we are just complete opposites when it comes to this!  As much as I can&#39;t understand him in that aspect, it is what draws me to him and as much as he can&#39;t understand me, he is drawn to my grasp on reality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do Santa here and most of it is majorly *played* up by him.  We started a tradition with our little ones a couple of years ago where we make an elf door every Christmas Eve and have an elf party where we eat everything miniature, eat from miniature plates, drink from miniature cups, and eat at a little table.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little we did Santa and at a certain age (I think around age 8) my mom told us that it was our turn to create the Santa experience for our younger siblings.  For three years my brother and I got to be Santa for our little sister.  We had so much fun and it lightened the blow that Santa was not *real*.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Kidgie@...&quot; &lt;Kidgie@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, November 27, 2007 3:17:40 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] santa claus?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 11/27/2007 10:45:17 A.M.

I live in a world devoid of magic but full of wonder. Today we went to a museum filled with the most amazing sculptures and carvings and paintings, the Francis Bacon pieces disturbed us all. But as we wandered about looking at these beautiful creations we found a sculpture of Venus who glittered and shone, and as we drew near we discovered that she was covered in the fine filiments of webs spun by hundreds of spiders who found her bumpy surface the best possible surface for catching the bugs for which they hungered. It was wonderful, but it wasn&#39;t the act of a fairy or a magical creature, it was spiders&#39; works that fascinated us. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\nDears<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not disturbed by your seeming realistic views.

I believe in Santa and the fairies of the universe and every other part of fantasy.

I was very embarrassed by the whole thing and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want my kids to have to have that happen (I decided that long before<br/>\nwe homeschooled, let alone unschooled).  But given  my experience, I also<br/>\ndidn&#39;t  want my kids to be the one to traumatize some poor kid.  We love<br/>\npretend and make believe and Santa was just one of many make believe<br/>\ncharacters as my kids grew up. Right up there with Mickey Mouse, Big Bird,<br/>\ntheir imaginary friend....but we never had presents from Santa.  (I love<br/>\npicking out special presents for my kids and wanted to get the credit!)<br/>\nChristmas was and still is a very magical special time at our house, with or<br/>\nwithout Santa.  My first three kids were pretty good about not spoiling the<br/>\nmagic for other kids. They never had a problem going along with the whold<br/>\nSanta thing. We talked about different families having different traditions<br/>\nand how special it was for them...but my 4th child never wanted anything to<br/>\ndo with Santa (big strange man in a very strange suit...no way!). And he<br/>\ntends to be very honest, so a little white lie to spare the feelings of<br/>\nanother child just didn&#39;t work for him. So we taught him the child&#39;s version<br/>\nof &quot;pass the bean dip&quot;.  We role played conversations and ways to answer<br/>\nthem. If he was asked directly &quot;do you believe in Santa?&quot;  He would answer<br/>\nsomething along the line of &quot;I can hardly wait for Christmas morning! What<br/>\nare you hoping to get?&quot; Or something along that line, basically, teaching<br/>\nhim to redirect the question back to the other child with a different<br/>\nconversation. For kids young enough to believe in Santa, it was pretty<br/>\neffective. It was tricky for a couple of years because we have baby sat a<br/>\ngirl since she was 5 and she believed in Santa and her Mom did the Santa<br/>\nthing big at their house. We managed to get through those years without<br/>\nspoiling it for her (now that she&#39;s almost 11 she doesn&#39;t believe any more).<br/>\nIt was tricky sometimes though. I don&#39;t have agree with other parents and<br/>\nthe Santa thing, but I can certainly respect their right to do that and not<br/>\nimpose our way on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-21, (out on her own now), Lisa-18, Willis-17, Karl-16, & Ben-12.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 25, 2007 11:00 PM, Sharissa13 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sharissa13@...\">sharissa13@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   What are people&#39;s opinions of telling kids that Santa<br/>\n&gt; Claus is real?

Your children are hurting other people&#39;s relationship with Santa Claus, with the holidays, with their parents. I can remember when kids at school told me there wasn&#39;t a Santa Claus. IIt was a boy who we used to carpool with to school. I can picture his face, I can remember hating him so much for those words. It was mean and hurtful. It made me feel bad and it made me question things I wasn&#39;t ready to question. Maybe you should take the time to talk to your children about being sensitive to other children&#39;s understanding of the world. I can understand if they are answering when another child asks if they believe in Santa Claus, but to just tell them that their parents are lying, to be so unprepared to bend to another&#39;s needs, I would be disturbed by that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always told my kids the truth about santa claus.

We never did with my kids, and now my<br/>\nyoungest is coming into contact with other children<br/>\nwho think that Santa Claus is real. I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nexplain to my 6 year old about a fictional character,<br/>\nbut all these other kids keep insisting he&#39;s real.<br/>\n=================================<br/>\n <br/>\nI told Simon and Linnaea this year that we acted as Santa Claus. I&#39;d done all of the magical gifters, like the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy and it had always weighed on me. I don&#39;t know why, really. I had loved all of those creatures as a child and had not felt sad or deceived upon discovering the truth, but there was something in my being the deceiver that bothered me. Neither were bothered. I was worried that Linnaea would be distraught, but she made her own peace, she said that David and I were so good to her that she didn&#39;t feel a need for Santa Claus. She said that she imagined there were other children who needed Santa to be generous to them. She still believes there is a Santa Claus, but he is a bringer of joy and not goods. <br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\nIt bugs me because now what I can&#39;t afford to buy my<br/>\nson for Christmas, he thinks Santa is going to bring<br/>\nhim. We already struggle with materialism with him...<br/>\nthis isn&#39;t making things any easier. And what do I do?<br/>\nTell these other kids that their parents are liars and<br/>\nSanta Claus isn&#39;t real? What the heck do I tell my son?<br/>\n====================<br/>\n <br/>\nI would worry less about what you tell your son and more about your concern with materialism. Humans are materialistic. Just are. In 1626 Peter Minuit managed to buy Manhattan from some Native Americans for beads and trinkets worth about $28. People like stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is that on the run up to this Christmas Simon and Linnaea can&#39;t really think of much stuff that they want. They&#39;ll enjoy the getting of things, but they really don&#39;t feel needy enough to hope for the piles and piles of stuff that never really make you happy, but you really hook your hopes and dreams onto, or at least I did for a long, long time. They get what they want mostly when they want it. If we can&#39;t afford it in that moment, we think and strive and save or look for things that we can trade in or sell to make it work. I can&#39;t remember a time when as a child I went to the store with my mom and she offered to get me something and I turned it down. My daughter, who has a love of clothes that makes me smile, will walk away from an outfit that she doesn&#39;t think works as well as another outfit. And it isn&#39;t because she isn&#39;t materialistic, it&#39;s because she isn&#39;t needy. I was needy. I equated love with stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would listen to my son about the things he hopes Santa will bring in the face of your own lack of funds. I would write them down and spend time looking at ways to make those gifts possible. I would spend time scouring ebay for used goods or Craigs Lists or asking relatives if they could help out with these wishes. If you aren&#39;t going to give a magical giver you need to be that giver. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to direct your son&#39;s responses to his believing friends, just tell him to be sensitive to their faith. I have talked to Simon and Linnaea about those people who believe and how they need to let them revel in their own relationship with Santa Claus. As an atheist who often finds herself amidst theists I know it can be hard, but it helps more to be kind and supportive of someone else&#39;s magical world than to crash it down with stories of parents as liars. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: santa claus?","postDate":"1196098843","msgId":28025,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0YS4xOTE3ODdmMS4zNDdjNWYxYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28024,"nextInTopic":28026,"prevInTime":28024,"nextInTime":28026,"topicId":28012,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/26/2007 9:17:36 A.M.

We&#39;ve had everything from aliens to<br/>\ntransporter beams to &quot;tooth seeds&quot; (the tooth is a seed with a prize<br/>\ninside that pops open when it gets put under the pillow). Just the other<br/>\nday, he said he really doesn&#39;t think there&#39;s a Santa Claus - there must<br/>\nbe some sort of transporter beam that beams the presents under the tree.<br/>\nOkay, we&#39;ll go with that for now - it&#39;ll probably be something else next<br/>\nyear.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and DS *knows* that his wishlist is a WISH list - not everything on<br/>\nit is something he&#39;ll get for Christmas. BUT he also knows that<br/>\nChristmas (and birthdays) are not the only times he can get stuff.<br/>\nWhenever he sees something cool that fits the budget, it&#39;s his. He looks<br/>\nat prices and even HE thinks that some things are too expensive and<br/>\nhe&#39;ll just wait until the price comes down a bit first. It&#39;s all tied<br/>\nup, I think, with an overall sense of abundance, a sense that his wants<br/>\nare taken seriously and given equal priority with everything else. If<br/>\nit&#39;s doable, we do it. If it&#39;s the middle of February and we see<br/>\nsomething he didn&#39;t get that he still wants and NOW we&#39;ve got the funds,<br/>\nhe gets it. So, there&#39;s no sense of desperation involved with Christmas<br/>\n(or birthdays). If he doesn&#39;t get something on that one day, there are<br/>\nlots of other days and other ways to get it.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Other kids don¹t have to believe the same<br/>\nstory. In our house we celebrate the stories of the season ­ all of them<br/>\nthat we possibly can. Celebrate St. Nikolas day Dec 6 and tell the stories<br/>\nabout him (no I am not religious in any way). Talk about the history of<br/>\nSanta Claus. Learn about how other places around the world celebrate the<br/>\nstories of Santa Claus or whatever he is called there. Work with him to<br/>\nchoose a family or child to give presents to ­ let him be Santa Claus. Maybe<br/>\nhe will see how lots of kids around him think the stories are so fabulous<br/>\nthat they want to believe they are real.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nZoa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/25/07 11:00 PM, &quot;Sharissa13&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sharissa13@...\">sharissa13@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are people&#39;s opinions of telling kids that Santa<br/>\n&gt; Claus is real?
