My <br/>\nhusband is in the Air Force, and he is a very analytical <br/>\nfreethinker.  He was in college for a few years and couldn&#39;t decide <br/>\non a path, so he decided on the military.  There have been times <br/>\nwhen he questioned that decision, but there are certain things he <br/>\nenjoys about his job as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad was also in the Air Force.  He joined to get away from a too <br/>\ncontrolling mother who had his whole life planned out for him, but <br/>\nhe ended up enjoying it.  Many people join up to get scholarships <br/>\nfor college or for travel opportunities.  I know that we have been a <br/>\nlot of places that we never would have seen otherwise.  Also, there <br/>\nare certainly jobs that are unique to the military.  Dh has a high <br/>\nsecurity clearance and has access to top secret information.  He has <br/>\nalways been interested in history and warfare, and he really enjoys <br/>\nthis part of his job.  For some people, a job like this makes the <br/>\ncontrolling aspects of the military life tolerable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDh is very realistic about it.  He doesn&#39;t agree with a lot of <br/>\nthings that are happening in the world involving the military, and <br/>\nhe has no gung ho illusions about fighting and dying for his <br/>\ncountry.  He chose the Air Force because he thought there would be <br/>\nmore interesting jobs and not as much chance of being in harm&#39;s way <br/>\nas there might have been in another branch of the service.  But he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to cut his hair either - LOL!

He lives with my mom and stepdad and they are VERY against homeschooling, I don&#39;t even bother with trying to explain what we do anymore. My mom works in the public school system, she said so that she could spend time with my little bro, but she&#39;s so tired after work that she goes to her room and he&#39;s left to himself. He is soooo smart, he&#39;s really into computers and web design. He has won some award(or something I&#39;m not sure, my mom didn&#39;t know what it was) on Neopets for things he&#39;s done. He is learning the guitar and drums. He takes amazing photos and has won photo compitions he&#39;s entered. His dad is a jock and harps on him constantly about being on the computer and not playing sports. (He-stepdad- is a photographer and musician also but criticizes what his son does more than incouraging him.) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve noticed that Miles(LB) has started to pull away from his dad, and our mom-more dad than mom- but I can see it comeing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I want to reach out to him, but I&#39;m not sure what or how to do it. We used to be VERY close when he was little. I was the first to hold him the day he was born and I took care of him almost every day until Jaiden(ds1) was born then I still cared for him on the weekends. We moved and as he has grown older he&#39;s pulled away from me, and everyone. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I wish I could convince my mom to bring him home, but really, until this year he loved school and always did well. Things are getting harder for him. My mom will not bring him home. She see&#39;s that he is retreating, chalks it up to age, but has asked me to try to talk to him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m sorry if this is OT, but I love my brother and I miss seeing him smile. Any ideas? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanx in advace :)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocketship underpants don&#39;t help.&quot;<br/>\n-Calvin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

I&#39;ve had jobs I stuck with for one certain aspect of it because I enjoyed it, e.g.<br/>\ntravel.  I could only do it for so long before the rest of the job got to me, but I don&#39;t regret<br/>\nthe experience.  So, I guess, my comment was in ignorance.

I know a couple of Marine recruiters and they tend to like  the <br/>\nhomeschoolers from what I have heard.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou might want to contact your local recruiter and see what they will need  <br/>\nfrom him so you can prepare accordingly.  You might be able to find it  online. <br/>\n It might just be a GED or something, depending on the  service.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI would recommend your son eventually look for the standardized test  study <br/>\nguide that the military gives when one first enlists.  The higher the  score, <br/>\nthe more and better choices available for jobs.<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom experience, my advise FWIW would be to get an easy college degree  and <br/>\ngo in as an officer.  Way, way, way, way more money and  perks.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband just called (coincidence!) and he said if your son was  interested <br/>\nin becoming an officer, you could contact a local university and  there <br/>\nshould be some sort of military liason or ROTC person to give you  information.  He <br/>\nwould probably need recommendations in addition to other  records.  Your son <br/>\ncould even get through earlier if he went to community  college for &quot;high <br/>\nschool&quot; and then finishes up a bachelor&#39;s.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut, no, homeschooling shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Homeschooling and the military","postDate":"1133054273","msgId":7964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRtYjFnMStuYmg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7965,"prevInTime":7963,"nextInTime":7965,"topicId":7964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My last post reminded me of a question I have really been wanting to ask.
