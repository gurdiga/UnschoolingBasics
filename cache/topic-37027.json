Four yr olds want a Lot of autonomy - which isn&#39;t <br/>\nquite the same as independence. They want exactly as much <br/>\nindependence as they want, and not one jot more. They want exactly as <br/>\nmuch help and information as they want, and not one bit more. <br/>\nNaturally, another 4yo can be a very grating person at this time! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnything you can do to make the whole household more &quot;kid friendly&quot; <br/>\nwill help reduce the overall stress level. Look around and try to see <br/>\nhow many times a day your kids can&#39;t do or get something they want <br/>\nwithout needing help of some kind - every one of those is a challenge <br/>\nto be overcome. That can get frustrating. So a certain amount of the <br/>\nbickering you&#39;re seeing is &quot;last straws&quot; iykwim. <br/>\n<br/>\n4yos are also just starting to become aware of their environment on a <br/>\nwhole new level, including the people in that environment. They tend <br/>\nto be a bit more interactive than they were at 3 - and you have two <br/>\nof them with the same new level of awareness, new level of <br/>\ninteractiveness, and same Lack of social skills - and not much <br/>\nempathy, besides. They&#39;re still communicating and problem solving at <br/>\na pretty basic level. The more you can do to be right there with <br/>\nthem, down on the floor, in the middle of things, smoothing over the <br/>\nrough spots, the more modelling they&#39;ll have on which to base some <br/>\nskills. Unfortunately, you don&#39;t have the luxury of distracting a <br/>\nyounger child - so your own skills are going to be streeeeeetched as <br/>\nyou figure out what helps your two. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, don&#39;t disregard the possibility that they are <br/>\nokay figuring things out on their own (at least some of the time) <br/>\nsquabbles and all. I&#39;m not saying to let them fight it out, <br/>\nnecessarily. But do be open to the idea that some of those squabbles <br/>\nare how they&#39;re working on their relationship right now - and since <br/>\nthey&#39;re at the same level of development they may be more okay with <br/>\nthat than if they were even a year apart. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191766711,"authorName":"John Ruschmeyer","from":"&quot;John Ruschmeyer&quot; &lt;jruschme@...&gt;","profile":"jruschme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Chemistry","postDate":"1226926353","msgId":37056,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxNWJkOWQ0MDgxMTE3MDQ1Mm83ZTM1OTE0ZXM3ODI3MDM3NDFhNzQ4NzZlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdmcHVpbytoZnNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ5MWVjYTg4LjE0MDQ1YTBhLjcwMWUuZmZmZmYxY2VAbXguZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4JIDxnZnB1aW8raGZzakBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37054,"nextInTopic":37060,"prevInTime":37055,"nextInTime":37057,"topicId":37027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This came up in one of my RSS feeds this morning; Illustrated Guide to Home Chemistry Experiments: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-145202527\">This came up in one of my RSS feeds this morning; Illustrated Guide to Home<br/>\nChemistry Experiments:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=9780596514921\">http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=9780596514921</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Nov 16, 2008 at 3:07 PM, Meredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s a website with both kits *and* individual chemicals - and all<br/>\n&gt; the other gear and hoo-haa you could possibly want!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hometrainingtools.com/catalog/cat_chemistry.html\">http://www.hometrainingtools.com/catalog/cat_chemistry.html</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I love what the book says about<br/>\nrewards vs punishment, too. Rewards say to the child &quot;If you comply, you get<br/>\na reward, but your response is optional.&quot; Punishments REQUIRE compliance,<br/>\nthey are always administered, because the parental response IS NOT OPTIONAL.<br/>\nYou have to perservere! This system takes work, but once in place, you will<br/>\nsee quicker results because the child is respecting your authority and<br/>\nrespecting and internalizing your values. Trust me, this system with a lot<br/>\nof praise for your child when they do the right thing will go a long way in<br/>\ndeveloping their character!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Fido, Roll Over!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Fido Rolls Over&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Good Dog!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Woof!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Fri, Nov 14, 2008 at 9:30 PM, Professional Parenting &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Would it be too forward to recommend my book?
