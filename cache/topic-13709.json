So I pulled out a spoon and let him scoop up a bite (big step for <br/>\nme, esp if any of you remember my first post to UD, and reprimand form <br/>\nSandra =) ).  Tried it, claimed he loved it and that was that.  Didn&#39;t ask <br/>\nfor more.  A few moments ago when sis(7) got home a conversation something <br/>\nlike this followed:<br/>\n<br/>\nds: Hey Rho, know what I had today?  Sugar.  It was gooder than a, <br/>\na...tooter (mostly rhyming with sugar)<br/>\n<br/>\ndd: Of course it was, a tutor is another word for teacher.  Sugar is <br/>\ndefinitely better than a teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nds: I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have tutor, aren&#39;t you, Rho?<br/>\n<br/>\nHee, hee.  It just keeps getting better around here.  Thank you to all the <br/>\nfolks on this and the many other unschooling lists I&#39;m on who give me <br/>\nsomething to think about everytime I log on, and the patience to see that it <br/>\nis better...yeah, I said BETTER.  I can&#39;t wait to meet everyone in ABQ, just <br/>\nbooked the room today, we&#39;re soooooooooooooooooo excited.<br/>\n<br/>\nA<br/>\n<br/>\nTo live is the rarest thing in the world.
