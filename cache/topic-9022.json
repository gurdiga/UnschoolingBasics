He interviews government officials, union <br/>\nleaders, parents  and students and makes suggestions <br/>\nabout how the system can be improved  (w/o, I fear, <br/>\neven honorable mention for the only real solution, <br/>\nending  government involvement in education attendance, <br/>\ncontent, financing, and  regulation).<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; with  <br/>\nJohn Stossel airs Jan. 13 (10 to 11 p.m. ET) on ABC. <br/>\nSee below how to  order a copy or transcript.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the words of E Ray Moore, good friend and  president <br/>\nof Exodus Mandate:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now Stossel and 20/20 are set to  puncture the last <br/>\nmyth of complacent suburban parents who delude themselves  <br/>\nby thinking that, whatever problems there may be elsewhere, <br/>\ntheir  schools are &quot;different.&quot; As Stossel and 20/20 <br/>\npoint out, not only do our  12th graders do worse in <br/>\nmath and science, for example, than students in  almost <br/>\nall other industrialized countries, the longer our <br/>\nstudents are  in public schools, the worse they do in <br/>\nrelation to their international  peers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I hate to quibble with my friend Rev. Ray, I <br/>\nsuspect  it&#39;s NOT the last myth. The &quot;public school&quot; <br/>\nestablishment is certainly adept  at making up new myths <br/>\nwhen the public sniffs the rat in the current myth  <br/>\ndu jour.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe special is set to run Friday night at 10pm Eastern,  <br/>\n9pm Central, and again at 10pm Mountain, then Pacific, <br/>\nAlaska, and  Hawaii.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Alliance is hosting two teleconferences on Friday  <br/>\nnight.... open to all our Signatories of the Proclamation.... <br/>\nand the  public! <br/>\n<br/>\nThat means you are welcome to forward this to your <br/>\nown email  list .... or even your pesky brother-in-law <br/>\nwho thinks things are just ducky  in HIS local school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how you connect:<br/>\n<br/>\nFIRST  TELECONFERNCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be held 15 minutes after the show airs in  <br/>\nEastern and Central time zones:<br/>\n<br/>\n11:15pm Eastern.......10:15pm  Central<br/>\n<br/>\nMountain and West Coast people are welcome to come <br/>\non and get  a preview, if you will, from the reactions <br/>\nof those who have already seen  it.<br/>\n<br/>\n9:15pm Mountain....... 8:15pm Pacific.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlaska and Hawaii  folks.... and even those in Europe <br/>\nwho want to get up in the middle of the  night....are <br/>\nwelcome, too. But you gotta figure out the time for  <br/>\nyourself. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSECOND TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nA second  teleconference will be held three hours later: <br/>\n15 minutes after 20/20 airs  on the West Coast:<br/>\n<br/>\n11:15pm Pacific<br/>\nwhich is 12:15am  (Sat) Mountain<br/>\nand 1:15am Central, 2:15am Eastern<br/>\n<br/>\nWe may  get some Brits on the second teleconference, <br/>\nas it will be 7:15am Saturday  morning in England.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I was on the phone for an hour this  morning <br/>\nwith James Stanfield at the E G West Centre in England  <br/>\ndiscussing the show. James Tooley, Director of the <br/>\ncentre (who will  receive the Alexis de Tocqueville <br/>\nAward at SepCon2007, May 4-6, Dallas, was  just back <br/>\nfrom India and his sleep pattern may have him fit to <br/>\njoin us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHOW YOU DIAL THE TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing your cell or regular  telephone, from your own <br/>\neasy chair at home---or driving down the  highway---- <br/>\ndial this number at the appointed hour in your time <br/>\nzone  above:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 (319) 632-1100   pass code 682-129 #<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you  have a noisy background, just press 6 to mute <br/>\nyourself. When you want to say  something, press 6 again <br/>\nto un-mute.<br/>\n<br/>\nMISCLANEOUS  STUFF-----<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Stossel is apparently quite active in his blog <br/>\nand  frequently responds to emails.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to sound off with praise or a  suggestion <br/>\nabout a future education special, or both, you can <br/>\ndo so  here: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154\">http://forums.go.com/abcnews/2020/thread?threadID=284154</a>&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nor, if that is busted, try this link:  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/9qz5p\">http://tinyurl.com/9qz5p</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier, he wrote &quot;If you would  like to purchase a <br/>\ntape or dvd, dial 800-505-6139; for a transcript dial  <br/>\n818-848-6500.

How <br/>\nabsurd. As if government schools are  high quality. <br/>\nIn Florida, and most places, competition, which made <br/>\neven  the Postal Service improve, is unconstitutional <br/>\nwhen it comes to public  education.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo read the entire E Ray Moore news release about Stossel&#39;s  <br/>\neducation special, click here: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.earnedmedia.org/em0111.htm\">http://www.earnedmedia.org/em0111.htm</a>&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n======================================<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: Exodus Mandate  specializes in bringing to evangelical <br/>\nChristians the message to get their  children out of <br/>\nthe spiritually and morally &quot;officially Godless&quot; government  <br/>\nschools. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther note: The Alliance, from whom you are getting  <br/>\nthis email, is indeed an ***alliance*** of people of <br/>\nmany faiths,  religions, and worldviews. Indeed, it <br/>\njust might be the broadest alliance,  as measured by <br/>\nvariety of worldviews and political ideologies, in <br/>\nthe  history of man. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial note to non-religious people: I put most, but  <br/>\nnot all, of my energy into reaching religious people, <br/>\nespecially  evangelicals, Catholics, Jews, and Mormons. <br/>\nWhy? Here in the States, they  have the largest numbers!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also invest considerable time in trying  to reach <br/>\nsecularists and those with differing spiritual systems, <br/>\nfrom  atheists to agnostics, from Muslims to New Thought <br/>\nand New Age, and even an  occasional Druze, Russian <br/>\nOrthodox, and Zoroastrian.  <br/>\n<br/>\n==================================<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do not wish to receive  an email from me from <br/>\ntime to time (last year there were three or four; this  <br/>\nyear I am hoping to do almost one a month), please <br/>\nclick below.
