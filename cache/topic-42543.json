To be honest I saw the quote somewhere and took it as ..if we as a society are spending more time concerning ourselves with getting that new..fill in the blank..than we are paying attention to our children something is wrong. Ive decided to remove that signature while I read further and decide whether Mr.Phillips is someone I really want to quote or not. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to my original post. I was trying to make my request quick and to the point but I think being succinct wasn&#39;t the best idea in this case :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to give a bit of background and hopefully it will help explain the reason behind my request. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids. My oldest has been unschooling for a couple years now and is 10. My 6 year old wanted to go to school. She had a wonderful teacher in kindergarten and really enjoyed school. Then first grade started and she had a teacher who was keeping her in from recess almost daily when she wasnt finishing her work. Ill just skip forward here and say after 6 weeks of school my little girl decided home would be a much better place to be :) <br/>\n<br/>\n  My son is 8 years old but is severely autistic and nonverbal. He attends school . I simply cannot handle him all day every day. <br/>\n<br/>\n  In may of this year I suffered a cardiac arrest (from a genetic heart condition ) and was dead for several minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I also had surgery last Thursday. <br/>\n<br/>\n  While my son is 8 in age he is about a year mentally. I can&#39;t take my eyes off him for a minute. He runs outside and has no fear or understanding of cars. Puts just about anything in his mouth, loves to spill out lotion, shampoo, tooth paste , you name it on the floor . He is a handsome little boy who brings a smile to my face daily . My strength isn&#39;t what it used to be and he also exhausts me . <br/>\n<br/>\n  The girls are used to me doing things with them all day and I love it! Its like revisiting my childhood in a much happier way this time around :) <br/>\n<br/>\n  During these next couple of weeks while my son is off of school it is just impossible for me to...for example sit and build kenex, or read to them or even sit and watch a show all the way through with them..kenex is a nightmare he grabs the pieces and throws them around . Reading is read a sentence , get up and grab him the whatever he has gotten a hold of and is dumping on the floor this time out of his hand. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Financially we aren&#39;t doing well and at the moment its worse than usual . We just got done moving when we really didnt have the money to move. At our old house we had a convicted sex offender move in next door. The ages of his victims were 11 and 6. He kept walking his dog in front of our house really slowly and just staring but since he lived right next door as long as he wasn&#39;t coming into our yard there wasn&#39;t much that could be done about it. Late one night we heard a noise and my dh went out the backdoor and someone went out of our yard over our fence. It was pitch black and we have no proof of who it was. Our family was becoming more and more uncomfortable and it felt like my kids were prisoners in their own home. For everyones well being we decided to move now and worry about wether or not we could afford it later. We are struggling because of it at the moment we barely have money for food and gas for dh to get to work. Seeing my kids much<br/>\n happier<br/>\n<br/>\n  and feeling more secure after the move is definetly worth it though. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m looking for is suggestions for things for them to do .

I know money is tight, but I&#39;ve had good luck finding inexpensive games online, and also at pawn shops. There are also free online games they might enjoy at the major cartoon sites:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/\">http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nick.com/\">http://www.nick.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCan you create a temporary space in your home for games and toys with small parts? It seems so hard to have to put up the knex for a couple weeks, but beyond that there are a lot of fun crafty things the girls could probably do without help if they had a &quot;safe space&quot; in which to do them. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"need sugestions for cheap things to do over the next 2 weeks","postDate":"1261542665","msgId":42543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxNjI0LjM1ODU2LnFtQHdlYjM3NDA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42546,"prevInTime":42542,"nextInTime":42544,"topicId":42543,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"JJ, I want to thank you for those links.

To be honest I saw the quote somewhere and took it as ..if we as a society are spending more time concerning ourselves with getting that new..fill in the blank..than we are paying attention to our children something is wrong. Ive decided to remove that signature while I read further and decide whether Mr.Phillips is someone I really want to quote or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn to my original post. I was trying to make my request quick and to the point but I think being succinct wasn&#39;t the best idea in this case :) <br/>\n<br/>\nI need to give a bit of background and hopefully it will help explain the reason behind my request. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 kids. My oldest has been unschooling for a couple years now and is 10. My 6 year old wanted to go to school. She had a wonderful teacher in kindergarten and really enjoyed school. Then first grade started and she had a teacher who was keeping her in from recess almost daily when she wasnt finishing her work. Ill just skip forward here and say after 6 weeks of school my little girl decided home would be a much better place to be :) <br/>\nMy son is 8 years old but is severely autistic and nonverbal. He attends school . I simply cannot handle him all day every day. <br/>\nIn may of this year I suffered a cardiac arrest (from a genetic heart condition ) and was dead for several minutes. <br/>\nI also had surgery last Thursday. <br/>\nWhile my son is 8 in age he is about a year mentally. I can&#39;t take my eyes off him for a minute. He runs outside and has no fear or understanding of cars. Puts just about anything in his mouth, loves to spill out lotion, shampoo, tooth paste , you name it on the floor . He is a handsome little boy who brings a smile to my face daily . My strength isn&#39;t what it used to be and he also exhausts me . <br/>\nThe girls are used to me doing things with them all day and I love it! Its like revisiting my childhood in a much happier way this time around :) <br/>\nDuring these next couple of weeks while my son is off of school it is just impossible for me to...for example sit and build kenex, or read to them or even sit and watch a show all the way through with them..kenex is a nightmare he grabs the pieces and throws them around . Reading is read a sentence , get up and grab him the whatever he has gotten a hold of and is dumping on the floor this time out of his hand. <br/>\nFinancially we aren&#39;t doing well and at the moment its worse than usual . We just got done moving when we really didnt have the money to move. At our old house we had a convicted sex offender move in next door. The ages of his victims were 11 and 6. He kept walking his dog in front of our house really slowly and just staring but since he lived right next door as long as he wasn&#39;t coming into our yard there wasn&#39;t much that could be done about it. Late one night we heard a noise and my dh went out the backdoor and someone went out of our yard over our fence. It was pitch black and we have no proof of who it was. Our family was becoming more and more uncomfortable and it felt like my kids were prisoners in their own home. For everyones well being we decided to move now and worry about wether or not we could afford it later. We are struggling because of it at the moment we barely have money for food and gas for dh to get to work. Seeing my kids much happier<br/>\n and feeling more secure after the move is definetly worth it though. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I&#39;m looking for is suggestions for things for them to do . Ways to mix things up a bit and help them have fun while I am giving their brother the attention he needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42421,"nextTopicId":42500}}
