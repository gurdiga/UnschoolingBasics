It helped our son to know how long we were going to be out, to know that at 3pm we were leaving. Keeping playdates short (1 - 1 1/2 hours) worked way better for him - it&#39;s short enough that he didn&#39;t generally get hungry or too over-stimulated. It also helped to really watch for cues, for us to learn what he might be showing us before we saw anger, and help him to see it too. I only put him in group situations where I felt that I could be readily available to him if he were to need me, and where he felt comfortable with the other kids and parents. We started going to only small group functions, avoiding big classes for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed that when my son is in a place of anger, the best I can do is love him, hug him, and probably take him home.

That way someone could keep an eye out for any needs or frustrations and address them right away - other kids can&#39;t do that. When Ray&#39;s needs were being met promptly (and at best proactively) he had the ability to be marvelously kind and sympathetic to others. If not, his needs were in the way of his own empathy - he could only take care of Himself, not others, if you see what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Part of me wants to stay home with him and never go out, for fear of his behavior.<br/>\n************ ******<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found it helped enormously with Ray to only take him out socially if he was in a good &quot;space&quot; - not hungry or tired or already frustrated - And there was an adult willing to be his buddy.

While this might seem counter-intuitive (you want him to learn social skills, but are cutting back social opportunities) we found it started to pay off sooner than we expected because overall more of Ray&#39;s social encounters were successful. That gave all of us the opportunity to learn what worked for him - we got better at facilitating and He got better at knowing when to turn to us for help, rather than lashing out. We all got more confident, and Ray felt better about himself. That last meant he had more energy available for others&#39; needs, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was also important to put extra energy into meeting his needs promptly (and as I said before, proactively best of all) at home so that his overall frustration was lower. Again, it boosted his self confidence and led to him having more impulse control and more access to his own empathy.

After 11 heart surgeries and several other procedures.  He&#39;s doing physically great now.  In December of 2008 we started home-schooling, then un-schooling last month.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share that early story about his life because sometimes I wonder if he doesn&#39;t really understand empathy and some other social skills because he was so sick when he was young and didn&#39;t have the opportunity to play with other kids.  And, his dad and I were so stressed by the situation that we indulged him and had little energy to support his learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has struggled with social skills and has a particularly hard time with empathy.  He is quick to say, out loud, that he &quot;hates&quot; another kid (especially a younger kid) and refuses to play with anyone he has decided he hates.  He can be quick to get physical too.  He can also be rough with pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel numb when he does something mean.  And, I don&#39;t know what to do.  Sometimes I talk to him about it.  In the past, sometimes I might have punished him, although, if you&#39;d ask my daughter, she&#39;d say I never punished him at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany a mother has spoken to me about not wanting her kids around him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my daughter, 11, is a pleasure to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the reason I took him out of school was to get a handle on this so that he could have an easier time with other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes his dad will explode in anger, yelling, and grabbing him and hauling him up to his bed room, tossing him into the room.  This doesn&#39;t happen often.  It usually happens when I have come to the end of my ability to handle a situation and my son is yelling at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son used to hit me, but now he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve gone to counseling, and the counselor says that he&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of me wants to stay home with him and never go out, for fear of his behavior.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to find some other moms who have worked through something like this.
