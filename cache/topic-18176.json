One of the things that was taught to us<br/>\nwhen we went through leadership training is that variation of the<br/>\ngiven requirements of the badges is COMPLETELY acceptable.  It&#39;s not<br/>\nabout exaclty duplicating the badge requirements, it&#39;s about<br/>\nunderstanding the subject!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else suggested finding a new troop and if coming to some<br/>\nagreement with this leader is not working I would say find a new<br/>\nleader.  My girls decided a few years ago to quit GS when we started<br/>\nunschooling.  They felt out of place, different and thought too much<br/>\noutside the box for GS.  They still respect and remember fondly their<br/>\nGS years, but we never found the same connection that we had with our<br/>\nformer troops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother person suggested Juliettes.  If she still wants to do the  GS<br/>\nwork but not do troop functions this is another option.  If she is<br/>\nwanting GS for the socialization then go for that reason and don&#39;t<br/>\nsweat the badge work.  If it were me and I would probably ask to speak<br/>\nto the leader on neutral ground (maybe over a cuppa at Starbuck&#39;s some<br/>\nday) and ask why your daughter&#39;s work was unacceptable as she expanded<br/>\nupon the exercise that was presented.  I would explain a bit about<br/>\nunschooling and what it is that your daughter (and you for your<br/>\ndaughter) want out of it.  I wouldn&#39;t completely give up on this<br/>\ntroop.  You might be able to shed a bit of light for this Leader.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, our troop did that badge once and we did NONE of the requirements<br/>\nfrom the book.

She recently joined a new Girl Scout Troop and today was her fourth meeting. She has generally liked it, very happy with the trips, fundraisers, going through the badge book with me and planning to do lots at home. She was in tears after the meeting today....it had to do with a puzzle badge that the troop is working on at the meeting. The leader gave the girls a paper that explained a puzzle in which the girls had to give letters a certain money value and come up with words that equaled $1.00. Fran understood it perfectly, but invented her own puzzle with words, where she took a bigger word and broke it down into smaller words(she and I like to do this together at home!) and gave those words values. When I was picking her up, the leader called us aside and explained to &quot;me&quot; what the puzzle was all about and that Fran did not understand. Later at home, after<br/>\nhearing the whole story, I understood that it wasn&#39;t her understanding that was lacking, but she explained to me that it wasn&#39;t a puzzle that she wanted to do,so she had made up her own. Why wasn&#39;t that acceptable? She further explained to me that the troop doesn&#39;t run the way things run at home....she likes the freedom she has here (her words!) The leader had told the girls that they all had to do this one puzzle to work towards the badge and that felt very stifling to her. <br/>\nWe talked for a bit about the way the troop was run vs. our way....and I told her that maybe what we need to talk about next is whether being in the troop and doing the fun stuff outweighs the not fun stuff.
