When a person has a need the only way to help them is to <br/>\nhelp<br/>\nthem fill the need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Cameron was in school, the school sponsored a parenting class. <br/>\nWith a psychiatrist. I knew him. We&#39;d gone to school together. He&#39;s a <br/>\n3-5 years younger than I am. Shaw Evans.<br/>\n<br/>\nANyway, he was leading this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told a story of an eight year old girl whose parents had recently <br/>\ndivorced. She was in school all day and in after-school care every <br/>\nafternoon until 5:00 when someone would pick her up from school. She <br/>\nhad soccer and dance classes in the evenings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMom worked all day and was tired at night.  So tired that they rarely <br/>\ncooked at home---fast food or sandwiches. Dad was gone---she saw him <br/>\none weekend each month.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe child desperately wanted to sleep with her mom at night. Mom made <br/>\nher go to bed in her room. When the child started to come into the <br/>\nmom&#39;s room in the middle of the night, the psychiatrist&#39;s suggestion <br/>\nwas to LOCK THE CHILD IN HER ROOM AT BEDTIME!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI started freaking out. I was hyper-ventilating. I kept saying to Ben, <br/>\n&quot;We need to go we need to go now I need to go we have to leave now I <br/>\nneed to go! Nownownow!&quot; We walked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere was a LITTLE girl. Little! Eight!. Her dad had moved out. Her mom <br/>\nworked all day. Child was engaged with everyone *except* a parent all <br/>\nday. When she finally got home, she *needed* to connect with mom. Mom <br/>\nsimply wanted time to herself. Time to be alone. She *was* a single <br/>\nmom, afterall and needed time to regroup every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they locked the little girl in her room every night. The child <br/>\ncurled in a ball at the door of her room and cried herself to sleep <br/>\nevery night for weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter *only* a month, the child quit crying and started sleeping in her <br/>\nbed. Never bothered the mom at night again. Success story!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, the child&#39;s neediness didn&#39;t outweigh the adult&#39;s <br/>\nneediness. Even though the adult had many more years of ecperience. I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing that the trust lost will come back to bite this mom HARD in <br/>\nthe butt. Poor little girl.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
