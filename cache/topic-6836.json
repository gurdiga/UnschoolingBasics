Looking at the picture it seems it would be pretty simple to <br/>\nmake a &#39;shell&#39; that would fit over the lower tiers to make it look <br/>\nlike a volcano. I&#39;d also suggest putting some holes or &#39;valleys&#39; or <br/>\nsomething in any &#39;shell&#39; so that the chocolate can drip back into <br/>\nthe bottom catch tray which allows it to be recirculated (instead of <br/>\njust running all over...can&#39;t let chocolate get wasted loL!) Or <br/>\nmaybe curl the base of the mountain a bit to create a chocolate <br/>\nriver that funnels the chocolate back into the drip tray area.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1224177,"authorName":"Saulithyia@aol.com","from":"Saulithyia@...","profile":"saulithyia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: ideas for a &quot;real&quot; erupting chocolate volcano...H...","postDate":"1127833681","msgId":6836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1OS41YTMwZDk3NS4zMDZhYmE1MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6837,"prevInTime":6835,"nextInTime":6837,"topicId":6836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/26/2005 11:59:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time, cherokeecain@yahoo.com writes: I had a  friend recently telling me about someone becoming","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-950824592\">In a message dated 9/26/2005 11:59:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cherokeecain@...\">cherokeecain@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a  friend recently telling me about someone becoming involved in <br/>\nwedding planning  and one thing this lady was getting was a chocolate fountain. <br/>\nMaybe worth  checking into as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nOoo, I&#39;ve seen one of those, smaller and priced lower, or in-home use...
