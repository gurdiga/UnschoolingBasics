Realizing that introverts need time to observe is also important - extroverts learn about social situations by diving in to the middle of them, introverts learn by watching and listening and &quot;getting a feel&quot; for things, and Then getting involved.

She might sit and watch her movie for the whole event, or watch for awhile and then join in, or play for awhile and then go watch her movie.

Of course it could be useless, but it could also be a seasoned professional saying and doing the exact same things you would say if you had a lot more parenting experience<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy couldn&#39; the parents be with this kid in social situations and do the same?<br/>\nWhat if the parents also helped this child find friends of ALL ages that are interrested in the same stuff this child is?<br/>\nYou are a comparing mainstream parented kid in school. Unschooling parents need to be there present to guide their child in social situations specially if they do need their help navigating  thru them.<br/>\nThere is no reason to have to get you child fixed by a professional if a parent that knows and loves this child can be there as a guide/buffer/ model.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did this above parent tell this child? You need to  go to therapy to learn to get along with other kids?<br/>\nTHis is a group so you leanr to behave better with kids your age?<br/>\nDid this child get the feeling there was something wrong  with himself? or just something not right?<br/>\nIf a parent is not willing to be there present and guide/help/partner with his/her child than this parent should not be unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":346820406,"authorName":"hunnybunnies5@verizon.net","from":"&lt;hunnybunnies5@...&gt;","profile":"shelleydaez","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239205672","msgId":39375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBRTA2ODk1NUJGQzQ4Nzk4QjBCODYzRTY1RTk0ODAzQHJvYnlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":39374,"nextInTopic":39377,"prevInTime":39374,"nextInTime":39377,"topicId":39348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It was a play group for younger kids. When there was a problem, the therapist would help the kids understand what went wrong. This particular kid, fascinating to me as an adult, was boring the snot out of other kids by going on and on about things they weren&#39;t interested in. The therapist helped him notice the clues that showed they weren&#39;t interested, and helped him put together a list of various things the other kids WOULD want to do/talk about. The therapist did not tell him to never pursue these &quot;boring&quot; interests, just consider his audience. Yes, this kid was in school, but I think it could be similar to learning to have a better time with neighborhood kids or the local playgroup. I&#39;m not saying you SHOULD do it. I just wanted to let you know that it was a positive experience for him. At the time I wished there was a group like that for me! :) I would definitely want to offer it as a choice. Of course it could be useless, but it could also be a seasoned professional saying and doing the exact same things you would say if you had a lot more parenting experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlex<br/>\nmama to Katya, 22 mos</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about ds&#39;s intense interests","postDate":"1239163023","msgId":39359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1OTUwMy41NjA1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAxLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFEMjgzRjREODdCOTREMjE5MDk2OUI2MkMxMjk3M0EzQHJvYnlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":39358,"nextInTopic":39360,"prevInTime":39358,"nextInTime":39360,"topicId":39348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is that all right?

We&#39;ve always done this when it comes to birthday celebrations in the family.  When ds 12 wanted to celebrate his birthday by visiting the National Marine Corps Museum for the 2nd time, 16 yo dd and I enjoyed it the first time when we went together as a family before his birthday.  But we did not particularly relish having to go a 2nd time, even if it WAS his birthday.  Not being military history buffs, once was enough for us.  But since it was ds 12&#39;s birthday, we all went as a family.  We just thought of it as a sacrifice to do for love of him because he wanted us all to be with him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a family tradition you think we should adjust or change to better suit the needs of each family member?  I am open to suggestions, especially since I am still learning the ropes of unschooling and peaceful parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Could you have made the trip more<br/>\n&gt; appealing to him in some way? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, we passed by the FDR Memorial and took pictures, since it was our 1st time, and since we knew ds would be interested because of FDR&#39;s role in WWII.  Then, ds 8 wanted to do some Japanese crafts in the craft tent offered by the Junior Rangers.  Ds 12 ended up enjoying it as well, making a paper Japanese lantern and an origami leaping frog.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My oldest son is quite often like this.

Some people <br/>\n&gt; enjoy tagging along to activities and some do not. I don&#39;t see <br/>\n&gt; a problem with that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>THANK YOU for making me see things in this light.  I didn&#39;t realize that this could be what ds goes through whenever new things come up.  And thanks for letting me know that ACCEPTANCE is key -- that, following your example, I don&#39;t always have to see it as a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Are you insisting that you always have to be together?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, not really -- only on birthday celebrations.  But are you suggesting that we don&#39;t have to celebrate as a family?  That would take some getting used to for all of us, since we&#39;ve always thought of birthday celebrations as a family affair -- you know, being there for your loved one on his special day....  Same for Christmas, Thanksgiving -- you know -- the big holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has Asperger&#39;s no more than I have ADD.

Yes, I wish we could do away with labels and just accept each other lovingly or supportively, without having to *fix* things, or see differences are problems.

So we are trying to work on both -- the former, by offering new things and asking him to try it just for a short while (like reading aloud from a book or watching a dvd that doesn&#39;t have to do with military history and telling him that he doesn&#39;t have to continue listening or watching if he doesn&#39;t like it -- though, most of the time, he ends up enjoying it) -- and we respect his choice if he does not want to continue listening or watching, as long as he tries it even just a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that all right?

I don&#39;t have any real advice bit wanted to let u know that someone else has similar concerns. My concerns are a little more involved as it seems no matter how supportive I am, my son is still chronically not concerned with others feelings. He is also extremely bright and will enjoy himself despite some initial complaint ( seems to be his general mood unless he is doing what he wants in that moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll my best--Kelli <br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 6, 2009, at 9:00 PM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hunnybunnies5@...\">hunnybunnies5@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nHello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 yo ds has been a military history buff for about 3 years now.
