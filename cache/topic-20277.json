I&#39;m so glad I fell in love  with a man who has the same regard for his <br/>\nparents and who&#39;s parents have  the same regard for theirs! Its a really GREAT way <br/>\nto feel and life sure  is happy for all involved. <br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe my childhood was sheltered but I thank God  for that! We all turned out <br/>\nvery healthy and didn&#39;t get ourselves  into the kind of trouble that I&#39;ve <br/>\nseen ruin people; early sex, drugs,  self-disrespecting behavior. I DID feel <br/>\nloved by &quot;you better not&quot; and I  still feel loved when my better half tells me <br/>\nwhat streets he doesn&#39;t want  me driving on (because they are unsafe) or how late <br/>\nat night it too late  to go to the market (also because of safety). <br/>\n <br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t as if something &quot;bad&quot; will happen in our  relationship if I do <br/>\ngo to the market after dark; I&#39;ll simply come  home to some comment like &quot;so <br/>\nyou like being out with the muggers?&quot; (think  an episode of Raymond) it is all <br/>\nvery tongue and cheek, joking yet a  little serious at the same time, and very <br/>\nloving as in &quot;if I didn&#39;t love  you I wouldn&#39;t tell you what to do.&quot; I TRULY <br/>\nthink this could just be  a cultural thing because he is Italian and I am <br/>\nextremely ethnic as well  (Croatian, similar culturally) and we tell each other and <br/>\nour children and  our parents and friends, etc...  that we love one another  <br/>\nby being busy bodies and telling each other what to do constantly.  Maybe if <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t part of our culture you can&#39;t understand it. I  would be DEVASTATED <br/>\n(and feel very unloved) if I wore a new outfit in  front or my mom, aunts and <br/>\nsisters and it didn&#39;t get &quot;critiqued&quot; in a  multitude of ways (just perfect, <br/>\ntoo tight in the butt, do you think  you are Brittany Spears, you shouldn&#39;t <br/>\nwear stripes, makes you look busty,  etc...) to which I would respond &quot;kiss my <br/>\ntoo tight ass&quot; and everyone  would burst into laughter and hug. When we leave <br/>\neach other alone and  do what normal people call &quot;respectful&quot; it is actually (in <br/>\nour culture) a  way of being really mean to  someone.          <br/>\n <br/>\nIn terms of the pregnancy thing, the &quot;light and regular&quot;  way of saying it in <br/>\nmy family every now and then (this was always in  response to finding out <br/>\nthat some kid at school had done something they  didn&#39;t approve of) was &quot;you <br/>\nbetter not&quot; but it was really more of just a  knee-jerk thing to say than the only <br/>\nway they said it. There were the rare  occasions that we&#39;d be sitting at the <br/>\ntable or going to bed and brushing  our teeth and they would go into more <br/>\ndepth about how they felt about it.  That if we did something like that, we would <br/>\nthen have to be 100%  responsible for the baby financially and otherwise which <br/>\nmeant no more  riding lessons, no more ponies, no more music lessons, and of <br/>\ncourse  living on our own - all things we didn&#39;t want happening. They made it  <br/>\nVERY CLEAR that they would love us and be &quot;in love&quot; with us forever no  mat<br/>\nter what, but they wouldn&#39;t support us financially because when you  have sex <br/>\nyou MUST be old enough to support yourself and take  care of all the <br/>\nconsequences that sex can lead to. What could  be wrong with that. So really, they <br/>\nweren&#39;t saying &quot;no&quot; to  sex, they were saying &quot;if you do it, you should be prepared <br/>\nto live  as an adult, and we will be sad about that (and feel disgraced as a  <br/>\nfamily) but will love you no matter what.&quot; To me that is very  HEALTHY, <br/>\ntruthful and practical. <br/>\n <br/>\nAdriana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] No.","postDate":"1168134398","msgId":20349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMjM2Ljk5MjE0LnFtQHdlYjUzODE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwOS43MTJhODVlOS4zMmQxMzMxZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20346,"nextInTopic":20359,"prevInTime":20348,"nextInTime":20350,"topicId":20277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"maybe my parents said it with more respect and love? none of us rebelled, we just loved our parents even more when they set boundaries. it made us feel safe.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1326801860\">maybe my parents said it with more respect and love? none of us rebelled, we <br/>\njust loved our parents even more when they set boundaries. it made us feel <br/>\nsafe. but our parents were EXTREMELY affectionate and loving and attached to <br/>\nus (like glue) still are! :-)<br/>\nAdriana <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  How do you threaten to kill your child and do it with respect and love?

I knew that in the throws of passion, they weren&#39;t going to stop because I said so.

LOL.  That&#39;s what he thought of having sex.  My oldest kept them for awhile & threw them away when they expired ( didn&#39;t use any )  and asked me to get him more just incase.  Neither of them (to my knowledge) got anyone pregnant or came home with a STD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew from the beginning  ~ and from experience ~  that my mom saying &quot;No, sex is not for the unmarried&quot;  didn&#39;t stop me from becoming pregnant at the age of 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of saying no ........  listen & talk with your teens.

I remember almost instantly respecting her and loving<br/>\nher<br/>\neven more than I already did and Lord knows I never smoked one of those or<br/>\neven stood NEXT to someone smoking after that! My mom is my best friend<br/>\nin  the<br/>\nwhole world and sometimes best friends have to get tough with each  other. I<br/>\nrespect the heck out of my parents for sometimes having to get  tough and<br/>\nfeel<br/>\nsorry for children who don&#39;t have that in their  lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents said similar things and I rebelled big time - drugs, sex,<br/>\nalcohol, staying at boyfriends homes overnight instead of where I said I<br/>\nwould be, lying etc; so I guess everyone responds differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know my kids are relating to me a whole lot better since I have become<br/>\nmore conscious about how I word my &#39;no&#39;s&#39;.  And since I&#39;ve been conscious of<br/>\nletting go of unnecessary control (necessary control for me would be to<br/>\navoid a life threatening situation as described by you), they are more<br/>\nresponsible, think about things more and whether they really wanted what<br/>\nthey asked for after all, just an all round better situation for the whole<br/>\nfamily.  Plus, and its a big plus, my life (and I&#39;m thinking theirs too) is<br/>\nmore peaceful and joy filled.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 06/01/07, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/5/2007 6:22:06 P.M.
