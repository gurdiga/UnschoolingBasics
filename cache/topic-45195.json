I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-561320583\">I have always had some of the same issues with fabrics and other things on my <br/>\nskin. When I was little all the sensory information was not what it is today. I <br/>\nhad to have all the tags removed from all my clothing and was restricted to only <br/>\ncotton. My son also has some of these issues and of course some of his own ways <br/>\nof dealing with sensory input. We did the OT thing for a while but I found that <br/>\nreally with some reading and communication we could figure out what he lacked or <br/>\nneeded more of. I have read a lot about this just very curious cause when I <br/>\nreally started looking closer I found that I had a ton of these so called <br/>\n&quot;issues&quot;  I think honestly it is just a hyper sensitive thing, perhaps <br/>\nneurological. I was reading some information about the nerves of the skin just <br/>\nbeing in hyper drive with feeling sensations. So what may be a little itchy <br/>\nmaterial to one, this person feels like a million bugs are all over them. I am <br/>\nnot a doctor that is for sure but here is some food for thought from my personal <br/>\nand sons experience thus far. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe free and clear soap is better but I found that the detergent with no <br/>\nsulfates/chemical free is easier to tolerated, seven generation is one. But <br/>\nhonestly just a mixture of baking soda and vinegar is GREAT, more affordable but <br/>\nnot to much baking soda because it will be rough if not rinsed all the way.  <br/>\nStubborn stains can be lifted with hydrogen peroxide versus spray n wash<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe use only cotton one because it breaths and two because it is the only thing <br/>\nmy skin will withstand. I know this sounds weird but used cotton sheets may be <br/>\nbetter for her because they have been broken in. I am not this sensitive now but <br/>\nonce was. Also try to get sheets for her that are not full of color, the dye is <br/>\na chemical and does transfer, she may have an allergy to one of them. They do <br/>\nsale organic linens but they are $, we just get white.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Then maybe try stimulating her legs before bed, rub them down with warm olive <br/>\noil. This kinda lets her nerves know they are going to be touched then the <br/>\nsensation of the sheets rubbing on her is not so stimulating. If she does not <br/>\nlike you doing it then maybe it would feel better to her if she rubbed her own <br/>\nlegs before bed. There is this brushing tech for the skin we have not used it as <br/>\nmassage is very welcomed in our home and helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps some and I hope she can find some comfort. It honestly is one <br/>\nof those things were you just kinda experiment and then she will find what works <br/>\nfor her and stick with it, or at least that was me<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJessica<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Everybody is a genius.

Those","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2100576069\">Is it RLS?  (Restless Leg Syndrome)   I have this and it drives me nuts. From wikipedia: &quot;The sensations are unusual and unlike other common sensations. Those with RLS have a hard time describing them, using words like: uncomfortable, &quot;antsy&quot;, electrical, creeping, painful, itching, pins and needles, pulling, creepy-crawly, ants inside the legs and numbness.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s very different than leg cramps -- for me it&#39;s creepy-crawly / antsy, and I have to move my legs. Happens to me mostly at night and I have a hard time falling asleep because of it sometimes.<br/>\n <br/>\nSounds like you need to chat w/your doc to see if they have ideas.  For a switch in sheets, my kids have sensitive skin and really, really love their fleece sheets. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Sheets/Fleece,/material,/1/subcat.html\">http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Sheets/Fleece,/material,/1/subcat.html</a>  <br/>\n <br/>\n-Renee<br/>\n <br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":84690835,"authorName":"Gayle","from":"&quot;Gayle&quot; &lt;harmonyglb@...&gt;","profile":"harmonyglb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"OT- sensory problem","postDate":"1288440705","msgId":45195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlhaDIyMStra2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45199,"prevInTime":45194,"nextInTime":45196,"topicId":45195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dd has recently started complaining that her legs feel weird at night, kind of like an uncomfortable, burning, tingly sensation on the skin, not the deeper","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-975758075\">My dd has recently started complaining that her legs feel weird at night, kind of like an uncomfortable, burning, tingly sensation on the skin, not the deeper pain felt with muscle cramps. She is having trouble sleeping through the night and says the sheets &quot;hurt&quot; her because they are so smooth. I have also had similar experiences, especially with some clothes touching my legs, so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a genetic thing or what. We&#39;ve tried switching to Free & Clear detergents(which helps me), but so far nothing is helping her. We&#39;ve also tried putting down a towel or blanket on her bed and that seems to help for a while, but I&#39;d really like to know what is going on. Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45342,"nextTopicId":45344}}
