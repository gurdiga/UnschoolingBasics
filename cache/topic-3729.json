She knows a fun song that rhymes.  Later it will be relevant as to being the alphabet.  A lot of kids learn this way, but I&#39;m not so sure it is the best way to teach reading.

For right now what is important is dancning and fingerplay.  And don&#39;t discredit fingerplay.  All those fun little fingerplay songs like Ittsy Bittsy Spider, 3 Little Monkeys, 10 Little Sausages, etc are great for fine motor skill building!  So even though it looks like play, she is gaining something from doing it.  She is learning to coordinate her fingers which later will lead to writing (not immediately, but in the long run.)  Dancing leads to coordination.  They learn balance, rhythm, and how to move different parts of their body independently.  These are important building blocks in learning things like hopscotch, tumbling, jumping, hopping, skipping, skipping rope, etc.  So I would say for now the important thing for an 18 mo IS dancing and finger play.  She&#39;s *only* 18 mo.  That&#39;s still a baby in my book.  Her job right now in life is experiencing the world around her.  She will learn to read and do math ... when she has need for these skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I <br/>\n&gt; want to find ways to gently expose the kids to reading and math. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Read, read read.  Read not only to her, but for your own enjoyment.  Show her the joy of reading.  Sit with her on your lap and read to her familiar stories.  She doesn&#39;t need to know about word structure or sentence compostion or what makes a good story.  She just wants (and most children do want - not all though) to be read to and have fun stories told to her in a fun way!  To learn to enjoy words.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I <br/>\n&gt; might not double a batch of cookies just to teach fractions, but I <br/>\n&gt; could see myself getting enthusiastic about how cool it is to <br/>\n&gt; understand measurements and encouraging the kids to experiment with <br/>\n&gt; them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t make a double batch of cookies just to teach fractions either.  I do make double batches of cookies because we like cookies and in the process my kids learn to figure out fractions in a fun way without being told, &quot;OK, today kids we are going to learn about fractions.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve only been deschooling for a few months and the kids are still <br/>\n&gt; very young, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s hope for me to learn to trust that <br/>\n&gt; they will learn what they need when they need it, without me hovering <br/>\n&gt; and worrying.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give them time.  Let them play.  Let them be kids.  The math and the reading will come when there is a need.
