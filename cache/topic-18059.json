I would have responded formally to everyone but we are moving and I have been temporarily disconnected from the internet, aside from sneaking peaks at work, which I am doing now!<br/>\nFortunately my daughter has always had a thick skin and definately a &quot;different drummer&quot; kind of mentality. The very next day she asked if she could invite the friend to go with us up to the mountains. I said: &quot;I thought you were angry with her for not sticking up for you.&quot; And she said: &quot;Well, I thought about it and I cant really expect them to know anything about how homeschooling or unschooling works. I didnt know myself until you explained it to me. I really dont care what they think anymore.&quot;  So she solved it on her own. <br/>\nAs an aside....I had enrolled her in an online writing course because I thought it would help her pass the CHSPE, which is her goal for the year, but after I saw what a schoolish slog it was I got my money back. Maybe she will even change her mind about taking the CHSPE. She&#39;s still deschooling (as am I). She made some remark about the fact that she&#39;s reading too much stuff  &quot;thats below my grade level.&quot; I wish I could get her to interact more with unschoolers, but its hard to meet them. She is still mostly focused on keeping in contact with her schooled friends. <br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no supportive parents and they have made it clear to my <br/>\ndaughter what<br/>\ntheir opinions are.

He caught <br/>\na LOT of flack from his friends and their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it was that he was able to do things they couldn&#39;t---and at <br/>\nthe time, it wasn&#39;t the cool stuff he&#39;s doing now. It was sleeping in <br/>\nand playing on the computer and watching TV all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of it was that he&#39;d left a private college prep school. They all <br/>\nKNEW he wouldn&#39;t know ANYTHING or EVER get into college. His former <br/>\nclassmates would IM him, saying that he would be NOTHING. He&#39;d call me <br/>\nin and ask me to write to them and assure them that he wouldn&#39;t. HE <br/>\nbelieved it TOO! It was really heart-breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere wasn&#39;t much I could do but assure him that he&#39;d be fine. Over <br/>\nand over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents too. Carly&#39;s mom asked good questions but later told Carly <br/>\nthat I was &quot;flighty.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt; She was funny about having Carly date Cam <br/>\nbecause she knew that he would amount to nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly.... &lt;g&gt; ....she htinks the WORLD of Cameron---he&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>\nkindest, smartest,... &lt;g&gt; she goes on and on and on. &lt;G&gt; She&#39;s very <br/>\nsupportive of him. She *still* thinks school is necessary and it was <br/>\nmerely a fluke that Cam turned out so well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCam&#39;s friends&#39; parents were horrible---telling their kids how crazy <br/>\n*I* was and how messed up Cam would be. One of them especially---Noah&#39;s <br/>\ndad, moved to Charleston and had to make a decision about what to do <br/>\nwith Noah and his last year of high school.

He&#39;d call me <br/>\nin and ask me to write to them and assure them that he wouldn&#39;t. HE <br/>\nbelieved it TOO! It was really heart-breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There wasn&#39;t much I could do but assure him that he&#39;d be fine. Over <br/>\nand over.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The parents too. Carly&#39;s mom asked good questions but later told Carly <br/>\nthat I was &quot;flighty.&quot; &lt;bwg&gt; She was funny about having Carly date Cam <br/>\nbecause she knew that he would amount to nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oddly.... &lt;g&gt; ....she htinks the WORLD of Cameron---he&#39;s the sweetest, <br/>\nkindest, smartest,... &lt;g&gt; she goes on and on and on. &lt;G&gt; She&#39;s very <br/>\nsupportive of him. She *still* thinks school is necessary and it was <br/>\nmerely a fluke that Cam turned out so well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cam&#39;s friends&#39; parents were horrible---telling their kids how crazy <br/>\n*I* was and how messed up Cam would be. One of them especially---Noah&#39;s <br/>\ndad, moved to Charleston and had to make a decision about what to do <br/>\nwith Noah and his last year of high school. Final decision was to have <br/>\nhim live with his mom that last year. BUT! &lt;g&gt; He said he wished he&#39;d <br/>\nUNschooled Noah before so that he wouldn&#39;t have had to go to his senior <br/>\nyear here. Now it was &quot;just too late.&quot; Bummer. But he&#39;d actually SEEN <br/>\nthe difference between Cam&#39;s learning life and Noah&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The in-laws were also a pain in the butt. With them, I simply waved my <br/>\nhand dismissively and said, &quot;Proof&#39;s in the puddin&#39;, and I&#39;m a patient <br/>\ncook.&quot; Five years later, I&#39;m a genius! &lt;g&gt; Cameron is the only <br/>\ngrandchild over fifteen that hasn&#39;t had (or been a part of) an <br/>\nabortion, hasn&#39;t been arrested, hasn&#39;t been in re-hab, hasn&#39;t been on <br/>\nprobation, hasn&#39;t gotten a tattoo (BIG issue with the in-laws), and <br/>\nhasn&#39;t been fired from a job. Not only that, but my <br/>\n&quot;over-fifteen-year-old&quot; isn&#39;&#39;t surly or mean or inconsiderate or <br/>\nimpolite or afraid of adults---in fact he&#39;s just the opposite! I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking GOOOOOD! &lt;BWG&gt; Well, I&#39;m still seen as weird and <br/>\nunconventional, but my kids aren&#39;t screwed up. I must be doing <br/>\nsomething right, huh? Anyway---they don&#39;t question it constantly or <br/>\njust KNOW I&#39;m ruining my boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d certainly reassure your daughter that NOW---as a <br/>\nfreshman---*everything* hangs on the grades and what all you do in <br/>\nextracurricular junk. They really *know* that these years in school are <br/>\nSOOO important. They place very high expectations now. High school is <br/>\nvery exciting---it&#39;s not middle school any more, and it&#39;s *REAL*!<br/>\n<br/>\n  BUT in less than two years, it&#39;s all crap. They hate their classes. <br/>\nThey hate their classmates. All teachers are idiots. They&#39;re tired and <br/>\nhungry, and have no time for anything *THEY* deem important. School <br/>\ntakes too much time. They lose passion and freedom and joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You can tell this all you want. She won&#39;t believe it. But as the time <br/>\ngoes, she WILL see it. It&#39;ll be gradual and a real downer to see her <br/>\nfriends so miserable. But eventually she&#39;ll see how great she has it. <br/>\nSo will her friends. &lt;g&gt; Things&#39;ll change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If she would like to talk with Cameron, he&#39;d be happy to correspond <br/>\nvia e-mail---or she can call him with any questions. He knows NOW how <br/>\nwonderful these last six years have been even though it didn&#39;t look so <br/>\ngood when he started. He had a hard time making the adjustment. But he <br/>\ncan really talk about he benefits now that he can look back. Let me <br/>\nknow whether she&#39;s interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know how hard it is to convince her. You can try, but only time will <br/>\nmake it clear to her (and her friends!).<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

This friend is attending a private high <br/>\nschool in the ninth grade. Her parents are separated and my daughter <br/>\nhas always been really fond of her Dad. They were at her Dad&#39;s <br/>\nhouse. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the morning, at about 9am, my daughter overheard the Dad (who <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she admires and looks up to) speaking with his daughter about going <br/>\nto the beach. They thought she was sleeping, but she was not. They <br/>\nbegan to talk about whether to invite my daughter to the beach, when <br/>\nthe Dad suddenly started &quot;trashing&quot; her and her foray into <br/>\nhomeschooling, saying negative things like &quot;she&#39;ll never go to <br/>\ncollege, she cant even get up in the morning, etc etc etc.&quot; Then the <br/>\ndaughter chimed in, trying to gain points with the Dad by elevating <br/>\nherself in her Dad&#39;s eyes at the expense of my daughter. Needless to <br/>\nsay, overhearing this stuff from a parent she always liked and from <br/>\nher best friend to boot, plunged her into a very hurtful state. I <br/>\ncame home to find her back to her surly, argumentative self, a self <br/>\nthat has largely disappeared since she left school. She was talking <br/>\nabout taking the California High School Proficiency exam &quot;to show <br/>\nthem.&quot; She began to speak in terms of setting goals that would <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;prove to everyone she was not an idiot.&quot; I tried to speak with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her about not framing her goals that way, but she was very upset and <br/>\nhurt so I backed off.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My initial reaction was to call up this Dad and have some words <br/>\n </span></blockquote>with him, but I knew my daughter would not want that so I didnt. I <br/>\nam sure this stuff is not going to end with him or with any of the <br/>\nother friends she still wants to see.

Any <br/>\nadvice/sugesstions/feedback appreciated.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Kathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi Kathryn<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh, my heart goes out to you and your daughter.  I am no expert by <br/>\nany stretch... but for whatever it&#39;s worth, I did have some <br/>\nquestions after hearing your story.  While it&#39;s hard to comment <br/>\nspecifically not knowing the cast of characters involved, or their <br/>\npersonalities and their relationships to one another, my first <br/>\nthought was --- are you on friendly, chatty terms with the father of <br/>\nyour friend? If so, has the question of homeschooling ever come up <br/>\nwith him before this incident?  Or has your daughter ever talked <br/>\nabout it with this friend (or other friends)?  I&#39;m just wondering if <br/>\nyou and perhaps even your daughter could do more to educate the <br/>\npeople in your lives... I don&#39;t mean in any way to sound like this <br/>\nwas your fault, I&#39;m just asking because it seemed odd to me that <br/>\nyour daughter&#39;s best friend would not know how great this has been <br/>\nfor her... (Although come to think of it, my son doesn&#39;t discuss it <br/>\nwith his friends.... but he&#39;s a BOY, they usually just grunt at each <br/>\nother...ha ha), or that the friend&#39;s father wouldn&#39;t notice a <br/>\npositive change in her, since it sounds like they&#39;ve gone to school <br/>\ntogether in the past. It just got me wondering... <br/>\nIn general do you feel that you have been open about homeschooling <br/>\nwith the people around you, or is there some reason why you don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel comfortable sharing it with people (afraid you&#39;ll be judged, <br/>\nnot being convinced yourself, which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, <br/>\nafraid you can&#39;t state your &quot;case&quot; well...  etc, etc?)  Maybe I just <br/>\nlive in a liberal community, but I have found that the more I <br/>\ntalk openly about how homeschooling (or unschooling if I feel <br/>\nparticularly brave) <br/>\nhas transformed my son, and how completely delighted I am that we <br/>\ndecided to do this... it usually at the very least shuts them up (as <br/>\nin the case of my father) and sometimes leads to offers of support <br/>\nand encouragement.  I even went through an hour of intense <br/>\ninquisition from the parents of one of Aaron&#39;s best friends --- <br/>\nlovely people but TOTALLY different values (their son is only <br/>\nallowed one hour a day on the computer, his time and his entire life <br/>\nare strictly orchestrated by the parents, and if he steps out of <br/>\nline... watch out!  Lots of pressure to be perfect in school...etc.  <br/>\nThere was a time when I aspired to be more like them...), and <br/>\neventually won their respect and &quot;blessing&quot; (&quot;Well, you must be <br/>\ndoing something right, because Aaron is doing great!&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to look at it is, these are people who love and care <br/>\nabout your daughter, and are sincerely worried that you and she have <br/>\ngone &quot;off the deep end&quot; in some way perhaps... So even more reason <br/>\nto reassure and educate them, to let them know that you are quite <br/>\nsure you have chosen the best path for your daughter, and that she <br/>\nis doing better than ever.  Perhaps they feel threatened... that <br/>\nthis path you have chosen somehow invalidates their more traditional <br/>\nchoice... so it doesn&#39;t hurt to let them know that this is a <br/>\npersonal choice that works for your daughter, and to avoid getting <br/>\npreachy about unschooling (which it doesn&#39;t sound like you are at <br/>\nall).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I can see that I&#39;ve rambled way too long here--- I am totally <br/>\nnew to this, and feel a bit presumptuous chiming in, but you and I <br/>\nhave similar issues, so ... just thought I&#39;d &quot;think out loud&quot; to <br/>\nyou.  Please take whatever applies and disregard what doesn&#39;t...<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\nPS:  And there&#39;s always the possibility that our friends are talking <br/>\nabout us behind our backs too... we just haven&#39;t had the misfortune <br/>\nof overhearing!  In any case, I&#39;m sure you know in your heart what&#39;s <br/>\nbest for you and your daughter-- how brave you guys are to go <br/>\nagainst the tide... That&#39;s something you can say to your daughter--- <br/>\nto reinforce what an independent and courageous thinker she is, <br/>\nrather than letting her buy into the idea that she has somehow <br/>\nfailed and therefore needs to prove something.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Need advice","postDate":"1160504734","msgId":18067,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMTAxMTI1aTUzZmJlNzdlbjM5MGQ1NjAwNzdiOTE2MjhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTAyMDA2MTUwNC4xMTIzNC40NTJCQjY5NzAwMDYxRTczMDAwMDJCRTIyMjAwNzYxMzk0OUIwRTA1MDE5RDA3MEVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDEwMTAyMDA2MTUwNC4xMTIzNC40NTJCQjY5NzAwMDYxRTczMDAwMDJCRTIyMjAwNzYxMzk0OUIwRTA1MDE5RDA3MEVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":18066,"nextInTopic":18074,"prevInTime":18066,"nextInTime":18068,"topicId":18059,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kathryn I think that it is important for your daughter to understand that his words were not about her but about homeschooling, of which he obviously has a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-77623234\">Kathryn I think that it is important for your daughter to understand<br/>\nthat his words were not about her but about homeschooling, of which he<br/>\nobviously has a biased and uninformed opinion.

Unfortunately, his opinion is shared by many people who  do not <br/>\nunderstand unschooling.  My 17 year old daughter  wanted me to  share her thoughts <br/>\nwith you as she is aware that many people don&#39;t always  &quot;get&quot; her unschooling <br/>\nlifestyle.  At 14, she was often hurt by their  opinions.  At 17, I see her <br/>\noverflowing with enthusiasm and confidence  about her life and the choices she has <br/>\nmade.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe said those things out of ignorance.  Your daughter is probably the  only <br/>\nchild he knows that unschools and he has no frame of reference to  understand <br/>\nit.  Just the fact that his daughter is in a private school  points to his <br/>\nstrong beliefs in the traditional educational system. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt might be best to just be very supportive of her strong and  understandably <br/>\nhurt feelings for a few days.  Give her some  time before trying to put some <br/>\nperspective to it.  Some things  you might discuss with her when she is ready <br/>\nmight be his uninformed opinions  due to lack of knowledge and exposure to <br/>\nother unschooling teens.  She  might not be comfortable discussing this with him, <br/>\nbut perhaps he would be open  to reading a bit about unschooling.  A great <br/>\nbook that has been recently  updated is Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Real Lives:  Eleven <br/>\nTeenagers Who Don&#39;t Go to  School Tell Their Own Stories&quot;.   It now includes <br/>\nthese young  adults eleven years later and their impressions of their <br/>\nhomeschooling  lives.  Probably not worth the recommendation, however, if he only <br/>\nequates  success as acceptance and graduation from an elite university.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy daughter&#39;s advice about taking a proficiency exam to prove something is  <br/>\nsimply &quot;Don&#39;t do it&quot; for someone else.  She may not have been out of school  <br/>\nlong enough to have the confidence to believe all that she is capable of  yet.  <br/>\nAll that she would be doing is giving credence to his &quot;incorrect&quot;  opinions.  <br/>\nAs time goes on, that confidence will come as she invests her  energies in the <br/>\nthings she loves.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSome quick thoughts.....hope they are helpful.

Let her know if you are dealing with some similar judgements.  Hey, you are in it as a fam!  My son is 16 and had a friend over the other day.  I overheard a bit of conversation that started to sound like it was a bit judgemental instead it turned into a OMG guess what I can&#39;t remember... They both ended up laughing at their shortcomings. Public or home we have a bit of a competitive streak that has to be tempered with compassion and humor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVickisue Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vickisue_gray@...\">vickisue_gray@...</a>&gt; wrote:          Wow.

It is hard to hear things<br/>\nlike that, especially since this dad was someone she<br/>\nliked, not to mention her friend too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, she shouldn&#39;t worry about what other<br/>\npeople think, she should just be herself. (I know that<br/>\nis easier said, than done.)  Why should she have to<br/>\nprove anything to anyone?  If you ask me, in my<br/>\nopinion, they are the ones that are idiots, not your<br/>\ndaughter.  I can definately understand how hurt she<br/>\nis.  I&#39;m sure it feels like one step forward, and<br/>\nabout 10 steps backward.  It&#39;s also hard, when you<br/>\nneed support, and don&#39;t have any.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think she needs some time to cool down first, and<br/>\nrealize how wrong her friend and that friends dad<br/>\nreally are.  Who are they to judge her?  In time, she<br/>\nwill see that she doesn&#39;t need to do anything to prove<br/>\nhow smart she is.  I always used to worry about my<br/>\ndaughter in school, because I find that girls are more<br/>\nvicisous than boys can be.  Hopefully your daughter<br/>\ncan find some new friends, that can accept her,<br/>\nwhether she homeschools or not.  I have read articles,<br/>\nand people have told me that homeschooled children are<br/>\nsmarter than public schooled children/private<br/>\nschooled, because they can relax, and learn at a<br/>\nbetter rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was smart to not act on impulse, and call<br/>\nthat dad.  It probably wouldn&#39;t have made a<br/>\ndifference, and might have hurt your daughter more.<br/>\n(it&#39;s hard when you go into protective mode-I&#39;ve been<br/>\nthere several times).  From the sounds of it he&#39;s not<br/>\neven worth wasting your breath on.
