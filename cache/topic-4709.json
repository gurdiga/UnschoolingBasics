I <br/>\nlove the peace I have in knowing that I could quit my job at any <br/>\ntime and we would be fine. It doesn&#39;t leave you much flexibility in <br/>\nthe homeschooling options department if you MUST work, unless you <br/>\ncan find different work that gives you some new options.<br/>\nIs it too late?<br/>\nCan you buy a different house?<br/>\nOr stay put?<br/>\nMy child&#39;s peace, safety and love of learning are FAR more important <br/>\nthan having a bigger or better house. Only you know the answer to <br/>\nthis one though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was to let your child quit school and be with you <br/>\nat work. Is there a lounge or area he could be for part of the day <br/>\nand then maybe spend the other part with your dh?<br/>\nCan you find different work? Or work from home?<br/>\nOf course you CAN, what I mean is, would you be willing to look at <br/>\nthose options?:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really want to get your child free of the system, then it&#39;s <br/>\ngoing to take a big shift in lifestyle it sounds like. There isn&#39;t <br/>\nthat much left of this school year, if you could just take him with <br/>\nyou to work, it&#39;s only a few more months.<br/>\nIf the house is the only thing standing between your child and <br/>\npeace, I think it&#39;s time to re-think priorities. That&#39;s just me <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4598,"nextTopicId":4712}}
