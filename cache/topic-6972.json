Still, I have to admit that<br/>\nunschooling is a lot more work than I would have<br/>\nthought (you have to be alert to learning<br/>\nopportunities), and like I said, with a newborn (and a<br/>\n3yo  and a part-time job as well!)

LOL For me and my kids, deschooling is a process where we start to trust our intincts again. <br/>\nAbout telling relatives....if you think they won&#39;t understand..be brief and don&#39;t even mention unschooling. Just smile and say you&#39;re homeschooling for now. <br/>\nAs far as reading...this place will keep you busy for a while! LOL Go back to the beginning and read all the threads. They&#39;re quite informative. :-)<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for my story....we decided to take our three out of school after we adopted them just to be able to spend more time with them. I kinda fell into unschooling because the alternatives were to stressful and life was stressful enough after adopting three kids. LOL<br/>\n <br/>\nStick around, read and ask questions.

My dd is 13, just finished 6th grade, and this our first <br/>\nyear unschooling.   Right now she&#39;s deschooling, not doing ANYTHING <br/>\nschoolish, healing.   She was &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD (which I was <br/>\nnever comfortable with, I only went with it hoping to get her some <br/>\nhelp in school, we never medicated, but I also continued to research <br/>\nand read), I agree with what Robyn wrote below, about many of <br/>\nthe &quot;disabilites&quot; being caused by being in school.   My dd is very <br/>\ncapable and intelligent, but it didn&#39;t &quot;show&quot; in her grades (which I <br/>\nnever worried about - I researched homeschooling for over 2 years, <br/>\nand found unschooling in the process).   She, too was bored in <br/>\nschool, so I can understand what your son is saying.   I also believe <br/>\nit&#39;s my daughter&#39;s learning style that doesn&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; with the way <br/>\nthey teach in school, which is mostly sequential.   She&#39;s a <br/>\nvisual/spatial learner, a &quot;picture thinker&quot;.  She can&#39;t learn words <br/>\nphonetically, but once she sees it or makes a picture of it in her <br/>\nmind, it&#39;s permanent.   It can look a lot like ADHD (I can tell you <br/>\nmore if you&#39;re interested, you can email me off list, since I have a <br/>\nchild who was diagnosed with ADHD and we&#39;re a family who pulled a <br/>\nchild from school and are now unschooling).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Your experiences too...how did you decide (for those of you who <br/>\n </span></blockquote>started with PS and then went to unschooling)? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n (see above!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Many of us have come to the belief that many diagnoses of ADHD/ODD <br/>\n </span></blockquote>are actually caused by being in school.
