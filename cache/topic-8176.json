My son (12 yrs)  interrupted our dinner conversation to tell us that he <br/>\nwanted to start playing guitar.  His eyes were wild and gleaming with excitement.  We had <br/>\njust enjoyed the serenades of a Mexican musical group and were celebrating our wedding <br/>\nanniversary at a favorite local restaurant.  I had NO idea that the three men playing guitars <br/>\nhad inspried my son so much.  Since leaving school in February I have seen little interest on <br/>\nhis part in anything at all.  All I could do was have faith in him and watch and listen to him.  <br/>\nNow we have returned home and he wants to know immediately when he can start lessons <br/>\nand where he can get a guitar!  Well, tomorrow morning as soon as we can get up and get out <br/>\nthe door!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe might not like guitar.  He might like it a lot and learn how to play lots of great music.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t care which way it goes.  I&#39;m just happy that he is finally excited about something and <br/>\nthat he felt free to ask for it!!  I think I&#39;m happy too because I&#39;m seeing the first awakening.  <br/>\nOxegynation!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to all,<br/>\nabrazos, Ahna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8178,"nextTopicId":8110}}
