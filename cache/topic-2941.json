Young children he said,  could not tell whether they<br/>\nwere cold or not  .At the time I thought, mmm, sounds reasonable.  But when<br/>\nI had a child and saw daily how he feels things exquisitely, I had to say,<br/>\nHUNH?  Why wouldn&#39;t he be able to feel the cold of the air on his body as<br/>\nwell as bumping his toe. Well obviously he can so when he got old enough to<br/>\nhave a preference, I followed that.  He&#39;s a little steam engine and stays<br/>\nvery long while I&#39;m bundling up, shivering.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2939,"nextTopicId":2942}}
