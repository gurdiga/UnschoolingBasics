I know that for me, there&#39;s a fine balance <br/>\nbetween &#39;a nice cuppa&#39; and jitters and sleepy - yup sleepy - one cup <br/>\nis good, two cups is sleepy, three cups is edgy - whether it&#39;s coffee <br/>\nor soda or tea. At most festive gatherings, I&#39;ll have a small <br/>\ncaffeinated item early on then switch to something like ginger ale or <br/>\nSprite or root beer (except Barq&#39;s which adds caffeine for the &#39;bite&#39;) <br/>\n(major preference given to raspberry ginger ale). Mostly what I do at <br/>\nwork is mocha - instant cocoa, a splash of cream, and fill with coffee <br/>\n(decaf, hazelnut, whatever is fresh in the kitchen here) instead of <br/>\nhot water.
