She does not particularly enjoy reading because she has to<br/>\nconstantly stop and ask me about particular words.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, it really doesn&#39;t matter if a child is at a<br/>\ncompletely different level than another was at any age. My perception<br/>\nis that the ability to read only distracts from opportunities to do<br/>\nother equally valid activities. I don&#39;t believe that there is a lost<br/>\nopportunity for a child not to be able to read, until they are seeking<br/>\nto do so. For instance, our son learns though observation, auditory<br/>\nintake of information and memory/recall, instead of relying on the<br/>\nwritten word for storing or exchanging information. The ability to<br/>\nenjoy a (non)/fiction story is not limited to the written word, of<br/>\ncourse. In fact, I don&#39;t believe that the written word has greater<br/>\nvalue than storytelling or media representation of (non)/fiction. It<br/>\nis just a different tool of conveying information. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability to sound out words, is discrete from the ability to<br/>\nrecognize meanings of words. The theory is that a person has exposure<br/>\nto a larger vocabulary through the written word than through verbal<br/>\noratory. I guess that depends on if one is &#39;stoping to constantly ask<br/>\nabout particular words&#39;, or not. Our son deduces meaning from context<br/>\nindependently anyway, or occasionally he asks about a new word. So, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t see the merit of reading &#39;earlier&#39; especially if one &#39;does not<br/>\nparticularly enjoy reading&#39;, for whatever reason. When reading serves<br/>\nits own value and enjoyment, there are many tools of enriching that<br/>\ninterest, beyond the use of a structured lesson since learning happens<br/>\nall the time. Symbolic representation of meaning with words exists<br/>\neverywhere; one doensn&#39;t need to read a phonics lesson to deduce how<br/>\nletters are related to sounds. Our son just spontaneously pops out<br/>\nwith &#39;mama, boy starts with the b-sound&#39;. He wasn&#39;t taught that, he<br/>\nfigured it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully, <br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Phonics, Learning to Read, Intro","postDate":"1161289769","msgId":18461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMTkxMzI5aDZhZGMwNDcweTdhZWU0NTliZmViNGUyZjFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTIwMWM2ZjM3NiRhYTBiMzZmMCQ4MmVhZmM0NUB5b3VyNmtyNHp4bGQ5MD4=","referencesHeader":"PGVoNm5vMCtnNTR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDAwMTIwMWM2ZjM3NiRhYTBiMzZmMCQ4MmVhZmM0NUB5b3VyNmtyNHp4bGQ5MD4="},"prevInTopic":18451,"nextInTopic":18469,"prevInTime":18460,"nextInTime":18462,"topicId":18449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... encounter in day to day life.

Of course not, but just being able to pronounce them in his mind encourages him to look for meaning in the context.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to my 7 year old daughter whose phonics instruction was interrupted when we made the bizarre decision to send her to first grade.  There she faced a room with labels on many objects and lists of sight words to memorize.  Her reading is at a completely different level than her brother&#39;s was at her age.  She does not particularly enjoy reading because she has to constantly stop and ask me about particular words.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they are definitely very different learners, I am convinced that resuming phonics instruction with her will make a big difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only recently begun to consider unschooling and my philosophy on reading is obviously not very unschoolingish, but perhaps some of you will consider my ideas as I have been considering yours for the last few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele T<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18359,"nextTopicId":14885}}
