Actually, it is the only time anybody REALLY <br/>\nlearns in a useful way - because if they learn out of context, they <br/>\noften never develop the ability to know when to use the practiced <br/>\ntechnique.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told a bunch of times about how Roxana learned to do long division <br/>\nbecause it is such a good example of an unschooled kid/mom interaction <br/>\nregarding math. She wanted to travel to New York, around 3,000 miles <br/>\naway, and wanted to know how long it would take us to drive there, so <br/>\nshe asked me how many miles we could travel in a day. I just said, &quot;Oh <br/>\naround 350 miles per day, probably.&quot; She proceeded to subtract 350 from <br/>\n3,000 over and over, to figure out how many 350&#39;s there were in 3,000. <br/>\nI walked by and saw what she was doing and that she was frustrated, <br/>\nbecause she&#39;d made a mistake in her subtraction early on and had just <br/>\nnoticed it, and I said, &quot;There is an easier way to do that.&quot; She was <br/>\neager to learn the easier way, and I told her that she had to be a <br/>\nlittle patient and let me show her some simpler ones first, but that <br/>\npretty quickly she&#39;d be able to do the harder kind she wanted to do. So <br/>\nI showed her 6 divided by 3 and then 60 divided by 3 and then 60 <br/>\ndivided by 30 and then 600 divided by 30 and then 600 divided by 15 and <br/>\nthen some with remainders. Then I said, &quot;Okay, you can do the one you <br/>\nwanted to now.&quot; She was SO excited - this was a short-cut she could <br/>\nreally appreciate. I told her, &quot;This is called long division.&quot; Her <br/>\nresponse: &quot;Wow, but this is so cool. Why do people always groan and act <br/>\nlike they hate long division?&quot;  And she had me give her about 10 more <br/>\nbig long problems to play with. She did those and that was it. Her one <br/>\nand only ever &quot;lesson&quot; on long division and it lasted about 30 minutes <br/>\ntotal, including her extra practice time at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling math doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids frustrated by not knowing <br/>\nbasic arithmetic like multiplication and division. It means that they <br/>\nlearn them because they want to learn them and very often they simply <br/>\npick them up the same way they picked up reading and writing. This was <br/>\none time that the need was very apparent and the response was for me to <br/>\nquickly help her learn what she wanted to know. But, keep in mind, <br/>\nshe&#39;s never had one single minute of being required to do any math <br/>\n(she&#39;s 17 now) and she&#39;s perfectly adept at basic arithmetic and has <br/>\ngood conceptual understanding of all kinds of math concepts that she <br/>\nprobably couldn&#39;t even name. She&#39;s been talking about wanting to do <br/>\nsome algebra - she&#39;s thinking about college requirements at this point <br/>\nand is going to want to take the math placement test at the college at <br/>\nsome point, and hopes to not have to start at the very beginning of the <br/>\ncollege math sequence - so I bought some algebra books that I thought <br/>\nshe might find to her liking. She fooled with them a little bit and now <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been sitting around for a couple of months. I think that is <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s been very busy - doing two shows and writing a novel and <br/>\ntaking musical theater related classes. It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not even <br/>\nreminding her about the algebra books, because she knows they are there <br/>\nand she could work with them if that&#39;s what she wanted. Maybe when <br/>\nshe&#39;s less busy, I&#39;ll ask her if she wants to go back to them with my <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t put that on them.

Not<br/>\neveryone, especially those new to it understand. <br/>\nPeople all the time think it&#39;s that crazy thing lazy<br/>\nparents do where there kids don&#39;t do anything but<br/>\nwathc tv all day and run wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that&#39;s not the case.  We trust our children to<br/>\nlearn and are very involved.  We don&#39;t set arbitrary<br/>\nrules about school or what time it should be done.  By<br/>\nthe way my kids do their best in the morning and I<br/>\nwrote about the math more in antoher post.  We let<br/>\nthem learn and discover and if the want to spend all<br/>\nday reading and looking up info on the internet about<br/>\nmummies or trains or whatever, we don&#39;t interrupt and<br/>\nsay they have to do language now.  We don&#39;t saysay<br/>\nthey have to read this book or write a report, but<br/>\nthrill when they choose things like that on their own.<br/>\n When they want to learn something but don&#39;t know, we<br/>\nhelp them discover how. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am definately not recommending (I have hardest time<br/>\nspelling this word LOL!) stomping on feelings and what<br/>\nparent truly thinks kids need no restrictions in life.<br/>\n I am not forcing my kids to learn.  They learn on<br/>\ntheir own.  They are proud of their efforts and<br/>\naccomplishments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do trust my children to learn, but also recognize<br/>\nthey are children and need some guidance.  I do not<br/>\nthink unschoolers raise uncaring children, nor do I<br/>\nthink they are uninvolved.  I believe they are the<br/>\nmost involved with their children.  That was my point.<br/>\n Being involved is necessary.  I know the people on<br/>\nthis list must be and tried to explain that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are not at the tender mercies of a math<br/>\ncurriculum.  It is a resource they are welcome to use<br/>\nand they like it.  I have not subjected them to<br/>\ncritical scrutiny either.  I can&#39;t understand why you<br/>\nseem so angry and presume such bad things about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very familiar with unschoolingand have been for<br/>\nyears, though only on this list for few months.  And I<br/>\nknow guidance isn&#39;t Mom making all the descisions, and<br/>\nI don&#39;t, but it is making some of them.  My kids are<br/>\nkids and can&#39;t make all the descisions either.  I also<br/>\nassumed unschoolers gave that to their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad you have children who are helpful.  Mine are<br/>\nalso, but won&#39;t lift a finger if Mom doesn&#39;t require<br/>\nit.  I don&#39;t focus on their deficiencies, but<br/>\nrecognize their weaknesses and help them strengthen<br/>\nthose areas. I haven&#39;t defined what they need to<br/>\nlearn.  They choose what to learn.  They want to learn<br/>\nmath.  I help them, but they can do it how they<br/>\nchoose.  They don&#39;t always use Math-U-See (which isn&#39;t<br/>\na text book).<br/>\n<br/>\nRules are not bad and I have the courage to live<br/>\naccording to my principles.  I am not fearful.  As<br/>\nsomeone who chooses homebirth, breastfeeding,<br/>\nunschooling (or relaxed homeschooling, if you prefer),<br/>\nattachment parenting, and being a Christian who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t approve of President Bush all put me out of<br/>\nthe mainstream.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have made a point though.

Her pride is in what she has accomplished<br/>\n&gt; &quot;academically&quot;, not from<br/>\n&gt; making her mother happy or approving.

It is never<br/>\n&gt; &quot;leaving them to their own devices&quot; but the<br/>\n&gt; opposite. We don&#39;t leave them to<br/>\n&gt; the tender mercies of some horrible math curriculum<br/>\n&gt; either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Read for longer. Learn how it works before<br/>\n&gt; offensively dismissing us as not<br/>\n&gt; caring if our kids grow up to be caring and<br/>\n&gt; responsible. Hopefully you will<br/>\n&gt; also gain more faith in your children, instead of<br/>\n&gt; the amount of critical<br/>\n&gt; scrutiny they have been subjected to by you in your<br/>\n&gt; post.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They can&#39;t get the<br/>\n&gt; education they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>\n&gt; have shown it&#39;s not healthy).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Studies on schooled children. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many, possibly most, Unschooled children watch all<br/>\n&gt; the tv they want, but<br/>\n&gt; no-one thinks they are getting *all* the education<br/>\n&gt; they need from it -<br/>\n&gt; including the children themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And making them happy<br/>\n&gt; all the time isn&#39;t my job.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Helping Jayn find her joy as much as possible in the<br/>\n&gt; world is my job - my<br/>\n&gt; best job.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They need and want guidance.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are defining guidance as Mom makes all the<br/>\n&gt; choices that matter, and<br/>\n&gt; enforce compliance if they disagree. Why are you<br/>\n&gt; assuming that Unschoolers<br/>\n&gt; are not giving guidance to their children?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course you are free to call yourself what you<br/>\n&gt; want in real life, although<br/>\n&gt; I would call it &quot;Relaxed Homeschooling&quot; for<br/>\n&gt; accuracy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But on this list, as we discuss Unschooling, no you<br/>\n&gt; are *not*. You stopped<br/>\n&gt; being one when you started requiring a certain<br/>\n&gt; amount of math over your<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s stated objections because you stopped<br/>\n&gt; trusting them to learn it<br/>\n&gt; in their own time and their own way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They choose most of their<br/>\n&gt; learning experiences and always their education is<br/>\n&gt; tailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>\n&gt; lesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>\n&gt; use workbooks if they want to and then not every<br/>\n&gt; page<br/>\n&gt; or problem must be done, just what they need to<br/>\n&gt; learn.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, I require my kids to do math every<br/>\n&gt; day. <br/>\n&gt; We have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>\n&gt; flash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>\n&gt; something.  I also make them do math first.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well which is it then?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No lesson plan except for do math first.<br/>\n&gt; No checklists except for they have to do something<br/>\n&gt; math before they can<br/>\n&gt; play.<br/>\n&gt; No textbooks except for Math-U-See, whatever that<br/>\n&gt; is.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What really stops you being an Unschooler is that<br/>\n&gt; *you* are the one defining<br/>\n&gt; &quot;just what they need to learn&quot; instead of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They also do a fair amount of helping around<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; house and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; any<br/>\n&gt; choice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>\n&gt; or provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>\n&gt; parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are so far from really unschooling just the<br/>\n&gt; basic &quot;academic portion&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; that any discussion of Whole Life Unschooling is<br/>\n&gt; beyond consideration. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You are so focused on your children&#39;s deficiencies<br/>\n&gt; and how you have to make<br/>\n&gt; them do stuff to make them up, that it is no wonder<br/>\n&gt; you can&#39;t trust them to<br/>\n&gt; want to help you around the house. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jayn is never forced to do anything around the<br/>\n&gt; house. The result is a<br/>\n&gt; constant willing helper. Last night my precious,<br/>\n&gt; smart, vivacious 5 yo with<br/>\n&gt; no assigned chores, came joyfully in to tell me she<br/>\n&gt; had a surprise for me.<br/>\n&gt; She proudly displayed how she had carefully removed<br/>\n&gt; from the packaging and<br/>\n&gt; put away into the refrigerator all of her juice<br/>\n&gt; boxes, recently brought home<br/>\n&gt; from the store.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it is fear and distrust that prompts the<br/>\n&gt; setting of the kind of<br/>\n&gt; parental comfort limits you are talking about.<br/>\n&gt; Living in freedom with<br/>\n&gt; consensus and mindfulness and Principles instead of<br/>\n&gt; rules takes courage and<br/>\n&gt; commitment, just as much as any choice to move out<br/>\n&gt; of the mainstream.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robyn L.

I live with my dh and 2 dds in New Zealand. Since <br/>\nFeb this year I have home schooled my 5.5yo dd after she hated every <br/>\nday of the less than 2 weeks she attended school. I have been an <br/>\nattachment parent with both my dd (my older dd is 14yo) and so I took <br/>\nthe (then) very scary step of taking her out. At the time I was also <br/>\nreading John Holt&#39;s How children learn.<br/>\nI then spent months of worrying, &#39;what have I done&#39; type thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started out copying school as I had no idea what else to do. I cringe <br/>\nwhen  I look back now and feel so sorry for my dd. Yet I still find it <br/>\nso difficult to let go completely. There are 13 hs fam in our town and <br/>\nall of them use curriculum. The school bit I still make my daughter do <br/>\nis some hand printing, a &#39;story&#39; one line sentence and she reads a <br/>\nreader to me. Even though it doesn&#39;t take her very long to do that, she <br/>\nstill doesn&#39;t want to do them. I&#39;m getting tired of pushing her and so <br/>\nhere we are: finally I&#39;m looking at unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat stops me from just letting her do what she wants is this: as there <br/>\nis a big age gap between my dd, my dd has no sibling to play with. We <br/>\nwere overseas for a year last year and some of her friends moved away <br/>\nand we still trying to find more friends for her. After these 9 month <br/>\nat home she has recently started to complain a lot about wanting to <br/>\nplay with friends more and about being bored on her own.<br/>\nI can relate to  that very well. My brothers were 8 and 12 yrs older <br/>\ntoo. With the kids from the hs group and the kids she knows from <br/>\nschool, she still spends too much time on her own, IMO and hers. So if <br/>\nshe needs to go to school for being with kids, she needs to know a bit <br/>\nto fit back in.<br/>\nThen I&#39;m not sure if I can keep up hs her. It is exhausting at times to <br/>\nbe the Mum, playmate, bookreader , taxi driver etc 7 days a week. That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I constantly entertain her. She spends many more hours <br/>\nplaying by herself.  We are both happier when she has a friend over. <br/>\nThen she is engaged playing and I can happily do my stuff, knowing she <br/>\nis happy, too. Lacking that, I take her places, swimming etc to break <br/>\nup a long afternoon etc. She also attends ballet, girl guides and <br/>\nSuzuki violin and that takes a bit of running around too, so that I <br/>\nfeel there is little time to catch up on my jobs.<br/>\nSo I&#39;m doing the &#39;basics&#39; as a sort of insurance for the &#39;what if&#39; <br/>\nscenario.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how it is for other unschoolers with just one child at home.<br/>\nI wonder if I dropped making her do the schooly bits if she would want <br/>\nto read and write soon? (If she could read herself, a world of books <br/>\nwould be avail to her all day long = less need for other kids).<br/>\nGreetings from down under<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Just when I thought......","postDate":"1099996837","msgId":3960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRjY2Nzg4LTMyM0ItMTFEOS1BRUE5LTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzUwMWM0YzYyZiQyYTk5MDM1MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxMzUwMWM0YzYyZiQyYTk5MDM1MCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":3959,"nextInTopic":3961,"prevInTime":3959,"nextInTime":3961,"topicId":3938,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

This is not the place to forget about schooling<br/>\nor unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I only let my kids watch TV or videos/DVDs and play<br/>\non the computer during late afternoon and evening. <br/>\nI&#39;m not so rigid that I don&#39;t make exceptions,<br/>\nespecially for stuff that has to do with what they are<br/>\ninterested in learning, but it holds true for most the<br/>\ntime.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They have freedom in how to learn something and even<br/>\nabout when to go play for the most part.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for doing math first. Or learning using computer games. Or from<br/>\nDVD&#39;s. Or from playing. Or evidently from math in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are morning people. They learn best first thing after awakening.<br/>\nOthers need to warm up to the day, and are at their most productive in the<br/>\nafternoon or evening hours. These time restrictions are arbitrary.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They never do when left on their own, but admit it&#39;s okay<br/>\nwhen I make them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>\nare very proud of themselves for what they have<br/>\nlearned.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may believe it&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s not Unschooling. It&#39;s not OK to recommend<br/>\nrestrictions and enforced teaching or stomping over your children&#39;s feelings<br/>\nuntil they are defeated, on an Unschooling list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy child is proud of herself too, and she has never been forced to &quot;learn&quot;<br/>\nanything. Her pride is in what she has accomplished &quot;academically&quot;, not from<br/>\nmaking her mother happy or approving. Of course I am both of those things.<br/>\nEspecially since it is all her own ideas and discoveries.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Mine is to<br/>\nhelp my kids become educated and grow into<br/>\nresponsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>\nleave them to their own devices.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne purpose of this list is to help parents trust that their children will<br/>\nlearn all that need to become caring and responsible adults. It is never<br/>\n&quot;leaving them to their own devices&quot; but the opposite. We don&#39;t leave them to<br/>\nthe tender mercies of some horrible math curriculum either.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead for longer. Learn how it works before offensively dismissing us as not<br/>\ncaring if our kids grow up to be caring and responsible. Hopefully you will<br/>\nalso gain more faith in your children, instead of the amount of critical<br/>\nscrutiny they have been subjected to by you in your post.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They can&#39;t get the<br/>\neducation they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>\nhave shown it&#39;s not healthy).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStudies on schooled children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany, possibly most, Unschooled children watch all the tv they want, but<br/>\nno-one thinks they are getting *all* the education they need from it -<br/>\nincluding the children themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And making them happy<br/>\nall the time isn&#39;t my job.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping Jayn find her joy as much as possible in the world is my job - my<br/>\nbest job.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They need and want guidance.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are defining guidance as Mom makes all the choices that matter, and<br/>\nenforce compliance if they disagree. Why are you assuming that Unschoolers<br/>\nare not giving guidance to their children?  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you are free to call yourself what you want in real life, although<br/>\nI would call it &quot;Relaxed Homeschooling&quot; for accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut on this list, as we discuss Unschooling, no you are *not*. You stopped<br/>\nbeing one when you started requiring a certain amount of math over your<br/>\nchildren&#39;s stated objections because you stopped trusting them to learn it<br/>\nin their own time and their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They choose most of their<br/>\nlearning experiences and always their education is<br/>\ntailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>\nlesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>\nuse workbooks if they want to and then not every page<br/>\nor problem must be done, just what they need to learn.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, I require my kids to do math every day. <br/>\nWe have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>\nflash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>\nsomething.  I also make them do math first.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell which is it then?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo lesson plan except for do math first.<br/>\nNo checklists except for they have to do something math before they can<br/>\nplay.<br/>\nNo textbooks except for Math-U-See, whatever that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really stops you being an Unschooler is that *you* are the one defining<br/>\n&quot;just what they need to learn&quot; instead of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; They also do a fair amount of helping around the<br/>\nhouse and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have any<br/>\nchoice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>\nor provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>\nparent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are so far from really unschooling just the basic &quot;academic portion&quot;,<br/>\nthat any discussion of Whole Life Unschooling is beyond consideration. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are so focused on your children&#39;s deficiencies and how you have to make<br/>\nthem do stuff to make them up, that it is no wonder you can&#39;t trust them to<br/>\nwant to help you around the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is never forced to do anything around the house. The result is a<br/>\nconstant willing helper. Last night my precious, smart, vivacious 5 yo with<br/>\nno assigned chores, came joyfully in to tell me she had a surprise for me.<br/>\nShe proudly displayed how she had carefully removed from the packaging and<br/>\nput away into the refrigerator all of her juice boxes, recently brought home<br/>\nfrom the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is fear and distrust that prompts the setting of the kind of<br/>\nparental comfort limits you are talking about. Living in freedom with<br/>\nconsensus and mindfulness and Principles instead of rules takes courage and<br/>\ncommitment, just as much as any choice to move out of the mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I<br/>\nremembered that as their mother I can parent them,<br/>\nwhich includes guiding and directing their activities.<br/>\n They have freedom in how to learn something and even<br/>\nabout when to go play for the most part.   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I require my kids to do math every day. <br/>\nWe have Math-U-See and they can do a page in it or<br/>\nflash cards or something else.  But they have to do<br/>\nsomething.  I also make them do math first.  They<br/>\nnever do when left on their own, but admit it&#39;s okay<br/>\nwhen I make them.  They put up a fuss at first, but<br/>\nare very proud of themselves for what they have<br/>\nlearned.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about schooling or unschooling, if that<br/>\nconfuses you, but think about your goal.  Mine is to<br/>\nhelp my kids become educated and grow into<br/>\nresponsible, caring adults.  They won&#39;t do that if I<br/>\nleave them to their own devices.  They can&#39;t get the<br/>\neducation they need watching tv all day (and studies<br/>\nhave shown it&#39;s not healthy).  And making them happy<br/>\nall the time isn&#39;t my job.  They need and want<br/>\nguidance.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still &quot;unschooling.&quot;  They choose most of their<br/>\nlearning experiences and always their education is<br/>\ntailored to the way they learn best.  We have no<br/>\nlesson plans or checklists or textbooks.  They only<br/>\nuse workbooks if they want to and then not every page<br/>\nor problem must be done, just what they need to learn.<br/>\n They also do a fair amount of helping around the<br/>\nhouse and with the little ones and they don&#39;t have any<br/>\nchoice about that.  So don&#39;t be afraid to set limits<br/>\nor provide more direct guidance.  It&#39;s your job as<br/>\nparent.  I hope this helps.  I&#39;ve been where you are. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChrista<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Syndi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:justlikemama@...\">justlikemama@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;   Ok, Just when I thought I had this all figured out<br/>\n&gt; and was secure <br/>\n&gt; in what we are doing as far as radical unschooling I<br/>\n&gt; find myself very <br/>\n&gt; insecure and now, after reading a post from the<br/>\n&gt; other unschooling <br/>\n&gt; list mentioned, its even worse!<br/>\n&gt;   1st off is the TV.  I don&#39;t monitor it at all, but<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t have <br/>\n&gt; cable so its not like there is too much my boyz<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t watch.  BUT, <br/>\n&gt; the thing is on constantly.  Its as if my oldest<br/>\n&gt; cannot funtion <br/>\n&gt; without hearing or seeing it!  Even if it is to put<br/>\n&gt; on a pair of <br/>\n&gt; shoes, he goes right to the tv to sit down and do<br/>\n&gt; it.  Am I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; wrong leaving it on all the time?  Myself, I like to<br/>\n&gt; listen to it, so <br/>\n&gt; I have been assuming that is what my kids are doing<br/>\n&gt; too.  I guess I <br/>\n&gt; am just second guessing myself again.  <br/>\n&gt;   I need to get back to reading this list everyday,<br/>\n&gt; when I do, It is <br/>\n&gt; so much easier to keep things in perspective!<br/>\n&gt;   Ok, 2nd, on the other list, which I found to have<br/>\n&gt; some great things <br/>\n&gt; to read, someone mentioned that she doesn&#39;t just<br/>\n&gt; leave her kids to <br/>\n&gt; themselves.  But my boys seem to be so busy during<br/>\n&gt; the day, that they <br/>\n&gt; usually don&#39;t have time for mom!  So I&#39;ve just been<br/>\n&gt; letting them do <br/>\n&gt; their thing, as this is when they seem their<br/>\n&gt; happiest and most <br/>\n&gt; content.  The youngest loves to read before bed, but<br/>\n&gt; so far that is <br/>\n&gt; ALL he wants to do with mom.  The comment I read<br/>\n&gt; from that list that <br/>\n&gt; got me thinking was, she doesn&#39;t just let the kids<br/>\n&gt; play vidio games <br/>\n&gt; and watch tv and play all day.  OH my , this is<br/>\n&gt; exactly what my kids <br/>\n&gt; are doing!  <br/>\n&gt;   I do take them  to the library , when I can get<br/>\n&gt; them to, never <br/>\n&gt; forcing it.  I let them pick out their own books,<br/>\n&gt; but don&#39;t stress <br/>\n&gt; over weather or not they read them.  We go to the<br/>\n&gt; park, weather and <br/>\n&gt; asthma permitting, they go outdoors, and I do<br/>\n&gt; &quot;strew&quot; things about, <br/>\n&gt; but most times its ignored.  <br/>\n&gt;   Should I be doing anything any different?  I think<br/>\n&gt; my own schooling <br/>\n&gt; is trying to creep back into my head, I don&#39;t know,<br/>\n&gt; I just all the <br/>\n&gt; sudden have all these doubts!<br/>\n&gt;   Thanks for listening<br/>\n&gt; syndi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nCheck out the new Yahoo!

When I <br/>\nworked before and the oldest was in school, most days I couldn&#39;t wait <br/>\nto get them to bed, or out the door, or to gr&#39;mas.  Now, its so much <br/>\ndifferent, I love being around them, and having them home, and <br/>\nsending them to gr&#39;mas is not top priority anymore!<br/>\n  I guess what I fear would be the future.  I just finished the <br/>\nUnprocessed Child (WONDERFUL BOOK!) I might have to get it out and <br/>\nread it again!<br/>\n  Now sitting here thinking about all this I realize I am in fact <br/>\ncomparing my youngest to what the rest of the kids in school are <br/>\ndoing.  He has no interest in any of it, so like I said, we just read <br/>\nfor now.  (and read, and read, and READ!)  But it creeps in, they are <br/>\ndoing math, on worksheets, mine is doing math in his head, without <br/>\ninstruction.  Oh i could go on and on.  But you see what I mean and <br/>\nyes, i can see exactly what you are talking about.  They are where <br/>\nthey need to be.  <br/>\n  I had to throw in the math part for those that are considering or <br/>\nare new to unschooling.  My youngest is 6 and it was totally amazing <br/>\nto me that he was adding and subtracting without doing worksheet <br/>\nafter worksheet or any instruction. In fact, it was by accident that <br/>\nI found out he was capable of this. Not to mention his vocabulary.  <br/>\nMust be all the tv, new words all the time popping out of his little <br/>\nhead! NOT that I&#39;m comparing him to the kids in school &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n  Ok, gotta get back on track and back to reading.

I <br/>\nencourage them to arm themselves with good information and  find out why they are <br/>\nhaving the doubts exactly.  What are they afraid  of?  <br/>\n <br/>\nAre you afraid that these other children, with mom&#39;s that won&#39;t let them  <br/>\nwatch TV all day, will be ahead of your children, happier than your children,  <br/>\nmore connected to family than your children?  What is it exactly?   Once you <br/>\ndefine the origin of your fear it is easier to regroup.  Try  getting rid of all <br/>\nthat self-talk going on in your head that you learned from  society, from your <br/>\nfamily or from years of schooling.  Start replacing that  with things like <br/>\n&quot;my children are exactly where they need to be in life&quot;   &quot;they are happy&quot; <br/>\n&quot;there is no one to be behind and no one to catch up to, they  are on their own <br/>\npath&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou cannot compare your children to anyone else&#39;s.  They are as  connected to <br/>\nyou as they need to be.  If you are open and available, they  know that.  <br/>\nMaybe that is why they are so secure in not being physically  doing things with <br/>\nyou all day, they know you are there when they need or want  you.  They are <br/>\nspiritually connected.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes I will go up to my boys, who sound a lot like yours in that  they <br/>\nare busy with their own interests, and say that I just need a hug. Or I  will <br/>\npass by and whisper in their ear &quot;I love you&quot;.  We also do not need to  be <br/>\ndoing things with each other all day.  They also see me involved with my  <br/>\ninterests as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nReread some of you favorite unschooling books, one of mine that I reread is  <br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s The Unprocessed Child.
