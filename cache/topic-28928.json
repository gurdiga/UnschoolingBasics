HA!   <br/>\nI have a 12 yr old daughter with autism and a 6 yr old son who has<br/>\nsensory issues (probably on the spectrum also but we don&#39;t feel a need<br/>\nfor a dx at this point)  They are both intense, rigid and clash like<br/>\noil and water whenever they try to do anything together (like live ,<br/>\neat at the same table , breath the same air... inhabit the same<br/>\nplanet!)    <br/>\nI do have times when I just have to send them away from each other<br/>\nbecause one is really riding roughshod over the other and because of<br/>\ntheir issues they often can&#39;t disengage without the suggestion.   Our<br/>\ntherapist has been working with our daughter on role playing ways to<br/>\nwork out things, remove herself from the situation and knowing which<br/>\nto do when etc.   My son is so intense and so set on something turning<br/>\nout in his hands exactly as his mind imagined it that he is often<br/>\noverwhelmed and frustrated.    It&#39;s easy to lose your temper and flare<br/>\nback at them but I am sure you have noticed it just inflames the<br/>\nsituation!    I try to remain calm and agree that I understand they<br/>\nare upset and/or frustrated, I try to get him to show me or explain to<br/>\nme what he is trying to accomplish... sometimes I offer suggestions<br/>\n(usually offering several is more helpful because they really don&#39;t<br/>\nappreciate being told what to do ... they don&#39;t mind help but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t like edicts)  sometimes just having me verbally trouble shoot<br/>\nhelps him because he has a bit of a word retrieval issue and it&#39;s hard<br/>\nfor him to explain to me where his brain is going with something.   My<br/>\ndaughter really needs to feel heard and to have as much control over<br/>\nher environment as is comfortable for the rest of us.   Her autism has<br/>\nprovided some pretty awesome gifts ... we try to allow them to<br/>\nflourish even if it makes life at our house disorderly (think<br/>\nthousands of half used sheets of drawing paper swirling around her<br/>\nroom and various other parts of the house)   <br/>\nThere are times when I suggest to one or the other of them that maybe<br/>\ntaking a break would help them come back fresh to the situation and be<br/>\nable to approach it with fresh eyes.    Sometimes I tell them I am<br/>\nfrustrated and need to take a break and will come back to help them in<br/>\na few minutes.    I think that when you are dealing with kids that are<br/>\nfrustrated it&#39;s so important to show them good coping skills...<br/>\nimagine them as adults and thinking it&#39;s ok to hit or yell because<br/>\nthey are frustrated with someone.    I would much rather see my<br/>\nchildren as adults who can remove themselves from a heated situation<br/>\nand return when they are able to be cool and respectful and agree or<br/>\ndisagree in a civil manner.  I know that my children get their<br/>\nintensity in part from me...I try to remember that so I understand<br/>\nthat and respect that rather than seeing it as something to be fixed.<br/>\n  Sometimes its a trait in myself that I don&#39;t like much so I really<br/>\nhave to consciously put a positive spin on it!   Another thing you may<br/>\nalready know but with intense kids they often have a need for deep<br/>\npressure/crashing type movements... I find that just sort of wrapping<br/>\nmy arms around him (not an actual hug because he may not be able to<br/>\nallow that at that moment) and holding him firmly calms his sensory<br/>\nsystem and reorients his brain from sending off flares.  Also speaking<br/>\nquietly can sometimes help them bring it down a few notches as well.    <br/>\nOne thing that sends my son over the edge is when I think I will just<br/>\ntake something from his hands and fix it to make his life easier...OH<br/>\nBOY does that make him crazy... it just steals his power and makes him<br/>\nmiserable!   For me this is one of the things that was a light bulb<br/>\nmoment of why taking away artificial limits, rules and giving him<br/>\nfreedom makes so much sense.  Making another person powerless is the<br/>\nworst sort of prison! <br/>\nLisa Blocker     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michelle Thedaker&quot;<br/>\n&lt;pamperedthed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping for some thought sharing on the topic of child<br/>\n </span></blockquote>frustration, i.e.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a child who is easily frustrated and gets amped up very quickly and<br/>\n&gt; intensely.

I have an Aspie boy who has inflexible thinking, so <br/>\nyes, I know of what you speak.  I try to encourage him to think <br/>\noutside the box at times when he is relaxed and we are not dealing <br/>\nwith some major issue.  RDI has helped with that too.  The problem <br/>\nis, as I see it, that they have a picture of how something should be, <br/>\nand when it&#39;s not that way, it&#39;s hard for them to make sense of it.  <br/>\nASD kids do tend to feel things on a much more intense level than <br/>\nmost people, so it&#39;s a real struggle for them to find balance.<br/>\nI always try to keep that in mind, and it helps me to remember that <br/>\nhe&#39;s doing his best at all times to cope with his world.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could maybe start working on this with an activity in which you <br/>\nlead, so they are looking to you for guidance.  Could be cooking, <br/>\ngardening, making a craft.  If they are unfamiliar with something, <br/>\nthey will need some guidance, and be less likely to have already <br/>\nformed a picture of what the activity or project is supposed to look <br/>\nlike.  Do this when you have lots of time, so they don&#39;t feel <br/>\npressured to finish something quickly and make your movements slow.  <br/>\nThis always helps my boy.  <br/>\nHTH<br/>\n<br/>\ndory<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michelle Thedaker&quot; <br/>\n&lt;pamperedthed@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping for some thought sharing on the topic of child <br/>\n </span></blockquote>frustration, i.e.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a child who is easily frustrated and gets amped up very quickly and<br/>\n&gt; intensely.
