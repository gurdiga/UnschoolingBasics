There is a middle ground. One where <br/>\nchildren ARE treated with equal respect as adults, but where the parent also <br/>\ncares about themselves and is capable of setting healthy boundaries.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Great! How do I do that?~<br/>\n<br/>\nBy deciding to not force people against their will unless it is truly necessary (to prevent bodily harm or something). To treat them with the same respect you&#39;d give an adult (that doesn&#39;t mean treat them like and adult, but respect them equally). It means do a lot of nice things for them, like pick up their dishes or laundry and smile...by joyful instead of resentful, they will pick up on that aura of joy!<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren WANT to be part of the adult world, unless they&#39;ve learned that adults are the enemy. We must be their partners. I am here to help my children get what they want/need in life, while talking to them (only when necessary) about my own feelings, budget, time constraints..whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are my companions, not my servants that need to obey my every whim. If there is something I feel strongly about, I explain why, my children are very empathetic and helpful. But this atmosphere did not come about on it&#39;s own. We had to leave punishments behind forever. We had to prove that we were interested in their world completely. I do not request things that would take them from something interesting unless it&#39;s really of ultimate importance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fill them up with joy and kindness, they have enough to share back. If we fill them up with resentment and coercion, they&#39;ll use those same tools on us. I think one of the most disturbing things about being a parent, is seeing ME reflected back in how my children talk and act. My sarcastic remarks started coming back to me. My resentment of household chores was evident in their avoidance. Now that I have learned to be joyful about daily life, to breathe deep when struggles arise, I notice helpful, happy people at my side, concerned for my well being.<br/>\nIt works. But we, as the parents, must make the biggest, most difficult changes for it to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I can&#39;t recommend the book &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; enough. It&#39;s that balance you&#39;re looking for I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1554,"nextTopicId":1593}}
