Once Ethan was big enough to ditch the car<br/>\nseat, Ryan wanted none of it. We compromised by using the car seat with the<br/>\nregular seat belt. One day Ryan went in a friend&#39;s car and that mom used the<br/>\n5-point restraint. After that he didn&#39;t car about the 5-point restraint<br/>\nanymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJean Elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://3mommies.blogspot.com\">http://3mommies.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, Sep 18, 2008 at 5:36 PM, Tammy Brock<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tammy@...\">tammy@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a 6 yr old who is currently in a five point harness type of seat.

(good to have the age too since my now 18 yr old<br/>\nwould have barely made it out based on weight! HA!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy second child really hated the carseat... just hated it!   We had<br/>\nthe 5 pt harness and it felt like it squished her legs, we tried<br/>\nvarious other ones and still she felt squished and uncomfortable... we<br/>\ndid however take the 5 pt harness off the booster seat when she was<br/>\nover 40 or 45 lbs whatever the guideline was and just used the car<br/>\nseat belt over her booster.  She was much happier with that<br/>\narrangement!   We did try hard to limit our car time until we could<br/>\nrid ourselves of the 5 pt harness but it wasn&#39;t easy!  There were many<br/>\ndays I waited until Daddy was at home or arranged for her to play with<br/>\na neighbor to avoid her having to go in the car.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what type of seat you are using for your child but wanted to<br/>\npoint out that most 5 pt harness seats are only rated up to 40 lbs or<br/>\nso, I think there are some rated higher and your child may be quite<br/>\nslender and not be over the 40 lbs at age 6... my current 7 yr old is<br/>\nreally tall and muscular so he is 60 lbs..with him we have switched to<br/>\na small booster that just gives him some height in the car (which he<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t need!)  and keeps the seatbelt from bothering his neck.<br/>\n If you are still feeling that according to your state&#39;s law etc that<br/>\nhe needs to be in some sort of car seat perhaps you can take him to<br/>\nthe store and try out different ones and see if there is something<br/>\nthat makes him happy to use. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!   I am so waiting for July 27th next year so we can toss<br/>\nthe car seats until grandchildren!<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tammy Brock&quot; &lt;tammy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a 6 yr old who is currently in a five point harness type of<br/>\nseat.
