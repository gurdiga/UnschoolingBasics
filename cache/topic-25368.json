I think<br/>\nthat you have to weigh her needs against the rest of the<br/>\nfamily..there&#39;s a whole family there that each need their needs<br/>\nhonored as well.   When you have one person bent on destruction and<br/>\nthe whole atmosphere of trust and peace is disrupted by that person<br/>\nyou just have to find a solution that honors as many of those<br/>\nindividuals as possible.   Your daughter was not operating in a<br/>\nrespectful, peaceful way so including her in your household was not<br/>\nworking for any of you.   Hopefully by you taking this stand that she<br/>\nmust respect the needs of others to have her own needs met it will<br/>\ngive her the kick in the pants she needs (not a literal kick in the<br/>\npants but a wake up call... a figurative kick in the pants)   I have<br/>\nknew teens in the same position when I was a teen and in their later<br/>\nyears they realized that their parent did what they felt they needed<br/>\nto to protect the rest of the family...perhaps they were bringing<br/>\ndrugs or dangerous people into the home around younger children,<br/>\nperhaps they were stealing from family members.   Your daughter sounds<br/>\nlike she is really struggling with alot of issues... I know you said<br/>\nthat finances were a big factor ... perhaps you can find a gentle<br/>\ncounselor that can help you two work out the relationship and sort out<br/>\nsome parameters in which the two of you could live.    If this was<br/>\nyour only child you know and we all know that you would have dealt<br/>\nwith it differently but there are others to be considered.   I wish I<br/>\nknew some alternative choice you could have made that would not sit so<br/>\nheavily on your heart... I am not sure there is one.   You sound so<br/>\nbroken about it... perhaps you could write to your daughter and let<br/>\nher know how difficult this decision was for you and how broken<br/>\nhearted you are that this was the decision you felt was your only<br/>\nsolution.  Sometimes kids in that situation feel that they were just<br/>\nthrown out without any thought and that the parent doesn&#39;t really care<br/>\nand that&#39;s why it was so &quot;easy&quot; for you to just throw them out...<br/>\nknowing that it was so hard might help open some communication.   <br/>\nYour only solution in the meantime is to love her through it!<br/>\nI wish I had some great solve all your problems advice but I don&#39;t!<br/>\nPlease know we are all thinking about you and your daughter and hoping<br/>\nshe will understand that the things parents do come from a place of<br/>\nlove for ALL of their children.<br/>\nLisa Blocker<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Snarky comments//teens-gone-wild/this list/Karen&#39;s daughter","postDate":"1185909141","msgId":25368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3MS4xODkzMjM3OS4zM2UwZTM5NUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25392,"prevInTime":25367,"nextInTime":25369,"topicId":25368,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/31/2007 10:26:47 A.M.

That&#39;s *very* hard for us to give  <br/>\nadvice or suggestions for because we advocate starting as early as  <br/>\npossible to develop the trust that is obviously lacking in her case.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not that she *can&#39;t* regain/build trust---it&#39;s just that that is  <br/>\nEXACTLY what we are trying to avoid with our foundation-laying right  <br/>\nnow!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would even venture to say that it&#39;s a lot like deschooling:  Karen&#39;s <br/>\ndaughter will need one month for every year she has been  &quot;traditionally <br/>\nparented&quot; in order to &quot;de-parent&quot; completely. It&#39;s sooo  much easier to <br/>\nstart out that way OR start while the child is still  youngish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________________________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\nyes, and what i did, was NOT follow my heart with her - i was an 18 year  old <br/>\nmama that had some great experiences in Montessori but not with parents that  <br/>\nknew how to fight for me. Oh, they loved the hoopla out of me and still do, <br/>\nand  think I&#39;m making interesting and good choices for the kids, but they were  <br/>\nfear-based. And so when Laura came, I was bullied into public schools and all <br/>\n the bs that went with it. <br/>\n <br/>\nI hope I can deschool her to some extent...I left out LOTS of the story,  <br/>\nlike her early years, my depression and ED and some of my wild, immature times  <br/>\nthat she was around for. *I* think she mainly is angry (in general)  at both <br/>\nmyself and her father (I in fact think it&#39;s more directed at Todd,  her dad, but <br/>\nI&#39;m the mom and I get more of the poo as a result - again,  traditional and <br/>\nconventional stuff causing this teen anger and self  destruction. I also think <br/>\nshe is depressed, as it runs on both sides of the  family and it fits in many <br/>\nways, but that is neither here nor there - I&#39;m  waiting to read the replies to <br/>\ne and doing all the &quot;snarky&quot; posts first,  lol!) and all those years of <br/>\nconvention are indeed biting back! <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, my point is YES! I agree! Starting from the beginning (though I  have <br/>\nalways been unconventional, nursed her for nearly 4 years, co slept a good  <br/>\nbit, &quot;allowed her&quot; dessert first and tried to be as restrictless as possible -  <br/>\nboy the troubles I got from her paternal side! oh, boy! But if ONLY I knew <br/>\nmore  when her school refusal began...I wish so badly I knew more then, but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t go  back, only forwards...anyway......that&#39;s where I am and have been with <br/>\nthe 2  youngest and I see improvements with the other 2 oldest. I think <br/>\npeople are  scared to trust their kids, no doubt about it. <br/>\n <br/>\nObviously I took my personal stuff from this, lol, but I really should have  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes, I agree!&quot; lol! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25391,"nextTopicId":25399}}
