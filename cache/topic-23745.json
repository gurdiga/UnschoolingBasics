Sitcoms and these &quot;edgy&quot; <br/>\ncartoons especially!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey bring up touchy words and subjects that really DON&#39;T come up in <br/>\nevery day conversations! It&#39;s an opening to explain how *I* view that <br/>\nword or situation or subject. Or to clarify what *they* think about it. <br/>\nANd to see how they change (like going from &quot;kissing is yucky&quot; at eight <br/>\nto &quot;why is she licking him?&quot; at eleven to &quot;Mom, what kinds of <br/>\ncontraception have you used?&quot; at 17) &lt;g&gt; Things change! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching TV and movies together make it really easy to eeaasseee into <br/>\ndifficult discussions like sex and drinking and drugs and suicide and <br/>\ntons of other subjects that really don&#39;t get brought up during supper. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I wouldn&#39;t simply  say no. However, with young<br/>\nchildren, especially, wouldn&#39;t it just be better not to have the TV<br/>\nin the house in the first place?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nNo---see my previous post: the Sleeping Beauty example.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n At some point when the children are<br/>\nolder and inevitably ask for a TV and they see this show maybe the<br/>\neffects of watching the violence won&#39;t be quite as harsh as it<br/>\nwould&#39;ve been for a three year old.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, how often does a child see violence portrayed on TV at three <br/>\nyear old? Blues Clues and Dora don&#39;t get too violent!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would someone be watching Kill Bill with a three year old in the <br/>\nroom??? Why would someone watch the news with a three year old in the <br/>\nroom? Seriously! Do any of you DO that? Would you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I&#39;d be worried about in wihholding and then giving tv access <br/>\nis that the older child would be fascinated for an extended period of <br/>\ntime and make all your predictions come true.<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Even if we discuss it with them<br/>\nthe images have been burned into their minds, we can&#39;t fix that or<br/>\ntake that away. Doesn&#39;t this seem valid?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping a child DEAL with difficult images is sooo much more important <br/>\nthan keeping ALL negative things from the child. He *will* see bad <br/>\nstuff. Knowing how to work through it and talk or act it out and <br/>\nknowing that mom is willing to help him through a difficult spot is so <br/>\nmuch more helpful than just closing his eyes to all &quot;danger&quot; and hoping <br/>\nthat he never has to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sure don&#39;t refuse it, but why offer it up in the first place if we <br/>\nthink it may have ill<br/>\neffects?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, *I* don&#39;t think it *will* have ill effects. So it&#39;s there. Right <br/>\nnow at 11:00pm, my husband&#39;s asleep. I&#39;m TiVoing Law & Order, my 19 <br/>\nyear old is out with friends (probably listening to live Blue Grass), <br/>\nand my 11 year old is lying on the trampoline with a friend looking at <br/>\nthe stars and talking. No TV. By choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just rid ourselves of the television?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t want to. It brings joy and opportunities and fun and cool places, <br/>\npeople, and animals into our living room. For pennies/day!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it because as adults we don&#39;t want to give it up?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one reason. And since the adults are the omnipotent beings in <br/>\nthis society, we have the power to keep it or trash it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children usually have no say.

It&#39;s a series of steps -- mostly made <br/>\nup of parents letting go of controls.  I continue to have issues <br/>\nwith TV and sugar.  Since the topic here is TV, I&#39;ll focus on that.  <br/>\nMy kids have unlimited access to movies and videos.  They have their <br/>\nown Netflix profile.  We get movies from the library and the video <br/>\nstore.  They watch things on Youtube.  They have unlimited access to <br/>\ncomputer and video games.  But we don&#39;t have cable which means we <br/>\nget almost no television reception.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true there is a book out there to support any side of any <br/>\nissue.  There seems to be a whole segment of unschoolers (outside of <br/>\nthis list) who support no tv.  It&#39;s an interesting subject - one <br/>\nthat has been talked to death here and on other lists.  And one that <br/>\nties me in knots.  Even Naomi Aldort advocates no TV.  But I know <br/>\npeople who grew up without TV and they really resent it.  I also <br/>\nknow my neighbor (who is 9) feels a bit like Matilda from Roald <br/>\nDahl&#39;s book because her mom keeps the tv on all the time.  But both <br/>\nof those extremes have to do with adult-centered, top down control, <br/>\nnot unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithin unschooling, I can see both sides of to have tv or not.  How <br/>\ndo you justify not having tv in a free house where we want our <br/>\nchildren to have access to every part of our lives?  But on the <br/>\nother hand, it seems that electronic media becomes the eyepiece <br/>\nthrough which kids perceive the world.  And that doesn&#39;t seem real.  <br/>\nWe say that schools are constructs that separate children from the <br/>\nreal world.  Teachers even say that. &quot;When you get in the real <br/>\nworld, you won&#39;t be able to get away with that.&quot;  But how real is 8 <br/>\nhours of Nickelodeon a day?  I think tv is different than a book.  <br/>\nIt can be so dazzling and stimulating, that books are no contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have seen all of their Nick shows.  Some days they watch a <br/>\nlot of videos and movies, other days they don&#39;t.  They are far more <br/>\ninterested in books and playing outside than when we had cable.  <br/>\nMaybe the problem was the commercials and always something new <br/>\ncoming up next.  They can still watch what they want to watch, but <br/>\nthey are not tied to the tv schedule.  I know that the problems we <br/>\nhad with tv - crankiness, fighting, shutting me out - were partly <br/>\ncaused by my issues with tv.  But knowing that didn&#39;t change my <br/>\naxieties about it.

There were times in my  <br/>\nhouse when my parents, my brother, and I were all watching the same  <br/>\nTV show--on three different TVs in three different bedrooms. Because  <br/>\nof that, I had a really hard time agreeing when my partner suggested  <br/>\nwe get a second TV, or that we move a TV into the kids&#39; room from our  <br/>\nroom because they were the only ones who ever watched it. In our  <br/>\nhouse now, getting a second TV was a step to increase our choices and  <br/>\nreduce conflicts. I like to relax by watching DVDs, and David and the  <br/>\nkids are playing video games together a lot in the evening, and with  <br/>\none TV we were having trouble all getting to do what we wanted. But I  <br/>\nstill have moments--if the kids are watching Blue&#39;s Clues on their TV  <br/>\nand I&#39;m watching something on the TV in the living room--when I think  <br/>\nwe&#39;re on the slippery slope to being the house I grew up in, even  <br/>\nthough a lot of other things would have to happen for us to get  <br/>\nthere. I would have to stop liking my children, for instance, and  <br/>\nstop caring about what they want and give no thought or attention to  <br/>\ntheir emotional well-being. That&#39;s not likely!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the house I grew up in--and it sounds like in the one you grew up  <br/>\nin as well--TV was used to avoid reality, to pacify otherwise  <br/>\nbothersome children, and to help us avoid the fights that happened  <br/>\nwhenever we spent more than a few minutes together. In my house now,  <br/>\nwe use it to relax; to be entertained; to learn; for my five-year- <br/>\nold, to have some non-napping down time. We use it for family  <br/>\ntogetherness.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of how I grew up, and because of one period in my young adult  <br/>\nlife when I was isolated and depressed (after moving cross-country to  <br/>\nbe with a lover, only to get dumped upon arrival) and watched endless  <br/>\nTV--I felt so addicted to it at that time that I eventually packed it  <br/>\naway in my closet--all the anti-TV arguments really resonated with me  <br/>\nfor a long time.

Better?<br/>\n<br/>\nLimiting a form of communication out of fear may not be the best<br/>\nreason for not having one. Viewing tv as potentially harmful is not<br/>\nonly fear-based, but inaccurate. It&#39;s just a box that when turned on,<br/>\nhas information we choose to access. That&#39;s all. Just like a book, or<br/>\na radio.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the way a parent handles images viewed, has a greater effect<br/>\nthan the images themselves. If a child DOES see something before<br/>\nthey&#39;re ready, the parent has an opportunity to calmly support,<br/>\nexplain tv/movie effects and not be overreactive. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your child saw real-life violence? How are you going to censor<br/>\nthat?  What if they watched an animal or a person get hit by a car? My<br/>\nchildren were with me immediately following a pedestrian accident<br/>\nwhere the woman was unconsicous laying in the street. I stopped to<br/>\nhelp. By stopping to assist, they were given full view of everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember being very upset on occasions as a child because my Dad<br/>\nalways stopped to help at car wrecks (he had training and always<br/>\ncarried certain emergency items with us, including army blankets) and<br/>\nI saw some things that were pretty intense for a young child. The<br/>\nmanner in which my parents handled it really helped me. Real life<br/>\nviolence always affected me on a much deeper level than anything a tv<br/>\ncould offer up!! I knew it was REAL. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy upsetness was a process of dealing with real people being injured<br/>\n(and one time transporting injured people due to the nature of<br/>\nemergency help in remote locations in Alaska) and how to cope with<br/>\nthat. I&#39;d say it was a very positive experience in my life, though it<br/>\nwas sometimes scary to see a car on fire, or injured people etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nTV just can&#39;t come close to that in my mind!  After seeing injured<br/>\npeople, it stays with me. Tv is just entertainment or<br/>\ninformation...big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that everyone has a different level of sensitivity and tv<br/>\nwill affect others, where it isn&#39;t affecting me. I just don&#39;t see how<br/>\na tv image can have this horrible life-long impact if the  parents are<br/>\n being supportive and assisting their children in having their needs met.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also work in a business where we learn about movie/tv effects and<br/>\nstudy that. My kids see magazines that show how to create realistic<br/>\nzombies and injuries and what-not. How to make a believable scene or<br/>\nspecial effect is a common topic of discussion. I think knowing all<br/>\nthat behind-the-scenes information gives the violent or intense scenes<br/>\na lot less power.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Fetteroll","from":"Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Guidance","postDate":"1179489288","msgId":23801,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCRTUyOTk5LUMxQjUtNDQ0Ny05RUEwLTg3ODJEM0ZBQ0RCN0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ5NjYzRThGLTFGOTEtNDgwQS05N0NFLUE3M0REQ0M4NjA5MkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEQ5NjYzRThGLTFGOTEtNDgwQS05N0NFLUE3M0REQ0M4NjA5MkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":23780,"nextInTopic":23803,"prevInTime":23800,"nextInTime":23802,"topicId":23745,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You can&#39;t not live your  <br/>\nlife with the fears you have towards TV -- it might be as subtle as a  <br/>\nstiffening of your body when you hear a mother relate how her 4 yo  <br/>\nloves the news -- and not communicate that you have fears to your  <br/>\nkids. They won&#39;t feel as free to ask for TV as they might a book or a  <br/>\ntoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it isn&#39;t the lack of TV that will elicit discussion but your  <br/>\n*reasons* for not having a TV.

Did you watch because you wanted to be with your mom? How much  <br/>\ndid she understand that it upset you? If she didn&#39;t, why didn&#39;t she?  <br/>\nWhat did she do to help you with your fears? If she knew and didn&#39;t  <br/>\ndo anything, why didn&#39;t she? If she knew and was ineffectual, why was  <br/>\nshe?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fear is unfounded in a mindful home. While it&#39;s impossible to  <br/>\nprevent a sensitive child from accidently seeing something that will  <br/>\nupset them -- whether on TV or in real life -- when we&#39;re sensitive  <br/>\nto what our kids want, we won&#39;t be helping them find things  that  <br/>\nwill upset them.

There was some disconnection that kept you seeing things  <br/>\nthat were harming you. You could have turned it off. Your mother  <br/>\ncould have turned it off. But something in your home life kept you  <br/>\nwatching. It wasn&#39;t the TV, but you&#39;ve chosen to blame the TV. It&#39;s  <br/>\neasier to blame the TV than to dig further. It&#39;s easier to ban TV  <br/>\nthan to take what *feels* like risks (but, from experience with  <br/>\nmindfully parented unschooled kids we&#39;ve shown you plenty of counter  <br/>\nexamples.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your husband too is cutting off the discussion because of  <br/>\nfears. It&#39;s much easier to ease a fear than face it. He has grasped  <br/>\nat the easy solution of getting rid of TV because he fears the  <br/>\neffects. It&#39;s a lot harder to drag those fears out and examine them  <br/>\nagainst what really happens with kids who are given freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Why not just rid ourselves of the television?

It&#39;s always good to dig deep and  <br/>\nexamine our motives behind our choices, especially choices that  <br/>\naffect our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your question comes from the point of view that TV is harmful.  <br/>\nWhat we&#39;re asking you to examine is what were the causes behind what  <br/>\nhappened to you? We have kids who have the freedom to watch whatever  <br/>\nthey want and the same thing hasn&#39;t happened to them. Why? With the  <br/>\nsame factor (TV) the outcome is different so it can&#39;t be the TV.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re comparing your life and our lives but there&#39;s some *other*  <br/>\nfactor that&#39;s caused the different outcomes. *That&#39;s* what you need  <br/>\nto examine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Please someone tell me<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m being mindful of my child&#39;s needs and that I didn&#39;t sell my<br/>\n&gt; TV and episodes of The Golden Girls that I had on DVD for no reason!:)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was a reason that made sense at the time!

They *trust* the parent understands what bothers them  <br/>\npersonally (for my daughter it was moving skeletons) and the  <br/>\ninformation is tailored specifically to them. But they also know that  <br/>\ntheir limits are always changing. (My daughter can watch movies with  <br/>\nmoving skeletons now.)

They <br/>\nknow I&#39;m always nearby to &quot;rescue&quot; them if they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuidance? Maybe you think that&#39;s about keeping things from them until <br/>\nyou&#39;re ready to let them know about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, it means keeping them safe from things that could be harmful <br/>\nuntil *THEY* are ready to test their limits. How do I know when they <br/>\nare ready? Because the whole world is open to them, they do it with <br/>\nbaby steps. They don&#39;t need to ask permission or sneak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t watch Kill Bill when Duncan was around. He wouldn&#39;t appreciate <br/>\nit. (It bothered me a bit as well!) He was a little frightened by a <br/>\ncouple of scenes in Lord of the Rings, but I held him close and told <br/>\nhim when he could open his eyes. We talked about it a lot afterwards. <br/>\nIf I had told him that the movie was just too intense for him, he would <br/>\nhave believed me because he trusts me. But if I had refused to let him <br/>\nwatch because *I* know better, he may have begged to watch, gone, and <br/>\ngotten scared, but not want to tell me how scared he was (and lived <br/>\nwith that fear for days/weeks/months) OR he could have gone to see it <br/>\nwithout me and never tell me that he saw it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLying, sneaking and guilt are not good for any relationship, and since <br/>\nmy relationship with my boys is THE most important thing, we work <br/>\ntogether to get what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuidance, to me, means walking hand-in-hand while pointing out <br/>\npotential problems and possible solutions. I do NOT tell him what to <br/>\ndo, but I&#39;m happy to tell him what *I* would do IF he asks. I&#39;m OK if <br/>\nhe decides on a different course---it could be a better one than I  <br/>\nwould have chosen. If not, I&#39;m happy to help him get out of the <br/>\nuncomfortable position he&#39;s in. He knows I trust him, so he trusts me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to have limited his world (by not allowing certain shows or <br/>\nby keeping certain things &quot;secret&quot; or hidden or by not talking about <br/>\nthem) how would he be able to make decisions? Then I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\n*guiding* him; I&#39;d be *stopping* him from exploring his world. If I <br/>\nwere to somehow feed him my perceptions (TV&#39;s bad, junk food&#39;s bad, <br/>\nsome programs/movies are bad/not worthy) that became counter to what <br/>\n*HE* thinks are good or valuable, then what&#39;s a child to do? What <br/>\nbecome his options? Lie? Sneak? Be filled wih guilt?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he can&#39;t trust me to trust him with small things like tv and sodas, <br/>\nhow do I think he will trust me with *such* bigger issues like drugs <br/>\nand sex?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust doesn&#39;t develop overnight. It&#39;s a process that takes years and <br/>\nyears and years. The earlier you start, the sooner it&#39;ll be a part of <br/>\nyour lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
