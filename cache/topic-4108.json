She hasn&#39;t played piano much this year so Sandra <br/>\nmay not see any improvement when she gets here next week!!!  But she&#39;s <br/>\nprogressed tremendously in her singing. Last night she told me she felt <br/>\nlike her &quot;support&quot; was quadrupled over the last 6 months and her <br/>\ncomfortable range extended over an octave higher than a year ago. She&#39;s <br/>\n17 and she is still not taking voice &quot;lessons&quot; - but she participates <br/>\nin musical theater workshops that include some vocal training and she <br/>\ntook a couple of voices classes over the past year. She&#39;s starring in a <br/>\nyouth theater production of Pirates of Penzance - she&#39;s Mabel, the <br/>\nfemale lead. The is operetta - difficult vocal stuff. She LOVES it <br/>\npassionately and the very idea of somebody else making her practice is <br/>\nludicrous - she works hard because it is her passion. Back when Rox was <br/>\nfirst showing that she was very serious about singing, I talked to <br/>\nSandra about whether I should get her involved in taking voice lessons <br/>\n- Roxana was probably 9 years old at the time. Sandra pretty much <br/>\nencouraged me to just let her do what she was doing - singing all the <br/>\ntime - alone or in groups when she got the chance. She said that voice <br/>\nlessons for young children could be risky for various reasons that all <br/>\nmade sense to me. So she didn&#39;t take any lessons at all until she was <br/>\n14. Then, at that time, she was &quot;behind&quot; a lot of other kids her age <br/>\nwho had been taking formal lessons - and she didn&#39;t get any big parts <br/>\nin shows, just barely got into the ensembles. But her talent was there <br/>\nand her drive was there and now she&#39;s starting to really excel and get <br/>\nsome bigger parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really important thing is that she&#39;s done all of this ENTIRELY on <br/>\nher own initiative. Not once have I ever told her to practice. I drive <br/>\nher around. I applaud loudly. I tell her when her singing moves me. But <br/>\nI don&#39;t even know what she&#39;s working on or what she should be working <br/>\non...that&#39;s all up to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 24, 2004, at 8:54 AM, Ren Allen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Sandra told a story at Kelly&#39;s house after the 2003 conference....I<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t remember who it was about (One of your dd&#39;s PamS?) but she had<br/>\n&gt; visited the house and saw simple sheet music on the piano.

Made me <br/>\ncringe just reading about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your goal?<br/>\n<br/>\nMine wasn&#39;t that they become concert violinists or pianists - it was <br/>\nthat they have the JOY of music in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it isn&#39;t joyful in the learning, then I&#39;m sacrificing their current <br/>\nlife to some possible future life when they&#39;ll play violin so well that <br/>\nthey WILL find joy in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell the teacher that you&#39;ll be happy with whatever pace of learning <br/>\nhappens - that you&#39;re not as concerned with your child moving ahead <br/>\nquickly as you are that the learning process is a constant source of <br/>\njoy in your lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen &quot;play around&quot; - don&#39;t practice anymore at ALL.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with it. If it isn&#39;t fun, stop.<br/>\nDon&#39;t correct her posture or her being on the wrong notes - let her <br/>\nenjoy herself without being criticized. She will pick up the posture <br/>\nand hold her bow right and all that - over time - but you have to let <br/>\nher be - let her have fun and experiment. Let her play the pieces that <br/>\nshe WANTS to play, let her go to the lessons without having played at <br/>\nall in between, if she enjoys the lessons, then why not?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter took piano lessons for a year. She loved the teacher <br/>\nand the lessons. She almost never touched the piano in between lessons. <br/>\nI told the teacher that that was okay with me - that the lessons were <br/>\nfun and that that was enough for us. Amazingly, my daughter progressed <br/>\nanyway - probably a lot more slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle daughter didn&#39;t want to take lessons, but taught herself to <br/>\nplay piano. And she never &quot;practiced&quot; - she just played. She almost <br/>\nalways picked pieces that were far too difficult (we have a lot of <br/>\nmusic accumulated over the years) and she&#39;d pick out bits of it and <br/>\nslowly put it together until she could play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of them eventually took some lessons - in their teens. They are <br/>\nextremely comfortable with music. They don&#39;t really remember learning <br/>\nto read music - they just &quot;picked it up&quot; the same way they learned to <br/>\nread English.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure, but I think my 3rd daughter reads music pretty well, too. <br/>\nShe plays around on the keyboard a lot - since she wears headphones, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t hear what she&#39;s playing. But she uses two hands and seems to be <br/>\nplaying from various piano books.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - they have so much fun with music in their lives and they&#39;re not <br/>\nafraid of it - if they want lessons, they ask, but mostly they learn <br/>\nfrom other people and from books.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest plays guitar pretty well - she&#39;s a singer, taught herself <br/>\nguitar with a little help from her friends. My youngest has recently <br/>\nstarted playing guitar - played nonstop for a few months, carried her <br/>\nguitar everywhere. Got to be able to play a lot of chords. Now she <br/>\nplays every few days, sometimes once a week or so. Neither of them ever <br/>\n&quot;practice.&quot; They find songs they want to learn and they play them - and <br/>\nas they play them they get better at playing them.

If<br/>\nyour dd maintains an interest in playing well, for her own purposes, she<br/>\nwill notice that she is playing the wrong notes. She will observe the others<br/>\nin her group and self-correct, or at the right moment *for her* she *will*<br/>\nsay something like &quot;How should I hold my arm?&quot; or &quot;What am I doing wrong<br/>\nwith this?&quot; Until then she will have so much joy in what she is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How much sense is there in practicing it the <br/>\nwrong way?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the goal of practicing is enhancing your understanding of the instrument,<br/>\nenjoying actually using it, and experimenting with music, then there is no<br/>\nwrong way. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The problem with music lessons is that one really has to practice in <br/>\nbetween. Otherwise you turn up at every lesson at the same point as you <br/>\nwhere before.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people have stories of this not happening. Also, so what if there<br/>\nare periods of static consolidation? You and your dd should be the ones with<br/>\nthe goals and in charge of your own lessons and pace of learning. I suppose<br/>\nif they took the punishing point of view that dd couldn&#39;t play in the<br/>\nconcert that might be a problem, to which I would say find other<br/>\nopportunities for her to perform. Maybe still do that, if that is what she<br/>\nlikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Alpert talks a lot about his kid&#39;s violin playing in &quot;And the Skylark<br/>\nSings With Me&quot;. I recall it being a wonderful, long process. His dd played<br/>\nin public to raise money - street performing (busking as they say in<br/>\nAustralia) - with a lot of success and enjoyment, without ever being a<br/>\n&quot;prodigy&quot; or wanting to make it her profession.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How would John Holt hepl a child to learn an instrument?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI recall from his books that his biggest suggestion is to let the child play<br/>\naround, on their own terms, with any new instrument or tool, to familiarize<br/>\nthemselves with it from the place of their own understanding, for quite a<br/>\nlong time, until they express the readiness to have any kind of lesson in<br/>\nthe proper method of use. For example he would say let the kid play fantasy<br/>\ngames with the chess pieces for while before telling them the rules of the<br/>\ngame. I guess he would completely disagree with the fake violin stuff that<br/>\nSuzuki evidently does initially. He used to bring his cello to pre-schools<br/>\nand just let the kids make noise on it (he called it &quot;making the machine<br/>\nwork&quot;), which they evidently received a great deal of joy from.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t want to have to make her practice. Shall her just ignore <br/>\nthe teacher&#39;s instructions on how often to practice something and only <br/>\nlet her do it how and how many times she wants?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYep.

My 6 yo  found a yamaha keyboard at<br/>\ncostco and really thought it was fun, so we bought it.<br/>\n Right away we learned how to do all the fun<br/>\nstuff--making it bark like a dog, making it sound like<br/>\na car crash--so she knows how to get it to do what she<br/>\nwants.  It just sits next to the computer here, and<br/>\nshe turns it on whenever the muse strikes.  It has a<br/>\n&quot;piano lessons&quot; section where it will teach you which<br/>\nnotes to play, but it accompanies the player so<br/>\nwhatever you play always sounds beautiful, no matter<br/>\nwhat level you play at (boy, I wish I would have had<br/>\nthat as a kid!)  She also found a small electronic<br/>\nkeyboard built in to a book on the clearance rack at<br/>\nBarnes and Noble, which taught how to play with<br/>\ncolored spots matching the notes--like 12 nursury<br/>\nryhme songs that she knows.  She can now transpose<br/>\nthem onto the large keyboard, even though there are no<br/>\ncolored dots on it.   So, she&#39;s 6, and she can play<br/>\nabout 14 songs, completely self-taught, and that makes<br/>\nher unbelievably happy.  She can also make me think<br/>\nthere&#39;s a car wreck or rabid dogs out my window ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

I wasn&#39;t <br/>\nkeen on the idea at first because I didn&#39;t want to have to make her <br/>\npractice. But because they were Suzuki lessons and I had heard (but not <br/>\nread) about John Holt&#39;s Never to late, I thought it would be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first it was and my dd really loves all the games the music teacher <br/>\nplays. But the time without the real violin (practicing on a broken one <br/>\nwithout strings and a rod) dragged on and she got tired of the many <br/>\n&#39;games&#39; we had to practice. Finally she got her real violin and went <br/>\naround for days picking it up and playing on it. So I thought &#39;we&#39;re <br/>\naway&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut lately it has gotten to the point where it is just &#39;having to <br/>\npractice&#39; no matter how many imaginary games the teacher comes up with <br/>\nto help her keep the bow straight etc. She gets frustrated when she <br/>\ncan&#39;t get it right and also as more and more playing is added that has <br/>\nto be practiced.<br/>\nI have been learning the violin along side her as is required by the <br/>\nSuzuki method. To start off I found it harder to motivate myself to <br/>\npractice. I used to play guitar and had thought I could learn it easily <br/>\nbecause of that, but it wasn&#39;t. My fingers didn&#39;t find the right spot <br/>\non the fingerboard and my arm got tired so quickly holding the violin <br/>\nup. Just to get a comfortable hold of it under my chin took weeks. So I <br/>\nwas kind of despondent when my dd showed signs of that same <br/>\nfrustration. If I as her coach was  not feeling great how could she?<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept on going however and have just got to a point where the basic <br/>\nstuff comes more easily. Because I&#39;m musical I have started to play <br/>\nother tunes and also palying more advanced pieces that come further on <br/>\nin the book. Some nights I play for nearly an hour until my arm just <br/>\ncan&#39;t hold up anymore. It is fun now.<br/>\nIt was like that too when I learned the guitar at 10yo. I haf begged <br/>\nfor lessons and when finally got some I just loved playing. Nobody had <br/>\nto say &#39;go and practice&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I find it so disheartening when I see my 5.5yo dd unhappiness. I can <br/>\nsee that she actually likes the instrument and the playing, but at the <br/>\nlesson and also at home (I&#39;m expected to correct her) she gets <br/>\ncorrected and I think it overwhelmes her now and she is thinking that <br/>\nit is just too hard. but I think the thought of the music teacher is <br/>\nthat if we don&#39;t correct her, she will learn a bad posture, fingering <br/>\netc and it will be hard to unlearn.<br/>\nthe music teacher is very very nice and very positive. she does all the <br/>\ncorrections in a very positive way and mostly non verbal. She used <br/>\nimagination to try and help. Songs, ryhmes etc. But in the end, it&#39;s <br/>\nstill a correction. I understand how my dd feels because sometimes at <br/>\nthe beginning I remember feeling a little like that too &#39;this is so <br/>\nhard to do, I feel like giving up&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might also not be doing it the best way. I feel like playing one <br/>\npiece just one time is not enough and try and get her to play a little <br/>\nmore. I offer to play with her and that helps but i can&#39;t play and <br/>\ncorrect her posture at the same time. if I don&#39;t correct anything she <br/>\nisn&#39;t feeling to bad, but then she is holding her bow very wrong and <br/>\nplaying out of tune etc. How much sense is there in practicing it the <br/>\nwrong way?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with music lessons is that one really has to practice in <br/>\nbetween. Otherwise you turn up at every lesson at the same point as you <br/>\nwhere before.<br/>\nDo unschooled kids learn instruments with regular lessons? Do they <br/>\nstart later? I think it is better for kids to start later but the <br/>\nSuzuki people want them to start as early a poss. there is lots about <br/>\nthe Suzuki method my dd loves. She loves the concerts per term (she&#39;s <br/>\njust played in her first one). She loves the group lessons each week <br/>\nand she still mostly loves the lessons. She wants to learn to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would John Holt hepl a child to learn an instrument? Has anyone <br/>\nread his book on how he learned the Cello? i can&#39;t get that book atm so <br/>\nany feedback greatly appreciated. I don&#39;t want to spoil it all for her. <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t want to have to make her practice.

My thought is: i did not know that one could apply <br/>\nunschooling to all of life! i really love my son and i dont want to <br/>\nput the same constraints on him that i had as a child. i remember <br/>\nhaving to clean my room, wash the dishes, clean the entire kitchen, <br/>\nclean the bathroom, and dust...all of which i hated more and more as <br/>\ntime went on as my mother and father forced me. now i cant stand <br/>\ncleaning! i cant stand it!! i have to force myself to do it <br/>\nsometimes, and other times im happy to do it. i find that my husband <br/>\ncan be the same way as my parents when it comes to stuff like that. <br/>\nwhen given my space and time and CONFIDENCE FROM OTHERS, i end up <br/>\ndoing everything with time to spare...and doing it right the FIRST <br/>\ntime. i dont want to make my son feel the same way as i did (and do) <br/>\nabout household things. i am near tears now just thinking about it <br/>\nall. i am do desparate to make the right choices about how to raise <br/>\nhim... i had to undo a lot that was done to me and i really dont <br/>\nwant him to have to do the same. he makes his own choices about lots <br/>\nof things now, like when he wants to clean up his toys and what he <br/>\nwants to wear, what he wants to eat and when, what he wants to drink <br/>\nand when...and especially what he wants to learn and when. pretty <br/>\nmuch the only things he doesnt dictate are when he goes to bed and <br/>\nwhen he gets his diaper changed. i know he is not even 2, but he is <br/>\nsuch an awesome kid! i dont want to screw it up for him. im gonna <br/>\nstop now before i repeat myself... thoughts????</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4177,"nextTopicId":4151}}
