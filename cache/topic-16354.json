I have been on the unschooling path for close to a year now.  I have recently been engaged in some really intense healing and growing on the personal level and am realizing just how much unschooling fits in with my emerging life philosophy.  I am coming to learn that all that we need lies within.  And just like I have come to find that special place within myself, my children need the space and freedom to do the same.  I don&#39;t know how we would do this without unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo all, I have not posted in a while but I have to say that I just love this group and those of you who serve as mentors to us sometimes hard headed newbies, I say THANK YOU!  So many newbies don&#39;t realize the priceless gift you give in the form of wisdom.  Radical unschooling is cutting edge and truly one path toward a future that is free of war and full of peace, love and respect for all of creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: Amy Mason &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:doodlemakers@...\">doodlemakers@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/06 Sun PM 10:45:45 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>,  <br/>\n Arc-Homeschool &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:arc-homeschool@yahoogroups.com\">arc-homeschool@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] I&#39;m a born again radical unschooler!

We&#39;ve had our first night of stay up until you want to go <br/>\nto sleep and I have to say it&#39;s the most pleasant night I&#39;ve had in a <br/>\nlong time.  We had no bedtime quarrels...no &quot;get back in bed&quot;...no &quot;this <br/>\nis the last sip&quot;...no &quot;stop stealing the covers from your sisters&quot;...my <br/>\ntwo youngest were asleep on their own schedule by 8:45.  My night owl <br/>\ndaughter came to me around 10:30 and snuggled on the rocking chair while <br/>\nwe read books back and forth to each other (she&#39;s a self taught reader) <br/>\nand then she curled up and fell right to sleep next to me.  My early to <br/>\nbed son is still down with husband on the couch watching him play soccer <br/>\non the XBOX.  He and I played MotoGP together earlier.  He&#39;s trying to <br/>\nstay up until we decide to go to bed but judging by his drooping lids he <br/>\nwon&#39;t make it.  My family has done a 360 in a matter of days, little <br/>\nmore each day and I can&#39;t imagine life any better.  It makes so much <br/>\nsense now.  Just like you wonderful folks on the unschooling boards <br/>\nadvised me to ask myself &quot;why are we doing it this way&quot; I realized that <br/>\neverything, well almost everything, we previously did was because that <br/>\nwas the way it was done for us because we were public schooled and had <br/>\nto be up early and sat at the table for meals because that was the only <br/>\ntime we were all together etc...(except for my own instincts regarding <br/>\nattachment parenting which are not the norm for the way things were done <br/>\nwhile we grew up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Thank you Thank you...and to the wonderful resources out there <br/>\non the internet and library...thank you John Holt...and good night :-)<br/>\nAmy in WV</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16364,"nextTopicId":16388}}
