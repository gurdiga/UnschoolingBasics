My daughter is 15 months old and has not had any well-baby visits or vaccinations. My intuition tells me not to vaccinate. My husband says he wants to research before making a fianl decision, but so far, he has done no research- I think ultimately he believes that the risks of vaccinations are greater than the benefits. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are some vaccines, like the chicken pox, that I am not sure why this is needed. I had chicken pox, and though it was uncomfortable for a week, I survived, and am now stronger for it. If we never give our immune system the opportunity to overcome sickness, then we will become weaker overall. With questionable ingredients, and aggressive schedules, I don&#39;t feel good about, nor do I trust, those that tell me that I should blindly trust the doctors and associations that encourage all of these vaccinations. Vaccination does not equal immunity!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  That being said, here are some really great resources for you:<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Vaccinations by Aviva Jill Romm- she is very informative. It would be hard to guess what her stance is on the issue as this book is all about giving facts, not her own personal opinion. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/2/14/why-vaccines-aren-t-safe.aspx\">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/2/14/why-vaccines-aren-t-safe.aspx</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.truehealthfacts.com/reasearch-news/vaccines.html\">http://www.truehealthfacts.com/reasearch-news/vaccines.html</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinktwice.com/\">http://thinktwice.com/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nvic.org/\">http://www.nvic.org/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.know-vaccines.org/autism.html\">http://www.know-vaccines.org/autism.html</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.informedchoice.info/index.php\">http://www.informedchoice.info/index.php</a><br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have not done a ton of research on these links, they are just what I have in my &quot;when I have spare time&quot; pile of links to look through. As with any resource, take it with a grain of salt and follow your intuition. I would also recommend finding a Natropath as they know natural ways of combating concerns over diseases, viruses, etc. Natropaths work WITH your body and nature to find optimal health. I believe most doctors work against your body by pushing prescriptions and other highly medicalized procedures. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope that this is helpful!

I even think it is reasonable to question my reasons for vaccinating my children &lt;BWG&gt;. I think that at some level the anti-vac versus pro-vac discussions are much like the anti-abortion versus pro-choice discussions, it is about a certain level of faith. My faith, my questioning ends up with me trusting much of what the scientific community has found, your faith leads you to questioning those backed by the government or big business/drug companies. My great-uncle Murvail died of diptheria. He was 3 years old. My dad gave Simon a plated silver bowl and plate set that Murvail owned. They both have Simple Simon rhymes on them.  His last words to his mother, my grandmother&#39;s adopted mother, were &quot;The water is so deep and so cold.&quot; His mother believed that you passed over a great body of water before you died because of what her son said, her little boy. If I could I would vaccinate Murvail. I would DTaP<br/>\n him just as I did Simon and Linnaea. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe polio outbreak that you cited, the one in China, demonstrates nicely &quot;herd immunity&quot;. To sum up, for those who are vaguely interested but didn&#39;t follow the link, China irradicated wild polio in 2000. It isn&#39;t mentioned in the article, but in India, where there is still wild polio, prior to introduction of a vaccine 1000 children a day were suffering paralysis at polio&#39;s hands, post vaccination it is down to 5 a day. I can&#39;t find the citation for that. I can find the 1000 a day, easily, but the 5 a day was from an interview with Nick Grassly that I can&#39;t find again. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_17-11-2006-13-18-5\">http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_17-11-2006-13-18-5</a> says 1000 a day and down to 1500 in 2006 through November). In China 6 children had acute and residual paralysis. They were in a population that had a 72% uptake of the polio vaccine. On the Wikipedia page on herd immunity the threshhold is 80%-86% of the population needs to be immunized for<br/>\n there to be a herd immunity affect for polio. The vaccine was live polio, which is no longer used in the U.S. And it doesn&#39;t spread among those who are vaccinated, interestingly enough, none of the paralysed 6 were vaccinated. And it was stopped by immunizing the rest of the population. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a lot to be said for herd immunity. I think that one of the considerations if you are going to wait to vaccinate is the uptake of vaccine within the area you live. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity</a> has a really nice table to use for risk assessment. If most people are vaccinated then not vaccinating is pretty safe. The poster who said that we don&#39;t carry illness about in our person is right, but if we get chicken pox or measles or diptheria or whooping cough, than we do put those who are immunocompromised, or unvaccinated, at risk. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found an article at the New York Times from before the varicella vaccination that talks about the risks of chicken pox to some and the halcyon days of yore : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA143CF936A15751C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1.\">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA143CF936A15751C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and there isn&#39;t a varicella vaccine in the UK. It wasn&#39;t deemed a necessary public expense. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 20 July, 2008 5:41:34 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Looking for vaccine info<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~One of the problems with not vaccinating is that you are exposing<br/>\nothers who may <br/>\nbe less able to cope to diseases.

That&#39;s a<br/>\ngood thing.  Read both.  See where your lifestyle, your child&#39;s health,<br/>\nand basically your reality fit in.  For example, are you exclusively<br/>\nbreastfeeding?  Do you plan on daycare?  Travelling?  Any allergies to<br/>\nworry about?  Or religious beliefs?  Likelihood of contracting a<br/>\ndisease?  Effects of contracting the disease?  You may also consider<br/>\nwhether there are some diseases you want your child to get naturally. <br/>\nYou should really tailor it to your child&#39;s needs.  It will all boil<br/>\ndown to a risk /benefit analysis for each vaccine.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou already did that with hep b.  Probably because the baby didn&#39;t need<br/>\nit, thereby exposing him/her to any of the risks seemed ridiculous given<br/>\nthe fact that there was zero benefit, not to mention that the effects<br/>\nare likely to wear off by the time he/she may be at risk.  You may find<br/>\nthis to be true with several other of the recommended vaccines.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks I recommend are &quot;What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About<br/>\nChildren&#39;s Vaccines&quot; by Stephanie Cave, and my favorite, &quot;The Vaccine<br/>\nGuide&quot; by Randall Neustaedter.  The former is more neutral.  The latter<br/>\nis pretty anti-vaccine, although I find it objective, but I lean very<br/>\nmuch towards his philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I believe you have plenty of time to educate yourself<br/>\non the subject.

I<br/>\nam traveling right now or I would spend the time finding it for you. <br/>\nThe big thing is how the sheer number of vaccines have grown since we<br/>\nwere kids and trooping off to the doctor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe research is just not there yet to know if this huge number of<br/>\nshots (20+ in by age 2) has any side effects.  Each vaccine is<br/>\nconsidered safe by itself based on trials (but drug trials in children<br/>\nis whole other topic...) but it is the combination of so many of them,<br/>\nover a short period of time, in a small developing body that has not<br/>\nbeen adequately studied.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I appreciate Schuyler&#39;s point about developing<br/>\ncountries.  I have lived in SE Asia and traveled widely in Latin<br/>\nAmerica and have witnessed mothers rioting in the street to get access<br/>\nto vaccines for their children. When less than half of your children<br/>\nmake it to age 5 due to childhood illnesses, vaccines look pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has had a passport since he was 6 months old.  We knew that if<br/>\nwe were going to travel with him, we would have to vaccinate.<br/>\nAdditionally, the spring before I became pregnant I had had whooping<br/>\ncough and it was a horrible experience so I knew I didn&#39;t want to<br/>\nexpose a tiny baby to that trial.  There are regular whooping cough<br/>\noutbreaks in Tucson and I knew I would go along with the DTaP. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to selectively vaccinate on an extended schedule, though found<br/>\nit challenging with my current pediatrician. I also regularly dosed<br/>\nhim with 1000mg of Vitamin C prior to each shot (I believe I got this<br/>\nrecommendation from my Dr Sears Baby Book.)  The only vax we had<br/>\ntrouble with was the MMR.  My son had a significant fever and general<br/>\nunwellness that I would not want to repeat.  We recently had a measles<br/>\noutbreak in Tucson and my friends with young children (under age 2)<br/>\nwho were still going to frequent well-baby visits were getting<br/>\npressured to give ANOTHER MMR shot to their children.  This didn&#39;t<br/>\nmake sense to me and it is in this way that I think the proponents of<br/>\nvaccinations lose their credibility even when there may be a vital<br/>\nreason to vaccinate.<br/>\n<br/>\nTough topic and very challenging to parse the different sides as the<br/>\nvested interests have so much at stake from the altruistic, i.e.<br/>\npublic health concerns, to the economic, the huge profits of Big<br/>\nPharma as well as the current economics of running a pediatric<br/>\npractice - vaccine reimbursements are the foundation of their finances.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nKerry<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Lisa Smith &lt;goobergrl6@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; my first 2 were vax&#39;ed on schedule.
