But<br/>\nthe reality of it is that it is only the people who get burned badly who<br/>\nneed to worry about skin cancer. Growing up we didn�t have sun block. (It<br/>\nmight have been out there, but we didn�t have it)  We are an olive skinned<br/>\nfamily that doesn�t burn easily but for many people, burning isn�t an issue<br/>\nif you are frequently outside because you gradually tan as the season<br/>\nprogresses and then by the time the hot July sun is beating down burning<br/>\nisn�t as much of an issue. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that aside, I�ve seen so many people who fight with their kids over<br/>\nthings that don�t have to be a fight if they are creative enough.  That and<br/>\nI don�t think that most people give their kids enough credit for<br/>\nunderstanding them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela S.<br/>\n<br/>\nHYPERLINK &quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife Is Good! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.405 / Virus Database: 268.12.4/449 - Release Date: 9/15/2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.405 / Virus Database: 268.12.4/449 - Release Date: 9/15/2006<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] impossible not to use coercive methods?","postDate":"1158541821","msgId":17310,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRhOC44ZTIxMTRkLjMyM2Y0YmZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17381,"prevInTime":17309,"nextInTime":17311,"topicId":17310,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/17/2006 8:33:05 P.M.

There IS a solution if you are  willing to <br/>\nwork it out.  My boys HATE sun screen and hats.  LOL   So we have been there, <br/>\ndone that.  These are some of the things we have  done/do.  Bring the X box to <br/>\nthe beach with us and play that until it is  later in the day when the sun is <br/>\nnot so hot.  We have bought those swimming  shirts, very light, long sleeves <br/>\nthat the boys wear when the sun is hot.   Sometimes they will agree to sunscreen <br/>\non some areas, like legs or arms.   We have also tried different sun screens.  <br/>\nThere are a couple of zinc  products that my boys like more than the <br/>\ntraditional sunscreen, it has no odor  really.  Finding a shady place to play.  <br/>\nSometimes they will agree to  getting up early to play before it gets peak sun time, <br/>\nthen we come in for lunch  and more inside play before we head back out in <br/>\nthe late afternoon.  Oh and  our favorite time on the beach is midnight.  No one <br/>\nelse is out there, we  all have headlights and it is soooo much fun to build <br/>\na sand castle in the  dark.  Although we don&#39;t swim on the beach at night we <br/>\ncan go back to the  pool if we want to swim.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOK I guess those are a few of the solutions that have  worked in our family.  <br/>\nThe key for us is to WORK out a solution that is  agreeable to everyone.  And <br/>\nbelieving that there is one is so important,  otherwise I think when you <br/>\ncan&#39;t reach a solution with a couple of tries you  fall back to coercion.  Also <br/>\nkids are so great at coming up with the most  creative solutions, ask them.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing I have used with friends before, who just  don&#39;t get consensual <br/>\nliving or unschooling is &quot;I am so glad you are interested  in this, I can give <br/>\nyou a book list if you like.  I really enjoy our time  together, want another <br/>\ncup of tea or some *bean dip*.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17370,"nextTopicId":17399}}
