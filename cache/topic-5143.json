But they never had the tv on <br/>\nall day, either. That&#39;s because they had lots of other things to do - <br/>\nthey played dress-ups, for example, for hours and hours, when they were <br/>\nlittle. And we went to parks and the beach and children&#39;s museums and <br/>\nmany other places, a lot, too. And we have a swimming pool - they often <br/>\nspent 8 hours a day, for days in a row, in the pool when the weather <br/>\nwas good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think sitting in front of a tv for 8 hours a day, day after <br/>\nday, is good for little kids, either. If I noticed my child doing that, <br/>\nday after day, I&#39;d be concerned. But I think just pulling the plug is a <br/>\nwussy parental response. If the child is choosing tv, then that&#39;s the <br/>\nbest choice he/she has and that&#39;s the fault of the parents, not the <br/>\nkid. It is good information for the parent to know that the life <br/>\nthey&#39;re created is not as interesting as what is on tv. It is a <br/>\nparent&#39;s job to enrich a child&#39;s life. Pulling the plug doesn&#39;t enrich <br/>\na child&#39;s life, it reduces his/her options.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are VERY selective tv-watchers now - at 14, 17, and 20. They <br/>\nwatch West Wing - they get the old seasons from Netflix and watch every <br/>\nepisode over and over, as well as keep up on the new season. They&#39;re <br/>\nlearning HUGE amounts about politics and government and lots of bits of <br/>\na wide variety of other topics - like middle east geography or about <br/>\nnational land holdings, etc., whatever happens to be the topic on West <br/>\nWing. They also watch the Gilmore Girls pretty regularly - I know what <br/>\nthey like about it - it is an in-depth examination of what can go right <br/>\nand wrong in relationships between mothers and daughters and friends <br/>\nand lovers. They&#39;re critical of this show itself - sometimes they point <br/>\nout flaws in the writing, for example. And - there is much about the <br/>\nactual behavior of the characters in the show that they don&#39;t approve <br/>\nof (well - okay - they&#39;ve taken to referring to  more recent seasons as <br/>\n&quot;the Gilmore Sluts.&quot;). Those are the only two shows my 3 girls watch on <br/>\na fairly regular basis. Rosie and Roxana also watch something on <br/>\nNick-at-Night - Cosby Show, Roseanne, or whatever is on around 11 pm, <br/>\nmost nights. That is sort of their wind-down get-to-sleep routine. <br/>\nOther than those shows, they SELDOM turn on the tv - they&#39;re busy <br/>\npeople. My husband watches a LOT of soccer - international soccer. And <br/>\nhe watches movies - sometimes one of the rest of us watches his movies <br/>\nwith him, but he&#39;s far more willing to watch a mediocre movie than the <br/>\nrest of us - if we don&#39;t really like a movie, we find something else to <br/>\ndo - he sticks with it until the end. He&#39;s far far less picky.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband probably watches 10 to 20 times more tv than the other 4 of <br/>\nus put together.<br/>\nHe had no tv until he was 11 or 12 years old. Then he had just a little <br/>\nblack and white tv - he never SAW a color tv until he came to this <br/>\ncountry at about 23 years old. He loves it. We have a big-screen tv in <br/>\nthe living room. He turns it on just to see what&#39;s on. My kids NEVER <br/>\nturn it on just because they feel like watching tv - they turn it on to <br/>\nwatch a specific show and they turn it off when they&#39;re done watching <br/>\nthat show.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think back to the times we watched Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and a <br/>\nlot of PBS children&#39;s shows like Under the Umbrella Tree and The Puzzle <br/>\nPlace and Wishbone, etc., with great waves of nostalgia. Those were <br/>\nsome WONDERFUL tv shows that my children and my husband and I shared. <br/>\nGreat memories that we now share! But those memories are mixed in, too, <br/>\nwith extensive memories of them pretending that they were dolphins in <br/>\nthe swimming pool and making sandcastles at the beach and playing with <br/>\nplaydough on the patio and with fingerpaints in the bathtub and on and <br/>\non.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 16, 2005, at 5:04 PM, Aisling2u wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What about all the information that we have about how tv affects our<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s brain development, particularly in children under 2.

Some of them are just plain goofy. One fairly recent example -<br/>\nResult: A child&#39;s brainwaves show &quot;less activity&quot; when watching TV than when<br/>\nengaging in another activity. Deduced from: Comparing the relaxed and happy<br/>\ntv watcher with the &quot;other activity&quot; which turns out to be lying alone on a<br/>\nbed in a darkened room where the child might be bored, scared, irritated at<br/>\nthe waste of time, listening intently, making up stories in their mind - who<br/>\nknows? - but probably not relaxed and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey put on a tv in a room with nothing else to do and are judgmental when<br/>\nthe kid is drawn to the tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey put attractive, new programming on a tv in a room where the choice is<br/>\nwatch tv or play with some toys that are Waldorfy plain or probably<br/>\nfamiliar, or even what the kids already have at home. Kids in real homes<br/>\noften do both at once.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey grumble that kids find tv attractive when it is specifically and<br/>\ncleverly designed by the makers to appeal to kids. What, they should take a<br/>\nleaf out of school&#39;s book and deliberately make it boring?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey speak in a voice of doom when kids want to act out with action figures<br/>\nsome of the more violent or heroic stories they see on tv, instead of seeing<br/>\nthe acting out as *healthy* processing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey, they, they. Screw &#39;em. No one&#39;s Unschooling home, with free access to<br/>\ntv resembles any of the study environments. No one&#39;s Unschooled kids seem to<br/>\nexhibit one iota of harm in the long run from free access to tv.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Not to mention how ads affect them.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do ads affect your 2 year old? Jayn was a lot less interested in tv and<br/>\ndvd&#39;s when she was 2. Now at 5 her favorite shows are on channels without<br/>\nads for the most part - which is good luck for me I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that she sees things that she might like on ads. We will go and<br/>\nlook at them at the store if her interest continues. Sometimes she still<br/>\nwants them, other times not. We talk about ideas that are presented in both<br/>\nads and programming, especially when the behaviors exhibited are contrary to<br/>\nthe life of freedom and joy that we enjoy. For example parents in sit-coms<br/>\nare always grounding their kids, usually after the moral has been learned by<br/>\nthe kids. We talk about how dopey, sad and unproductive that is.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When you say they pretty much watch what they want I envision a <br/>\ntelevision that is on all day.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople first coming to Unschooling often have this kind of dichotomy of<br/>\nextremes in their minds. Not just with tv, people find it hard to see<br/>\nanything other than &lt;parental control/enforced limits&gt; or &lt;total dangerous<br/>\nchaos&gt;. The assumption behind this paradigm is that children will always<br/>\nchoose the negative or harmful or irresponsible alternative when choices are<br/>\noffered. The great thing about reading for longer on these lists is that<br/>\nanother picture of how these ideas work in real life replaces that paradigm<br/>\nof either/or. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the tv is on all day at our house, but usually because there is a<br/>\nshifting dynamic of who is utilizing it at different times. Sometimes it is<br/>\njust background; at others there is common consent, or Jayn-driven, desire<br/>\nfor quiet. Sometimes it is a &quot;movie marathon&quot; - repeated showings of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nlatest dvd acquisition, or a recorded series. <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I agree that watching with them so you can <br/>\nanswer questions is wonderful - turning it off is even better!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a judgment of &quot;better&quot; should probably be done in a context rather<br/>\nthan as an absolute.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example turning it off when no-one is watching it might be better than<br/>\nleaving it on in an empty room and burning electricity.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurning it off is better than leaving it on when everyone wants to turn it<br/>\noff - as against forcing people to watch tv if they don&#39;t want to. (Like<br/>\nthat would ever happen??? See the movie &quot;Matilda&quot; for a lighthearted take on<br/>\nthat very occurrence.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTurning it off is not better when someone else is trying to watch something,<br/>\nor is enjoying having it on. Turning it off is not better if it is a coerced<br/>\naction. Turning it off is not better if the result is resentment or<br/>\nwistfulness. <br/>\n<br/>\nTurning it off is not better if watching tv together is very important to<br/>\nyour child right now, and by watching with them you are showing your trust<br/>\nin them, and approval of their interests. It might however be better than<br/>\nwatching with a disapproving or critical attitude, or one that disparages<br/>\nthe shows, although taking yourself away could be a &quot;better&quot; alternative in<br/>\nthat situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that you are using the phrase &quot;turn it off&quot; as code for &quot;do<br/>\nsomething else together&quot;. Nothing will make your kid resent an activity than<br/>\nbeing forced to do it against their true free will, or being manipulated<br/>\ninto it, even if gently, by parental judgments. If you want them to join you<br/>\nin some other activity one answer is to do it yourself with your own honest,<br/>\nnot exaggerated, enjoyment, making being with you attractive and full of<br/>\nlove.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I looked at the article about the marmite blob, and had to chuckle. Jayn<br/>\nwould probably be amused or curious; without having actually seen &quot;The Blob&quot;<br/>\nwould miss part of the joke. However she is 5. I don&#39;t know how she would<br/>\nhave reacted when a toddler. Usually she would leave or turn away if<br/>\nsomething was unattractive for any reason. Older - she asked for fast<br/>\nforward or skipping the scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 3/11/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] TV question","postDate":"1111034457","msgId":5163,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzE2LjIxNDA1OC4yNDI0LjE3LmRkemltbGV3QGp1bm8uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5161,"nextInTopic":5164,"prevInTime":5162,"nextInTime":5164,"topicId":5143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I agree that watching with them so you can answer questions is wonderful - turning it off is even better!*** I would be hurt and sad if someone turned off","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-881861007\">***I agree that watching with them so you can <br/>\nanswer questions is wonderful - turning it off is even better!***<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be hurt and sad if someone turned off my TV when I was watching. <br/>\nI&#39;d feel like they didn&#39;t care what I wanted or care about what was<br/>\nimportant to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never take my husband&#39;s old &#39;64 Chevy truck away from him and I<br/>\nbet I could find a lot of statistics about motor vehicle accidents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t take his fly rod away even though he&#39;s been injured while<br/>\nfishing and even chased into the Little Blackfoot by a bear!

Probably there are brain studies but the survivors<br/>\nI knew lived out normal lives and were fine people. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t even know a fraction of the truth about the human brain and yet<br/>\nlots of people believe electronic media will harm our children more than<br/>\nsay, a parent hitting a kid, a kid being sent to bed without supper, a<br/>\nkid being drugged into compliance,  a kid being punished by being<br/>\nconfined to one room, having possessions taken away, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy own studies indicate (I&#39;ve studied one kid for almost thirteen<br/>\nyears&lt;g&gt;) that a kid who watches TV is ok.   If the kid wasn&#39;t ok, I<br/>\nwould examine relationship issues with mom and dad, general health,<br/>\nhappiness, etc., before I&#39;d assume the problem was caused by TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan will be thirteen soon and so far brain development seems to be okey<br/>\ndokey.  He&#39;s having no problems learning or doing any of the things he<br/>\nwants to learn and do.  He&#39;s smarter and better informed than a lot of<br/>\nadults I know. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Not to mention how ads affect them.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the most interesting thing for me to watch.  Dylan loved TV<br/>\ncommercials.  He spent some little while thinking all that stuff was true<br/>\nand we talked about advertising and we went out and bought some stuff<br/>\njust to see if it was what the ad said it was. <br/>\nWe were sometimes pleasantly surprised and sometimes we were smugly happy<br/>\nto have discovered their deception. <br/>\nHe became very aware of the techniques advertisers use to stimulate our<br/>\ninterests and create a feeling of need for the product. He loves the<br/>\npsychology of advertising.   He&#39;s the most careful shopper I know and has<br/>\nlooked up consumer reports on more than one higher priced item when he<br/>\nwas considering a purchase.   He will probably never be an impulse buyer<br/>\nand probably make few purchases he regrets.  That happened because he was<br/>\nfree to see ads and commercials and had time to experiment and consider. <br/>\n I&#39;m so glad he got to think about these things at an early age because I<br/>\nthink it means he&#39;ll be less likely to spend his rent money on some<br/>\nimpulsive purchase when he&#39;s on his own.  His ability to fool around with<br/>\nadvertising and buying happened when he was young and he didn&#39;t stand to<br/>\nlose his home or car or stereo system.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur experience has been that TV is not a problem.  Dylan has had no TV<br/>\nrestrictions.  He was not really interested in TV when he was very small.<br/>\n I think he began watching with real interest during a TNT Monster Vision<br/>\nBash marathon of Godzilla movies when he was four, or so.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119145590,"authorName":"April M","from":"&quot;April M&quot; &lt;abmorris23@...&gt;","profile":"klkb624","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] TV question","postDate":"1111025389","msgId":5161,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5IQkJLT1BDS0xHR0NQQUlOREpESUVPRkhFQUEuYWJtb3JyaXMyM0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwMy1EQVY3NTdERDFCNEM2RURCQUIxREFFNkVGRjQ5MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":5160,"nextInTopic":5163,"prevInTime":5160,"nextInTime":5162,"topicId":5143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids have always had access to the TV, the youngest completely from birth...and they are all savvy consumers not influenced by ads...actually, the youngest","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2142472753\">My kids have always had access to the TV, the youngest completely from<br/>\nbirth...and they are all savvy consumers not influenced by ads...actually,<br/>\nthe youngest is quite convinced that reality is the opposite of commercials!<br/>\nNone of my kids seem to have any brain development problems.....they all<br/>\nknow how to turn the TV off if they want.

LOL!!  But I can see <br/>\nhow a child could feel uneasy about it.  How much do you have <br/>\nto &quot;protect&quot; your child?  That&#39;s hard to tell a parent.  Children <br/>\nare generally going to watch those things that interest them.  <br/>\nYounger children are going to be more interested (generally) in <br/>\nDora, Blue&#39;s Clues, PBS kids shows, etc.  Older kids are going to <br/>\ndiversify according to their interests.
