You left him ... you asked him to come and he wasn&#39;t in a place that he could stop what he was doing and come along and you left!   I am of course never saying that you would have really left him as in left the building but to him it was very real.. he was lost!   You were gone!   He had to go and ask a stranger to help him instead of the person he knew and trusted !   He was at a stage that he needed you to be there with him for him to explore and take it all in... your need was to move things along and communication broke down!   It may be that his fear that something will happen to you is him expressing in a &quot;safe&quot; way that when you left his trust was so shattered he just KNEW something bad had to have happened to you because you would never leave him on purpose!   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow deep breath... ouch ..stretch your toes that I just stepped on!   Perhaps you could begin to rebuild his trust by having a conversation before you go somewhere about how long you have that you can be in that place... what you intend to do at that location and suggest things he might like to look at too... give him some time and let him move as far away as he is comfortable.   Make sure to remind him of where you are ... I often will say to one of mine ... I am stepping one aisle over to get dish soap.. do you want to come along or stay here ?   Or I need to get something somewhere else can you finish up in a few minutes or do you want to come with me and then come back if you need more time?   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are times when I really need to do something quickly...  I can&#39;t spend hours looking around at different things so I say that before getting out of the car.   I might show my 7 yr old on my watch that we have 10 minutes to do this errand and put him in charge of making sure we stick to that time.    Sometimes no one is happy we don&#39;t have more time... validate that feeling of disappointment and find a way to return or meet that need in some other way.  We don&#39;t always have hours we can spend trolling around in a store but I think we can all agree we all have &quot;that&quot; place that we could spend hours and hours and never get tired of being there (bead stores and book stores come to mind for me!)  My husband could spend eternity in electronics stores... my eyelashes begin to ache from boredom after about 3 1/2 minutes but he LOVES it... I have to change my mindset in those instances and look at it as spending time WITH him not IN an electronics store.    <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are going to have to do some honest talking with your son... apologize for breaking his trust and leaving him and then begin working on a way to meet his need and your need.   Start over on building that autonomy he used to have... you built that in him before so you know how to do it... you just had a small stumble because you got frustrated and allowed mainstream thinking to seep in!     <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, <br/>\nLisa B  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Wendy&quot; &lt;islandwitch@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 12 year old son has been attached at the hip, so to speak, for 2 years. it all started at walmart.

I started by leaving her for 15 minutes at a time.I let her know I had my phone if she really needed me.This gave her reassurance that if there was an emergency I could get ahold  her. When I return I let her know that everything is fine. Each time I made it alittle longer. With her being able to call me if needed made her feel alittle better. I still have problems with her, atleast now I can get a break for even a few minuts.
