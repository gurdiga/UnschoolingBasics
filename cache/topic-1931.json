After she was born, I decided that I was not going to teach her the &quot;magic word&quot;, and never tell her to/insist she say &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot;. Not because I don&#39;t care about other people, as it may look on the surface. But because I sat with the idea, and it just FELT right.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe now spontaneously says &quot;please&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, and &quot;you&#39;re welcome&quot;, ONLY because it is how my husband and I interact with each other, other people, and her. She does not say it every single time yet, but to hear her say &quot;Oh! Thank you!&quot; when she is given a gift, or something to eat, or I help her adjust her chair or her shirt so it&#39;s more comfortable, is all the proof I need that modeling works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see why it is a difficult concept to grasp. I don&#39;t want to sound like I never had any doubts, because I did, but I followed my intuition. <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nTracy A.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1909,"nextTopicId":1939}}
