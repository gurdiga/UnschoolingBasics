What if the child asks for instruction?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry I just keep reading this and have this image of little Junior<br/>\ncoming up to Mama.<br/>\n&quot;I say Mater, I feel an inadequacy in my abilities. Will you vouchsafe to<br/>\nafford me some instruction in this area?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe serious answer for me is &quot;yes the forcing is the key issue to be<br/>\navoided. Also manipulating, judging and negating&quot;. However one of the<br/>\nproblems with the concept of lessons is the idea that you have to start at<br/>\nthe beginning, work through, and then reach the end, and presto you have<br/>\nlearnt something. Natural learning happens more like jumping around a web<br/>\nthan zooming down one fixed highway. (Brief periods may be spent on the<br/>\nhighway, but the &quot;exits&quot; are limitless)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most children who are unschooling sometimes ask for help with<br/>\nspecific tasks, and often want to enroll in classes in something outside of<br/>\nthe home like dance, sports or music. What keeps it unschooling is the<br/>\nabsolute freedom to give these up at will when the child has learnt enough<br/>\nfor themselves, or if they discover that it is not what they want after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is asking for &quot;instruction&quot; in the way I&#39;m guessing you mean it<br/>\n(I may be wrong) - a kind of sequential program to learn something, it may<br/>\nbe that they are still DE-schooling. They have not yet rediscovered that<br/>\nthey can trust themselves and their own abilities to learn. They have been<br/>\ndamaged by the school system, but they will heal. In that situation, I would<br/>\nsuggest acclaiming the idea of &quot;it&#39;s still vacation! Yay&quot; And then strewing<br/>\nlots of interesting things about.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are coming up with &quot;I need you to teach me how to read&quot;, it may be<br/>\nthat first they need a safe place to express some frustration, and then some<br/>\nideas from you then and there. I would avoid taking that as a blanket<br/>\nrequest for instituting a whole reading program - unless you find some that<br/>\nyour kid is loving - in which case the same thinking applies as to the<br/>\noutside classes: freedom to quit at any time without rancour.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
