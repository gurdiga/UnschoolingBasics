I, too, am at the beginning of the unschooling journey (ds1 is 5 yrs and ds2 is 2 yrs).  I find myself doing exactly what you described and thinking what you thought.  What I have decided to do is walk away.  If what my children are doing is driving me crazy then I walk away.  The other thing that I do is have a talk with myself before I bring out whatever it is.  I tell myself that no matter what they do, I will not freak out and if I am feeling crazy by how they are using the supplies then I will walk away.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWalking away helps to diffuse my emotions and keeps me from going crazy on the children.  After a while I will begin to see that they are doing really neat things that reflect them rather than me.  The other thing I do is jump in and use the supplies in the way that I want to use them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel that we have to be patient with ourselves on this journey.  I believe that the more guilt we have and the more we beat ourselves up for our mistakes, the more difficult it will be for us to embrace unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that you are definitely not alone and I believe that you need to believe in you more.  If it was not this it would be something else if your girls were in school.  No matter our family&#39;s lifestyle, we are going to make mistakes.  The problem is not in the mistake, it is in feeling guilty and not correcting the mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad that you were honest with the group as many of us are going through very similar situations.  I wish you all the best and know that you will end up being a great unschooling advocate.

It&#39;s an ongoing <br/>\n&gt; process that takes time to evolve.  That&#39;s the beauty of it....you <br/>\n&gt; never stop learning and growing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I think - I&#39;m NOT cut out for this.

They are still so <br/>\n&gt; young....and resilient.  I have apologized to my 12 yo dd many <br/>\n&gt; times <br/>\n&gt; for things that I did &quot;before unschooling,&quot; and she has never <br/>\n&gt; remembered even ONE incident that I described.  She has said <br/>\n&gt; things <br/>\n&gt; like, &quot;Geez Mom, I don&#39;t remember that....and even if you did do <br/>\n&gt; it <br/>\n&gt; (or say it), I know you didn&#39;t know any better....you would never <br/>\n&gt; do <br/>\n&gt; anything to hurt us on purpose.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Believe me, I am as anal retentive as they come (but I am <br/>\n&gt; recovering :)  When you described the stamp kit scenario, I could <br/>\n&gt; totally relate to your feelings.  May I suggest that, for a while, <br/>\n&gt; you forget about things like planned projects, unless both you and <br/>\n&gt; your children totally enjoy them.  Just focus on the really simple <br/>\n&gt; stuff.  If they like videos, TV, playing games, just being silly <br/>\n&gt; with <br/>\n&gt; you -- go with it.  It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t do one darned <br/>\n&gt; &quot;productive&quot; <br/>\n&gt; thing all day.  The more relaxed Mom is -- the more relaxed the <br/>\n&gt; kids <br/>\n&gt; will be.  Soon it will all come together and you&#39;ll feel a &quot;flow&quot; <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; your days.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please be encouraged that there are many others who&#39;ve felt the <br/>\n&gt; same <br/>\n&gt; way you do right now.  You are SOO far ahead of the game though, <br/>\n&gt; because you have the ability to recognize and see the need for <br/>\n&gt; change <br/>\n&gt; in yourself.

I have 5 kids myself.  I know the destruction that learning can entail.  It doesn&#39;t stress me but my poor dh will almost have a heart attack trying not to freak out &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helps us is that small kids have free and ready access to rough and tumble things that can &quot;take it&quot; or a set of things specially for them (like a less expensive but still very fun stamp set.)  The kids have their own stamps that they can play with as they choose but if they want to use my stamps (the one without all the colors mixed together &lt;grin&gt;), I ask that they allow me to help out and I am then still doing gentle reminders about treating things gently....but I don&#39;t feel guilty because the kids are free to use their own stamps any way they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may just be me....but it sounded to me as though you had a &quot;currier and ives&quot; moment all planned in your head....you and the girls happily stamping aways, gently handling things, placing them back in their proper places....and then reality hit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRelax, baby steps.  Think back over today.  If you hit some rough spots, play them over in your head, see where things went wrong, replay it with a happier, gentler script.  Then tomorrow, when your girls ask if they can do something, try everyway possible to say yes...see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:alder7run@...\">alder7run@...</a><br/>\nDate: Thursday, January 5, 2006 2:27 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Discouraged - long<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was sitting depressed in the other room, and I thought, &quot;Why <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t I go <br/>\n&gt; bounce these feelings off of the wonderful folks at &quot;Always <br/>\n&gt; Unschooled&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and &quot;Unschooling Basics&quot;? So, here I am. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As we pursue this way of life, I continue to be faced with how <br/>\n&gt; uptight I <br/>\n&gt; am. I feel so stuck and find myself sometimes envious of the <br/>\n&gt; people who <br/>\n&gt; have not seen the truth that I feel that unschooling is. That <br/>\n&gt; sounds <br/>\n&gt; silly, but it&#39;s true. It seems I know people confident in their <br/>\n&gt; authoritative parenting rolling along, AND I am learning to know <br/>\n&gt; people <br/>\n&gt; alive and celebrating the freedom and joy that radical unschooling <br/>\n&gt; is. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; feeling alone in the camp of highly sensitve, controlling, uptight <br/>\n&gt; people <br/>\n&gt; who want the joy and freedom and everything that radical <br/>\n&gt; unschooling can <br/>\n&gt; mean for my children (and my whole family) but I am feeling <br/>\n&gt; incapable of <br/>\n&gt; carrying it out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Latest example:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I got a huge stamping set for my girls and me for Christmas. It <br/>\n&gt; comes with <br/>\n&gt; lots of stamps, stamp pads, special markers, colored pencils and <br/>\n&gt; blank <br/>\n&gt; cards. We got it out today, and I&#39;m pretty sure that by the end I <br/>\n&gt; had <br/>\n&gt; eliminated every possible bit of joy that could come from it. I <br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want them pressing too hard with the special markers (afterall we <br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; plenty of other markers for that). I didn&#39;t want them mixing the <br/>\n&gt; colors of <br/>\n&gt; the stamp pads. Then we wouldn&#39;t have any pads left that were one <br/>\n&gt; clean <br/>\n&gt; color. I didn&#39;t want them using every single stamp just to see <br/>\n&gt; what it <br/>\n&gt; looked like, because then I would have to figure out how to clean <br/>\n&gt; all of <br/>\n&gt; them (and I don&#39;t even know how to do that yet - feel free to <br/>\n&gt; offer tips). <br/>\n&gt; UGH! I literally could not stop myself. The girls were each crying <br/>\n&gt; at some <br/>\n&gt; point, and they eventually gave up and left. Can you blame them? <br/>\n&gt; Then I <br/>\n&gt; think - I&#39;m NOT cut out for this. If only someone else could <br/>\n&gt; unschool my <br/>\n&gt; daughters. I&#39;m only getting in the way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is just one example. I don&#39;t want to be like this. I try to <br/>\n&gt; tell <br/>\n&gt; myself to ease up. These things do not matter, but the practical <br/>\n&gt; mind <br/>\n&gt; overrules with things like &quot;but if we don&#39;t use this properly we <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have it to use at all later on.&quot; Even my body locks up - shoulders <br/>\n&gt; droop <br/>\n&gt; and hunch forward, my heart beats harder, and I even start shaking <br/>\n&gt; slightly. (This is if I try not to respond the way in my <br/>\n&gt; controlling way.) <br/>\n&gt; I practice yoga and feel so calm and enlightened - hah! Then I <br/>\n&gt; interact <br/>\n&gt; with my children and revert to being some kind of controlling nut. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I sound like a complete nut too, and normally I would not <br/>\n&gt; even <br/>\n&gt; show this side of myself for fear of what others would think of <br/>\n&gt; me. If you <br/>\n&gt; met me in real life I would appear quite friendly and even calm. <br/>\n&gt; That is a <br/>\n&gt; part of me too. But, for my children&#39;s sake, I have to fess up to <br/>\n&gt; this <br/>\n&gt; other side of me.<br/>\n&gt; Did any of you start from this place? What helped you? How did you <br/>\n&gt; progress? I think I need to hear that I can do it, and school is <br/>\n&gt; NOT a <br/>\n&gt; better place for my children to be. That&#39;s what I immediately <br/>\n&gt; start to <br/>\n&gt; think - &quot;Who am I to think I can do better than the schools? I <br/>\n&gt; have the <br/>\n&gt; vision but none of the personality.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Could one of you adopt us for a while, so I can learn a different <br/>\n&gt; way of <br/>\n&gt; being? : ) I feel as though I&#39;m trying to live on another planet <br/>\n&gt; whose way <br/>\n&gt; of life seems much closer to what I want, but I am just not <br/>\n&gt; catching on to <br/>\n&gt; the fundamental qualities of their lives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you to any who take the time to read this and respond.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gayle           (mom to Faye 5 and Annika 3 1/2)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Give them some things like: measuring cups, spoons, small  <br/>\nbowls, funnels, suction thingies (basters), egg beaters, popsicle  <br/>\nsticks, paint brushes of different sizes. Let them play - your job is  <br/>\nto sit nearby, reading a book, and just keeping enough eye on them to  <br/>\nmake sure they don&#39;t get hurt by standing up and slipping/falling.  <br/>\nOtherwise, all you do is &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aah&quot; if they show you their  <br/>\ncreations. They will get pudding in their hair, on the walls, on the  <br/>\nshower curtain or door if you have one. They&#39;ll be sitting in it and  <br/>\nthey will probably eat some. ALL OKAY. SMILE!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you think they&#39;re getting close to be done - wash all the  <br/>\npudding down the drain, wipe off walls, etc. Give them nice big  <br/>\nsponges to help with the clean up.

In terms of stamps she is far<br/>\nmore likely to be interested in the kind of stamp that is self inking, or<br/>\nhow household items look when converted to use as stamps. She had little<br/>\nconcept of being cautious or careful with things like markers, although now<br/>\n- at 6 and with very strong fine motor skills always - is very keen on<br/>\ndrawing with very fine point mechanical pencils and pens (instead of the fat<br/>\nmarkers of yore).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess one thing that I am adding to my earlier thoughts about the concept<br/>\nof &quot;properly&quot; is that choosing an activity that seems bound to end in<br/>\nfrustration for the kids looks like a &quot;trigger&quot; for your control stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bit like getting out the chess set for the first time and expecting<br/>\nthe 3 year old to want to learn all the moves and play the game.

I feel so stuck and find myself sometimes envious of the people who <br/>\nhave not seen the truth that I feel that unschooling is. That sounds <br/>\nsilly, but it&#39;s true. It seems I know people confident in their <br/>\nauthoritative parenting rolling along, AND I am learning to know people <br/>\nalive and celebrating the freedom and joy that radical unschooling is. I&#39;m <br/>\nfeeling alone in the camp of highly sensitve, controlling, uptight people <br/>\nwho want the joy and freedom and everything that radical unschooling can <br/>\nmean for my children (and my whole family) but I am feeling incapable of <br/>\ncarrying it out. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a bit of a ramble, but I hope it helps...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was first embracing Unschooling, even first embracing homeschooling<br/>\nat all, it was very important to me and my serenity, to remove myself from<br/>\nnegativity coming from other people. At first that meant people invested in<br/>\nthe school system if they made negative comments about homeschooled<br/>\nchildren. <br/>\n<br/>\nLater I came to the realization that I couldn&#39;t do any school conversations<br/>\n- still can&#39;t. These kinds of conversations - especially when I feel<br/>\ndefensive - leave me feeling pain. I try to avoid the conversations by<br/>\nvarious tactics including physically walking away, and not accepting<br/>\ninvitations. I just gently stopped calling some people who I realized were<br/>\nnot going to add to the ease or joy in our lives. In this way the happy<br/>\nUnschoolers became more of a feature and influence in my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf other people are contributing your distress, or causing you to make<br/>\ncomparisons, it might be better to limit their time in your life until you<br/>\nare stronger in Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a whole different vibe and mood that comes from people who are<br/>\ngenuinely interested in learning something about Unschooling or what an<br/>\nUnschooling take on a learning or behavioral issue might be. I can usually<br/>\ntell the difference between that kind of conversation and the kind of<br/>\nquestion that has scoffing, disbelief or downright hostility underlying it -<br/>\njudgmental statements masquerading as questions. I have let go of my desire<br/>\nto fight for my position, and answer briefly with &quot;We do this...&quot;<br/>\nstatements. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I annoyed someone (stranger at a kid&#39;s birthday party) whose first<br/>\nquestion on hearing that we homeschool was &quot;How do you get her to listen to<br/>\nyou?&quot; by instantly replying &quot;I try to say something worth listening to.&quot; I<br/>\nthought she meant listen in general. She got this look of utter irritation<br/>\non her face and started on about what a discipline problem her 7yo son was<br/>\nand how much more difficult it would be to have to keep his attention on<br/>\nschool subjects and make him work at home. What she was really asking was<br/>\n&quot;How do you make your dd do her work?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe paradigms we live under are so broadly apart from the mainstream that<br/>\neven the language doesn&#39;t cross over - we use the same words and have<br/>\ndifferent meanings. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet of all the children at the birthday party Jayn was the one who came up<br/>\nto me a couple of times just to give me a quick kiss and say what fun she<br/>\nwas having. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo that brings me to an idea I would like you to think on some more. RU is<br/>\nabout making the relationship between you the *primary* concern - actively<br/>\nas well as mentally. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese people who are authoritarian etc are probably not making the<br/>\nrelationship with their children the primary concern. They may believe they<br/>\nare in their minds, but that is probably not what their actions are showing<br/>\nto their own children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m taking your words to mean that you are feeling uptight and controlling<br/>\nand feeling at the mercy of your emotions and desire to control. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that you are at the threshold of letting go of these negative<br/>\nfeelings - I mean feeling the tension of being sooooo close to a<br/>\nbreakthrough. Your very dissatisfaction with yourself right now is<br/>\nindicative of an impending shift. You can try asking yourself whether what<br/>\nyou are about to say will enhance the relationship you have with your<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;UGH! I literally could not stop myself. The girls were each crying at<br/>\nsome point, and they eventually gave up and left. Can you blame them? Then I<br/>\n<br/>\nthink - I&#39;m NOT cut out for this. If only someone else could unschool my <br/>\ndaughters. I&#39;m only getting in the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is just one example. I don&#39;t want to be like this. I try to tell <br/>\nmyself to ease up. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that you are focusing on the idea of &quot;stopping&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot;,<br/>\nnegative words towards yourself that mirror the stop/don&#39;t words that you<br/>\nare putting out towards your daughters. You are creating a Void therefore<br/>\nthat needs filling (&quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot; as some one said). This is like<br/>\nusing the phrase &quot;don&#39;t run&quot; instead of &quot;please walk&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need some new positive action mental scripts that give you an<br/>\nalternative thought to stop/don&#39;t/ease up. &quot;Ease up&quot; is way too vague anyway<br/>\nand is the result rather than the action.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use the internal phrases &quot;Breathe...wait...how can I show her I love her?&quot;<br/>\nto counter rising stress - and it works really well for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT these may not be what you need (although I think everyone benefits from<br/>\n&quot;Breathe&quot;!) Maybe you need a Question to ask yourself in these moments like<br/>\n&quot;What am I feeling? Is it really important?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need a reminder to Observe, by saying to yourself &quot;How is my dd<br/>\nfeeling right now?&quot;, or even &quot;What is great about what she is doing?&quot;; &quot;Are<br/>\nthey having fun?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need to say to yourself &quot;It is OK to be quiet and give them their<br/>\nprocess&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need to say &quot;Count to 20&quot;, and then repeat if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; These things do not matter, but the practical mind <br/>\noverrules with things like &quot;but if we don&#39;t use this properly we won&#39;t <br/>\nhave it to use at all later on.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like a scarcity paradigm creeping up on you - maybe it would<br/>\nhelp for you to pin point the source - childhood deprivation? Your mother&#39;s<br/>\nvoice? Try to discover what the big deal is about &quot;properly&quot; for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHear the words in your mind and counter them with a reality check Mantra -<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s just $x worth of paint&quot;; &quot;Everything is repairable&quot;; &quot;It&#39;s only a toy&quot;<br/>\n- or try an Abundance Affirmation &quot;We can get more&quot;; &quot;We have enough for all<br/>\nour needs&quot;; &quot;Experiments are good&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Even my body locks up - shoulders droop <br/>\nand hunch forward, my heart beats harder, and I even start shaking <br/>\nslightly. (This is if I try not to respond the way in my controlling<br/>\nway.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood clue that there is likely an undealt-with childhood trauma/experience<br/>\nin your soul - maybe even lurking beyond memory. I wonder if you were told<br/>\nto &quot;control yourself&quot; a lot when little, or conversely that &quot;you had no<br/>\nself-control&quot; a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an exercise for you to try that is kinda fun, and a good thought<br/>\nstretch. I read about the concept somewhere, created the writing exercise<br/>\nfor myself, and found it to be really great for me to discern the cause of<br/>\nmy stress. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou take the body part that is feeling the pain or tension and write out all<br/>\nthe colloquial metaphors you can think of that use the name of the body part<br/>\nand what they mean, including contradictions. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an ongoing list of &quot;Back&quot; phrases such as &quot;Back breaking work&quot; being<br/>\n&quot;very hard physical labor&quot;; &quot;Back out&quot;, &quot;Back stabbing&quot;, &quot;Spineless&quot;, &quot;Bend<br/>\nover backwards&quot;  etc. It helped me realize that I was having more than usual<br/>\nstress induced back pain when what I wanted to do was &quot;back out&quot; of an<br/>\nobligation that had become onerous but I had fears about being seen as<br/>\n&quot;turning my back on&quot; someone. See how it works?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might try that with your body. For Example for your Shoulders: &quot;have the<br/>\nworld on your shoulders&quot; could mean &quot;carrying a too heavy burden, also the<br/>\nsense of martyrdom&quot; (see also &quot;shoulder the burden&quot;); &quot;shoulder to the<br/>\nwheel&quot; means &quot;working hard with determination&quot;; &quot;Giving the cold shoulder&quot;<br/>\nmeans &quot;turning away, shunning, showing a superior attitude&quot;. Keep going<br/>\nuntil something rings true.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I practice yoga and feel so calm and enlightened - hah! Then I interact<br/>\n<br/>\nwith my children and revert to being some kind of controlling nut. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally I just want to add that if there is some activity that always pushes<br/>\nyour button, especially if the root of the angst continues to elude you, it<br/>\nreally is ok to sometimes step back and leave them to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of an art activity as an example, it might be better not to try<br/>\nto participate, but to wait nearby to view the wonderful results, rather<br/>\nthan sour the whole process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was kinda like that with Jayn&#39;s desire to pour water out of the bathtub<br/>\nonto the floor. She really seemed to need to do it, and it bugged the heck<br/>\nout of me. I decided that the battle wasn&#39;t adding to our joy, so I set out<br/>\ntowels and waited within earshot in the next room. (I add that she was old<br/>\nenough to sit in the tub safely by this time.) <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;Who am I to think I can do better than the schools? I have the <br/>\nvision but none of the personality.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n:P~~~~~~ to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBetter than schools is a pretty meager goal. Every day your kids don&#39;t have<br/>\nto rush their breakfast you are doing better than going to school. Schools<br/>\nare not as good as a loving parent at being a loving parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have the personality of a school? So much the better. (g)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I feel as though I&#39;m trying to live on another planet whose way <br/>\nof life seems much closer to what I want &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this is an idea I can get behind. Unschoolers do often seem to be living<br/>\non another planet. Read some of Anne Ohman&#39;s stuff - she talks about the<br/>\n&quot;view from here&quot; being different.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re new here. You&#39;ll feel more comfortable real soon, if you stick out<br/>\nacclimatizing. Right now you still have some Jet Lag. It will get better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

If they like videos, TV, playing games, just being silly with <br/>\nyou -- go with it.  It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t do one darned &quot;productive&quot; <br/>\nthing all day.  The more relaxed Mom is -- the more relaxed the kids <br/>\nwill be.  Soon it will all come together and you&#39;ll feel a &quot;flow&quot; to <br/>\nyour days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease be encouraged that there are many others who&#39;ve felt the same <br/>\nway you do right now.  You are SOO far ahead of the game though, <br/>\nbecause you have the ability to recognize and see the need for change <br/>\nin yourself.

I  was <br/>\nso busy this year (husband overseas) and my mom said she would make cookies  <br/>\nwith the kids.  She was so controlling and in such a rush to get it done,  that <br/>\nmy son quit after about a minute.  My daughter hung in there, but they  were <br/>\nstarting to battle wills.  I remembered being a little girl in the  same <br/>\nsituation, not getting it right and not getting to experiment and having to  do it <br/>\nmom&#39;s way and on mom&#39;s timeschedule.    And I could  see how I am just like her!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t follow directions well and are impulsive, so it has been hard  <br/>\nfor me to do things with them.  I find it best to let them explore on their  <br/>\nown.  We are just now getting where it is easier....today my daughter and I  <br/>\nmade a pie!  That is huge for me on so many levels, but she is also more  <br/>\nwilling to follow instructions (watch the hot pot while you stir, etc.).   So maybe <br/>\nthere are just some things that you don&#39;t do RIGHT NOW.  As they  grow and you <br/>\nwork on your controlling a bit at a time, you&#39;ll be able to do  more and more <br/>\ntogether.  Also, try to set up the environment for your peace  of mind.  My <br/>\nkids do a lot of painting and messy stuff outside!<br/>\n <br/>\nA side note, my mom bought my daughter lots of really nice art supplies for  <br/>\nChristmas.  She talked to the owner of the art shop for a long time.   His <br/>\nsuggestion was to only give a couple of colors at a time and a couple of  <br/>\nmaterials at a time so the child can experience the joy of creating without the  pain <br/>\nof the brown, muddy mess.  This might not work in all situations, but  <br/>\nsomething to think about.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also like what Ren said about being in the moment.  Sometimes when I  am <br/>\nflustered I think &quot;I can&#39;t change what is happening now, this is as it  is&quot;.  <br/>\nThis helps me move past the resistance and what &quot;should be&quot; and get  on to <br/>\naddressing the issue as it is.  Such a small thing but such a huge  difference in <br/>\nmy reaction.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope you can forgive yourself and know that no one could unschool your  <br/>\nkids like you do, you are their mom and they love you for you.....warts, control  <br/>\nissues and all!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC, running off to check out Ren&#39;s  list!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Discouraged - long","postDate":"1136499299","msgId":8758,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwazVwMytwcDRxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PE9GRTZCNzY5NDEuQzdDQUQyMTEtT044NTI1NzBFRC4wMDZERTk3My04NTI1NzBFRC4wMDcwNzUxREBsb2NhbGRvbWFpbj4="},"prevInTopic":8757,"nextInTopic":8759,"prevInTime":8757,"nextInTime":8759,"topicId":8755,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gayle....

I understand the &quot;controlling&quot; feeling as well-<br/>\n(yep, I&#39;m a controller too) and you&#39;re right- it almost always comes<br/>\nwith disastrous consequences! It&#39;s not an easy thing to change, since<br/>\nat least part of it is your inborn personality. BUT, you have an<br/>\nadvantage- you see that you have this issue, and you want to do<br/>\nsomething about it. It will be hard, but you CAN DO IT! (Just think of<br/>\nother people that don&#39;t have your insightfulness, and go about<br/>\nthinking that controlling their children is the right thing to do!)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to address your exmaple with the stamp set, perhaps you could get<br/>\nan inexpensive stamp set for your kids to play with, uninhibited. Let<br/>\nthem explore it, mix the colors, etc, and see what happens. They will<br/>\nprobably realize on their own quite quickly what happens when the<br/>\ncolors are mixed. Don&#39;t you remember the watercolor boxes in<br/>\nelementary school? It always made me mad to open a box that had all<br/>\nbrown paints because someone had mixed them together. I learned not to<br/>\ndo that all on my own. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you stick with that thought, that they will learn from their own<br/>\nexperiences, and you let go of the perfectionism, your life will be so<br/>\nmuch easier. Your shoulders will relax and you will start to feel the<br/>\njoy of their learning experience- because it has to be THEIR<br/>\nexperience. (As much as we want to protect them from mistakes, big and<br/>\nsmall, the lesson still has to be theirs, or they won&#39;t truly<br/>\nappreciate it) I have learned to give my kids more responsibility, and<br/>\nin turn they have learned that they need to think harder about their<br/>\nchoices- because they don&#39;t want to make the wrong choice! <br/>\n<br/>\nPractice your yoga, breathe through your desire to control their<br/>\nactivities, and ENJOY their discoveries- watch their happy little<br/>\nfaces as they experience life! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps- please don&#39;t beat yourself up- life is too short to<br/>\nbe so stressed out!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin<br/>\nMom to Alex (14) Haley (11) & Rachel (9)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was sitting depressed in the other room, and I thought, &quot;Why don&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I go <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bounce these feelings off of the wonderful folks at &quot;Always Unschooled&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and &quot;Unschooling Basics&quot;?
