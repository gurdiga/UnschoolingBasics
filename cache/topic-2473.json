And, I believe it does<br/>\n&gt; have a chapter on why you should not spank.  (Of<br/>\n&gt; course I would never spank someone else&#39;s child!) <br/>\n&gt; When I was pregnant with our first child and I<br/>\n&gt; mentioned how we should never spank, I was horrified<br/>\n&gt; to hear my partner disagreeing with me for after all,<br/>\n&gt; that was how he was raised!  Well, yeah, so was I!  My<br/>\n&gt; grandmother would smack us with a fly swatter or<br/>\n&gt; wooden spoon, sometimes for , really, no reason.  My<br/>\n&gt; memory of kindergarten (in public school of course)<br/>\n&gt; was being spanked on my butt in front of the class by<br/>\n&gt; my teacher with a ruler, for what?  Tapping my pencil<br/>\n&gt; on my workbook- and not stopping when she told me too.<br/>\n&gt;  *Alas* perhaps the origins of my anti-authoritarian<br/>\n&gt; mindset.  I also have a clear memory of being spanked<br/>\n&gt; by my now EX-stepfather.  He also smacked me across<br/>\n&gt; the head once for &quot;telling him how to discipline his<br/>\n&gt; children&quot; (my two half sisters).  Btw, we are not in<br/>\n&gt; contact now.  I NEVER intended to spank my children<br/>\n&gt; and was relieved when my partner came around after<br/>\n&gt; talking to his psychology professor who recommended a<br/>\n&gt; parenting book to him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately,  I have lashed out and smacked/spanked<br/>\n&gt; my first son about three times on his butt or thigh. <br/>\n&gt; This was because I was stressed out, no patience left,<br/>\n&gt; angry because I was not in control etc.  Let me tell<br/>\n&gt; you, this DID NOT feel good.  I instantly felt guilty,<br/>\n&gt; sad, cried etc.  Needless to say, my son was hurt<br/>\n&gt; physically and emotionally.  What *was* his mom doing?<br/>\n&gt;  It truly hurt his feelings.  It can take a lot to<br/>\n&gt; control these feelings of wanting to spank your child.<br/>\n&gt;  But those feelings do need to be harnessed.  There<br/>\n&gt; are tender ways to address challenging behaviors, and<br/>\n&gt; parents need to seek them out while processing their<br/>\n&gt; own feelings of thinking they should spank, or<br/>\n&gt; harnessing the reflecting, hitting hand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Aside from dialoging, and trying to deal with<br/>\n&gt; behaviors through words, we have tried time outs.  We<br/>\n&gt; tried giving our son a few time outs (and these were<br/>\n&gt; usually for behaviors that were unsafe like repeatedly<br/>\n&gt; throwing a toy at a person), then we switched to<br/>\n&gt; giving the item a time out- the toy, not the person. <br/>\n&gt; Quite a few of my friends are not into time-outs/other<br/>\n&gt; punishments, so we have tried to be open minded about<br/>\n&gt; that approach, and really haven&#39;t felt the need to<br/>\n&gt; give too many time-outs at all.  It may have been on<br/>\n&gt; this list (but perhaps another) that a woman did not<br/>\n&gt; give time-outs, but gave time to think, thinking time.<br/>\n&gt;  So, I have tried this a couple times lately when our<br/>\n&gt; older son hasn&#39;t been gentle (but too rough!) with our<br/>\n&gt; one year old.  This worked ok as he likes Blues Clues<br/>\n&gt; and knows about the &quot;thinking chair&quot; and can grok what<br/>\n&gt; it means to think about something (he&#39;s not yet 3<br/>\n&gt; btw).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve read Althea Solter&#39;s the Aware Baby and got some<br/>\n&gt; good insights from there.  I know there are other<br/>\n&gt; sources out there, that I just have not gotton to. <br/>\n&gt; Fortunately we don&#39;t have too many challenging<br/>\n&gt; behaviors.  Alot, I guess is because we try to give<br/>\n&gt; our sons the most freedom as possible and only<br/>\n&gt; intervene when an action verges on not being safe, or<br/>\n&gt; rude, bad manners-like sharing is a good example.  As<br/>\n&gt; far as sharing, I went through a phase were I just let<br/>\n&gt; the kids work it out themselves, and now, say that<br/>\n&gt; they need to share OR take turns.

Here&#39;s the description:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The primary purpose of the NoMoreSpanking list is support for parents who<br/>\nwish to discover and utilize alternatives to spanking their children. This<br/>\nlist is not for debating, but is for providing help, information, ideas, and<br/>\nencouragement primarily for those who prefer not to use corporal punishment<br/>\non their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe official point of view of this list is that punishment may control a<br/>\nspecific behavior but that it unnecessarily interferes with the long-term<br/>\ngoal of promoting self-control and that alternative nonpunitive ways of<br/>\nrelating to children are preferred. Punishment includes hitting, spanking,<br/>\nswatting, shaming, ridiculing, threatening, using harsh or cruel words,<br/>\npenalizing, holding back rewards, or other methods that assert adult power<br/>\nor vent adult frustration. We are seeking alternative approaches that<br/>\nprovide guidance to our children that will encourage self-control, thinking<br/>\nbefore acting, learning to take responsibility for their own behavior, and<br/>\nespecially that will promote a lifelong warm, close, and open relationship<br/>\nbetween parent and child.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions and suggestions and support are welcome from parents, no matter<br/>\nwhat their parenting philosophies or practices, but this is not the place<br/>\nfor argumentative posts, particularly those that justify spanking. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo subscribe, send an email to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NoMoreSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">NoMoreSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>\n~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86181566,"authorName":"jennefer harper","from":"jennefer harper &lt;jenneferh2000@...&gt;","profile":"jenneferh2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"On spanking & more","postDate":"1091557747","msgId":2473,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODAzMTgyOTA3LjUzODAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjExMzA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2474,"prevInTime":2472,"nextInTime":2474,"topicId":2473,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As a nanny in my pre-parenting days, I picked up Sears The Discipline Book, and that was my introduction to the concept that discipline was more than a way of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1380064077\">As a nanny in my pre-parenting days, I picked up<br/>\nSears&#39; The Discipline Book, and that was my<br/>\nintroduction to the concept that discipline was more<br/>\nthan a way of dealing with &quot;undesired behaviors&quot;. <br/>\nAlthough I do not agree with everything in the book,<br/>\nit was a good intro to attachment parenting for me<br/>\n(aside from my instincts).
