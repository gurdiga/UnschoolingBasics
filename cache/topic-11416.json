I&#39;d hate to think this list was an only resource.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those that are just trying to figure out this whole unschooling<br/>\nthing, I highly recommend buying some of the conference CD&#39;s. They&#39;re<br/>\navailable at liveandlearnconference.org.<br/>\nCheck out Sandra Dodd&#39;s site for one of the most comprehensive sites<br/>\non the topic, with loads of links, articles and more.  Sandradodd.com<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more discussions at unschooling.info too.  I don&#39;t recommend<br/>\njoining one of Sandra&#39;s lists though, until you really start to &quot;get<br/>\nit&quot; because her lists are definitely geared for die hard unschoolers.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great place for getting started, but please, please do some<br/>\nreading and read the list guidelines and description here if you<br/>\nhaven&#39;t already. It will help you get more out of your experiences here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as books, there are tons of choices, but one should really read<br/>\nsome John Holt at some point.  Rue Kream&#39;s &quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot; is<br/>\na really great book too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11413,"nextTopicId":76}}
