We&#39;re starting <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling (for the first time) after the end of the <br/>\ncurrent school year, for the first time.  Sometimes I add the &quot;why <br/>\ndon&#39;t you&quot; part instead of listening.  dd is in 6th grade, so we&#39;re <br/>\nplanning lots of deschooling time, in fact, I let her have time now <br/>\nas much as possible, including her current interest on-line (Rune <br/>\nScape), and not worry too much about &quot;grades&quot;.   She will be <br/>\nfinishing the current school year (for many different reasons that <br/>\nwe&#39;re all comfortable with) then be free!  (both of us, I&#39;m quitting <br/>\nmy full time job as well).  We&#39;ll BOTH be deschooling, for as long as <br/>\nit takes.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Needing friends is another issue from the idea of how he &quot;should&quot; be<br/>\n </span></blockquote> spending his time, and on what types of activities. Many parents of <br/>\nteens and near teens have reported success by focusing on helping <br/>\ntheir kids pursue their interests with groups or societies founded on <br/>\nthe interest, rather than looking for age-peers.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point (founded on the interest), and one that fits my daughter. <br/>\nShe&#39;s pretty independent, cautious, and gaining confidence every day <br/>\nabout expressing her opinion and not mimicking the &quot;popular&quot; kids and <br/>\nwhat&#39;s expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I endorse all of Pam&#39;s suggestions about the reading material. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Also try making &quot;to Trust&quot; an action, rather than waiting for it <br/>\nfirst to become a feeling. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading and researching for 2 years, there&#39;s so much <br/>\ninformation out there, keep learning.  I had never heard of <br/>\nunschooling until I started to consider homeschooling a couple of <br/>\nyears ago.  Now I&#39;m on board, we just need to get on with it.
