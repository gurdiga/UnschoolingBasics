Although I feel that as a supportive parent it is a great honor to be able to honor our children&#39;s wishes, a five-year old is not that capable of understanding the severity of their actions if they fall.  While we can talk about falling, going to the hospital, becoming parapelegic, dying, etc none of these REALLY have the impact of understanding that we as adults understand it.  I believe there are many other ways to satisfy this desire to climb (I have an outrageous climber who wants to jump from our loft onto the couch at 3 yo - NO FEAR), I do not believe that THIS activity of climbing on the roof is an age-appropriate one. I wouldn&#39;t let my 5 yo jump off trains if he was interested and climbing on the roof can be every bit as dangerous, especially since it seems more innocent and can lead to the belief that everything is ok and then - SLIP - one second later you have a terrible situation on your hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also would not think to ask another neighbor about climbing on their rooftop, even if it were flat.  Unless you have a familial-type relationship with another family, they would probably worry about being sued if the child fell.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tcolleen_1@...\">tcolleen_1@...</a><br/>\nDate: Mon, 30 Mar 2009 17:52:16 +0000<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 5 yo. wants to play on the roof<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease be very careful about this. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a high school teacher who was killed when he fell off a roof, and I have another friend who was left a quadriplegic after he fell off a roof.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the &quot;climbing&quot; thing - I have a dd who is a climber, but I am the parent, and I am responsible for drawing the line at activities that I feel will endanger her.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my dd, we enrolled her in gymnastics, and working on the high beam and the bars helped her satisfy her desire to be up high, but she learned how to do it (reasonably) safely, and she also heard from people other than her parents about the dangers of falling from a high point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing you may try is to see if there is a gym or facility near you that has a rock-climbing wall.

In the house we rent now there are no roofs that they could climb on. Maybe the next house will be more roof friendly. Is the roof accessible? Can you get on the roof too? Can you find other roofs to go on? Sometimes at parks they have little summer house things that have a roof that could be climbed on?
