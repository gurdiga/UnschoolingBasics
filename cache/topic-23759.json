I have always<br/>\nsaid that my grandmother and my father for that matter are &quot;natural&quot;<br/>\nunschoolers.    My grandmother had a way about her that every kid she<br/>\ncame into contact with  desired her attention...you just wanted to<br/>\ndrink in anything she said or was interested in.   I remember the way<br/>\nher eyes would light up when she shared some new tidbit of information<br/>\nshe learned somewhere.   She was fascinated with EVERYTHING!   At any<br/>\nrate when my dad was in high school he had to do an animal anatomy<br/>\nproject for biology.  Lots of kids were doing models and so forth.  He<br/>\nand a buddy (his best buddy in life who continues to be his best<br/>\nfriend now that they are 65!)  found a cat that had died from natural<br/>\ncauses it seemed somewhere in their neighborhood.  They set up a<br/>\nkettle in the backyard and boiled the deceased cat down so they could<br/>\nextract the bones which they reassembled.   They had a very cool<br/>\nproject of a cat skeleton.   The other mothers were HORRIFIED that my<br/>\ngrandmother had allowed them to do that in her own backyard!! (think<br/>\nvery proper small southern town back yard of a very proper southern<br/>\nlady!)    Anyway she even gave them hotdogs to roast over their fire<br/>\nduring the process and helped them find books to help with the<br/>\nassembly.   <br/>\n*sigh*  I just realized once again how much I miss her!<br/>\nLisa Blocker <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I understand the question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Be satiated with hobbies and start academics?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 19 (and well...starting at 17-18), Cameron has become pretty <br/>\n&gt; interested in academics.
