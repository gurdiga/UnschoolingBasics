For me, <br/>\nreading and answering posts gives *me* a better perspective on my <br/>\nown life and parenting, too. There are times when I&#39;m making a <br/>\nsuggestion and thinking &quot;hey, I should be doing more of that!&quot; There <br/>\nare other times when answering a post that I&#39;ll see a solution to a <br/>\nproblem I&#39;ve had myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m lousy at asking questions. There are some people on these boards <br/>\nwho are fabulous at asking really complex questions. I love that. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t do that. Its a whole different kind of ability. I&#39;m not the <br/>\nsort of person who can just write, either - that amazes me. I need <br/>\nsomeone else to get me started, to nudge me in a direction. That&#39;s <br/>\nan important part of *my* process.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s wonderful wisdom on the unschooling boards! I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve <br/>\nfound some in my posts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Did you start at this same confused, damaged place that I did <br/>\n&gt; and you&#39;ve just been at it longer? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I started out pretty confused and damaged - my &#39;true confessions&#39; <br/>\ntend to get posted on AU more than here, just bc of the nature of <br/>\nthe questions people ask. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are you versed in psychological <br/>\n&gt; concepts?  Did you read some special books? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to answer this from a different direction - I think of <br/>\nparenting as a spiritual practice. For *me* that ends up being an <br/>\noutgrowth of my zen and yoga practices, but I&#39;ve met other parents <br/>\nonline and irl for whom its a christian practice, or a wiccan <br/>\npractice or &quot;simply&quot; a matter of being passionately devoted to their <br/>\nfamilies. Just like with our kids, its not so much a matter of how <br/>\nand where things are learned - the learning itself grows out of a <br/>\njoyful connection with life.<br/>\n<br/>\n*And* I read a lot of unschooling boards and blogs and websites. <br/>\nThich Nhat Hahn doesn&#39;t hold a candle to a Danielle or Ren or <br/>\nShuyler talking about a day with their kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170380942,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt;","profile":"cslisacs","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Wisdom of the group in general, Meredith in particular","postDate":"1176272631","msgId":23109,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV2aHV0bitzczBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23120,"prevInTime":23108,"nextInTime":23110,"topicId":23109,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I read this group, Always Unschooled, and Consensual Living when I get time.

I can tell *something* is wrong or undesireable or off .. but <br/>\nI am rarely able to figure out what the true meat of it is.
