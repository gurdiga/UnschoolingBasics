Asking players to call them is asking for their phone number , correct? So NO, it is not normal. <br/>\n<br/>\nReport players for this by using the ingame report abuse button. :)<br/>\nHope this helped, Nola (PS: add me to friends Effie5413)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Deirdre adds:  Your ds can also add George (13 yo ds)  He is superman5606 on Runescape.  George and Nola read the rules of conduct when they started playing and then explained it to me!  I made sure they knew what &quot;personal information&quot; *is*, and I tried to think of ways I could trick someone into telling me something about themselves.   And I hung out with them when they were first playing (i&#39;m too lazy to have my own character.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also discussed scamming on the game.   This is one of the many ways I think my kids have benefitted from Runescape.  When you have worked hard to raise the money for that item you wanted, and someone tricks you out of your money or your item, it hurts!    My kids have discovered the difference between helping someone and someone scamming you.  And that sometimes there&#39;s a gray area between those two things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd adults do play Runescape.   My kids knew that going into it because the son and dad that introduced us to the game both play it and they are both on their friends list.  But this is the one concept I have had to work hard to make sure the kids &quot;get.&quot;  Just because someone tells you that they are a 12 year old boy living in California, doesn&#39;t mean a singe bit of that is true!  They can even send you a picture of themselves (not on Runescape, but instant messaging), but they just use someone else&#39;s picture, that sort of thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to really exploit my kids, someone would have to do more than just find out where we live.  They would have to get past me and my dog.  &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeirdre<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Message: 10        <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Sun, 26 Feb 2006 10:32:22 -0800 (PST)<br/>\n&gt;    From: michele oquinn &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mmoquinn@...\">mmoquinn@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: new to list<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 11yo ds loves Runescape.  Finally became a member<br/>\n&gt; this past week.  Is it common for someone to ask<br/>\n&gt; another player to call them?  Last week that happened<br/>\n&gt; but I didn&#39;t let him call.  I have no idea who this<br/>\n&gt; person was.  HOW do we know what is safe?  Anyone<br/>\n&gt; could be impersonating a kid online, right?  All we<br/>\n&gt; had to do when my son signed up was give them my email<br/>\n&gt; address.  That doesn&#39;t seem like much.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want him to enjoy his time online, but honestly I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t follow those games too well.  Please let me know<br/>\n&gt; if I&#39;m just being paranoid!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He really wants to meet other unschoolers since most<br/>\n&gt; of his &quot;schooled&quot; friends don&#39;t have much time to be<br/>\n&gt; online with him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks.

My name is Sybelle and dh is Arnold and we are an unschooling family with a ds 12 and dd 8.<br/>\nMy son just joined Runescape this week also. He has been calling with his friends in CA (we live in AZ) to coordinate when and where they play. But if someone would just ask him to call out of the blue, i would think that to be very strange!<br/>\nHe has been asking how he could get more friends to play, since some of his friends go to school (so they don&#39;t have time) and others have computer restrictions. I&#39;m not sure how you go about making friends to play with. But now that I know there is a yahoo group for players, that might be a way.<br/>\nAnd Michelle, if you want to mail me off-line, maybe your and my son could meet per email and then meet in the game somewhere. I have not sat with Ingo a lot to understand the game, but it looks very cool to me and I&#39;d like to play myself sometime!<br/>\nSybelle<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10237,"nextTopicId":10256}}
