The Ache, who are a hunter-gatherer population <br/>\nfrom Paraguay, don&#39;t marry that early. They sort of play around at it for a <br/>\nlittle while before settling into a long-term pair bond. I&#39;m talking it over <br/>\nwith David (dh) at the mo&#39; and he is suggesting that pre-pubertal marriage <br/>\nis a way of men monopolozing an entire female&#39;s reproductive career. And I <br/>\ncan think of at least one population, who have really high infant mortality <br/>\nrates to younger mothers, for whom older women who have already had children <br/>\nare more sought after than are young women who have never had a baby (the <br/>\nHiwi of Venezuala).<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about my Great-Aunt Pearl, who married at 14, living in rural, <br/>\nwestern Kansas there may also be something about these frontier child-brides <br/>\nin an era when more men were moving in than women and so these children were <br/>\nseen as fair game for these seemingly affluent, or at least morally upright, <br/>\nmen. I know that early age at marriage is often associated with frontiers. <br/>\nSo it is a kind of r-selection reproductive strategy where by having lots of <br/>\nkids early who can spread out and utilize lots of the resources available is <br/>\ngoing to lead to greater genetic representation in future generations than <br/>\nit would in an environment that was closer to its carrying capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just found an interesting UK statistics page <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/xsdataset.asp?More=Y&vlnk=5279&All=Y&B2.x=109&B2.y=19)\">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/xsdataset.asp?More=Y&vlnk=5279&All=Y&B2.x=109&B2.y=19)</a> <br/>\nlisting the mean ages of marriage of women from 1846-2001 by previous <br/>\nmarital status. For all single women in 1846 the mean age at marriage was <br/>\n24.71 years old. And here&#39;s a very short list for the U.S. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html\">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005061.html</a> which has the median age for <br/>\nwomen in 1890 at 22.0. So, maybe the perception is different from the <br/>\nreality? I wanted to find data on the Hutterites, an Anabaptist religious <br/>\nsect that have really fascinating patterns of marriage and reproduction, <br/>\nwith huge birth cohorts, but they are a relatively closed community, and I <br/>\nmay not be using the right search terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of stuff out there about age at first marriage. I talked to <br/>\nmy mom tonight and Aunt Pearl got married because she was pregnant. <br/>\nApparently my grandpa&#39;s family moved to get away from the shame and stigma <br/>\nas well.

Age at menarche, or first <br/>\nmenstruation, for women without access to the abundance of food that I have <br/>\naccess to, and presumably you do to, is 14 to 18. Which means, if you take <br/>\nthe death age to be 18, they would have a baby and have to hand it off to <br/>\nsome other kid as they died a year or two or three later. Particularly as in <br/>\nhumans there is a period after reaching sexual maturity when you aren&#39;t <br/>\nquite fertile. So, you may be able to menstruate, but many of your periods <br/>\nwon&#39;t actually have an egg being dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a paper cited (which gives a nice blurred life expectancy in the <br/>\ntable) by Hillard Kaplan (my graduate advisor at UNM) that may or may not <br/>\nmake things clearer. Actually the life table at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Life.html\">http://www.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Life.html</a> , which is cited at <br/>\nWikipedia&#39;s life expectancy page, lays it out pretty well. You can see that <br/>\nif you look at life expectancy from age 0 you get a very skewed <br/>\nunderstanding of adult age at death.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. As a personal experience, my great Aunt Pearl married at 12 or 13 (I <br/>\nthink 12) to an abusive husband whom she later left. But she lived to be <br/>\nalmost 100.
