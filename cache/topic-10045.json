I&#39;m Robin, mother to Markus(12), Collin (23mos), and <br/>\nKatherine (3mos). <br/>\n <br/>\nAfter 7 years of frustration with administration, teachers (we saw <br/>\ngood ones too) and what I refer to as &quot;useless, stupid&quot; lesson plans, <br/>\nwe pulled Markus out of public school 3wks ago.  We were both <br/>\npub/priv schooled and have never known homeschoolers/unschoolers so <br/>\npulling him out at all was pretty radical for us. (Not to mention we <br/>\nhave several teachers in the family who are quite skeptical.)<br/>\nTo say the least, we&#39;re hyperventilating a bit, trying to relax. We <br/>\nwere all 3 thinking the same thing privately for wks before it was <br/>\nsaid aloud so I feel like this &quot;found&quot; us. <br/>\nFrankly, if I&#39;d known more about the subject, I probably would have <br/>\nseen it coming when Markus was in 1st grd.  He always said, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to learn to read when I get to school.&quot; He started 1st grd not <br/>\nknowing his alphabet, but by 2nd grd was reading the Narnia novels <br/>\nand the Bible (we&#39;re not particularly devout). Anyway, once he <br/>\nlearned to read - in late September - he had no use for school.  It <br/>\nwas an argument every morning for the rest of the yr.  Like I <br/>\nsaid...I should have known. Can&#39;t change the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we made our decision, we did a lot of research and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhere we first heard of unschooling.  We&#39;re trying to figure out our <br/>\npath, but I bought Markus a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re reading it together and I&#39;m finding it makes more and more <br/>\nsense! Given that we already feel a bit radical, the idea of going <br/>\nthe extra step to unschool is tantalizing but terrifying.  <br/>\n(Brainwashed, we are, perhaps!) :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve spent the whole afternoon reading through posts here and I hope <br/>\nno one minds if I mostly lurk for a while just listening to your <br/>\nideas, enthusiasm, successes, frustrations, and solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a question.  Currently, Markus is reading Thomas More&#39;s <br/>\nUtopia. (His pick.) I started talking to him about literary <br/>\ntechniques More used - he wasn&#39;t uninterested, but not really <br/>\nenthralled.  We&#39;ve talked a lot about Thomas More&#39;s life and he watch <br/>\nA Man for All Seasons today, which he found very interesting with <br/>\nregards to history and social stds.  My 1st inclination is to give <br/>\nhim some ideas to write about himself (he likes to write short <br/>\nstories) - i.e. what would his own Utopia look like or how does <br/>\nMore&#39;s Utopia/England compare to modern America, etc.  As an <br/>\nUNSCHOOLER, do you let them think of these things themselves or do <br/>\nyou offer the list and then let it be?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41137,"nextTopicId":41145}}
