I solved the problem by building<br/>\na cage out of those white wire shelves and wire ties.  I made it big enough<br/>\nto fit a small litter box and food and water and a bed for the kitties.<br/>\nWhen I felt the kittens had had enough handling they went in the cage for<br/>\ntheir nap.  The kids could gather round the cage and still see them but they<br/>\nknew it was the kitties sleep time and they didn&#39;t bother them.  I also was<br/>\nconstantly there with my kids, playing with them, loving them, and meeting<br/>\ntheir needs. My house was a wreck but my kids had their needs met.  What are<br/>\nyour priorities?  Be with them, really with them.  Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174410770,"authorName":"D Smith","from":"D Smith &lt;sandshuse@...&gt;","profile":"sandshuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Conflict resolution; to interfere or not interefere","postDate":"1157334681","msgId":17087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTA0MDE1MTIxLjQ0OTEwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkZnA5YytiMGg3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17086,"nextInTopic":17089,"prevInTime":17086,"nextInTime":17088,"topicId":17086,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Everyone in our household deserves peace and safety.

Currently in my<br/>\nlife, my son is picking on two little kittens his<br/>\ndaddy brought home. I&#39;ve talked to him about why he is<br/>\ndoing it. I think I understand at times, but he won&#39;t<br/>\nstop. I don&#39;t know how to make him stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost it a few times, and spanked him. For which I<br/>\ncry more than he does. I apologise for spanking him,<br/>\nand tell him it&#39;s wrong to spank him. Some days I<br/>\nthink he understands and others I feel he just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nget it. Seperating them doesn&#39;t seem to help. Because<br/>\nhe waits till I&#39;m busy and then goes in the room they<br/>\nare in and just hurts them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told him, that I am seriously considering giving<br/>\nthe kittens back to the lady that gave them to us.<br/>\nI&#39;ll be sad, and he doesn&#39;t want them to go, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know what else to do? <br/>\n<br/>\nI will value any help with this. We are in the middle<br/>\nof moving too. And under a lot of stress, which I<br/>\nbelieve contribute to this behavior. I just don&#39;t want<br/>\nhim to be mean to animals. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\nDanie<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
