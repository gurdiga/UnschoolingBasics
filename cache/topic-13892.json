You were defending her. You said you&#39;d had to &quot;deal with that&quot;  <br/>\nwith your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say you DID mean to advocate it, by the way. I asked you if  <br/>\nthat is what you did and what you meant. I asked the question because  <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t clear from your post if you meant that you had successfully  <br/>\ndone (in just a few months) what she hadn&#39;t been able to do in four  <br/>\nyears.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read questions as questions, not as attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>\nwatch TV for 4 years, she is obviously<br/>\nmindful of that and has tried to sway them onto other activities to  <br/>\nno avail.  So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she  <br/>\nget her kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests  <br/>\non them--still giving them freedom and being mindful???

My point is that it is NOT mindful  <br/>\nparenting, not unschooling, to try to sway them to other activities,  <br/>\naway from what they love. That is not what I would suggest - is that  <br/>\nwhat you are advocating? (a question - not an attack)  The advice I&#39;d  <br/>\nhave given her would have been to embrace and engage and expand -  <br/>\nfind ways to get involved, show respect and honor their choices, and  <br/>\nexpand on their activities, to help them see connections all over the  <br/>\nplace, but not to try to lure them away because you think their  <br/>\nchoices are bad ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263883708,"authorName":"camden","from":"&quot;camden&quot; &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: introduction and conference comments","postDate":"1149285036","msgId":13961,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxY2QwMWM2ODY4ZSRiODU2YzQ5MCQ2NjAxYThjMEBIT01FPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU1cWJkdStxMGI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13958,"nextInTopic":13962,"prevInTime":13960,"nextInTime":13962,"topicId":13892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thats so funny Jann.

I think there are people  <br/>\nwho think unschooling means being hands-off parents, &quot;letting the  <br/>\nkids do what they want&quot; gets interpreted as parents leaving them  <br/>\n&quot;alone&quot; to do what they want. It is very possible that this person  <br/>\nhad that erroneous impression of unschooling - in which case, she  <br/>\ncould claim to have been unschooling for the past four years while  <br/>\ndoing nothing to support her kids interests and doing nothing to  <br/>\ncreate a rich and stimulating environment for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>\n&gt; watch TV for 4 years,<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all - anybody who says that is almost certainly exaggerating  <br/>\nand so is starting out on shaky, somewhat dishonest, ground. I bet  <br/>\nher kids did LOTS of other things - I bet they ate food, went places,  <br/>\netc. What people mean when they say that is almost always that the  <br/>\nkids LOVE to play videogames and watch tv and do way more of it than  <br/>\nthe parent is comfortable with and that the parent thought that, if  <br/>\nthey were left alone, the kids would eventually come to see  <br/>\nvideogames and tv the same way the parent does, as less-than- <br/>\nworthwhile activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - &quot;playing vidoegames&quot; is not one &quot;thing.&quot; Neither is watching  <br/>\ntv. An involved unschooling mom would be talking about WHAT the kids  <br/>\nwere playing and watching - would see the playing and watching as  <br/>\ninvolving many varied activities. Just yesterday I posted somewhere  <br/>\nabout my 18 year old playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; for many hours over the  <br/>\nprevious couple of days. Playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; is not at all the same as  <br/>\nplaying &quot;Halo,&quot; or &quot;Guild Wars&quot; or &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;Neopets,&quot;  <br/>\netc. Heck, even saying someone was playing, &quot;Neopets,&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ndescribe what they were doing - it involves all kinds of different  <br/>\ngames - logic puzzles, word games, as well as interpersonal  <br/>\nactivities and designing and taking care of pets and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; she is obviously mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto  <br/>\n&gt; other activities to no<br/>\n&gt; avail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - does an unschooling parent do that? Try to &quot;sway them onto other  <br/>\nactivities?&quot; I haven&#39;t ever thought of that as my role. What I do,  <br/>\ninstead, is support the activities they ARE interested in pursuing,  <br/>\nwhile making sure that their lives include exposure to many  <br/>\ninteresting experiences and options. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;sway them  <br/>\naway&quot; from what they are interested in, I AM always expanding our  <br/>\nworld to allow them to have as many possibilities in their lives as I  <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she get her<br/>\n&gt; kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on  <br/>\n&gt; them--still<br/>\n&gt; giving them freedom and being mindful???<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t do that. If her goal is to force them off the computer and away  <br/>\nfrom the tv, she&#39;ll create resistance or apathy - those are always  <br/>\nthe net result of coercion - people either resist (passively or  <br/>\nactively) or they give up and submit to authority.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think that issue is what is hard for newbies---I know I had to  <br/>\n&gt; deal with that with my boys, of course it was<br/>\n&gt; for 2 months, not 4 years---but it certainly is scary nontheless!<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you eventually force them away from the computer and tv?

I said that IF a parent thought something was detrimental to<br/>\ntheir children and simply stood by and watched, then THAT would be<br/>\nneglect. I stand by that.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe claimed her children were unhealthy. Would you stand by and watch<br/>\nyour child be unhealthy, not learning (according to her, though I know<br/>\nthey had to be learning because they were breathing!!) and just WAIT???<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about ignoring our fears, it&#39;s about openly<br/>\nexamining them and finding out whether there is any validity to them!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about being WITH our children, entering into their passions and<br/>\nHONORING those passions. It&#39;s not exactly honoring a passion to stand<br/>\nby and hope they&#39;ll get involved in something else for FOUR years!!<br/>\nYikes to the tenth power.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I saw my children were unhealthy and not learning, I&#39;d be VERY<br/>\nconcerned. What I see in that situation is a mother that is not<br/>\nhonoring their interests, a parent that isn&#39;t really offering up<br/>\nviable alternatives that are at least as fun as the video games.<br/>\nWhat I hear is a lot of fear and NOT anything about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s neglect to watch your child be unhealthy for four years. But<br/>\nif she&#39;d stopped waiting and simply started DOING and being WITH them,<br/>\nI bet she&#39;d see they were actually learning and growing quite beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is providing a rich and interesting environment for ALL<br/>\nfamily members. It&#39;s about pursuing your own passions and truly<br/>\nhonoring each person&#39;s uniqueness.<br/>\nIt&#39;s about meeting the child where they are TODAY, not who you hope<br/>\nthey&#39;ll become. <br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t believe that four different children would do NOTHING<br/>\nelse for four years in a rich and stimulating environment. Sorry,<br/>\ndon&#39;t buy it. Prove it to me.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a full-time gamer, so I&#39;m not doubting the time spent on video<br/>\ngames by some people. I have four children that all LOVE video games,<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve never seen any of them (other than Trevor) go for an entire<br/>\nday without doing anything else. Even my full-time video gamer is more<br/>\nthan willing to join us if the activity is interesting enough to him!<br/>\nI can see a ton of learning gained from his very intense interest in<br/>\nthis form of entertainment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone doubting the amazing power of video games for learning, please<br/>\nread &quot;A Whole New Mind&quot; by Danielle Pink. AMAZING book, all backed<br/>\nwith solid research.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, if a person wants to come on here and tell me they waited four<br/>\nyears and several children chose NOTHING but tv and video games, I&#39;m<br/>\nnot going to believe them until they qualify the information with some<br/>\ngood dialogue. She&#39;s not going to do that obviously, because I doubt<br/>\nit&#39;s true and even if it was, it just proves she was NOT unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be fine if she wanted to GET to unschooling and try to<br/>\nunderstand.

I don&#39;t post often because I know that when you communicate there is the person giving the information and teh person receiving the information.   When you receive information unless you are face to face you can give a tone to the information based on your feelings at the time of reading the information but I have come to some great realizations from the posts about who I am and how I relate to my three children.  I had attended several conferences and listened to many presenters on unschooling before I made the decision to unschool my children and what I learned was that I had to deal with all my concerns and insecurities before I could let go of schooly things and just live and learn with my children and the changes that I see in my children are unbelievable.  My husband, my mom and my three sisters are impressed by what they see in my children and I can<br/>\n not say enough that  I know when I started to listen and trust my children and they know that then our relationships has changed so much. I say all this to say to anyone who has be offended or bothered by what was posted by those who are not new to unschooling before you choose to be hurt maybe look at why you feel that way and if there is something that is personal maybe look at that  and do what you need to do for you.  I hope i did not offend anyone for that truely was not my intent but I needed to say that.

It is very possible that this person  <br/>\nhad that erroneous impression of unschooling - in which case, she  <br/>\ncould claim to have been unschooling for the past four years while  <br/>\ndoing nothing to support her kids interests and doing nothing to  <br/>\ncreate a rich and stimulating environment for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In her case, her kids have done nothing but play video games and  <br/>\n&gt; watch TV for 4 years,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First of all - anybody who says that is almost certainly exaggerating  <br/>\nand so is starting out on shaky, somewhat dishonest, ground. I bet  <br/>\nher kids did LOTS of other things - I bet they ate food, went places,  <br/>\netc. What people mean when they say that is almost always that the  <br/>\nkids LOVE to play videogames and watch tv and do way more of it than  <br/>\nthe parent is comfortable with and that the parent thought that, if  <br/>\nthey were left alone, the kids would eventually come to see  <br/>\nvideogames and tv the same way the parent does, as less-than- <br/>\nworthwhile activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - &quot;playing vidoegames&quot; is not one &quot;thing.&quot; Neither is watching  <br/>\ntv. An involved unschooling mom would be talking about WHAT the kids  <br/>\nwere playing and watching - would see the playing and watching as  <br/>\ninvolving many varied activities. Just yesterday I posted somewhere  <br/>\nabout my 18 year old playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; for many hours over the  <br/>\nprevious couple of days. Playing &quot;The SIMS&quot; is not at all the same as  <br/>\nplaying &quot;Halo,&quot; or &quot;Guild Wars&quot; or &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; or &quot;Neopets,&quot;  <br/>\netc. Heck, even saying someone was playing, &quot;Neopets,&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ndescribe what they were doing - it involves all kinds of different  <br/>\ngames - logic puzzles, word games, as well as interpersonal  <br/>\nactivities and designing and taking care of pets and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she is obviously mindful of that and has tried to sway them onto  <br/>\n&gt; other activities to no<br/>\n&gt; avail.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So - does an unschooling parent do that? Try to &quot;sway them onto other  <br/>\nactivities?&quot; I haven&#39;t ever thought of that as my role. What I do,  <br/>\ninstead, is support the activities they ARE interested in pursuing,  <br/>\nwhile making sure that their lives include exposure to many  <br/>\ninteresting experiences and options. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;sway them  <br/>\naway&quot; from what they are interested in, I AM always expanding our  <br/>\nworld to allow them to have as many possibilities in their lives as I  <br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, where would the happy medium be for her, how can she get her<br/>\n&gt; kids out of their room without forcing her ideals/interests on  <br/>\n&gt; them--still<br/>\n&gt; giving them freedom and being mindful???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can&#39;t do that. If her goal is to force them off the computer and away  <br/>\nfrom the tv, she&#39;ll create resistance or apathy - those are always  <br/>\nthe net result of coercion - people either resist (passively or  <br/>\nactively) or they give up and submit to authority.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think that issue is what is hard for newbies---I know I had to  <br/>\n&gt; deal with that with my boys, of course it was<br/>\n&gt; for 2 months, not 4 years---but it certainly is scary nontheless!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you eventually force them away from the computer and tv?

How did that happen?  <br/>\nHow did we go from a society where kids had freedom to explore all  <br/>\nday to one where parents are telling children what and how to play on  <br/>\nthe monkey bars? If kids get the chance to play at the park between  <br/>\nmyriad lessons and groups....I&#39;ve also gotten a lot of parents IRL  <br/>\nwho sigh theatrically and complain about all the stuff they are doing  <br/>\nAND THE KIDS FIGHT EVERY STEP of the way. At the same time, the  <br/>\nindictment &quot;You are *so* lucky, Melissa, that you don&#39;t have to do  <br/>\nthat.&quot; What one friend told me (and my parents too) was that I&#39;m  <br/>\ndoing my kids a grave disservice by not forcing them into a few  <br/>\nactivities. I&#39;ve offered, we do stuff on our own, but no one really  <br/>\nhas that desire right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I&#39;m off on my own vent. My stepmom was giving me a hard time  <br/>\nand I&#39;m still recovering. I gave as good as I got, but it stressed me  <br/>\nout, and I resent having to defend anything. Then on two different  <br/>\ngroups this week I&#39;ve had to read people who are saying that my  <br/>\nlifestyle is inappropriate.

The oldest two are<br/>\nstepchildren. The       15 y.o., Jacob, left school<br/>\nthe end of 7th grade until 8th, generally played video<br/>\ngames all year and had frequent run-ins with his Dad<br/>\nabout trying to follow a curriculum which he wanted<br/>\nhim to do to try to meet requirements - all that was a<br/>\nbit frustrating. So he went back to highschool.<br/>\nMeanwhile I found out about unschooling  and reading<br/>\nevery back issue of Life Learning online - One issue I<br/>\ngot in the mail had a great article about a young girl<br/>\nleaving highschool, which I gave to my stepson, plus I<br/>\nfound the Teenage liberation handbook and gave both of<br/>\nthose to him to read, since I could see he was not<br/>\nenjoying highschool anymore either - <br/>\nHe said that is exactly how he felt and stayed home<br/>\nfrom school to read the book, than we brainstormed how<br/>\nto get him home ASAP where he now is - happily<br/>\nunschooling. Unschooling is so right for him i see the<br/>\nchanges already, in his happiness and calmness and<br/>\nquietly going about finding out things about the world<br/>\n.<br/>\nI thought I was already unschooling my 4 y.o. but when<br/>\nI joined this email list I learned so much more in<br/>\nsuch a short time already I am very grateful to all of<br/>\nyou. <br/>\nSo when I heard about the conference I had to go. <br/>\none of the biggest issues I had with the unschooling<br/>\nwas that I did not know too many people doing this (2<br/>\nfamilies total, one who is moving away, one I just met<br/>\nrecently and got to know better at the conference - hi<br/>\nCyndi). My ds just loves to find other children to<br/>\nplay with and would like to make some friends. We<br/>\noften go places where we find other kids, but I have <br/>\nfound that I get extreemely stressful around those<br/>\nsituations. The kids are often rude (no, you can&#39;t<br/>\nplay with us, we don&#39;t know you),  or &#39; if you do that<br/>\n(whatever?) I&#39;ll kil you,  or the parents<br/>\n(babysitters) have this horrible way of parenting that<br/>\njust makes me cringe everytime I see it. Like<br/>\ntime-outs, threats to say &#39;sorry&#39;, counting to 3 as if<br/>\nthe world is going to blow up when they reach that<br/>\nnumber ( don&#39;t know what that is all about...?).<br/>\nSo, when we got to the conference my son was in<br/>\nabsolute bliss, the children there  were more than<br/>\nwilling to play, involve him, be respectful and<br/>\nengaging, and when someone accidentaly hurt another in<br/>\nsome wild playing, they would go over to that child<br/>\nand say they were truly sorry, they did not meant to<br/>\nhurt them.  I missed pretty much all of the talks<br/>\nbecause of my two little ones, but just being there<br/>\nwas so worth it, even just to see my ds beaming and<br/>\nhaving so much fun and meating all those other<br/>\nwonderfully free children. <br/>\nI also enjoyed meeting other parents and staying up<br/>\ntalking until 12:30 am on saturday (Joanne, Lucian<br/>\njust LOVED playing with your daughters and is asking<br/>\nif he will see them again).<br/>\nI did hear bits and pieces of talks from Ren and Kelly<br/>\nand even those bits got me thinking more -<br/>\nContrary to my sons I was still too shy to go up to<br/>\nall the people I would have loved to have talked to,<br/>\nbut I certainly know this won&#39;t be my last conference<br/>\nand I am very happy that I can still talk to you now<br/>\nand ask all those questions that have been coming up.<br/>\nAlready, being on the list and going to the conference<br/>\ni have been  fine-tuning my parenting, implementing<br/>\ntotal freedom and choice in food, tv and bedtime and,<br/>\ninspired by Whole life unschooling,  also took up<br/>\nplaying the saxophone again and learning another<br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\nThank you so much to all of you who run this list and<br/>\nwho organized and ran the conference, I believe you<br/>\nare doing a great service to humanity and civilisation<br/>\nand have already changed our life for the better. <br/>\nThe conference also opened up good talks to my dh ( we<br/>\nare doing WHAT with out children? So unschooling is<br/>\nnot just doing nothing at all?) as well as with my<br/>\nfather who was agressively negative about<br/>\nhomeschooling. For the first time (after the<br/>\nconference) we had a very positive talk about things<br/>\nand as I compared the schooled kids to the unschooled<br/>\nand as he remembered what i was like before I entered<br/>\nschool - volunteering at the circus to ride the<br/>\nelephant at age 4 - and after I entered school - being<br/>\ntotally shocked in a room full of 40 other kids and<br/>\nbecoming very shy and unsure of myself for a long<br/>\ntime.<br/>\nAt the end of our talk he was already looking up books<br/>\nabout Holt in German, and telling me of a few other<br/>\nGerman authors that had similar ideas - he has after<br/>\nall written books on education and Janusz Korzak and<br/>\nis now realizing a LOT of things -<br/>\nAnyways, sorry I ramble on. I just was still so<br/>\nexcited about it all and look forward to asking<br/>\nquestions and reading your wonderful comments on this<br/>\nlist - and another great big THANK YOU!<br/>\nLove and virtual hugs to you all -<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

That&#39;s the purpose of <br/>\nthis list, as I understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I remember correctly, she was writing that her kids did not take <br/>\nto unschooling because they were not interested in much else than <br/>\ngaming and TV watching.  But, it seemed to me that it may have been <br/>\nmore about her expectations than anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in order for unschooling to work we have to accept and love <br/>\nour kids as they are, not as we wish them to be!  When we can accept <br/>\nthem just as they are, we give them the freedom to become who they <br/>\nare!  It&#39;s glorious to be part of, and it&#39;s so easy to stifle our <br/>\nkids with only our expectations, even if we don&#39;t say a thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m telling you, if people can trust this process, they will see <br/>\namazing things unfold, just like the peonies in my yard!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarning, Folks:  I feel another flower analogy coming on!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we have a couple of peonies right by our front door, and when <br/>\nthey&#39;re first growing they put out these round buds that open up to <br/>\nbe these giant boisterous flowers that have an amazing aroma.  When <br/>\nthe buds are first opening, they really look too small to produce <br/>\nthat kind of a flower and after the flower opens fully, you have to <br/>\nwonder how on earth all that flower could have come from that tiny, <br/>\nlittle bud.  Of course, if you try to interfere &#39;cause you think it&#39;s <br/>\nnot going well and it needs your help, you ruin the whole <br/>\nprocess.   But, if you can just trust the flower to do what it&#39;s <br/>\nsupposed to do, you get rewarded with this incredible blossom!!<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, our peonies open later than our neighbors&#39; do.  I <br/>\nguess they have their own time schedule, but eventually they do <br/>\nopen.  Also, sometimes those blossoms are so big and heavy that we <br/>\nput a stake in the ground close by to support them.  But, we never <br/>\ntell &#39;em what to do or when to do it!

A new person signs on<br/>\nand the first thing that they post is along the lines of, &quot;I hate<br/>\nvegetarianism.  I have no energy.  I&#39;m not getting enough protein and iron.<br/>\nI&#39;m tired of eating salads and I just think it is the wrong thing to do.&quot;<br/>\nHow long do you think it is going to take for that person to be &quot;judged&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;chastized&quot;?  They most likely will be questioned as to why they joined a<br/>\nvegetarian list to begin with if they hate it so much.  Now what the person<br/>\n*may* be asking is, &quot;I&#39;m having difficulty with understanding how to get<br/>\nenough pretein and iron in my diet.  I know I&#39;m not eating the right foods.<br/>\nCan you help me figure out what I am doing wrong so that I can continue to<br/>\nhave a healthy and vegetarian lifestyle?&quot;  But that&#39;s not what they asked.<br/>\nThe condemned veggie eating, made a bunch of people angry and then when<br/>\npeople didn&#39;t answer their real (underlying and deeply cloaked) question of<br/>\nhow to fix their eating, they got huffy and decided that all vegetarians are<br/>\nmean and judgemental.  It&#39;s this one person&#39;s attitude, not the list&#39;s.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDid the person who started this thread do anything different?  I doubt it.<br/>\nBut she also didn&#39;t come here with a seemingly open mind or at least she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t represent herself as such.  She also didn&#39;t represent herself as<br/>\ntruly unschooling.  It seems like they were &quot;unliving.&quot;  In a pergatory-like<br/>\nholding pattern waiting for life to do something for them.  It makes me<br/>\nwonder if she actually had read much on unschooling or trusted any of the<br/>\nthings she has read because of mainstream prejudices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"hating homeschooling and unparenting","postDate":"1149251831","msgId":13892,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1cGJkbit0cjQ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13897,"prevInTime":13891,"nextInTime":13893,"topicId":13892,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"but when a newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new and their children are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and its new and scary","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1600059714\">&quot;but when a newbie parent comes here freaking out because this is new<br/>\nand their children are doing the usual stuck on TV or video games and<br/>\nits new and scary to them---they get chatised and judged for reacting<br/>\nand worrying. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit.<br/>\nThey get advice and support and information and questions.<br/>\nThey get loads of FREE information and complete gentleness UNTIL they<br/>\nstart lambasting the folks that live this lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone comes on here with a vague notion of what unschooling<br/>\nreally is, they may find it very challenging and have quite a bit to<br/>\nsay.

You really need both<br/>\nfor successful unschooling.
