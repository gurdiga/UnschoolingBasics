My dh also doesn&#39;t agree <br/>\nwith unschooling.  He agreed to homeschool, but I think that neither <br/>\nof us understood how much unschooling would change our lives.  My dh <br/>\nunderstands that a child will learn what they need to know, so he&#39;s <br/>\nok with that part.  There was a time when he would ask &quot;why I don&#39;t <br/>\ntake homeschooling seriously like other people do&quot;, meaning, &quot;why <br/>\ndon&#39;t I force book work&quot;.  I simply asked him to think of how many <br/>\nmen he knew that didn&#39;t graduate from high school and then asked if <br/>\nthey worked and supported their families.  He said &quot;of course&quot;, so <br/>\nthat showed him that the learning part will be fine.  His big thing <br/>\nis that he is afraid the kids won&#39;t ever be able to hold a job and <br/>\nsupport themselves and will live with us forever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe part that he is having a real hard time with is that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve children deserve equal respect.  He believes that they are <br/>\nlazy and will never hold a job because I don&#39;t force chores on them.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure this is going to work out for us because this is a huge <br/>\nissue and his being disrespectful to the kids makes me not respect <br/>\nhim.  This is kind of what Joanne said too.  He thinks that I am <br/>\ngiving the kids too much power and that they will be spoiled.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how your fiance feels about this issue, but it is one that <br/>\nyou both have to agree on or I don&#39;t think it will work.  Granted, I <br/>\nbelieve that one parent unschooling is better than no parent <br/>\nunschooling, but I think two parents unschooling would be best.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, Kelly, my dh is not going to the conference.

So many things seem to be so <br/>\nclandestine, unfortunately.  It&#39;s just that my husband is a known cynic <br/>\nand I am passionate about unschooling being a vital component to the <br/>\nhomeschooling that I do with my daughter.  It&#39;s my personal philosophy, <br/>\nbut I have to recognize how much more philosophically traditional he is <br/>\nthan I.  He was born and raised in England and went to Catholic school <br/>\nin a pressed uniform.  Even though that experience left him <br/>\nunimpressed, it still seemed to imprint him with the need for school as <br/>\nan institution.  Go figure.<br/>\nControlling and dictatorship?  Mine too.  I catch myself looking the <br/>\nother way.  He has so many other fine, loving  qualities but  I don&#39;t <br/>\nsuppose he could ever unlearn these negative ones - they seem pretty <br/>\ninherent in his nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nCynic that he is, were he to try to denigrate the ideals  that are <br/>\nclosest to my heart,  I would lose so much respect for him that I am <br/>\nnot sure I could really recover.  Respecting each other&#39;s values and <br/>\nprinciples is just so important, even in disagreement.   So, not being <br/>\ninclined to flirt with that kind of disaster,  I suppose I shut him out <br/>\nquite a bit.  We can bash each other&#39;s politics and religious (or lack <br/>\nthereof) ideologies in safety and no harm done.  It&#39;s like for sport.  <br/>\nThis is different.  Would he know enough to know the difference?  That <br/>\nhow I choose to educate my daughter is sacred ground to me?  That this <br/>\nis where I choose to invest my energy, my time, and my love?<br/>\n<br/>\nHis work pays the bills, so it is therefore automatically important and <br/>\nvalid.

It&#39;s remarkable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one catch.  The one person that I can&#39;t get to relate to me <br/>\nor the kids is Pat.  Slowly, I have been sharing bits and pieces of <br/>\nthings I have been learning.  I&#39;ve mostly been sharing things that <br/>\ndirectly effect our way of living in relation to home and job.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to read at all.  The only thing he does read is <br/>\ninstruction manuals and information of such related to vehicle <br/>\nrepair.  He&#39;s a transmission mechanic by trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to figure out what my question is...I guess I just want to <br/>\nknow if anyone else has a husband that is clueless about unschooling <br/>\nand that way of life yet you are living it with your children.  If <br/>\nso, how do you do it?  Do you think it&#39;s possible to live in such a <br/>\nway?  How do you share information with someone you love that very <br/>\nmuch raises the children in a very &quot;old school&quot; kind of way so to <br/>\nspeak?  Pat is very controlling and dictatorship like with the kids.  <br/>\nI am not that way and am leaning even further away from that end of <br/>\nthe spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, how I wish I had known about homeschooling and unschooling 15 <br/>\nyears ago.  It would have been an amazing thing for us all.  Well, <br/>\nyou know what they say about that 20/20 vision thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":328,"nextTopicId":169}}
