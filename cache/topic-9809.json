With expression!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne didn&#39;t learn to read at all until she was pushing 8 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15 and 18, they read equally well and enjoy a lot of the same  <br/>\nbooks. Roxana (the earlier reader) is a bit more extensively hooked  <br/>\ninto the world of literature - Rosie is more physical - plays soccer,  <br/>\ndoes karate, has been playing Dance Dance Revolution for the past  <br/>\nhalf hour. But, on the other hand, recently she made a list of what  <br/>\nshe considers &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; books - for her friends. And she thinks  <br/>\nshe might want to be a librarian - she has worked  for an hour a week  <br/>\nin the public library for over a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say that those who read earlier have an advantage - but  <br/>\nthey might turn out to be kids who are always really really into  <br/>\nreading. I mean kids who ON THEIR OWN read early, of course, not  <br/>\nthose forced to learn before they&#39;d have naturally wanted to. This is  <br/>\nno different than other things kids show an early interest in - my  <br/>\nnephew showed an early interest in ball games - any kind of ball  <br/>\ngames - he just wanted to kick and throw balls for hours - since  <br/>\nbefore he could walk. So - he&#39;s 12 and still really loves to play ball.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who read later might have some advantages, too, though. I have  <br/>\nobserved that they often develop their other learning modes more than  <br/>\nother kids who read earlier, especially those who were schooled/ <br/>\ntaught/coerced into learning to read early. I know a kid who didn&#39;t  <br/>\nread until 12/13 or so - but his ability to listen to verbal  <br/>\ninformation, sort it out, keep it in his mind, etc., is truly  <br/>\nremarkable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOT that college success is the way to measure the value of  <br/>\neverything - but it might be useful to think about college and what  <br/>\nis really useful there.  I mean, what do most college classes  <br/>\ninvolve? Listening to lectures. Good setup for the kid who has great  <br/>\nlistening skills!<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]  Learning to read was ...Knowing when to offer info and when to bite your tongue","postDate":"1139324674","msgId":9861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMjA3MTUwNDM0LjMyNDg2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMxOTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2RDNERkUxLTQ4QTMtNEVDMy05QzM4LUFGMDA3OUIwQjc3MUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":9852,"nextInTopic":9880,"prevInTime":9860,"nextInTime":9862,"topicId":9809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She s a singer and actress - just got a big part in the college musical.

When they ask you - doesn&#39;t sound like she was asking  <br/>\nfor help, she was showing you what SHE had learned on her own. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nundermine that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would sometimes say, &quot;Wow. I&#39;m impressed with what you&#39;ve figured  <br/>\nout. That is very cool. If you ever want me to help you figure out  <br/>\nanything, just let me know.&quot; But - now I know even THAT wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessary - it isn&#39;t like my kids wouldn&#39;t already know that I&#39;d help  <br/>\nthem if they wanted help, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to ask Roxana, when she was as young as 6 or 7, if she wanted  <br/>\npiano lessons. She was happily learning to play, on her own, by  <br/>\nfiguring things out for herself, over a period of years. Once she  <br/>\nlooked oddly at me and said, &quot;Okay Mom do you think I don&#39;t KNOW that  <br/>\nthere are such things as piano lessons? I will let you know if I ever  <br/>\nwant to take lessons, okay?&quot;  As a college student she signed up for  <br/>\na couple of semesters of piano class - filled in a bunch of little  <br/>\nthings she hadn&#39;t ever learned on her own, had fun. She&#39;s not a great  <br/>\npiano player, but she&#39;s very comfortable with music. She&#39;s a singer  <br/>\nand actress - just got a big part in the college musical. All those  <br/>\nyears of fooling around with the piano make her an unusually good  <br/>\nsight reader which means she auditions really well - when they hand  <br/>\nher new music to learn in a few minutes, she&#39;s fine with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Knowing when to offer info and when to bite your tongue","postDate":"1139155462","msgId":9811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRzNTdtNisxMjRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9809,"nextInTopic":9824,"prevInTime":9810,"nextInTime":9812,"topicId":9809,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So Im just wondering at what point if ever do you offer information about whatever subject they are currently interested in?
