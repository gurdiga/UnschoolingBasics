It&#39;s like school is at the center, contained in a building  <br/>\nand textbooks, but homeschooling reaches beyond the building for  <br/>\nbetter materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling throws away that model. It&#39;s living as though school  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is like a diorama of the (supposed) important parts of the  <br/>\nforest. Unschooling is the real forest for kids to explore in any  <br/>\ndirection and any order they want. They can focus on one area. They  <br/>\ncan dabble throughout the forest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wants to unschool in the school yard, it would be better to  <br/>\nsee that as eclectic homeschooling. They would have much better advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone wants reassurance that unschooled kids can do fine in  <br/>\nschool, my daughter had no problems with the college math and one  <br/>\nwriting classes she took starting at 14. She said she had problems  <br/>\nwith arithmetic since she didn&#39;t have all the facts memorized but the  <br/>\nrest of it she did fine on with basically only video games and real  <br/>\nlife math (and parents who talk about math occasionally). By the end  <br/>\nof the first class she had practiced enough to get speedier at  <br/>\narithmetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the biggest reassurance is that it only takes weeks or months  <br/>\nto catch on to what they need to know for the classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348218801,"authorName":"Rachelle Marsden","from":"Rachelle Marsden &lt;overhereinheaven@...&gt;","profile":"musicgluttony","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Transitioning from unschooling to school","postDate":"1272828929","msgId":43836,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAyemJjY2YyYjM1MTAwNTAyMTIzNW42NTUxYjk0OHBlM2Q4YTdkZmU2NWU0MjljQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43837,"prevInTime":43835,"nextInTime":43837,"topicId":43836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone I work with unschooling and passion-led families on their journeys and a question has come up a few times lately and I don t have many experiences","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-247170192\">Hi Everyone<br/>\nI work with unschooling and passion-led families on their journeys and a<br/>\nquestion has come up a few times lately and I don&#39;t have many experiences to<br/>\ngo off of for an answer...<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething along the lines of &quot;I do want to stay more or less in the general<br/>\nlearning area for her age, if I can,  so that if she decides to go to public<br/>\nschool (which she might, at any time) the transition will be smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if people could give input on fully unschooled children who<br/>\nchoose to try out public school - what have you seen happen?
