They&#39;re outgrowing little-kid stuff but don&#39;t know what they want Next. So it can help a lot to offer new things, rather than just looking at pre-existing interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are all sorts of idea lists here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;m the working parent, one of the ways I contribute to regular strewing is to buy new things - books, games, video games, movies, toys... I try to get something new every week in part because we only have one reliable car, so my 9yo doesn&#39;t get Out every week unless we do something on the weekend. Since I don&#39;t have the benefit of actually getting to see what Mo does during the day, I&#39;ve given myself a goal of one new thing to strew a week and one fabulous outting a month. If there&#39;s not interest, that&#39;s okay - we don&#39;t Have to do those things, but it helps keep things fresh and interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately the measure of &quot;am I doing enough?&quot; is to ask yourself if your kids are happy and if you can do more. The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive - looking for ways to do more is a good idea in general, to keep from getting stuck in a rut, just keep in mind its not a race to have the &quot;most enriched&quot; childhood, either. If one more outting makes your child roll her eyes and say &quot;do we Have To?&quot; then maybe it would be better to spend more time at home. If one more game or movie marathon is met with an utter lack of enthusiasm, maybe it would be better to back off a little and watch. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Still beginning","postDate":"1288029618","msgId":45008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDRDQyODU5RENDMjc0Qy0xRDlDLTZBM0B3ZWJtYWlsLW0wODIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlhM3R1aCtnZjZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlhM3R1aCtnZjZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45007,"nextInTopic":45009,"prevInTime":45007,"nextInTime":45009,"topicId":45005,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What cool things did you do/offer toDAY?

It stands to reason<br/>\nthat our children are different.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you take your daughter to events, places, activities and other cool<br/>\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your daughter have any interests?<br/>\nMy dd3 loves all things animal and Diego. She also loves to dress up in<br/>\ncostumes of animals. The way I provide for this passion is to make Diego<br/>\nvideos/shows/books/toys available to her. If I am at the shops and see<br/>\nsomething Diego or animal related that I think she might enjoy I pick it up.<br/>\nIf I see a local activity that support that interest I offer it to her. We<br/>\nplay Diego (go on adventures around our home). I watch Diego with her and we<br/>\ndiscuss it as much (or as little) as she wants.<br/>\nds7 loves video games. To support this passion we find ways to give he lots<br/>\nof space to play his games. Dh plays with him. We buy him games that he<br/>\nwants. We take him to gaming stores, conventions etc. He has a number of<br/>\ngame systems and a variety of games and access to xbox live. I pick up items<br/>\nthat are related to his favorite games when I see them (I love thrift<br/>\nshops). We recently found Halo Lego guys. So that fed two passions :-)<br/>\ndd13 loves to be around her friends to communicate and have adventures and<br/>\nmake stuff. We have made it a priority for her to have a cell phone with<br/>\nunlimited text and a bus pass for roaming the city. She has a computer with<br/>\ninternet access. I purchase her craft items she is interested in. I find<br/>\nstrange things and present them to her...sometimes she is thrilled other<br/>\ntimes uninterested. Either way is ok. We also go on many far flung<br/>\nadventures as a family with her in mind. We frequent unschooling conferences<br/>\nand I even plan stuff based on her interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just a few examples of supporting passions.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIs your child happy (in general)? Does she feel satisfied?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve moved recently (3000 miles) there was some rocky parts, to say the<br/>\nleast. There were some times our children felt unsatisfied, frustrated and<br/>\nunhappy. Their needs weren&#39;t being met. We recognized that and did what we<br/>\ncould to support them, to fill their needs and desires. That is different in<br/>\neach kid. For my dd3 it meant a lot of extra carrying in her backpack and<br/>\nmore nursing than usual. For ds7 it meant more hugs and sensory input. Lots<br/>\nmore attention for both over all. For dd13 it meant driving her to say<br/>\ngoodbye to all her east coast friends. That meant a drive from PA to MA, WV<br/>\nand MD. Plus extended local driving.<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing is another word for providing potentially interesting things for<br/>\nyou child. If you are in tune with your child you will know some things they<br/>\nenjoy. Start there. I know that my children love sensory fun, I found a<br/>\nsand/water table at the thrift store for $5! I know that this will provide<br/>\nfun all winter long. I can fill each side, there are two. I am not limited<br/>\nto sand and water. I can use shaving cream or rice or dried beans, heck I<br/>\ncould even use cooked beans :-) That&#39;s one aspect of strewing. Another is to<br/>\nfind or buy something and leave it laying about. Like throwing a new book on<br/>\nthe coffee table or shelf. If your child loves play-dough then finding<br/>\nseveral other pliable moldable mediums to work with would be strewing.<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more of a problem being interested in my own pursuits. I forget<br/>\nsometimes that I need to have my own passions. But I know that I need to<br/>\nfeed myself and I feel like it is important that my kids see adults that<br/>\nhave passion. It is normal for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Oct 25, 2010 at 5:41 AM, gcriminy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:senlin_says@...\">senlin_says@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello, everyone!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have an almost-seven-year-old.
