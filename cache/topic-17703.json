Identify what exactly about this<br/>\nbehavior or situation upsets me and work backward from the source within<br/>\nmyself.<br/>\n.........in other words....*I* am the one that needs to change my<br/>\nperspective.<br/>\nBoundaries are healthy.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t still<br/>\nprinciples and boundaries at work in the family dynamic.  The book wasn&#39;t<br/>\nspecifically an unschooling book and of course there are some things you&#39;ll<br/>\nwant to take and some you&#39;ll want to leave but I would totally recommend it<br/>\nas a good resource to begin examining yourself if that&#39;s something you are<br/>\nworking on.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to share~<br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay\">http://360.yahoo.com/dazynay</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFacing a mirror you see merely your own countenance; facing your child you<br/>\nfinally understand how everyone else has seen you.<br/>\n~Daniel Raeburn, The New Yorker, 05-01-2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17698,"nextTopicId":17653}}
