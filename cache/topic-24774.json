She wants to take her out and have her go <br/>\nelsewhere, but is  really struggling financially, can&#39;t take time off to go to <br/>\neach place...and  she&#39;s rather isolated - no network of friends and support, <br/>\nreally - not for  this, that is. If anyone can suggest anything, would you <br/>\nplease? Feel free to  keep it off the list, since it&#39;s not a homeschooling or <br/>\nunschooling question. I  just knew that you folks here are full of great info and <br/>\nideas and thought I&#39;d  toss it out here for ya&#39;ll to mull over. :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks! <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n(and friend, Lyss :) )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24662,"nextTopicId":24686}}
