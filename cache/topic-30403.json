I do consider it guest friendly too ,because the kind of people I invite over understand how clutter happens here. We have always had very small houses with lots of people living in them.My friends have never seen my house any other way!  <br/>\n   Every now and then (especially this time of year) I start to feel clutter crazy, like something desperately needs to be done. It helps me to remember that this is MY personal issue.I am the one who wants it clean ,and is therefore responsible for making it happen. In a book called Scream Free Parenting ,the author wrote that we cannot give a child a room then tell them what to do with it as if it is still ours.He recomends that if you are having trouble dealing with it go and clean your own room.(BTW this book has some things I agree with and some I don&#39;t,like setting artificial consequences)  <br/>\n   So knowing this is my problem, I will pick ONE thing that I really want to get at besides reguar dishes and laundry, like cleaning the fridge or a cluttery corner. Then when I do that one thing I feel great , my goal is accomplished!  <br/>\n   It also helps to remember that when your kids are grown, they probably won&#39;t have fond memories of watching you mop the floor, but they will remember when you played chess all day and baked cookies together!<br/>\n  -Kelly<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

This made the biggest difference for me several years ago. Basically all-natural, whole grain, low meat and dairy, lots of fresh and raw veggies, lots of fruit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen: exercise, fresh air, sunlight, SAM-e (vitamin supplement but get a good brand), B Complex (also make sure you get a good brand or you won&#39;t absorb it), St Johns Wart (carefully; it&#39;s known to affect reproduction and you can&#39;t take it while on birth control), hormone balancing thru something called Phyto-Proleaf (an all natural progesterone cream; stay away from estrogen creams/meds) and my all time saving grace for when things got really bad was Lithate. I got it from my homeopath; it&#39;s a natural form of lithium. It gave me no side effects and it worked wonderfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, meditation, positive visualization, affirmations, prayer, yoga, fung shui...just a slow transformation in thought, trying to focus and surround myself with positive and beautiful things like flowers, pictures, colors, houseplants. I battled bi-polar disorder since I was 14 (it runs in my family) and outcame it when I was 24, with only an occasional bad day a couple times a year (usually when I haven&#39;t been taking care of myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope all this helps.
