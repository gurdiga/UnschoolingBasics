I just wanted to introduce myself and I&#39;ll try to make <br/>\nit quick.  I have two children (11 yob and 7 yog) and I have been <br/>\nmarried for almost 13 years.  We have been homeschooling from the <br/>\nbeginning and for the most part we have always been very relaxed with <br/>\ntimes of radical unschooling mixed in.  I&#39;d have to say that right <br/>\nnow we are a little more eclectic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been harder for me to let go of all the schoolish looking things <br/>\nthan the chores and bedtimes and so on.  We have never had set chores <br/>\nand our bedtimes have always been flexible depending on what was <br/>\ngoing on.  I do have to admit that dh would have liked me to enforce <br/>\nchores because that&#39;s the way he grew up, but I never would agree to <br/>\nthat.  I never had chores growing up and I didn&#39;t see how having <br/>\nchores ever taught dh to be more responsible.  I did see how much he <br/>\nresented his parents though for all the controlling they did of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I should expand on what we consider schoolish looking <br/>\nthings.  Since we have always been very relaxed, we have done very <br/>\nlittle with workbooks and we&#39;ve never used textbooks at all.  I have <br/>\nnever used a phonics program or readers to teach reading.  I have <br/>\nread things like A Child&#39;s History of the World, Christian Liberty <br/>\nNature Readers, and classic children&#39;s literature to my children.  I <br/>\nalso read things they want me to read.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the time I am reading they are free to play quietly if they <br/>\nchoose.  Many times I would start reading to them and they would play <br/>\nquietly but before long they would be in my lap looking at pictures <br/>\nor just cuddling while I read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe play all sorts of games when I feel like I need to see some math <br/>\npractice like Monopoly, chess, checkers, and Yahtzee.  I have a hard <br/>\ntime just letting go of some idea I have that we need to practice <br/>\nevery so often.

Thre is nothig to be gained by waiting. They are just gettigng more and more school orientated which takes ages to shake off the longer they stay in.  It is telling my youngest two have never been to school and have a completely different attitude to learning than the others who did.
