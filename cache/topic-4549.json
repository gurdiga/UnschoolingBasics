Chatted <br/>\nwith folks at the pool and the play room.<br/>\n<br/>\nPopped in on a couple of speaker sessions while DS and DH were up in <br/>\nthe room watching a movie. Oh and I also couldn&#39;t resist popping in <br/>\non the foster puppy funshop and getting to be near a pup for a while <br/>\n(since our two dogs had to stay home with a sitter).<br/>\n<br/>\nDH stayed for the whole Talent Show on Sunday night - DS and I <br/>\nwaited to hear Anne Ohman and clan perform the song Shaving Cream <br/>\n(one of our favorite ditties) then we went to the pool for several <br/>\nhours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to out dinner one evening and I had wonderful plate of <br/>\nravioli stuffed with squash in a wonderful sauce. At the next table <br/>\nat Capone&#39;s was another unschooling family which was cool - don&#39;t <br/>\nexperience that every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went on the whale watch appended to the end of the conference and <br/>\nthat was great - lots of people all mingling and chatting. One girl <br/>\nwe had spent time with at the pool saw that DS was chilly (despite <br/>\nhis jacket) and went and brought a blanket over that they could <br/>\nshare. It was a really special blanket to her from when she was <br/>\nlittle and she freely shared it - that was cool! We shared some of <br/>\nour &quot;ogre mix&quot; snack with her - instead of mixing up the &quot;trail mix&quot; <br/>\n(nuts, giant M&Ms, raisins, Cherrios, etc) we just layer them (ogres <br/>\nhave layers ...) and dig in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ate at the dockside seafood restaurant afterward and the place <br/>\nwas brim full of unschoolers which was really cool. Didn&#39;t stay to <br/>\nsee Whoopi though - we were heading home and wanted to get back <br/>\nbefore it was too terribly late.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s totally unlike anything schoolish, not even like a <br/>\nhomeschooling convention where you sit and listen to people explain <br/>\nhow to get your kids to ... and browse through tons of curriculum <br/>\nvendors. The only vendors there had some really neat stuff (like <br/>\npercussion instruments and craft materials), no &quot;school in a box&quot; <br/>\nstuff anywhere. There are no &quot;shoulds&quot; only opportunities and <br/>\noptions. If you want, you can consider it a really cool vacation and <br/>\njust take advantage of the discount hotel rate - but then you&#39;d miss <br/>\na lot of the fun stuff from just mingling around and seeing what <br/>\ntranspires.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Conference question","postDate":"1104952279","msgId":4565,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyaGU0bit0ODBnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNyZmtycys2dWNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4558,"nextInTopic":4566,"prevInTime":4564,"nextInTime":4566,"topicId":4549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... will ...
