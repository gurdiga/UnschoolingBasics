She died at home and all the children were (temporarily) living with her at the time. The youngest of them definitely coped better at the time of her mother&#39;s death and has continued to do so. My son who was 8 at the time stayed with me as I dealt with the funeral directors and supervised her body being removed from the home. I believe it gave him a sense of acceptance and closure to know exactly what was happening. Whereas the other children chose to go away and the 19 year old daughter was forced (by her father) to because she didn&#39;t want to let them take her mother. Personally, I wish he hadn&#39;t been in such a rush to get the funeral director there (they were not married and had not been for a long time) and had let the girls properly farewell their mother.

I don&#39;t know why I cared that much about<br/>\ngoing, as I hadn&#39;t seen her very often, but it&#39;s one of very few<br/>\nmemories I have from when I was a young kid, so I guess I must have<br/>\nbeen rather upset they didn&#39;t let me go. In other words, your son will<br/>\nlikely be upset if you don&#39;t let him go, so what does it matter then in<br/>\nthe end?

I am worried it is going to upset him. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Was there anything special about her that was upsetting, or was she<br/>\njust like any other dead person? If there was something special, I&#39;d<br/>\ntell him and ask him whether he&#39;d still want to see her, but if there<br/>\nwas nothing special... I don&#39;t see much of a reason for not allowing<br/>\nhim to see her.  Something that&#39;s upsetting to you is not necessarily<br/>\nupsetting to a 10yo. You might be more aware of your mortality and be<br/>\nreminded by it, whereas he might not even think of his own mortality<br/>\n(then and again, he might, just saying that it&#39;s hard to tell). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know that the <br/>\n&gt; unschooling philosophy is to let kids make the judgment calls, but if<br/>\n&gt; he has never seen a dead person, he has no idea what it will be like.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s gotta be a first at some point.

Of course, if he&#39;s easily<br/>\nbothered by scary movies and such, you might want to remind him of that<br/>\nto check whether he really wants to see her, but I think he&#39;d be fine.<br/>\nWhat is y&#39;all&#39;s philosophy on what happens after you die? Might be a<br/>\ngood time to discuss that after the funeral, if that might help comfort<br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I find myself wanting to protect him from bad things that he will<br/>\n&gt; most likely encounter during life for as long as possible.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She was 102 and had Alzheimers...

And who knows,<br/>\nshe might be in a better place now (I&#39;m an agnostic). <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I think the more you act as if he might be upset by it, the<br/>\nmore upset he might end up being upset by it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen and again, what do I know?

More and more, when I have questions  regarding <br/>\nparenting, I turn to this list for  advice~<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I am sorry for your loss! Secondly, I  PROMISE your child will <br/>\nhandle seeing the funeral way better than any  adult there, including you! <br/>\nChildren do great with death, then they learn  later (from adults) to freak out <br/>\nabout it. I am the director of music at a  Catholic Church and sing at a ton of <br/>\nfunerals every year and the  children attending are always the ones that do <br/>\nthe best and handle  things the most spiritually. All ends create a beginning.  <br/>\nIn other words there can&#39;t be any end to something without there  also being <br/>\na start. Death is as normal a part of life as birth and  you would probably <br/>\nlet your children see someone born (if that is what  they wanted) right? Death <br/>\nis simply a transformation of the soul. I  don&#39;t know what faith (if any) you <br/>\nbelong to or practice, but even if you  are agnostic or an atheist, you can <br/>\nfind this truth simply by looking at  nature - nothing can go on without death / <br/>\ntransformation of some  kind. A caterpillar changes into a butterfly. The <br/>\ncaterpillar part of its  life is over and a new life begins with wings. When you <br/>\nput a potato  in the ground and bury it deep, the potato rots away, dies and <br/>\nthe  remains re-sprout. The very next year there will be new little potatoes.  <br/>\nIf the winter is especially bad and the ground freezes up very  deeply, thus <br/>\nsaving the potato, keeping it in a stage of  half-aliveness (nature&#39;s life <br/>\nsupport, LOL!) then no new life will  come and there will be no new little <br/>\npotatoes. We don&#39;t know exactly  what new life and transformation happens. Some of us <br/>\nare content with just  saying &quot;there will be a new beginning for this soul of <br/>\nsome kind&quot; and  others are very set in believing it goes a certain way with <br/>\nsaints,  angels, heaven, etc... Because of my job, we know people in the  <br/>\nfuneral business and I think that has made some aspects of death,  funerals, <br/>\nembalming, etc...fascinating but also sometimes almost comical  to my kids because of <br/>\nthe stories they hear. For example, a man at a local  funeral home told us <br/>\nrecently that the family of the deceased had the dead  woman&#39;s colors done (you <br/>\nknow; are you a &quot;winter, summer, spring,  etc..&quot;) because she wanted to do it <br/>\nwhile alive and didn&#39;t get around  to it and they wanted her makeup and <br/>\nclothing to match her season scheme.  My children understood that this was obviously <br/>\n&quot;temporary insanity from  grief.&quot; They also know that it is culturally <br/>\nimportant for people to bury  their loved ones, have ceremonies, sing songs, and <br/>\ngather together for  support. If I were you I truly would have no worries.<br/>\nSorry this was long! <br/>\nAgain, I hope your journey through this loss is full of  good memories, love <br/>\nand support,<br/>\nAdriana<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282257979,"authorName":"Wildflower Car","from":"&quot;Wildflower Car&quot; &lt;unschoolfool@...&gt;","profile":"red_olive5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] child attending funeral?","postDate":"1170042677","msgId":21101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTctRjlGN0VGNzQxQjg1MjM1QkFEQkI5N0NBQTcwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVwam9xbCtmdjlrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21100,"nextInTopic":21104,"prevInTime":21100,"nextInTime":21102,"topicId":21099,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If my children want to go to a funeral.

I personally don&#39;t think funerals for people who lived for more <br/>\nthan a hundred years are as upsetting as those for people whose lives were <br/>\ncut short unexpectedly.  It sounds to me like great-great grandma lived a long, <br/>\nhopefully happy life and death is a natural part of that.  I find that <br/>\nfunerals help me grieve and being with a group of people who also loved the person <br/>\nhelps.  Its a time to reminisce together about the deceased person&#39;s life and <br/>\naccomplishments.  I think by not letting your son be a part of that, it may <br/>\nupset him forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may help you feel better if you have a plan in place in case your son gets <br/>\nreally upset.  Also keep in mind that many people attending the funeral may <br/>\nbe upset and that can sometimes be more upsetting than seeing the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace to you and your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":75406115,"authorName":"Beth Mouser","from":"&quot;Beth Mouser&quot; &lt;mouser4@...&gt;","profile":"mouser4983703","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"child attending funeral?","postDate":"1170040469","msgId":21099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwam9xbCtmdjlrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21100,"prevInTime":21098,"nextInTime":21100,"topicId":21099,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 10-year-old son recently lost his great, great grand-mother who was 102 1/2 (pretty special, huh).
