Reading them gives me such encouragement and support.  I am also grateful for everyone who answers my specific questions with such thoughtful responses.  Mmmmmmm!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I heard my kids talking things out and finding solutions together to what ever problems were coming up.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I helped my husband deal with a work issue for nearly an hour while my kids played together and ate together.
