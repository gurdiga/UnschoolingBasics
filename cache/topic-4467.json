We are a Pagan/Christian blended family.  On the Solstice, dh was traveling.  So the kids and I spent the day without electric lights to enjoy the darkness.

It is really cold for Texas so the kids are spending a lot of time indoors which is unusual for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, we went out to eat and then down to the River Walk in San Antonio to see it decorated with lights.  Since it was so cold, it wasn&#39;t crowded and the kids could have more &quot;elbow-room.&quot;  There is an outdoor theatre there that the kids love to play on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe noticed an entire group of policemen there and soon found out that one was going to surprise his girlfriend (who was riding a tourist boat) with a marriage proposal.  The kids loved that so we stuck around (my 11yo has recently discovered girls and was very interested to see how this was done)and got to see the young officer go down on his knee to ask her and her tears of joy.
