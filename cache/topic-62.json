I guess I feel the need to prove <br/>\nthat we have &quot;done school&quot;. My husband and his father are very <br/>\nconcerned about if the kids are learning. My mom thinks I should put <br/>\nmy kids in PS and be a teachers helper. &quot;thanks mom&quot; But I do have to <br/>\ntell you all a really neat thing. My oldest daughter wanted to <br/>\nrent &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; we did and I found a lesson guide for it <br/>\nonline. Well last night I gave them the background info on the movie <br/>\nand we watched it, even our energetic 4yr old watched it. Well all <br/>\nday today  our 13yr and 11 yr girls have been playing playstation, <br/>\nthey are trying to figure out how to upgrade their race cars and what <br/>\nthey really need. They have been singing songs from that movie ALL <br/>\nday at the top of their lungs!! I am watching it again in the other <br/>\nroom with our 4yr old and all of this music is a bit much. But I am <br/>\nso glad that they enjoy it so much. <br/>\n Also I have given our girls a job. On day that I work they can help <br/>\nme and I will pay them $5 per hour. They both think this is great and <br/>\nwe are putting together a log for them to keep record of their hours. <br/>\nI only use them maybe 1-2 hours so it is cheap help for me and I <br/>\nreally need their help. <br/>\n Today I have decided to many people need new clothes in our house <br/>\nand i have asked the girls to help me figure out exactally what <br/>\neveryone needs and in what order things need bought. They think this <br/>\nis great because it has to do with clothes. Of coarse they are both <br/>\non the top of the list.<br/>\n I guess I woory mostly about our oldest because I am kind of <br/>\nlearning as I go with her. She is really a wonderful person.<br/>\n Thank you for being supportive people, sometime I just need to hear <br/>\nthat others believe children learn from the world and not what paper <br/>\nwork they can get done.:)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jami<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; <br/>\n&lt;skreams@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;but of coarse math needs to be done<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **Hi Jami - We&#39;ve never &#39;done math&#39;, so I question that &quot;of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>course&quot; :0).

My oldest still of &quot;schooling age&quot; is 14.  Here&#39;s what she&#39;s <br/>\nbeen up to.  She takes jazz dance and fashion illustration through <br/>\nthe &quot;kids college&quot; at the community college here.  That has led her <br/>\nto - wanting to take a choreography class available this summer AND <br/>\nshe discovered a fascination with wedding dresses in the fashion <br/>\nclass which has further led her to an interest in wedding planning.  <br/>\nSO... she&#39;s taken it upon herself to find out about small business <br/>\nmanagement since wedding planners are independent contractors - has <br/>\nstudied accounting and management and budgeting on her own via books <br/>\nand the internet (there are free accounting classes online if you <br/>\nsearch).  She also wants to enter the &quot;bridge&quot; program at the <br/>\ncollege - allows high school age kids to take college classes.  She <br/>\nwants to sign up for small biz mgmt (plenty of math!) and psychology <br/>\nor sociology (or both) since wedding planning requires you work well <br/>\nwith people... etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nso I guess after all that what I&#39;m saying is this - do let your <br/>\ndaughter follow her interests and you&#39;ll both be surprised where it <br/>\nlands her!  And give it some time.  My daughter spent nearly a year <br/>\ndoing little besides dancing and reading and writing stories - which <br/>\nwas all great with me.  It&#39;s fascinating how it evolves when you <br/>\njust let it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":114745378,"authorName":"jamihelm","from":"&quot;jamihelm&quot; &lt;helmonthehill@...&gt;","profile":"jamihelm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"High school","postDate":"1085844046","msgId":62,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5YTlvZStxc2dtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66,"prevInTime":61,"nextInTime":63,"topicId":62,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not really an unschooler, but I am not a text book /work book style either.

I do basically let my children pick what they want to <br/>\nlearn about, but of coarse math needs to be done. We don&#39;t always do <br/>\nit. I find that we are all very bored with workbooks and if they help <br/>\nme figure how much we have to spend at the store or helping with our <br/>\nhome business, they learn much more practical things. Well my oldest <br/>\nis 13yrs and I would like to get some opinions on schooling at this <br/>\nlevel. I want her to be intelligent and there is a lot out there to <br/>\ndo BUT, I don&#39;t want to stuff her with unimportant junk. What are <br/>\nsome others doing about kids this age. Also what about high school <br/>\nand college? What do you do for record keeping and such things?<br/>\n--Jami</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":109,"nextTopicId":24}}
