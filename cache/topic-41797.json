You may be able to beat them to the punch and avoid the battle.  Here in Louisiana it is a matter of very little time without contact and or support that has to go by for a parent to be charged with abandonment.  Not as in they get legal charges pressed on them, but they no longer have rights to the child.  Also, whoever files for custody first has temporary custody until it goes to court.  That may be a murky part for you being an aunt even if the laws are the same there, but it is worth looking into because someone filing papers before you may be the difference between fighting to keep him and fighting to get him back.  There may be people in this group who have dealt with this before who could offer specific advice, but my first thought is that you should try at all costs to avoid making it about defending your philosophy and more about proving that you aren&#39;t breaking any laws.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dianne &lt;charitycrafter@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is not a divorce situation.

It is<br/>\nthe most likely scenario...<br/>\nSo, I would ask first - who is seeking custody (potentially) of you child?<br/>\nIf it is a parent, does that parent currently have custodial rights and is<br/>\nthat parent currently actively involved in your child&#39;s life?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you have to &quot;prove&quot; is very different depending on who is challenging<br/>\nyour life and rights.  If it is anyone other than someone with a current<br/>\ncustodial or biological parental rights, the threshold to mess up your life<br/>\nis WAY higher... i.e. what they have to prove is pretty much abuse to a<br/>\ndegree necessary to remove your rights.  If we are talking about a co-parent<br/>\nor co-custody holder (currently married to you or not), then it is a much<br/>\nmore significant thing and you are probably going to have to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really comes down to the fact that in our legal system we believe that<br/>\nthe sanctity of parental rights is something you do not mess with without a<br/>\ndarn good reason.  Now, we all know of anecdotal stories to the contrary,<br/>\nbut the prominent thrust of our jurisprudence is to keep families in tact<br/>\nand to uphold parental rights unless you can show a good reason (or cause)<br/>\nnot to.  This is why most states now assume 50/50 split at divorce as well.<br/>\nBoth parents parental rights are important and must be left intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all being said, judges are people and family law differs by the state.<br/>\nSo, if a case is actually filed against you, then I would use any and every<br/>\nresource at your disposal to fight it from day one.

If you haven&#39;t been keeping pretty detailed records (or psychological assessments) of &quot;progress&quot; then that&#39;s going to go against you in court. Courts also tend to side with a parent who is going to keep, or put, a child in school as opposed to the opposite. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it necessary for you to get divorced? Can you stay together and avoid the whole mess? Alternately, can you agree to a custody and educational plan yourselves, before going to court? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to &quot;win&quot; a custody battle with a background of radical unschooling you will likely have to make a lot of compromises. When my partner was working on his own divorce he agreed to a great many compromises right away to avoid dragging his son through the courts. He agreed to have his son put in public school, knowing that was something we might be able to change later, and we have. His son now lives with us and unschools (although the custody agreement still says he lives with his mom!). Time creates new options.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its at all possible for you to stay together (no abuse, no mentally unstable partner), do it. It will probably still mean some compromises, though, in order for that to work. Unschooling across a divorce is messy business on a good day. Although my stepson is unschooled, his bio mom still pulls a lot of strings in his life - emotional strings, mostly, but also some logisitical strings. Regardless of your feelings toward your husband, he will remain a part of your life for several more years, regardless of custody arrangements. He&#39;s a part of your son&#39;s life, after all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":233441857,"authorName":"Dianne","from":"Dianne &lt;charitycrafter@...&gt;","profile":"angels_heart82","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Legal concerns","postDate":"1255080910","msgId":41797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFiYmQ1ZGU2MDkxMDA5MDIzNWsyMGE2Y2FjOG5jYmNhY2VhMTAyMDhiM2U3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41804,"prevInTime":41796,"nextInTime":41798,"topicId":41797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I need some advice.

There is a long and interesting story that I am not<br/>\ngoing to get into, but there is a possibility that I may be facing a custody<br/>\nissue. It seems the main thing that will be used against me is unschooling.<br/>\nThere are some in my family who feel that Jeremy, 12, is not learning<br/>\nanything which is completely untrue. He is autistic and has a unique<br/>\nlearning style so he is probably behind other kids his age. For example, it<br/>\nhas been brought up that he doesn&#39;t know his multiplication tables. Part of<br/>\nthat is due to the way he learns and part of it is that he hasn&#39;t been<br/>\ninterested in doing it yet. He does understand the concept of<br/>\nmultiplication. I am being told that if he doesn&#39;t learn multiplication now<br/>\nhe never will, won&#39;t be able to or won&#39;t want to I guess<br/>\n<br/>\n I can&#39;t pull out any school records to prove anything. How do I explain all<br/>\nthe things that I am not doing and all the school stuff that has not been<br/>\nforced on him and that I don&#39;t make a bunch of rules or try to punish him to<br/>\nchange his behavior. It seems to other people that I am not doing anything<br/>\nwith him and ruining his potential. I was told that the way I am doing<br/>\nthings he will end up being a janitor because he will have no education.<br/>\nThey feel I am not doing what is best for him because I am not doing things<br/>\nthe traditionally accepted way. How do I prove that unschooling works and I<br/>\nam not just neglecting his education and I am not failing to teach him<br/>\n&quot;responsibility&quot; because I don&#39;t make him do stuff he doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>\nlike go to school. I have been told everyone has to do things they don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do and the right thing to do would be to teach him that now by<br/>\nmaking him go to school. I don&#39;t believe that but a lot of people do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people start asking Jeremy a bunch of school stuff to test what he knows,<br/>\nI know he is not going to answer and give the impression that he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow anything. I am being told that if he doesn&#39;t learn multiplication now<br/>\nhe never will, won&#39;t be able to or won&#39;t want to I guess. Jeremy reads well,<br/>\nwrites comic strips, is an artist, cooks, likes science and building things,<br/>\nloves cats, has a guitar, fixes all kinds of things, is interested in<br/>\ngenetics, thinks about a lot of things and asks a lot of questions. He knows<br/>\nsome math that he has figured out on his own. I have a degree in biology and<br/>\none son is a physics major and one knows everything about computers so he is<br/>\nexposed to a lot of things from our interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is a the go to school and get socialized thing (supposedly the<br/>\nonly way). He has one close kid friend that he plays with and other kids<br/>\nthat he plays with off and on in the neighborhood. Because of his autism his<br/>\nsocial skills are not the best but he has come a long way. He has a very<br/>\nclose relationship with one of my adult sons who teaches him all kinds of<br/>\nthings. He has adult friends and kid friends in the neighborhood, including<br/>\na three year old and the three year old&#39;s dad so I think he is doing okay.<br/>\nAge is not an issue for who he likes to spend time with. But I still keep<br/>\nhearing about how he needs to go to school for the socialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is everyone in my family. No one understands what I am doing (and only<br/>\none person has even asked me to explain what I am doing) and they think I am<br/>\ndoing nothing and Jeremy is learning nothing. I wouldn&#39;t have even known<br/>\nanything about someone in my family wanting to take Jeremy if one of my sons<br/>\nhadn&#39;t told me, basically as a warning to change what I am doing while I<br/>\nstill can. I don&#39;t want to change what I am doing, especially for a fear<br/>\nbased reason.
