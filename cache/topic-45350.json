Pastas, fun cereals, baked goods? Baked goods, homemade cookies and cakes in particular, are a pretty big staple in my house, one of my &quot;go tos&quot; when I start to panic about what my dd, especially eats (she has an itty bitty apetite And a very conservative palatte, sometimes I swear this kid lives on milk and sunshine...new food this season: cinnamon). If she&#39;s solid on wanting chips, chips, chips, look for ways to add a little extra interest and variety - does she like dips and sauces for them? Make lots of those. Try fun things like using pureed veggies (baby food works well for this) for alternative &quot;ketchups&quot;. Does she like them fried in particular? She may be needing more fat than she can get in other foods, so look for other ways to offer her more fat - smoothies and yogurts, for instance, or lots of cheesy and creamy dips and spreads. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, it can help a lot to look at beverages as food, too. If she&#39;s eating mostly chips but drinks plenty of milk and juice, she&#39;s getting her nutritional needs met in a way that works for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing to keep in mind, though, is that if you&#39;ve pulled in the reigns on food before she&#39;s going to be more inclined to binge every time the reigns are let out. It can be better to wait out a period of binging and start from a whole new place, emotionally and psychologically, rather than replaying the same old scenario over again. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Learning math vs. Learning reading","postDate":"1291480022","msgId":45370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkZHE0bStjYWpnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4RDZGMTMzLURCQkItNDMzRS04REEzLTREQjA4Njg0QThFMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":45369,"nextInTopic":45371,"prevInTime":45369,"nextInTime":45371,"topicId":45350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** That s a fairly common problem that comes up when transitioning from elementary mathematics as taught in schools to algebra, because the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1348595435\">Tessa &lt;kitty_angel@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have always been pretty good at math, until eighth grade when I started algebra 1.

So learning algebra, you essentially start over, re-learning the format of mathematics entirely. As I said, lots and lots of people get stuck here and simply get through using the same elemenatry principles of... er... &quot;plug and chug&quot; - they memorize as much as they can and apply it blindly - and get out of math as fast as they can convinced they&#39;re &quot;bad at math&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people have a natural intuitive grasp of algebraic thinking that survives early indoctrination - whether by luck or being &quot;bad at&quot; the plug and chug method or simply having a higher degree of mathematical affinity overall. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve gone in for extra help, but I cannot grasp any of the concepts....

We&#39;re not all carbon copies of the same person, after all ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, kids who learn math without being taught tend to think algebraically much more easily than people taught math in school. Schools teach probably the most non-intuitive way of performing calculations and somehow manage to make it illogical too.

No one had to teach you. You watched, you tried  <br/>\nthings out, you go feedback, you tried again. That&#39;s how we naturally  <br/>\nlearn by pulling sense from how the real world acts and reacts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut math instruction pulls math out of the world and, so doing, strips  <br/>\nit of meaning. It would be like teaching a toddler to speak by getting  <br/>\nit to memorize isolated words and sentence structure and expecting  <br/>\nthat to give them enough understanding to eventually speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s meaningless to add 1.29 + 3.29. 12.5% of 17.49 is meaningless.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s as meaningless as &quot;The cat sat on the mat,&quot; when there is no cat  <br/>\nand is no mat.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal world math helps us understand the world better so we can make  <br/>\ndecisions. Do I have enough to get the fries with that? Should the  <br/>\nsupports be 3&quot; or 3&#39;? How can I hit these 5 stores in as little time  <br/>\nas possible? How much tip should I leave?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve written about math instruction a fair bit at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nscroll down the left side to the math section.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a very small fraction of people who actually grasp math from  <br/>\nclassroom instruction. They&#39;re like the people who recreate a dance by  <br/>\nwatching it. They just need a nudge in the right direction to grasp  <br/>\nthe concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people who get math in school, like me, pick up on the patterns  <br/>\nand can reproduce them, but don&#39;t necessarily grasp the underlying  <br/>\nconcepts. It&#39;s messing around with patterns. I have a degree in  <br/>\nengineering and it wasn&#39;t until college that I had that aha moment of  <br/>\nunderstanding that multiplication was repeated addition. It wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nuntil well after college that, without doing any additional math, that  <br/>\nI was finally able to grasp what they were talking about because I was  <br/>\nunderstanding real life and seeing how math fit the problem rather  <br/>\nthan the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots and lots of people expect to understand what they&#39;re doing in  <br/>\nmath and get frustrated and start to feel stupid at math when that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen. And they really shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s really really hard to  <br/>\nabsorb abstract concepts when you haven&#39;t had enough experience with  <br/>\nreal life to understand what you&#39;d want to know about situations and  <br/>\nwhy.<br/>\n<br/>\nA tutor who is good at translating the abstract into real life  <br/>\nexamples could be helpful.

She also ate bacon, garpes and carrots.<br/>\nI found out that rationalizing a food they are into only makes that food scarce <br/>\nand desired.<br/>\n Of course I cannot predict what they will want  and we may run out or not have <br/>\nsomething. But if I notice something it in the top of the list than we get lots <br/>\nof it.

My eldest would eat a lot of chocolate bars. He started to gain weight. It freaked me out, so what I did (and still do, but gradually letting it go) is going to the supermarket myself. I know what they like to eat and I will buy it. But not 20 chocolate bars per person per week anymore. They can eat what they want and how much they want, and I don&#39;t mind buying them something when we&#39;re out. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I need to do this gradually. That&#39;s not my nature, but these things are big for me, this is not how I was brought up! Too much to let go at once (also for my husband&#39;s sake ;)).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has said something like: read a little, let it sink in, apply, read a little bit more, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is very true for me....<br/>\n<br/>\nGroetjes, Mirjam :o), mv Adam (9), Boaz (6) en Levi (3).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.leermeer.blogspot.com\">http://www.leermeer.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;livwithroz&quot; &lt;livwithroz@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve recently let go of control of my kids meals.

It&#39;s funny you said some kids won&#39;t go for gradual because my Liv has picked up on it right from the beginning and we never had discussions about changing things. Except I told her no more phonics and math-u-see.  This evening we were watching a movie while her sister and father were conked out beside us. I was responding to a reply and she asked what I was doing. I told her it was about getting encouragement for the new way is schooling and eating. There was no discussion but when I tucked her into bed she said,&quot;About this new eating thing... I think I will have your chicken soup every day at the end of the day.&quot; I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll follow through but I appreciate her thoughts because it&#39;s obvious she knows how I feel about her flour, ketchup, maple syrup eating habits! Like this morning she said,&quot; I know when I ask for maple syrup you will have hard feelings. And that makes me feel sad. &quot; I said I&#39;m sorry that makes you feel sad and she gave me a great big hug. I thanked her for telling me her feelings. I know she&#39;s very in tune with me and that&#39;s part of why she&#39;s probably so extreme in many things. But I do think it will be ok, better than ok. I think she could be the balanced person I wish I could be. And maybe she&#39;ll help me to feel that way too!

Tell me where I&#39;m wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, my children do not always share my specific values but we<br/>\nhave some commonalities (like being free to choose the foods we love).  I<br/>\nthink my children have a deep respect and acceptance of my beliefs and of me<br/>\nas a person because I don&#39;t expect them to believe what I believe and I<br/>\naccept and support them in finding, creating and adapting their own values<br/>\nand choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFlour and ketchup may not be &quot;good&quot; choices through a lens of pure nutrition<br/>\nor a concept of &quot;what a good parent allows&quot;, but they are the best choices<br/>\nyour daughter can make now simply because those are the choices she&#39;s<br/>\nmaking.  (As Byron Katie says, &quot;When you argue with reality, you lose.  But<br/>\nonly 100% of the time.&quot;) She has her reasons.  Perhaps she&#39;s exploring<br/>\ntextures and flavors and that&#39;s more important to her now than anything<br/>\nelse.  Her body has stores of nutrients and is able to produce many others.<br/>\nHer body will give her a desire for other things eventually, if her desires<br/>\nare not overridden by an outside influence.  And I think that&#39;s the most<br/>\nchallenging thing for many families when stepping away from a controlling<br/>\napproach to food.  It&#39;s important to get really clean on your own thoughts<br/>\nabout your child&#39;s diet or you&#39;re likely to say and do things that are<br/>\nsubtly (or not so subtly) manipulating them into making choices that aren&#39;t<br/>\ncoming from their body&#39;s guidance.  That is the most common reason when a<br/>\nparent comes back a few months after lifting food restrictions saying &quot;I<br/>\ntried it, it didn&#39;t work- they&#39;ll eat nothing but candy&quot;.  It feels kind of<br/>\nrude to point out that the child is continuing to choose candy because the<br/>\nparent is standing over them nagging about &quot;nutrition&quot; every 30 seconds- but<br/>\nthat&#39;s what&#39;s making the child averse to anything remotely nutritious (or<br/>\nthe child will give in and eat a little of something the parent approves.but<br/>\ngenerally that still doesn&#39;t satisfy the parent).  If you can get really<br/>\nclear in your motivations for control, you can work through those beliefs to<br/>\nfind ones that are more freeing for yourself and your child.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLiving in wholeness so our children can live in theirs<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lesleyreidcross.wordpress.com\">http://www.lesleyreidcross.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Has anyone had this experience?","postDate":"1291314445","msgId":45351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlkOG9lZCtpaGsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkN3F1dStpYmthQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45350,"nextInTopic":45353,"prevInTime":45350,"nextInTime":45352,"topicId":45350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
