They have a<br/>\ngel cleanser and oil control lotion that are great. One of the other<br/>\ngreat things about MAC is their environmental and social awareness;<br/>\nthey encourage recycling by giving a free lipstick for every 6<br/>\ncontainers you bring back in. They also donate 100% of the money from<br/>\nall Viva Glam products to the MAC Aids Foundation which goes directly<br/>\nto patient care (meals, medicine, education for African kids<br/>\netc...average donations add up to $1 million per month) and they&#39;re<br/>\n100% cruelty free. Some companies say cruelty free but they buy<br/>\ningredients from companies that test on animals. MAC ONLY buys<br/>\nproducts from other cruelty free companies. Very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think Clarins and Origins make some great skincare. For<br/>\nbreakouts, nothing beats that Pro-active stuff! You can get it online<br/>\nor by calling them..sometimes they have Kiosks at the mall.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor natural, I prefer Avalon Organics mainly because it&#39;s one of the<br/>\nonly paraben free lines. Good prices too...get it at your local health<br/>\nfood store.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14854,"nextTopicId":14861}}
