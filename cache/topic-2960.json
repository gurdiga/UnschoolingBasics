We&#39;re working on deschooling ourselves which is a tough job.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just amazes me at how completely different the world seems the <br/>\nmore and more I read about unschooling.  Sometimes I start to feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m in the Twilight Zone.  So much that I&#39;ve been conditioned <br/>\nto believe is so was just wrong.  It&#39;s pretty scary sometimes to <br/>\nfeel like you&#39;re alone in your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking into this has also brought us to the idea of unjobbing as <br/>\nwell.  Now if I could only figure out how to make that work too.  <br/>\nThe consumer in me is having a hard time with that!! LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are going to conference this weekend!!!
