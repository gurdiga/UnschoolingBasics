Riley thinks it is yucky, rememer he is my most HS, smells terrible to him, he didn&#39;t even get past just poking at it. Ashley, 11, noticed how difficult it is to work with and how misleading the commercials were. Tessa, however, loves the stuff and she was the original one who wanted it. So, I will get her a few more select colors as well as explore the make your own floam site someone sent to the list. Right now we have just the hot pink, I found it at walmart, for less than $5.00. Tessa has wanted floam for a long time. She was not discouraged last night exploring it, just trying it on different surfaces. I made a few foil shapes, a heart and a T and we covered them and they look OK. We will glue pin backs onto them for T Valentine&#39;s. So, even though I wouldn&#39;t buy this stuff for anyone else, Tessa likes it, and that is what matters. I did mention I didn&#39;t think kids made the items we see on TV and the example pages, but Tessa corrected me and told me she knew kids did it, she saw them. The young believer she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 bucks on Floam. And thank you to however sent the make your site.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9189,"nextTopicId":9167}}
