I used some of the advice from this list about <br/>\nhugging our kids when they are driving us crazy.  I also asked him <br/>\nwhy he was so angry and tried to help him identify if he was bored, <br/>\nhungry, whatever.  Dh took him on bike rides, just the 2 of them.  <br/>\nWe helped him get a new PS game he had been wanting.  We spent extra <br/>\ntime with him.  And throughout I let him know that I loved him not <br/>\nmatter what.  Something has made a difference (although I&#39;m not sure <br/>\nif it was something in particular or all of the above together) <br/>\nbecause now he is a delight to be around.  He&#39;s been helping us <br/>\nunload the car, holding doors open for us when our arms are full, <br/>\nbeing patient with his younger bro, and giving us lots of hugs.  He <br/>\nseems so happy and confident.  Maybe it was just a phase, maybe he <br/>\nwas having a hard time transitioning to some changes in our schedule <br/>\nor maybe he just needed some extra love an attention???

He then chose to press a button on his Transformer (toy) that made a ringing noise and carefully watched me for a reaction.
