You could pick up some patterns there.  Thrift store clothes and sheets are a nice source of inexpensive fabric.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSewing is actually pretty easy, just time consuming -- but you could also use the patterns as a guide and glue the costumes together either with iron together seam tape or (probably) hot glue.  I&#39;ve never done that, but I dont&#39; see why it wouldn&#39;t work. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ethnic&quot; costumes, especially for clothes for ordinary people, are often variations on squares, making them especially easy to sew or put together. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe just get her some lenghts of silk in different shapes and colors and let her put together her own costumes with safety pins and by tying them on herself. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jessie <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, September 17, 2004 11:20 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Authentic costume resources?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would you believe this has nothing to do with upcoming Halloween?!
