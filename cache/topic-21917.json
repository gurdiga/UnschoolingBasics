Who knows what this mom might do or say if and when she returns?  Seems to me any mom who could do what she&#39;s already done, could also leave for a year or two or three -- and then come back and demand the child or make who-knows-what claim against the dad.  Or, alternatively, to come back in 3 days, take the child, and never come back so that he loses contact with his new-found daughter.
