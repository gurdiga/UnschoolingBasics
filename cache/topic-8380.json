Actually there are a few reasons.  We raise dairy goats so they must be fed and milked on a schedule, within an hour or so of the same time twice per day, otherwise their milk production drops way off and they can even dry up on you.  For animals to grow fastest (which is what you want for competitions), they really need to be fed about 12 hours apart, hence in the morning and in the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem comes in with my older daughter&#39;s competitive gymnastics....she has to be at the gym by 3:00 everyday....coupled with the fact that we live about an hour drive from anything we might want to do.  So even with getting up around 7:30am, we can&#39;t get everything fed (including us) and dressed until around 9:30 or 10.  With a 2 hour drive round trip and having to get back by 3:00, that gives us an entire 3 hours to go to the zoo, a movie, a picnic, whatever.  The three older kids show animals and we agreed ahead of time that we needed to make sure that there was still time each day for the younger kids to do fun things too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was all discussed ahead of time when the kids wanted to get the animals and do competitions.  We talked about the realities of time constraints, about it being a day in, day out kind of committment.  And the kids know that all they have to do say &quot;I&#39;m out&quot; and they are no longer committed.  We could literally have the goats sold within a week.  The animals take about 20 hours of work per week.  That is why we had long talks ahead of time because I knew that there was no way I could make that kind of time committment alone.  The kids had to either be in 100% or we couldn&#39;t do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are perfectly happy with the arrangement and when there have been times that interest has seemed to lag, we have talked about whether we want to continue doing this or not.  Usually, the lack of interest is very short lived and tied to a particular thing they might need to miss (validation (you don&#39;t get to pick the day and you must be there in order to go to any shows that year) on same weekend as spur of the moment sleep over so it comes down to picking between 2 things you enjoy).<br/>\n<br/>\nEven so, we try to be as flexible as possible.  Adriane went to a sleepover so I fed for her that morning.  Marsie had a chance to see a friend she hadn&#39;t seen in a while so I made sure the goats had water and the baby chickens were warm (her usual contribution).  They do the same for me if I ask them.  They do the same for each other.  Danny fed Marsie&#39;s rabbit this morning because she went to church with a friend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: averyschmidt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:patti.schmidt2@...\">patti.schmidt2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, December 18, 2005 3:53 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Sleep<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; By saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to get up to feed and clean stalls <br/>\n&gt; anymore, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d rather sleep.&quot; or by saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to get up to attend <br/>\n&gt; guitar lessons anymore, I&#39;d rather sleep.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This may be a really stupid question (I&#39;ve never raised <br/>\n&gt; livestock), <br/>\n&gt; but could the feeding and cleaning of stalls be moved to a later <br/>\n&gt; time <br/>\n&gt; in the same way guitar lessons could be moved to a later time?

That said, I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m trying to rush us <br/>\n&gt; into things (Tristan&#39;s only been out of school for a few weeks)?  <br/>\n&gt; I think a part of me is afraid he&#39;ll want to go back to school, <br/>\n&gt; despite all the problems he had, just to be with the kids.  Plus, <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t but think that maybe I&#39;m buckling under the pressure that <br/>\n&gt; my parents are putting on me to make sure Tristan is &quot;properly&quot; <br/>\n&gt; socialized since he is now homeschooled.  They seem to think he is <br/>\n&gt; going to become some antisocial deviant since he isn&#39;t bombarded <br/>\n&gt; by kids at school all day every day -- for better or <br/>\n&gt; worse...usually worse, in Tristan&#39;s case.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;Are activities the real reason you would like Tristan on a more <br/>\n&gt; traditional sleep pattern?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think so. IF there were activities that were extremely <br/>\n&gt; important to him (like your kids&#39; 4-H projects) I would hope that <br/>\n&gt; he would see that his sleep would need to be adjusted in order to <br/>\n&gt; keep up with his activities.  I let Tristan determine which <br/>\n&gt; activities he would like to pursue, as I would never force him <br/>\n&gt; into any activities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s so much that I would like him on a more <br/>\n&gt; traditional sleep pattern, rather than me seeing it as being so <br/>\n&gt; out of the norm for him and others his age. Not that we have to <br/>\n&gt; follow the crowd when it comes to &quot;proper&quot; bedtimes!  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As much as I love the whole concept and thought behind an <br/>\n&gt; unschooling lifestyle, parts of it are hard to apply when you have <br/>\n&gt; been raised differently all your life.  My parents were so <br/>\n&gt; controlling (and still try to be at times), and it&#39;s hard to break <br/>\n&gt; free from certain mindsets.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my <br/>\n&gt; parents will be coming for Christmas.  They are humoring me in <br/>\n&gt; regards to homeschooling (basically supporting my decision but <br/>\n&gt; want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into school ASAP) but would be <br/>\n&gt; totally and utterly against the idea of unschooling.

That said, I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m trying to rush us into things (Tristan&#39;s only been out of school for a few weeks)?  I think a part of me is afraid he&#39;ll want to go back to school, despite all the problems he had, just to be with the kids.  Plus, I can&#39;t but think that maybe I&#39;m buckling under the pressure that my parents are putting on me to make sure Tristan is &quot;properly&quot; socialized since he is now homeschooled.  They seem to think he is going to become some antisocial deviant since he isn&#39;t bombarded by kids at school all day every day -- for better or worse...usually worse, in Tristan&#39;s case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&quot;Are activities the real reason you would like Tristan on a more traditional sleep pattern?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think so. IF there were activities that were extremely important to him (like your kids&#39; 4-H projects) I would hope that he would see that his sleep would need to be adjusted in order to keep up with his activities.  I let Tristan determine which activities he would like to pursue, as I would never force him into any activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if it&#39;s so much that I would like him on a more traditional sleep pattern, rather than me seeing it as being so out of the norm for him and others his age. Not that we have to follow the crowd when it comes to &quot;proper&quot; bedtimes!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I love the whole concept and thought behind an unschooling lifestyle, parts of it are hard to apply when you have been raised differently all your life.  My parents were so controlling (and still try to be at times), and it&#39;s hard to break free from certain mindsets.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a little bit of worry is also creeping in because my parents will be coming for Christmas.  They are humoring me in regards to homeschooling (basically supporting my decision but want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into school ASAP) but would be totally and utterly against the idea of unschooling.

She  <br/>\nstarts picking fights with her brother when she gets tired. We take her in, get  <br/>\nher in bed, sing her Hush Little Baby (my kids HAVE to have this sung...) and <br/>\n tuck her in. She is allowed her books, a few toys and whatnot, and her light <br/>\non.  She&#39;s usually out within 15-30 mins.<br/>\nOur oldest (6), likes to play video games, unless I have shows on I like to  <br/>\nwatch. He always asks. If I do have something I want to watch, he&#39;ll play with <br/>\n his toys. Or watch. He sat on my lap and watched The Apprentice finale the <br/>\nother  night, and he gave me a &quot;manicure&quot; lol... On nights he plays video <br/>\ngames, he  plays until 9 or 10 and then will veg out in the chair and watch Food <br/>\nTV. He  loves watching Alton Brown&#39;s Good Eats. Or the competition shows. They <br/>\nhad a  cool holiday cake one the other night. He will usually say he&#39;s tired <br/>\naround 11  and ask to go to bed, which involves one of us tucking him in and <br/>\nsinging to him  too. Some nights, he&#39;ll go in early and read or play with a few <br/>\ntoys in  bed.<br/>\nThe baby (1), she sleeps when she sleeps. Usually she&#39;s down for the night  <br/>\nabout 10 or 11. Depends on when she napped during the day. It&#39;s almost 5 now <br/>\nand  she&#39;s stirring a bit from her nap. So, I&#39;m guessing she&#39;ll sleep around 11  <br/>\ntonight. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t usually go many places in the mornings.

Before <br/>\n&gt; I pulled Tristan from school, he had problems sleeping every <br/>\n&gt; night.  Once in bed (and we had to have a set bedtime to make sure <br/>\n&gt; he had adequate sleep for the next school day) he would claim that <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I know I won&#39;t be able to sleep&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll just feel awful in the <br/>\n&gt; morning&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m trying to sleep &#39;cause it just <br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t work!&quot;  I would be understanding, since I have dealt with my <br/>\n&gt; own sleep problems for a number of years.  We&#39;d talk in his <br/>\n&gt; darkened room, play quiet music that he liked, try to get him to <br/>\n&gt; relax and not focus on whether he could/could not sleep, etc.  He <br/>\n&gt; was so stressed out about school, that he would run the day&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; events in his head over and over again and was unable to fall <br/>\n&gt; asleep.  Or so I thought.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now that we are unschooling (well, deschooling right now), I <br/>\n&gt; thought that his sleep problem would disappear.  Not so.  I <br/>\n&gt; decided to lift the bedtime restriction, and he has been going to <br/>\n&gt; bed late - between 1:30 and 3:00AM and then sleeping until about <br/>\n&gt; 11AM.  I&#39;m a nightowl, but even this is pushing it for me so I&#39;ll <br/>\n&gt; head to bed and allow him to stay up as long as it is quiet (he <br/>\n&gt; can watch a movie downstairs, read, play quietly, etc.).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night Tristan asked to get on the computer, and I allowed <br/>\n&gt; that.  I found him still awake at 4AM this morning and going <br/>\n&gt; strong. I had him shut down the computer and go to bed  (probably <br/>\n&gt; a mistake).  I think the computer was a little TOO engaging.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just wondering....is this most likely just a phase?  A <br/>\n&gt; newfound freedom that he is exploring?  I can see it easily <br/>\n&gt; developing into a habit, however.  If someone doesn&#39;t wake up <br/>\n&gt; until one in the afternoon, they most likely will not be tired <br/>\n&gt; when midnight rolls around. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Although I want to lift any bedtime restrictions, I&#39;m unsure about <br/>\n&gt; him sleeping all day (well, into the afternoon) and then staying <br/>\n&gt; up the majority of the night.  My concern is that we do, at times, <br/>\n&gt; have commitments in the mornings.  He&#39;s 9 and not yet at an age <br/>\n&gt; where I can leave him home alone.  I was also hoping to get him <br/>\n&gt; involved with a local homeschooling group, but some of their <br/>\n&gt; activities are in the morning...not conducive to a child who is <br/>\n&gt; getting to bed in the wee hours of the morning.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now it&#39;s noon, and I haven&#39;t heard a peep for Tristan.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Malinda<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

My kids will stay up  <br/>\nlater and later - and, yes, sometimes I get up in the morning and  <br/>\nthey&#39;re still up - if they don&#39;t have a reason to get up early. But,  <br/>\nthese days, they also usually plan ahead and go to bed at least 8  <br/>\nhours before they know they need to get up. It has taken some trial  <br/>\nand error - sometimes getting too tired and being cranky the next  <br/>\nday, etc.  But it is VERY normal for teens to not feel sleepy at  <br/>\nnightl, just when younger and older people are starting wind down,  <br/>\nthey&#39;re revving up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be hard for parents not to see it as a moral failing of some  <br/>\nkind.
