Like the stress of school, for instance. They do this  <br/>\non their own without parents to help them. (Of course the parents are  <br/>\npart of the source of the stress since they&#39;re making kids go to  <br/>\nschool!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary goal should be removing the stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see a problem with choosing TV for comfort when it seems like  <br/>\nthe right thing to do. If a child came home disappointed from a  <br/>\ndisagreement with a friend, a snuggle under the covers with mom while  <br/>\nwatching a favorite movie could be just the ticket.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut your fears of TV might read into that as using TV as a panacea to  <br/>\nall problems. No, the goal is to look at the child and help the child  <br/>\nget what he wants and needs, not to look for a solution to paste onto  <br/>\nany problem that comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Let&#39;s say<br/>\n&gt; that instead of TV, the child seeks food for confort? This is how<br/>\n&gt; emotionally eating begins..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I think it&#39;s helpful to see an over all pattern rather than to  <br/>\nsee one instance as the beginning of the road to hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmotional eating doesn&#39;t come from a cup of hot chocolate drunk after  <br/>\na nightmare. It comes from not having help finding solutions to  <br/>\nstress and other problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know because I&#39;ve been battling food<br/>\n&gt; addiction my whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did your mom help you with problems in your life?

The goal is to get to the real  <br/>\nproblem and help kids find solutions that really work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s much easier to explain with real problems.
