He has some new 13 old homeschool<br/>\n&gt; friends who have introduced him to the conversations that boys this<br/>\n&gt; age start to have (which my son has also shared with me). I have an<br/>\n&gt; awesome and open relationship with my son. He&#39;d rather talk with me<br/>\n&gt; about sex than his Dad. AND, my husband and I have a new<br/>\n&gt; masterbedroom and an 11 roommate. Sometimes he starts out in his own<br/>\n&gt; bed but more often sleeps with us. When he&#39;s with us,all we do is<br/>\n&gt; sleep. He likes to be cuddled by both my husband and myself.

I am concerned and have not been able to help<br/>\n&gt; myself by initiating conversation about the appropriateness of his<br/>\n&gt; behavior while being careful not to shame or embarass him. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; asked him to take it to him room. Encouraged him to do what ever<br/>\n&gt; dance he needs to do infront of is mirror, take his clothes off and<br/>\n&gt; shake his booty in his room but to be considerate of his sister to no<br/>\n&gt; avail.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday they asked me about rape and then went off into a silly<br/>\n&gt; dialog that unnerved me then made me mad at them and then at myself,<br/>\n&gt; questioning my parenting.
