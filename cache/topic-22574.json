Like my Mom has said to me, not only are there going to be more homeschoolers everywhere, but you are gonna see it more and more in Montana.  And my friends view may be wrong or not.......I don&#39;t know.  I really don&#39;t know what the homeschooling community is like in that area, since I don&#39;t actually know any homeschoolers in Anaconda.  I&#39;d imagine places like Billings and Missoula would have larger homeschooling communities.  And Montana is a very friendly place, so building ones own little family of friends is rather easy to do.  I grew up where neighbors knew each other very well.  You don&#39;t find that in too many places anywhere, anymore.  I just wish it was not so darn cold there............BRRRRRRR!!!!!<br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron Parham &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:acsp2205@...\">acsp2205@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Kelly, I can&#39;t speak for Anaconda&#39;s receptivenss to unschooling, but at least Havre, Great falls, Billings, Chinook, and many small high-lone towns are &#39;full&#39; of us.
