There is no completely RIGHT thing in this world.  What maybe right for me is not usually right for my child.  It is a way we see the world.  I have one child that is very black and white aka right vs wrong.  To clean the kitchen table it must be wiped from one end to the other and no spot missed.  The other child sees the table needs to be cleaned and does so by wandering around and around the table till it is all done...sometimes center out, other times edge in (we have a circular table).  Is his way &quot;wrong&quot;?  Maybe in the eyes of the first child (and my mother)......but wasn&#39;t the outcome the same?  The table got cleaned.... So should I demean him by yelling and screaming that he isn&#39;t doing the table &quot;RIGHT&quot; like my mom would have or commend him for noticing the table needed to be cleaned and then using his own little way to do so making it sparkle and look great?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as humans who were treated in a demeaning manner we take things so personally because it hurts to think that we aren&#39;t thinking &quot;right&quot;.  When in reality, what was right for us was beaten out of us and now we are conformed drones looking for the answers that our hearts used to have.  I don&#39;t want to do that to my children which is why I am still here reading, pondering, questioning, changing, growing and understanding these wonderful unschoolers that have done it for soooo long.  I am sure at times I sound like a big baby that they just want to toss a foam brick through the internet at.....but, I know what they are really doing is showing us how it can be if we will respect our children the way we wanted desperately to be respected and loved when we were their ages.  It is tough to break those chains, but I know the more we hack away at them and redesign our perspectives the better relationships we will have with those who mean the most to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there--take a leap of faith from the cliff and let us push air at you to help you fly!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":317975928,"authorName":"mizelenius","from":"&quot;mizelenius&quot; &lt;mizelenius@...&gt;","profile":"mizelenius","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1255104456","msgId":41788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhbm40OCtmczlxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhbHNxcCtjZmNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41784,"nextInTopic":41791,"prevInTime":41787,"nextInTime":41789,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

For example, my husband and I do have  reservations about unschooling.  After all, it requires a leap of faith and trust.  However, just because we have doubts (which I am not suggesting be simply dismissed) it doesn&#39;t make unschooling the wrong choice for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is especially true with any transition-- each time I&#39;ve been pregnant, I&#39;ve wondered, &quot;How am I going to handle this new addition to the family?&quot;  But, once I&#39;ve actually had the child, obviously things work out.  We are new to unschooling in practice but not so new to it philosophically.  I don&#39;t know if I will continue to worry, but so far I&#39;ve found that it comes in waves .  . .I will trust in the process, but then something arises that makes me reconsider.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I feel like each time I&#39;ve thought about it, I am further ahead on the path (though I still have a long, long, long way to go).  When we first started after pulling DD out of public school (a year ago) it was because my then 6 y.o. specifically asked to be USd (she said, &quot;I learn best when I choose how and what I learn&quot;).  When I had doubts earlier, I&#39;d run out and purchase some new curriculum material (it was always math!).  We&#39;d try it for a few days or week and then I&#39;d stop because I saw damage being done.  Now when I have doubts, I take a deep breath and remember the big picture and leave it at that.  I think this will be easier as time goes on-- maybe the worries will crop up less often, and when they do, they will go away faster, so that eventually I won&#39;t notice much.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Elena</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1255091289","msgId":41784,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3NjEwODk0LTUxQ0QtNDQ2Ri05MTYyLUVEOUQzOUI1QzE5NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhbHNxcCtjZmNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhbHNxcCtjZmNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41783,"nextInTopic":41788,"prevInTime":41783,"nextInTime":41785,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What&#39;s closer to the truth is that  <br/>\nunschoolers push past their fears in order to unschool.

I don&#39;t have time to read them all and the reason I have not posted anything as of yet is that I have not had the time to search the archives and see what I would find there first.  My best friend is reading Raising Our Children Raising Ourselves and she was telling me about the exact part that you mentioned just earlier today.  She was talking about needing to apply it to herself because I tend to keep my cool when dealing with my children, but I like the fact that you brought it up.  I am in fact the opposite of what you are supposing.  I know that I have an obsessive personality and therefore don&#39;t trust my gut all the time.  Such as when I allowed my son to enter kindergarten even though everything inside me screamed &quot;no!&quot; and the fact that I went through experimenting with ADHD treatment instead of calling BS and getting him out sooner.  Especially since just two short months later he has no resentment and agrees that it was the best course.  But I like the fact that you wrote that.  The first response to my post seemed to imply that I actually had negative emotions toward my children where as before I discovered the world of unschooling I felt like I was fighting a single person war revolving around the respect I felt that my children deserved.  And I assure you it is quite the opposite of what you think.  I am thrilled that I have found people with children who are now adults or older teens who have solid ideas about what may or may not work and what resources are out there rather than having to go it all alone.  Everything in Joyce&#39;s response pointed at my attitude toward my children and what I SHOULD think and feel.  She said very little about anything else.  But I assure you, I welcome your words. <br/>\nThis part is also a response to Jill:<br/>\nMaybe the word &quot;worrying&quot; has a negative connotation around here.  Maybe a better word would be concern.  John Holt was concerned about public schools being the means to an end that it was not only failing to reach, but was out and out hindering.  He was concerned enough about it to devote a large portion of his life to the cause.  He then made the switch to helping parents realize that they could themselves be the means to that end and that the end did not necessarily have to be what society dictated.  He was concerned about our children having the chance to grow up to be happy, confident people and to enjoy childhood in the meantime.  And when I talk about worrying, I am talking about the worry of failing my children, not the worry of them disappointing me.  I think that may be another big misconception about my use of the word worry.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jill Parmer &lt;jparmer@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Oct 8, 2009, at 9:23 AM, AnnoraG wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;John Holt&#39;s life work was spawned by worrying about children  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; learning and how parents can facilitate that learning.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmmmm, I wonder where you got that about John Holt?

There&#39;s a style of discussion that exists on these lists that I haven&#39;t seen anywhere else - its not a debate style, nor is it a support group style. It can be quite a shock! I found, early in my journey onto discussion lists, to imagine I was stepping into a different culture. Of course things wouldn&#39;t make sense and seem backwards - or rude - at first, that&#39;s always the case when you discover a new culture. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I did not know I had stumbled upon a group of people containing a hierarchy that were there to teach me to &quot;think&quot; right. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been unschooling without other unschoolers around you, then you&#39;ve been feeling your way along as best you can. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that in the least, but its good to realize that there&#39;s a pretty extensive body of experience where unschooling is concerned. Unschoolers have been exchanging information and seeing what helps and what doesn&#39;t for over twenty years, now. That can be a little disappointing if you&#39;ve been feeling like a pioneer. All of a sudden, there are other people saying &quot;btdt, oh, and if you do it This way...&quot; - that&#39;s really what you&#39;ve run up against. Its not personal, its that you&#39;ve been reinventing the wheel and now you know you can download a schematic, as it were. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery child, every family is different. So unschooling is going to look different for every child, every family. That being said, twenty years of shared experiences tell us that there are things that help unschooling along, that help unschoolers live more closely aligned to our individual core values. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I expected &quot;experienced unschoolers&quot; to be able to give me suggestions of ways to go beyond the books in cases where I was at a loss due to my own ability to relate unfamiliar things to the real world.  Or help with giving all of my children the attention they need and deserve without compartmentalizing their days.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice you&#39;ve been on this list for a few months - in that time there has been a good bit of what you decribe above. I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t been reading very much onlist if you haven&#39;t run across that, yet, those are pretty frequent topics of discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If I have instead stumbled upon a group that is interested in treating unschooling as dogma and will be trying to shame me about my thoughts, and insisting that I simply have faith, let me know now so i can leave this group.  I am not looking for a preacher.  I would however, like to stay because of the issues that I did plan on bringing up to the group.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI honestly recommend you take a few weeks to read and make up your own mind on the matter. Read some older posts, too. Do a search on the list for topics of interest to you and see what comes up. Get a sense of how questions get answered around here so that when you throw in your 2c you&#39;re not surprised! Its a VERY different format for discussion than you&#39;ve probably ever encountered. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple tips for reading replies:<br/>\n*Assume the person replying has the best possible intentions. I can guarantee you that Joyce, and all the other long time list members have assumed that of you! <br/>\n*If a post &quot;sounds&quot; harsh to you, go back and read it with a different &quot;tone&quot; in mind - something kind and supportive, or bubbly and enthusiastic, if its someone who uses a lot of Caps and exclamations. Its really easy, given the content of this list, to assume a harsher tone than what&#39;s intended by the writer. Change the tone and see how you&#39;re understanding changes, too (I have to remind Myself to do this when I&#39;m pmsy, btw). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; We have to worry.  Discussing healthy ways to deal with that would make sense, but implying that we should not worry at all is ridiculous.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts natural to worry, but not inevitable. There are a lot of parenting worries that stem from misconceptions about development, for example, or misconceptions about what kids &quot;need&quot;. Other worries stem from personal issues - issues from the parent&#39;s past, I mean, and recognizing that can help to transform worry into active work on those issues. Some people worry out of a sense of powerlessness, but can let go of worries either by developing a greater sense of personal power or &quot;giving&quot; those worries to a higher power. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps unschooling to step away from worries. How to do that depends on specifics - what do You need to move away from those fears? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He really did not want to leave school, but is much happier now that he is out and off of the medications. Should I have not worried and let it continue? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing a problem and looking for solutions can happen in the absence of worry. Perhaps you&#39;re a naturally very emotional person and have a hard time seeing that distinction? Have you read Naomi Aldorts &quot;Raising our children, raising ourselves&quot;? Its a wonderful book about parenting, if you&#39;re interested. One of the things it talks about is stepping back from your own emotional reactions to things involving your child, because those emotional reactions can distort your perceptions. That&#39;s something that helps unschooling too, again, helps in the sense of helping You move closer to your own core values as a parent. When you move closer to your core values, you naturally connect more fully with your kids. Emotional reactions can get in the way of that, though - surprising as it may sound. That&#39;s because often the first thing one feels, as a reaction to something, is a sort of knee-jerk reaction, built out of habits and old baggage. So stepping back from that feeling, waiting to respond, rather than reacting to a stimulus, can help you be your Best self. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid that sound like preaching? There&#39;s a lot of that kind of talk on unschooling lists. Its not meant to be preachy, its meant to be something heartfelt. There&#39;s a lot of passion on this list - you sound pretty passionate yourself! And its easy to misread that, especially if you&#39;ve been going it alone for so long. Welcome to the company of very passionate people! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":392778979,"authorName":"Barbara","from":"&quot;Barbara&quot; &lt;barbaracolwell@...&gt;","profile":"barbaracolwell@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1255023739","msgId":41769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhbDg5citxdmI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhamlobyttczF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41767,"nextInTopic":41772,"prevInTime":41768,"nextInTime":41770,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you all for being so understanding and helpful.

I do not adopt foreign philosophies or try on new ones that sound a bit appealing.  I discovered a word for my attitude and thoughts and the fact that there were others that held these beliefs.

No where in the list description does it imply that this list exists to help people get over that.  My understanding of &quot;school think&quot; is the thought that children should learn things at a certain time in a certain way.  The advice that I expected to find on this list was help with dealing with children of varying ages and interests, in some cases interests that stray from my own knowledge.  I expected &quot;experienced unschoolers&quot; to be able to give me suggestions of ways to go beyond the books in cases where I was at a loss due to my own ability to relate unfamiliar things to the real world.  Or help with giving all of my children the attention they need and deserve without compartmentalizing their days.  I am not new to this philosophy, I am new to having three children totally dependent on me to facilitate their learning.  If I have instead stumbled upon a group that is interested in treating unschooling as dogma and will be trying to shame me about my thoughts, and insisting that I simply have faith, let me know now so i can leave this group.  I am not looking for a preacher.  I would however, like to stay because of the issues that I did plan on bringing up to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It helps when writing on a discussion list to think how the words  <br/>\n&gt; will be read by many different people.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some kids like workbooks. Some kids hate workbooks. Some kids think  <br/>\n&gt; workbooks make mom happy. Some kids think workbooks make you learn  <br/>\n&gt; what you&#39;re supposed to. Some moms *hear* that kids will learn math  <br/>\n&gt; through life experiences but tense up when their child plays video  <br/>\n&gt; games and sigh with relief when their child reaches for a workbook.  <br/>\n&gt; That child will know she&#39;s being judged and may want to do what&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;right&quot; to please mom even if she feels it&#39;s wrong for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it is not important to think about how those words might be read unless this is a group that tells people how to think and my words may induce fear in the ruling class that I am poisoning the masses with my wayward ideas.  I shouldn&#39;t need to justify the fact that my daughter hates video games and thinks of math workbooks as puzzle books.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yet lots of people reading trying to let go of the old ideas about  <br/>\n&gt; learning and adopt the new ideas will think exactly that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s natural to assume schools are using the best methods possible to  <br/>\n&gt; teach like phonics and sight reading. It&#39;s hard to let go of that  <br/>\n&gt; idea. It&#39;s hard to embrace different ideas that seem counter to what  <br/>\n&gt; someone knows is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it really natural to assume that?  You also said that this group is for people who are ready to let go of all that?  Which is it?  Is it a matter of you trying to indoctrinate people or is it a matter of you discussing your experience to help people who are on the same page and trying to maintain an unschooling household?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unsatisfying as it sounds, what unschoolers do isn&#39;t as helpful  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for new unschoolers as understanding how children learn. What  <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers do can, on the surface, look like school. Some unschooled  <br/>\n&gt; kids will do workbooks. (And a new to unschooling mom who is worried  <br/>\n&gt; will eagerly grasp at that!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give the readers a little more credit.  This is billed as a group that helps people who have already been introduced to the philosophy apply it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you could read through the eyes of a new unschooler, you would see  <br/>\n&gt; that your post read different from what you intended. No where did  <br/>\n&gt; you mention you were new to unschooling. No where did you mention you  <br/>\n&gt; were working on letting go of your worries. Your post was supportive  <br/>\n&gt; but supportive of worries at the edge of the cliff, not supportive of  <br/>\n&gt; jumping off and flying. We&#39;re here to help people fly, not feel  <br/>\n&gt; comfortable edging toward the cliff.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not new to unschooling, I am new to the word.  I am sure when the worries I have now dissipate they will be replaced with new worries and I really see no reason to defend that.  We have to worry.  Discussing healthy ways to deal with that would make sense, but implying that we should not worry at all is ridiculous.  My son chose to go to school, but ended up needing medication to sit in the class and do what they wanted him to do.  He really did not want to leave school, but is much happier now that he is out and off of the medications. Should I have not worried and let it continue?  And once again, this is billed as a group to discuss issues of parenting and daily life with experienced unschoolers, not a place to have our faith strengthened.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnora.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1255001587","msgId":41762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5QUY4QTQ0LTYzQjgtNDk2Qi1BMkM1LTBBNTUzNEYzRTQzQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhamlobyttczF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhamlobyttczF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41761,"nextInTopic":41767,"prevInTime":41761,"nextInTime":41763,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some moms *hear* that kids will learn math  <br/>\nthrough life experiences but tense up when their child plays video  <br/>\ngames and sigh with relief when their child reaches for a workbook.  <br/>\nThat child will know she&#39;s being judged and may want to do what&#39;s  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; to please mom even if she feels it&#39;s wrong for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Furthermore, they do not have the personalities that would allow  <br/>\n&gt; them to be satisfied with right answers and no concrete understanding.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one else has your children. Advice dependent on a family&#39;s  <br/>\npersonalities can be a disaster in someone else&#39;s family.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* went through school satisfied with right answers and no concrete  <br/>\nunderstanding. That is my personality. I enjoy absorbing facts.  <br/>\n(Probably why I did well in school!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will help people unschool is helping them understand why it  <br/>\nworks. It&#39;s why the principles are discussed more than specific  <br/>\nmaterials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And with an attentive parent by their sides, my children are not  <br/>\n&gt; very likely to move through if they can&#39;t understand something.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general terms, it&#39;s okay if kids move on with an imperfect  <br/>\nunderstanding. Humans naturally learn by building understanding bit  <br/>\nby bit. The process often involves  wrong understanding and growing a  <br/>\nbetter understanding from how something is not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding towers involves a lot of collapsed towers. Often we learn  <br/>\nmore from making mistakes than from doing things right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe naturally learn basically by the scientific method. We observe. We  <br/>\ncome up with a theory on why something is happening or how something  <br/>\nworks. We test that theory. We observe and analyze the results. If  <br/>\nthe theory didn&#39;t work as we expected, we refine the theory and repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We do all of the things besides books on tape. Why would you assume  <br/>\n&gt; that we don&#39;t?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I made no assumptions about you. My reply was to everyone reading.  <br/>\nSome of them I *know* are baffled -- I was 14 years ago! -- when  <br/>\ntrying to think of literature outside of the school model.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; In real life English doesn&#39;t stop with literature. It&#39;s connected to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything. Don&#39;t put it in a box. That&#39;s when it gets dull!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ummm...speech, okay. What else?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 7 year old has a comic book character named Cat Dak. I don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; think she would be doing &quot;better&quot; by recognizing sight words.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yet lots of people reading trying to let go of the old ideas about  <br/>\nlearning and adopt the new ideas will think exactly that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s natural to assume schools are using the best methods possible to  <br/>\nteach like phonics and sight reading. It&#39;s hard to let go of that  <br/>\nidea. It&#39;s hard to embrace different ideas that seem counter to what  <br/>\nsomeone knows is true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, your English sounds like the same old communication I  <br/>\n&gt; associate English with.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not sure what you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone asks specifically for literature ideas people here could  <br/>\ncome up with several dozen. But when it might take an hour or more to  <br/>\ncompose a thoughtful reply to a post asking lots and lots of general  <br/>\nunschooling, that&#39;s expecting a bit much from volunteers!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unsatisfying as it sounds, what unschoolers do isn&#39;t as helpful  <br/>\nfor new unschoolers as understanding how children learn. What  <br/>\nunschoolers do can, on the surface, look like school. Some unschooled  <br/>\nkids will do workbooks. (And a new to unschooling mom who is worried  <br/>\nwill eagerly grasp at that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe why beneath our choices is way more important for someone trying  <br/>\nto unschool their kids. My daughter writing a novel helps no one  <br/>\nunschool. (And I&#39;m sure several people whose child won&#39;t even write a  <br/>\nnote are more worried now!) The novel isn&#39;t important! What&#39;s  <br/>\nimportant is supporting their interests. I supported Kathryn&#39;s love  <br/>\nof various video games and TV shows, drawing, writing, dinosaurs,  <br/>\nSlugbugs, Pokemon, olives, pens, Beanies ... No one else could do  <br/>\nexactly that and have a child write a novel.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if someone supports and respects *their* child&#39;s interests, the  <br/>\nchild will happily pursue what they enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started, I wanted people to tell me what to do. I wanted  <br/>\nunschooling materials to plop into my schoolish understanding of how  <br/>\nkids learn. But what I needed was to let go of the idea that my doing  <br/>\nsomething specific would move my child from ignorance to a particular  <br/>\nunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal learning isn&#39;t that neat and clean.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I wrote applied to my entire family<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful to think about how ideas will work in families that are  <br/>\nvery different from yours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was talking about us being able to live our lives doing what is  <br/>\n&gt; important to us without the confines of schooling etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you could read through the eyes of a new unschooler, you would see  <br/>\nthat your post read different from what you intended. No where did  <br/>\nyou mention you were new to unschooling. No where did you mention you  <br/>\nwere working on letting go of your worries. Your post was supportive  <br/>\nbut supportive of worries at the edge of the cliff, not supportive of  <br/>\njumping off and flying. We&#39;re here to help people fly, not feel  <br/>\ncomfortable edging toward the cliff.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46477013,"authorName":"Ulrike Haupt","from":"&quot;Ulrike Haupt&quot; &lt;rica@...&gt;","profile":"ulrikehaupt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1254981858","msgId":41761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmEwMWNhNDdkZCQyZWNjZDIwMCQzYWZlYThjMEB1bHJpa2VhZjEyZmFmYT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhhamlobyttczF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41760,"nextInTopic":41762,"prevInTime":41760,"nextInTime":41762,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All In a couple of the posts on this subject reading at a certain age and learning to read was mentioned.

I see that she may have been right.  I wrote nothing to infer that I did not love and respect my children for who they are, nor did I write about what I &quot;wish they were.&quot;  I was writing about not wanting them to miss out.  I also thought that I had made it pretty clear that this is something I see myself getting over. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of my children not reading/reading levels: I KNOW my daughter shouldn&#39;t necessarily be reading and I am not pushing her to read.  One of my other comments you took a quip at mentioned that I have yet to take any action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And if he had perfect grammar and no novel, would that be better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What he&#39;s accomplished is hugely creative. Grammar is mechanics. In  <br/>\n&gt; fact they have copy writers who can put in punctuation. The copy  <br/>\n&gt; writers can create novels out of strings of grammatically correct but  <br/>\n&gt; dull sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was in no way implying that what my child is doing is not good enough for me.  I was making the point that his interests do lie in the same realm as mine, though he is not interested in &quot;studying&quot; the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Curriculum is good at getting kids to jump through hoops and perform  <br/>\n&gt; for tests. It can&#39;t guarantee understanding.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the number one all time best math &quot;curriculum&quot; is video  <br/>\n&gt; games! It involves far more and deeper mathematical thinking than is  <br/>\n&gt; found in 12 years of public school.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>FYI:  my daughter loves math workbooks.  And with an attentive parent by their sides, my children are not very likely to move through if they can&#39;t understand something.  Furthermore, they do not have the personalities that would allow them to be satisfied with right answers and no concrete understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Watch movies they love. Talk about them. Read books together. Listen  <br/>\n&gt; to books on tape. Take dictation of their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We do all of the things besides books on tape.  Why would you assume that we don&#39;t?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In real life English doesn&#39;t stop with literature. It&#39;s connected to  <br/>\n&gt; everything. Don&#39;t put it in a box. That&#39;s when it gets dull!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ummm...speech, okay.  What else?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But it&#39;s unlikely that it will look like anything they would do in  <br/>\n&gt; school. Much of my daughter&#39;s writing before 14 was comics and  <br/>\n&gt; catalogs of Slugbug products she made up. She still does comics but  <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s also moved onto novels. I didn&#39;t do anything that looked like  <br/>\n&gt; English but I did make word processing available to her any time she  <br/>\n&gt; wanted it, lots and lots of paper and writing tools. *That* was her  <br/>\n&gt; English.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My 7 year old has a comic book character named Cat Dak.  I don&#39;t think she would be doing &quot;better&quot; by recognizing sight words.  But, your English sounds like the same old communication I associate English with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Best not to have a bar you expect him to reach. It will strain your  <br/>\n&gt; relationship. It&#39;s not up to him to prove he&#39;s learning. It&#39;s up to  <br/>\n&gt; you to find ways to see the learning in what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What I wrote applied to my entire family and I was talking about us being able to live our lives doing what is important to us without the confines of schooling etc.  I do not appreciate the assumptions you have made about my feelings toward my children.  All of my anxieties have to do with my desire for them to be able to experience life as fully as possible. And I see those anxieties for what they are, my own personal hang-ups that I feel will fade with time spent watching my children living lives that they love.    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Oct 6, 2009, at 11:07 PM, AnnoraG wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have this desire to push language arts because I want my kids to  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; be able to engage in &quot;the great conversation.&quot; I want them to be  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; able to read and write!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My 7 year old does not read<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Most* 7 yos can&#39;t read.

Some can go through the motions of what&#39;s  <br/>\ndubbed reading in school. Some do learn early. But most are not doing  <br/>\nwhat an adult would call reading: being able to pick up some printed  <br/>\nmatter that the want to read and read for enjoyment or information.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; my 9 year old is on a ninth grade reading level<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which does not mean he reads as well as a ninth grader. What that  <br/>\nmeans is he could read the material given to him as well as a ninth  <br/>\ngrader. Not the same at all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and he has a novel that he works on from time to time, but he hates  <br/>\n&gt; grammar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if he had perfect grammar and no novel, would that be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he&#39;s accomplished is hugely creative. Grammar is mechanics. In  <br/>\nfact they have copy writers who can put in punctuation. The copy  <br/>\nwriters can create novels out of strings of grammatically correct but  <br/>\ndull sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I did order the Singapore math books<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Curriculum is good at getting kids to jump through hoops and perform  <br/>\nfor tests. It can&#39;t guarantee understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the number one all time best math &quot;curriculum&quot; is video  <br/>\ngames! It involves far more and deeper mathematical thinking than is  <br/>\nfound in 12 years of public school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am still deliberating about what to do in the English department<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Leave the English departments in the colleges for the professors! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch movies they love. Talk about them. Read books together. Listen  <br/>\nto books on tape. Take dictation of their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn real life English doesn&#39;t stop with literature. It&#39;s connected to  <br/>\neverything. Don&#39;t put it in a box. That&#39;s when it gets dull!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they will pursue them of their own accord.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s unlikely that it will look like anything they would do in  <br/>\nschool. Much of my daughter&#39;s writing before 14 was comics and  <br/>\ncatalogs of Slugbug products she made up. She still does comics but  <br/>\nshe&#39;s also moved onto novels. I didn&#39;t do anything that looked like  <br/>\nEnglish but I did make word processing available to her any time she  <br/>\nwanted it, lots and lots of paper and writing tools. *That* was her  <br/>\nEnglish.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope this sets the bar for our unschooling adventures, and I  <br/>\n&gt; believe that if it does, I will naturally ease up!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Best not to have a bar you expect him to reach. It will strain your  <br/>\nrelationship. It&#39;s not up to him to prove he&#39;s learning. It&#39;s up to  <br/>\nyou to find ways to see the learning in what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":309081207,"authorName":"Beth Williams","from":"Beth Williams &lt;beth.s.williams@...&gt;","profile":"mongoosewilliams","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1254919301","msgId":41743,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmN2YzYTczMDkxMDA3MDU0MWkyODc5ZmQyNnUyOGY4MzE5ZjA5MmI0MTU5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhZ2xkMStrbGQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhZ2xkMStrbGQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41741,"nextInTopic":41744,"prevInTime":41742,"nextInTime":41744,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen on this list for a bit but haven&#39;t posted (enjoying reading and taking<br/>\nit all in).  We&#39;ve always &quot;unschooled&quot;, but I&#39;ve never been sure if I was<br/>\ndoing it &quot;right&quot;.  I get confused and conflicted too.<br/>\nAnyway, I just wanted to say that it&#39;s been really challenging to let go of<br/>\nsome ideas society has about when the &quot;right&quot; time a child should learn A,B<br/>\nor C.  My kids have many friends in school and once my 8 year old had<br/>\nfriends that were pushed to read in school and spell, etc. they started to<br/>\ntell her things like &quot;why don&#39;t you go to school so you&#39;ll learn this?&quot;<br/>\n(when she asks them how to spell something).  But at the same time she does<br/>\nnot liked to be pushed.  When I&#39;ve gotten a bit worried and frustrated w/<br/>\nher not knowing how to read something and she&#39;d ask how to spell something<br/>\nor what something says, I would say things like, &quot;what do you think it<br/>\nstarts with?  let&#39;s sound it out...&quot;  She just never got phonics.  And<br/>\nsometimes would let me tell her about it but generally would grump, &quot;JUST<br/>\nTELL ME!&quot;.  (my cue to shut up and stop pushing something she did not want<br/>\nto do and was not helpful to her!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt became plain to me about a year ago that she is a visual reader when we<br/>\nwere in a public bathroom and she read on the TP holder &quot;turn clockwise to<br/>\nrefill&quot;.  I was like --WHAT?!  how does she know that&#39;s what that says?  So<br/>\nI asked and she said she knew the word clock and figured out the rest.<br/>\n Recently she read the word &quot;requirements&quot; in a book -yet, has trouble w/<br/>\nwords like &quot;where&quot; and &quot;there&quot;.  &quot;then&quot; and &quot;when&quot;, &quot;has&quot; and &quot;was&quot;.  These<br/>\nare more common words and look alike.  The HUGE unusual words are easy for<br/>\nher!<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked on a local yahoogroup I&#39;m on about that.  An unschooling friend w/<br/>\nteens said these kids (visual learners) learn early that phonics has too<br/>\nmany exceptions to the rules and they can&#39;t be bothered.  Mostly we read<br/>\nthat way anyway (most of the words we know are from repetition and are in<br/>\nour memory bank...we sight read them), and in school they have lists of<br/>\n&quot;sight words&quot; they give the kids (that don&#39;t fit in the &quot;rules&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 y.o. was trying to teach my 5 y.o. to &quot;sound out&quot; the word &quot;dog&quot; in the<br/>\ncar the other day and I realized how many sounds the letter &quot;o&quot; can have!?<br/>\n Not only long as in &quot;mow&quot; and short as in &quot;apple&quot; but what the heck is<br/>\n&quot;dog&quot;?  it&#39;s like an &quot;aw&quot; or &quot;au&quot; sound!  How confusing!  Do we really need<br/>\nto juggle all those rules, that are often broken anyway, in our little minds<br/>\nas kids?  She&#39;s learning SLOWLY how to read.  It&#39;s been a LONG process.  But<br/>\nthis summer she got so excited about it and has taken off with it.  Asks for<br/>\nbooks that interest her, reads them in the car and when she can&#39;t figure out<br/>\na word, she spells it to me and I tell her what it is. She has an interest<br/>\nand desire, so she&#39;s making it happen.  It&#39;s exciting to see the process!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso...they&#39;ve been into Madlibs for awhile.  Who doesn&#39;t love that<br/>\nsilliness (and chance to use &quot;poop&quot; in a story over and over!?) ---those<br/>\nthings are basically a grammar lesson.  BTW, my 5 y.o. and I did one in a<br/>\nkids Nat. Geographic mag my dad sent to them and one of the blanks was for<br/>\n&quot;body part&quot;....she said, &quot;esophagus&quot;.  Where she got that, I have no<br/>\nidea....but I bet if I asked, the answer would be --from some TV show.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re always asking me what words mean too.  When I&#39;m at a loss for a good<br/>\ndefinition (or want to make sure I&#39;ve given an accurate definition) I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen going to an online dictionary to read them what it says...from that<br/>\nthey&#39;re learning that dictionaries are out there if they need help with a<br/>\nword.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I&#39;d throw some ideas out about how we manage w/o a curriculum<br/>\nand how kids learn when they&#39;re ready and because it&#39;s something that<br/>\ninterests them.  Pushing is not necessary, what we need we learn along the<br/>\nway, but I know letting go of the &quot;what if-ing&quot; can be difficult.  I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s a process too (for the parents) and like learning to read, can&#39;t be<br/>\nexpected to happen overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\nBeth Williams<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1254914182","msgId":41741,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1MDczRDkzLTM1OEItNERFQi04Mzk3LTFCNTAxRDVGOUIyQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhZ284ZisyajliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhhZ284ZisyajliQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41739,"nextInTopic":41743,"prevInTime":41740,"nextInTime":41742,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooling seems to be a way of avoiding being mean to  <br/>\nthe kids but will ultimately leave them unlearned.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the truth is that what kids learn in school is *made* hard to  <br/>\nlearn. Not because educators are mean ;-) but because they need to  <br/>\ndemonstrate that specific learning is taking place. In order to prove  <br/>\nlearning, they are limited in the methods that yield something  <br/>\ntestable. Unfortunately the natural way we -- and all animals --  <br/>\nlearn is scatter shot. We pick up bits and pieces here and there as  <br/>\nwe need them. We naturally learn to grow our understanding. It&#39;s very  <br/>\nvery hard to test for understanding (especially since we don&#39;t  <br/>\napproach understanding linearly). (And very very hard to grade!)  <br/>\nThat&#39;s why most tests test for what&#39;s been memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is sort of like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. We naturally  <br/>\nwork on the areas that interest us that expand and grow to meet up  <br/>\nwith other areas of interest. And we jump around. At first the puzzle  <br/>\noften just looks like bigger pieces of chaos. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, the kids are told what they&#39;re going to make and told to  <br/>\nfind the corner piece and place it in the corner. Then the next piece  <br/>\nthat attaches to it. Then the next piece that attaches to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the two puzzles were tested against school standards: how many of  <br/>\nthe upper left is done, the schooled puzzle worker might have a  <br/>\nseveral dozen pieces in the corner. The natural puzzle worker might  <br/>\nhave two. But what would be missed by a standardized test is all the  <br/>\n*other* pieces the natural puzzle worker had assembled. And, while  <br/>\nthe schooled puzzle assembler might test well, they aren&#39;t learning  <br/>\nways to tackle a jigsaw puzzle. They *look* like they&#39;re  <br/>\naccomplishing something, but what they&#39;re learning is that doing  <br/>\npuzzles is hard and boring and pointless and left on their own it&#39;s  <br/>\nunlikely they&#39;ll finish it. The natural puzzle worker doesn&#39;t look  <br/>\nlike they&#39;re accomplishing anything (judging by their progress in the  <br/>\ncorner since that&#39;s *all* a standardized test can test) but they&#39;re  <br/>\nhaving fun and the real accomplishment is happening far from the  <br/>\ntesting area. And if they enjoy it, they&#39;re likely to do many puzzles  <br/>\nin their life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is to natural learning as Spanish class is to picking up  <br/>\nlanguage as a child. One is hard and pretty much ineffective after  <br/>\nclass is done. The other is effortless and effective. The second is  <br/>\nso effortless that we don&#39;t even take it seriously. We just know it&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething mysterious that happens and has no relationship to anything  <br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it does! That&#39;s how we are designed to learn! It&#39;s messy. Chaotic  <br/>\nnatural learning is very frustrating for someone who wants feedback  <br/>\nthat specific learning is taking place. If there had been a  <br/>\nstandardized test of language acquisition in 18 month olds, a typical  <br/>\nquestion would be pronouncing their name. My daughter would have  <br/>\nfailed. A standardized test would *not*  have asked how many dinosaur  <br/>\nnames she knew ;-) (She had a shirt with 9 dinosaurs on it which she  <br/>\ncould rattle off. She could say pachycephalosaurus before she could  <br/>\nsay Kathryn ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting that unless you&#39;re a history buff, that you&#39;ve forgotten  <br/>\nway more history than you remember! The political doings of dead  <br/>\nwhite guys is really dull for most people. What most people find  <br/>\ninteresting is bits of history of whatever interests them, social  <br/>\nhistory, how people lived in the past (movies and books are good for  <br/>\nthat). As the build up that jigsaw puzzle, it eventually connects to  <br/>\nbits and pieces of political history.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter probably knows more about early 1900s America than I do  <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s been fascinated by early baseball and has read several  <br/>\nbooks about it. One of her favorite guitarists was dressed as a  <br/>\ngangster in a video and that sparked an interest in gangsters. We&#39;re  <br/>\nreading a book about gangsters in film and it&#39;s starting way back  <br/>\nwith the beginning of real gangsters and prohibition and the politics  <br/>\nsurrounding it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that the same as slogging through a history course? Absolutely  <br/>\nnot. In some ways it&#39;s inferior since it doesn&#39;t cover the  <br/>\n&quot;important&quot; stuff. But how much of the &quot;important&quot; stuff do most  <br/>\npeople remember? In many ways it&#39;s superior. My daughter really knows  <br/>\nthe information she&#39;s read about early baseball. She hasn&#39;t just  <br/>\nmemorized it. She knows the whys and wherefores. She knows some of  <br/>\nthe social and political history that influenced what happened.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a foundation she&#39;ll build on throughout life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is educators get to say &quot;We did our job. We put the  <br/>\ninformation in there. Not our fault if they don&#39;t remember it 10  <br/>\nyears later.&quot; But *shouldn&#39;t* part of their job to be to make those  <br/>\n12 years time well spent? The &quot;Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader&quot;  <br/>\nis pretty telling. But it doesn&#39;t tell what it supposedly does: that  <br/>\n5th graders are smarter than adults. It says that great huge chunks  <br/>\nof that stuff you put up with learning for 12 years is going to be  <br/>\ngone by the time you&#39;re an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet how many adults can still recite the theme song to Gilligan&#39;s  <br/>\nIsland? ;-) Some think it means we&#39;re naturally drawn to trivial  <br/>\nentertainment and must be made to learn the hard stuff. No, what it  <br/>\nreally means is that if it&#39;s fun and *personally meaningful* we&#39;ll  <br/>\nremember.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I mean, how will the kids learn math? You know, adding,  <br/>\n&gt; subtracting, multiplication?? What about language? How will they  <br/>\n&gt; know what to capitalize or the correct punctuation?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know, it&#39;s hard to imagine. But they do. We are natural puzzle  <br/>\nsolvers. We want to understand how things work. We want to master  <br/>\nwhat we enjoy. We don&#39;t necessarily want to know how things work on  <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s schedule, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because an unschooled kid might not be using standard  <br/>\npunctuation and capitalization when schooled kids are doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t care. It means it&#39;s not important to them. Yet. Mostly  <br/>\nkids are writing for themselves. *At that age* they don&#39;t need to  <br/>\ncommunicate to someone else so all that&#39;s important to them is  <br/>\ngetting the thoughts down onto paper or screen. (It might be a story.  <br/>\nIt might be a label.) Translating thoughts to words is important part  <br/>\nof writing. (And the part that&#39;s hard to test! Testing grammar and  <br/>\npunctuation is easy and why its made more important in school than it  <br/>\nreally is.) Later, when they&#39;re communicating with others (and trying  <br/>\nto read others&#39; communications) on message boards and email and so  <br/>\non, they&#39;ll feel the difference between standard grammar and  <br/>\ncreative. Reading a novel in chat speak might be interesting once but  <br/>\nit would be pretty obvious how limiting it is for meatier  <br/>\ncommunication! ;-) (But writing out thoughts formally on a text  <br/>\nscreen is equally limiting! Each has their uses.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really really really hard to imagine how kids can learn math  <br/>\nmerely by using it. As an engineer I was certain you couldn&#39;t learn  <br/>\nmath without hours and hours of practice. I was wrong. I didn&#39;t learn  <br/>\nmath so much as practice applying formulas. I didn&#39;t really  <br/>\nunderstand what lay beneath the formulas because it was obscured by  <br/>\nthe tedium of getting the precise answer to the 3rd decimal point. My  <br/>\ndaughter, though, understands *how* numbers work. She understands  <br/>\ntheir fluid nature and how they&#39;re manipulated.

My 7 year old does not read, my 9 year old is on a ninth grade reading level (I know this because he was in public school until the beginning of this year)and he has a novel that he works on from time to time, but he hates grammar.

My friend&#39;s response was that because of my children&#39;s personalities and the environment they live in, she can&#39;t imagine them not coming into these things on their own.  I did order the Singapore math books and I am still deliberating about what to do in the English department, but I honestly think in the end as I allow my children to disassociate these things with &quot;school work&quot; they will pursue them of their own accord.  I would also like to ease your concerns about college.  I am a high school drop out.  I was able to get into an honors college based on my ACT scores, a paper I wrote and an interview.  I did this with a tenth grade education. When we wrote our first papers during my first semester, I would not allow any of my peers to read my paper.  I was embarrassed because I had never been taught to write.  They all assured me that no one learns to write a paper until they go to college.  And believe it or not, I scored much higher on that paper than most of my class mates.  When I switched to a regular university, I was required to take a remedial math class that I did not receive credit for before I went on to take my other maths, but while I was attending the honors college, there was no need because we took what was called pure math. I am feeling a little bit of that guilt that you&#39;re talking about too, but at least once a week something reminds me of how lucky we are that I made the decisions I did.  My nine year old who at this time last year was on ADHD medication so that he could sit still and be quiet is about to leave his Louisiana home to go to New Mexico to do volunteer work.  I hope this sets the bar for our unschooling adventures, and I believe that if it does, I will naturally ease up!  Good luck.  And always remember that you and your kids are living life and learning TOGETHER!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Barbara&quot; &lt;barbaracolwell@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello everyone...I am having some confusing/conflicting thoughts about myself as a homeschooler of my 2 sons..ages 8 and 5.

I&#39;m going to answer from my own experience, but first let me throw out some links with lots of basic information for you, in case you haven&#39;t found them yet:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://www.sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, now to answer a few of your question...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;barbaracolwell@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t see how anyone could completely unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With great pleasure. Really, its a wonderful, magical way to live. Its much less stressful than homeschooling. You get to like your kids more and vice versa. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I mean, how will the kids learn math? You know, adding, subtracting, multiplication?? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My 16yo has better math skills now than ever before because all the math he &quot;does&quot; is math he&#39;s using in his work and projects. Its not all mindless gibbrish to him anymore, its a valuable tool, one he wants to master. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, uses fractions and percentages and geometry. What she does often doesn&#39;t look like text book math, and I&#39;d be at an utter loss to tell you her &quot;grade level&quot; but she has all those basic concepts in her head. How? Numbers, quantities, patterns, shapes and relationships surround us. We live in a sea of mathematics all day long and don&#39;t usually realize it bc we&#39;ve been taught to think math comes from a book. It doesn&#39;t. People invent math the way they invent language. Its a way of describing the world and communicating about it. Untaught, kids learn math soooooo much more easily its astonishing. Its something our brains do very very naturally, like learning language. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What about language? How will they know what to capitalize or the correct punctuation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By reading and writing. My 8yo still uses a lot of invented spelling, and some invented punctuation, but she knows its invented, and is working on learning the standard ways of doing those things. She&#39;s interested in them. To a child who has never been taught grammer and punctuation, those are fascinating! Sometimes, writing one of her stories she&#39;ll stop and ask &quot;how do you spell this?&quot; or ask &quot;how do you show shouting?&quot; She already knows how to use quotation marks, since she writes a lot of dialog.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m teaching my 5 yr old to read by doing a phonics book..how would he learn on his own?? How would he know his vowels and the different sounds?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo, who reads as well as she understands speech, doesn&#39;t know what a vowel is yet. She&#39;s starting to figure them out through her writing, wrapping her mind around the concept. She doesn&#39;t like to be &quot;told&quot; things and forgets quickly when I tell her things she&#39;s not interested in, but one day I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have a conversation about vowels and she&#39;ll remember it. But she didn&#39;t need that information to learn to read, and doesn&#39;t need it to learn to write and spell. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany people struggle with phonics. My 16yo found them impossible. By the time he&#39;d sounded out a word he&#39;d forgotten the word. He could sound out an entire sentence without knowing what it said. Once he could read he found phonics useful for decoding, but he had to have enough words stored in his memory before the phonetic information was useful to him. One of my friends has a dd who could read whole sentences without being able to recognize all the words in them, or name all the letters - she needed &quot;chunks&quot; of meaning as it were. &quot;Put&quot; had no meaning. &quot;Put the cup on the table&quot; had meaning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I can kinda see unschooling science because you can learn so much of it from different places (farms, science centers, movies, etc) But what about history<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you know about the history of rock-n-roll? The history or heavy metal? Did you know those histories start on different continents? Its true. Why should you care? I dunno. My 16you finds that interesting bc he&#39;s learning to play bass and drums. Hidden in those histories are imperialism and slavery, the movement of goods and services and ideas across the face of the globe, war and pacifism, the differences between patriotism and nationalism, globalization and the celebration of ethnic heritages. Did you know all those things were wrapped up in a couple musical instruments? Its true. That&#39;s how unschoolers learn about history. It projects itself into the present, everywhere we look. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also really don&#39;t limit my children&#39;s time on the tv or internet, but I do require them to help out sometimes around the house, and clean up their rooms. Is that wrong?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts standard parenting wisdom that kids should be made to help out to teach them about responsibility. Unschoolers find that our kids become responsible without being taught, without being made to help out. My 8yo doesn&#39;t do much housekeeping, but will sometimes help if I ask (and sometimes say no). She&#39;ll sometimes volunteer to help. My 16yo cooks and cleans regularly. Before we unschooled it was excruciating to get him to &quot;help&quot; but after a couple years of deschooling he Wanted to. Why? Because he likes us and wants to help out. There are fringe benefits to this idea that you and your kids can like each other more - people who like each other do nice things for each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nYounger kids tend to find cleaning overwhelming. Its beyond their scope. They don&#39;t necessarily get better by being made to do it over and over bc a lot of what&#39;s going on is developmental. That&#39;s true of a lot of things with kids. As they grow, they become more able to handle complexity Without being taught. Standard parenting wisdom won&#39;t tell you that, it will say &quot;kids Need to learn xyz&quot; - but many many many times xyz is developmental. Kids Will learn it, just not when its convenient to parents. Its not the job of kids to be convenient to parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m looking for some real advice here..because I love my boys with all my heart and want wants best for them.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you do! Imagine if you could have what&#39;s best for them with less fighting, less pushing, less &quot;nos&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot; and with more smiles and friendliness. That&#39;s radical unschooling. You don&#39;t Have to keep fighting and pushing and making them, you can be their friend and ally, their consultant and facilitator. I won&#39;t say there are no issues and bad days, because we&#39;re all human! But you get to have an even better relationship with your kids - and they really do learn what they need to know in the process. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":392778979,"authorName":"Barbara","from":"&quot;Barbara&quot; &lt;barbaracolwell@...&gt;","profile":"barbaracolwell@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Unschooling and/or homeschooling","postDate":"1254873313","msgId":41738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhZ2xkMStrbGQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":41739,"prevInTime":41737,"nextInTime":41739,"topicId":41738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone...I am having some confusing/conflicting thoughts about myself as a homeschooler of my 2 sons..ages 8 and 5.
