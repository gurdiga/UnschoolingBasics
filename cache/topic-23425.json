I will tell<br/>\nher when there is supposed to be thunder/lightning, if<br/>\nneeded, so she is warned ahead of time.  I have done<br/>\neverything I can think of.  She even calls my parents<br/>\nin Iowa, and talks to them about a half dozen times a<br/>\nday.  They are also very good with her, and very<br/>\npatient.
