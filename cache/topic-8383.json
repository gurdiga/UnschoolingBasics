He","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1751670358\">I also have a guy that fights sleeping.  At 4, he needed a routine of calming things to help his body ease into relaxation rather than fight against it.  He would have a bath, then a foot massage, then be carried to bed and read a story.  Same thing every night.  We simply started when he seemed tired but not yet cranky.  Very similar to what you were doing with your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow at 7, he actually stays up quite a bit later but will often say &quot;I&#39;m tired, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;  There are still times when we go back to the old routine of bath and foot massage.  He seems to find it comforting, like an old teddy bear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that perhaps your son is a bit young to be making those decisions independently.  I personally, would go back to watching for his signals, calming him and calming the house, like talking to your older son about having a half hour or so with low lights and only soft music to help his little brother move into sleep (so Mars doesn&#39;t feel he is missing out on a good video fight).<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: denise &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:de_perri@...\">de_perri@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, December 15, 2005 2:44 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Help with figuring out bedtimes<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This is what we used to do in regards to our 4 year old and bedtime:<br/>\n&gt; 1) watch for sleepy signs<br/>\n&gt; 2)then bring him up to his room (this would usually turn out to be <br/>\n&gt; around the<br/>\n&gt; same time<br/>\n&gt; every night-between 7;10 and 7:30 p.m.)<br/>\n&gt; 3)read books, listen to tapes, sing songs, talk-his choice-until <br/>\n&gt; he fell asleep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Normally he would fall asleep within 2 to 20 mins.<br/>\n&gt; Not bad, probably.

(about 8 months, i think).<br/>\n&gt; We don&#39;t feel comfortable with Mars being downstairs either alone <br/>\n&gt; or with his<br/>\n&gt; brother for<br/>\n&gt; what could be long periods of time without us.<br/>\n&gt; They get along really well but Sett is not ready (his <br/>\n&gt; determination which was<br/>\n&gt; also our<br/>\n&gt; guess)to be alone with Mars on that level.<br/>\n&gt; What we came up with was that Mars can stay downstairs as long as <br/>\n&gt; one of us (me<br/>\n&gt; or my<br/>\n&gt; husband) are also down there.<br/>\n&gt; After that, he has the choice of either coming up to our room with <br/>\n&gt; us where he<br/>\n&gt; can watch<br/>\n&gt; t.v. or read or draw or whatever he wants that is on the quieter <br/>\n&gt; side of things<br/>\n&gt; till he falls<br/>\n&gt; asleep<br/>\n&gt; or<br/>\n&gt; he can go to his room with one of us and do the same kinds of <br/>\n&gt; things till he<br/>\n&gt; falls asleep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He can also tell us when he&#39;s sleepy and or fall asleep down with <br/>\n&gt; us and then<br/>\n&gt; we&#39;d take<br/>\n&gt; him up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first night Mars fell asleep watching t.v (12:30 a.m.). and my <br/>\n&gt; husband,Adam, took<br/>\n&gt; him up sometime after.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The second night Mars said he was sleepy and ready to go up when <br/>\n&gt; Sett said he<br/>\n&gt; was ready<br/>\n&gt; to go up(1:30 a.m.), but ended up fighting sleep once he was up <br/>\n&gt; there and saying<br/>\n&gt; he<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t ready so my husband brought him back down and he fell <br/>\n&gt; asleep playing mega<br/>\n&gt; man.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night my husband was ready to go up. (Adam and I had talked <br/>\n&gt; about being<br/>\n&gt; aware of<br/>\n&gt; when it was about 20-30 mins before we were absolutely ready to go <br/>\n&gt; to bed so<br/>\n&gt; that we<br/>\n&gt; could help Mars transition from being downstairs to being upstairs.)<br/>\n&gt; At 12:30 a.m. he started giving Marley time to adjust saying <br/>\n&gt; things like &quot;Mars,<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re going<br/>\n&gt; up in 30 mins, in 20 mins, in 10, in 5, in 3...&quot;. (This is what <br/>\n&gt; has worked best,<br/>\n&gt; transitions-<br/>\n&gt; wise, for my guys in the past, giving time *warnings* so they know <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s coming.)<br/>\n&gt; Adam had been asking Marley what and where he would like to do/go-<br/>\n&gt; our room, his<br/>\n&gt; room, books, gameboy, etc., but Mars was not interested in deciding.<br/>\n&gt; So when the time came to go up, Mars freaked out and started <br/>\n&gt; screaming and<br/>\n&gt; yelling and<br/>\n&gt; kicking and refused to go up.<br/>\n&gt; I had been asleep but woke up when I heard him and came down. I <br/>\n&gt; sat with him on<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; couch and held him and listened to him and he told me how he was <br/>\n&gt; feeling and I<br/>\n&gt; listened<br/>\n&gt; and gave him hugs and kisses. After he was in a calmner space, i <br/>\n&gt; started talking<br/>\n&gt; wiht him<br/>\n&gt; about what his options were-of either our room or his and which <br/>\n&gt; did he want but<br/>\n&gt; he got<br/>\n&gt; really upset again. Eventually I told him I was bringing him up to <br/>\n&gt; his room. He<br/>\n&gt; was still<br/>\n&gt; screaming and was pretty upset and I laid him in his bed and laid <br/>\n&gt; with him<br/>\n&gt; untill he fell<br/>\n&gt; asleep about 5 minutes later. Even as he was falling asleep he was <br/>\n&gt; saying &quot;mom,<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m so<br/>\n&gt; annoyed with you&quot; . (All of this, from when i came down to when he <br/>\n&gt; fell asleep,<br/>\n&gt; took about<br/>\n&gt; 20 mins.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What do i do now??? What did I do wrong??? We are working on <br/>\n&gt; putting a t.v. in<br/>\n&gt; the boy&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; room as soon as we can,<br/>\n&gt; but other than that I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n&gt; Am I starting this (letting him tell us) too early?<br/>\n&gt; Is it that I&#39;ve started this too late?<br/>\n&gt; Help.
