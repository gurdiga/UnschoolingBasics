I just joined minutes ago and wanted to send my intro<br/>\nbefore my day gets too hectic.  :o)  I&#39;m Valerie, 28, married to Jason,<br/>\n29.  We have 2 children, Shawn-9 and Haley-5.  I&#39;ve been &#39;book<br/>\nhomeschooling&#39; my son since he was 4, so we&#39;re in our 5th year.   Yes, I<br/>\ndo believe I&#39;ve been homeschooling since birth with both kids.  I am<br/>\nhere to get more info about unschooling.  That&#39;s what the group is all<br/>\nabout, right?   We live in Fayetteville, NC.  Jason is stationed at Ft.<br/>\nBragg, he&#39;s active duty Army.  :o)  I enjoy reading, baking, shopping,<br/>\nsewing and chatting online and in person with friends--over coffee of<br/>\ncourse!  I recently got a weekend job at JoAnn --this could mean trouble<br/>\nfor me since I *love* fabric and sewing.  I just needed some time to<br/>\nmyself, I haven&#39;t worked in 5 yrs, and also wanted to make some extra<br/>\nmoney on the side.  We bought our first home last year and are<br/>\ndiscovering just how much money that costs to keep up with!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, enough about me.  I want to hear more about Unschooling.  I know<br/>\na little but would love to hear how you all got into unschooling vs.<br/>\ntypical book-schooling method.  We ourselves use the internet, library,<br/>\nread lots of books on history and science, Shawn reads fun books by<br/>\nhimself and reads to me also, we do math worksheets and language arts<br/>\nworksheets as well.  We &quot;wing it&quot; when it comes to spelling, history,<br/>\nscience, etc.  Haley is still in play mode, she likes to write her abc&#39;s<br/>\nand some words, but mostly loves for me to read to her and play ponies<br/>\nwith her.  :o)  I love this age!<br/>\n <br/>\nChat later!<br/>\n <br/>\nValerie K<br/>\n...wife to Jason, homeschooling mom to Shawn and Haley...<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18355,"nextTopicId":18604}}
