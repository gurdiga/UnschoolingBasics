We had this thread going a while  back, <br/>\nbut I&#39;ve been thinking about it some more.  Things I&#39;m interested in  and taught <br/>\nmyself that school, college, and grad school was useless for:<br/>\ngardening (veggies and flowers)<br/>\nliving off-grid<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\nscrapbooking/ photography<br/>\ncutting fire wood<br/>\nconverting/ driving a veggie fuel powered car (dh does this, not me)<br/>\nplaying the piano<br/>\nfinding cool stuff at the library for us to learn from<br/>\nusing the computer & internet<br/>\nchild rearing<br/>\nworking with preschoolers/ high school students (my income, but didn&#39;t  <br/>\nactually learn anything useful during school for this)<br/>\nraising chickens<br/>\nbuilding a chicken coop, fence, and raised bed gardens<br/>\nbuilding with Legos<br/>\nplaying cool board games with the kids<br/>\n    I&#39;m sure there must be more, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come  up with for now.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I just found out that our area is planning a children&#39;s museum to  open <br/>\nin a year, I have got to get in on this,maybe I would jump off the public  <br/>\nschool educator&#39;s boat to join in- and maybe, just maybe, my own children would  <br/>\nbe welcome there during working hours, can you imagine?  I used to love to  <br/>\nsee in Mothering Mag photos of kids at work with their parents, in a business,  <br/>\nthat was not actually owned by those parents.<br/>\nAmanda B.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11071,"nextTopicId":11074}}
