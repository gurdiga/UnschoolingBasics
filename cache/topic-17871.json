If I had a choice they  would NOT <br/>\nbe.  We live in NC where every homeschooler, to be compliant with  the law, <br/>\nhas to test every year and keep those test scores on hand at their  homeschool.  <br/>\nThe law does not state at what age to grade level they test or  any <br/>\nthreshhold.  So we use a computerized test that is very much like a  game, we do it at <br/>\nhome and I let my boys choose what &quot;grade&quot; they want to test  at.  Seeing how <br/>\nthey have never been to school at all the &quot;grade&quot; levels  mean nothing to them <br/>\nand tend to choose a &quot;grade&quot; they like the sounds of, or  their favorite <br/>\nnumber etc.  Actually when I think about it I have  absolutely no idea what grade <br/>\nthey would be in if they were in school.  Oh  well.  We test and I keep the <br/>\nresults on hand at our homeschool then I  chuck them.  No one looks at the <br/>\nscores.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway so in NC unschoolers are tested but I am not sure it is the kind of  <br/>\ntesting you are talking about ;-)<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23566,"nextTopicId":23574}}
