Nobody&#39;s gonna believe us. You wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nBELIEVE what hast just happened here!<br/>\n<br/>\nVernor Muñoz, the Special Correspondent of the UN wrote a report for  <br/>\nthe Right to obtain education. He wrote about how it was bad that in  <br/>\nGermany the circumstances are such, that people are threatend to be  <br/>\ndeprived of their right of custody when they tried to homeschool or  <br/>\nother kinds of non-school education. He expressed that although he  <br/>\nhimself is pro compulsory education, homeschooling was a valid form  <br/>\nof education.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe writes:<br/>\n“According to reports received, it is possible that, in some Länder  <br/>\n&lt;=states in Germany&gt;, education is understood exclusively to mean  <br/>\nschool attendance. Even though the Special Rapporteur is a strong  <br/>\nadvocate of public, free and compulsory education, it should be noted  <br/>\nthat education may not be reduced to mere school attendance and that  <br/>\neducational processes should be strengthened to ensure that they  <br/>\nalways and primarily serve the best interests of the child. Distance  <br/>\nlearning methods and home schooling represent valid options which  <br/>\ncould be developed in certain circumstances, bearing in mind that  <br/>\nparents have the right to choose the appropriate type of education  <br/>\nfor their children, as stipulated in article 13 of the International  <br/>\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The promotion and  <br/>\ndevelopment of a system of public, government-funded education should  <br/>\nnot entail the suppression of forms of education that do not require  <br/>\nattendance at a school. In this context, the Special Rapporteur  <br/>\nreceived complaints about threats to withdraw the parental rights of  <br/>\nparents who chose home-schooling methods for their children.”<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the translation to German though, they added: &quot;Distance learning  <br/>\nmethods and home schooling represent valid options which could be  <br/>\ndeveloped in certain circumstances, WHICH HAVE TO BE EXCEPTIONAL,   <br/>\nbearing in mind that parent...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s incredible!! this has been done because the law here already  <br/>\nstates that &quot;in certain circumstances&quot; you could homeschool. But they  <br/>\njust interpret that law as &quot;those circumstances have to be very  <br/>\nexceptional&quot;. So now they don&#39;t want to change anything and do as if  <br/>\nMuñoz said the same thing they&#39;ve been practising for decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, do you think unschoolers from the US would help us set up a  <br/>\ndatabase, if we try to set up a campaign, writing to all lists and  <br/>\nasking people to help us? It would be nice to be able to tell: &quot;In  <br/>\nthe US there are alredy X unschoolers&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings and Hugs<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUnerzogen!<br/>\nE-Mail: \t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a><br/>\nWebseite: \twww.unerzogen.de<br/>\nWiki: \t\twiki.unerzogen.de/<br/>\nRockzipfel: \trockzipfel.unerzogen.de/<br/>\n\t\t\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rockzipfel@...\">rockzipfel@...</a><br/>\nMailingliste:\tde.groups.yahoo.com/group/unerzogen/</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26434,"nextTopicId":26450}}
