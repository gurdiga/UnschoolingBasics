History of school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not an expert.  But here is what I&#39;ve discovered. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to John Gatto, modern day schools are structured on<br/>\nPrussian schools that began in the early 1800s.  The soldiers of<br/>\nPrussia were defeated by Napolean in 1806.  A german philosopeher<br/>\nnamed Fichte addressed the German people and basically told them that<br/>\nthey would have to shape up.  His method was to use forced schooling<br/>\nto teach everyone to take orders. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m paraphrasing this from &quot;Deschooling our Lives.&quot; It is from a talk<br/>\nthat John Taylor Gatto gave in 1991 called &quot;The Public School<br/>\nNightmare: Why fix a system designed to destroy individual thought?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe says:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So the world got compulsion schooling at the end of a state bayonet<br/>\nfor the first time in human history; modern forced schooling started<br/>\nin Prussia in 1819 with a clear vision of what centralized schools<br/>\ncould deliver:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) obedient soldiers to the army;<br/>\n2) obedient workers to the mines;<br/>\n3) well subordinated civil servants to government;<br/>\n4) well subordinated clerks to industry;<br/>\n5) citizens who thought alike about major issues.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe King of Prussia came to the U.S. in 1845 to determine the<br/>\nboundary between the U.S. and Canada.  This is when the U.S. adopted<br/>\nthe Prussian style of schooling.  The Prussian purpose of schools was<br/>\nto create a form a state socialism, and came to replace the American<br/>\npurpose of schools which was to create independent thinkers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I read this stuff it blew my socks of.  I mean, it really<br/>\nchanged my whole view of schooling.  You should read this article. <br/>\nHere is some more:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There were many more techniques of training, but all were built<br/>\naround the premise that isolation from first-had information, and<br/>\nfragmentation of the abstract information presented by teachers,<br/>\nwould result in obedient and subordinate graduates, properly<br/>\nrespectful of arbitrary orders.  &quot;Lesser&quot; men would be unable to<br/>\ninterfere with policy makers because, while they could still<br/>\ncomplain, they could not manage sustained or comprehensive thought.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s important to note that the underlying premise of Prussian<br/>\nschooling is hat the government is the true parent of children--the<br/>\nstate is sovereign over the family.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When Friedrich Froebel, the inventor of kindergarten in 19th century<br/>\nGermany, fashioned his idea, he did not have a &quot;garden for children&quot;<br/>\nin mind, but a metaphor of teachers as gardeners and children as the<br/>\nvegetables.  Kindergarten was created to be a way to break the<br/>\ninfluence of mothers on their children....The movement toward state<br/>\nsocilaism is not some historical curiosity but a powerful dynamic<br/>\nforce in the world around us.  It is fighting for its life against<br/>\nthose forces which would...deprive it of financial lifeblood, and it<br/>\nhas countered this thrust with a demand for even more control over<br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives, and even more money to pay for the extended school<br/>\nday and year that this control requires.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I take out of reading this is that school really wasn&#39;t<br/>\ncreated with the best interests of children in mind, and I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink this is the goal of schools today. It just isn&#39;t to the<br/>\nadvantage to those in power to have a population that can think for<br/>\nitself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many of my friends have kids that are aged 4-5 and are raving<br/>\nabout how excited they are to get their time back when the kids start<br/>\nschool.  It seems that school has become tax-funded daycare so that<br/>\nmoms and dads can work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more personal level, since being a stay at home mom, I&#39;ve<br/>\nthought about starting my own business.  After 17 years of school, I<br/>\nhave no idea of how to do about this.  But people are constantly<br/>\ncoming to America who can barely speak English and starting up shops<br/>\nand restaurants and becoming successful.  I wonder what they think of<br/>\nAmerican schools?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool didn&#39;t teach me how to make a living.  It taught me how to go<br/>\nto someone else to give me a job.  The assumption seems to be that<br/>\nyou go out and find a job, you get hired by someone.  You don&#39;t go<br/>\nout and make a job for yourself.  I blame the schools for making<br/>\nchildren into employees.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg.  I have to go now....I&#39;d love to<br/>\nchat more about this though.  Does anyone else have input on the role<br/>\nof the history of schools in their decision to unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jonell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.

I have two little guys: Ben who is 4 and Nick who will<br/>\nbe 1 next month.  I found this group from the alwayslearning group.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve come to believe that unschooling is the best thing for my kids,<br/>\nand the more I read about it the more and more of an advocate I<br/>\nbecome.  My family think I&#39;m nuts.  My friends think I&#39;ve gone off<br/>\nthe deep end.  Even my dh sometimes needs a good talking to about<br/>\nwhat I want (or rather, don&#39;t want) for my kids in regard to school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, my kids are not even old enough yet to go to school, even<br/>\nif I wanted them to.  I&#39;ve just finished reading a ton of intros from<br/>\nyou guys, and I&#39;m so glad to have this list as a resourse as my kids<br/>\nget older.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI live in a small mountain community where there are quite a few<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  Most of the hs&#39;ers I&#39;ve met so far (we moved here<br/>\nlast Oct.) are doing so for religious reasons.  Our town, pop. about<br/>\n2500, has a school that is the &quot;best&quot; in our county.  When I voice my<br/>\nintentions to unschool, I often get the comment, &quot;But the school here<br/>\nisn&#39;t so bad...actually it&#39;s really great.&quot;  Which it is, if you are<br/>\nwilling to accept school as a logical choice for your kids.  What<br/>\nbugs me most is that most of my friends haven&#39;t even really thought<br/>\nabout it.  They just assume, oh I went to school, so my kids will to,<br/>\nas if there really is no choice.  But most of my friends HATED<br/>\nschool, even if they did well there.  Maybe they think there kids<br/>\nshould have to go through it and hate it just like they did?  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to put Ben and Nick through all that baloney. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I cannot find enough hours in the day to do all the<br/>\nprojects and pursue all of our interests.  We are always reading,<br/>\nplaying, singing....learning. I feel that school robbed me of the<br/>\nability to know what I want and I am just now reclaiming that<br/>\nability.  I&#39;m 34.  I will not send my children to an institution that<br/>\ndoes not seem to have the best interests of children at heart.  The<br/>\nbest place they can be is here in the real world, with mom and dad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay maybe I&#39;m preaching to the choir but I wanted to get that off my<br/>\nchest.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJonell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
