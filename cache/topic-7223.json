I&#39;m new to unschooling too and<br/>\nwe are not into radical unschooling yet, I have much<br/>\nto learn and need hubby on board yet with that. <br/>\nHowever, I did receive a bit of information for a<br/>\ncouple of your issues at unschoolingdiscussion@yahoo. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling doesn&#39;t mean to allow the child to<br/>\nrun you down and run the house.  Also, Sandra Dodd had<br/>\nmentioned to another mother that when one begins this<br/>\njourney that things should be eased into, rather than<br/>\ngo (my words not hers :-)  Whole Hog)  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think that five is too young to stay up<br/>\nuntil all hours of the night, and that isn&#39;t what<br/>\nradical unschooling is about either.  It is about<br/>\nrespect and love and trust, not about giving up<br/>\ncontrol over your child and instead allowing them to<br/>\ncontrol you...KWIM?  It appears that this is what has<br/>\nhappened when I read your posts.  It&#39;s okay that he<br/>\nstays up later but I&#39;m sure that most would agree here<br/>\nthat because this was &quot;boom&quot; things are this way now,<br/>\ninstead of steady pace of transition.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the horse lessons, does he want to take them? <br/>\nIf not, drop them.  However, if he does, then you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have to coax him to get up and then deal<br/>\nwith him being grumpy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to offer some great advice that would give<br/>\nyou peace right away but I do not feel it&#39;s<br/>\nappropriate to do so.  Many here have done natural<br/>\nparenting from the get go and can give far better<br/>\nadvice.  Also, there are people here that weren&#39;t<br/>\nradical, who eased into letting go of control steadily<br/>\nand easily. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you<br/>\nSandy Winn <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Joanne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oh.kneel@...\">oh.kneel@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sorry for all the typos and errors, I needed to<br/>\n&gt; reach out and get <br/>\n&gt; support but I was interrupted so many times that<br/>\n&gt; after the spell check <br/>\n&gt; I  forgot to go back and read the text to make sure<br/>\n&gt; it made sense. :(  <br/>\n&gt; Hopefully you got the gist :) -  Joanne<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!
