Its not a simple matter for adults to make friends (and really, it isn&#39;t for kids, either, unless they happen to &quot;click&quot; well with their class-mates). Do you and your dd enjoy some of the same things?

Also check with anything like Human Services or Adult Education services - they may not have anything specifically set up, but may be able to refer you.

Telling her that isn&#39;t likely to make much of dent, though, she needs to be shown in ways that make sense to her, that feel good to her. When she feels loved, she will be able to give love back to you - but getting there may not look much like what you envision.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve said more than once, here and on another list, that you want a happy, connected family, with both kids at home. It may not be possible to have all those things at once! That doesn&#39;t make it bad or wrong to Want it - but it may be unrealistic. Or it may be totally realistic, but not today, not this month, not this year. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake the idea of &quot;both kids at home&quot; out of the mix and ask yourself what you can do to help your dd be happier, to connect with her more. There&#39;s already been a lot of discussion on ways you can do that - take some time to let all of that sink in, start putting some of it in motion, and see what happens (a week or two isn&#39;t long enough, this will take months!). But at the same time, say &quot;yes&quot; every time she says &quot;school&quot;. Look into scholarships and other educational options. Jump through hoops and bend over backwards trying to get her into whatever school she wants so she knows you value her desires and take them seriously. You won&#39;t be able to do that if you&#39;re all wound up thinking &quot;both kids at home&quot;, you&#39;ll resist. You&#39;ll be half-hearted and your dd will see that and think &quot;she doesn&#39;t Really care about me&quot;. So its really, really important to deal with your own feelings about having both kids home, and to grieve that you may not ever get to have that part of the dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds hard to say &quot;give up this parenting dream&quot;. I&#39;ve given up a few. Two years ago I gave up my dream of being the stay at home parent - now my partner does that. I had to get past the grief over what I didn&#39;t have to start to see and appreciate what I did have - to seem my real family living our real life. There&#39;s a lot to love in any family! Love your dd for Who She Is right now - contradictions and frustrations and all, and do everything in your power to support Who She Is right now, even if its not something you&#39;d prefer. That will do more to bring you closer to her, to bring more love and joy to your family, than trying to keep her home if she doesn&#39;t want to be there.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unhappy daughter.","postDate":"1246396146","msgId":40680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgyZHV0aStoNzJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgyY3JsZCsxN21lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40679,"nextInTopic":40684,"prevInTime":40679,"nextInTime":40681,"topicId":40664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have some experience with taking kids to a therapist/counselor while homeschooling with a curriculum and while unschooling. I am hopefully not entering the conversation too late to make sense.  You commented that  by taking your dd out of school  you may have &quot;created a bigger problem for her&quot; so something was going on before she left school? Plus she is painting herself in a corner, making sure that all options you offer are impossible. And she has mood swings. The reason I list these things is not to say that you should seek therapy, but only to say that if you do, there are other issues besides whether to attend school or not.  Also, it is summertime, when some schools are not in session.  Most therapists meet with the parent first (in this age range), and you will be voicing your concerns. In my experience, you can focus on her unhappiness, focus on how she walls herself in with choices<br/>\n (such as wanting only to play with the friend who is at camp all day), you can focus on her mood swings.  You can let the therapist get to know you and your dd.  Let the therapist find out that you are a very involved parent, who thinks creatively and with full engagement about your kids.  This is a great luxury to most therapists, whose clients are often from a far less supportive background. You can slowly let the learning approach for your family emerge.  If you are still in the deschooling phase, and your dd is in such a period of dramatic transition (just being an 11 yo girl is hard), you may want to be careful not to appear to be seeking advice on wheter to homeschool or unschool.  I had one therapist that thought everything about my dd centered on homeschooling.  She was always saying, &quot;Since you homeschool you are around each other too much.  Since you homeschool, blah, blah....&quot;  Emily first asked to quit her and we did.  Now I have a<br/>\n therapist with whom I have not yet discussed homeschooling and my 10 yo ds has a therapist he really likes, who is aware that we homeschool but I have not focused on it as a &#39;problem&#39; because I don&#39;t see it as one.  Of course if the child herself sees it as a problem it will come out in the sessions. There you have the summer season on your side; many kids aren&#39;t going to school right now.  Watch what the therapist says.  You probably have time to decide it the therapist can mesh with your dd and your family.  I would not attempt to describe and define unschooling right away! That&#39;s just my &#39;2 cents!&#39; Cameron<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: sistergoddesselli &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:elinorsparks@...\">elinorsparks@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:07:25 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] unhappy daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still struggling with my daughter...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter keeps asking to go back to school. We started homeschooling in January. She is 11. She seems so happy at times and then so miserable. She made a list of pros and cons. The homeschooling pros outweigh the cons and the school cons were many, yet still, she wants to be back in school. Her friends will all be going to different middle schools and our neighborhood school would not be a good match for her and I don&#39;t know if I can get her into the school she&#39;d like to attend and she often asks for a private school, which we can&#39;t afford. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like for her to be happy and yet, now I am feeling like there is absolutely no good option...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also stays up all night right now, playing on her new Apple lap top. Late at night she gets most depressed and during the day, she says she has no energy. And, she wants to play with her friends but only asks for one, who is in camp all day. So, she wants camp, which we can&#39;t afford as I am no longer working full time.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has expressed interests and I am lining up opportunities for her to explore those. Singing, archery, sailing, computer classes...<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;ve created a bigger problem for her by pulling her out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about taking her to a counselor and I am afraid of that because I&#39;ll have to explain unschooling to the counselor... well I am not sure of how it will be received.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp, again!!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Elli<br/>\n<br/>\nps. My son, 8, seems content and has come around to wanting more in his life than TV and computers after months of de-schooling. Also, he is putting himself to bed earlier so he has energy during the day now. And, he is reaching out to friends for play-dates. So, I know that moving through de-schooling is possible in our house. Just don&#39;t know what I can do to help daughter...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":97123747,"authorName":"Janice Reynolds","from":"Janice Reynolds &lt;momsformilk@...&gt;","profile":"honeywoodgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: meeting her needs","postDate":"1246383554","msgId":40685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU4MkMyQjcwOTVBQTQzMDlCM0VDNzgxNjdCMkUxMEI4QEJvYj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0ODcwNy4xMTA4NC5xbUB3ZWIzNjkwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDI0ODcwNy4xMTA4NC5xbUB3ZWIzNjkwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40684,"nextInTopic":40686,"prevInTime":40684,"nextInTime":40686,"topicId":40664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think I could have written your post.

If she goes back, it is<br/>\nmostly in order for her to have more contact with other kids.  We live in a<br/>\nvery small town (less than 50 kids in our K-12 school) and there will only<br/>\nbe 8 kids in her grade 6-8 triple-graded classroom if she goes back.  So<br/>\nwhether she goes back or not, there are few friends to choose from.   Plus<br/>\nshe doesnt find the kids around her to be very interesting or exciting (ie<br/>\nthey have little imagination and dont like to play much).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, we have met other hsers in the city that is 1 ½ hours from us.

So to her it doesnt really matter where<br/>\nthey are, as long as they have MSN and webcams.  She is more interested in<br/>\nfinding kids with the time to talk to her, and similar interests.  Of course<br/>\nshed love to have close friends, that she could play with IRL, but unless<br/>\nwe move, it isnt going to happen.

I hear a LOT of negatives in your post.  I feel it is important to support your daughter and help her meet her needs in the best way possible.  She wants to go to school, but you are coming up with every reason in the book why she can not go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Heather<br/>\nwww.swissarmywife.net<br/>\n======================================================================</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237471585,"authorName":"sistergoddesselli","from":"&quot;sistergoddesselli&quot; &lt;elinorsparks@...&gt;","profile":"sistergoddesselli","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"unhappy daughter.","postDate":"1246360045","msgId":40666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgyY3JsZCsxN21lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgyYm9jditnNHBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40664,"nextInTopic":40667,"prevInTime":40665,"nextInTime":40667,"topicId":40664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am still struggling with my daughter...

We started homeschooling in January.  She is 11.  She seems so happy at times and then so miserable.  She made a list of pros and cons.  The homeschooling pros outweigh the cons and the school cons were many, yet still, she wants to be back in school.  Her friends will all be going to different middle schools and our neighborhood school would not be a good match for her and I don&#39;t know if I can get her into the school she&#39;d like to attend and she often asks for a private school, which we can&#39;t afford.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like for her to be happy and yet, now I am feeling like there is absolutely no good option...<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also stays up all night right now, playing on her new Apple lap top.  Late at night she gets most depressed and during the day, she says she has no energy.  And, she wants to play with her friends but only asks for one, who is in camp all day.  So, she wants camp, which we can&#39;t afford as I am no longer working full time.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has expressed interests and I am lining up opportunities for her to explore those.  Singing, archery, sailing, computer classes...<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;ve created a bigger problem for her by pulling her out of school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking about taking her to a counselor and I am afraid of that because I&#39;ll have to explain unschooling to the counselor... well I am not sure of how it will be received.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp, again!!<br/>\n<br/>\n- Elli<br/>\n<br/>\nps.  My son, 8, seems content and has come around to wanting more in his life than TV and computers after months of de-schooling.  Also, he is putting himself to bed earlier so he has energy during the day now.  And, he is reaching out to friends for play-dates.  So, I know that moving through de-schooling is possible in our house.  Just don&#39;t know what I can do to help daughter...</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159296323,"authorName":"amandajlear","from":"&quot;amandajlear&quot; &lt;amandajlear@...&gt;","profile":"amandajlear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: meeting her needs","postDate":"1246345963","msgId":40671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgyY2R0Yis3dGw3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgyYm9jditnNHBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40670,"nextInTopic":40674,"prevInTime":40670,"nextInTime":40672,"topicId":40664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can empathise with you.

We have just arrived from the UK so no idea where we are here yet :)  but at home, we were 20 miles to the nearest HS community and I was worn out from driving, feeling frustrating and fed up and having a rotten time of it.  My ds ditto.  Bet 20 miles is a giggle to the driving you all do here :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we stopped doing all the running about for about 3 months and then we both relaxed.  DS met children in the same road just from being about the right age finally - then 4 3/4s so able to play / cycle about whilst I pretended to garden.  We started doing things together and we just went to the odd HS thing.  We had a lovely time bashing museums, going for walks, cycle rides, visits to the park etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily for us, and unbeknown to us at the time, various other hs parents felt the same.  We all ended up converging around the same time and we very sadly left that very happy group to move overseas, but what a wonderful time we had in just a few short months.  I can&#39;t say that this will happen for you just this was my very recent experience<br/>\n<br/>\nYou haven&#39;t said how old your daughter is?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have neighbours?  Do you have a local library - we found that a great contact point in our village back in the UK.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I have been some help, if nothing else than to say you are not alone, don&#39;t give up quite yet :)  This is a tough choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;ldyblunh&quot; &lt;terri7b@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; i have an only child, a very socially oriented girl who thrives on being with people.   we dont have friends in the immediate area;  they&#39;re all about 45 mins away so the impromptu stuff never happens and she gets forgotten out of a lot of stuff.   the apartment is far far far too small to host.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; as much as i want to continue homeschooling --- im trying to be honest about her needs;  she needs the social contacts!!   yes i know the social contacts in school suck swamp water;  but it would be a lot more than i seem to be able to offer her  :(     [and yes we&#39;ve been involved in the hs community TONS!  its a huge detriment to me and what i can offer her at home in fact because of how much we&#39;re travelling as none of the community is &#39;local&#39; ]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":296037108,"authorName":"ldyblunh","from":"&quot;ldyblunh&quot; &lt;terri7b@...&gt;","profile":"ldyblunh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"meeting her needs","postDate":"1246323935","msgId":40664,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgyYm9jditnNHBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40666,"prevInTime":40663,"nextInTime":40665,"topicId":40664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i have an only child, a very socially oriented girl who thrives on being with people.   we dont have friends in the immediate area;  they re all about 45 mins","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1336572870\">i have an only child, a very socially oriented girl who thrives on being with people.   we dont have friends in the immediate area;  they&#39;re all about 45 mins away so the impromptu stuff never happens and she gets forgotten out of a lot of stuff.   the apartment is far far far too small to host.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nas much as i want to continue homeschooling --- im trying to be honest about her needs;  she needs the social contacts!!   yes i know the social contacts in school suck swamp water;  but it would be a lot more than i seem to be able to offer her  :(     [and yes we&#39;ve been involved in the hs community TONS!  its a huge detriment to me and what i can offer her at home in fact because of how much we&#39;re travelling as none of the community is &#39;local&#39; ]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40730,"nextTopicId":40733}}
