You&#39;ll find that lots of people  <br/>\ngo through this process. My experience is that most people who embrace the  <br/>\nlearning parts of unschooling eventually find that it moves into other parts of  <br/>\ntheir and their children&#39;s lives.  You seem to get the learning part pretty  <br/>\nwell, and my guess is that you WILL end up embracing other parts. Or maybe  not.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe grow up being told that education is the job of professionals, and that  <br/>\ngood parents are lovingly strict with their children. So, we&#39;re here saying <br/>\nthat  not only can kids learn at home, but that we don&#39;t even have at sit down at <br/>\nthe  kitchen table and teach them and test them. THEN we go on to say that we <br/>\ncan let  kids make decisions about bedtime and chores and other <br/>\nstuff....argh! How scary  is that!?<br/>\n <br/>\nKeep hanging out here, keep reading, maybe come to a conference and meet  <br/>\nsome of these weird people in person.

(By the way, she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t typically nap anymore so this is outside of our usual <br/>\nroutine.) To me that is guidance but not control.

But I do let them know it&#39;s <br/>\ngetting late, what we have planned, how early everyone has to get up <br/>\nor not get up or did get up that day.  And then we just do our <br/>\nroutine and they go to bed.  I guess I just don&#39;t see that as <br/>\ncontrolling.

I think young kids need some guidance in that area.<br/>\n&gt; Remember, we do not have arbitrary bedtimes and while you can put a<br/>\n&gt; child to bed you cannot make them go to sleep.  I know this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are parents who write here who ARE struggling - nearly always  <br/>\nit is those who have had pretty inflexible parent-set bedtimes and  <br/>\nthen, often literally overnight &lt;g&gt;, they removed the set bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who have BEEN controlled and coerced will take time, sometimes a  <br/>\nlot of time, to get over that. In the meantime, they&#39;ll often behave  <br/>\nin ways that are clearly against their own self-interest (going to  <br/>\nbed when sleepy, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nALSO - the parents haven&#39;t built up a big pile of trust credit, yet,  <br/>\nso they don&#39;t get to say, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re getting sleepy - want to  <br/>\ncuddle with me and fall asleep?&quot; Their kids RESIST that (because, in  <br/>\nthe past, their parents made them try to sleep on an arbitrary  <br/>\nschedule) - but those who have been raised in true freedom, have no  <br/>\nresistance, they&#39;re HAPPY and content to recognize their own sleepiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nLifestyles are different, too. There is one family here who has one  <br/>\nchild and very flexible scheduling in their lives and can pretty much  <br/>\nwork around any sleep schedule their daughter happens to choose. My  <br/>\nfamily of three kids is very active and has lots of scheduled  <br/>\nappointments and obligations - my kids keep themselves pretty well  <br/>\naware of what tomorrow will have in store for them and they adjust  <br/>\ntheir sleep accordingly (being teens, they do sometimes choose far  <br/>\nLESS sleep than I could handle as a 53 year old). Even when they were  <br/>\nyounger, though, they were very aware of the consequences of staying  <br/>\nup too late and not having a good day the next day because of fatigue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say in the quote, above, that you think young kids need some  <br/>\nguidance.

If I ask, &quot;Are you getting sleepy?&quot; they had no  <br/>\nreason to immediately start claiming they&#39;re NOT sleepy - that&#39;s what  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen in other people&#39;s homes, over and over. Mom says, &quot;Are you  <br/>\ngetting sleepy?&quot; Kid says, &quot;No, no, no I want to stay up more.&quot; Mom  <br/>\nsays, &quot;Well, it is getting late, so how about 10 more minutes.&quot; Kid  <br/>\nsays, &quot;I&#39;m NOT sleepy, REALLY, Mom, pleeeeeease can&#39;t I stay up  <br/>\nmore?&quot; Mom: &quot;No, it is time for bed.

He has very little concept of danger and is not patient enough yet to wait until somebody is able to help him do things.  So he ends up in situations that scare the pants off me...even when I am fully awake.  So Dan doesn&#39;t stay up late without us....sometimes we all stay up together, sometimes he sleeps with me, sometimes I massage his feet, sometimes I read him a story, but I &quot;gentle&quot; him into resting.

If Zach wants to stay up but is loud and is interfering with people&#39;s sleep, then we try to find a solution.  If we are unable to find a solution and Zach is unwilling to tone down the noise, then Zach&#39;s staying up all night is tabled until we can find a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: thetaberskifamily &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thetaberskifamily@...\">thetaberskifamily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, November 1, 2005 8:20 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: clarification<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n&gt; &lt;pamsoroosh@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Of course they do.

We went through an entire year (after a death in the <br/>\n&gt; family, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a move, and leaving a very legalistic church that we were raised <br/>\n&gt; in) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that we basically didn&#39;t do anything except sit around the house <br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; play and my kids are FINE!  We don&#39;t label things &quot;education&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or &quot;schoolish&quot;, we live a fun and interesting life and they <br/>\n&gt; learn <br/>\n&gt; &gt; things through living.  I don&#39;t really give any thought to what <br/>\n&gt; they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; you are almost there, is simply trusting that your kids will <br/>\n&gt; learn <br/>\n&gt; &gt; what they need to know to get along in this big ol&#39; world.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am there....I see what goes on and just can&#39;t imagine it ever <br/>\n&gt; stopping!  I read somewhere that an intense interest will lead <br/>\n&gt; everywhere and that is absolutely at the core of what I believe.  <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; was indeed taking my example to the extreme (I can&#39;t imagine them <br/>\n&gt; NOT <br/>\n&gt; being interested in SOMETHING that was going to result in true <br/>\n&gt; learning).  I guess I was wondering if that was something that <br/>\n&gt; went <br/>\n&gt; on in your homes/lives.  Children &quot;choosing&quot; to not learn through <br/>\n&gt; their interests/passions.  And sorry, I don&#39;t consider watching <br/>\n&gt; television 8 to 10 hours a day for months and months on end very <br/>\n&gt; high <br/>\n&gt; in the area of quality learning (yes, lots of learning comes <br/>\n&gt; through <br/>\n&gt; television, even in our home - I think sometimes a shockingly <br/>\n&gt; large <br/>\n&gt; amount - lol).  There&#39;d be some serious sparking of other <br/>\n&gt; interests <br/>\n&gt; going on at that point in our home.<br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as the movies etc. that you feel they shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\n&gt; watching, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; etc................Are there things that you watch or are <br/>\n&gt; exposed <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that you just don&#39;t care for and then decide not to watch or be <br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; part <br/>\n&gt; &gt; of?  Does your husband ever tell you &quot;Sorry honey, you can&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; watch <br/>\n&gt; &gt; that, it is just not something you should be watching.&quot;  You <br/>\n&gt; decide <br/>\n&gt; &gt; those things for yourself right?

Are they asking to watch something you think you need  <br/>\nto filter?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 20, 18, and 14. When they were little they wanted to  <br/>\nwatch Mr. Rogers and other PBS children&#39;s shows, mostly. They were  <br/>\nthrilled with a few Disney movies (Beauty and the Beast, for example)  <br/>\nand scared of others. I&#39;m wondering where your kids are getting the  <br/>\nidea of watching things you think need to be filtered?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m STILL telling my kids not to watch &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot;  <br/>\nbecause i think it&#39;ll be disturbing. There are movies I wish I&#39;d  <br/>\nnever watched (as an adult). But, these days, my kids are more likely  <br/>\nto warn ME about something - tell me when they think I won&#39;t like it.  <br/>\nMy almost-21 year old rented the first season of &quot;Lost&quot; earlier this  <br/>\nweek. She told me I probably wouldn&#39;t like it - too gory in the first  <br/>\ncouple of episodes and it involves paranormal stuff which she knows  <br/>\nalways seems really boring to me (X-Files, for example, just put me  <br/>\nto sleep).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt SEEMS like you think that the kids will want to do some pretty  <br/>\nstupid things if adults don&#39;t set limits - stay up all night, watch  <br/>\ninappropriate tv, eat junk food?  AND this is typically true, so I  <br/>\ncan see how one would believe it. It is true of kids who live in a  <br/>\nworld of limits. But kids who live in a world of opportunities and  <br/>\nsupport and help in getting what they want, rather than constraints  <br/>\nand controls, seem to be able to &quot;choose&quot; intelligently for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nRosie (my 14 yo) is at an overnight Halloween party tonight. I have  <br/>\nabsolutely no doubt that she&#39;ll eat well - probably won&#39;t even eat  <br/>\nany candy at all - maybe will have a piece of pie, plus some regular  <br/>\nfood. She&#39;ll stay up a bit too late (it is a party) and she&#39;ll go in  <br/>\nthe other room and do something else if a too-scary movie is watched.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana is at a party where there will be alcohol - it is mostly  <br/>\ncollege students, ages from about 16 to 30 or so. She won&#39;t drink,  <br/>\nshe won&#39;t get in a car with anybody who has been drinking. If there  <br/>\nis too much drinking, she&#39;ll get bored and she&#39;ll get a ride home  <br/>\nwith somebody who hasn&#39;t had anything to drink or she&#39;ll call me.

I remember watching horror movies (sneaking) at <br/>\nfriends houses that I could get away with it because I was intrigued.  <br/>\nMy parents said I couldn&#39;t watch them but did it stop me?  Absolutely <br/>\nnot.  I found out on my own that I don&#39;t care for them because they <br/>\nfreak me out so I don&#39;t watch them anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had an incident last night where my daughter wanted to watch the <br/>\nProphecy and I was a little leary because I know she is very sensitive <br/>\nand gets nightmares so my husband told her about every scary part of <br/>\nthe movie and we talked about how that might make her feel to watch <br/>\nthat.  She said that it would probably make her feel bad but she still <br/>\nwanted to watch it.  I told her that I would be in my room so if she <br/>\ngot scared she could come sit with me.  Within five minutes she was in <br/>\nmy room telling me that her eyes told her they didn&#39;t want to watch <br/>\nthose things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is all about letting go and trusting that your kids will figure out <br/>\nthose things on there own.  Someone on one of these lists has this on <br/>\ntheir signature line, from a website:  This deep self, our wise and <br/>\nknowing simple animal being, when not interfered with unerringly, <br/>\ninstinctively moves us toward that which grows and nurtures us.  Just <br/>\nas unfailing, it moves us away from all that endangers us on any <br/>\nlevel.  Robyn Posin<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, from experience with my children, that this is very true.  It <br/>\nis all about TRUST!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\nChildren aren&#39;t coloring books.  You can&#39;t fill them with your <br/>\nfavorite colors.

He hasn&#39;t always. He didn&#39;t get his first one until he was 13, but now he&#39;s passionate about them. He has friends online that he plays with, he reads magazines about them, searches for cheat codes, watches shows about them, dresses up as characters for Halloween, etc. Do I think it&#39;s okay. Yes. Do I also offer lots of opportunities to expand his world in other ways. Yes! And even with his passion for gaming, he also reads lots, goes to museums, nourishes his spiritual side, loves science and history shows, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in this case you&#39;re taking the scenario out to an extreme that doesn&#39;t exist. My son is a gamer first and foremost. He still has lots of other interests and pursuits.
