I pulled <br/>\nout my old box of 64 (I&#39;m a pack rat, and it was from the days that <br/>\nthat WAS the Big Box!), and he happily sorted through the colors, <br/>\nwalked around commenting things like, &quot;That car is a nice cerulan.&quot;  <br/>\n(I admit, I don&#39;t have a normal child!)

Last summer, he decided he was going to make a <br/>\ncomic strip out of legos taking pictures with his digital camera<br/>\nbecause, &quot;I can&#39;t draw; I&#39;m no good at it.&quot;  Exact quote.  A month or <br/>\nso later, he was taking a class, once a week (with a homeschool <br/>\neducational support thingy) called the creatives.  The first class <br/>\nwas actually not much, but he ended up with a sketch pad, and started <br/>\nsketching.  I was SHOCKED.  He drew very well, with great perspective <br/>\nand shading.

Barnes and Nobles and teacher supply stores<br/>\nhave a good selection. I would take him with you and see what he<br/>\nlikes. Also, don&#39;t forget games (like word searches and suduko). Even<br/>\nif you don&#39;t want to do workbooks, I would search for the best<br/>\nquality, most interesting ones you can find. There is alot of crap out<br/>\nthere that really is a waste of time. Maybe he would like scrapbooking<br/>\nhis projects. That seems like a creative way to enter into<br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/13/06, Joanne &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi Ellen...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can buy workbooks anywhere.
