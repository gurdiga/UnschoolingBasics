You made a really hard decision  to ask your  daughter <br/>\nto  <br/>\nleave, NOT because you don&#39;t love her or want her, but because you   had to <br/>\nprotect the whole family. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s angry. Hopefully her  grandmother  <br/>\nwill <br/>\ncare for her without buying into her anger. Stay in  touch with her. Call  <br/>\nher <br/>\nevery day, even if she won&#39;t talk to you.  Not to process or discuss her  <br/>\nissues, but just checking in.  Encourage the other kids to stay in touch with <br/>\nher  <br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood  luck:)<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not calling, but am emailing or text messaging very often. I always  <br/>\ntell her I love her, and I do my best to convey love and strength, kwim? It&#39;s so  <br/>\nhard. <br/>\n <br/>\nYes, how I chose to show my love to her and the family as a until has ben a  <br/>\nhard and bitter pill fr me to swallow...I just never thought I&#39;d do that..ever <br/>\n feel I had no other options...<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for your support, Kathryn.
