Have you read much on how people learn?  My  <br/>\nfavorite book <br/>\n&gt; right now is the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank  Smith.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Some random questions to get you started thinking and have fun <br/>\nwith:  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - What do I want for my children to be as adults?  Happy?   <br/>\nContent?  Harvard <br/>\n&gt; graduate?<br/>\n&gt; Why?  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - How do I give them what they need to be that?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - Would I truly care if my child was the most joyful person on <br/>\nEarth, but  <br/>\n&gt; only a fry cook at McDonald&#39;s? (Most people tell me they do care <br/>\nvery much that  <br/>\n&gt; their kid is &quot;only&quot; something or other....and those kids are not <br/>\nradically  <br/>\n&gt; unschooled).  If that is the case, is that serving the child&#39;s <br/>\nneeds or my  <br/>\n&gt; own?  Is that OK with me?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - What is more important, to be someone that is knowledgeable <br/>\nabout  facts or <br/>\n&gt; to be someone who is eager and able to learn?  How might you  help <br/>\nsomeone be <br/>\n&gt; eager?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - Are facts really necessary in the technological age?  (Hint: we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t even <br/>\n&gt; have to leave our homes anymore to get most necessary  <br/>\ninformation.....and <br/>\n&gt; much of it is instantaneous)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - How do you learn about a new hobby?  By learning everything  <br/>\nabout it <br/>\n&gt; before you attempt it, or by learning as you go along?  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - If you had a whole year to do anything you wanted (and all of <br/>\nyour basic  <br/>\n&gt; needs were taken care of....food, shelter, cleaning), what would <br/>\nyou do?   <br/>\n&gt; Note:  at first you might do things you normally didn&#39;t get a <br/>\nchance to  like read <br/>\n&gt; non-stop or watch movies non-stop or a favorite hobby non-stop.   <br/>\nBut that <br/>\n&gt; would get boring after awhile.  You would eventually get tuned in  <br/>\nto your own <br/>\n&gt; rhythms and would have times when you wanted to be around people <br/>\nand  others <br/>\n&gt; when you wanted to be alone.   Times when you wanted to work  and <br/>\naccomplish <br/>\n&gt; things, times when you wanted to just chill out.  Times when  you <br/>\nhad so many <br/>\n&gt; thoughts you wanted to organize them on paper, times when you  <br/>\njust wanted to be <br/>\n&gt; still.  You might pick up a new hobby to give it a try,  you might <br/>\nfinish a <br/>\n&gt; project or leave it until later.  If you truly honored  these <br/>\nrhythms, don&#39;t you <br/>\n&gt; think you would be content?  Isn&#39;t everything the  best use of <br/>\nyour time and <br/>\n&gt; your brain?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - What will the future be like?  Will my child need the same <br/>\nskills  and <br/>\n&gt; facts I do?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - Could a child who has been given the gift of using his time and <br/>\nbrain  <br/>\n&gt; exactly how it feels the best have not a &quot;well-trained mind&quot; but <br/>\na &quot;well-used  <br/>\n&gt; mind&quot;?  Wouldn&#39;t the &quot;well-used mind&quot; have amassed plenty of <br/>\nfactual  knowledge, <br/>\n&gt; too?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - What if the &quot;well-trained mind&quot; has no use in the future because <br/>\nwhat it  <br/>\n&gt; has been trained in has become useless?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - Could a &quot;well-used mind&quot; continue to adapt to changing  <br/>\ncircumstances?  <br/>\n&gt; Could it become a &quot;useful mind&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; - What if to that &quot;well-used mind&quot; you added your love and joy <br/>\nand  interest <br/>\n&gt; and support?  The gift to your child is also that he *knows*  he <br/>\nis loved and <br/>\n&gt; cared for and his ideas are valid and important.

I researched homeschooling starting over 2 <br/>\nyears ago, then found unschooling.  I remember I first thought &quot;no <br/>\nway!  That sounds WAY to loose for me!&quot;.  I kept reading (have you read <br/>\nany John Holt, John Taylor Gatto, there are others) and kept coming <br/>\nBACK to unschooling.  Something about it resonated with me.   And, more <br/>\nimportantly, what made more sense to me was what I was reading about <br/>\neducation.   I&#39;ve always been interested in learning styles (this has <br/>\nbeen the issue with my dd and the cause of her &quot;problems&quot; in school - <br/>\nthey felt she was &quot;broken&quot; and needed to be fixed - that&#39;s a very <br/>\nsimplistic explanation, I won&#39;t go into our story right now, I may have <br/>\nposted it here when I first joined, I&#39;ll have to see what I wrote).<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren learn things at very different paces, so if they&#39;re not ready <br/>\nto &quot;learn&quot; whatever the schools say they SHOULD be learning in grade 3 <br/>\nor whatever, so what!  Does that mean they&#39;ve failed?   And also, <br/>\nsomething I never thought about before, WHY do children need to &quot;learn&quot; <br/>\nthe things listed for each grade in that particular year?   Think about <br/>\nit - try to get away from &quot;thinking like the masses&quot; JUST BECAUSE it&#39;s <br/>\nalways been that way, think more about, what&#39;s REALLY important to know <br/>\n(and it will vary for each child).   Yes, it&#39;s good to be able to read, <br/>\nwrite somewhat (or type, computers/internet), do some basic math <br/>\n(balance a checkbook someday or budget your money, make change), but <br/>\nbeyond that, how much do YOU remember of what was &quot;taught&quot; to you in <br/>\nschool?  Algebra?  Shakespeare?  Table of elements in chem?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI happen to LOVE math, and both my dd and dh ABHOR it!  I love to read <br/>\nfor pleasure, neither of them do.  But I KNOW my daughter can read, she <br/>\nhas a wonderful vocabulary because we talk, discuss thoughts and <br/>\nideas.  Not all learning occurs in a book, nor does it occur in <br/>\nschool.   We&#39;re learning all the time, life long learning, it should <br/>\nnever stop!  It should be a JOY to learn about new things, not hated <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re forced to learn something either we&#39;re not interested in <br/>\nor not ready for (but maybe it will be something we would have <br/>\ndiscovered on our own if allowed to at our own pace).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS hard to change our perception of what true learning is!  You <br/>\ncan&#39;t, nor should you, ignore your own experience of what &quot;learning&quot; <br/>\nis.  It IS hard for many people who have not unschooled from the <br/>\nbeginning to &quot;get it&quot; (can you see me raising my hand!  me too! me <br/>\ntoo!).   Read, read, and read some more about unschooling (check under <br/>\nthe Links part of this group for book recommendations, websites, etc).  <br/>\nSome people may even post their favorite book or website, the ONE that <br/>\ndid it for them.  For me, it was &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; by John Taylor <br/>\nGatto.   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-</a><br/>\n/0865714487/qid=1126898108/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9013486-3932159?<br/>\nv=glance&s=books&n=507846   There are MANY more (we moved a while back <br/>\nand my books are still in boxes so I can&#39;t just glance over at my <br/>\nbookcase to see what they are, but I&#39;m going to make a list for <br/>\nsharing).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk questions, read the archives here, try to be open to a new way of <br/>\nthinking.

I had the same reactions in <br/>\nthe beginning, but I slowed down and took time to absorb what was being <br/>\nsaid to me and truly realized that the people on this site WANT to <br/>\nhelp, they&#39;re really good at getting to the heart of what they &quot;hear&quot; <br/>\nyou saying as opposed to what you &quot;think&quot; you&#39;re saying (if that makes <br/>\nsense!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I wanted to chime in as a newbie who&#39;s getting it but also <br/>\nstruggled with &quot;letting go&quot; of the &quot;traditional&quot; way of viewing <br/>\neducation, school and learning.   I&#39;m so grateful for the wisdom of the <br/>\npeople on this group.   I hope you will grow as you read, question, <br/>\nlisten, experience the joy that unschooling can bring to your life.<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: new unschoolers","postDate":"1126897926","msgId":6568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxN0MyMjE4LUU1MDYtNDgzNC1BNThBLUZGNzhDMzdBRTE3RkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRnZWJ1OCs2cW1oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRnZWJ1OCs2cW1oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6567,"nextInTopic":6569,"prevInTime":6567,"nextInTime":6569,"topicId":6545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Have you read much on how people learn?  My  favorite book <br/>\nright now is the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank  Smith.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome random questions to get you started thinking and have fun with:  <br/>\n <br/>\n- What do I want for my children to be as adults?  Happy?   Content?  Harvard <br/>\ngraduate?<br/>\nWhy?  <br/>\n <br/>\n- How do I give them what they need to be that?<br/>\n <br/>\n- Would I truly care if my child was the most joyful person on Earth, but  <br/>\nonly a fry cook at McDonald&#39;s? (Most people tell me they do care very much that  <br/>\ntheir kid is &quot;only&quot; something or other....and those kids are not radically  <br/>\nunschooled).  If that is the case, is that serving the child&#39;s needs or my  <br/>\nown?  Is that OK with me?<br/>\n <br/>\n- What is more important, to be someone that is knowledgeable about  facts or <br/>\nto be someone who is eager and able to learn?  How might you  help someone be <br/>\neager?<br/>\n <br/>\n- Are facts really necessary in the technological age?  (Hint: we  don&#39;t even <br/>\nhave to leave our homes anymore to get most necessary  information.....and <br/>\nmuch of it is instantaneous)<br/>\n <br/>\n- How do you learn about a new hobby?  By learning everything  about it <br/>\nbefore you attempt it, or by learning as you go along?  <br/>\n <br/>\n- If you had a whole year to do anything you wanted (and all of your basic  <br/>\nneeds were taken care of....food, shelter, cleaning), what would you do?   <br/>\nNote:  at first you might do things you normally didn&#39;t get a chance to  like read <br/>\nnon-stop or watch movies non-stop or a favorite hobby non-stop.   But that <br/>\nwould get boring after awhile.  You would eventually get tuned in  to your own <br/>\nrhythms and would have times when you wanted to be around people and  others <br/>\nwhen you wanted to be alone.   Times when you wanted to work  and accomplish <br/>\nthings, times when you wanted to just chill out.  Times when  you had so many <br/>\nthoughts you wanted to organize them on paper, times when you  just wanted to be <br/>\nstill.  You might pick up a new hobby to give it a try,  you might finish a <br/>\nproject or leave it until later.  If you truly honored  these rhythms, don&#39;t you <br/>\nthink you would be content?  Isn&#39;t everything the  best use of your time and <br/>\nyour brain?<br/>\n <br/>\n- What will the future be like?  Will my child need the same skills  and <br/>\nfacts I do?<br/>\n <br/>\n- Could a child who has been given the gift of using his time and brain  <br/>\nexactly how it feels the best have not a &quot;well-trained mind&quot; but a &quot;well-used  <br/>\nmind&quot;?  Wouldn&#39;t the &quot;well-used mind&quot; have amassed plenty of factual  knowledge, <br/>\ntoo?<br/>\n <br/>\n- What if the &quot;well-trained mind&quot; has no use in the future because what it  <br/>\nhas been trained in has become useless?<br/>\n <br/>\n- Could a &quot;well-used mind&quot; continue to adapt to changing  circumstances?  <br/>\nCould it become a &quot;useful mind&quot;?<br/>\n <br/>\n- What if to that &quot;well-used mind&quot; you added your love and joy and  interest <br/>\nand support?  The gift to your child is also that he *knows*  he is loved and <br/>\ncared for and his ideas are valid and important.  What  sort of person will <br/>\nthat child grow up to be?  <br/>\n <br/>\nHave a joy filled day!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177228752,"authorName":"Julie-TX","from":"Julie-TX &lt;julie3k2c1h@...&gt;","profile":"julie3k2c1h","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new unschoolers","postDate":"1126877948","msgId":6564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwOTE2MTMzOTA4LjEyMjg5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxMDAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzg3QzI5ODcyRjE1RC01QzQtODQwNUBtYmxrLXIyMy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":6563,"nextInTopic":6565,"prevInTime":6563,"nextInTime":6565,"topicId":6545,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have just been incredibly busy with life !

How did you get there?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it was easier for me because I first learned of unschooling when my oldest daughter was only 2 years old.  I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it for older kids (back then), but it made complete sense to me for toddlers and preschoolers. Little kids are learning machines.  Language acquisition, for one thing, is so amazing!  Look at what they do when they&#39;re so little, picking up the complexities of language, and all they need is other people talking with them.  I just spent time playing and talking with my girls and watched them learn despite my sparse follow through on structured pre-planned activities.  Now Rhiannon is self-motivated to learn to read and figure out how adding and subtracting works, and how the world works in general, naturally.  And since she is only 4 and there&#39;s no rush it has been easy to relax and watch her and wait to be asked for help rather than trying to actively teach her.  I&#39;m lucky, really, that I have discovered unschooling so early, so I can see it<br/>\n working, naturally, at such a young age before academics seem more &quot;serious.&quot;  Not sure I&#39;m being clear, sorry.  It&#39;s late, I&#39;m getting sleepy.  Feel free to ask me to explain better.<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey wrote:  I used to live in Falls Church.

My name is Stacey.  I have four <br/>\nkids.  dd 7, ds 5, ds 2, and ds 8 months. We are an American family <br/>\nliving in Saudi Arabia.  This is our first year fulltime <br/>\nhomeschooling. Right now we are using a curriculum, a school in a <br/>\nbox basically.  But I have serious doubts that this is right for my <br/>\ndd.  She really resists her reading lessons. I like the curriculum <br/>\nbc my work is done for me. I just look over each lesson the day <br/>\nbefore and get the things ready that I need. And the lesson manual <br/>\ntells me just what to do.  While this makes life easy for me... it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel so right to me. I have read how many parents begin <br/>\nhomeschooling by using a curriculum. And then they figure out that <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t work for them and they turn to unschooling.  I like that <br/>\nidea but I am not there yet.  Unschooling sounds like the answer to <br/>\nme... I just don&#39;t know what we&#39;d do. Does that make sense? Everyone <br/>\nanswers that question (what do we do?) by saying &quot;whatever we <br/>\nwant.&quot;  etc.  But then I wonder how will my kids learn math and <br/>\nreading and other subjects.  I can understand that concept for <br/>\nscience.  But math?  Ok, adding, subtracting, counting, yet. But how <br/>\nwould algebra be taught or calculus?  I have _The Homeschooling <br/>\nAnswer Book_ by Linda Dobson and loved it when I read it. I have <br/>\njust recently begun t look through it again. One person in the books <br/>\nsaid something great that really opened my eyes.  Pat Montgomery <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Many homes-educating  parents bite the bait.  They accept the <br/>\nmyth that educating is about curriculum, textbooks, tests, and <br/>\nlesson plans, the trappings of institutional schools.  I submit that <br/>\nthe design of a child&#39;s education out to be about the child. What <br/>\nare his interests?  Her needs?  His capabilities?  Parents are not <br/>\nbound by the constricts of schools, which deal with such large <br/>\nnumber of students they find it easier to teach to the average <br/>\nstudents.&quot;  That really struck me. I so want to have my kids learn <br/>\nwhat they want. But for some reason I can&#39;t get it together. With 4 <br/>\nkids I often feel really bogged down.  I tend to get stressed out so <br/>\neasily and then my health is affected.  It just seems to me that a <br/>\ncurriculum is easier right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI joined this list hoping you all could help me.  I hate fighting <br/>\nwith my dd about reading.  I took her out of school bc she was <br/>\nunhappy. But how is this any better? I feel really torn.  <br/>\nAdditionally, I am super isolated. We live outside of a small town. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t get out that often bc my dh takes the car and we don&#39;t have <br/>\nthe selection of places we could go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s enough for now. This intro has turned into a vent, a plea for <br/>\nhelp, ideas.  It has gotten too long.  Thanks for reading this whole <br/>\nthing.

That I&#39;ve been doing since, oh, I guess May 24, 2001.  However, it has been a long journey coming to understand unschooling and have faith in it, a journey I&#39;m still just beginning in some ways.  Funny, because my biggest concern about it was in the area of academics at first, but now I have become quite convinced it works for that, as my 4 year old is rapidly learning to read, choosing to read phonics readers whenever the urge strikes, and repeatedly asking me out of the blue to spell things for her and what 2 and 5 are...  I&#39;m continually amazed at how much she has learned despite my &quot;failure&quot; to plan and implement structured activities.  But, it always made sense to me that just like my children learned to walk and talk when they were ready, they&#39;d also eventually be ready to read, etc.  (oh, my second daughter is starting to put words together--so cute, and one of my favorite things, language acquisition!!)
