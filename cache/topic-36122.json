Maybe it&#39;s a moderation issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to have found several online unschooling groups to be part of.  I&#39;m not sure why members of this specific group use such non-gentle language toward one another, but I&#39;m finding it difficult to continue to learn and grow from interactions on this list.  I feel sad for other readers who were attacked from every angle and had each sentence ripped to shreds.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found an environment that feels supportive for you, but I don&#39;t think this is the place for me.  Life is too short to have to deliberately separate people&#39;s angry emotions form their post to try & find the gems of wisdom and insight that are readily available on forums with a more positive focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy having my ideas challenged, but kind and nonjudgemental language is much easier to digest.
