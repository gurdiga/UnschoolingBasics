That is to say most parents who question mainstream  <br/>\neducation end up committing to Steiner schools, many of which are  <br/>\npublic (government funded).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were heavily drawn to aspects of Steiner as new parents... it  <br/>\nseemed peaceful, in touch with nature, healthy and so on. I was put  <br/>\noff by the philosophy behind Steiner (Anthroposophy) but could ignore  <br/>\nit because i enjoyed aspects of its practice. It was really our  <br/>\ndaughter who rejected it though, by the time she was four... thus  <br/>\nbegan our unschooling adventure. We have many Steiner friends and our  <br/>\nunschooling path was a very rude shock to many of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMotivated by this, I wrote an Article about unschooling that is  <br/>\ngetting published next week in the a magazine called Kindred  <br/>\n(formerly Byrons Child) which is Australia&#39;s main alternative  <br/>\nparenting magazine. The article is pitched squarely at Steiner bods  <br/>\nas they make up the mags main readership and as i say, most of the  <br/>\nalternative thinking parents in Australia...<br/>\n<br/>\nKendrah, your original post asked for links...
