How old is your child?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children never &quot;misbehave.&quot;  They behave according to their desires,<br/>\nmotivation, needs, curiosity, explorations, understanding (or naivety) and<br/>\nthe responses they get.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, when one child used to write on walls, i was quick to give her<br/>\npaper to write on indicating that these walls weren&#39;t for writing on.  I did<br/>\nput up paper on the walls so that she could write on the walls without<br/>\nruining the paint.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr - if you are referring to inappropriate social interactions i have done<br/>\nmy best not to put my child in a situation they are not developmentally<br/>\nready for, or at the very least prepare them for what is expected of them<br/>\n(eg. quiet in the library).  But if when my young child was biting or<br/>\nhitting or yelling at another, it was usually because the situation was not<br/>\nthe right one for my child and/or they were not being respected.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my younger dd was 5yo she went under a table at a restaurant with my<br/>\nmom and wouldn&#39;t come out.

My dd has not been left with my mom since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never found my child to &quot;misbehave&quot; with intention of hurting or<br/>\ndamaging another person or object without provocation.

It has been a step-by-step process. He has always been<br/>\ninterested in what anyone is doing. Me, his father, his Nana or when I take<br/>\nhim to where his Aunt lives (at an Intentional Community called Wygelia) and<br/>\nI have dealt with my battles of he is not too young to help and turn it<br/>\naround to in what way, no matter the task can he help.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe even helps someone build a fire by carrying fire wood (one piece at a<br/>\ntime), looking for kindling and blowing on the spark. While I do admit that<br/>\nsome times I make it sound that a lot of it comes from me. His desire to<br/>\nhelp has built over time to him doing these things. I didn&#39;t just throw<br/>\ndetergent at him and tell him to go clean the mess up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the same steps to clean anything up from toys to a building project.<br/>\nIf he says a job is too big then we break it down together. We pick the big<br/>\npieces first, the smaller pieces next, wipe up or vacuum whatever is left<br/>\nbehind. It has slowly over a very long time to get to the point of him doing<br/>\nthese things on him own.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes to help out and he likes almost any job that he can play in water;<br/>\nwashing the dishes, spot treating laundry and cleaning the floor. Does he do<br/>\nit all the time? No! He does it when it strikes him to do it or a big mess<br/>\nis made or he finds himself washing his hands at the sink and sees that<br/>\nthere are a couple things in the prespot bucket that we moved upstairs<br/>\nbecause he expressed wanting to do it and it has made it more convenient for<br/>\nus all because I will do one when I am washing my hands or my husband will<br/>\nand me doing will spike his interest - &quot;But Mama I wanted to do those!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of us have a chore list. We all do whatever needs done as it needs done<br/>\nwhen it needs done. Sometimes it does get forgotten and eventually we may<br/>\nneed a better method. I don&#39;t expect him to do more then he expects of<br/>\nhimself. When he was very young it was Opps! You spilled some milk or<br/>\nwhatever. Let&#39;s clean it up! Messes don&#39;t bother me - except vomit which I<br/>\njust can&#39;t do.
