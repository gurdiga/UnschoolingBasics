We pick up a few things during the big sales, but we try to<br/>\nhold off until the second week after school starts when they mark<br/>\neverything down even further.  I jumped on Crayola markers being on<br/>\nsale for 88¢ this week at Target! I also bought a 10 pack of spiral<br/>\nnotebooks as the kids go through those things like crazy with notes,<br/>\nplays, drawings, games, doodling, crumpled ball cat toys :-)  When I<br/>\ncame in the door with this huge bag of &quot;school supplies&quot; Mary Elayne<br/>\n(almost 11) decided to become melodramatic screaming, &quot;NO NO NO YOU<br/>\nWON&#39;T SEND ME BACK TO SCHOOL!  I&#39;D RATHER DIE FIRST!  I&#39;M DYING! I&#39;M<br/>\nDYING! I&#39;M DYING!&quot;  ROFL.  Then today we were at the grocery store and<br/>\nthere was a display of lunch boxes and she said, &quot;Mommy, save me from<br/>\nthe school lunch boxes.  Please tell me you aren&#39;t going to buy one<br/>\nand send me to school!&quot;  I laughed and said, &quot;Why would I want to send<br/>\nyou to school?  No fear there!&quot;  Of course that got some very odd<br/>\nlooks from the stockboy ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223344266,"authorName":"Christy Putnam","from":"&quot;Christy Putnam&quot; &lt;personal_balance@...&gt;","profile":"personal_balance","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Target $1 Section FYI","postDate":"1153168653","msgId":15811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZmIwMWM2YTllMCRkNThhN2ZmMCQ2NTAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15812,"prevInTime":15810,"nextInTime":15812,"topicId":15811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"FYI - Target s $1 section has some great back to school stuff!
