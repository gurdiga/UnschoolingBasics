Today was a nicer day here in IL so he went out to  play!  Was digging <br/>\nin the yard for bones (daddy wasn&#39;t so much thinking  this was a good idea but <br/>\nshh daddy wasn&#39;t home).  After about an hr doing  this he comes running into <br/>\nthe house SO EXCITED he had found some bones (Holy  Crap eww mom was thinking <br/>\ncause im pretty sure it was the jaw of a kitty)   anyhow he pulls out all his <br/>\nbooks and flys through them to find out what kind  they are.  Moms vote is for <br/>\na plant eating flying kind.  Jacob on the  other hand is convinced he has <br/>\ndiscovered Trex bones.  This was just so  exciting to me as the middle of last yr <br/>\nwhen we pulled him out of school he was  so traumatizes (teacher had labeled <br/>\nthe 2 jacobs the good jacob and the bad  jacob... my amazingly energitic baby <br/>\nwas the bad jacob) that I feared hed ever  be excited like this again!!  So <br/>\ntoday was a good day!!<br/>\n <br/>\nChrissy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10113,"nextTopicId":10153}}
