In the alternative community of which I&#39;m a part, we talk about that in terms of &quot;drag&quot; (think Drag Queen). Nature is naked, and everything else is drag, as the saying goes. So your girl can have home drag, grandma&#39;s house drag, going to the playground drag, going to church drag... Do you see what I mean?

Her curls hang in her face, i think its cute and she doesn&#39;t mind at all, in fact if i suggest a hairclip or a ponytail she refuses the offer; she wipes her hands trough the curls, out of her face and tell&#39;s me that works just fine. I love it, it&#39;s so who she is. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT....ah, the mother in law ;) She want&#39;s her to be a real girly-girl even though she&#39;s a tomboy. Every time she went over there she comes back with perfect girly hair; clips, pins, ponytails..... It&#39;s cute but so not her so to be honest it annoys me to bits. A couple of days she picked her up for a sleepover and my mother-in-law told me what to pack; that one girly dress (she doesn&#39;t like to wear) and a couple of hairpins. If i don&#39;t, she end&#39;s up buying new stuff like that every time she&#39;s there..<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is; my girl doesn&#39;t like her hair brushed and i&#39;m fine with that, the curls are cute anyway and it takes 3 days to mess them up, by then it&#39;s time to wash it again. No problem.<br/>\nNo pins, ponytails or girly-girl dresses if she doesn&#39;t want to. But how do i react to the pushing my MIL does? Now i just let her, thinking oh well, it&#39;s a grandma thing and my daughter knowsit. But it&#39;s quite stupid when i think about it, why should my daughter be a totally different kid when she is there, just because grandma likes to dress her up and show her off...?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thought or advices?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKlasina<br/>\nNova (march &#39;07)   Lou (march &#39;10)<br/>\nwww.zoalspippi.wordpress.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45987,"nextTopicId":45981}}
