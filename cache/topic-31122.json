After a short<br/>\ndiscussion on where it went, he asked me to get another one even<br/>\nthough he acknowledged he&#39;d tire of it quickly. After talking, this<br/>\nis what i learned from him today:<br/>\n<br/>\n- he thinks school kids must be smarter because they go to school to<br/>\nlearn all day. :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n- he wants to learn math in a &quot;normal&quot; because he feels he isn&#39;t<br/>\nlearning enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gather one of the reasons he thinks that school kids &quot;must be<br/>\nsmarter&quot; is that he tends to be around public schoolers a lot more<br/>\nthan homeschoolers. His activities and sports are dominated by school<br/>\nkids. He has no interest in going to school but for some reason he<br/>\nfeels he isn&#39;t measuring up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked for a little while and I pointed out that all the cooking,<br/>\nand shopping, Runescape, and a few other daily things we do all<br/>\ninclude math, but it didn&#39;t seem good enough for him. He thinks maybe<br/>\na workbook would help. And he says he does not want to learn math<br/>\nfrom a computer. (I had pointed out all the math he does playing<br/>\ncomputer games)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m being too vague, if so please feel free to ask me questions.<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m not sure where to go next. I&#39;d like to help him feel<br/>\nbetter, but I&#39;m a little stuck. I&#39;d like to get him the workbook he<br/>\nwants, and I most likely will, but I have a hunch that after the<br/>\nworkbook novelty wears off we&#39;ll be right back to this problem, as its<br/>\nnot the first time he is bringing it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!

I&#39;m new to these boards and am no  <br/>\nexpert, but it seems that the philosophy of unschooling is to trust  <br/>\nwhatever our children are interested in and to go with it (unless  <br/>\nit&#39;s jumping off a 500-foot-high cliff into jagged rocks below,  <br/>\nwithout a parachute).

Months  <br/>\nlater, she had one burning, relentless desire: to go to public  <br/>\nschool. Her mom resisted for a long time but eventually gave in  <br/>\nbecause, she said, she realized she was being conditional with a  <br/>\nphilosophy that was, at its core, unconditional. Bee went to school  <br/>\nand LOVED it--she says she loved the structure, the workbooks, the  <br/>\npredictability, the assignments, the homework, and all that stuff  <br/>\nthat I personally HATED when I went to school. To this day Bee thanks  <br/>\nher mom, and her mom says, half-jokingly, &quot;Well, we unschooled when  <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t in school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not telling this story because I think your son&#39;s interest in  <br/>\nworkbooks will lead to a serious desire to go to school.

Done that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron felt the same way. I contacted Pam Sorooshian about some books <br/>\nthat might make him feel better---&#39;cause, well, that&#39;s what he asked <br/>\nfor. But Cam was 18-ish, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath for Dummies, All the Math You&#39;ll Ever Need---and one more, but I <br/>\ncan&#39;t remember its name. I&#39;ve heard The Math Devil is fun, but we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe went through two of them, did several of the problems and realized <br/>\nthat he&#39;s just fine. &lt;g&gt; He made plenty of mistakes; but after looking <br/>\nat the answers, he knew where he went wrong. It helped him understand <br/>\nsome concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Cam, it was more about reassuring himself, I think. As soon as he <br/>\nwas satisfied, it became a non-issue again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a much bigger deal when he was younger. At 13, 14, and 15, he <br/>\nreally thought he was stupid---and would always be stupid because he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;do math&quot; and because I didn&#39;t make him read. I asked whether he <br/>\nthought doing math worksheets would make him smarter. He said no. &lt;g&gt; I <br/>\nasked whether he thought he would like to read more if I made him. He <br/>\nsaid no. &lt;g&gt; I also (as you did) told him all the different ways he WAS <br/>\nbeing exposed to math. That wasn&#39;t the same to him either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was important to me that he not think that school learning was the <br/>\nbest/only way to learn. But I&#39;d done plenty of damage when he was <br/>\nyounger by telling him that school was his &quot;job&quot; and all that. Plus, he <br/>\nhad all his schooled friends who were always busy &quot;studying.&quot; How could <br/>\nhe ever be as smart &#39;cause all *he* did all day was play? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took time. It&#39;s been really good for him to see Duncan&#39;s progress <br/>\nwithOUT school. He also knows NOW that he has his entire life to learn <br/>\nWHATEVER he wants to. He knows NOW that he&#39;s a passionate learner. <br/>\nDidn&#39;t help his teen years though! Just so much comparing that goes on <br/>\nin those years! He&#39;s come out the other side very confident that he CAN <br/>\nlearn though---and that&#39;s *wonderful* for me to see! (Him too, I guess! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot stress enough how empowering an unschooling conference can be <br/>\nfor him as well as you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing---and becoming friends with---other unschoolers shows them that <br/>\nthey are not always &quot;on the outside.&quot; He can meet older unschoolers who <br/>\nhave never had a &quot;math lesson&quot;---and he&#39;ll see that, not only has it <br/>\nnot held them back, they are amazingly smart and comfortable with Who <br/>\nThey Are.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry, try, TRY to get to one, if at all possible.
