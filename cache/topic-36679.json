Anyone else<br/>\n </span></blockquote>have this experience?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Dina<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, Dina, my son completely avoided playgrounds and groups of young<br/>\nkids from 2 years old until he was almost five. I was surprised when I<br/>\nrealized he found most kids his age too noisy and unpredictable to<br/>\nenjoy their company. He preferred playing with me or my husband for<br/>\nmost of those early years, or with one carefully chosen friend at a<br/>\ntime. And yet I never really thought of it as a &quot;problem&quot; until I<br/>\nstarted hearing it from other parents and, later on, from school and<br/>\nthe experts within. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately for my son, that was the beginning of me eventually<br/>\nlearning to see him as a big long string of social and learning<br/>\ndisabilities. &quot;The first warning signs&quot;, some said. To keep a long<br/>\nstory short, that perspective was not at all helpful for me or my son.<br/>\nThankfully and with the help of this group I am now working on<br/>\nreversing that damage, but I spent lot of time trying to figure out<br/>\nwhat was wrong with him instead of accepting and helping him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy now 9 year old son still finds many kids are emotionally and<br/>\nphysically rougher than he likes and often initially avoids new groups<br/>\nuntil he has had a chance to watch them operate, but he has learned to<br/>\nexpect and plan for this more now.  He likes to play pretend games<br/>\nsuch as Army or Dinosaur Hunters, which can take a rough turn quickly,<br/>\nso he generally &quot;runs&quot; these games to keep the action to an acceptable<br/>\nlevel, which takes it own unique set of social skills.  He continues<br/>\nto choose his friends very carefully and avoids kids who won&#39;t allow<br/>\nfor his playing style. It still takes him a long time to judge whether<br/>\na social situation feels safe to jump into or not. He is sometimes the<br/>\nleader, sometimes the one sitting out. No problem. Now that we&#39;re out<br/>\nof school, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also choose my friends carefully, spend a lot of time by myself, and<br/>\navoid certain types of people altogether. It drives me crazy when<br/>\nsomeone tells me I should socialize more. Why I was ever sad about my<br/>\nson doing the same things probably had more to do with that Kodak<br/>\nmoment in my head about him than anything real in our lives.<br/>\n  <br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263835726,"authorName":"Dina","from":"&quot;Dina&quot; &lt;dapsign@...&gt;","profile":"dapsign","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"2 year old seems afraid of young kids","postDate":"1224729934","msgId":36679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdkb29nZStpN2g3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36729,"prevInTime":36678,"nextInTime":36680,"topicId":36679,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Since someone mentioned that the traffic here has been a bit slow I thought I would go ahead and post a concern...

We went to a Halloween party today and he <br/>\nkept guiding me to the door.  So we left.  Maybe the costumes freaked him out.  Who knows.  <br/>\nBut this &quot;fear&quot; seems to come and go.  We were on a 5 hour flight last month where he <br/>\nscreamed every time he heard a baby make a sound from the row in front of us.  Unexpected <br/>\nsounds seem to scare him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, he was fine at the playground yesterday (played ball with other kids) and <br/>\nwhen we&#39;re out and about.  He loves adults and will make eye contact and point and sign to <br/>\nthem (he&#39;s not very verbal just yet). I know he&#39;s really young and that I need to support him <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s scared but sometimes I feel sad that he doesn&#39;t want to be around other kids.  <br/>\nProbably because I usually want to chat with the other moms, who I have a lot in common <br/>\nwith - and that seems rare around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?  Anyone else have this experience?<br/>\n<br/>\nDina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36658,"nextTopicId":36711}}
