Also, I had a LONG email discussion with them some years ago and the upshot was that unless you are &quot;doing school&quot; you may or may not be covered if something comes up. They have a very schooled mindset and unschooling is not something they&#39;re going to handle most of the time. Sure, they&#39;ll answer questions if you ask, and sometimes I&#39;ll hit their website to do a quick check on statute information (they do show the actual statute references for all states so it makes looking things up easier) but they tend to want more than the actual minimum the law requires. For instance, in CT, there is no paperwork requirement at all (once your child is withdrawn from the roll books) BUT they &quot;prefer&quot; that everyone file the optional Notice of Intent form, which includes agreeing to a portfolio review. It&#39;s not required legally but if you don&#39;t do it, they might not &quot;be able&quot; to support you should anything arise. That&#39;s right from them (but it was a decade ago so I don&#39;t still have the email thread).<br/>\n<br/>\n--DebR<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

He is heavily involved in politics and the Christian groups responsible for the Christian agenda getting entwined in the Republican party. He founded Patrick Henry College, partially funded by HSLDA dues before enough homeschoolers objected. The college was founded to train fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers in politics. HSLDA headquarters is on the Patrick Henry campus. Here&#39;s a bit from Wikipedia:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; All students must sign a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; before they arrive, affirming belief in what the college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, students are asked to acknowledge &quot;Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity&quot;, and &quot;Christ&#39;s death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins.&quot; The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Teaching faculty must also sign the &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;, plus a more detailed &quot;Statement of Biblical Worldview&quot;, which represents the college&#39;s requirements for what should be taught. For example the Biblical Worldview Applications states that, &quot;Any biology, Bible, or other courses at PHC dealing with creation will teach creation from the understanding of Scripture that God&#39;s creative work, as described in Genesis 1:1�31, was completed in six twenty-four-hour days.&quot; New Scientist has claimed that Patrick Henry College and the homeschooling community in general were &quot;possibly threatening the public school system that has fought hard against imposing a Christian viewpoint on science teaching.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; In an interview with Fresh Air on National Public Radio, PHC founder Michael Farris commented that the college held the view that its faith was the only true faith (&quot;We believe that there is truth and there is error.&quot;), and he expressed disapproval of religious and social toleration. &quot;Tolerance cannot coexist with liberty&quot; because &quot;the crowd of tolerance wants to ban speech.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Political views<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Patrick Henry College has been criticized for what some see as extreme conservatism and evangelical Christian ethos, including creationism, by many newspapers such as theNew Zealand Herald and New Scientist. The school has also been criticized for an alleged Republican bias. Janet Ashcroft, wife of John Ashcroft, serves on the Board of Trustees. This has prompted the British newspaper The Independent to dub Patrick Henry College &quot;The Bible College That Leads to the White House.&quot; The German newspaper Die Zeit criticised the college of influencing the niches with their own values and undercutting the society.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This should take you to a Google Translated copy of the article from De Zeit:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goo.gl/SL1g7\">http://goo.gl/SL1g7</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s a Reconstructionist.

This is the wider trend to which some critics refer, generally, as Dominionism. They also allegedly have influence disproportionate to their numbers among the advocates of the growth of the Christian homeschooling and other Christian education movements that seek independence from the direct oversight or support of the civil government.

It&#39;s generally easier, when dealing with the legalities, to put &quot;unschooling&quot; in terms which are comfortable and friendly to the people you&#39;re dealing with. If you (general you, not specific) are in the position of needing to describe a &quot;curriculum&quot; or learning plan, heres a page with some samples of what others have done and some links to useful resources:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s listed there, but when Ray was still unschooling (he&#39;s 19), he was registered with an &quot;umbrella school&quot; which was unschooling-friendly but did require a semi-annual &quot;learning plan&quot;. What I did - and later his bio mom took over - was to list what he had been doing for the Last six months as his &quot;learning plan&quot; for the next. That way I wasn&#39;t guessing the future and he always &quot;met his goals&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on where you live, though, it could be easier to opt for some kind of regular testing. I know that might sound counter-intuitive, but in some places nothing happens with the test results - nothing! And even in places where there&#39;s some kind of assessment you may be able to self-administer the test and look up answers. This is why it&#39;s important to connect with other homeschoolers in your area! They&#39;ll know what&#39;s least intrusive. And don&#39;t hesitate to check with radical Christian homeschoolers, even if you&#39;re not homeschooling for religious reasons - they Often know the Least intrusive reporting option and can be a useful source of information in that regard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; these forms are intrusive and fear based to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The forms themselves are just pieces of paper ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re expending way more energy fighting the system than you would filling out a few pieces of paper and putting them in the mail. That&#39;s one of the common results of living with a lot of rules and limits - you end up investing an amazing amount of personal energy in resisting or fighting or struggling to claim some kind of sense of self. It&#39;s an important idea to carry into your relationship with your child, because to your child You&#39;re &quot;the System&quot; - you&#39;re the one who has the ability to set rules and limits, and it&#39;s possible to create exactly the same kind of dynamic at home that you&#39;re fighting against wrt the school. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo whatever gets the Powers That Be off your back the soonest - that will make your life at home with your child more peaceful and let you focus on what&#39;s important. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] feedback","postDate":"1358908497","msgId":49433,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDOUMwRUZFLTA0OTYtNDA5NS1BRkVGLUE5NEI1NzFERjVGM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlDRjRFQTA1LTA5NkUtNDU3MS1BMzVELUY2NkY5RTcwMkU2RUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGJhZC4xMjcwNDNhYS4zZTMwMjU2N0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8Q0FGRm5ESzRFc2NuZDJLZSs5WTRET09IeHA5T1RIa1duK2NaVGE5N0tiVU1kVFlFdDhBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8RUZGNTE3N0MtRTc3NS00MTM0LThBQ0MtNEM1OERGOTI2M0U4QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDdCNTYxQzkxLUI5RjItNDM5RC05RUE3LUIxQjUxQ0JEOEQ3QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4gPDlDRjRFQTA1LTA5NkUtNDU3MS1BMzVELUY2NkY5RTcwMkU2RUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49432,"nextInTopic":49434,"prevInTime":49432,"nextInTime":49434,"topicId":49414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They won&#39;t take on a case if they believe it will interfere with what they believe is best for their particular flavor of Christian fundamentalist homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a wealth of information about HSLDA:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hsislegal.com\">http://hsislegal.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is absolutely no reason a homeschoolers needs HSLDA. There are plenty of other ways to get help that don&#39;t involve their politics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe founder and head of HSLDA is Michael Farris. He is heavily involved in politics and the Christian groups responsible for the Christian agenda getting entwined in the Republican party. He founded Patrick Henry College, partially funded by HSLDA dues before enough homeschoolers objected. The college was founded to train fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers in politics. HSLDA headquarters is on the Patrick Henry campus. Here&#39;s a bit from Wikipedia:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All students must sign a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; before they arrive, affirming belief in what the college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, students are asked to acknowledge &quot;Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity&quot;, and &quot;Christ&#39;s death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins.&quot; The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Teaching faculty must also sign the &quot;Statement of Faith&quot;, plus a more detailed &quot;Statement of Biblical Worldview&quot;, which represents the college&#39;s requirements for what should be taught. For example the Biblical Worldview Applications states that, &quot;Any biology, Bible, or other courses at PHC dealing with creation will teach creation from the understanding of Scripture that God&#39;s creative work, as described in Genesis 1:1�31, was completed in six twenty-four-hour days.&quot; New Scientist has claimed that Patrick Henry College and the homeschooling community in general were &quot;possibly threatening the public school system that has fought hard against imposing a Christian viewpoint on science teaching.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In an interview with Fresh Air on National Public Radio, PHC founder Michael Farris commented that the college held the view that its faith was the only true faith (&quot;We believe that there is truth and there is error.&quot;), and he expressed disapproval of religious and social toleration. &quot;Tolerance cannot coexist with liberty&quot; because &quot;the crowd of tolerance wants to ban speech.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Political views<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Patrick Henry College has been criticized for what some see as extreme conservatism and evangelical Christian ethos, including creationism, by many newspapers such as theNew Zealand Herald and New Scientist. The school has also been criticized for an alleged Republican bias. Janet Ashcroft, wife of John Ashcroft, serves on the Board of Trustees. This has prompted the British newspaper The Independent to dub Patrick Henry College &quot;The Bible College That Leads to the White House.&quot; The German newspaper Die Zeit criticised the college of influencing the niches with their own values and undercutting the society.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This should take you to a Google Translated copy of the article from De Zeit:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goo.gl/SL1g7\">http://goo.gl/SL1g7</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a Reconstructionist.

This is the wider trend to which some critics refer, generally, as Dominionism. They also allegedly have influence disproportionate to their numbers among the advocates of the growth of the Christian homeschooling and other Christian education movements that seek independence from the direct oversight or support of the civil government. Because their numbers are so small compared to their influence, they are sometimes accused of being secretive and conspiratorial.They deny this, noting they have published thousands of newsletters and hundreds of books.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless you&#39;re a Reconstructionist, there are plenty of better ways to spend your money.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":438157381,"authorName":"Jo-Anna Brereton","from":"Jo-Anna Brereton &lt;movingonout2009@...&gt;","profile":"movingonout2009","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: feedback","postDate":"1358906206","msgId":49431,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTAtU01UUDM2M0YxOTQ0NDg1RkIzODYxRjg1MjkyQkYxNTBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":49430,"nextInTopic":49432,"prevInTime":49430,"nextInTime":49432,"topicId":49414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I recently moved my my family from Kitchener to Newfoundland, and I have got o say, it was waaaaaaay easier in Kitchener.

At that point they pretty much wash their hands of you, as you state that you accept full responsibility for your childs education.  They do not butt into how you homeschool, they do not care.

The cant ask you to do more then that unless they are given significant reason to do, and have no legal right otherwise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn Ontario it is mostly provincial rules, and a lot of the actual schools have no idea what they are and are not allowed to do.

Those have been some of my &quot;so there!&quot; moments - no, my kid didn&#39;t need to suffer under a beauracracy to know how to deal with one, not at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":482623530,"authorName":"Lesley Cross","from":"Lesley Cross &lt;lesleycross@...&gt;","profile":"decldc1992","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: feedback","postDate":"1358899311","msgId":49428,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyQTUzQTEwLTZBMEYtNDFCQy05OTc0LUIzQ0ZBREMzNTQ1N0BhdHQubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTg4OTQyNDMuMzgyLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxMjYxMDYubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzNTg4NzE5OTkuMzg4MjQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxrZG1rNjErMTVxdkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDEzNTg4OTI4MzAuMzQ4NTAuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw4Q0ZDNzA3RkU2MjREQkQtMTA0OC0yQkFCNEB3ZWJtYWlsLWQxODkuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+IDwxMzU4ODk0MjQzLjM4Mi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTI2MTA2Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49427,"nextInTopic":49429,"prevInTime":49427,"nextInTime":49429,"topicId":49414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When it comes down to it legally, what you find necessary is not relevant.

It&#39;s generally easier, when dealing with the legalities, to put &quot;unschooling&quot; in terms which are comfortable and friendly to the people you&#39;re dealing with. If you (general you, not specific) are in the position of needing to describe a &quot;curriculum&quot; or learning plan, heres a page with some samples of what others have done and some links to useful resources:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s listed there, but when Ray was still unschooling (he&#39;s 19), he was registered with an &quot;umbrella school&quot; which was unschooling-friendly but did require a semi-annual &quot;learning plan&quot;. What I did - and later his bio mom took over - was to list what he had been doing for the Last six months as his &quot;learning plan&quot; for the next. That way I wasn&#39;t guessing the future and he always &quot;met his goals&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on where you live, though, it could be easier to opt for some kind of regular testing. I know that might sound counter-intuitive, but in some places nothing happens with the test results - nothing! And even in places where there&#39;s some kind of assessment you may be able to self-administer the test and look up answers. This is why it&#39;s important to connect with other homeschoolers in your area! They&#39;ll know what&#39;s least intrusive. And don&#39;t hesitate to check with radical Christian homeschoolers, even if you&#39;re not homeschooling for religious reasons - they Often know the Least intrusive reporting option and can be a useful source of information in that regard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; these forms are intrusive and fear based to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The forms themselves are just pieces of paper ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re expending way more energy fighting the system than you would filling out a few pieces of paper and putting them in the mail. That&#39;s one of the common results of living with a lot of rules and limits - you end up investing an amazing amount of personal energy in resisting or fighting or struggling to claim some kind of sense of self. It&#39;s an important idea to carry into your relationship with your child, because to your child You&#39;re &quot;the System&quot; - you&#39;re the one who has the ability to set rules and limits, and it&#39;s possible to create exactly the same kind of dynamic at home that you&#39;re fighting against wrt the school. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo whatever gets the Powers That Be off your back the soonest - that will make your life at home with your child more peaceful and let you focus on what&#39;s important. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":475045201,"authorName":"Mandy Taylor","from":"Mandy Taylor &lt;msmandytaylor@...&gt;","profile":"msmandytaylor","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] feedback","postDate":"1358894973","msgId":49430,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlDRjRFQTA1LTA5NkUtNDU3MS1BMzVELUY2NkY5RTcwMkU2RUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCNTYxQzkxLUI5RjItNDM5RC05RUE3LUIxQjUxQ0JEOEQ3QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGJhZC4xMjcwNDNhYS4zZTMwMjU2N0Bhb2wuY29tPiA8Q0FGRm5ESzRFc2NuZDJLZSs5WTRET09IeHA5T1RIa1duK2NaVGE5N0tiVU1kVFlFdDhBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8RUZGNTE3N0MtRTc3NS00MTM0LThBQ0MtNEM1OERGOTI2M0U4QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDdCNTYxQzkxLUI5RjItNDM5RC05RUE3LUIxQjUxQ0JEOEQ3QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":49429,"nextInTopic":49431,"prevInTime":49429,"nextInTime":49431,"topicId":49414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Joyce, Can you send me a few links with show HSLDA will not help if you are not Christian?

It takes awhile to get your feet under you, so don&#39;t worry if you feel lost at first. The most important thing for you to do in terms of legalities and procedures is to do some research. You need to know the law for your state/province/territory And you need to know the ways other homeschoolers deal with that law - what the important loopholes are - so you don&#39;t make more work for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good, general website to start researching home-ed is A to Z&#39;s Home&#39;s Cool:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/\">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a huge site with a ton of information. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; my son is 6 years of age and because he was in school system, the school and the school board require that i fill out paper work<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nChances are what the School needs is some kind of notice that you&#39;ve withdrawn your child from that school - where I live it&#39;s a &quot;transfer&quot; form, as though we were moving from one school to another. Otherwise, the school is obligated to report your child as truant. That&#39;s not a small charge - in some places it&#39;s grounds to be investigated by Child Services... because some parents keep kids out of school to hide evidence of abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing to find out is how long you have to submit the withdrawal forms - often it&#39;s something like 30 days, but Look it Up! Depending on where you live, there may be other paperwork to submit along with the withdrawal form - but that varies really widely And depends on the local loopholes. If you&#39;re going to register as a homeschooler, you may need to submit some kind of learning plan - but if you have the option of using an umbrella program or charter, or declaring yourself a private school then that won&#39;t apply to you because technically you won&#39;t Be a homeschooler, even though you&#39;ll be homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nConfused yet? This is why it&#39;s important to know they law And contact local homeschoolers to find out what they do. Many homeschoolers in the US, for instance, are registered as belonging to some kind of private school and so the homeschool laws don&#39;t apply. It&#39;s a Big, useful loophole! But it&#39;s not available everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and i wonder if unschooling is recognized by the school board too?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a kind of homeschooling as far as The Powers That Be are concerned. Don&#39;t give them one jot more information than you have to! Also, don&#39;t ask the school board anything about homeschooling other than &quot;are the forms online or do I get them from you?&quot;. School professionals generally know little to nothing about homeschooling and will misinform you - maybe innocently, maybe in an attempt to intimidate you. If you need to deal with school board professionals directly, get some advice from other homeschoolers in your area first, so you know what to say, and to whom. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome homeschoolers do go the route of civil disobedience by refusing to submit annual reports or whatever. That might be an option for you at some point, but maybe not right now. You Do need to reassure the local authorities that you&#39;re not a neglectful, abusive parent who is keeping your child out of school to hide what you&#39;re doing at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547850347,"authorName":"mgroom85","from":"&quot;mgroom85&quot; &lt;meghorvath85@...&gt;","profile":"mgroom85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: feedback","postDate":"1358877697","msgId":49418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtkbWs2MSsxNXF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTg4NzE5OTkuMzg4MjQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNjEwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49417,"nextInTopic":49419,"prevInTime":49417,"nextInTime":49419,"topicId":49414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, Sometimes school officials can make you feel like you re not making a smart choice, by choosing to homeschool, especially after your child has already","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-379424449\">Hey,<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes school officials can make you feel like you&#39;re not making a &#39;smart&#39; choice, by choosing to homeschool, especially after your child has already been in a school system.

It always takes longer than I want it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo it a step at a time. Each hour do one thing. Get an envelope. Put the address on it. Put a stamp on it. Fill in your name on the paper work. And so on. If you feel like doing more than one step, go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDealing with a truant officer is going to be WAY more of a pain than paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and i wonder if unschooling is recognized by the school board too?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t mention unschooling. For legal purposes you&#39;re homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind your state homeschooling or unschooling list. Ask them about how to present unschooling to them. Or search the archives at their list. It&#39;s undoubtedly a question that&#39;s been asked a hundred times.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a good place to start.
