We&#39;re in California, and with the current question about the hoops<br/>\none will need to jump through to homeschool here, I&#39;m so far deciding to<br/>\nstay with the charter.  They cover me legally, give us funds for tons of<br/>\nresources, and our charter is quite easy to work with for unschoolers.  You<br/>\ndo have to submit attendance charts and a monthly chart of what was covered<br/>\nfor each subject.  Most months are so easy - I just leave the chart on the<br/>\nfridge and when anything comes up that could feasibly fit under a category<br/>\n(and usually under several!) I jot it down.  We turn in portfolio samples<br/>\nfour times a year, and my Educational Specialist (teacher we&#39;re assigned to)<br/>\naccepts just about anything; photos, drawings, craft samples, blog entries,<br/>\netc.  The biggest stickler for me is the annual STAR testing each year<br/>\n(California test for all public schooled kids).  However, with the way the<br/>\nlaw may be swinging out here, I&#39;m guessing that might be a requirement for<br/>\nall homeschoolers anyway when all is said and done.  So we&#39;re hanging with<br/>\nthe charter for now.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut I hear ya on the wavering - there are definitely some weeks where I<br/>\nstress that we haven&#39;t written down anything or history or science or (fill<br/>\nin the blank)!  But it usually resolves itself in a few days.  When it gets<br/>\nreally tough, our ES is very helpful in brainstorming things we might have<br/>\ndone that will fill in the chart.  I definitely think having her on our<br/>\n&quot;team&quot; makes it much easier.  I can see that with a stricter ES - or one who<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; unschooling - it would be more of a challenge.<br/>\n <br/>\nShell & Da Boys<br/>\nDrew, 8.5 and Josh, 4.5<br/>\nwww.thedaker.blogspot.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thedaker.blogspot.com/\">http://www.thedaker.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you <br/>\nlove, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot; John Irving<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of shannikki1<br/>\nSent: Saturday, March 29, 2008 12:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] I&#39;m resenting my sons charter school, what now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, my thinking is far from clear, I could use some help with this one!<br/>\nMy son is enrolled in a charter school.
