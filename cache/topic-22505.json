I think that all of us have a tendency to freak <br/>\nout a bit about changes, it&#39;s a hard thing to accept, that nothing, <br/>\n*nothing* stays the same. I like to talk to my kids about changes on <br/>\na molecular level, the way that every time we drive our car some <br/>\ntiny bits of the tire stay on the road, and so even though it&#39;s <br/>\nstill a tire, it&#39;s different, and the road is different, and when <br/>\nyou eat food, it makes the cells in your body, and so those cells <br/>\nare different, and the cells your sheets make your sheets <br/>\ndifferent....<br/>\nWe like to point out to eachother all the ways every single thing is <br/>\ndifferent every moment. And it&#39;s exciting. We went to a mandala <br/>\nmaking by a group of Tibetan Monks last summer, and really got on a <br/>\nkick about how wonderful it is that everything changes all the time. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a really peaceful feeling to just *know* that in your soul. <br/>\nMaybe your 5yo would enjoy a table top zen garden?

She is only beginning to realizes that she<br/>\ncan choose and her choices will be honored. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It was such a relief to all of us when Ray&#39;s mom finally said okay <br/>\n&gt; to homeschooling.

I have to allow<br/>\nher to truly chose for herself, that is soooo hard for me.  I think<br/>\nthis new experience with living here and having so much<br/>\nfreedom...phone, friends, computer, My Space, ears pieced, food<br/>\nchoices, clothing *she* likes, etc., will help her see that she can be<br/>\nherself and be loved, not valued by her GPA.<br/>\n    It also makes sense that 5yo would be scared of being sent to<br/>\nschool.  She doesn&#39;t like to be away from me for very long. Dh and I<br/>\nhave tried to have a date night where 5yo spends the night at grandmas<br/>\n(5yo&#39;s idea) but I have picked her up 2 out of 3 times :) and the 3rd<br/>\ntime I picked her up really early in the morning, and 5yo and her<br/>\ngrandma have a very close relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if she&#39;s not worried about <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; something like that, having a new housemate is a BIG life change - <br/>\n&gt; having one with these weird scheduling, clothing, food, and work <br/>\n&gt; requirements is a big topsy-turvey change. *I* felt like school was <br/>\n&gt; ruining our life - your 5yo could easily feel the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, we have had to deal with lots of homework and why can&#39;t 15yo<br/>\nplay now and Parent teacher conferences (I promised 15yo that I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t tell her teachers what I really thought).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; How do I keep 5yo from overshadowing 15yo (from experience <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that 5yo personality is to keep pushing and 15yo has not <br/>\n&gt; &gt; learned how to ask for or get what she needs) when it comes to <br/>\n&gt; time <br/>\n&gt; &gt; with me. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find it helps *me* to avoid thinking of the kids needs as being in <br/>\n&gt; competition with each other: Every person in my family is important <br/>\n&gt; to me. My stepson also has learned to be somewhat retiring wrt his <br/>\n&gt; needs, so I make an effort to meet those needs proactively. That <br/>\n&gt; helps him feel important and special even with a high-energy 5yo <br/>\n&gt; bouncing all over the place. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am learning this. I think it&#39;s something like the expansion theory<br/>\nwhere everyones needs can be met at the same time rather than only one<br/>\nperson at a time. Things are calming down a bit as time goes on. At<br/>\nfirst 5yo would grab my arm and try to take me away from 15yo and talk<br/>\nover 15yo when we were trying to have a conversation.

She won&#39;t compromise when you say  <br/>\n&quot;Hey, I need to do this!&quot; because she knows once your attention  <br/>\nshifts away, she&#39;s very likely lost the opportunity to get what she  <br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe realistic about your needs. A need for 3 hours of alone time a day  <br/>\njust isn&#39;t going to happen with a 5 yo ;-) (I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re  <br/>\ndoing that. It&#39;s just an extreme example. We should carve out time to  <br/>\nmeet our needs, but we need to be reasonable about what we can and  <br/>\ncan&#39;t achieve when we have kids.

When we first began our Unschooling <br/>\njourney, I was so all about meeting their needs and making sure <br/>\ntheir feelings were acknowledged and validated, I forgot that I had <br/>\nfeelings and needs, and that those were *just as* important as the <br/>\nchildren&#39;s feelings, and I still forget, sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, 8yo ds, is here full time, and 4yo ds is gone on <br/>\nweekends, at which time 8yo and I have a thoroughly &quot;us&quot; two days. <br/>\nIt&#39;s really hard for him to switch gears, and he will say things <br/>\nlike &quot;I hate you&quot; to 4yo. At which time, I confront him immediately, <br/>\ncalmly, and tell him, &quot; that really hurts my feelings, Solly. Are <br/>\nthere other words you can use to tell Ryan how you feel? I <br/>\nunderstand that you are frustrated, right? But I love you, and I <br/>\nlove Ryan, and it hurts my heart when someone says something mean to <br/>\nyou.&quot; At which time he starts to explain, and we solve the problem, <br/>\nwith Ryan jumping in &quot;yeah, Solly, that makes me sad&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have lots of frustrated behaviors that I am appalled at <br/>\nalso. I&#39;ve stopped worrying about where they &quot;get them&quot; from, <br/>\nbecause I think every human has the potential to be violent and <br/>\ndangerous when they&#39;re angry. I think of it as kind of like free <br/>\nform anger, it&#39;s just not nearly as pleasant to watch as, say, free <br/>\nform dancing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know there&#39;re lots of other facets to your situation I&#39;m not even <br/>\ntouching on, but I think it&#39;s vitally important to let kids know, <br/>\nespecially when they are being  violently expressive of their <br/>\nfrustrations, exactly how it makes you feel, and then sit right <br/>\nthere with them, without even saying anything or asking any <br/>\nquestions, just watch her, let her feel that you are there with her <br/>\nin this, and let her make the first move.
