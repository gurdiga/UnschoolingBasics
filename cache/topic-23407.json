It is HUGE lesson and HUGE generation gap.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I agree that knowing one&#39;s family history is a huge lesson in how life changes.  I&#39;m big on history, and can tell most of the family stories from both my own and dh&#39;s extended family. One of his grandmothers was a picture bride in Hawaii in 1911.  One of my grandmothers lived in a dugout shortly after her family arrived in Oklahoma.  Heck, dh & I are old enough (51 & 44) to share very different stories -- b&w TV&#39;s, party-line phones, getting indoor plumbing in my grandma&#39;s house when I was 6yo (I remember the outhouse) -- with our kids.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  But it&#39;s not about how much more we have, it&#39;s just really cool stories about how people used to live -- and likely will again my kids&#39; lifetimes when oil runs out (but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother story).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  When you shared the &#39;tell family stories&#39; example, it was in answer to a Mom who wanted to know how to make her kids more grateful.  So, you were recommending it as a way to &#39;teach gratitude&#39; -- at least that&#39;s how it read to me.  Then again, I did grow up with the whole ungrateful crap, so maybe it&#39;s just my own bias showing thru.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Growing up in the 80s where everyone had everything and then some, the &quot;me&quot; generation. It was eye-opening to hear what my own grandparents didn&#39;t have... Or what their daily life was, that food and shelter was an issue. Things I didn&#39;t have to think about and started to think about. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  And you thought about it because you had those things, and because as you&#39;ve said, no one was demanding that you be more grateful.  This Mom was lamenting that her children were ungrateful.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My parents never told me to be grateful.

Especially because it&#39;s not just a schooling or not schooling decision--it&#39;s a whole paradigm shift.  Raising a family in this tradition takes a large commitment to this paradigm--no matter the size.  But the larger the family the more needs there are to be met.  I feel overwhelmed with my 3 at times, even though I&#39;ve worked with children most of my life. If I added 2 more to our bunch I&#39;m sure I would feel overwhelmed x2 (at times! ;) )!  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving those feelings is totally normal.  It doesn&#39;t have to sound pretty.  You&#39;re venting those feelings to us, and called it as such when you titled this email and even apologized for unloading (which, imo, you didn&#39;t need to!). I totally get that.  And I think there&#39;s totally a place for venting. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s here...I&#39;m new to this list, too.  But I know, from one parent to another, that kind, gentle support feels best when you are at your wits end.  We are striving to give that (and all we can give) to our children.  It feels so wonderful to get that back from other people, esp. from other parents on the same path! :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, venting, at your wits end,is often an indication that you&#39;ve hit an opportunity for growth--and the breakthrough is bound to be amazing--with the right support!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to you would be to take some time for yourself wherever you can.  Ease up on trying to make everything perfect.  If funds are low for the extra classes, but you feel your batteries are recharged than that&#39;s a better place to be.  The kids can always come up with creative ways to raise the necessary funds.  It might be more fun and therefore infinitely more rewarding for you to be a part of that effort with them then to be sacrificing so much more of yourself working those 12 hr nursing shifts back-to-back every weekend.  When we are unhappy we want to project that onto others and expect (unfairly) for them to make us happy.  I&#39;m sure your children want you to be happy. And to feel that your life is worthwhile.  That the decisions you&#39;re making are the right ones, for your family; for you and them together.  I&#39;m sure they also expect that you are going to take care of yourself, because their natural wisdom is take care of themselves.  In my experience kids truly understand that and are powerfully empathetic (not selfish in the negative way so often portrayed by behaviorists and society in general).  When you do take care of yourself,  you are modeling that for your children naturally and beautifully. :)   They need positive emotional supports and role models infinitely more than any type of academic structure. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we also fall into a trap when we expect our children to give us gratitude for things we think they should have or that they even want.  Oftentimes we are wrong on those assumptions.  They might rather be part of a decision making process that brings everyone together--even if means working together--than told to be thankful because you (or someone else) did something for them they didn&#39;t get to decide if they wanted or needed in the first place.  Kids have amazing insight and are loving and eager to be helpful and participatory towards a common goal when given a chance to be involved. <br/>\n<br/>\nStrip your life down to its bare bones in your analysis.  Decide what you really need to be happy and let the rest go--if you can.  Dialogue with your family about your insights and see what insights they might have to share.  This is breaking down walls instead of building them up.  We all need support in this process, and our families are often the best source of support (so often left untapped!) if we open ourselves up to them in ways that may be new to us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck and lots of ((((LOVE)))) to you and your wonderful, large, unschooling family.  I hope you&#39;re able to give to yourself more and let the kids decide what they can do to help meet their goals or interests, while you do some deschooling of your own! Deschool/Unschool yourself!

I need to vent!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am wondering if there are any large, unschooling families out <br/>\n  there? By &quot;large&quot; I am talking a family of 5 or more school aged <br/>\n  children + parent(s) makes 6 or 7 members or more in the household.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are considered a large family by most people&#39;s standards - <br/>\n  myself, my husband, and our five children ages 12,11,9,8,6 - and we <br/>\n  are an unschooling family. I&#39;m beginning to think that we may need <br/>\n  to incorporate some kind of academic structure, though, as the <br/>\n  children are really starting to polish off my nerves. They are <br/>\n  really good kids, generally speaking, but the pre-teen thing is <br/>\n  kicking in (moods, attitudes, etc) and the bickering, complaining <br/>\n  about almost anything that isn&#39;t their way or what THEY want to do <br/>\n  no matter if it is actually a necessity (such as coming along with <br/>\n  me to the market to help me out with buying the $800.00+ worth of <br/>\n  food and groceries that THEY will be eating and consuming too!!!!). <br/>\n  I&#39;m just sick of the ungrateful attitudes, especially because I try <br/>\n  so hard to allow them to learn in freedom. I do this by staying up <br/>\n  half the night many nights researching opportunities for them to <br/>\n  experience things that are related to whatever it is they are <br/>\n  interested in at the moment, I work 12 hour shifts at night (I&#39;m a <br/>\n  nurse) EVERY WEEKEND in order to #1 supplement our household income <br/>\n  so that finances generally aren&#39;t an issue when they decide they <br/>\n  want a new experience, a day trip, or try a new hobby or something, <br/>\n  and #2 be home Mon-Fri with them so that I am not working during the <br/>\n  week and too tired to do whatever it is they are interested in <br/>\n  doing....nursing is a very physically demanding job I&#39;m sure you can <br/>\n  imagine and I am dead tired and sore at the end of my shifts...When <br/>\n  I ask them to do something out of necessity, the attitudes are <br/>\n  rotten and they seem to be getting out of control with the computer <br/>\n  games...I mean, they have started to act outside of themselves - <br/>\n  almost obsessive i feel.

That is nine with <br/>\nparents.  For me the biggest issue becomes me getting tired. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 17 yo daughter who works at five in the morning and teen <br/>\nboys still up at 1 am playing WOW. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has worked for us is one thing my shifting attitudes and being <br/>\ngrateful for all the things they are doing. Me showing interest and <br/>\nsetting some of my agenda things down a moment. I say that as I look <br/>\naround my totally messy house.. LOL...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had talks about how to negotiate everyone working out what <br/>\nthey want, including me. I think that is helping us all learn some <br/>\nreally valuable life skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I just own up that I need some help. Most days there is a <br/>\ntime that I ask if everyone can help me straighten up. They are <br/>\npretty darn willing. I am also pretty darn willing when they ask me <br/>\nfor help. But sometimes I own up on that too. Last night I had a <br/>\nchild who wanted to learn how to bake a cake from scratch at ten <br/>\nthirty. I was toast. I said I am afraid if I help you right now I <br/>\nwill be crabby because I am really tired, but I will be happy to <br/>\nhelp you in the morning if you want to wait. He was more than happy <br/>\nto have me assist in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes with grocery shopping I ask the kids to help. I always <br/>\nhave them make suggestions for the list and then offer to take <br/>\nwhoever with me to do shopping. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe bickering also becomes an issue for me. It really does help me <br/>\nstretch me skills in helping them negotiate. If I notice I have a <br/>\nkid out of sorts I try to keep that kid closer to me. See if they <br/>\nwant to do something with me till they can work it out in there own <br/>\nbodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as a large unschooling family we do have more demands, but <br/>\nit helps me to be honest about my own feelings and needs to not hit <br/>\nburn out. Our kids getting exactly what they want every minute is <br/>\nnot what unschooling is about. It is about learning from life and <br/>\nexploring our own interests.

Or are you hoping it will help you? Do you need textbooks to accomplish structure <br/>\nthroughout the day, or would working on a self-routine accomplish more of that? <br/>\nIt seems to me that moms of big families (myself included) try to follow the same lifestyle <br/>\nthat we&#39;d have with only one or two children. it&#39;s not possible! We have to create our own <br/>\nlife, our own family, and it won&#39;t look the same. Housework won&#39;t look the same, meals <br/>\nwon&#39;t look the same, time with the kids won&#39;t look the same. I&#39;d say you ARE at the end of <br/>\nthe rope, and it&#39;s fair to say &quot;I can&#39;t do it all myself, I need your help&quot;. But only say that <br/>\nafter you&#39;ve looked at EVERYTHING you are doing, and really really pick and choose the <br/>\nmost important. Why do you have to stay up half the night to find important things for the <br/>\nkids? Can they look themselves? Can you limit yourself to fifteen minutes per child, <br/>\ngoogling their particular interests, jot it down and tell them you found such-n-so on the <br/>\nweb and you were wondering if they&#39;d like to follow up? Back when we had less computers, <br/>\nthe computer we did have had bookmark folders for each child, so i could easily save a <br/>\nbookmark in each folder as I came across stuff.<br/>\nYou can&#39;t do the impossible, fit more hours into the day. With a big family, everyone isn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to be able to do every little thing outside of the home that sounds interesting, at <br/>\nleast not without some creative phone management. If they have a class, ask the other <br/>\nmoms if they would mind carpooling. If one wants a field trip and the others don&#39;t want to <br/>\ngo, see if the kids can play at someone&#39;s house for a few hours. Build some social capital <br/>\nwith neighbors, acquaintances at your regular gatherings so that you have people you can <br/>\ndepend on.<br/>\nI&#39;d ask if I was killing myself maintaining household standards that no one else really cares <br/>\nabout (my hardest self-burden) I clean one room a day, and it takes me maybe half an <br/>\nhour to wipe everything down with chlorox cleanup and dry it off. For tough stains I use a <br/>\nmagic sponge. <br/>\nI&#39;d ask myself why they need to go shopping? We sit down once a month and make a meal <br/>\nschedule (totally flexible, but helps us plan) The kids have their input then, and if they <br/>\nchoose to stay home (okay, not the littles, but Josh and Emily and Rachel can stay home in <br/>\npairs) instead of dealing with the incredible tedium of shopping. Mostly they like to go <br/>\nshopping because we can just talk without everyone&#39;s interests getting in the way. <br/>\nSometimes Josh would rather stay home to work on soldering while the littles are gone, or <br/>\nEmily and Rachel want to finish a level on WarioWare without Sam and Dan interfering. It&#39;s <br/>\nhelpful to them.<br/>\nif my kids are bickering about something, i ask them for solutions. They don&#39;t like dinner, <br/>\nfine, they are welcome to find something else, make something else, ASK for help with <br/>\nfinding something else. We&#39;re set up to succeed, with healthy alternatives already put <br/>\ntogether in the fridge. We always plan leftovers of favorites. <br/>\nI&#39;d also ask if I was projecting MY feelings into the group. If you see shopping as a burden, <br/>\nyour children will definitely pick-up on that and see it as a burden to be endured, some <br/>\nattitude will definitely show if they are being FORCED to do something that is a burden. I <br/>\ncan choose not to see it as a burden, personally I see it as a blessing to be able to <br/>\npurchase and prepare food for my family that is inexpensive and nourishing. I thank God <br/>\nthat we have the money to buy food (because we haven&#39;t always) and that I have choices to <br/>\nbuy what I can. Now, laundry i&#39;m not always joyful about, but I do try, because of some <br/>\nposts on here that have reminded me that I am blessed to have my children there to wear <br/>\nthe clothes. Pumping raw sewage tonight was a trial, but I was Pollyanna enough to find <br/>\nsome blessings out of it, the basement is totally sterilized and cleaner than it has been <br/>\nin...oh, probably since we moved in. Maybe earlier. We&#39;ve never had a plumbing issue in <br/>\nthree years of living here, and our new neighbors had one before they even moved in. We <br/>\nwere blessed in that the guy had called backup and just by chance forced the last two feet <br/>\nof snake down the drain and hit the block. He was able to cancel the call and saved us <br/>\n$500 in additional fees. <br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, it&#39;s even later now, 2:30 and I need a shower. Blech, I smell like bleach but it&#39;s still <br/>\nnot enough. The kids got to learn a terrible lot about plumbing and toilet paper tonight, <br/>\nso i walk away hopeful that they will be a little more conservative in their usage. <br/>\nNine people are very hard on plumbing.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;anissalmuslimah&quot; &lt;ummabdullah@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am wondering if there are any large, unschooling families out <br/>\n&gt; there?

You can&#39;t be a role model and a joyful parent <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re stressed and on your last nerve. Talk to your kids about <br/>\nhow you&#39;re feeling and see what you can all come up with. I&#39;ve had <br/>\nreally good results with this in my home. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, try to not get to the point of no return. Be proactive, not <br/>\nreactive. I do my best (it&#39;s not always easy lately but I make a big <br/>\neffort), to take care of myself on a daily basis so that it doesn&#39;t <br/>\never get to be to much. For example, I get super stressed when the <br/>\nhouse is cluttered. It makes it very hard for me to function when <br/>\nthere&#39;s stuff everywhere. If I keep up with it a little at a time <br/>\nthroughout the day so that it never gets really bad, it&#39;s better for <br/>\nme (which in turn is better for my kids because I don&#39;t snap at <br/>\nthem) than letting it pile up because then I get cranky. I know this <br/>\nabout myself and I do what I can to avoid it. What are your triggers?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were getting ready to adopt our kids (we adopted all three-<br/>\nthey&#39;re siblings), our caseworker had a sign in her office that <br/>\nsaid &quot;Behavior is the language of a childs emotion&quot;. I think of that <br/>\nwhenever my kids behavior is not what it usually is and I try to <br/>\nfigure out what emotion they&#39;re trying to express. It sounds like <br/>\nyou need to spend more time with your kids (maybe one on one) and <br/>\nsee what&#39;s going on with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this helps!<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nAdd your voice ~ Unschooling Voices<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/26pt6x\">http://tinyurl.com/26pt6x</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229313747,"authorName":"anissalmuslimah","from":"&quot;anissalmuslimah&quot; &lt;ummabdullah@...&gt;","profile":"anissalmuslimah","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Any large unschooling families?

By &quot;large&quot; I am talking a family of 5 or more school aged <br/>\nchildren + parent(s) makes 6 or 7 members or more in the household.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are considered a large family by most people&#39;s standards - <br/>\nmyself, my husband, and our five children ages 12,11,9,8,6 - and we <br/>\nare an unschooling family.  I&#39;m beginning to think that we may need <br/>\nto incorporate some kind of academic structure, though, as the <br/>\nchildren are really starting to polish off my nerves.  They are <br/>\nreally good kids, generally speaking, but the pre-teen thing is <br/>\nkicking in (moods, attitudes, etc) and the bickering, complaining <br/>\nabout almost anything that isn&#39;t their way or what THEY want to do <br/>\nno matter if it is actually a necessity (such as coming along with <br/>\nme to the market to help me out with buying the $800.00+ worth of <br/>\nfood and groceries that THEY will be eating and consuming too!!!!).  <br/>\nI&#39;m just sick of the ungrateful attitudes, especially because I try <br/>\nso hard to allow them to learn in freedom.  I do this by staying up <br/>\nhalf the night many nights researching opportunities for them to <br/>\nexperience things that are related to whatever it is they are <br/>\ninterested in at the moment, I work 12 hour shifts at night (I&#39;m a <br/>\nnurse) EVERY WEEKEND in order to #1 supplement our household income <br/>\nso that finances generally aren&#39;t an issue when they decide they <br/>\nwant a new experience, a day trip, or try a new hobby or something, <br/>\nand #2 be home Mon-Fri with them so that I am not working during the <br/>\nweek and too tired to do whatever it is they are interested in <br/>\ndoing....nursing is a very physically demanding job I&#39;m sure you can <br/>\nimagine and I am dead tired and sore at the end of my shifts...When <br/>\nI ask them to do something out of necessity, the attitudes are <br/>\nrotten and they seem to be getting out of control with the computer <br/>\ngames...I mean, they have started to act outside of themselves - <br/>\nalmost obsessive i feel.  Not to mention, I feel if we have more <br/>\nstructure, I&#39;d be able to get a bit more accomplished for myself <br/>\nwithout having to stay up each night til the wee hours!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve babbled enough. I&#39;m not sure if I even got to the point of what <br/>\nthe real problem may be? LOL...sorry for unloading.  Any advice will <br/>\nbe appreciated. Thanks for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23472,"nextTopicId":23326}}
