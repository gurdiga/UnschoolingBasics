(Another story)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my son and I discussed all his options from going back to school with the freedom to leave whenever he wished to so he could see what he was missing to trying some virtual classes, to a wide variety of other options that didn&#39;t seem to fill his need.  He wanted nothing to do with getting around large groups of kids especially after seeing the effect it was having on his cousin so he opted to try a couple of virtual classes.  It didn&#39;t take long for him to come back to me and say, &quot;Is this all kids my age are doing in school?&quot;  My son very quickly saw that he actually knew more.  For this one, learning comes naturally at an accelerated pace.  He soon returned to complete unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest you spend some time helping your daughter discover what she needs [desires to learn] and help her find a pleasant path to those goals.  If she is feeling &#39;behind in math&#39;, there are all sorts of books to read.  Here&#39;s a short list:<br/>\nSir Cumference and the First Round Table : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.charlesbridge.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=4461\">http://www.charlesbridge.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=4461</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nMurderous Math : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/\">http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nLife of Fred : <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stanleyschmidt.com/FredGauss/index2.html\">http://www.stanleyschmidt.com/FredGauss/index2.html</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tons of free online math games and other games that stimulate the thinking.

And basically the only model they know of is school. So the free form exploration they&#39;re doing can feel it comes up short.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a period of transitions between interests. So it can be a more difficult time for her to explore interests. And school can look like it has some magical process of getting that vague feeling of needing focus but can&#39;t quite put her finger on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf her worries about school, if other parents &quot;successes&quot; at school are making you worried, you&#39;ll have a hard time helping both of you not worry!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to convince her. From her point of view she&#39;s right. If we could tell people the right way to think and cause them to change, then schools would be huge successes.<br/>\n<br/>\nShift your thinking from learning being about acquiring facts and skills to learning being about exploring interests. Do other things. Explore the world in other ways. (Others will have more practical advice! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":501025744,"authorName":"Loretta B.","from":"&quot;Loretta B.&quot; &lt;tinamariesmom@...&gt;","profile":"tinamariesmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Worried","postDate":"1329131281","msgId":47915,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBS2NQbnJ3bnZCYW45eUwrXzNXZUxNLWpFZ1hQM05FWDFoSm1PWloyZ3Y4NkVIMDVOUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47916,"prevInTime":47914,"nextInTime":47916,"topicId":47915,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, Every year I get worried that my child is falling behind.

This year,<br/>\nespecially, because I had to drop everything to take care of my Mom for 2<br/>\nmonths.  I don&#39;t have alot of support with unschooling in my area (Simi<br/>\nValley, CA).   Most all of the homeschooling groups I belong to have a<br/>\ncurriculum and a set school schedule.  I never did.  I always tried to do<br/>\nlife learning or child led, yet always felt like I wasn&#39;t doing enough,<br/>\nwhen I heard the other Moms talking about what they were doing.  Now, my 10<br/>\nyear old, only child girl is starting to think that she isn&#39;t as smart as<br/>\nother children and although I try to convince her otherwise, she is not<br/>\nconvinced.  I&#39;m getting antsy about next year (which would be 6th grade),<br/>\nas she has never had an interest in Math and so, we haven&#39;t done much with<br/>\nit.  I found a book that I&#39;ve been reading to her about Math concepts and I<br/>\nthink she is finally understanding.  She feels as though she is at a 3rd<br/>\ngrade level.  I feel it is always difficult to start things in the morning<br/>\nand we are often &quot;on the go&quot; to fieldtrips and such.  I need some pointers<br/>\nand recomendations from this group please.  Thank you...Signed Freaking out<br/>\nin Simi....Loretta<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47907,"nextTopicId":47919}}
