It gets <br/>\neaten, I can promise that. Sometimes certain things get ignored, but <br/>\nI can tell you that children need to graze, and if you make many <br/>\nchoices available, they will quickly learn to listen to their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have unlimited money either, so I do have to say no. But I <br/>\ntry to make sure the &quot;no&quot; is not arbitrary or reactionary, but for <br/>\nreal reasons. I also like sharing our money with the kids, so when I <br/>\ndon&#39;t have it in the budget, they still have control over their <br/>\nchoices. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe eat sweets and &quot;junk food&quot;, but I&#39;ve learned that giving them <br/>\ntrue choices means letting go of my preconcieved notions of what a <br/>\nhealthy diet consists of. I look around at all the people in my life <br/>\nI consider mindful and healthy, and realize they all eat VERY <br/>\ndifferently! My children will find what makes sense to them, their <br/>\njourney is uniquely their own. I trust them to make good choices for <br/>\ntheir lives, and that trust is essential in opening true dialogue.<br/>\nThey don&#39;t make the choices I would, but that&#39;s good.:) I&#39;m a <br/>\ncertified health freak...not everyone should have to eat or live <br/>\nlike me, my kids included.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":298,"nextTopicId":292}}
