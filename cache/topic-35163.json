So we got<br/>\na video with some basic signs that&#39;s kids might want to use (mommy,<br/>\ndaddy, grandma, potty, cookie, juice...) It was fun and still comes in<br/>\nhandy when we&#39;re in really noisy places - we can basically communicate<br/>\nthings like &quot;more drink&quot; (which, for us, is a generic reference to<br/>\nwhatever he is currently drinking) or &quot;potty&quot;. Really reduces the<br/>\nfrustration level when the fireworks are booming all around and he wants<br/>\nanother snack.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
