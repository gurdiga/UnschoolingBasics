BUT, if<br/>\nyou&#39;re talking about rules and limitations that vary from home to<br/>\nhome, that&#39;s real life. Kids are smart. They learn that their<br/>\nrelatinship with Grandma is different from their relationship with Mom<br/>\nor Dad. That&#39;s ok. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think telling other people how to respect our radical unschooling<br/>\npreferences is disrespectful! Let your child own their relationship<br/>\nwith the Grandparent and unless it&#39;s truly harmful, give it some<br/>\nspace. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s doing kids any favors to make them think<br/>\nthat other households need to honor OUR way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur home is different, they understand that. So far, it hasn&#39;t been a<br/>\nbig issue to adjust to different homes and spaces and the rules or<br/>\nlimitations therein.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling basics for grandparents","postDate":"1167582523","msgId":20152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGNTdGNjU1LTJDRkEtNDhCNi05RDE0LTlCQTlGRjQyNzRBRUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVuNnI2OCtzMm9jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVuNnI2OCtzMm9jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20151,"nextInTopic":20156,"prevInTime":20151,"nextInTime":20153,"topicId":20139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
