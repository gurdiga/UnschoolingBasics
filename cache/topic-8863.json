When he starts to get ugly, place yourself between<br/>\nhim and the children and solve the problem. My dh was never super loud<br/>\nor anything, but he is known to get edgy and grumpy about messes. <br/>\nRather than jumping on the kids WITH him, I became their defender. <br/>\nI tried to do it in a manner that didn&#39;t put HIM on the defensive...so<br/>\nI started helping the kids, being their friend, making sure he knew<br/>\nthat if he bitched at them it was affecting ME.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started backing off.<br/>\nHe still gets grumpy about the household mess at times, but he&#39;s<br/>\nreally quiet about it usually.:) Most of the time he just cleans up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night, he cleaned up the kitchen after all of us (again) and<br/>\nthere was this can of refried beans left open.

And they clean up after me, and they clean up after<br/>\nthemselves and it&#39;s all GOOD honey. Really. I pointed out that Trevor<br/>\nhad cooked himself a meal, cleaned up the entire thing and left a<br/>\nstupid can of beans out and here he is focusing on the beans and NOT<br/>\nthe ten other cool things Trevor did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually laughed at that point, because he was really just tired and<br/>\nbeing silly.

He just gets upset easily, and I try to remind him to step outside of the frustration and look at the real issues and not just the mess/noise/etc.  It&#39;s just hard for him to keep from getting frustrated quickly when there is a lot of loud noise.  He does try hard, it&#39;s just keeping him on track that these are people and we can talk with them and resolve issues in a small easy way instead of escalating it into a loud power struggle.  But he is catching on, and although he doesn&#39;t always agree with my choices, he does find that after time it&#39;s an improvement.  Right now he&#39;s really not happy with our unschooling choice, but he&#39;s willing to wait and see how it develops.  He knows I will do what suits the kids best.  He does want to be a better, more tolerant parent, he just needs some guidance.  It&#39;s just frustrating sometimes when he looses patience so quickly and yells at them.  But then again I had to grow and evolve too, so I&#39;m sure as he gets used to the concepts he will be able to handle the noise and mess better.  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8885,"nextTopicId":8877}}
