Had she continued to have teachers like that she probably<br/>\nwould still be in school as I wouldn&#39;t have been motivated to move towards<br/>\nhomeschooling.  They were seriously wonderful!  They allowed her to move at<br/>\nher own pace (which was ahead of everyone else) read what she wanted,<br/>\ncreate, move, and play at learning.  Yes; still highly structured in<br/>\ncomparison to what her days are like now, but these two women were some of<br/>\nthe most wonderful examples of what teachers can be.  Emily&#39;s second grade<br/>\nteacher was also one of my biggest supporters when we pulled her out the<br/>\nnext year!
