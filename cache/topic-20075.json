After spending two days watching every Naruto fan flash he could find, now he wants to make one -- or several.  I told him we&#39;d tackle that this weekend when I could devote my full attention to it.  How do we make a fan flash video, or any other kind of video?  Does it require special software?  Anyone have a favorite site for it -- preferably one that will walk me thru it.  I&#39;m pretty brave as far as trying new stuff on the computer is concerned, and I&#39;m willing to try this but don&#39;t want it to be too frustrating for us.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
