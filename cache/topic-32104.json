I have no marketing materials to post, so please bear <br/>\nwith me. I do not know if this is a traveling exhibit that will come <br/>\nto your state or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom April 12- the end of July or August, the XL Center in Hartford <br/>\nhas the Titanic Exhibit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess this is not just a bunch of artifacts on shelves...but they <br/>\nhave the exhibit set up where your ticket is a boarding pass with the <br/>\nname of an actual passenger on it. When you enter, you are walking <br/>\non boards like that from a ship in that time. There are passage ways <br/>\nthat make you feel like you are actually on the Titanic! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe exhibit is interactive and I thought it would be an awesome <br/>\nhistory lesson for home schoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI plan on traveling from Western New York State to Hartford next <br/>\nmonth on business. I also plan on bringing my kids so we can check <br/>\nit out in person.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32066,"nextTopicId":32113}}
