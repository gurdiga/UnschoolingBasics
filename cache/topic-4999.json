First of all, I<br/>\nthink unschooling is the natural way for everyone to learn, *especially* ADD<br/>\nkids. As an adult, I can remember more things I learned outside of school,<br/>\nat my own pace and in my own way (i.e. books I read for pleasure, things I<br/>\nlearned through play, through family activities, extracurriculars, etc) than<br/>\nthings I learned in school. The wonderful thing about unschooling is that<br/>\nyou can just enjoy life, and let the learning happen. Having said that, as a<br/>\nmom/teacher I know *I* would be uptight about making sure that my child is<br/>\nlearning everything she&#39;ll need to know. That&#39;s where my more &#39;schooly&#39;<br/>\ntendencies would come in, and I&#39;m almost afraid to admit that on this<br/>\nboard...but my suggestion is you can control the input and influence you<br/>\nhave on your daughter by making decisions that may not affect *directly*<br/>\nwhat she learns, but indirectly, by defining what she&#39;s exposed to. By way<br/>\nof an example, as a child I was a bookworm and would read just about<br/>\nanything that crossed my hands. I was lucky that my parents picked up on<br/>\nthis and made some good decisions about the kind of literature they exposed<br/>\nme to. (Abridged versions of the classics at an early age made me familiar<br/>\nwith the stories so that later nothing intimidated me, for example). Another<br/>\nthing is that they offered me music lessons (different instruments at<br/>\ndifferent times in my life) but always gave me the option to try something<br/>\nfor a while and then quit after a reasonable period of time if there was<br/>\nsome problem. This was very enrichment and it didn&#39;t &quot;teach me I could quit&quot;<br/>\nlike some may fear, it taught me to appreciate music and actually helped me<br/>\ndecide to stick with it once I found &quot;my&quot; instrument was a wind instrument<br/>\n(the flute) vs. a string instrument (I quit the cello after only a month or<br/>\nso). Yeah, I  now wish I could play the cello too, but most of all I&#39;m<br/>\ngrateful for the opportunities. OK, I&#39;ve gone on too long now, but I guess<br/>\nthe point I wanted to make was it&#39;ll be up to you to provide the<br/>\nopportunities for your daughter as an unschooler. As long as you keep those<br/>\nopportunities coming in a wide range of areas (sports and physical activity,<br/>\nvisual and performing arts, academics, etc) I think this could be very very<br/>\ngood for your daughter. Best of luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Mar 17, 2008 at 3:56 PM, Elaine Pontious &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:eapontious@...\">eapontious@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Hi, everyone,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just wanted to introduce myself.

When dd was very young she would tell me about kids that<br/>\ntried to talk to her when she was going to sleep. She was more annoyed<br/>\nby it than scared. She specifically spoke about one little boy dressed<br/>\nin a red shirt who just wouldn&#39;t be quiet. Although I have never had<br/>\nsuch experiences, I was willing to take her seriously and understand<br/>\nthat she very well may have been experiencing these things. I talked<br/>\nto her about in a factual kind of way (not as though I was just<br/>\nhumoring her) and together we came up with ideas that might encourage<br/>\nthese visitors to let her sleep peacefully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis issue subsided after a couple months. Not long after that she<br/>\nstarted telling me about memories she had of us playing together as<br/>\nchildren, when I was her sister. She would share very vivid details<br/>\nabout the games we played, what we wore, the house we lived in, etc.<br/>\nShe told me she really missed us being kids together (and cried).<br/>\nAgain, I took her totally serious. I cannot know if these were real<br/>\nmemories or if they came from somewhere deep inside her imagination,<br/>\nbut to her they were very real and that&#39;s what mattered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a year later her great-grandfather, whom she had a special<br/>\nrelationship with, passed away unexpectedly. The phone rang late at<br/>\nnight, it was my mom calling to tell me. I spoke with her quietly and<br/>\nhung up. A moment later we heard dd crying - we found her sitting up<br/>\nin her bed, shaking and sobbing. She said that &quot;big papa&quot; (her name<br/>\nfor him) had come to &quot;say goodbye&quot;, she woke up and he was sitting on<br/>\nher bed. She related that he&#39;d told her he was leaving and she<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t see him anymore. This news was very upsetting to her. Did it<br/>\nreally happen? What I focused on where her feelings, because they were<br/>\nreal and needed to be cared for. All I can say is that for whatever<br/>\nreason, the universe wanted to give her a chance to say goodbye to<br/>\nhim, no matter whether it was a coincidental dream or a &quot;other<br/>\nworldly&quot; phenomenon.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has never been shamed in any way for sharing these things with us,<br/>\nand we never took her feelings lightly, even when our life experience<br/>\nhas made it difficult to completely understand her experiences. This<br/>\nis not to say that humor and similar coping tools haven&#39;t been useful<br/>\n- we just never employed them in a dismissive/mocking way. In many<br/>\nways, she has opened up new windows into the world for us. I cannot<br/>\nimagine children going through similar experiences and not having<br/>\nanyone take them seriously. They should have someone they feel safe<br/>\nsharing these things with, someone who can validate their feelings and<br/>\nbe supportive.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New Here","postDate":"1197064175","msgId":28297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ0Yy4xMzk5MTYzZC4zNDhiMTllZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28290,"nextInTopic":28298,"prevInTime":28296,"nextInTime":28298,"topicId":4999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/7/2007 7:55:32 A.M.

If they tend to cluster in certain areas, avoid them if <br/>\nthat&#39;s possible (like if they pop up in crowded stores or whatever). <br/>\nIf it&#39;s someplace like her bedroom, the bathroom, etc where you really <br/>\ncan&#39;t avoid the location, make her a &quot;ghost spray&quot; that she can use at <br/>\nwill. Something like mint or wintergreen or lavendar in water in a <br/>\nspray bottle (something that smells nice but leaves no marks or <br/>\nstains) that she can use to hold them at bay might help - basically, <br/>\nARM her as well as be WITH her when she is going into those areas <br/>\n(make another bottle for yourself maybe). Basically, look for common <br/>\nthreads - when and where is it most likely that she&#39;ll be bothered by <br/>\nthem? That may give you some insight into where they are coming from <br/>\nand you can use that information to help her with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 yr olds are just starting to grasp that the world is WAY bigger than <br/>\nthey are. Up until them, a tight circle of mom and child and other <br/>\nimmediate family is pretty much &quot;the world&quot; even if you&#39;re out and <br/>\nabout all the time. At 2, they&#39;re starting to be able to venture forth <br/>\ninto the wide world and it can be scary. That&#39;s why some kids go into <br/>\nthe &quot;separation anxiety&quot; phase around that age - they&#39;re discovering <br/>\nthat there&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot; Out There. It&#39;s interesting that your DD is <br/>\nspecific that it&#39;s ghosts, not generic monsters or darkness or <br/>\nanything, but ghosts.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":330437093,"authorName":"kara","from":"&quot;kara&quot; &lt;sunshinedaydream2@...&gt;","profile":"gratefulmama22","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New Here","postDate":"1197038305","msgId":28286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZqYmx0MStoMzJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22823,"nextInTopic":28290,"prevInTime":28285,"nextInTime":28287,"topicId":4999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I am new here.

We do the things they need and enjoy from birth.<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about buying specialized educational toys (though<br/>\nsometimes they do swirl into our lives) or specialized &quot;social&quot;<br/>\ngroups.

But the one thing that is a constant<br/>\nthroughout all days is that when the kids want to know something or do<br/>\nsomething or I sense them needing me, I try my best to answer their<br/>\nquestions and help them do what they want to do or just be with them. It&#39;s<br/>\nreally all about *being* with them.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSome days are spent playing computer games all day. Other days are spent at<br/>\nthe horse barn.  Some days we spend half the day playing board games and<br/>\nother days we spend in the pool or curled up with a good book.  The thing<br/>\nis, as long as you are involved with your kids, really listening to them,<br/>\nthey will learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spend the bulk of most days cleaning my house to impress the<br/>\nrelatives, I spend it *being* with my kids.  Not just in body, but in mind.<br/>\nBeing present in the moment.   I give them my whole attention when I am<br/>\nbeing with them.  I am not saying that they don&#39;t spend huge parts of some<br/>\ndays playing with their friends or at the computer, but I do make sure that<br/>\nevery day we make a connection and I give them my full attention.  If that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen until after dinner and the dishes are piled up and I am<br/>\ntired, I still try to put those worries aside and just *be* with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That *being* with them can look like snuggling in front of the TV, or<br/>\nlooking something up on-line, or helping them craft or paint, reading to<br/>\nthem, playing in the pool with them, spending time at the barn with<br/>\nthem...helping with the horses.  When you spend that amount of time really<br/>\npresent with your kids, you can&#39;t help but notice that they are learning all<br/>\nthe time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest you skip the OM curriculum and spend time playing with your<br/>\nson.  If he wants to know how to read, help him while he has the interest,<br/>\ndon&#39;t wait until fall.  But also, don&#39;t push more than he wants.  It can be<br/>\na delicate balance but he&#39;ll let you know when you&#39;ve gone to far if you<br/>\nlisten to him.   If he would have fun labeling things in the house or<br/>\nmatching pictures and words or playing letter sound games then by all means,<br/>\nplay those things with him.  If he only meant that he wanted to be able to<br/>\nread and write his name then stop when he has had his fill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New Here","postDate":"1119731842","msgId":5680,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5a2ZhMitsZHNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQ5aGFiZCtyMjExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5679,"nextInTopic":5681,"prevInTime":5679,"nextInTime":5681,"topicId":4999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sarah.

Sounds like you answered your own question &quot;I know he&#39;s <br/>\nlearning everyday&quot; - that&#39;s pretty much the bottom line, isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nRecordkeeping - what do the LAWS of your state require (including <br/>\nwhat the minimum compulsory age is - not always 5)? That&#39;s what you <br/>\nneed to consider. For instance, here in CT, there is no <br/>\nrecordkeeping or testing or reporting requirement of any kind, so we <br/>\ndon&#39;t do any recordkeeping. We do email grandma and chat with family <br/>\nabout stuff DS (just turned 7) is doing. Note we talk about what he <br/>\nis *doing* not what we&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot; or he&#39;s &quot;learning&quot; - it&#39;s as <br/>\nmuch about video games and hot wheels cars as it is about books and <br/>\nchess games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are long archive threads about &quot;teaching&quot; - if by teaching you <br/>\nmean providing information and assistance in developing a skill he <br/>\nhas decided to pursue, then yes we do some teaching. However, if by <br/>\nteaching you mean we decide that &quot;at his age he should know&quot; this or <br/>\nthat and then we focus on it and make sure it gets into him, no we <br/>\ndon&#39;t teach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have an Oak Meadow curriulum that was given to us and I might <br/>\n&gt; try &gt;to&gt; do some of the activities out of there this fall, Gryphon <br/>\n&gt; is&gt; expressing an interest in reading and so I figured maybe I <br/>\n&gt; would &gt;try&gt; some phonics stuff<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s expressing interest -now- why not simply do some reading -<br/>\nnow-, any particular reason to wait until fall? Do you want to hear <br/>\nabout DS learning to read? If not, skip this next paragraph of <br/>\nanecdotal evidence. He was almost 5 and told us we &quot;needed&quot; to get <br/>\nHooked on Phonics so he could learn to read. I suggested that since <br/>\nHOP took $$ and time to arrive, maybe we could start with something <br/>\nwe already had handy. He was okay with that (immediacy above all <br/>\nthings!lol). Note, at this point he already knew letters, letter <br/>\nsounds, a handful of sight words (exit, on, off, dog, stop, etc). I <br/>\npulled out 100 ez lessons (I picked it up at a discount and thought <br/>\nit would be handy to have around). 5 minutes later it was a <br/>\ndisaster! Too many words on the page (despite them being mostly <br/>\nmy &#39;script&#39;) were intimidating and the parts for him were too simple <br/>\nand silly for him. Put that away (and then *gave* it away). At <br/>\nbedtime I grabbed the first set of Bob books (yup I bought them too -<br/>\n just in case...) We looked at them together, he asked me to read <br/>\nthem all. So I did. Next night, he read the first book and said &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\na reader!&quot; (direct quote from the commercial for HOP lol) and I did <br/>\nthe rest. Next night, he did two of them and we moved on to other <br/>\nstuff. That was a bit over 2 years ago and he can pretty much read <br/>\nanything he chooses at this point (food labels to check nutrition <br/>\nand contents are big for him, video game instructions and guides, <br/>\nbits of magazines at will, like National Geographic). He *learned* <br/>\nto read, *we* did NOT teach him to read. Best I can figure, he <br/>\nabsorbs words then breaks them down into pieces and applies the <br/>\npatterns to new words as he comes across them. Mostly we provided a <br/>\nword rich environment. Kind of like providing a nutrient &quot;soup&quot; to <br/>\ngrow cells - give them the stuff they need when they need it and <br/>\nthey absorb it and grow. The &quot;when&quot; and &quot;what&quot; for kids are <br/>\nindividual and unique. There&#39;s really no set timetable for any of <br/>\nit. Another way to look at it might be as a buffet - we may get <br/>\nextra napkins and support the plate and help scoop but DS decides <br/>\nwhat and how much and in what order he wants things. Sometimes he <br/>\neats 3 servings of mac & cheese; other times he has lots of jello; <br/>\nsometimes he has a different arrangement on each go-round. And, in <br/>\nbetween things, he is digesting and that is a *critical* part of <br/>\nthings yet it is totally invisible from the outside - just as <br/>\nabsorbing things like reading and such are invisible to us on the <br/>\noutside. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, have FUN!<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59910122,"authorName":"tofu2698","from":"&quot;tofu2698&quot; &lt;tofu2698@...&gt;","profile":"tofu2698","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New Here","postDate":"1119628461","msgId":5679,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ5aGFiZCtyMjExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5442,"nextInTopic":5680,"prevInTime":5678,"nextInTime":5680,"topicId":4999,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, My name is Sarah.

I had a brief period of<br/>\ntrying a more structured approach ( a momentary panic attack when eldest ds<br/>\nhit 15 last year) which made the whole household miserable and we quickly<br/>\nhave reverted  to our haphazard, getting on with life learning style.  I<br/>\nlive in the UK and last week had a inspector from the Education Authority<br/>\nround for a visit. It was the first visit I have ever had and some of it did<br/>\nnot go well as I had no idea or interest in what &quot;level&quot; the children were<br/>\nat - in particular my two youngest twin boys who are just 6. Unschooling is<br/>\nlegal here and we have no restrictions but this person who came was not<br/>\nimpressed with the &quot;evidence of education &quot;( she wanted to see a whole<br/>\ncurriculum laid out on the table) and the none curriculum things the<br/>\nchildren had done.  The truthful response was my twins do not write much yet<br/>\nand only one reads a bit and I have no intention of pushing them into it<br/>\nbefore they are ready. This did not go down well.  The person who came could<br/>\nsee something was working ( but not the kids lol)but was mystified as to<br/>\nwhat and I found it very hard to explain how  my children learn by going<br/>\nabout their lives and doing things that interest them and playing.
