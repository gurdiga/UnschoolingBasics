Everything&#39;s relative---*how* badly? And <br/>\nremind me how old they are. ??<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they so often speak to me like I am a stupid erring servant.  I am <br/>\npatient<br/>\nwith this most of the time (depending on what is happenning, like <br/>\nrunning late<br/>\nto work I may have to ignore it).  But last night I snapped and said <br/>\nsharply<br/>\n&quot;Oh!  I am so tired of this!  How could you speak to me this way!  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t<br/>\ntalk to a dog in the gutter like that!  I am a person with feelings!  A <br/>\nreal<br/>\nperson!&quot;  I specifically explained (again, again) how it made me feel.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOK---you DO! &lt;g&gt; But you&#39;re doing it angrily? If they&#39;re getting <br/>\n*anger* in return---maybe that&#39;s what they expect and react in kind. <br/>\nKind of like when someone hits you, you hit back in anger---but with <br/>\nwords. When mine hit me when they were little, rather than get angry <br/>\n(which was my first response), I would get &quot;hurt.&quot; They would respond <br/>\nwith compassion instead of anger. Am I explaining that well?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone hits you (physically or verbally) and you react with <br/>\nanger---either hitting back or yelling---you evoke anger in THEM.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone hits you and you react with surprise and hurt---you evoke their <br/>\ncompassion and sorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a hard thing for me to change---my brother and I fought like <br/>\ncats and dogs, and my parents both used spankings---so hitting made me <br/>\nANGRY. Changing that feeling to hurt (which is what it IS, <br/>\nREALLY!---that anger is just a defense.) is an honest reaction and will <br/>\nevoke a different response.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy with my kids---but if Ben or my parents hurt me, I still <br/>\nreact immediately with anger. I&#39;m *really* hurt and should show it, I <br/>\nguess. I need to work on that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-==-=<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted to escape!

Let me put a bit of a different spin on it. I have two girls 7 & 8. My 7 year old has ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder and Non-Verbal Learning Disability. My 7 year olds social skills and ability to cope are more like that of a 3 year old. She can not get along with her sister, and she is bigger than her older sister. I can not just tell them to work it out or play together when the 7 year old is pummeling the 8 year old. For my 7 year old it&#39;s not about attention. She has no self control, no impulse control and no ability to keep her hands to herself. I as a parent have to step in and protect my 8 year old. I have to step in and model appropriate behavior, and I have to separate them if need be. And I can&#39;t turn away. It does bother me when my 7 year old hits, punches, pinches, bites....... you name it. I can&#39;t let my 8 year old be tortured. When my husband and I are long gone, it&#39;s just gonna<br/>\nbe the two of them.
