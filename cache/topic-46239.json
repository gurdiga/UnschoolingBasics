I tried unsuccessfully to send it privately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling is legal in all 50 states. Unschooling falls under homeschooling. In SC, individual districts must follow SC law. To homeschool (and unschool), you must follow the law. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder SC&#39;s Option 3: the homeschool must belong to an accountability association, and the homeschooling parent/teacher must 1) have minimum high school diploma; 2) teach 180 days; 3) cover reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and social studies---and in grades 9-12, literature and composition; 4) keep daily planner of subjects covered and activities engaged in; 5) keep portfolio of child&#39;s work; 6) write two progress reports each year. No testing or grading is required.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome to contact me for more info.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\nDirector, School&#39;s Out Support Accounatbility Association<br/>\nwww.SchoolsOutSupport.com<br/>\n803 237 4948<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is no single effort more radical in its potential for saving the world than a transformation of the way we raise our children.&quot; Marianne Williamson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Shania &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vamp_grl14@...\">vamp_grl14@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] anderson south carolina(unschooling)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhi im new to this unschooling thing and would like to try it but is there anyone <br/>\nwho can tell me if anderson county school districts allow unschooling because i <br/>\ndon&#39;t know and this is a pressing matter<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46234,"nextTopicId":46253}}
