Ds (5) likes some <br/>\nNickJr. shows: Bob the Builder, Little Einsteins, Wonder Pets, Blues <br/>\nClues, Thomas, Wiggles, Jay Jay, etc. And we are trying to figure <br/>\nwhich other shows are not &quot;mean or scary&quot;. Anyone have suggestions for <br/>\nchildren&#39;s shows which are interesting, action oriented or activity <br/>\ntype shows that he might enjoy? He doesn&#39;t like movies with anyone <br/>\nbeing sad or scared. He has no concept of guns at this point. But, we <br/>\ndesire to expand his world with exposure to shows that are <br/>\nentertaining. We have been fascinated at the depth and breadth of his <br/>\nawareness of life through the videos that he chooses. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16356,"nextTopicId":16376}}
