Unless you & partner can juggle schedules around (flexible shifts<br/>\nfor example), you&#39;ll need to include a third party - relative, friend,<br/>\nwhomever who can be a &quot;daycare&quot; provider because you won&#39;t have the free<br/>\nstate-run daycare of public school. The person with your child does not<br/>\nhave to be a parent specifically *provided* that the other person is<br/>\non-board to some extent with the direction you are choosing. If grandma<br/>\nis able and willing to be on hand and NOT expect schoolwork to happen,<br/>\nthat&#39;d be great. However, it&#39;ll probably take some time to sort out what<br/>\nworks and what doesn&#39;t. For instance, is your DS a very social kid -<br/>\nlikes to be out and about and interacting with lots of people all the<br/>\ntime? If so, you&#39;ll want to incorporate as much social activity as you<br/>\ncan. And, with a 13 yr old, one realistic possibility is to find other<br/>\nfamilies/friends to take him along when they go here or there some of<br/>\nthe time (wouldn&#39;t be as workable with a littler kid as much, though<br/>\nstill possible). What other resources does *he* want in his life -<br/>\naccess to computer? To library? To videogames? To a running track? A<br/>\nskateboard park? Talk it over as a family - it&#39;s certainly possible...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

When we started having trouble with the schools, I was working full-time on the midnight shift and actually fought to keep my son IN school, so I could get some sleep.  That didn&#39;t work.  I pulled him out of Kindergarten when the teacher put him in a two hour time out then forgot about him, locking him in the classroom alone when she took the other kids to the buses.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSince he had tested extremely high on the IQ test, he qualified for the gifted program at another school the following year.  That lasted 15 days.  It&#39;s amazing the amount of damage that can be done to a child&#39;s self-esteem in such a short period.  I called my spouse and told him I couldn&#39;t do it, meaning leave my boy in that class after spending time there myself and witnessing what went on.  My spouse came to the school and he sat in the class. It took him less time and he pulled my son out that day.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince I was still working mids, I refused homeschooling which my spouse really wanted to do but I knew the &#39;burden&#39; of homeschooling would fall to me and I wasn&#39;t ready.  We ended up putting my son in a private school and first grade went well.  Excellent teacher and schools would thrive with more of her but alas, good things don&#39;t last and the next year, my son got a terrible teacher.  The bullying that she didn&#39;t stop, prevent, care to address became overwhelming.  My young son started talking suicidal at age seven.  No place for a child EVER to be emotionally.  They were stomping the joy of LIFE from his being.  I pulled him out that fall after witnessing the teacher call him names in front of the whole school.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I demanded his records and books, I learned that they had tested him at the end of first grade and had found that he was reading above an eighth grade level.  His math was above fourth grade.  He didn&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; their cookie cutter classroom.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI tried to do &#39;school at home&#39; and that was miserable.  Then Grandma had a stroke and moved in and things became even more stressed.  I had to find a solution.  I came across unschooling and started reading, reading, reading.  My son has returned to the happy person he was even though there are some days he is on his own for a few hours to entertain himself.  He gets up when he pleases and weil get online or call me if he wants to talk.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy spouse is a firefighter, so he works every third day so our son isn&#39;t home alone with grandma much.  I guess it helps that we live on a farm.  Anyway, last year, we ended up taking all our kids out of the system.  I wish I had never sent them to school in the first place.  Live and learn. <br/>\nGood luck on your journey and know it can work even if you aren&#39;t a stay at home mom.<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: mldeluca9924 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mldeluca9924@...\">mldeluca9924@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, May 16, 2008 3:06:37 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling/Working<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I are looking into alternatives to public school, and we <br/>\nare both drawn to unschooling because it makes the most sense.
