I do not understand that at all.  And she would say it was all the school&#39;s fault, but she wouldn&#39;t help her daughter at all!!  It was very frustrating to talk to her.  Her daughter was failing and the recently moved and decided to just put her back a grade (although how this is going to help if she still isn&#39;t going to work with her I don&#39;t know).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one thing I LOVE about homeschooling, no stupid homework where you don&#39;t know what the heck they are supposed to be doing.  I told several of my friends that we do all of our schoolwork for the day in the same time or less than their kids spend on their homework (this was before we went to unschooling).  But they kept talking about how time consuming HS is.  Oh well, I used to wonder how people did it too, I guess it just looks so big and scary from the outside.   <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8863,"nextTopicId":8879}}
