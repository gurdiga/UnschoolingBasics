The work he<br/>\ndoes is mostly seasonal so we have a kind of feast and famine income.<br/>\nWhen he gets paid it&#39;s usually a once a month pay check too, so lots of<br/>\nmoney for two days, pay bills, no money the rest of the month. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s part of the reason we started giving Dylan spending money.  I<br/>\nthink I read an article in GWS about a family who gave a dollar for each<br/>\nyear of the childs age each week.  I don&#39;t know if that made sense to me<br/>\nor if I just couldn&#39;t think of a better way to decide but that&#39;s what we<br/>\nstarted doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some months of the year when David doesn&#39;t work so Dylan<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get paid either.   But over the years he&#39;s gotten good at hanging<br/>\non to some money in preparation for the lean times.   He started a<br/>\nsavings account when he was quite young so now if there is an emergency<br/>\nneed for some comic books or drawing supplies he has some resources. <br/>\n<br/>\n***i am tired of telling them that we can&#39;t afford it, we don&#39;t have the<br/>\nmoney, we can&#39;t buy it.  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just hard.  I don&#39;t know of any way it gets easier.  I guess we<br/>\nwant so much to be able to give our kids what they ask for that this<br/>\nnever gets easy.  But kids can understand and I think it&#39;s much kinder to<br/>\nlet them know the reason why they can&#39;t have a thing right now than to<br/>\nkeep money matters secret from them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***and doesn&#39;t want them (the kids) thinking they are poor.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey won&#39;t necessarily think they are poor, especially if you don&#39;t use<br/>\nthose words, they will understand that there is only a certain amount of<br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** does anyone have any books to recommend or other ways of saying that<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have the money to buy something?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI never did get around to reading any books on the subject.  But finding<br/>\na way for Dylan to have his own money has helped a lot.   He&#39;s twelve,<br/>\nand there are neighbors who hire him to dog sit and fish sit when they&#39;re<br/>\naway, and that money usually goes right into his savings account.  If he<br/>\ngets money for birthdays and Christmas, (one of his Tia&#39;s sends &quot;back to<br/>\nschool&quot; money every fall  - &quot;Dear Tia Claire, Thank you so much for the<br/>\ncheck.  You do realize I don&#39;t go to school, right?  I don&#39;t get me none<br/>\nof that fancy book learnin&#39;.  I&#39;ll save it toward my first bail<br/>\nmoney....&quot;  He&#39;s a horrible child, really.&lt;g&gt; )  He puts most gift money<br/>\ninto savings usually too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry it&#39;s hard.  I feel the same way and wish I never had to tell<br/>\nhim I didn&#39;t have the money for something he wanted.  We do often<br/>\nbrainstorm about what we could do without, a trade out thing in order to<br/>\nget the thing he wants most.   We almost never feel bad about putting<br/>\ntofu back and eating beans so he can have a case of Coke. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the dollar for each year of age each week,  we pay monthly because<br/>\nthat&#39;s how David gets paid.  At twelve he&#39;s getting  about fifty dollars<br/>\na month now, when David&#39;s working, and a good portion of that goes into<br/>\nhis savings account.
