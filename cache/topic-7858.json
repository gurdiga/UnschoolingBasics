On a day when a 16 year old who has been<br/>\nsheltered has run away, my 19 year old who has enjoyed huge amounts <br/>\nof freedom<br/>\nchose<br/>\nto sit down (in the restaurant where he&#39;s employed) after his shift <br/>\nended<br/>\nwith me, his sister, and another unschooling family and talk for <br/>\nnearly an hour,<br/>\n<br/>\neven though there were cooler people, and friends his age, in the <br/>\nrestaurant.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren cannot choose to be with their families if they have no <br/>\nchoice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationships parents have with their children ARE important to <br/>\nthe<br/>\nchildren&#39;s growth, learning and safety. In not keeping my children <br/>\nsheltered,<br/>\nI<br/>\nhave children who voluntarily come home every night. A life of <br/>\npressure,<br/>\nnagging, pushing, guilt and sheltering has resulted in a teen who <br/>\nwould rather<br/>\nrisk the dangers of traveling alone than to stay home. If running <br/>\naway seems<br/>\nsafer and freer than being at home, perhaps there should have been a <br/>\nsafer,<br/>\nfreer way for that family to live.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I knew where Michael Thompson was and that he was safe, I would <br/>\njust write<br/>\nto his parents and tell them so. I&#39;d probably send them some <br/>\nunschooling<br/>\nlinks, and then get a hateful e-mail, and that would be that. I <br/>\nwould not call<br/>\n<br/>\nthe sheriff and help them return them to his parents, who make him <br/>\nwork and<br/>\nmake him feel giuilty that they gave up careers and professional <br/>\nsuccess for<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I do feel for his parent&#39;s and their fears, and I hope he&#39;s <br/>\nwell and<br/>\nthat he contacts them, I hope the situation can be resolved without <br/>\nhim being<br/>\nforced back into the same situation (or worse, as sometimes happens <br/>\nwhen<br/>\nrunaways return and are then grounded and shamed).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8054,"nextTopicId":7918}}
