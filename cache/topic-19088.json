I don&#39;t see this as one person has to completely give up<br/>\nwhat one wants.  I see this as somoene having to help her family make<br/>\ndecisions on how we can best reach everyone&#39;s wants and needs where we<br/>\nare now.  Sometimes that means that we have to prioritize everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds/wants.  Who is to say that the person going to the store won&#39;t<br/>\ndecide that the store isn&#39;t that important right now as his/her<br/>\nsibling really just needs to cuddle with mom and that person remembers<br/>\nhow important cuddle time was for him/her the last time s/he was sick.<br/>\n I see nothing wrong with asking someone else to wait on something in<br/>\nconsideration of another person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently went through this.

School was still in session and she would have the park to<br/>\nherself mostly.  This weekend we made a point of going to the nautre<br/>\ntrail.

I  would <br/>\nnot say that the &quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person&#39;s need for me to be there is more  <br/>\nimportant that the store is for the other person.  To them it might  not be more <br/>\nimportant.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust as an example, because you threw them out there.  This is where  I think <br/>\nwhen you are in a mindset of compromise and already believe that someone  <br/>\nwill give up something, you would only see maybe a couple of solutions.   Maybe <br/>\nthe person feeling cruddy will have mom by their side and the store will  wait. <br/>\n OR  one person will get to go to best buy while the other gives  up the park <br/>\nor the park instead of best buy.  etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf it were me we would talk about the store and the  cruddy feeling.  Maybe <br/>\nit would be fine for the &quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person if  someone he knew came over <br/>\nfor a few minutes and sat with him while I took  &quot;another&quot; person to the store <br/>\nfor a few minutes.  Maybe dad can take a few  minutes off his lunch break to <br/>\neither pick up whatever it is at the store or  come home to sit with the <br/>\n&quot;cruddy feeling&quot; person.  Maybe dad could pick it  up on his way home or we could <br/>\ngo out after dad gets home.  Maybe a friend  could go to the store.  etc, etc.  <br/>\nNo one HAS to give up what they  want, and when you know there is a solution <br/>\nout there and are used to working  toward it, more possibilities and solutions <br/>\nshow up.  I know my boys are  both good at working out very creative <br/>\nsolutions. You tend to not get stuck and  say &quot;there is no solution to this problem so <br/>\none of us must give up  something&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe second situation you mentioned with Best Buy and the  park, we might look <br/>\nat our schedule to see if either something we are doing  before or after can <br/>\nbe moved to &quot;make&quot; more time for Best Buy and the Park, we  might want to come <br/>\nback to either one after we do whatever that is limiting our  time, it is <br/>\nnear the holidays stores are staying open later maybe we could do  what ever else <br/>\nthere is to do and then come back to town to go out to supper and  hang at <br/>\nBest Buy (we love Best Buy here&gt;&gt;&gt;:-))  Maybe what we want  at Best Buy can be <br/>\nordered or looked at online so it will only take a minute or  no time in the <br/>\nstore.  Maybe a friend can come by with her kids and take  one to the park while <br/>\nI go with the other to Best Buy and then swing by the park  after to pick <br/>\nthat person up.  Maybe the other way around, maybe one would  like to hang with a <br/>\nfriend and his mom at Best Buy while I take the other person  to the park.  <br/>\nMaybe since we do have limited time we would postpone both  until the next day <br/>\nwhen we have much more time and can do both for as long as we  like.   etc.  <br/>\nMany, many more options than just one person must  sacrifice what they want to <br/>\ndo.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway those are just a couple of examples.  And  those are some of the <br/>\nthings people bring to the CL list. Situations they  may feel stuck in, that having <br/>\nanother perspective on things may  open up more possible solutions and gets <br/>\nyou back in the right mind  set.  I think we all have times when we just don&#39;t <br/>\nsee a solution,  sometimes we are too close, too invested in a certain outcome <br/>\nmaybe.  But  no one is perfect and it does help to bounce things off of other <br/>\npeople.   It helps to see others working out different solutions even if the <br/>\nsame thing  isn&#39;t happening in your home.  And it works in a variety of homes, <br/>\nthere  are people on that list who are not even homeschoolers and a couple <br/>\nwho don&#39;t  even have children.  <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: CL","postDate":"1164151609","msgId":19187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVrMDF2cCtrZ2d1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ1NjM3MDg5LjIwNzAwMDFAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19185,"nextInTopic":19191,"prevInTime":19186,"nextInTime":19188,"topicId":19088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~See, I don t see this as compromise or concession. *shrug*~~ YEah, but it feels like it to the child that wanted X right NOW and chose to wait so the other","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1125821686\">~See, I don&#39;t see this as compromise or concession. *shrug*~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYEah, but it feels like it to the child that wanted X right NOW and<br/>\nchose to wait so the other person could have Z.

I can not do<br/>\nthat for another. I don&#39;t prioritize that my needs are of a &quot;higher<br/>\npriority&quot; (more important) than another&#39;s. So, I agree, that<br/>\nconsensual solutions do not &quot;prioritize&quot; one person&#39;s needs above<br/>\nanother&#39;s. We work to create solutions where Everyone&#39;s wants and<br/>\nneeds are equally valid, discussed, considered and addressed. No one&#39;s<br/>\nneeds are a &quot;higher priority&quot;. I believe in *consensus* &quot;everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds are addressed&quot;. Compromise, generally implies mutual<br/>\nconcessions.

The\r<br/>\n&gt; ones that were pissed off and unwilling to negotiate sat and waited\r<br/>\n&gt; (Trevor). It all worked out, but it wasn&#39;t some parental compromise\r<br/>\n&gt; decided FOR anyone. We&#39;re all part of the process......I still see\r<br/>\n&gt; compromise being part of the method of coming to mutually agreeable\r<br/>\n&gt; soluations. Maybe it&#39;s a word choice...I don&#39;t know. I know I&#39;ve\r<br/>\n&gt; &quot;given up&quot; certain things over the years by choice. If it really\r<br/>\n&gt; bothered me I&#39;d find another soluation. I don&#39;t think giving up some\r<br/>\n&gt; sleep for my baby is a bad thing...in fact, I really LOVED that\r<br/>\n&gt; snuggly nursing time at night, though my body desperately needed sleep\r<br/>\n&gt; at times.\r<br/>\n&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, for me, in this nicely detailed description, it would be a matter \r<br/>\nof word choice. To me, in this instance, it&#39;s not about &quot;compromise&quot; but \r<br/>\nabout &quot;prioritizing.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nNo, in every situation, people aren&#39;t going to be able to have every \r<br/>\nneed, desire, want met. And maybe this is where TCS (taking children \r<br/>\nseriously) folks get worked up over the notion of &quot;core needs.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSometimes we might have multiple needs: a need to sit in the coolest \r<br/>\nplace in the van, a need to sit next to our momentary favorite person, a \r<br/>\nneed for peace and quiet. All of those needs may not be able to be met \r<br/>\nat the same moment, which then requires a need for prioritization of needs.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSometimes people who emphasize taking children seriously emphasize the \r<br/>\nneed to take the initial expression of need/ want/ desire at its surface \r<br/>\nvalue. I agree with that to a large degree when the alternative means \r<br/>\ndismissing that surface expression for a need/ want/ desire that the \r<br/>\nperson doesn&#39;t consent to having: i.e. my child is pitching a fit \r<br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t want a nap, but I, as his parent, can better judge \r<br/>\nhis need than he can.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nBut, I don&#39;t agree that our initial need/ want/ desire is always the \r<br/>\nmost accurate expression of our underlying need/ want/ desire. I think, \r<br/>\nrather, that there&#39;s often a knee-jerk/ reactionary/ defensive quality \r<br/>\nto our initial expressions that further investigation/ brainstorming/ \r<br/>\nintrospection can excavate (ooh, that&#39;s a dirty rhetorical trick because \r<br/>\nI know Ren respects the action of excavating).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDoes that make any sense? Does that clarify things any? (And again, I \r<br/>\nmay be totally muddying the waters somewhere in between what Ren and Pam \r<br/>\nand Pat are trying to express.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;\r<br/>\n&gt; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- \r<br/>\n~~Danielle\r<br/>\nEmily (9), Julia (7), Sam (6)\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] CL","postDate":"1164086793","msgId":19163,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2YS4zOGIxYWY0ZS4zMjkzZTgwOUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19158,"nextInTopic":19176,"prevInTime":19162,"nextInTime":19164,"topicId":19088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/2006 10:05:54 PM Eastern Standard Time, unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com writes: I m  reading the CL stuff and thinking but do they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2114050601\">In a message dated 11/20/2006 10:05:54 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m  reading the CL stuff and thinking<br/>\n&quot;but do they have a family of 6 with at  least one child dealing with<br/>\nsensory/processing issues??&quot;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI personally do not.

And maybe this is where TCS (taking children <br/>\nseriously) folks get worked up over the notion of &quot;core needs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we might have multiple needs:  a need to sit in the coolest <br/>\nplace in the van, a need to sit next to our momentary favorite person, a <br/>\nneed for peace and quiet. All of those needs may not be able to be met <br/>\nat the same moment, which then requires a need for prioritization of needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people who emphasize taking children seriously emphasize the <br/>\nneed to take the initial expression of need/ want/ desire at its surface <br/>\nvalue. I agree with that to a large degree when the alternative means <br/>\ndismissing that surface expression for a need/ want/ desire that the <br/>\nperson doesn&#39;t consent to having: i.e. my child is pitching a fit <br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t want a nap, but I, as his parent, can better judge <br/>\nhis need than he can.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I don&#39;t agree that our initial need/ want/ desire is always the <br/>\nmost accurate expression of our underlying need/ want/ desire.

Like Ren if I were to have to work through to a consensual<br/>\nagreement everytime we left the house we would never get out of the<br/>\ndriveway.  So we have compromised by agreeing that everyone gets a<br/>\nturn throughout the trip.  We rotate at different stops.  It does mean<br/>\nthat someone has to give up those things that are important for them<br/>\nevery third stop (and you wouldn&#39;t believe some of the stops I have<br/>\ncreated to make sure everyone got a chance up front.)  It&#39;s working<br/>\nfor us and everyone feels valued at having their needs met at least a<br/>\nthird of the time while we are out and about.  Everyone feels that<br/>\ntheir need is as important as the next person&#39;s, but I don&#39;t have a<br/>\ndouble wide car to accomodate everyone&#39;s need to be up front all the<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think of our &quot;cat box compromise.&quot;  No one likes doing the cat<br/>\nbox.  Everyone loves the cats.  We&#39;ve agreed that we will each take a<br/>\nturn rotating whose day it is (we do it by age, just so we remember<br/>\nwhose day it is) It makes for three happy cats and five people who<br/>\nknow that they only have to do the cat box every fifth day.

I see giving to and  for others something that is<br/>\nhealthy when done for the right  reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think parents SHOULD give up some of their own needs in  order<br/>\nto meet the needs of their child. That&#39;s part of being a parent.  My<br/>\nvery real NEED for sleep is not as important as a babies need  to<br/>\nnurse. I see it as giving my child what they need, my CHOICE and yet  I<br/>\nignore my biological need for sleep to do that.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou know, I really think it is great that you have worked out  solutions that <br/>\nyou and your family are happy with.  I just know that there  are other <br/>\nsolutions, as well, that do not involve &quot;giving up&quot; what you  want.  We have <br/>\ndiscussed, a couple of times, the sleep issue as well as the  pet issue.  It is <br/>\namazing, when you start throwing out different solutions  and don&#39;t think someone <br/>\nhas to  &quot;give up&quot; what they want, how  creative people can be.  It just makes <br/>\nme smile each and every time to see  how people can think so far outside the <br/>\nbox.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor some people &quot;giving up&quot; what they want leaves them feeling empty or  <br/>\ntaken advantage of, and they then feel guilty.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: CL","postDate":"1164069501","msgId":19121,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqdGhwdCtzZGE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqdGc4Nys1NmgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19118,"nextInTopic":19124,"prevInTime":19120,"nextInTime":19122,"topicId":19088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~When there is a decision maker creating a compromise, it is different than if everyone has equal authority, for instance. ~~ Aha, maybe this is where I m","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-774561709\">~~When there is a decision maker creating a<br/>\ncompromise, it is different than if everyone has equal authority, for<br/>\ninstance. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nAha, maybe this is where I&#39;m having a communication breakdown.<br/>\nCompromise is not decided by me or dh (the only time I really step in<br/>\nto stop something is over safety, and then we discuss how to approach<br/>\nthe situation together to solve whatever issue is there). Compromise<br/>\nhere is reached by discussion of all parties involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood example;  We all drove a friend home this evening. Jalen was<br/>\nsitting in back with friend and a brother until we dropped the friend<br/>\noff. The boys were frustrated with his intensity and very loud voice<br/>\nand wanted to move up front (our van has 8 seats, 3 in the far back)<br/>\nto get away from him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen was pissed off that they moved up because he probably felt a bit<br/>\nrejected and he wanted to sit by Trevor. Trevor wanted to be as far<br/>\naway from him as possible. We sat in the driveway for a good 5 minutes<br/>\ndiscussing options;<br/>\nTrading seats with Sierra, sitting up front and having Daddy move to<br/>\nthe back, sitting in the middle between Jared and Trevor etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was initially screaming so much that every option just pissed him<br/>\noff. So we sat. We waited. We offered options for everyone. Other kids<br/>\ncame up with their own options. He finally calms down enough to really<br/>\nhear. Markus moves to the back and Jalen gets the front seat which<br/>\nmade for a calm and quiet ride  home.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery person discussed options. The people willing to move in order to<br/>\nmake it work, offered up their seats (Sierra, Markus and Jared). The<br/>\nones that were pissed off and unwilling to negotiate sat and waited<br/>\n(Trevor). It all worked out, but it wasn&#39;t some parental compromise<br/>\ndecided FOR anyone. We&#39;re all part of the process......I still see<br/>\ncompromise being part of the method of coming to mutually agreeable<br/>\nsoluations.  Maybe it&#39;s a word choice...I don&#39;t know. I know I&#39;ve<br/>\n&quot;given up&quot; certain things over the years by choice. If it really<br/>\nbothered me I&#39;d find another soluation. I don&#39;t think giving up some<br/>\nsleep for my baby is a bad thing...in fact, I really LOVED that<br/>\nsnuggly nursing time at night, though my body desperately needed sleep<br/>\nat times.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: CL","postDate":"1164068351","msgId":19114,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVqdGdsdisybmVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOERCMTRFNTM4NEM1Ny03REMtMjU1NkBNQkxLLU0zOC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":19111,"nextInTopic":19118,"prevInTime":19113,"nextInTime":19115,"topicId":19088,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ You ll argue heartily about the difference between teach and learn.
