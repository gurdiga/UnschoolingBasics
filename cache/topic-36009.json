I had to comment.  School does a lot less than the above.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went through all of high school, community college (2 year) and 2<br/>\nuniversities.  I got a diploma and a BA degree.  Granted, I hated school<br/>\n(except Kindergarten and 1st & 2nd grade) until I got to ETSU in Tennessee.<br/>\nEven there, people were telling me an art degree would be useless.  I felt<br/>\nthat an English degree would be a dead end for me.  Good thing I listened to<br/>\nme.  I found painting, sculpture, metalworking, bookmaking, fiber art,<br/>\nprintmaking, just to name a few.  I had a hard time picking a concentration<br/>\nbecause I didn&#39;t like the painting area&#39;s professor&#39;s painting style or way<br/>\nof talking to the students... awful critiquing methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn grade school and high school I wanted to write but never did.  School is<br/>\nall about boring busy work that doesn&#39;t prepare a student to do what they&#39;re<br/>\ninterested in.  It keeps them occupied until the day they can finally take<br/>\nup important work.  Usually that means forget about your interests in favor<br/>\nof working a dead end job of little interest to oneself.  I didn&#39;t have time<br/>\nor mental space to think about having comic book output.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was lucky.  Somehow I was able to ignore the voices telling me *not* to<br/>\nfollow my interests and did what I wanted to do.  That&#39;s not typical.

All the usual reasons...it would decrease <br/>\nher attention span, turn her into a zombie, etc, affect her like all <br/>\nthe studies say.  I am getting better at not panicking about it <br/>\nthough, although once a year or so I have my moments, LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to really stop and think about what others were saying and see <br/>\nit was true in my own situation too...<br/>\n<br/>\n1)Dd does not LITERALLY watch it all day (Sandra Dodd does a good job <br/>\nat her site with talking about people who make broad all or nothing <br/>\nstatements like this...we say this stuff like it is actually <br/>\nliterally true).  She does other things too...comic book creating, <br/>\ncomputer games, is more than willing to go out with me and ds/dh and <br/>\ndo other stuff, read, etc.  The TV is just one more thing, very <br/>\nattractive to her because she is a VERY visually oriented person in <br/>\nher learning, and remembers EVERYTHING she sees.  I can see that in <br/>\nso many areas in how she learns (I am convinced that allowing her <br/>\ninterest in the computer and playing on Starfall.com with her plus of <br/>\ncourse her brain being ready was a major factor in reading clicking <br/>\nfor her!) She also is big into computer right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)I think the biggest advice I took from all those pro TV unschoolers <br/>\nwas to just swallow my fear (hard at first) and look at TV as a <br/>\nbonding time with her.  Now it is nice to sit and just cuddle on the <br/>\ncouch and watch, instead of looking at her thinking she is <br/>\ndoing &quot;nothing&quot;.  When I sit and watch with her, so many questions <br/>\nand connections and learning moments come up and it can branch into <br/>\nso many things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3)Like others have said elsewhere in cyberspace, the TV studies are <br/>\ndone on schooled children, who may need an escape after all that <br/>\nschool.  Also, no indication of if a parent is watching mindfully <br/>\nwith them or if they are plunked in front of it.  I also wonder <br/>\nin &quot;those studies&quot; how it is possible they watch 4-5 hours a day when <br/>\nthey have school to go to!<br/>\n<br/>\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, I think the biggest thing I found, when I really <br/>\nexamined my thoughts about tv, was that the times when I worried or <br/>\nfound myself thinking that she does nothing all day but watch tv, was <br/>\nthat I felt this way because I hadn&#39;t truly taken time to connect <br/>\nwith her and BE with her...like being in the house and she does her <br/>\nthing and I am doing mine.  She was getting grumpy about lack of <br/>\nconnection, and I was about the TV  The TV was just a convienient <br/>\nscapegoat for those feelings.  We have started making a list each <br/>\nmorning of 3-4 things that she wants to do with me that day. It has <br/>\nbeen anything from playing our board games, to going to the library, <br/>\nto baking cookies, to working on her comic strips, and yes, to <br/>\nwatching Fairly OddParents together or playing on Poptropica <br/>\ntogether.  Focusing on our relationship and just BEING together in <br/>\nany activity including tv and computer is what is healing me from <br/>\nthose feelings that she &quot;isn&#39;t learning anything&quot; or unschooling <br/>\nisn&#39;t working.  Yes, she is 8 and her only writing output is comic <br/>\nstrips, or she doesn&#39;t like workbook math and is only JUST getting <br/>\ncomfortable playing the odd game, and maybe she would look miore like <br/>\na schooled kid (unfortunatley whose writing experiences say, are <br/>\ncoerced in many cases not done because it has meaning to them) in <br/>\nthese areas if she didn&#39;t watch tv, but her life is rich and full and <br/>\nshe is making her own unique learning connections, even if through <br/>\nasking questions about what is on TV and then we get a book, or I see <br/>\nit in her and ds imaginary play together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps any doubters or anyone on this journey of <br/>\ndeschooling our assumptions about tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina here in Manitoba Canada mom to Stephanie (8) and Jonathan (5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tammy Brock&quot; &lt;tammy@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am currently listening to a book where this topic comes up and it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>bothered<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; me so I wanted to see what others have to say on the subject.

I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t get the whole sleeping in silence thing. I have lived in a variety of<br/>\nlocations urban, rural, really rural. Heck I have even hitch hiked around<br/>\nthe country and slept in a bunch of weird places. I have never found<br/>\nanywhere to be silent. In fact it is rarely ever quiet. We live in a small<br/>\ntown, population 500, maybe its 501 idk. We rarely have cars pass after dark<br/>\nbut there is always noise of some sort. There are animals domestics and<br/>\nfarm. we even have skunks from time to time but they aren&#39;t noisy :-) Still<br/>\nit isn&#39;t silent. You would need to put ear things on to cover all noise. I<br/>\nam much more impressed that my kids can fall asleep anywhere, really<br/>\n*anywhere*. I use to take my dd in a sling to music shows starting when she<br/>\nwas tiny. She would fall asleep to thundering punk rock music, sweet and<br/>\ncontent. She and I traveled around in our truck for a bit and she<br/>\nwould/could fall asleep anywhere doing anything. Sleep was just what you do<br/>\nwhen you are tired, she didn&#39;t need anything more than me (then). For a<br/>\ncouple years she would fall asleep most nights watching TV, it relaxed her.<br/>\nNow she prefers to read.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very unschoolish to impose your <br/>\nopinions onto your children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion of tv?  It&#39;s just another thing in our day.  I <br/>\ngive it no more or less importance than anything else we do.  Yes, <br/>\nthere are some tv shows I don&#39;t care to watch.  Each of my family <br/>\nmembers has preferences for tv shows.  We also have preferences for <br/>\nbooks, comics, food, drinks, music, games, movies, playing, working, <br/>\nand any number of other topics!  I can&#39;t imagine withholding anything <br/>\nfrom my children simply because it is something I don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For that reason, I have forbidden TVs in my kids rooms, I think<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in silence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Forbidden?  Again, you&#39;re imposing your opinion and preference onto <br/>\nyour children.  I don&#39;t fall asleep to the tv, but neither do I like <br/>\nfalling asleep in absolute silence.  It&#39;s unnerving and is a major <br/>\nsource of discomfort and distraction.  I believe in each person being <br/>\nable to choose how to fall asleep and respecting those choices even <br/>\nif they aren&#39;t the same as mine.  The issue between your husband and <br/>\nyourself is simply another opportunity for people needing to learn to <br/>\ncompromise.  It sounds like you don&#39;t want your children to become <br/>\nused to falling asleep to the tv because in the future they may be <br/>\nmarried to someone who doesn&#39;t like falling asleep the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you value your quiet time as you fall asleep because it&#39;s a <br/>\ntime of reflection and peace for you.  But that doesn&#39;t mean you can <br/>\nget your children to feel the same way.  This is just another one of <br/>\nthose things that they&#39;ll grow up knowing is Mom&#39;s thing and then <br/>\nwill move out and do their own thing.  Why does it even have to be a <br/>\nthing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I realize that my value-ing of that quiet time doesn&#39;t make me any<br/>\n&gt; better or worse than him, and that my efforts to keep my kids from<br/>\n&gt; turning into &quot;sleeping TV addicts&quot; is one-sided and maybe his mom<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t create that, maybe she did- either way, it has nothing to<br/>\n&gt; do with my kids.  I don&#39;t love him any less for it. <br/>\n&gt; Lisa<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re not being honest with yourself.  Above, you said <br/>\nyou&#39;ve forbidden tvs in your children&#39;s rooms because of your <br/>\nperception that your DH is a tv addict.  If it has nothing to do with <br/>\nthe kids, why are you not giving them a chance to make their own <br/>\nchoices the way you&#39;ve been able to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my last thought is why you feel tv is an addiction.  What about <br/>\nother things that some people do a great deal of time because they <br/>\npersonally enjoy it?  Some people exercise hours a day.  Some people <br/>\nread hours a day.  Some people garden hours a day.  Some people watch <br/>\ntv hours a day.  Again, tv is just another thing to do in a day.  I <br/>\nhave seen this debate countless times and someone always posts web <br/>\nlinks to studies that tv watching is not as harmful as others <br/>\nbelieve.  I don&#39;t have those links but they&#39;re likely easy to find if <br/>\nyou care to look.  I personally think it&#39;s just another thing that <br/>\nsome parents like to control because they can.  I met a woman at a <br/>\nhomeschool park day who was very proud of herself for forbidding her <br/>\nchildren to read books in bed pretty much for the same reason you&#39;ve <br/>\nforbidden tv.  I suppose that&#39;s her thing.

The kids feel the same way about CNN.<br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a fan of either of those types of show, personally. There <br/>\nare some shows I enjoy watching with the kids, others I say &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>\nreally like this one&quot; and go do something else. Sometimes, if one of <br/>\nmy kids is really excited about a particular show, I&#39;ll watch more <br/>\nof it. If I *really* can&#39;t stand it, I&#39;ll look it up online <br/>\n(Wikipedia is good for this), get an idea of who the characters are, <br/>\nthe main themes, background, whatever - just get myself some more <br/>\ninformation so I can share my kid&#39;s excitement and talk with him or <br/>\nher about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve ended up enjoying some shows more than I expected - Total Drama <br/>\nIsland for instance, or Family Guy. Others I just can&#39;t get into - <br/>\nEd, Edd and Eddy, for example, and Drake and Josh for that matter. <br/>\nOne thing I have noticed is that its important for me to watch the <br/>\nshow for Me - not as The Parent - does that make sense? If I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking &quot;do *I* like this?&quot; I will sometimes feel very differently <br/>\nthan if I&#39;m thinking &quot;is this a good show for my child to watch?&quot; My <br/>\nkids are pretty savvy - they know what they like, what disturbs <br/>\nthem, what scares them. I can&#39;t &quot;know&quot; that for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;how dare you deny them the one major form of communication of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>their generation, let them watch it as much as they want and decide <br/>\nfor themselves what is and isn&#39;t stupid, they just might like that <br/>\ncrap and could possibly use it to make the world a better place&quot;<br/>\n***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed something really interesting when we switched from having <br/>\njust Netflix to just satellite (we can&#39;t afford both at the moment). <br/>\nIts a different experience watching a whole season of something in <br/>\none fell swoop as opposed to in weekly installments. It reminded me <br/>\nof the way Charles Dickens originally wrote in installments, but we <br/>\n*read* his works, today, as complete entities. With that in mind <br/>\n(and these days, writers of serial shows have that in mind!) its not <br/>\nterribly realistic to look at a single episode of something and make <br/>\ndecisions about the work as a whole. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know, I know, some folks are probably rolling their eyes at a <br/>\ncomparison of Dickens to CSI or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The point <br/>\nI&#39;m getting to, in a rather roundabout manner, is that tv functions <br/>\nin some of the same ways as literature. Its not identical, by any <br/>\nmeans, but I honestly don&#39;t think its worse. I&#39;ve certainly had more <br/>\nthoughtful, insightful conversations with both my kids about tv <br/>\nprograms than anything either one of them has read. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they just might like that crap and could possibly use it to make <br/>\n&gt;the world a better place<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, I&#39;m not a fan of that type of show. Something that <br/>\nfacinates me, though, is the way some &quot;non-fiction&quot; shows are <br/>\nstarting to dovetail with the internet. Mythbusters, for example, <br/>\nnot only solicits ideas from watchers, but has message boards where <br/>\nfolks can discuss and debate the science behind various concepts - <br/>\nsome of which come to the show, others not. Its an interesting <br/>\nphenomenon - some aspects of tv are actually becoming more <br/>\ninteractive over time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I think it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to chuckle over this. I live deep in the country - <br/>\nthe &quot;hills&#39;n&#39;hollers&quot; of TN. Three quarters of the year, there&#39;s no <br/>\nsuch thing as silence in the evenings. The frogs and crickets and <br/>\ncicadas and catydids and owls and wood pigeons create quite the <br/>\nracket! With that in mind - maybe its the need for silence that&#39;s <br/>\nmore abnormal. It may be completely adaptive to *need* a background <br/>\nof sounds to fall asleep - lets you know those nocturnal predators <br/>\naren&#39;t sneaking up on you or something ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7yo used to fall asleep with the tv on nightly - when she was 3-<br/>\n5. But she&#39;s since switched to turning the tv off when she&#39;s ready <br/>\nto go to sleep. I&#39;ve gone through phases where I couldn&#39;t get to <br/>\nsleep without the radio on, or couldn&#39;t get to sleep without reading <br/>\nfor at least an hour, or knitting, or doing yoga. Weird. But maybe <br/>\nreassuring to you. Not only is that sort of thing different for <br/>\ndifferent people, it can change.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: tv, video games, etc","postDate":"1221841816","msgId":36057,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdiMGsybytydWZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3NDcyNy45MjQ2MC5xbUB3ZWIzNzkwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36051,"nextInTopic":36062,"prevInTime":36056,"nextInTime":36058,"topicId":36009,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~~They still choose stupid things (Drake & Josh) and they love it, and I have tried to watch WITH them, but I just can t enjoy Drake & Josh.~~~ My friends","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1283848374\">~~~They still choose stupid things (Drake & Josh) and they love it,<br/>\nand I have tried to watch WITH them, but I just can&#39;t enjoy Drake &<br/>\nJosh.~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends tease me because they know I have a crush on Drake Bell.

He was almost 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then we have seen bits and pieces of shows and the kids have chosen not to like <br/>\nthem for whatever reason.

Superman and the Justice League, Spiderman, The Tick (how can you <br/>\nnot like that old goofy cartoon!

They still choose stupid things (Drake & Josh) and they love it, and I have tried to watch WITH them, but I just can&#39;t enjoy Drake & Josh.  The kids feel the same way about CNN.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m interested in seeing the media debate here, since I obviously have several opposing opinions about the matter, and CNN is owned by a big corporation, too so it&#39;s not really &quot;unbiased news&quot; anyway, is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s mom was a &quot;neat freak&quot; who yelled at the kids all day long to clean, and plugged them into TV so they wouldn&#39;t make messes.  He &quot;needs&quot; the TV on to fall asleep, he&#39;s had one in his room since he was born, and he doesn&#39;t even watch it, but he &quot;needs&quot; the flashing lights and sound.  I on the other hand, have to lay a pillow over my head because the flashing lights make it hard for me to sleep and so does the sound.  For that reason, I have forbidden TVs in my kids rooms, I think it&#39;s nearly a disorder to be unable to fall asleep in silence.  In my mind, that silence is perfect peacefulness, a time to reflect upon the day, think deep thoughts, deliberately relax my body, and create intentions for the next day.  I absolutely cherish the 10-15 minutes of &quot;falling asleep&quot; time, and sometimes I&#39;ll ask my husband to come to bed later than me, so I can have that time to myself.  Usually, though I watch TV with him and lay a pillow over my head when<br/>\n I&#39;ve had enough of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that my value-ing of that quiet time doesn&#39;t make me any better or worse than him, and that my efforts to keep my kids from turning into &quot;sleeping TV addicts&quot; is one-sided and maybe his mom didn&#39;t create that, maybe she did- either way, it has nothing to do with my kids.
