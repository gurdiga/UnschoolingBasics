As<br/>\nhard as I&#39;ve tried, I don&#39;t think my mother approves,<br/>\nbut she can accept it.  My dad does much better with<br/>\nit.  I still think they feel we&#39;re making a big<br/>\nmistake, but after all my kids have been through, I<br/>\ncan&#39;t with a clean conscience put them back in public<br/>\nschool.  It&#39;s done too much damage to them, that we<br/>\nare still working on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will definately be a support person for you. <br/>\nAnytime you need to talk, you can email me off list,<br/>\nif you would like.   I know how hard it is.  I have a<br/>\ncouple of friends, that will ask how things are going,<br/>\nand how the kids are.  They both know that we<br/>\nhomeschool, but know nothing about the unschooling. <br/>\nFor us, the unschooling fits our lifestyle better, and<br/>\nthe kids are more at ease.  They still learn, but<br/>\nabout fun things they are interested in, not the<br/>\nthings that they are forced to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in-law is bad enough, where my kids don&#39;t<br/>\neven want to see her.  They came over a couple of<br/>\nyears ago for Christmas, and she made a nasty comment<br/>\nto me right infront of my son.  She had said she<br/>\nshould take a picture, and I thought maybe she was<br/>\ntalking about taking a picture of my son, but said she<br/>\nshould take a picture of my clean floor.  Since that<br/>\nday, they are not allowed in my house, unless I am not<br/>\nhome.  She constantly critcizes me, and offers advice<br/>\non how to do thing.  I am not living in a house that<br/>\nhas no dust, etc, but one that we are comfortable<br/>\nwith, and one that looks like people actually live<br/>\nhere. (her house is worse than mine, and there is only<br/>\ntwo of them there.)  She, along with my brother<br/>\nin-laws girlfriend were asking questions to my<br/>\ndaughter and son about what they were learning, and<br/>\nwhat books they are reading.  If they don&#39;t want to<br/>\nread, I don&#39;t make them.  They pretty much have free<br/>\nroam to do what they want, accept for a few things. <br/>\n(Sorry I am rambling, I understand what you are going<br/>\nthrough with you mil.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail me anytime, and I will answer as soon as I can. <br/>\nI haven&#39;t been to any conferences either.  They sounds<br/>\nintersting, but not sure when we can afford to go to<br/>\none.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, and I hope all goes well for you and your<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Maisha Khalfani &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maitai373@...\">maitai373@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Schafer Vanessa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psychomom95@...\">psychomom95@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   Can you stay with your mom?

I just say, that I love being with<br/>\nthem, and wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  Some of<br/>\nthese questions were fired at my kids at Christmas<br/>\ntime at my in-laws.  I wasn&#39;t there for obvious<br/>\nreasons, but I hate always being questioned.  For that<br/>\nreason alone, I never tell anyone that we unschool,<br/>\npartially because of the questions, but mainly because<br/>\nI know people from my family, and my husbands family,<br/>\nand friends wouldn&#39;t understand.  I just tell people<br/>\nthat the kids are happier than they&#39;ve ever been, and<br/>\nthat they are learning.  (sorry, I got off track).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing is that if you are happy, and your<br/>\nin-laws are nasty, then you don&#39;t need that kind of<br/>\nnegativity.  You are doing what is best for you and<br/>\nyour family.  If they can&#39;t see that, than to bad for<br/>\nthem, because they are missing out on really beautiful<br/>\nchildren, who are very much loved by their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck.<br/>\n--- Maisha Khalfani &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maitai373@...\">maitai373@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Joanne &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:billyandjoanne@...\">billyandjoanne@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m sorry to hear about your troubles.

I am always amazed at <br/>\nthe crap that my friends spew in explanation for how they treat their <br/>\nkids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always thought that my best friend was of a similar mindset but <br/>\nrecently I have watched as the spirit of her precious daughters  is <br/>\nbeing broken in the school system , as she just stands by, actually <br/>\nagreeing that they need to be taught these lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, I too feel very lonely.

My mom held out hope for a long time that we&#39;d<br/>\neventually move and find a wonderful school to enroll our children in.<br/>\nShe would make comments like, &quot;Sure, homeschooling is fine for now,<br/>\nbut when you find a good school...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I feel like it&#39;s me (and sometimes hubby when he&#39;s really on board) against the world.  My kids are chided for skipping, running, talking to loudly in my sil&#39;s house.  It&#39;s like they must be &quot;seen and not heard&quot;.  Khalid, my spirited almost 4 year old gets the brunt of the stress, I think.  He&#39;s trying to still be the baby like Khidar (who will be 2), and my mil and sil don&#39;t seem to get that.  He&#39;s not doing stuff &quot;on purpose&quot; to be disrespectful.  My mil and sil are *big* into that old-school parenting stuff of listening to an adult just because they are an adult.  UGH!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same thing here! You know, for a long time dh and I just had no idea<br/>\nthat there was a different way of raising children because all our<br/>\nlives we were surrounded with (and raised by) the old-school parenting<br/>\nmethods. It was definitely &quot;seen but not heard&quot; and punishment (rather<br/>\nthan understanding) was doled out regularly. By the time my sister and<br/>\nI were in early elementary school we&#39;d been trained to sit quietly on<br/>\na sofa, twiddling our thumbs and staring at the ceiling for an hour<br/>\nwhile the adults interacted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family doesn&#39;t understand that I don&#39;t want to raise my children<br/>\nthat way. Yes, I want them to have manners, etc, but not at the cost<br/>\nof their own voice and personality. My son is also 4 and very<br/>\nspirited! He is just an absolutely bundle of energy, is quite the<br/>\nthinker and talks aloud a lot. My parents&#39; house and my sister&#39;s house<br/>\nare not child-friendly and when the kids visit it&#39;s a whole scene<br/>\nabout how Alaska did this and Alaska did that and how he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nlisten and blah blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I might complain about my own child sometimes when I&#39;m feeling<br/>\nespecially overwhelmed but I don&#39;t want a list of things that are<br/>\nwrong with him from other people, you know? Especially when their main<br/>\ngoal is to get him to sit down and be quiet and all their complaints<br/>\nstem from his inability to do so. Rather than just seeing him as an<br/>\nexuberant, creative child with strong will and determination, they see<br/>\nhim as a problem child. And then look at me as if I&#39;ve done something<br/>\nwrong. They get upset when I try to explain or defend him, and<br/>\nsometimes I feel they&#39;d rather I just take their side and dislike my<br/>\nown kid. It took me a while to realize that their perception of him<br/>\nwas affecting MY perception of him. I had to get their voices out of<br/>\nmy head and see the joy in my child&#39;s personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should mention that my daughter is very laid back and spends long<br/>\nperiods of time being quiet, not because she&#39;s complying with them,<br/>\nbut because she enjoys time to herself and needs that quiet time. It&#39;s<br/>\nridiculous that one child is &quot;good&quot; and another &quot;trouble&quot; simply<br/>\nbecause they have two very different needs and personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   Sorry....I&#39;m just venting here because right now I want to go run away with my kids and dh and go homestead somewhere!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;re definitely not alone in your experiences! I try to look<br/>\nat like this: I&#39;m the forerunner, doing things a new way instead of<br/>\nraising children to be robots, trained to respond as programmed. I&#39;m<br/>\nparenting the first generation of kids in our family who will<br/>\nexperience life without school. I&#39;m breaking the cycle of using<br/>\nphysical punishment and heavy-handed child-rearing methods. It&#39;s not<br/>\neasy to be the one to shake things up and break new ground within a<br/>\nfamily that has done the same old thing without question for<br/>\ngenerations. It gets tiresome to constantly bump up against their<br/>\nbrick wall way of living and thinking. I sometimes I let their<br/>\nattitude slow down my attempts at learning to parent the way I want.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267954153,"authorName":"Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky","from":"&quot;Brian & Alexandra Polikowsky&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: feeling alone","postDate":"1169066235","msgId":20809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjcwMWM3M2E3NyRhODBiZTZlMCQ2NDU4YThjMEBPZmZpY2U+","referencesHeader":"PGVvbHZoNyttNzdzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20808,"nextInTopic":20810,"prevInTime":20808,"nextInTime":20810,"topicId":20802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"oH !

I won&#39;t even go into my family, my mom is <br/>\nconvinced that I am raising untrained beasts to rule our lives. Which is ironic considering <br/>\nhow awesome my kids are...and how much she resents my 26yo brother who still lives at <br/>\nhome. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were just having trouble last night, we have a weekly potluck at our house with friends <br/>\nthat we&#39;re very close to, three families from the church we used to attend. When I say <br/>\nclose, they are the families we were considering building a community with. One couple <br/>\nseems intent on &#39;training&#39; our Avari (14 months) to not climb on our coffee table or to <br/>\ntouch their drinks when they leave them in accessible places. The table is something that <br/>\nwe dont have a problem with, it&#39;s relatively safe, and she loves to jump off. We leave our <br/>\ndrinks where they can&#39;t be reached. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe  have in the past tended to parent each others children, and while this has never before <br/>\nbeen a problem, you can tell that their conventional parenting is leading to some <br/>\nproblems. When I asked one set of brothers if they would help tidy a path through the toys <br/>\nbefore dinner, they were pleased to help. The dad went ballistic though and threatened all <br/>\nsorts of punishments if they didn&#39;t do a good enough job. I was shocked. When they LEAVE <br/>\ntheir children here, we have no problems. I no longer leave my kids at their houses <br/>\nunattended however, because it has become too hard for the kids to handle. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just reminds me that yeah, we&#39;re pretty mucy alone. Even I desert myself sometimes and <br/>\nhave to remind myself of the path I&#39;ve chosen. I wish you the best though, and good luck. I <br/>\nread your blog and think you guys are doing so good, and just wish you the best to <br/>\ncontinue.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Maisha Khalfani &lt;maitai373@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure this is a redundant question given the nature of our lifestyles....but do you <br/>\n*sometimes* (LOL) feel alone in this?<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: feeling alone","postDate":"1169048371","msgId":20806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVvbGZ2aisxYnVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTE3MTIwNDAxLjMxNzM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMjA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20804,"nextInTopic":20808,"prevInTime":20805,"nextInTime":20807,"topicId":20802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I found it was much harder to feel confident in my parenting when my neighbors were staying in my home for a couple months.

They are <br/>\nwonderful people and &quot;theoretically&quot; like the idea of unschooling, but <br/>\nthe day to day details were new and overwhelming to them. I got a lot <br/>\nof quiet disapproval. George was affected a lot by that and started to <br/>\nfall back on a lot more &quot;traditional&quot; parenting techniques. I felt <br/>\nlike my parenting was being challenged all the time from every angle <br/>\nand that was really hard. Yuk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing in someone else&#39;s home with your kids must be even harder, <br/>\nespecially if things are still up in the air and you don&#39;t know how <br/>\nmuch longer y&#39;all will be there. Having a regular schedule was helpful <br/>\nfor *us* - just knowing *when* I was going to have to be more <br/>\nproactive and direct with Mo and when I would be able to relax helped <br/>\nme both to ration my energy and to adjust my expectations. It also <br/>\nhelped me to remind myself that it wouldn&#39;t be forever.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: feeling alone","postDate":"1169044295","msgId":20804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVvbGMwNytndjA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTE3MTIwNDAxLjMxNzM0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMjA3Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20802,"nextInTopic":20806,"prevInTime":20803,"nextInTime":20805,"topicId":20802,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m sorry to hear about your troubles.

Just to get them out of this stress that we&#39;ve been living in.  Now I understand that my mom has dr&#39;s appointments and such - that&#39;s understandable.  The kicker was when she said &quot;I can only keep them for a week or so.  I can&#39;t homeschool for a long period of time.  Are the schools there better than where you were before?&quot;  UGH!!!!!!  My response: &quot;I&#39;m not sending them to school for a babysitter, mom.  And that&#39;s what it would be.  And no, the schools here aren&#39;t better than where we were.&quot;   UGHHH!!!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  She *still* doesn&#39;t get that I&#39;m homeschool.  She definitely wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling.  To her it would just look like I&#39;m a negligent parent.  That&#39;s when it really hit me: she just doesn&#39;t get it.  None of my family does, and they probably won&#39;t.  And I felt soooo sad....and jealous of those of you who at least have a sibling that understands!  LOL.  My younger sister is a teacher and doesn&#39;t get it.  My younger brother...well....I think he would understand the concept, though he wouldn&#39;t get how it really works.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I feel like it&#39;s me (and sometimes hubby when he&#39;s really on board) against the world.  My kids are chided for skipping, running, talking to loudly in my sil&#39;s house.  It&#39;s like they must be &quot;seen and not heard&quot;.  Khalid, my spirited almost 4 year old gets the brunt of the stress, I think.  He&#39;s trying to still be the baby like Khidar (who will be 2), and my mil and sil don&#39;t seem to get that.  He&#39;s not doing stuff &quot;on purpose&quot; to be disrespectful.  My mil and sil are *big* into that old-school parenting stuff of listening to an adult just because they are an adult.  UGH!!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sorry....I&#39;m just venting here because right now I want to go run away with my kids and dh and go homestead somewhere!
