Just this summer my almost ten year old found a reason to<br/>\nwrite neatly (pen pals and pony club) and it&#39;s amazing how far she has come.<br/>\nShe stopped writing in all capital letters, began punctuating more, and made<br/>\ngreat strides in neatness.  I never made an issue out of her writing even<br/>\nthough when she was seven she wrote in all capitals and it was messy and it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t punctuated correctly.  Her spelling has also come naturally and I&#39;m<br/>\nstill amazed at how well both my girls spell without ever having a spelling<br/>\nlist or test.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the fun things she has done in the last few years include getting<br/>\nher own email account, dictating and writing a TON of stories, getting<br/>\npenpals (of which she has six now), spent a lot of time using Microsoft word<br/>\nand making forms and letters, writing in notebooks (I buy tons at the school<br/>\nsales for cheap and let them have at them). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUp until recently she always typed letters to pen pals.  Her penpals kept<br/>\nwriting back in long hand and it was much neater than her writing and it<br/>\ngave her the incentive to try to write more neatly.  The last couple letters<br/>\nto pen pals were written in long hand and I didn&#39;t even recognize the<br/>\nwriting, it was so neat.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"new unschooling parents need advice about writing","postDate":"1156650038","msgId":16815,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjcjQ3bStxZWFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16897,"prevInTime":16814,"nextInTime":16816,"topicId":16815,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"this child is seven!

Backwards letters and poor spelling are very<br/>\ncommon in young children. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree wholeheartedly!!<br/>\nLooking for a label and &quot;disablity&quot; in a 7y.o. child is NOT going to<br/>\nhelp unschooling blossom. It&#39;s VERY normal for young children to<br/>\nreverse letters. All of mine have done that so far, and not one of<br/>\nthem has had any problem at 13years of age. 13 seems to be the magic<br/>\nage for my boys.....Sierra is catching on a little bit earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nLetter reversal and poor handwriting is so normal and common. Heck, I<br/>\nhave terrible handwriting (I should have been a doctor I guess;) but I<br/>\ncan formulate an article and communicate ideas just fine (on a good<br/>\nday anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren need TIME. Time and development and help feeling comfortable<br/>\nwith exactly where they are at this very moment, with no comparisons<br/>\nto other children. THAT is the most helpful remedy for writing problems.<br/>\nNot all of us are meant to be writers anyway. I think I&#39;m going to<br/>\nstart labeling people with hang-ups about drawing and painting. I&#39;ll<br/>\ncall it dysartsia. I&#39;ll formulate a curriculum and therapy to help<br/>\npeople that are stuck creatively. I bet I can make millions teaching<br/>\npeople how to label their children &quot;dysartsic&quot; and convince them that<br/>\nit&#39;s a  horrible disability.
