I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what the problem is -- the notices made no sense<br/>\nto me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my state info:<br/>\n<br/>\nNew Mexico here - unschooling is very easy here, with<br/>\nonly a legal requirement that we register as<br/>\nhomeschoolers and the parent have a high school<br/>\ndiploma or equivalent.  In my experience, the<br/>\nrequirement is largely un-enforced, having been late<br/>\nin registering a couple of times.  I know other<br/>\nunschoolers here who never register, and never get<br/>\n&#39;found out.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to rating, probably a 9.5, maybe a 10. I understand<br/>\nthat in Oklahoma, there&#39;s not even a requirement to<br/>\nregister, and in Texas, one only has to establish a<br/>\nprivate school at the home address and anything else<br/>\nis okay from there.  Then again, I have no desire to<br/>\nlive in either OK or TX and I love NM, so that makes<br/>\nit<br/>\neasily a 10 in my book!<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nStart your day with Yahoo! - Make it your home page! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs\">http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"10"},"subject":"unschooling across the states","postDate":"1131430296","msgId":7595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2Q0RBRkJFLTNDQUUtNDZBQy05NjQ1LUVBQUU3NTcwNUY0M0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7600,"prevInTime":7594,"nextInTime":7596,"topicId":7595,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If your state is listed here, please write me a little blurb about how it works to UNSCHOOL in your state.
