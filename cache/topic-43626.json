I  <br/>\nthink once quite some time ago he said, lets go and play with some other  <br/>\nkids and we organized a meeting, other than that hes never mentioned it.   <br/>\nHe does get on well with kids and adults and he is spoken too and  <br/>\nacknowledged by all the people in the shops etc in our small town - it is  <br/>\ngood because they know us and he is responded to as a person rather than  <br/>\nan annoying child which can happen in cities etc. His socialization has  <br/>\ncome to my attention from people who would feel much better if he was in  <br/>\nschool.  Neither my husband or I have a problem with how he is with others  <br/>\n- he can be very protective with &#39;his belongings&#39; when other children come  <br/>\nto visit - he looks after his stuff and there are certain things that he  <br/>\ndoesnt want others to touch which we usually put up high.  He can be a bit  <br/>\nbossy however that is part of his nature, he is a typical Aries thats for  <br/>\nsure :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to answer your question, it is more other people getting at me, rather  <br/>\nthan us feeling he is missing out.  I believe that he has good social  <br/>\nskills.  He can be shy around forceful adults, but he is very friendly and  <br/>\nresponsive otherwise.  He has surprised me at how he will join in with  <br/>\nkids that he doesnt know in ball games etc when they become available.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your input as it has made me realise that I am feeling this  <br/>\nway due to other peoples comments and input rather than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nCamille  :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Socialization Question","postDate":"1270940365","msgId":43630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwcXZzZCttMnBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3NzIxNy4zMjgxNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTA4MTEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43629,"nextInTopic":43632,"prevInTime":43629,"nextInTime":43631,"topicId":43626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But in real life, that&#39;s not how people relate to one another, not even children. People form groups based on interests. Very young children often have similar interests due to development and a limited world-view, but by six most kids have distinct interests. Skype is a good idea (if its available to you) but might be better in relation to a shared interest of some kind - video games, for instance, are a big big point of connection for many people.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Socialization Question","postDate":"1270939788","msgId":43628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwcXZhYyttY2k1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwcXFvZStjbjQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43627,"nextInTopic":43629,"prevInTime":43627,"nextInTime":43629,"topicId":43626,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Many kids are perfectly happy having mostly older people to socialize with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts good to think about what you mean by &quot;socialization&quot;. Its kind of a throwaway word that gets used to mean &quot;kids should be in school&quot;! If he seems to need more time to socialize with more people, then by all means look for other ways for him to do that. If you&#39;re concerned that he needs to learn social skills, the best place to do that is at home, where he can have a chance to try out ways of getting along in a supportive environment.

He is happy, self assured and a gorgeous boy, he does get bored sometimes but has a wonderful imagination & always comes up with something to do out of anything he finds.  My question is socialization....  He has a hands on 19 yr old sister at home (plus Mum and Dad) and he sees people when we are at the shops etc and then has a playdate with 3 children 5,7,10 once a month who he loves playing with.  Is this sufficient socialization do you think???  <br/>\n<br/>\nUp until a year ago we went to church and he had socialization there, and bullying as well!!  However since then we have not had anymore than the once a month socialization with kids his own age.<br/>\nAre we disadvantaging him by only having this limited time with children?  I have had comments from friends, neighbours and family lately regarding his socialization.  He loves playing with the children and is always into it, usually glad when theyve gone and to have his space back as he needs that.  He doesnt ask to play more often - and its unlikely we could arrange it more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts please :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,  Camille</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43593,"nextTopicId":43594}}
