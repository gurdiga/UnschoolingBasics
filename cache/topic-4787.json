These people are much<br/>\n&gt; more highly motivated <br/>\n&gt; than the ones who are there because they are taking<br/>\n&gt; college courses <br/>\n&gt; because they think they &quot;have to&quot;.   They<br/>\n&gt; participate in class and do <br/>\n&gt; thoughtful work.

Many <br/>\n&gt; of the 18 year olds who are coming out of high<br/>\n&gt; school barely know how to <br/>\n&gt; write, usually don&#39;t come to class, and do the bare<br/>\n&gt; minimum of work <br/>\n&gt; required to get a C.

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-184725904\">Hi all,<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this list and thought I should introduce myself.  My name is Debbie, and I have been homeschooling my 13 yo dd for four years now.  My younger dd just began homeschooling this year (grade K).  Like many other people new to homeschooling, we went with a packaged curriculum the first year.  Trouble is, we&#39;ve been stuck in that rut ever since.  It seemed easier at first, having a program laid out for me, telling me what my kids need to do each week, etc., but now I realize that it is making life much more difficult than it needs to be.  We have finally reached a point where we are both (my older dd and I, that is) sick to death of this program and ready to learn more about unschooling.  Since she will begin high school level next school year, I&#39;m concerned about transcripts and a diploma, for college purposes.  How do you get around this?  Cafi Cohen&#39;s book &quot;Homeschooling:The Teen Years&quot; was recommended to me quite some time ago, and I still haven&#39;t checked it out yet - would any of you recommend it? or could you recommend a better book?<br/>\nMy younger daughter is using Oak Meadow&#39;s kindergarten curriculum, and it suits her well as there really isn&#39;t much to it so we supplement it by learning more about whatever she is interested in at the moment.  Today it was the moon.  Last week, she had a strong interest in learning about creatures that live in the ocean.  In fact, this way of &quot;schooling&quot; is what got me thinking that maybe unschooling would be a good fit for my kids after all.   LOL.<br/>\nMy older dd is also using OM materials (8th grade level).  The math is very, very good, but the rest of it is just so-so, and our biggest mistake was going with teacher support this year.  The OM teacher has been SOOOO strict, and even had the nerve to suggest that my dd&#39;s extracurricular activities are &quot;cutting into her OM studies too much&quot;!!!  I was outraged - to me, the extracurricular things are not &quot;fluff&quot; but real honest-to-goodness learning opportunies.  AND, the only things she goes to during the day is a Spanish class once a week (for one hour), and swimming with her friends at the Y once a week (not lessons, just swimming together for fun).   I complained to the OM teacher. Her reply was that she does this with all of her 8th graders to prepare them for the much more difficult/challenging high school years ahead.  Hmmmmm.....somehow, discouraging them doesn&#39;t seem like such a good idea to me.  A little praise would go a looooonnngggggg way, imo.<br/>\nAnyhow, as you can probably tell, we are ready for a change.<br/>\nIf you have gotten this far, thank you for listening.<br/>\nDebbie<br/>\nP.S.
