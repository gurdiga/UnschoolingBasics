My  <br/>\ndistrict has a school for deaf children from preschool through 6th  <br/>\ngrade. It is shares a site with another elementary school and all the  <br/>\nkids have art, pe, music, computer lab and assemblies and some other  <br/>\nstuff together. There are 38 children in the school and it has its own  <br/>\nprincipal, 7 teachers with specialty masters degrees, a full-time  <br/>\nspeech therapist, an audiologist, and 6 full-time aides.  They have a  <br/>\nlot of specialized equipment. The district is spending roughly in the  <br/>\nneighborhood of $25,000 per year per child there, as compared to  <br/>\nregular classrooms where they are spending roughly $7,000 per year per  <br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328141476,"authorName":"Adrean Clark","from":"&quot;Adrean Clark&quot; &lt;adreanaline@...&gt;","profile":"fuzzyellowduck","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] was: 5 yr old boy now: school districts","postDate":"1212278861","msgId":33306,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwZGQzNGUzMDgwNTMxMTcwN283NzQ1ZmEwNngzOWZlZGE5MTU1MzNhYzExQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33308,"prevInTime":33305,"nextInTime":33307,"topicId":33306,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I find that odd because often parents of deaf children have to fight to get their kid sent to the deaf school - where for sure they ll get the services they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1744545420\">I find that odd because often parents of deaf children have to fight<br/>\nto get their kid sent to the deaf school - where for sure they&#39;ll get<br/>\nthe services they need.
