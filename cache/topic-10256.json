I find very <br/>\nlittle support for homeschooling her.  I belong to a few yahoo <br/>\ngroups but - they are pretty mainstream homeschoolers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, my advice would be to get off those lists!! But that&#39;s a<br/>\npersonal thing.<br/>\nI have cared for kids with Downs and I just don&#39;t understand all the<br/>\npush for them to be taught and schooled.  I believe that while there<br/>\nare obvious physical and mental differences with Downs, they can learn<br/>\nbeautifully with unschooling.<br/>\nUnschooling is all about meeting the child&#39;s needs in their own unique<br/>\nway, so if there is something that helps her, you&#39;ll find it right?<br/>\nAnd letting every child simply BE who they are is so important in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know what I love about DS people? They tend to be so SUNNY! They<br/>\ntake joy in the little things and smile SO much....what a great<br/>\nexample of living the unschooling life. I say trust her and let her<br/>\njust BE.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much of the things I&#39;ve read on schooling kids with differences, is<br/>\nhow to make them fit in to society. How about honoring them for who<br/>\nthey are today? I think the things she loves and will be best at, will<br/>\nshow up even better in an environment of support and TRUST.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10240,"nextTopicId":10265}}
