I am becoming less and less surprised that I am ending up where I am as a mother.  It started with breastfeeding and has evolved into unschooling.  These last few weeks, I have truly come into the realization that unschooling is just the next step in a process that began with a goal that I had before I had my children.  I decided that my goal as a parent would be to raise children who felt good about themselves, who had high self-esteem.  This has to do with the fact that I have struggled with having high self-esteem.  Little did I know where this would lead me because at every turn, I have to work on who I am in order to parent in a way that allows my children the freedom to be who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a beautiful thing to be able to leave our children material wealth, but nothing compares to the love.  I once remember an alcohol and drug counselor saying that he had NEVER treated a patient for alcohol and drug addiction who said that they were addicts because their parents did not buy them enough stuff.  It is the lack of love that had them there.  It is comments like those that keep me determined to continue to open myself more to my children, husband and people in general.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey may not remember our name, but they will have our love.......There is no greater legacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 3:44 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Family comments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~&quot;The love you show your<br/>\n  children will be passed on from generation to generation.&quot; Well, <br/>\n  that&#39;s it<br/>\n  isn&#39;t it?

I think that many<br/>\npeople whose children learn at home feel a bit insecure when we hear about<br/>\nother children who are in school and their achievements.  Most of us are<br/>\ntrailblazers when it comes to hsing and especially unschooling.  However, I<br/>\nhave always taken the stance that people can say what they want to about how<br/>\nI parent my children but the proof will be in the pudding.  Both of my sons<br/>\nwere/are hip babies until at least 3 yrs old.  My sons stay under me and<br/>\nmany people have said that I needed to push them away to be more<br/>\nindependent.  I have been talked about for extended breastfeeding and<br/>\nco-sleeping.  Of course, I am the trailblazer for this type of parenting<br/>\nwithin my family and my circle of friends.  So many people talked about me<br/>\nand said that I needed a break.  I would always tell them, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.<br/>\nThe proof will be in the pudding.&quot;  Now, I get so many compliments on my<br/>\nchildren, their behavior and how smart they are all the time.  Even when I<br/>\nthink that they are buck wild, people will say that they are so happy and<br/>\nwell-behaved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt boils down to us trusting our inner knowing that the way we have decided<br/>\nour family will run is what is best and is working.  As I have stated in<br/>\nanother post, my mother passed away 8.5 years ago, that was three years<br/>\nbefore I gave birth to my first son.  Her death has shaped the way I parent<br/>\nmy children.  It made me realize what was most important and that is<br/>\nrelationships.  She had cancer and in the last few months what I heard her<br/>\npondering most was her relationships.  She had to come to terms with those<br/>\nthat were maybe not the best and she even called people to make peace with<br/>\nthem.  I had to remind her that her relationships with her husband and<br/>\nchildren were so powerful and strong that in my opinion that was her<br/>\ngreatest life&#39;s work.  She had 3 children who loved her deeply even to this<br/>\nday.  So for me I don&#39;t focus much on any of the world&#39;s standards for my<br/>\nchildren because I know what really matters.  Relationships.  I am happy for<br/>\nany person&#39;s child who does well and receives accolades, but I am most happy<br/>\nthat my children are happy and feel good within their skin.  I am also most<br/>\nhappy that if I were to die today, that I gave my children the greatest gift<br/>\nthat I could, the gift of ME!  The gift of my time and building our<br/>\nrelationships.  Because it was the relationship that I had with my mother<br/>\nthat helped me to stand in the midst of the grief that I had after her<br/>\ndeath.  I don&#39;t remember much of anything that my mother gave me other than<br/>\nherself.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if my family came to me in anyway other than respectfully regarding how<br/>\nmy children are learning, I would talk their ears off about the studies and<br/>\nwhatever else I needed to to let them know that my way is just as good as<br/>\nthe child who is going to school.  I would not be mad as I spoke, I would be<br/>\nresolute.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry.  The proof is in the pudding.  Your children are fabulous just<br/>\nbecause they are who they are.  They don&#39;t need dance recitals and spelling<br/>\nbee competitions to prove their self worth.  What you are giving your<br/>\nchildren in unschooling is a gift that will last far longer than any<br/>\naccolades they would get from competitions and school.  The love you show<br/>\nyour children will be passed on from generation to generation.

I would not be mad as I spoke, I would be resolute.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry.  The proof is in the pudding.  Your children are fabulous just because they are who they are.  They don&#39;t need dance recitals and spelling bee competitions to prove their self worth.  What you are giving your children in unschooling is a gift that will last far longer than any accolades they would get from competitions and school.  The love you show your children will be passed on from generation to generation.  Feel good about what you are doing and enjoy the family get together despite!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: simplemom3 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 5:36 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] RE: Need Support<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m new here and it&#39;s a bit embarrassing to &quot;bare my soul,&quot; but here <br/>\n  goes....I received an email this morning from my niece, (we both have <br/>\n  girls that are within one month of each other in age) proudly <br/>\n  announcing that her dd just won the regional spelling bee for her <br/>\n  school.  It goes on to say that she really didn&#39;t have much time to <br/>\n  practice, because she danced in the Nutcracker Ballet all <br/>\n  weekend....Grrr.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I am ashamed of the feelings I&#39;m having.  Our family Christmas party <br/>\n  will be this coming Saturday.  Although my niece won&#39;t be there (they <br/>\n  live a few hours away and can&#39;t come), I am already imagining the <br/>\n  barrage of comments that I&#39;ll have to field (about the sensational <br/>\n  achievements of said child).  Suffice it to say that my family <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t understand homeschooling, let alone unschooling....and most <br/>\n  of them think that my dc would be &quot;better off&quot; in school.  My great-<br/>\n  neice&#39;s latest achievements will simply solidify (in family&#39;s mind) <br/>\n  that the best opportunites come for kids who are in school.  All <br/>\n  these chances to gain a college scholarship, ya know....My poor kids <br/>\n  just stay home all day and do &quot;nothing.&quot;  (Last two sentences are the <br/>\n  imagined (real?) comments of family members.)  Part of the reason <br/>\n  they&#39;re not in school is becuz I HATE the competition kids have to <br/>\n  face there -- but I guess competition is everywhere, especially when <br/>\n  children are very close in age.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for allowing me to vent my frustration.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sharon <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8351,"nextTopicId":8209}}
