If so, they&#39;ll come and sit<br/>\nand talk, whether they eat or not.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do things very much the way Pam described. We LOVE having family<br/>\nmealtime. In our last house, things weren&#39;t set up to be very<br/>\nconducive to this (art supplies all over the table etc..) but we<br/>\nbought this house because of the kitchen and extra space that was SO<br/>\ninviting for family meals and gathering.<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve been cooking a lot of evening meals and even breakfasts. The<br/>\nkids are loving it. We don&#39;t all get hungry at the same time though,<br/>\nso just like Pam&#39;s example, I&#39;ll have a child out munching while I&#39;m<br/>\npreparing the meal.  <br/>\nWe help each other get what we need, at any given time, even if<br/>\nsomeone is hungry right before dinner. I&#39;ve had kids eating huge bowls<br/>\nof ice cream as dinner is being prepared, then sit down and eat loads<br/>\nof dinner too! Trust.<br/>\nI value that time to eat and connect around the table. We DO spend<br/>\nloads of time together, but as kids get older, they&#39;re more involved<br/>\nin their own activities so it&#39;s nice to really connect again in the<br/>\nevening (or whenever).<br/>\nI still trust them to listen to their own bodies. I try to cook foods<br/>\nwe all like, but if someone wants a peanut butter sandwich or other<br/>\nsnack instead of what I prepared, that&#39;s ok too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBedtime around here is when *I* can&#39;t keep my eyes open any more.:)<br/>\nBecause the two younger ones want me to tuck them in, cuddle, read<br/>\nstories etc... except on the rare occasion that Jalen wants to finish<br/>\nwatching a movie, they sleep when I can&#39;t stay up anymore.:)<br/>\nThey&#39;re pretty tired by then anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older boys stay up almost all night though. The key is whether<br/>\neveryone is letting the tired people sleep. Dh goes to bed earlier<br/>\nthan anyone...so we all get quiet for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTypically, Sierra (who loves bedtime ritual) will say &quot;I have a great<br/>\nidea Mom. I&#39;m going to take a warm bubble bath, then let&#39;s read books<br/>\nand cuddle, ok?&quot;  So she usually starts up the calm-down time.<br/>\nThey love to read lots and lots of books lately, so I read until my<br/>\nhead starts to fall forward and then we turn off the lights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s &quot;bedtime&quot; around here. It might be 9:30, it might be<br/>\nmidnight...just depends on the days activities and how tired we all are.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7798,"nextTopicId":7601}}
