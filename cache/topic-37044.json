I&#39;ve already had a taste of<br/>\nhow good things can be when the tape recorder is off and things are<br/>\nrunning smoothly.  My husband is a big reinforcement officer for the<br/>\nvoices too, so this journey is very difficult!  Balance is something<br/>\nI&#39;m striving for, balance in meeting my own needs, my kids&#39; needs, and<br/>\nmy husband&#39;s too.  This is very difficult.  In my moments of regret<br/>\nafter screaming at my children and quitting unschooling, I have phoned<br/>\nunschooling friends who give me the very simple advice of changing my<br/>\nperspective.  I was on another list for a bit, and the first time I<br/>\nwas given that idea, I misunderstood and thought I was being told to<br/>\ndeny my feelings and just get over them.  I understand now that&#39;s not<br/>\nwhat it means to reframe things and change perspective.  And putting<br/>\nthings in a different perspective doesn&#39;t deny what I&#39;m feeling, it<br/>\ntruly does change how I see the situation and therefore how I react to<br/>\nit.  The thing I need help with now though, is how to pinch myself or<br/>\nsomething in the moment that I need to change perspective.  I get so<br/>\nfar ahead of myself in my moments of frustration, that I simply fall<br/>\nright back in with the tape recordings from my childhood.  There is no<br/>\npause, there is no thought, it&#39;s like I&#39;m on auto-pilot.
