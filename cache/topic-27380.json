To get some clarity you might try a game of pretend.  Pick <br/>\nyour favorite unschooling mom off one of the lists or maybe someone <br/>\noff-list that you know and respect.  Imagine that you are her and <br/>\nyour son is just your son.  How would this experienced unschooling <br/>\nmom react?  You might try several people and imagine their <br/>\nresponses.  This may allow you to separate your own doubts and fears <br/>\nfrom your sons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how I would imagine my most respected unschooling mom:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would probably not be fearful of her son&#39;s process and would not <br/>\nconfuse his anxieties with her own (if any).  She would most likely <br/>\nbe excited that her son is doing lots of thinking on the topic and <br/>\nexploring his options.  She would be eager to explore right along <br/>\nside of him to see how she might be of help.  If her son asks, &quot;push <br/>\nme through&quot; several years&#39; curriculum.  She would welcome his <br/>\ninvitation without fear. She might ask him questions for him to <br/>\nanswer so he might get a deeper understanding of his needs and <br/>\nwishes.  Here are some examples of a question she might ask.  &quot;You <br/>\nneed me to _push_ you through?  Is that true?&quot;   &quot;When you imagine me <br/>\npushing you, how does it make you feel?&quot;  &quot;Does it make you feel <br/>\njoyful?  Stressed?  Happy?&quot;  In other words, help would come without <br/>\nfear of the outcome and would still allow him to proceed to find the <br/>\nbest solution for _him_.  She might make suggestions herself, being <br/>\nmindful that they are not colored by her own preferences. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Turns out he wants to think about going to school for several <br/>\n </span></blockquote>reasons: to show<br/>\nhimself he really can be an academic whiz, to see how he fits in to <br/>\nthe school<br/>\nculture, and to make more friends. I am looking for more ways to find <br/>\nfriends<br/>\nbut I think there is a self-confidence issue here, too. A fear that <br/>\nhe couldn&#39;t<br/>\nhack it in school (in his mind).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is me talking now.  Perhaps it&#39;s a good time to brainstorm and <br/>\ntry finding as many ways as possible for your son to gain confidence <br/>\nin him self.  His lens may be too narrow right now to see that there <br/>\nare many other ways to feel competent, confident and successful <br/>\nwithin his areas of interest.   One of those ways is probably not <br/>\ngetting `pushed&#39;.  His belief that he needs to be pushed leads me to <br/>\nsuspect that he is still emerging from a school paradigm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you are feeling shaky about all this unschooling stuff, you <br/>\ncan still facilitate his journey.  The best way I have found when I <br/>\nget shaky is to pretend, if even for a moment, that I have no fear <br/>\nand no doubts.  It invariably gives me a different perspective on the <br/>\nproblem and allows me to see things clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133390932,"authorName":"Mara","from":"Mara &lt;mamadeluz@...&gt;","profile":"mamadeluz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling myself","postDate":"1193538307","msgId":27383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMDI1NS44ODYxNy5xbUB3ZWI1MzIwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyMjU3OS42NjgxMC5xbUB3ZWI1OTIxMy5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27382,"nextInTopic":27384,"prevInTime":27382,"nextInTime":27384,"topicId":27380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi again, I was talking to another unschooling friends the other day who s son started watching one of those shows and we were talking about how unrealistic","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1658904040\">Hi again,<br/>\nI was talking to another unschooling friends the other<br/>\nday who&#39;s son started watching one of those shows and<br/>\nwe were talking about how unrealistic they are - <br/>\nI believe if you talk to your local school about<br/>\nhaving your son come in and visit one day - or<br/>\npossibly sit in on a class of his choice, that should<br/>\nbe possible, to quell his curiousity.
