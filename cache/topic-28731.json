My oldest DD is 4 1/2 and even though she hasn&#39;t been in daycare since she was 3, I have been Nannying outside the home with my children for the past year and a half  and now will be home with both the girls, and working outside the home in the evenings. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondered if others have been in a similar situation? I feel like she has some things to heal from her daycare experience. And wondering if anyone has any suggestion on how to support her.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\nin St. Paul<br/>\nBrynn <br/>\nMaya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
