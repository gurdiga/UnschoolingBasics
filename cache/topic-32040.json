The human body,<br/>\nin whatever form it takes, is extremely limited and weak.  It cannot fly on<br/>\nits own; it cannot move very fast; it cannot see without light; it cannot be<br/>\nunderwater for long.  Yet technology makes it possible for us to do these<br/>\nthings.  Deaf people do everything, only they do some things differently<br/>\nsometimes.  It is society that likes to put down people for different<br/>\nirrational reasons, just so that a few are considered superior to all<br/>\nothers.  Deafness is one of the many excuses society uses to do this.  But<br/>\nsociety will use anything it can use, so the answer to being okay is NOT<br/>\ntrying to fit its ideal but coping with what you are in spite of that silly<br/>\nideal.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe some of the people here unschool their kids because they can<br/>\nprovide their children with an environment in which they are absolutely<br/>\nokay, no matter what labels sick people have for them based on gender, skin<br/>\ncolor, learning style, whatever.  The kids are REALLY okay; unschooling is a<br/>\ngreat way to reinforce this.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG.<br/>\nVersion: 7.5.524 / Virus Database: 269.23.5/1398 - Release Date: 4/25/2008<br/>\n2:31 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.524 / Virus Database: 269.23.5/1398 - Release Date: 4/25/2008<br/>\n2:31 PM<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328141476,"authorName":"Adrean Clark","from":"&quot;Adrean Clark&quot; &lt;adreanaline@...&gt;","profile":"fuzzyellowduck","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Early Intervention","postDate":"1209144731","msgId":32137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQwZGQzNGUzMDgwNDI1MTAzMm43MzNhMjNiM245NDA3MzZhNTg4MTgyNDFhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32136,"nextInTopic":32143,"prevInTime":32136,"nextInTime":32138,"topicId":32040,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s also the misconception that those in the medical community tend to advocate - that learning sign prevents the child from speaking.

We are starting this process with my 22-month-old nephew. My kids never had the problems this child has and even though, as I explained to one of the therapist coordinators yesterday, we homeschool and don&#39;t push, this child needs some help. He has had a very difficult start in life and needs us to do more than what came natural with our own kids. OTOH, I will not participate in anything that I don&#39;t feel comfortable with and have been assured that all the interventions -- he has multiple problems -- are play based and very gentle. We&#39;ll see how it goes and feel free to use what helps and reject what doesn&#39;t. And we always have to keep in mind that this is a child who will be going to public school, which changes the equation a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all of this reminds me of the &quot;swimming lessons&quot; I took my son to when he was about one or so. They were more for me to learn how to help a little kid learn to swim than for him.
