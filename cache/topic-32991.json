She has<br/>\nasked me direct questions like, &quot;Why does he only talk in TV scripts?&quot; and<br/>\nthings like that. One thing I am really keen to do is explain it openly. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t just want to say, &quot;He&#39;s special and unique.&quot; Because that&#39;s what my<br/>\nfamily said to me about my brother who had &#39;learning difficulties&#39; as we<br/>\nsaid in those days. But I never understood what was really up with him and<br/>\nwhy he never had any friends, and why I could see so clearly what he was<br/>\nmissing in conversations. They seemed to brush the issue under the carpet<br/>\nand not admit he was different or explain it to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no problems explaining to her that I am helping him to think<br/>\n&#39;better&#39;. I think it is better to be able to think flexibly, to see<br/>\nsolutions instead of problems, to have resilience in the face of<br/>\nfrustrations, to be able to think your way through the &#39;messiness&#39; of life,<br/>\nto be able to read relationship cues and signals, to understand and enjoy<br/>\nirony and humour. It&#39;s better than being locked into a static system, than<br/>\nreacting with anxiety to any differences in life. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRDI therapy is all about going back and giving the ASD child a &#39;second<br/>\nchance&#39; to develop those flexible thinking and relationship skills that most<br/>\nbabies &#39;get&#39; automatically. It&#39;s slowing the relationship down, minimising<br/>\ndistractions and having a lot of fun together. It has made a huge difference<br/>\nto my son and his ability to relate to the loving people around him and<br/>\nrespond to their love.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nCecily<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32816,"nextTopicId":32992}}
