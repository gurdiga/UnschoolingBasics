We ve just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-237107239\">&lt;&lt; What natural remedies are you familiar with?? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Rachel,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also currently struggling with stress-related (and perhaps seasonal) depression.  We&#39;ve just completed a huge move and all our stuff that&#39;s been in storage in different locations has converged on us.  While it&#39;s great to FINALLY be settled somewhere, the house is still a crazy feng shui nightmare, even after working on it for three weeks now!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can really commiserate with your situation and feelings.  My two-year-old&#39;s need to nurse is very high and his sleep schedule is all over the place (his response to all the stress).  The last couple of days I&#39;ve struggled to not resent his need to nurse so much, and the erratic sleep schedule is taking it&#39;s toll on me.  So I&#39;ve been thinking of all the natural things I&#39;ve learned (over many years of dealing with depression) that I need to do to feel good, and figured I&#39;d share and maybe you&#39;ll find something helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most ridiculously simple things are also THE most important for me.  And although they&#39;re so simple, one of my therapists had to drill them into my head.   Here&#39;s what she told me:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;EVERY day, you need to do these five things:<br/>\n   - Eat nutritious food<br/>\n   - Drink plenty of healthy fluids<br/>\n   - Get plenty of sleep, ideally on your body&#39;s preferred schedule<br/>\n   - Get some fresh air and exercise<br/>\n   - Enjoy some pleasant, supportive social interaction (preferably face-to-face)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know all this might sound SOOO obvious to most people -- like, &quot;DUH!!&quot;.  But when I get moderately depressed, it&#39;s VERY easy for me to &quot;forget&quot; or simply avoid eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising, and especially socializing.  And then things spiral down and down.  So when I first start feeling the effects of depression setting in, I have to VERY consciously focus on doing those five things and am able to keep from getting worse and begin feeling better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, feeling better also means identifying the stressors and triggers (right now it&#39;s the stress and fatigue of the move, messy house, and poor sleep) and figuring out how to manage, minimize, and/or better deal with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as supplements, I take primrose oil and/or flaxseed oil.  Those make a huge difference for me, especially if wacky hormones are contributing to my moodiness.  I also have to be super vigilant to avoid the foods I&#39;m allergic to (wheat, dairy, eggs, high fructose corn syrup, MSG).  When I&#39;m feeling generally good, I can eat a bit of those things now and then with little or no affect.  But when I&#39;m feeling depressed, they make me highly irritable and even angry (especially wheat!).<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I also had a doctor determine that my adrenal gland wasn&#39;t functioning well and that my cortisol levels were severely low all day.  He put me on a VERY low dosage of hydrocortisone (he called it a bio-replacement dosage, nearly replacing what my adrenal gland&#39;s not producing).  That not only dramatically helped my mood problems, but also stopped the weight loss, joint problems, and hypoglycemia that had been troubling me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest thing about that doctor was that he talked to me for 45 minutes during the first visit, and kept asking &quot;So, if we fixed all that, would you be totally healthy?&quot;  And then I&#39;d think of something else that was bothering me. :)  He&#39;s the first doctor who spent so much time trying to understand my TOTAL health picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe you can find a holistic-minded MD or other practitioner who will help you find any underlying physical problems that may be contributing to your depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also many, many, MANY great posts in this list&#39;s archives about how to identify and work through any thoughts or feelings that are dragging you down.  This is something I also find essential in maintaining or regaining my mental health.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, for many years I ONLY worked on my mental and emotional processes, without paying attention to the physical and biochemical aspects of my depression.  And while I learned lots of valuable tools to direct my thoughts and feelings in healthier ways, I remained mildly to severely depressed for many years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I began learning about how to take care of myself physically (both on the practical level and at the deeper biochemical level) that I&#39;ve been able to maintain relative mental health (going on almost four years now!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, that&#39;s my story. :)  Sending you a {{{HUGE HUG}}}!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie WH</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30359,"nextTopicId":30404}}
