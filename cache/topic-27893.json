If something<br/>\nis really very expensive and I don&#39;t have it right<br/>\nnow, I tell them if it is important to them, then we<br/>\nwill try to acquire it at a later time, and if they<br/>\nstill want it then, I buy it. So, we have a LOT of<br/>\ntoys, and animals, and books and are starting to get<br/>\nsome video games as well - . Often times they don&#39;t<br/>\neven ask, if I see something they might like ( a toy,<br/>\ngame book, food, whatever) I will buy it anyways. <br/>\nThey are truly living in abundance, and since they<br/>\nknow they can basically have whatever they want, they<br/>\noften don&#39;t want anything, or what they desire is very<br/>\nsmall. For example we have frequented the Lego store a<br/>\nlot last summer, buying quite a good amount of sets.<br/>\nRecently, my ds (6) wanted to go just to buy an<br/>\nEmperor key chain. <br/>\nOne time at the library ds (3) liked one of the<br/>\ndinosaurs so much he wanted to take it home.  That not<br/>\nbeing an option I offered to go to a toy store to look<br/>\nfor one just like it. He was also hungry, so we<br/>\ndecided together to go home, eat something, look<br/>\nthrough his box of dinosaurs to see if he would still<br/>\nlike the other one, and if he feels a strong need to<br/>\ngo out and buy one, we will. Once home, he decided he<br/>\nliked the ones he has and did not need to go out to<br/>\nbuy the other one. <br/>\nBoth boys are very generous with their toys and<br/>\nthings, they have no trouble sharing most of them and<br/>\nhave given things to friends as gifts.<br/>\nTo explain our frequent visits to the lego store in<br/>\nthe summer, I told an employee that we are doing Lego<br/>\ncamp at home. Had they gone to a summer camp somewhere<br/>\nit probably would have cost even more -<br/>\nOften times, when something was very expensive, I was<br/>\nable to find it second hand, ebay, etc. <br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n--- pionerlife &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pionerlife@...\">pionerlife@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am curious what everyone does when their children<br/>\n&gt; ask for something<br/>\n&gt; to be bought- say a toy, video game, book, candy,<br/>\n&gt; etc. Do you go ahead<br/>\n&gt; and buy it?

So now it is 7 pounds a week. But that doesn&#39;t mean David and I don&#39;t still buy things for them. It depends on the thing and the money and our mood. It means, though, that they have their own money to offset the days when David or I are feeling like things are too tight to buy more things. It gives them power over things to choose. Just now Simon and I were discussing a purchase he made yesterday. He got Mario Galaxy but because I wasn&#39;t sure how much money he had, when we got home I discovered that he had less money than the ticket price. I offered to cover the overspend, but he said he&#39;d rather be in the hole to me for 2 weeks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith candy, which seems a separate thing &#39;cause it&#39;s food, I try to buy enough candy when we go grocery shopping to cover them for a week (or more, really, candy disappears fairly slowly, depending on the candy and the season--I eat more chocolate in winter, nad the number of people sleeping over that week). If we are out and they want some I usually buy it, just as I would a sandwich or some french fries or a giant pretzel or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\nI am curious what everyone does when their children ask for something<br/>\nto be bought- say a toy, video game, book, candy, etc. Do you go ahead<br/>\nand buy it?
