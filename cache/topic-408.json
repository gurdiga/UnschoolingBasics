They see all the other kids with their <br/>\nbackpacks and new pencils sitting at little desks. They see <br/>\nplayground equipment and chalkboards... They wonder, &quot;What&#39;s going <br/>\non there? What am I missing out on?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys (ages 5 & 8) have watched the school bus stop across the <br/>\nstreet from our house for soooo long. Then a couple of weeks ago we <br/>\nwent to a renaissance faire, and we got to ride a school bus from <br/>\nthe parking lot to the front gate of the faire. The boys were beside <br/>\nthemselves with excitement to FINALLY be getting on that big yellow <br/>\nbus. After our five minute ride I asked them if it was as fun as <br/>\nthey thought it ws going to be. Their answer was a <br/>\ndisappointed &quot;no.&quot;I think they were imagining it would be something <br/>\nlike &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8yo went through a brief period when he wanted to go to school. <br/>\nSo I told him what school was like. Yes, there are some fun parts, <br/>\nbut there are also parts he would really hate. I told him that the <br/>\ncool part about unschooling is that you decide what your &quot;school&quot; is <br/>\nlike. If you&#39;re enjoying an activity you can do it all day long. If <br/>\nyou&#39;re not enjoying an activity you can walk away from it, or change <br/>\nit to suit yourself. School doesn&#39;t give you that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter watching cartoons like &quot;Arthur&quot; on PBS or &quot;Recess&quot; on Disney <br/>\nChannel he has seen how school causes conflicts and &quot;interrupts&quot; the <br/>\notherwise fun lives of the characters, so that turned him off on <br/>\nschool a bit. He also has a public schooled friend who fills him in <br/>\non all the horrible stuff like detention, and girls chasing you at <br/>\nrecess &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter will probably bring up &quot;the big school&quot; a lot in the <br/>\ncoming months because well-meaning strangers will notice that she&#39;s <br/>\nabout the right age for Kindergarten and they&#39;ll ask her if she&#39;s <br/>\nexcited to go to school, blah, blah, blah.

Let her create her &quot;school&quot; and ask her to tell <br/>\nyou about it - what happens on a typical day, what&#39;s the name of her <br/>\nschool, what supplies and equipment does she use? And then let her <br/>\nknow that it&#39;s okay if she rearranges things or changes her mind <br/>\nabout what she wants to do because it&#39;s HER school.

I talked to him about his brother and how he had gone to school and we were not sending him back.  I also told him it would be hard to see his friends who were not homeschooling because the schedules were so different.  We talked about his still being prone to having accidents and how that might make him feel very uncomfortable in school.  He was adamant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI in my heart felt he really was not ready for school and the possible hurt to his self esteem was in my mind as my middle child is my most sensitive child and he is my most introverted child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did decide that for many reasons he just was not going to school.  When he is older and if he wants to try it I will be fine with it.  Now at 7 he has not desire to be there and has a much better idea of what he would miss if he was in school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe got all the school stuff from everything around him and people always asking him if he was going to kindergarten?

We have said that we believe that <br/>\nkids learn all the time, and don&#39;t have to go away to school to <br/>\nlearn.  We have acknowledged why it seems she is interested, &quot;you <br/>\nthink it would be fun to ride the school bus&quot; or &quot;you think that it <br/>\nwill be fun because you might get to play with the other kids&quot;.  We <br/>\nhave casually explained that recess is only for a short time, and <br/>\nthat the rest of the time, she would have to sit very quietly in a <br/>\ndesk, and will not be allowed to talk much with the other kids.  We <br/>\nhave said that we would miss her, and that she would be gone most of <br/>\nthe day, and not able to be with the family doing fun things like <br/>\n________.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight she said she wants &quot;to sit at a desk and listen to the <br/>\nteacher tell her to write in her book&quot;.  I said I would be glad to do <br/>\nthat at home with her and she emphatically said &quot;NO&quot;.  I changed the <br/>\nsubject and told her that I have been thinking that it might be fun <br/>\nfor her to join a club called Girl Scouts...where she will meet with <br/>\nother girls, and have a book to write in.  She was excited and happy <br/>\nabout that and dropped the school talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow best to handle so she can feel right?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":419,"nextTopicId":422}}
