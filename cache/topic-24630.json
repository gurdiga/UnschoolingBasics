I already keep a blog (link in sig) and<br/>\nit seems like a good way for me to keep track of things. I love to go back<br/>\nand read everything we&#39;ve done and what the kids have learned. Also it helps<br/>\nwith finding out dates we did things. I could imagine that keeping a blog<br/>\nwould be helpful... I don&#39;t know about keeping a site, I do know that<br/>\nblogging (at least with blogspot) is EASY and that is what I need...nothing<br/>\nto complicate my already busy life. And you can set it to private and invite<br/>\nonly those you want to read it.<br/>\nGood luck and have fun!<br/>\nJen<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach The Bradley MethodR natural childbirth<br/>\n<br/>\nContact me for more info:  &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iluv2rlx@...\">iluv2rlx@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iluv2rlx@...\">iluv2rlx@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re always up to something new:  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/\">http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/\">http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of zanyzingzap<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 21, 2007 9:45 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] blogs, sites and educationalese?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease bear with me if you see this more than once I am trying to get<br/>\nlots of information so am posting on a few lists...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere to start?
