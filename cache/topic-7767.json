Most boys need<br/>\n<br/>\na lot, going by the ones I&#39;ve met.  When I was a small child, I didn&#39;t <br/>\nneed a lot myself and couldn&#39;t see why people had to have so much<br/>\nsleep. <br/>\n  I&#39;m still not a good napper, which leads straight to a bigger need<br/>\nfor <br/>\nnight time sleep now that I&#39;m older, especially since I&#39;m experiencing <br/>\ninsomnia which I never used to have except in college, which doesn&#39;t <br/>\nreally count.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeh.

When ds was little I was rarely tired at all because he slept a<br/>\n<br/>\nLOT.  Now that he&#39;s older and more lively, bahhh ZZZzzzzzzzzzz I&#39;m not <br/>\ngetting near as much rest.  Can&#39;t imagine doing this routine with 4 or<br/>\n5 <br/>\nchildren simulaneously.  *Kudos* to those that do!<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes ds stays up watching tv with dh.  Other times he&#39;ll lay <br/>\nfidgeting until he can drift off.  If he can&#39;t drift off, he gets <br/>\nimpatient and dozey ole me (going off to a well frequented back burner)<br/>\n<br/>\nwakes up enough to talk to him about listening to the wind, the dogs <br/>\nbarking outside, the cars going by... I sing to him, recite lines from <br/>\nfavorite stories, and give him all those familiar things to settle down<br/>\n<br/>\nwith.  Simply nursing no longer does the trick every time.

She lost her husband<br/>\n<br/>\nto suicide so if she needs anything she calls my husband and has no fore<br/>\nthought as to what his other responsibilities are and if she doesn&#39;t get<br/>\nimmediate response then she complains<br/>\n<br/>\nto so many people it makes me seriously mad. My husband goes over there and<br/>\nhe does things for her and she is never thankful she just complains a day or<br/>\ntwo latter about the next<br/>\n<br/>\nlist and I mean list of things she needs and in her mind her is responsible<br/>\nand her other two kids do nothing for her. Her daughter lives in London and<br/>\nyou could guess why, not my husband<br/>\n<br/>\nthough he feels a need to deal with it cause what if she gets more ill and<br/>\ndoes what his dad did. What a weight for him to carry mean while I kinda get<br/>\nlast in line for being taking care<br/>\n<br/>\nof. It is not that bad and I love him and understand him and think he is so<br/>\ncaring but it is hard when mil is so unappreciative I just want to scream<br/>\nwake up. I have told her in the past that<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel this is the case and I do it very carefully but everything I say she<br/>\njust seems to say oh I appreciate and not hear a darn thing. Her other son<br/>\nand herself can not get along<br/>\n<br/>\nhe will not put up with her control issues if she demand go look at the bank<br/>\nand see all the work I did he says in a hurry I am busy got a go. I saw it<br/>\nfinally he feels like she is giving him no<br/>\n<br/>\noptions. She truly is one of the sweetest ladies and I don&#39;t want to make it<br/>\nsound all bad but sometimes I wish she would wake up so she could live life<br/>\nmore fully and have better relationships<br/>\n<br/>\nall around. The baby will always like her but if she doesn&#39;t change her tune<br/>\nthe twins will not ever feel bonded to her the way they do to my mom.<br/>\nBecause my mom has problems but she<br/>\n<br/>\naccepts them the way they are and doesn&#39;t care what they do if they are bad<br/>\nby perceptions or good by perceptions it is all the same they are precious.<br/>\nI know mil see this but she has to<br/>\n<br/>\ntreat them that way and stop giving them bad looks when they don&#39;t hug her<br/>\nthey are so loving they would love on her so much if it wasn&#39;t scheduled to<br/>\nher mind set of goodbyes hellos and when she<br/>\n<br/>\nfeels like it without asking ahhh.

My husband has a hard time sometimes he hasn&#39;t looked into any of<br/>\n&gt; this yet maybe<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; he will but he feels we should not take them anywhere if they are not able<br/>\n&gt; to respect the people in the place we are in especial peoples houses. His<br/>\n&gt; mother can be<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; real hard on my twins that really bothers me she always thinks they are<br/>\n&gt; doing things on purpose trying to hurt dogs at her house. I know that if<br/>\n&gt; they are thought to be bad<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; by someone in a place that we are in they react the way they are expect to<br/>\n&gt; by that person. So I really don&#39;t like to go places that people have pre<br/>\n&gt; judged my kids and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my parenting. My husband mom just sent and email to me about this toy she<br/>\n&gt; bought the kids to be at her house that Seth took home cause he absolutely<br/>\n&gt; loves it<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; it goes to a huge set of pop ons and doesn&#39;t seem it should matter that he<br/>\n&gt; keep it she said something about kids needing to learn what borrowing thing<br/>\n&gt; and taking things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Ahh he wasn&#39;t intending to forget to give it back and I will take it back<br/>\n&gt; next time he has lost interest in it so I could easily get it and take it<br/>\n&gt; back and he would not notice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel she implies control and she seems to have no clue how a kids mind<br/>\n&gt; works he is not an adult and can not be forced to think as an adult. I have<br/>\n&gt; taken them to peoples<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; houses with dogs and they were wonderful with the dogs they love all kinds<br/>\n&gt; of animals and they are not premeditating to hurt anyone. She has made some<br/>\n&gt; suggestions<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; that she thinks Skylar would purposely hurt the baby I told her it<br/>\n&gt; bothered me that she was saying this and that it would so far from the<br/>\n&gt; truth. Things are not always this<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; bad with my husbands mother but I don&#39;t feel she listens to me and<br/>\n&gt; respects my feelings. She wants to force affection on the kids and gets<br/>\n&gt; angry truly when they cry cause<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; she hurt them by not really be couscous of weither they were ready for a<br/>\n&gt; hug. I like it when she comes over here there are to many things I have to<br/>\n&gt; worry about over at her<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; house cause she tends to have way to many expectations. If there was a way<br/>\n&gt; to talk to her about her approach maybe things could be a little better. I<br/>\n&gt; think the way<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; my husbands mother is has rubed off on him a little and it may take<br/>\n&gt; sometime for him to see the affects of the new approach and relize we need<br/>\n&gt; to see that we are so<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; much like the children and we to can be irrational and we to need someone<br/>\n&gt; to listen and not just demand for us to see it from their perspective. I<br/>\n&gt; have a lot to learn<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I know how my husband works the more I addapt to the non coerion style the<br/>\n&gt; easier it will be for him to do the same. He mirro&#39;s how he sees me treat<br/>\n&gt; them. I will have<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; to devolop even more patients in my life.

I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know at night it isn&#39;t going to happen, so I prepare myself for that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think it&#39;s unrealistic to have alone time at night in a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; families, unless the children are ready to wind down earlier...I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; As far as transitioning from fun activities, we always talk about any<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time constraints ahead of time. When Jalen was smaller, they knew I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would prioritize his needs if he started to get cranky and needed to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go home. Usually, he would nurse and cuddle wherever we were and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just had to be on the sidelines a bit more. If he really needed to get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away from stimulation though, we left.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would make dates for going back someplace they loved, or plan a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; quick stop on the way home (somewhere we could just pick something up,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; like Krispy Kreme) and usually that was good enough. Five is really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; young, it&#39;s really hard for them to get outside themselves and see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; anything beyond what is interesting right NOW..as it should be.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I DO step in and &quot;dictate&quot; sometimes....I don&#39;t really like that word,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because it implies no discussion, something we do a lot of. But there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; have been times that one child&#39;s needs had to be prioritized, that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the challenge of larger families.

My husband has a hard time sometimes he hasn&#39;t looked into any of<br/>\nthis yet maybe<br/>\n<br/>\nhe will but he feels we should not take them anywhere if they are not able<br/>\nto respect the people in the place we are in especial peoples houses. His<br/>\nmother can be<br/>\n<br/>\nreal hard on my twins that really bothers me she always thinks they are<br/>\ndoing things on purpose trying to hurt dogs at her house. I know that if<br/>\nthey are thought to be bad<br/>\n<br/>\nby someone in a place that we are in they react the way they are expect to<br/>\nby that person. So I really don&#39;t like to go places that people have pre<br/>\njudged my kids and<br/>\n<br/>\nmy parenting. My husband mom just sent and email to me about this toy she<br/>\nbought the kids to be at her house that Seth took home cause he absolutely<br/>\nloves it<br/>\n<br/>\nit goes to a huge set of pop ons and doesn&#39;t seem it should matter that he<br/>\nkeep it she said something about kids needing to learn what borrowing thing<br/>\nand taking things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAhh he wasn&#39;t intending to forget to give it back and I will take it back<br/>\nnext time he has lost interest in it so I could easily get it and take it<br/>\nback and he would not notice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel she implies control and she seems to have no clue how a kids mind<br/>\nworks he is not an adult and can not be forced to think as an adult. I have<br/>\ntaken them to peoples<br/>\n<br/>\nhouses with dogs and they were wonderful with the dogs they love all kinds<br/>\nof animals and they are not premeditating to hurt anyone. She has made some<br/>\nsuggestions<br/>\n<br/>\nthat she thinks Skylar would purposely hurt the baby I told her it bothered<br/>\nme that she was saying this and that it would so far from the truth. Things<br/>\nare not always this<br/>\n<br/>\nbad with my husbands mother but I don&#39;t feel she listens to me and respects<br/>\nmy feelings. She wants to force affection on the kids and gets angry truly<br/>\nwhen they cry cause<br/>\n<br/>\nshe hurt them by not really be couscous of weither they were ready for a<br/>\nhug. I like it when she comes over here there are to many things I have to<br/>\nworry about over at her<br/>\n<br/>\nhouse cause she tends to have way to many expectations. If there was a way<br/>\nto talk to her about her approach maybe things could be a little better. I<br/>\nthink the way<br/>\n<br/>\nmy husbands mother is has rubed off on him a little and it may take sometime<br/>\nfor him to see the affects of the new approach and relize we need to see<br/>\nthat we are so<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch like the children and we to can be irrational and we to need someone to<br/>\nlisten and not just demand for us to see it from their perspective. I have a<br/>\nlot to learn<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how my husband works the more I addapt to the non coerion style the<br/>\neasier it will be for him to do the same. He mirro&#39;s how he sees me treat<br/>\nthem. I will have<br/>\n<br/>\nto devolop even more patients in my life.

I do  <br/>\nthink it is fair to say, in advance, &quot;We can probably stay two  <br/>\nhours.&quot; Then try to hold out at least as long as you&#39;ve said you  <br/>\nwould. Set a timer so the kids can watch the time remaining easily  <br/>\nand the timer going off will be their signal that it is time to go.  <br/>\nOR say, &quot;We might have to leave any minute.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is really hard for them to leave - to make transitions - then  <br/>\ntalk about a &quot;way&quot; to do that.

This is<br/>\n&gt; very much a juggling act for parents with more than one kid. You want to<br/>\n&gt; provide options and sometimes young children have trouble seeing beyond the<br/>\n&gt; immediate situation, seeing the dangers or problems their choices may cause<br/>\n&gt; someone else.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have 5 kids, I understand. I think it helps to look at it from the kids&#39;<br/>\n&gt; perspective, think of how you would want it handled if you were the kid and<br/>\n&gt; then try to do your true best to meet everyone&#39;s needs and lots of their<br/>\n&gt; wants.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Example: Of course the kids didn&#39;t want to leave the play area at the<br/>\n&gt; restaurant. They were having a great time. So the question becomes, did you<br/>\n&gt; really NEED to leave the restaurant at that time? Or were you just tired of<br/>\n&gt; being there? How would you handle it with your dh if you needed him to leave<br/>\n&gt; something he thought was important to do something for you? Try to use that<br/>\n&gt; same feeling, same tone of voice when you talk with your kids. Would it have<br/>\n&gt; helped to talk to the kids before hand about how long you would be able to<br/>\n&gt; stay? Did getting grumpy with them help the situation in any way or just<br/>\n&gt; make you all miserable?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We go to the park every Tuesday with lots of friends. The kids LOVE it.<br/>\n&gt; Problem is that we absolutely must leave by 2:45 so I can get my older<br/>\n&gt; daughter to her job. It isn&#39;t fair to make her late just because the other<br/>\n&gt; kids don&#39;t want to leave yet. So we talk a lot about it. I asked the kids<br/>\n&gt; how they would like the park handled since we absolutely MUST leave the park<br/>\n&gt; after ONLY 3 and half hours &lt;grin&gt;. They asked to make sure we got there<br/>\n&gt; early....I strive for us to be the first ones there. They asked to have a<br/>\n&gt; warning that it would soon be time to go....I give them a 5 minute warning<br/>\n&gt; and then go around and gather all their things for them so they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; to miss play time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I guess what I&#39;m saying is that it isn&#39;t so much the details of how you<br/>\n&gt; handle the situation, that will vary from family to family, situation to<br/>\n&gt; situation. But try to respect how things are from your kids&#39; perspective,<br/>\n&gt; get their input if there are ongoing problems, truly listen to them and try<br/>\n&gt; to go above and beyond for them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be times when the kids still don&#39;t want<br/>\n&gt; to leave the park, but I know that I have done what I can to lessen the<br/>\n&gt; problem for them, I know they at least feel listened to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie S.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n&gt; From: Brooke North &lt;gbnorth@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Date: Thursday, November 17, 2005 9:51 am<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro. etc...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have really been struggling this week with different aspects of what<br/>\n&gt; &gt; control means and when do suggestions start to cross the line.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yesterday we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were at the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids museum and every thing was going well I gave the kids the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; option of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; checking out other rooms in the section we were in . For some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; reason they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; both just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stayed with me and the baby , she is two maybe one day I will stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; callingher the baby she likes it, anyway back to the event. I told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Skylar that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was taking<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Seth to the bathroom and didn&#39;t realize that she was deciding not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to come.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; She went off to a part of the museum we were not in or around this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bother be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; great deal. I told her when I found her that I was scared not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; knowing where<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she was and had she spoken to me and said I am going to the big ed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thatwould<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be different. But us being that far away still would make me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; uncomfortable.I don&#39;t know how anyone can be that far away I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; feel awful if something<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happened to my child. Next we went to mc donalds to play cause we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go to the park and it was going to rain. Well the baby was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ready to leave<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and tired so I told them we would need to get ready to go cause<br/>\n&gt; &gt; she was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tired and it was going to be difficult to stay. They started<br/>\n&gt; &gt; screaming and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stuff and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were no longer listening to me and I felt like I must look real<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bad. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; finally just sat right outside the play area and asked them to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; please get<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their shoes that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I would wait there for them. I did not want to go on and on with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them. Once<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I got in the car I lost it a little and raised my voice and told<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was hard for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me and I felt like they were taking advantage of the fact that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was giving<br/>\n&gt; &gt; them more options and that they had to understand when we go out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the house<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that in certain places that we need to behave in a way that is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respectful to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the venue. Like I have and issue with standing on furniture I can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not allow<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. How<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can I be non coercive and still help them to understand certain<br/>\n&gt; &gt; boundaries.Like bed time they went in their room at my suggestion<br/>\n&gt; &gt; around ten the thing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bone tired and have had no way to spend time alone or catering to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs and they wanted to keep watching movies past eleven thirty<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I could<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; go to sleep it they are awake it is impossible at this age for me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to do. So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had to go into their room and tell them this. They really didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; protestmuch and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; looked tired themselves and problem would have had trouble<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sleeping if they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; continued to watch movies. So were is the like is there a way to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help me see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am dedicated to this unschooled I see I have more to let go but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am<br/>\n&gt; &gt; running ragged and the only thing I am having time to do is sleep.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by the way the twins are five and will be six in febuary<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brooke<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; On 11/17/05, Ren Allen &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly<br/>\n&gt; &gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a quick shift into a different place, or different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; situation can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really change the energy in the house.

Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; help&gt; start their day off on a positive note.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; getting&gt; as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; made a CHOICE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every day isn&#39;t going to be smooth...that&#39;s just life. But when we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; choose mindfulness, choose to be present in each moment, choose to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare ourselves for the most important role in our lives...it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be good.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SPONSORED LINKS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondary school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Graduate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Graduate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school education<br/>\n&gt; &gt; online&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg&gt;<br/>\n&gt; High<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Chicago<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education&lt;<br/>\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; YAHOO!

This is very much a juggling act for parents with more than one kid.  You want to provide options and sometimes young children have trouble seeing beyond the immediate situation, seeing the dangers or problems their choices may cause someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 5 kids, I understand.  I think it helps to look at it from the kids&#39; perspective, think of how you would want it handled if you were the kid and then try to do your true best to meet everyone&#39;s needs and lots of their wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  Of course the kids didn&#39;t want to leave the play area at the restaurant.  They were having a great time.  So the question becomes, did you really NEED to leave the restaurant at that time?  Or were you just tired of being there?  How would you handle it with your dh if you needed him to leave something he thought was important to do something for you?  Try to use that same feeling, same tone of voice when you talk with your kids.  Would it have helped to talk to the kids before hand about how long you would be able to stay?  Did getting grumpy with them help the situation in any way or just make you all miserable?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to the park every Tuesday with lots of friends.  The kids LOVE it.  Problem is that we absolutely must leave by 2:45 so I can get my older daughter to her job.  It isn&#39;t fair to make her late just because the other kids don&#39;t want to leave yet.  So we talk a lot about it.  I asked the kids how they would like the park handled since we absolutely MUST leave the park after ONLY 3 and half hours &lt;grin&gt;.  They asked to make sure we got there early....I strive for us to be the first ones there.  They asked to have a warning that it would soon be time to go....I give them a 5 minute warning and then go around and gather all their things for them so they don&#39;t have to miss play time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m saying is that it isn&#39;t so much the details of how you handle the situation, that will vary from family to family, situation to situation.  But try to respect how things are from your kids&#39; perspective, get their input if there are ongoing problems, truly listen to them and try to go above and beyond for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be times when the kids still don&#39;t want to leave the park, but I know that I have done what I can to lessen the problem for them, I know they at least feel listened to.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Brooke North &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gbnorth@...\">gbnorth@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, November 17, 2005 9:51 am<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro. etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have really been struggling this week with different aspects of what<br/>\n&gt; control means and when do suggestions start to cross the line. <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday we<br/>\n&gt; were at the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; kids museum and every thing was going well I gave the kids the <br/>\n&gt; option of<br/>\n&gt; checking out other rooms in the section we were in . For some <br/>\n&gt; reason they<br/>\n&gt; both just<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; stayed with me and the baby , she is two maybe one day I will stop <br/>\n&gt; callingher the baby she likes it, anyway back to the event. I told <br/>\n&gt; Skylar that I<br/>\n&gt; was taking<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Seth to the bathroom and didn&#39;t realize that she was deciding not <br/>\n&gt; to come.<br/>\n&gt; She went off to a part of the museum we were not in or around this <br/>\n&gt; bother be<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; great deal. I told her when I found her that I was scared not <br/>\n&gt; knowing where<br/>\n&gt; she was and had she spoken to me and said I am going to the big ed <br/>\n&gt; thatwould<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; be different. But us being that far away still would make me <br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable.I don&#39;t know how anyone can be that far away I would <br/>\n&gt; feel awful if something<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; happened to my child. Next we went to mc donalds to play cause we <br/>\n&gt; were going<br/>\n&gt; to go to the park and it was going to rain. Well the baby was <br/>\n&gt; ready to leave<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; and tired so I told them we would need to get ready to go cause <br/>\n&gt; she was<br/>\n&gt; tired and it was going to be difficult to stay. They started <br/>\n&gt; screaming and<br/>\n&gt; stuff and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; were no longer listening to me and I felt like I must look real <br/>\n&gt; bad. I<br/>\n&gt; finally just sat right outside the play area and asked them to <br/>\n&gt; please get<br/>\n&gt; their shoes that<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I would wait there for them. I did not want to go on and on with <br/>\n&gt; them. Once<br/>\n&gt; I got in the car I lost it a little and raised my voice and told <br/>\n&gt; them this<br/>\n&gt; was hard for<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; me and I felt like they were taking advantage of the fact that I <br/>\n&gt; was giving<br/>\n&gt; them more options and that they had to understand when we go out <br/>\n&gt; the house<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; that in certain places that we need to behave in a way that is <br/>\n&gt; respectful to<br/>\n&gt; the venue. Like I have and issue with standing on furniture I can <br/>\n&gt; not allow<br/>\n&gt; it. How<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; can I be non coercive and still help them to understand certain <br/>\n&gt; boundaries.Like bed time they went in their room at my suggestion <br/>\n&gt; around ten the thing<br/>\n&gt; is I am<br/>\n&gt; bone tired and have had no way to spend time alone or catering to <br/>\n&gt; my own<br/>\n&gt; needs and they wanted to keep watching movies past eleven thirty <br/>\n&gt; and I could<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; go to sleep it they are awake it is impossible at this age for me <br/>\n&gt; to do. So<br/>\n&gt; I had to go into their room and tell them this. They really didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; protestmuch and<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; looked tired themselves and problem would have had trouble <br/>\n&gt; sleeping if they<br/>\n&gt; continued to watch movies. So were is the like is there a way to <br/>\n&gt; help me see<br/>\n&gt; this.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am dedicated to this unschooled I see I have more to let go but <br/>\n&gt; I am<br/>\n&gt; running ragged and the only thing I am having time to do is sleep.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; by the way the twins are five and will be six in febuary<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Brooke<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On 11/17/05, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  &quot;I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly <br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just a quick shift into a different place, or different <br/>\n&gt; situation can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really change the energy in the house. Going for a drive can do the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; same thing. I have a big enough van to keep the children that are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; having issues, FAR away from each other.:)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Being present isn&#39;t always easy, heck, I forget to listen to my own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advice at times!! We&#39;re human, we get cranky, we have hormones and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; life issues and frustrations. Luckily, we also have an <br/>\n&gt; incredible web<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of support (thanks to technology) and a chance to do better <br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I wake up sometimes and really think about how I will respond THIS<br/>\n&gt; &gt; day. Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while <br/>\n&gt; they do<br/>\n&gt; &gt; theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare <br/>\n&gt; myself to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; be present starting right now. I drink my tea, breathe deeply of the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; new day, think about preparing some yummy food they will love to <br/>\n&gt; help&gt; start their day off on a positive note.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; All this helps me really BE there when they awake and come out for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hugs. Those are the days that things really flow, that I&#39;m not <br/>\n&gt; getting&gt; as frustrated (even when challenges arise), because I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; made a CHOICE.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Every day isn&#39;t going to be smooth...that&#39;s just life. But when we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; choose mindfulness, choose to be present in each moment, choose to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; prepare ourselves for the most important role in our lives...it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to be good.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  SPONSORED LINKS<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Secondary school <br/>\n&gt; education&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Secondary+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=ZmtJ9eV8jDgLVf_rQitp3g</a>&gt;  Graduate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school <br/>\n&gt; education&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=_ar44lA2aVf7qUVJT2dfbA</a>&gt;  Home<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school <br/>\n&gt; education&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Home+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=igfV0UPAcfSvC6KUmUYY6w</a>&gt;   Graduate<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school education <br/>\n&gt; online&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Graduate+school+education+online&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=OHt1qK6J19R35_4ff-oJHg</a>&gt;  High<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school <br/>\n&gt; education&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=High+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=BV3EOkp5uIRJ0eqRAZQNcw</a>&gt;  Chicago<br/>\n&gt; &gt; school <br/>\n&gt; education&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Chicago+school+education&w1=Secondary+school+education&w2=Graduate+school+education&w3=Home+school+education&w4=Graduate+school+education+online&w5=High+school+education&w6=Chicago+school+education&c=6&s=185&.sig=pesFSb8HMcPS2_oNEoEwuw</a>&gt;&gt;  ------------------------------<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!

My 7yo son is a bit of a rowdy and when he is getting tired, he can really be in other people&#39;s space.  He has figured out that the calm music to to help calm the house down and he loves rowdy.  When I turn on the music in the kitchen, he has been known to grab his ears and yell &quot;It burns, it burns&quot; until we dissolve into giggles.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know when you are throwing a party, you think about things like traffic flow, making sure nobody will be hungry or thirsty, making trash cans readily available, what we can do to make it a high energy blow out or a mellow cocktail affair.

Set things in place to help guide the energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, November 17, 2005 9:13 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Intro. etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>\n&gt; course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>\n&gt; think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps. <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>\n&gt; Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>\n&gt; Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly <br/>\n&gt; with a<br/>\n&gt; cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>\n&gt; spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>\n&gt; will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>\n&gt; all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a quick shift into a different place, or different situation can<br/>\n&gt; really change the energy in the house.

Yesterday we were at the ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2038223773\">I have really been struggling this week with different aspects of what<br/>\ncontrol means and when do suggestions start to cross the line. Yesterday we<br/>\nwere at the<br/>\n<br/>\nkids museum and every thing was going well I gave the kids the option of<br/>\nchecking out other rooms in the section we were in . For some reason they<br/>\nboth just<br/>\n<br/>\nstayed with me and the baby , she is two maybe one day I will stop calling<br/>\nher the baby she likes it, anyway back to the event. I told Skylar that I<br/>\nwas taking<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth to the bathroom and didn&#39;t realize that she was deciding not to come.<br/>\nShe went off to a part of the museum we were not in or around this bother be<br/>\na<br/>\n<br/>\ngreat deal. I told her when I found her that I was scared not knowing where<br/>\nshe was and had she spoken to me and said I am going to the big ed that<br/>\nwould<br/>\n<br/>\nbe different. But us being that far away still would make me uncomfortable.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how anyone can be that far away I would feel awful if something<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhappened to my child. Next we went to mc donalds to play cause we were going<br/>\nto go to the park and it was going to rain. Well the baby was ready to leave<br/>\n<br/>\nand tired so I told them we would need to get ready to go cause she was<br/>\ntired and it was going to be difficult to stay. They started screaming and<br/>\nstuff and<br/>\n<br/>\nwere no longer listening to me and I felt like I must look real bad. I<br/>\nfinally just sat right outside the play area and asked them to please get<br/>\ntheir shoes that<br/>\n<br/>\nI would wait there for them. I did not want to go on and on with them. Once<br/>\nI got in the car I lost it a little and raised my voice and told them this<br/>\nwas hard for<br/>\n<br/>\nme and I felt like they were taking advantage of the fact that I was giving<br/>\nthem more options and that they had to understand when we go out the house<br/>\n<br/>\nthat in certain places that we need to behave in a way that is respectful to<br/>\nthe venue. Like I have and issue with standing on furniture I can not allow<br/>\nit. How<br/>\n<br/>\ncan I be non coercive and still help them to understand certain boundaries.<br/>\nLike bed time they went in their room at my suggestion around ten the thing<br/>\nis I am<br/>\nbone tired and have had no way to spend time alone or catering to my own<br/>\nneeds and they wanted to keep watching movies past eleven thirty and I could<br/>\nnot<br/>\ngo to sleep it they are awake it is impossible at this age for me to do. So<br/>\nI had to go into their room and tell them this. They really didn&#39;t protest<br/>\nmuch and<br/>\n<br/>\nlooked tired themselves and problem would have had trouble sleeping if they<br/>\ncontinued to watch movies. So were is the like is there a way to help me see<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am dedicated to this unschooled I see I have more to let go but I am<br/>\nrunning ragged and the only thing I am having time to do is sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nby the way the twins are five and will be six in febuary<br/>\n<br/>\nBrooke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 11/17/05, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;I tend to &quot;hide&quot; from the kids when I&#39;m overwhelmed and of<br/>\n&gt; course it&#39;s just a vicious cycle.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being sensitive to stimulation makes it difficult as a parent....I<br/>\n&gt; think being very proactive in a situation like that really helps.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t wait for the &quot;overwhelmed&quot; thing to happen, take steps when<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re feeling calm and centered.<br/>\n&gt; Having many tools in your toolbelt helps...like the stash of toys,<br/>\n&gt; Pam&#39;s chopsticks, new games etc..., taking time to sit quietly with a<br/>\n&gt; cup of tea or a bath when everyone is sleeping, whatever feeds your<br/>\n&gt; spirit so you can connect with your children from a loving center.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have found that when things get tense, a short &quot;meditation walk&quot;<br/>\n&gt; will really help re-focus my energy...or if the kids come along, we<br/>\n&gt; all see new things, find our joy again by being in a new setting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a quick shift into a different place, or different situation can<br/>\n&gt; really change the energy in the house.
