I know that I am contributing in countless ways by being present (home) for my children and am thankful every single moment that I am with them to help them grow into happy individuals, but.... why do I feel &#39;inferior&#39; because there is no monetary contribution to what I do?  Is this something internal that I need to deal with?****<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of people who equate their personal worth with their monetary worth or their ability to bring dollars into their family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, money is simply a means-to-an-end  a way to pay for things or experiences my family wants or needs.  My husband and I both work part-time and mostly from home, to cover our living expenses and give us plenty of time together with our son.  Money does not come into play for me when I consider Meaning of Life type questions  and my net worth doesn&#39;t figure in my personal definition of who/what I&#39;m all about.  So though I&#39;m aware people some people think that way, it&#39;s not my way of looking at life :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe authors of Freakonomics look at everything from an economic perspective and make their arguments accordingly.  Often, they boil things down to dollars and cents as a part of that.  Their work and writing are very interesting to me but I often find myself disagreeing.  For example, they make a case against eating local foods, but that case is built largely around costs  and I don&#39;t personally eat mostly-local because it costs less (or more) than eating non-local foods. I do it for taste, health benefits, accountability (I like knowing exactly who grew my food), etc.  So while I can appreciate their argument, it&#39;s not one I&#39;d make if I were talking about Ways To Choose Your Food :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with so many other things, it&#39;s a matter of perspective  where does money come in when you&#39;re thinking about who you are and where/who you want to be (not a question you need to answer here :-)).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf money is an important part of how you think of yourself  then it might make sense to include money-making experiences in your life (part time, freelance, etc. if you want to continue to stay home with your children at the same time), to ensure you have what you&#39;re looking for in terms of a salary.  Or it might make sense to look online for the articles that talk about how to calculate the work a wife/mother does at home (laundry, cleaning, cooking, childcare, etc.) in dollar terms  giving you an idea of how much all the work you do would add up to, if you had to pay someone else to do it.  Or, related but different, the articles online that talk about how much money one parent can save the family by Not Working  cost of a second car, work wardrobe and dry-cleaning, take-out foods when there&#39;s no time to cook, nannies/childcare since you&#39;re no longer home with your children, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: salary","postDate":"1352140254","msgId":49253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs3OTBrdStlNnA2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGs3OGJlcytpbXJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49252,"nextInTopic":49254,"prevInTime":49252,"nextInTime":49254,"topicId":49240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** There are times when George asks me for money.

Or is that something you&#39;re imposing on the relationship, based on your own baggage and experience? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I mean about identifying what&#39;s causing the sense of lack - it might be something as nuts and bolts as a lack of communication. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I wasn&#39;t thinking philosophically so much as<br/>\n&gt; literally with an &quot;allowance&quot; or &#39;budget for mom&#39; type thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can be a real relief to have clarity around finances - whether you call that a budget or allowance or &quot;family discretionary spending&quot;. It&#39;s helpful for kids too! One of the reasons kids will badger parents &quot;can I have? can I have? can I have?&quot; is that the details of family finances can be pretty darned opaque. That&#39;s why some families find budgets and allowances work well with kids - and others find it better to be very transparent about finances without setting a &quot;solid&quot; number. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time it Is philosophical though, because you&#39;re resentful about it. It&#39;s not just a logistical puzzle, it&#39;s personal; about you As a person; you even used the word &quot;inferior&quot;. Maybe the problem is that you&#39;ve Made it personal, tied these ideas of resentment and inferiority to something that really can be just a logistical puzzle: how do we divvy up the resources? The moment divvying up resources becomes more than number crunching it&#39;s a universal philosophical conundrum: what is the worth of the individual in terms of available resources?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The author of the book I mentioned says in order to get a handle on our emotions weÂ need to find a word that attaches itself to that emotion<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a particular philosophy right there ;) Another is that words don&#39;t attach themselves to anything, people do the attaching. So for some reason you picked the word &quot;resentment&quot; to describe an uncomfortable feeling about finances and added the word &quot;inferior&quot; for good measure. That&#39;s not an accident! Especially not given the history of marriage and the rights of women. A lot of historical and cultural messages were pointing you hard at those labels - so many that it&#39;s well worth questioning the labels themselves. Because if the issue is really one of resentment and perceived inferiority, setting up a &quot;mom&#39;s budget&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily going to fix anything. You could just as easily feel like you&#39;re getting a handout from your sugar daddy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, this is a kind of deschooling - it&#39;s part of the process of picking apart the voices and messages in your head which you believe without questioning them. Just as it&#39;s possible for kids to learn to read without being taught, it&#39;s possible to have a conversation about family finances without turning it into a re-hash of the suffrage movement ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143184446,"authorName":"Heather Stafford","from":"Heather Stafford &lt;tandycat@...&gt;","profile":"tandycat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] salary","postDate":"1352070515","msgId":49248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTIwNzA1MTUuMjkyMDcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMTQwMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRFNUI3RTNFLTBEQ0EtNEQ2Qy04MENFLTBGODZEODE4NkRFREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzNTIwNDQyNTAuNTUzMDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTMwMS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxrNzZjZDArdm0waEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDEzNTIwNjQzMjUuNTQyMzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTMwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw0RTVCN0UzRS0wRENBLTRENkMtODBDRS0wRjg2RDgxODZERURAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":49247,"nextInTopic":49249,"prevInTime":49247,"nextInTime":49249,"topicId":49240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We did pretty much this exact approach when we were first married.  We didn t have kids yet and I was still working, but my husband made considerably more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1207455932\">We did pretty much this exact approach when we were first married.  We didn&#39;t have kids yet and I was still working, but my husband made considerably more than I did (and given our professions- physician vs. ecologist- we knew that he always would).  After we got married and combined our money, I was really uncomfortable about the discrepancy for a while, so we established separate discretionary money accounts for each of us.  When we payed the bills each month, we &quot;paid&quot; ourselves as well.  That money was for each of us to do with as we pleased without having to justify our purchases with the other.  We held onto this system for a while (I think we were still doing this when our first child was born and I was no longer working or contributing to the family income), but after a while I realized that I no longer needed this.  My husband has always been very generous about our family money and never worried about any of this, so it was really<br/>\n just me who was concerned about it.  Once I fully realized that, it was easier to let it go and stop worrying about it myself.  Another thing that helped me a lot was being in charge of the family budget- I balance the checkbook and pay the bills each month, so I know exactly how much money we need and how much is extra and available to be spent on other stuff (mostly the extra money goes to the kids, but my husband and I have expenses once in a while as well).  My husband and I joke about how he makes the money and I spend it, but I know he greatly values my contribution to the family even though it is rarely monetary.  I think he&#39;s also glad to not have to worry too much about where the money goes (ie. I pay the bills and am responsible for acquiring everything the kids need/want).  My husband recently changed jobs, so he&#39;s asked to take over paying the bills and setting the budget for a while, and I&#39;m completely happy to let him do it for as<br/>\n long as he wishes because I&#39;ve grown quite comfortable with where the money comes from and how it&#39;s utilized.  So maybe it will be just a matter of time for you to get used to this change in your lives and your relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of that might help you!  -Heather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 4, 2012 3:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] salary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 4, 2012, at 4:25 PM, fundayeveryday wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I wasn&#39;t thinking philosophically so much as<br/>\n&gt; literally with an &quot;allowance&quot; or &#39;budget for mom&#39; type thing<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about having a set amount of money to spend each month on whatever you need rather than asking for each bit? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] salary","postDate":"1352067024","msgId":49247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFNUI3RTNFLTBEQ0EtNEQ2Qy04MENFLTBGODZEODE4NkRFREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTIwNjQzMjUuNTQyMzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTMwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDEzNTIwNDQyNTAuNTUzMDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTMwMS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxrNzZjZDArdm0waEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDEzNTIwNjQzMjUuNTQyMzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyNTMwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49246,"nextInTopic":49248,"prevInTime":49246,"nextInTime":49248,"topicId":49240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He makes enough that we don&#39;t have to consider every dollar spent, and even when we did, he was considering every dollar he spent as much as I was. He also has never thought of it has his money and not mine. I have, on occasion, thought of it that way. And I am very grateful that he earns money so that we can live the life we live. But the sense of not having my own money has faded with experience of his generosity. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know people who have a set amount over which money discussions occur. So you can spend up to 100 dollars and after that you discuss the item being purchased. The amount can change based on financial circumstances. My mother-in-law had an allowance of sorts. My father-in-law would pay her a salary, I believe, although it wasn&#39;t really stated as such. So, still, she has her own money. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you need to ask him for the money, or tell him what you&#39;ve spent? If David spends money I like to know because I am the budget keeper. It isn&#39;t totally necessary, but it helps for our monthly budget if I know when it needs to be re-jigged. I&#39;m not keeping tabs on his spending out of any meanness, but because money matters to how our lives go. It&#39;s an our team kind of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience thinking about it as being on the same team, working together has really helped me to not feel as though what I do has less merit than what David does. I&#39;m not earning money directly, but I am doing work and service in our family that David supports financially and that has value. Absolute value, even without financial remuneration. And, even though it is such a good life. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: fundayeveryday &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristenssrr@...\">kristenssrr@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent: Monday, 5 November 2012, 7:25<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: salary<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nTo send a clearer picture of what I am speaking of, I have to rule out some things first...<br/>\n <br/>\n(you might be experiencing some dissatisfaction )...<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely not dissatisfaction because no matter what happens during the day with the kids, I am thrilled to be doing what I am doing.<br/>\n <br/>\n( What do you think is so desirable about that other life that you resent it&#39;s lack in yours?)...<br/>\n <br/>\n What I stated is a lack of income- in my name,  a personal monetary contribution.  What I&#39;m getting at is beyond what is being spoken about here.<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s paycheck is used for bills, obviously,  but when it comes time for extra spending (hair cut, family birthday presents) I have a feeling that<br/>\nI am spending money that isn&#39;t mine because I have to ask for it or let him know about the spending. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n(Do you want &quot;financial independence&quot;?

There are still repetitive tasks, dull moments, frustrations and a million other imperfections. Some people become very unhappy for awhile after achieving a particular dream lifestyle; once the novelty wears off, the world is still the world and you&#39;re still you. Whether that&#39;s true or not, it could be really helpful to think about what you imagine someone else&#39;s life is like - your husband&#39;s, maybe, or a working friend&#39;s life. What do you think is so desirable about that other life that you resent it&#39;s lack in yours? Build up that fantasy as rich as you like, but be aware that it Is a fantasy.<br/>\nThat even if the person you&#39;re imagining is living his or her dream life, it&#39;s not more special or perfect - it still has dull times, repetitive tasks, frustrations and hassles in it. Giving up one dream life for another won&#39;t necessarily make you any happier. Once you have a sense of what you lack, look for ways to bring those things into your life or change your attitude about them. Do you miss real grown-up conversation? Join a study group or a book club - maybe online - so you can have some. Do you want to solve real, meaningful problems rather than kid-problems? Volunteer. Join a political action group. Become an advocate of some sort. Again, that might be something you do online or on weekends while your husband has the kids. Do you want &quot;financial independence&quot;?

Are you a Real artist if you&#39;re not &quot;making a living&quot; at it? Are you a Real artist if you don&#39;t sell your work at all? And if you were selling your work you could Still have the same insecurities - are you making work just to feed the hungry masses and paying the bills? Is your work Worth anything, really? These kinds of questions and feelings aren&#39;t confined to women and mothers (or artists, either) - they&#39;re &quot;universal&quot;. They aren&#39;t even confined to the question of no pay/low pay and self esteem. They&#39;re some of the big, deep questions of existence: what is the value of a person&#39;s life? How do you measure that value? They&#39;re philosophical or spiritual questions.

Ah, now, That&#39;s part of the your-life-is-better-than-mine fantasy. The breadwinner of a family isn&#39;t independent of that family.)<br/>\nMy goodness, I am not saying his life is better than mine-in fact, he and I both know we couldn&#39;t do what the other person does for a living.<br/>\n<br/>\n(You don&#39;t need to label them &quot;resentment&quot;)<br/>\nThe label does sound bad, but actually it is the premise of focusing.  The author of the book I mentioned says in order to get a handle on our emotions we need to find a word that attaches itself to that emotion, otherwise we are just floundering around thinking &#39;I don&#39;t know why I feel this way or that way when we talk about (money)&quot;.  Using the word resentful has led me to the feeling that technically he doesn&#39;t have to report to anybody about his spending, whether it is for the family or for himself. Let me say that we both know where every dollar is spent because it is talked about, it&#39;s just a matter of me having to ask when I need money because I don&#39;t have any!!!! lol.   That is probably why I stated feeling &quot;inferior&quot; in an earlier post. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I may have posed my question incorrectly. When I asked &#39;how do people deal with any feelings of resentment&#39; , I wasn&#39;t thinking philosophically so much as<br/>\nliterally with an &quot;allowance&quot; or &#39;budget for mom&#39; type thing.  Maybe that explanation of my thoughts will help with the replies.  Sorry for the confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom: Meredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, November 4, 2012 1:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: salary<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nfundayeveryday &lt;kristenssrr@...&gt; wrote: &gt;&gt; We are living our dream by having me home with our children, so I guess part of myÂ problem/mistake is attaching money/salary to a person&#39;s worth and contribution to the family *************** As odd as it may seem, you might be experiencing some dissatisfaction Because you&#39;re living your dream - and life is still life.
