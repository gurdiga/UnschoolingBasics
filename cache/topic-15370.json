One thing I&#39;ve taken to doing to help with <br/>\nthe twinges is (a) refine the buying a bit - don&#39;t just presume that <br/>\nsince we ate 6 avocados last week that we&#39;ll need 6 avocados this week <br/>\ntoo - I&#39;ll ask and we&#39;ll discuss. (b) I&#39;ll use a bit of the money <br/>\nsaved from not overbuying (whenever possible) to pick up one of <br/>\nthose &quot;Food for All&quot; cards they have at the grocery checkout (are they <br/>\nlocal or national things?) or something such as that which helps get <br/>\nnutritious food to those who need it (Food for All and Foodshare both <br/>\naddress local hunger I believe and there are plenty of organizations <br/>\nthat address world hunger issues). Another idea that I&#39;ve seen is that <br/>\npeople will round off the amount (if it comes to $123.62 they round to <br/>\n$125 for instance) and tuck away that difference each week. Then they <br/>\nuse that mount to send to wherever. Could do the same with coupon <br/>\nsavings - whatever amount you saved from the grocery budget by using <br/>\ncoupons, buying store brands instead of namebrands, buying the <br/>\nspecials, and so on goes to hunger relief projects - you haven&#39;t <br/>\nchanged your own budget but you&#39;ve had an incentive to buy more <br/>\nmindfully. For example, if you skip buying the packaged cookies and <br/>\nmake your own at home, the difference in cost would go to relief.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go outside your home, you can check with local <br/>\nfacilities such as bakeries and groceries and local shelters and food <br/>\nkitchens and try to arrange for day-old products to go from the bakery <br/>\nto the food kitchen instead of the dumpster. There are regulations <br/>\nabout things related to food safety but often there are ways to manage <br/>\nit. For example, we have a big Thanksgiving luncheon here at work on <br/>\nthe Wednesday before Thanksgiving - pasta dishes, cold cuts platters, <br/>\ndesserts, side dishes, etc. One of my coworkers helps wrap things up <br/>\nafterward and takes the usable stuff over to a local shelter - they <br/>\nget lots of stuff for Thanksgiving but not a lot before or after.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120206043,"authorName":"averyschmidt","from":"&quot;averyschmidt&quot; &lt;patti.schmidt2@...&gt;","profile":"averyschmidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: strategies regarding food........","postDate":"1152167483","msgId":15395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4aWFucitwaW85QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU4aDNkbyticm1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15385,"nextInTopic":15396,"prevInTime":15394,"nextInTime":15396,"topicId":15370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... food ... baffles ...
