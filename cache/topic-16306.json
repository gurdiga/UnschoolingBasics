Your motivation is to keep a happy home (I can  <br/>\nrelate!) and perhaps for awhile the praising was helping but now you feel it is  <br/>\nno longer genuine.  Is it your tone of voice?  I hear many parents  using too <br/>\nmuch sweetness and it just sounds fake.  I hear myself using it  from time to <br/>\ntime and I just cringe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou are helping two small children navigate the difficult world of  <br/>\nrelationships, I think everyone could use some help there!  I think what  you are doing <br/>\nis great, my kids still need some help to see how what they do  affects the <br/>\nother.  But if they are balking to my talking, I stop.   With my kids, sometime <br/>\na private smile or a nod is enough.  I think I  use the descriptive talk <br/>\nmostly when I am alone with the child now (I appreciate  that you helped your <br/>\nbrother today, even though you didn&#39;t want to).<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you are concerned with returning to the less-than-peaceful home, I  <br/>\nsuggest working on building relationships with each child individually and also  as <br/>\na family.  Perhaps if you put your energy *there* instead of focusing on  <br/>\n*their* relationship, you might move out of this phase that feels  manipulative.  <br/>\nThen you can move in periodically when it does feel  necessary or genuine.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Too much Praise!!!!
