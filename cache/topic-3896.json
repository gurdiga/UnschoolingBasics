They took my ashtray full of pennies, an old<br/>\npair of binoculars, and the film in my conference tote bag. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI�m so very sorry, because I had procrastinated taking them to be developed,<br/>\nand actually didn�t realize they were part of the theft until I had parked<br/>\noutside the photo place to take them in, and started looking for the bag in<br/>\nthe car.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
