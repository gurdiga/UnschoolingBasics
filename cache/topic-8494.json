I am Mama to an 8 yr old son <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and soon to be 5 yr old daughter residing in southern Maine. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; This is our second year of homeschooling ... last year we tried <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the &quot;sit down and study this&quot; method as this was what my husband <br/>\n&gt; &gt; was convinced was homeschooling but after pulling my hair out and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; my son not learning a thing we radically went to unschooling for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; the second half of the year. We are very happy with our decision <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to unschool and I see marked improvements in both my children <br/>\n&gt; &gt; since making that decision. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I do still feel very very much as a newbie so I look forward to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sitting back and reading the discussions on list. I am hoping <br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone might also have suggestions on how to encourage <br/>\n&gt; &gt; phonics/reading for my son ?? I am trying not to force it on him <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but he chooses still at 8 yrs of age to not read. This is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult for me as I am an avid reader but he honestly has no <br/>\n&gt; &gt; interest yet, Heck even Harry Potter and Pokemon his two favorite <br/>\n&gt; &gt; characters didn&#39;t intice him into reading :( <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thanks! <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Brightest Blessings, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mel <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

Guess <br/>\n&gt; what they choose? Quiet time is somthing that must occur for the little ones, <br/>\n&gt; what the <br/>\n&gt; older ones choose to do is their choice, as long as it&#39;s quiet. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 8yo with autism could not read phonetically, we taught her with whole <br/>\n&gt; language, and <br/>\n&gt; then after a while she started to pick up phonetics right when she turned eight. <br/>\n&gt; Like you, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m an avid reader and the thought that one of my kids either couldn&#39;t read or <br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; choose not to broke my heart. Part of it is letting go of some expectations, <br/>\n&gt; not every child <br/>\n&gt; will enjoy reading. But we did point out to our kids that once you can read, you <br/>\n&gt; can learn <br/>\n&gt; whatever you want through a book. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Looking back, I taught myself how to read, but my brother Chris despised reading <br/>\n&gt; because <br/>\n&gt; a) it made no sense in his brain and b) everyone else made it such a big dea <br/>\n&gt; that he could <br/>\n&gt; not readl. He taught himself to read when he was older through the catalogs and <br/>\n&gt; instructions for electronic kits and such. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, long sprawling reply, hopefully it makes some sense. I&#39;m still sleep <br/>\n&gt; deprived with <br/>\n&gt; a newborn nursling, And welcome, i&#39;m new here myself.

Because of her deficits, she does not necessarily <br/>\n&gt; learn by <br/>\n&gt; watching, like many kids do, through example. Most of our education is real <br/>\n&gt; world though, <br/>\n&gt; and her math is going to the store and buying things, learning how to order at <br/>\n&gt; fast food <br/>\n&gt; restaurants, how to pay, get change, etc. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In that way parents are facilitators, what are some other ways that parents on <br/>\n&gt; this board <br/>\n&gt; facilitate education? I just wonder if parents here ever contrive a learning <br/>\n&gt; situation. This past <br/>\n&gt; week, the kids are interested in chemistry, so I made sure that in our baking <br/>\n&gt; we talked about <br/>\n&gt; chemical reactions, changed the recipes some to see how more baking soda <br/>\n&gt; affected the <br/>\n&gt; dough, etc. When we were boiling water we started with ice cubes and talked <br/>\n&gt; about changing <br/>\n&gt; energy to move through states of matter (josh&#39;s interests right now is chemistry <br/>\n&gt; and narnia) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I must go, there&#39;s a brawl afoot.

Math is chess and sudoku and cooking and building and <br/>\n&gt; guessing and designing and art and....... <br/>\n&gt; Where are the steps for that? In school, we are taught in a linear <br/>\n&gt; fashion. You have to learn addition before subtraction, then on to <br/>\n&gt; muliplication, blah, blah, blah. Nothing could be more contrived and <br/>\n&gt; less natural than that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For one, they never tell you that addition and subtraction are the <br/>\n&gt; same thing (inverse operations is all) and multiplication and <br/>\n&gt; division are again, mirrors of one another. I never knew you could <br/>\n&gt; simply add to subtract until I was an adult. argh. Linear &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>\n&gt; stunts the mind...I want my kids to have no part of that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s all part of our journey as schooled minds. WE have to see the <br/>\n&gt; learning in everything and value it all before unschooling really <br/>\n&gt; unfolds well for US.:) Kids get it quite well, if we just stay out <br/>\n&gt; of their way. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I DO expose my children to new and different things than if I just <br/>\n&gt; waited around for some interest to arise. They don&#39;t even know <br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s available out there if we don&#39;t share enough of the world <br/>\n&gt; with them.

Both my husband and myself are <br/>\n&gt; avid readers. We read not only bedtime stories but also the Harry Potter series, <br/>\n&gt; the Eragon series, Magic Treehouse, Junie B Jones, Phantom Stallion etc with our <br/>\n&gt; children. We actually have a childrens&#39; book collection to rival some small town <br/>\n&gt; libraries that is often used and well loved. <br/>\n&gt; The suggestion about closed captioning ... thank you! I actually enjoy reading <br/>\n&gt; the TV so I do turn on the cc when the children and I happen to be watching TV <br/>\n&gt; when Dh isn&#39;t home (it annoys hubby to have the scrolling words so we refrain <br/>\n&gt; when he is home). <br/>\n&gt; My son loves to have Capt. Underpants read to him and he leafs through the books <br/>\n&gt; on his own but still no inkling to try reading them.

The sauerkraut got a chuckle from <br/>\n&gt; DH and nothing from DS. The trampoline room had DS wanting to go <br/>\n&gt; visit Bill Gates (and a brief discussion of where Bill Gates got all <br/>\n&gt; the money to build it) and discussion of rooms we could have if we <br/>\n&gt; had lots of money to build anything we wanted. Simply bringing bits <br/>\n&gt; of the outside world into our home - the same as we have music and <br/>\n&gt; movies and books and wire and batteries and legos and videogames and <br/>\n&gt; recipes and shopping trips and computers and magazines and...it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; all part and parcel of life and we all &#39;snack on&#39; whatever is of <br/>\n&gt; interest at the time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Deb <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________ <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 16 <br/>\n&gt; Date: Thu, 22 Dec 2005 15:19:30 -0000 <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;beanmommy2&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Welcome to the new members.. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Ren Allen&quot; <br/>\n&gt; wrote: <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I told you all about the &quot;links&quot; section and forgot about <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;photos&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; section.

I&#39;ve been listening to tapes from <br/>\n&gt; the conference and really enjoyed the pics of all those Sorooshians <br/>\n&gt; to connect with the voices and stories. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And Ren, for years I had such a distinct picture in my mind of what <br/>\n&gt; you looked like ... reddish-brown hair, long and sort of <br/>\n&gt; curly/frizzy and wild, and always dressed in bohemian-type long, <br/>\n&gt; swirly skirtsskirts. It was such a distinct picture that I sometimes <br/>\n&gt; forgot I didn&#39;t really know what you did look like. HA!
