After hours of work, they come running to find me just gushing with joy and excitement as they share with me the following details:<br/>\nSon: &quot;Mom!  We  got our relationship up & bought a vibrating bed!&quot;<br/>\nFriend: &quot;And then we crawled in and enabled the mojo!&quot;<br/>\nSon:  &quot;and then we had Woo -Hoo together!&quot;<br/>\nFriend: &quot;Yeah it was so cool!  The lights were flashing!&quot;<br/>\nSon: &quot;And we were under the covers and rolling around&quot;<br/>\nFriend&quot;It was AWESOME!&quot;  (jumps around in excitement)<br/>\nSon: &quot;Did we have sex together??? Is that what Woo-Hoo is??&quot;<br/>\nMom: &quot;That is GREAT! Yes, I am pretty sure Woo-Hoo is sex,  I don&#39;t know what else it could be.&quot;<br/>\nFriend/son:  &quot;Cool!!!!&quot;  (run off to do see if they can get their characters to do it again)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still giggling about this conversation (to myself of course). If I hadn&#39;t known that they were talking about a video game, I think I would have fallen off my chair because they way they described it to me was as if THEY, themselves, had had woo-hoo, not their characters.   And I was also glad for RU making it possible for me to share in their joy about this instead of getting worried, fearful and uptight.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWatching these two boys spend hours at this game, it struck me that this video game was an excellent way for boys to &quot;play house&quot;.  They love the woo-hoo option and their household is definitely over-sexed, but they also seem to recognize that fact.  They seem to be pushing the boundaries of what they themselves consider acceptable sexual behavior within the safe confines of the game.
