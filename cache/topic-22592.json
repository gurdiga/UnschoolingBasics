I&#39;ve lived here for 10 years, but strangely enough I&#39;ve <br/>\nonly been to Boulder a handful of times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoulder has lots of open space and many hiking trails.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nspecifics, but it should be easy to figure out just by asking around.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPearl Street Mall is a pedestrian mall that&#39;s fun for people watching.  <br/>\nFun shops, bookstores, and cafes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCelestial Seasonings is nearby.  They have a free tour that runs every <br/>\nhalf hour to hour or so if you&#39;re interested in sampling some teas and <br/>\nseeing how they&#39;re bagged and packaged.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have too many things going on during this week already, otherwise I <br/>\nwould drive up to meet you.  Have a fun visit!  <br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Anyone around Boulder CO?","postDate":"1174963286","msgId":22592,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV1YTA4bSs2bG9uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22598,"prevInTime":22591,"nextInTime":22593,"topicId":22592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We re tagging along with dh and will be here Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
