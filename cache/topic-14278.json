When we started\nhomeschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-929854051\">Christy,\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone should expect him to sign anything in Cursive.  IMO\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy DD went to PS from Pre-K through 3rd grade.  When we started<br/>\nhomeschooling last fall (and now unschool) I didn&#39;t make her continue<br/>\ncursive (heck, I stopped writing in cursive as soon as they would let me in<br/>\nschool... I still don&#39;t write in cursive except to sign my name and that&#39;s<br/>\ndeveloped to the point where it&#39;s almost non-legitable).  Almost the entire <br/>\nschool year&quot; she didn&#39;t write in cursive at all... but just a few days ago<br/>\nwe were playing around on the white board and writing our names and she<br/>\nstarted signing her name in cursive.  I was surprised that she even<br/>\nremembered how.  She couldn&#39;t remember how to make a few letter in her<br/>\nmiddle name and last name, so I showed her.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a forced learning experience but a learning experience all the<br/>\nsame.  It just happened organically.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhy be frustrated?  Cursive really sucks (IMO) and is introduced way too<br/>\nearly in school now.  He will eventually develop his own style... which may<br/>\nor may not include cursive.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nLesa\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net\">http://lifeacademy.homeschooljournal.net</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stoptherod.net/\">http://stoptherod.net/</a>\r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/\">http://parentinginjesusfootsteps.org/</a>\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n&quot;Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.&quot; \r<br/>\n     -John F.

It is very frustrating to me cuz\r<br/>\nI feel like this is something he should just be able to do almost on\r<br/>\nauto-pilot.  One thing I do not expect is him to know all the letters or\r<br/>\nanything.  I don&#39;t know or care to know how to write in cursive but I CAN\r<br/>\nsign my name.
