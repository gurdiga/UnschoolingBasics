I live in Northeast Ohio.  I have 4 children <br/>\nages  7wks-5 3/4yrs.  I need any info that I can get!  We had/have  <br/>\nbeen doing workbooks off & on.  I really want to jump into to  <br/>\nunschooling though.  But I am totally afraid of keeping portfolios  <br/>\nfor all my children eventually &  having a teacher look at  them.  It <br/>\njust looks easier with a curriculum or workbooks because  you <br/>\njust go through and keep whatever you want with 1 child or 4  <br/>\nchildren.  Any ideas from others who keep track of more than 1  <br/>\nchild?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah, but easier isn&#39;t necessarily better! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere&#39;s a great OH unschooling group. Barb Eaton might chime in with  some <br/>\nmore info on OH laws. Is Barb on this list???? I&#39;ll check. If not, I&#39;ll go  grab <br/>\nher!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have to keep portfolios in SC too. I keep two tupperware boxes in my  <br/>\nkitchen. Whenever we go anywhere, I get two brochures, two ticket stubs, two  <br/>\nwhatevers. Well, mine are pretty far apart in ages, and the 16 year old has a  <br/>\ncar; so we often do things separately now----but we collect paperwork from  <br/>\nwhatever we do in these boxes. I keep disposable cameras in the kitchen and  cars, <br/>\nto take shots of what we do. I keep artwork (or photos of artwork),  <br/>\nplaybills, menus, samples of writing, maps, library lists (they print those out  now at <br/>\nour libraries!), a list of movies watched (the Blockbuster  receipts), <br/>\n----you know: things that would impress a teacher!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOur &quot;schoolyear&quot; runs June through May, so I just placed two boxes under  the <br/>\nbed and put out two empty ones. I also look at these boxes as future  <br/>\nscrapbooks----I just haven&#39;t gotten around to completing them yet----but I have  all <br/>\nthe stuff! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIn SC we also have to keep a journal/assignment book, so I have my  daytimer. <br/>\nI write everything we do into it every day. This also helps me not  forget <br/>\nanything we have coming up, so it serves two purposes! I jot down who  came to <br/>\nplay, where we went, what we did. We only have to record 180 days in SC,  so I <br/>\njust pick out the most &quot;active&quot; days! &lt;g&gt; That means every other day  we could <br/>\nbe comatose! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWith four, I would have four boxes----but none of yours are even school age  <br/>\nyet! I think you should just be PLAYING!!!!!! Enjoy those babies! As they get  <br/>\ncloser to mandatory school age, well, just add one box at a time!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1149,"nextTopicId":1151}}
