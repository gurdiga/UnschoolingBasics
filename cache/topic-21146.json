What do you hope/think<br/>\nyou&#39;ll gain from it? <br/>\n <br/>\nBtw, I&#39;m pretty sure that they have the GED and the SAT and such in<br/>\nCanada as well, which should be able to get you into university. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know whether Canadian universities expect you to write a college<br/>\napplication letter, but if they do, you could use that opportunity to<br/>\nexplain to them why you decided to unschool yourself, despite having<br/>\nhad only 1.5 years left in normal school. They&#39;d probably expect some<br/>\nexplanation, or at least a well-argued explanation might help you get<br/>\nin. Basically, this is the same question as above... What do you expect<br/>\nto gain from unschooling yourself, except that you&#39;ll end up writing it<br/>\nin over a year from now, so that it&#39;ll be &quot;what did you gain from it&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how university is in Canada, btw, but university here in<br/>\nTexas is pretty similar to highschool (in The Netherlands)... I hate<br/>\nit. Too many compulsory subjects, too much rote memorization, too much<br/>\nrepetition, too many classes in which attendance iss compulsory, and<br/>\nthen on top of that huge lectures with 200-300 people (which is the<br/>\nonly thing not like highschool). Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love learning,<br/>\nbut university is not really any better than highschool. I&#39;m dropping<br/>\nout and thinking about perhaps applying to grad school in a few years<br/>\n(which will not be easy, if at all possible), if I happen to teach<br/>\nmyself the stuff I need to know, and if I don&#39;t teach myself the stuff<br/>\nI need to know, apparently I didn&#39;t care enough to begin with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not meant to tell you that you shouldn&#39;t go to university, just<br/>\nthat it might be easier if you stay in school and then go to<br/>\nuniversity, rather than tasting the freedom and then being locked up<br/>\nagain. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thankfully, my parents are supportive of me and I think that once<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; figure out what exactly unschooling is all about they will be okay<br/>\n&gt; with my decision. I want to do this, but it&#39;s daunting. I read about<br/>\n&gt; all these kids my age who bike around South America and work on farms<br/>\n&gt; and do exchanges and find mentors, and it&#39;s rather intimidating. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; shy, introverted, bookwormy girl who needs some beginning advice on<br/>\n&gt; what to do with herself. Thank you very much. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you have to go anywhere<br/>\noutside your home, so it definitely doesn&#39;t mean you have to go to<br/>\nanother continent on your own. In fact, if going to another<br/>\ncontinent/country sounds interesting to you, you might very well be<br/>\nhappier with something a bit more structured like being an exchange<br/>\nstudent. I was an exchange student in Thailand, and it was pretty much<br/>\nlike unschooling (even the English teachers didn&#39;t particularly speak<br/>\nEnglish, so I spent most of the first months teaching myself Thai and<br/>\ndrawing, dancing, etc), but it was structured in the sense that I had a<br/>\nhost family, and a school that gave me the drawing and dancing lessons<br/>\nand such. Lots of freedom, but not too much. If you want to be an<br/>\nexchange student, you should definitely start looking into that very<br/>\nseriously right now, because it takes almost half a year for<br/>\norganisations like AFS to deal with all the administrative stuff etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, if you just want to stay at home and go to your local<br/>\nlibrary and bookstore and teach yourself, that&#39;s just as good as going<br/>\nabroad, and definitely a lot cheaper/safer/easier. What are your<br/>\ninterests? What do you want to major in at university, or do you not<br/>\nknow yet? In fact, depending on your goals, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try the<br/>\nGED and SAT now, and perhaps just go to university a year sooner than<br/>\nintended (that&#39;s what my HB did). But if you don&#39;t know what you want<br/>\nto do with your life yet, unschooling might help you find the answer<br/>\nquicker than uni would. <br/>\n<br/>\nAka, it all depends, lots of stuff to think about, I&#39;d imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nHave a burning question?  <br/>\nGo to www.Answers.yahoo.com and get answers from real people who know.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116719163,"authorName":"J","from":"&quot;J&quot; &lt;ilovemuffins@...&gt;","profile":"bookworm1252002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Intro - possible teenage unschooler","postDate":"1170306104","msgId":21146,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwcnM3bytram9lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21175,"prevInTime":21145,"nextInTime":21147,"topicId":21146,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi there, My name s Jacqueline, I m sixteen years old and I live in Ontario, Canada.
