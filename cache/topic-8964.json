It stood out for many reasons... I started out telling people that I unschool a couple years ago, and then I just started picking and choosing who I told. I got grimaces, and challenging conversations that I wasn&#39;t ready for. After equipping myself better by reading, I just kinda learned who to not waste my breath on. Right now I am at a point where I still don&#39;t tell many people, but I just moved back &#39;home&#39; to Oklahoma, close to relatives. I have only been gone from Oklahoma for about 20 months. I wasn&#39;t bothered and could choose who I told. Now that I am back, my grandmother (she raised me), has totally gone against me and what I am doing because my son isn&#39;t reading everything she thinks he should be. He has been on a lovely gentle reading journey the last year, and yesterday he read me 5 reader books because he wanted to and could. She doesn&#39;t know that because she doesn&#39;t listen. That isn&#39;t good enough for her at 8 years old. She has<br/>\n written me some nasty emails in the last two days, a virtual fight I suppose you could say. I finally had had enough and told her that I am sorry, but I will not participate in this any further. I remembered something a friend told me, that I wasn&#39;t here to make her happy. I have a life to lead, family to care for. I have spent too many years trying to make her happy all the while making my life miserable or living in the &#39;unschooling closet&#39;. It was great to read what Tyra said. I realize now today, that things were different when I was here last, and while I was in Texas, I became my own person more and things changed. They were on their way back to the way they were until I decided to not let her rule my life. I will stand my ground, I will do what I believe in my heart is right for my kids. I feel so much better in doing so. I will tell anyone that asks that I unschool, and more if they want to hear it. I am sure I will have my bean dip days too.

She wouldn&#39;t ask my sister (who&#39;s kids are in PS) what they are learning, or what they did today, she just assumes that since they are in school they are getting what they need.  I&#39;ll never forget the time I mentioned that I didn&#39;t like how competitive and strict their gymnastics teacher was, and she asked me how I expected my children to learn discipline, and I asked her how they learned discipline before they went to gymnastics class, and how did she think that not taking gymnastics would cause them to become undisciplined?  I mean really it&#39;s absurd the expectations she has, but I guess she is so wrapped up in the &quot;main&quot; mentality, she can&#39;t think outside the box.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat occurred to me too, that I could just start my fast anytime I wanted.  It would be a little silly to put it off till a religious holiday that isn&#39;t my religion anyway.  I actually got the idea from LOST, where a character did something kind of wrong (killed in self defense) and spent 40 days in silence (I don&#39;t know if it was in penance or just to reflect on what he did, or make peace with it, or what, but he is Catholic from what I understand).  I remembered Lent had something to do with Mardi Gras, but I couldn&#39;t remember what, other than Fat Tuesday is either the beginning or the end.  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35875473,"authorName":"Heather","from":"&quot;Heather&quot; &lt;heather@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] unsupportive family","postDate":"1137045752","msgId":8966,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzYzVmMTAwLjI5ZWQxYTEzLjMyMDMuNzgyMUBteC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZGMwMWM2MTZjZCQ1MzRkMDBlMCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4="},"prevInTopic":8965,"nextInTopic":8967,"prevInTime":8965,"nextInTime":8967,"topicId":8964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, Tina, I m sorry your mom isn t supportive.

I just got off the phone with my mom who ticked me off to no end.  I haven&#39;t told her we are unschooling, she thinks we are still doing what we have been doing, but what ticks me off is she only asks because she wants to catch us doing something wrong so she can prove it&#39;s not a good idea.  She will drill me on what we are covering in math, history, science, etc, and then when I start to reply with intelligent answers instead of &quot;uh, duh, we don&#39;t do anything&quot; she just ignores me and pops out another question (this was before, when I could actually list books, lessons, etc).  I&#39;ve decided I just don&#39;t want to discuss our homeschooling with her at all anymore, now I just need some canned answers and redirection statement/questions to keep on hand when she &quot;goes there&quot;.  She kept pressing me about when did we start back, and that I need a substitute teacher because I&#39;ve been sick a few times in the last month (I mean how freaking absurd is that??) and what did my kids do while I was sick (I&#39;m sure that what they did was nothing compared to what my sister and I did when we were locked out of the house because she didn&#39;t want to be bothered with us).  I would like to say she&#39;s commenting because she cares, but she&#39;s just looking for something to attack me on.  I mentioned that our AC is messed up in our car and we will probably have to get a new car this summer before it gets too hot, and she said we should sell it now because no one would test the AC now.  Okay, nevermind the fact that I don&#39;t have the money to buy a new car now, it would be better to cheat someone into buying a car with no AC and then I don&#39;t know, WALK for 4 months than to use an otherwise usable car and save up so that we can purchase a car or fix the problem.  We will be rid of two bills in a couple of months and can afford the car payment then, but hey, that&#39;s not important, right?  I told my husband I&#39;m thinking about giving up talking to my mother and MIL for Lent, maybe the 40 days of peace and quiet will give me time to figure out how to handle them.  Except that&#39;s not my religion so I don&#39;t know when Lent is, but I guess I could just start today.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m ranting about my frustrations, I&#39;m sorry.  I just feel for you unschooling in the closet, I&#39;m in there with you.  I wonder if there is a site online with canned responses to things like that?  <br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8976,"nextTopicId":9022}}
