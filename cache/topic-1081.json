The area of<br/>\nbedtimes was one of the easier ones for me.  We&#39;ve all got our places where<br/>\nit was hard to let go.  My son is 4 1/2.  When he was a baby, as most of us<br/>\nprobably did, he followed his need for sleep.  When he was almost 2, there<br/>\nwas a strange cultural phenomenon that seemed to occur: a strong bias for<br/>\nstarting schedules for children.  Everywhere I seemed to look people were<br/>\nsaying how important it was for your child to have them asleep by a certain<br/>\ntime.  They said they didn&#39;t get the right kind of sleep unless they went to<br/>\nbed by a certain hour.  We co slept and he woke many times and I was<br/>\nexhausted.  The names Weissbluth and Ferber were dangled in front of me.  I<br/>\nknew I wouldn&#39;t do that &#39;crying it out&#39; thing but I was desperate for sleep.<br/>\nI also knew I wanted to follow his lead in what he needed.  I would go to<br/>\nthe grocery store w/ my son at night and vague acquaintances would actually<br/>\ncome up to me and talk to me about how I needed to get him into a routine.<br/>\nI suppose I looked like shit and so it wasn&#39;t hard for people to figure they<br/>\nwere doing me a favor.  I think I was at my nadir of my life as a mother at<br/>\nthat point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to our pediatricians wondering if he had some advice.  He said, &#39; I&#39;<br/>\nlook at you and see a tired mother.  If I saw a psychotically exhausted<br/>\nmother I might suggest some sleep training.  But I look at your son and see<br/>\nsuch a happy boy.  I say continue what you&#39;re doing.  He&#39;ll get all the<br/>\nsleep he needs unless of course you&#39;re having  wild parties every night.&quot;  I<br/>\nassured him we weren&#39;t,  That was just the support I needed to continue<br/>\nfollowing his lead and I was very thankful for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he goes to bed around midnight.  I often get into bed before him while<br/>\nhe plays or watches some TV but bc he wants to go to sleep with us and have<br/>\nsome pillow talk, he comes in and we go to sleep together.  If he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go to sleep w/ us I&#39;m not sure what I would do.  It&#39;s easy for me to<br/>\nsay he follows his own cycles but really only up until they collide with dh<br/>\nand mine.  After about 12:30, I&#39;ve just got to go to sleep.  We let him know<br/>\nwhat we need to which I do think helps in the equation.  He sleeps until<br/>\nabout 9: 30.  This works for me since I&#39;m not a morning person and god love<br/>\nhim, he still often naps in the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve thought is for some reason many people extend trust to their<br/>\nbabies but some cultural pressure comes in for some reason around 2.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know why.  I guess time to put childish things away or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem now is my own sleep problems.  For  years I&#39;ve gotten up for 2<br/>\nhrs every night.  Ds is an active sleeper so that&#39;s part of it bc I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways been a light sleeper but the other is I just wake up.  Bing.  Awake.<br/>\nNot anxious.  I get up and read.  I&#39;ve tried so many herbal, homeopathic<br/>\nremedies.  Have occasionally resorted to drugs.  I take natural progesterone<br/>\nand estrogen and thyroid.  Nothing seems to touch it.  I do believe I would<br/>\nbe a much happier person if I could get more than 6 1/2 hrs consistently.<br/>\nWhen I go back to bed, sleep is often then in patches of a few hrs  and then<br/>\nanother few hrs.  I&#39;m not a deep sleeper so things wake me.  I control the<br/>\nenvironment as best I ca to induce sleep (dark, quiet). I need about 8 on a<br/>\nregular basis and haven&#39;t had that for about 6 years.  I could be exercising<br/>\nmore.  That&#39;s the one thing I don&#39;t do except maybe walk quickly around the<br/>\ncircumference  at the park if Ds is involved in something.

Not as long as you mind you. Several things <br/>\nhave helped me to get back to sleep. There is a natural homeopathic <br/>\nessential oil called Peace & Calming. Young Living is the brand. My <br/>\nfriend orders it for me. I am not sure of the manufacturer. It is <br/>\npure essential oils (used topically) that &quot;miraculously&quot; (wish I <br/>\nunderstood this stuff) help you to not start ruminating yourself <br/>\nawake during these wakeful periods. I have found that if I awaken and <br/>\nstart THINKING, I am awake for a couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe peace and calming helps-somehow, I just relax back to sleep. <br/>\nBasically 80-90% of the time it works. If something really needs to <br/>\nbe decided, I have found that the undisturbed time to think is most <br/>\nvaluable. Undisturbed time to think does NOT occur in our house at <br/>\nthis time while ds is awake! So changing my opinion of the <br/>\nwakefulness has also helped. My friend likes to get up and organize <br/>\nclosets, read etc. when she awakens. I NEED to sleep, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a HEPA air cleaner in our sleeping room and the white noise <br/>\nhelps too.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Alison Broadbent <br/>\n&lt;abzb@e...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is my first post here but I guess I&#39;ll just jump right in.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>The area of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bedtimes was one of the easier ones for me.

My DS is now 5 and for about the last year he&#39;s <br/>\nreally been into watching TV/movies before bed.  Our bedrooms are <br/>\nupstairs with just a dinky square-shaped hallway in between.  We have a <br/>\nTV, VCR, and DVD and a futon in the small bedroom straight across the <br/>\nhall from the one we sleep in.  Little by little he was staying up <br/>\nlater than I possibly could and I&#39;d doze off for a few minutes in my <br/>\nbed while he watched TV.  I&#39;m a very light sleeper also so if he was <br/>\nhaving any difficulty I&#39;d hear him and wake right up.  He often doesn&#39;t <br/>\nstay up for long after I&#39;ve gotten in bed and will shut off the TV and <br/>\nthe light before climbing into his bed.

The area of<br/>\nbedtimes was one of the easier ones for me.  We&#39;ve all got our places where<br/>\nit was hard to let go.  My son is 4 1/2.  When he was a baby, as most of us<br/>\nprobably did, he followed his need for sleep.  When he was almost 2, there<br/>\nwas a strange cultural phenomenon that seemed to occur: a strong bias for<br/>\nstarting schedules for children.  Everywhere I seemed to look people were<br/>\nsaying how important it was for your child to have them asleep by a certain<br/>\ntime.  They said they didn&#39;t get the right kind of sleep unless they went to<br/>\nbed by a certain hour.  We co slept and he woke many times and I was<br/>\nexhausted.  The names Weissbluth and Ferber were dangled in front of me.  I<br/>\nknew I wouldn&#39;t do that &#39;crying it out&#39; thing but I was desperate for sleep.<br/>\nI also knew I wanted to follow his lead in what he needed.  I would go to<br/>\nthe grocery store w/ my son at night and vague acquaintances would actually<br/>\ncome up to me and talk to me about how I needed to get him into a routine.<br/>\nI suppose I looked like shit and so it wasn&#39;t hard for people to figure they<br/>\nwere doing me a favor.  I think I was at my nadir of my life as a mother at<br/>\nthat point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to our pediatricians wondering if he had some advice.  He said, &#39; I&#39;<br/>\nlook at you and see a tired mother.  If I saw a psychotically exhausted<br/>\nmother I might suggest some sleep training.  But I look at your son and see<br/>\nsuch a happy boy.  I say continue what you&#39;re doing.  He&#39;ll get all the<br/>\nsleep he needs unless of course you&#39;re having  wild parties every night.&quot;  I<br/>\nassured him we weren&#39;t,  That was just the support I needed to continue<br/>\nfollowing his lead and I was very thankful for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he goes to bed around midnight.  I often get into bed before him while<br/>\nhe plays or watches some TV but bc he wants to go to sleep with us and have<br/>\nsome pillow talk, he comes in and we go to sleep together.  If he didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go to sleep w/ us I&#39;m not sure what I would do.  It&#39;s easy for me to<br/>\nsay he follows his own cycles but really only up until they collide with dh<br/>\nand mine.  After about 12:30, I&#39;ve just got to go to sleep.  We let him know<br/>\nwhat we need to which I do think helps in the equation.  He sleeps until<br/>\nabout 9: 30.  This works for me since I&#39;m not a morning person and god love<br/>\nhim, he still often naps in the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve thought is for some reason many people extend trust to their<br/>\nbabies but some cultural pressure comes in for some reason around 2.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know why.  I guess time to put childish things away or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem now is my own sleep problems.  For  years I&#39;ve gotten up for 2<br/>\nhrs every night.  Ds is an active sleeper so that&#39;s part of it bc I&#39;ve<br/>\nalways been a light sleeper but the other is I just wake up.  Bing.  Awake.<br/>\nNot anxious.  I get up and read.

I&#39;m not a deep sleeper so things wake me.  I control the<br/>\nenvironment as best I ca to induce sleep (dark, quiet). I need about 8 on a<br/>\nregular basis and haven&#39;t had that for about 6 years.  I could be exercising<br/>\nmore.
