We use the kitchen sink or tub as a lab.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - Janice Van Cleeve has REALLY cool science experiment type books.  They&#39;re in the teacher section of the library.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - make paper mache.  Newspaper, and a paste of flour and water.  It can dry in your storage unit, then paint.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - go to the dollar store and get balloons, sidewalk chalk, puzzles, paints, scissors, tape, glue, paper, rubber stamps, string, party blowers, and whatever else looks like fun and your budget allows.  There are shells, pom poms, and LOTS of cool stuff at our dollar store.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - we use Discount School Supply for art stuff and the like.  Go to the clearance section and look around there too.  They have lots of non-toxic stuff and REALLY cool not to be eaten stuff too!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - Tape things from TV.  The travel channel, PBS shows (Nature, etc.).  PBS also has cool things that come on LATE at night that you can tape.  Your library also has a video section that may have cool things like Magic School Bus and the like.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - Books on tape!!  It saves you reading!!  :-)  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - Save the comics section from your Sunday paper.  Give them the comics, scissors, and glue.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  - Make pirate hats and swords (roll up the paper long ways and tape) from newspaper.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope that&#39;s  a start for you!!  If you go to the library, find the teacher section.  The are LOTS of books that can help you!!  Also, there&#39;s science experiments and a kid section  in the comics on Sundays.

Without a car we are pretty limited.  <br/>\nWhen we were unschooling before we had a car - and we were living at my sister&#39;s house....an actual house......and they played out in the backyard a bit.
