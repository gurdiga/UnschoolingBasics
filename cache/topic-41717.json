If hearing issues are ruled out, then I would just not stress right<br/>\nnow - or ever.  But, I would not even take action.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is now 3.5.  He was a doer, not a talker.  He said very few words and<br/>\noften never repeated them.  But, it was clear that he understood everything<br/>\nwe said.  We could ask him questions and he would respond.  To give him<br/>\noptions, we did sign with him and he choose a few signs that were very<br/>\nuseful to him.  To this day he will use the &quot;all-done&quot; sign when he is<br/>\noverwhelmed as a tool to communicate to us that he needs his sensory<br/>\nenvironment to shift.  He was barely talking at 2, but we understood each<br/>\nother so well.  He even made jokes - in his beautiful way - and they were<br/>\nfunny. [He clearly told us we were nutso when we said that the water lapping<br/>\non the sand was a &quot;wave&quot;, since in his world a wave was his favorite thing<br/>\nto do with his hand.  He gave us the &quot;your crazy&quot; look and then the &quot;I so<br/>\nknow you are wrong&quot; look and then smirked at us and waved with his hand,<br/>\nwith sarcasm.... hard to worry about his communication with such<br/>\nexpression.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, words are one way to communicate.  There are many others.  You might try<br/>\nsigns, but only if you feel like doing them with absolutely no expectation<br/>\non whether he will do them.  My son really liked them - he likes to use his<br/>\nbody more than his mouth.  But, I was never attached to him doing them or<br/>\ndoing them in a particular way.  He made up a number of his own and it was<br/>\nour job to learn those.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne day (I think he was around 2.5) he got up from nap, came to the top of<br/>\nthe stairs and yelled, &quot;mama, where-ed dyou go?&quot;  He has spoken in sentences<br/>\never since and now his vocabulary is astounding... we are currently talking<br/>\na lot about various dinosaurs and the difference between omnivores,<br/>\ncarnivores and herbivores.  Big words for a guy who supposedly did not<br/>\ntalk...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does not pronounce certain sounds yet and he has a little stutter that<br/>\ncomes up when he is stressed or really excited.  He also still uses a<br/>\npacifier frequently to help calm himself, which some people claim will<br/>\ninterfere with his speech.  I cannot tell you how many people want us to get<br/>\nhim speech therapy or tell him to take the nuk out or blah blah blah.  He<br/>\njust says no and looks at them like, &quot;I am in charge of that decision.&quot;  It<br/>\nis beautiful.  We are not at all interested in pursuing speech therapy for<br/>\nhis stutter or other pronunciation things unless he asks us to find him more<br/>\ntools - and he knows how to ask and when he needs things.  We &quot;work&quot; on<br/>\nstuff at home... which means we play and language skills naturally and<br/>\nfrequently come up.  We speak clearly and frequently to him (without<br/>\nattention on his mistakes) and over time, when physically and<br/>\ndevelopmentally ready, he has corrected previous &quot;errors&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this is my long and anecdotal way of saying no worries.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nkathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Oct 5, 2009 at 6:22 PM, plaidpanties666 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;eintob, d.a.&quot; &lt;michelle_bailey@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Then my third child had delays.

By two he could only make a few grunting sounds.  We taught him sign language and could understand what he needed most of the time.  At the time we were very traditional parents...he was our first, we were young, we did what we were told.  So, we had him evaluated and it was recommended we place him in a public pre-school program for children with delays.  They did therapy with him and I was thrilled when at 3 he finally said &quot;mama&quot;.  It was decided he had made progress and they needed the room for kids that were worse off, so we were then told to start private speech therapy with him.  We did this for the next two years with very little improvement.  By the time he was kindergarten age (and we were then encouraged to place him in school to help him) he was speaking almost like other kids his age should but pretty much only we could understand him.  Kindergarten was awful and at the end I decided to do what my heart told me and I began homeschooling him.  He speech became normalized by the time he was 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I had a daughter that spoke early and clearly.  Then my third child had delays.

I never thought of it as a speech delay because he was so clearly bright and communicative.  He said so many words for a day and then never again - his first word was &#39;toes&#39; clear as a bell at 10 months, I don&#39;t think he said that again till he was 2 1/2!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when he was about 2 - 2 1/2 he just started talking in full sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its a facet of his character that you don&#39;t see &#39;process&#39; with him - makes trusting unschooling hard at times!  All his learning goes on in his head - and the only visible evidence is when he presents me with the finished &#39;product&#39;.  This has applied to walking independently, talking and now (I suspect) reading - amongst others like fork-control, potty training and so on. Absolutely no visible development - even to a mother&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis younger brother is the complete opposite - every tiny development and idea is tested outloud and extensively ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother in law tells me that my husband was exactly the same.  She says that with his older sister you&#39;d know what mischief she was planning - she&#39;d be hanging around the tape player trying to shove things in.  With Conchur you&#39;d know nothing until he had it in bits all over the floor!<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally Conchur&#39;s father is notorious in his family for talking late - the family story is that he said nothing till he was three, and then his first word was &#39;calendar&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah xxx<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;dinapug310&quot; &lt;b38040@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to ask about speech delays.

We live in NY and plan to unschool.  I have been reading on this list and a couple of others since Thea was born and the unschooling way of life is a great extension of the life I was living before having a child.  I am so grateful to have found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to ask about speech delays.  Thea is not speaking yet and I&#39;m not worried about it as much as I&#39;m curious.  She is extremely bright and we communicate perfectly well.  What piques my interest is that last year around Christmas (she was 16 months, almost 17) she, for about a week, maybe, started to say &quot;moo&quot; and &quot;ho ho ho&quot; and tried to quack like a duck.  Then, she stopped.  Her words were as clear as a bell.  Beyond those words the only other she said was &quot;hot&quot; without the &quot;t&quot; sound and she said that a lot and often and then at some point stopped saying that as well.  I shared in the joy of her mooing and mooed with her, but was careful not to try to get her to speak, though I think I showed her a picture of santa when my mom was over to see if she&#39;d let out a ho ho ho.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wonder what may make children stop speaking after beginning like that.  She is very chatty in her own language and even sits with books and &#39;reads&#39; them aloud to herself in her language with different intonations and at the end will speak her version of &quot;the end,&quot; the way I say it.  And today she saw a cow and went to &quot;moo&quot;, but it was more of a &quot;maw.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t read much about speech delays, because I know the mainstream would suggest all kinds of therapy.  I know some of you have experience with speech delays, though I can&#39;t find too much in the archives for some reason.  But, I was hoping you could share experiences and knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nDina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41720,"nextTopicId":41764}}
