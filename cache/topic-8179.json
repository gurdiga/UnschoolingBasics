He is a &quot;good kid&quot; - he&#39;s  <br/>\npolite, he&#39;s interesting, he talks to adults (although the kids say  <br/>\nhe acts &quot;different&quot; around adults), he seems to love his parents and  <br/>\nhis siblings, he has interests and passions, he seems to get along  <br/>\npretty well with other people, in general and seems overall really  <br/>\ngood-natured and easygoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is frequently &quot;grounded&quot; or has things &quot;taken away&quot; - by his  <br/>\nfather, primarily, for breaking family rules.

Rosie said to him,  <br/>\nlast night, &quot;So, do you think I&#39;m spoiled, because I&#39;ve never been  <br/>\npunished and my parents don&#39;t really ever just say no?&quot; He didn&#39;t  <br/>\nanswer, really, but just came back with the question, &quot;If your  <br/>\nparents ever just said &quot;no&quot; to something, would you listen?&quot; (She  <br/>\nsays he meant would she ignore them and do whatever it is anyway or  <br/>\nwould she abide by her parents&#39; wishes.)

It is perfectly possible to feel defensive<br/>\neven in the absence of attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensiveness can be great because it is a real clue that something needs<br/>\nexamining. I find I feel the most defensive when I am the most in the wrong.<br/>\nWhen I most want to jump back and bite is when I try to take a deep breath<br/>\nor two, and walk around the house muttering replies to myself, until I get<br/>\nto what *my* real problem is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said this is a &quot;voluntary attendance&quot; list.

Mohammed has to come to the<br/>\nmountain. This list is like the mountain, Mohammed can come and go at will<br/>\nand the mountain will still be here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality on a list like this, defending or seeking acceptance of a<br/>\npractice in the face of such near unanimous disapprobation is commensurate<br/>\nto recommending it. I don&#39;t know why people continue to do so when it is<br/>\nclearly a futile endeavor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people think that spanking is compatible with RU - and they try to<br/>\nexplain all the reasons why they feel justified in it (or *want* to feel<br/>\njustified), and all the special dispensations, and all the rules about it,<br/>\nto the list as if we had never heard any of it before.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have.

They stay as long as they can before deciding to<br/>\nleave because the discussions seem to be too foreign to them, but not<br/>\nwithout something that they take away that will make a difference.  And<br/>\nmaybe in the future they will return when their style of unschooling is more<br/>\nin alignment with what we believe here.  This cycle is a guess and partially<br/>\nbased on my own experience with a parenting approach that does not involve<br/>\nrewards and punishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put this out because the deeper I get into hsing, the more I believe in it<br/>\nand anyone who is interested I want to hopefully impart something to them<br/>\nthat will help them make the switch to this beautiful way for children to<br/>\nlearn.  I really see unschooling as child advocacy so I understand the<br/>\npassion.  And most of you have unschooled way longer than I have so I am<br/>\nsure that you understand better than I do that there will be those who just<br/>\nwon&#39;t be able to get down with radical unschooling.  I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>\nmaking my point but I would like to hear what you have to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":689,"nextTopicId":8245}}
