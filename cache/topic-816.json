Your advice and others&#39; helped to make this<br/>\ngo really well today. <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;As an older mom, one thing I might suggest is you  concider  not<br/>\ngiving your son too much advanced info.  He wanted to go.  As it got<br/>\ncloesr to time he played it over too much in his mind and it &#39;scared&#39;<br/>\nhim.

Let Mr Roger&#39;s do the job of<br/>\nsparking your son&#39;s interest and let the factory tour person hand out<br/>\nthe hairnet.  The fun of the factory will take over.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nOther folks suggested this also. This is one thing that I have a very<br/>\ndifficult time balancing.  For something like a Dr visit or going to a<br/>\nsitter, I don&#39;t tell him about it days in advance for that very reason,<br/>\nbut I also can&#39;t just spring it on him last minute either.  I have found<br/>\nthat the night before works best, especially if it is a morning<br/>\nappointment.  He seems to do a lot better if we go through what to<br/>\nexpect beforehand.  In the case of the hair net, I know he would have<br/>\nbeen resistant to having the factory people handle it.  In fact, when<br/>\nshe pulled out the hair nets he said he wanted to wear &quot;ours&quot;-luckily I<br/>\nhad brought them.  Honestly I often don&#39;t know which is harder for<br/>\nhim-knowing beforehand or being surprised.  He is just so painfully<br/>\nsensitive. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;One example was when my oldest child was 3, she was a biter.  I read<br/>\nmany books on how to stop her from biting and tried many things.<br/>\nincluding getting mean.   Then I read an article in Dr Spock ..Nothing<br/>\nin it worked, except  turning the page...There was ONE  small paragraph<br/>\nthat stated:  &quot;There are some children for which none of these ideas<br/>\nwill work   In those cases, you need to stop talking about it.  When a<br/>\nchild bites you can talk about how it hurt the other person and what the<br/>\nchild was feeling when she bit  but the NEXT day DO NOT mention it.  do<br/>\nnot say, &quot;Don&#39;t bite anyone today&quot; as you are walking out the door<br/>\nbecause what she hears is &quot; ...Bite anyone today&quot;  I kept my mouth shut<br/>\nand almost immediately  her  biting was over.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYES!  We found this to work really well too.  Becky Bailey says that<br/>\n&quot;what you focus on, you get more of.&quot;  We learned this when Scotty was 2<br/>\nand started spitting.  We tried everything in our gentle parenting tool<br/>\nbox to get him to stop, and nothing worked.  Finally we just completely<br/>\nignored it, and he stopped within days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again to everyone who responded.

Not something she needs to be seeing and there was no <br/>\ntalking to her about it, she is in the fighting everything phase. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  As for you calling my husband cruel... you have no idea! He is in <br/>\nthe army, he went to Iraq, he had a gun. Like is cruel. I am his <br/>\nwife, and I expect him to share all of lifes shadows with me if they <br/>\nare bothering him. He spared me a lot of details I am sure. The rest <br/>\nof us can hide from the horror of it, but it is his job to know them <br/>\nso that he can protect us from those people. I will be damned if he <br/>\nhas to sholder that burden alone. I am his wife, his equal, his <br/>\nother half, it would be cruel of him not to share! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Let me make this clear, my post was to share what I have found to <br/>\nbe true about life, that all we read and see effects us, even if we <br/>\ndo not wish them to and that as a parent I am going to protect my <br/>\nchild as best I can from those things she is not yet ready to deal <br/>\nwith. <br/>\n<br/>\n   I do not think doing away with limits all together would work for <br/>\nmy family, because like me, and many others, my daughter feels <br/>\nprotected by them and safe. I will take the limits of the gaurd <br/>\nrails on the road of life thanks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Blessings,<br/>\n  Kimberly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, pam sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Surely you don&#39;t think we would we stand by and let our children <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; harmed?

I do not believe that<br/>\nyou have to cut away all limits to be an unchooler, I believe in<br/>\nbalance and moderation, not to make my life easier, but to provide a<br/>\nhealthy home for those I love.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Kimmy,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s been discussed on this list a lot that makes a ton of sense to me is<br/>\nnecessary limits versus arbitrary (knee jerk reaction) type limits.  So what<br/>\nI try to do with my family is to question the limits I find myself setting<br/>\nto find out what&#39;s behind them, and to discuss them with my family.<br/>\nSometimes the questioning reveals nothing behind it at all.  But in the case<br/>\nof adult TV, which you bring up here, it is also a big concern of mine that<br/>\nmy kids may be exposed to and disturbed by adult content that is not their<br/>\nchoice, but is something my husband happens to have on so they look up and<br/>\nsee it because they are playing with him.  So I talk to my daughter at least<br/>\nsince she is 5.7 about the &quot;adult content TV&quot; that daddy watches, and what<br/>\ntypes of things are on there, and she is actually the one who will often<br/>\nmake sure that her Dad isn&#39;t watching anything with that type of content on<br/>\nwhile she is around (like the crime shows).  She very much enjoys watching<br/>\nsports and shows like Survivor and Fear FActor with him - she loves the<br/>\nchallenges.  At some point as she gets older doubtless she&#39;ll get interested<br/>\nin some of the other stuff, and we&#39;ll talk about what it is, any concerns I<br/>\nhave about the content, and she&#39;ll decide if and when she wants to try some<br/>\nof it, and I&#39;ll be there to try it with her, talk to her, and support her.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I believe this, though I <br/>\nhave not always. Funny how I would go to watch something thinking it <br/>\nwould not have an effect on me and then latter I found myself with <br/>\nthoughts I did not have before and could no longer avoid. Even as an <br/>\nadult I do not always know what I can handle. And I am not the only <br/>\none. <br/>\n<br/>\n My husband, in my the military, military intel infact, spends 16 <br/>\nhours of the day working double shifts doing things he can not tell <br/>\nme. He has a passion for it. And yesterday I learned more why. He <br/>\ntold me that the terrorist had beheaded their hostage and sent a tape <br/>\nif it to the news. Thats horrible I said, it made me sick think about <br/>\nabout. We talked about how it might feel to his family, wanting to <br/>\nsee it, but yet not. And then he told me the details of how they did <br/>\nit. It was not the fast death I had in my mind. I will not share it <br/>\nhere, but I will say I wish I did not know. Hubby went on to tell me <br/>\nwith anger and tears in his eyes how he can not stop thinking about <br/>\nit, how they are so close to catching the people who did it, and how <br/>\npart of him wants to get online and see it. Wants to see it... he <br/>\nthought maybe it would bring him closer on it all. After a lot of <br/>\ntalking, he desided it would cause himself more harm then good. It <br/>\ntook a grown adult days to make this choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n So I am left thinking that my choice to gaurd my 4 year old from <br/>\ncertian channels and programs on TV for the moment is right. I am the <br/>\nsheltering mother, the protecter. For the moment, what she does not <br/>\nknow she is missing will not hurt her. So HBO and other channels can <br/>\nstay blocked for her and late night tv watching will have Mommy right <br/>\nthere like a lioness making sure it will not harm my little one. <br/>\n<br/>\n I remember being little and my grandparents letting me watch The <br/>\nBlob with them, oh if onky they hadn&#39;t I would have gotten a great <br/>\ndeal more sleep growing up! LOL <br/>\n<br/>\n  Blessings,<br/>\n  Kimmy<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Sorry if others do not agree, that is ok. I do not believe that <br/>\nyou have to cut away all limits to be an unchooler, I believe in <br/>\nbalance and moderation, not to make my life easier, but to provide a <br/>\nhealthy home for those I love.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":838,"nextTopicId":899}}
