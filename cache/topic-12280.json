But yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsed to freak Ben out. Both boys went through the McD&#39;s phase. Kid&#39;s <br/>\nmeals are cheap.<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly it was for the toy---and that&#39;s OK too. Sometimes we would just <br/>\nbuy the toy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s a pretty easy way to make a little boy happy. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids hardly ever asked to go to fast food restaurants<br/>\nbefore we moved last summer.  But when we were between houses for 3 <br/>\nmonths, we<br/>\nate out almost every night.  Since then, our children have been asking <br/>\nto eat<br/>\nfast food almost every time we pass one.  They think it&#39;s normal now.  <br/>\nAnd<br/>\nthe problem is that fast food tastes good.  If you don&#39;t know (or think<br/>\nabout) what&#39;s in it, then it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for <br/>\ndinner.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, even if you do know  or think about what&#39;s in it, it can taste <br/>\nbetter. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think it&#39;s appealing to children. Period. (Not that all children <br/>\nare fans, just that it&#39;s generally appealing to them.)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n it&#39;s much yummier than fish and rice for dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, everyone in my family would choose sushi over McD&#39;s!!! So raw <br/>\nfish and sweet rice rank HIGH here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my boys are older. They&#39;ve had their fill of Happy meals and Big <br/>\nMacs. They truly don&#39;t want or need that now. But I was very, very <br/>\nwilling to give them what they wanted at the time. The most desired <br/>\n&quot;fast food&quot; restaurants now are Sakura (Japanese), Panera, Subway, El <br/>\nBurrito, & Yo! Burrito (local joints). All more expensive and further <br/>\naway than McDonald&#39;s!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, both boys have gone/are going through vegetarian spells. Cameron <br/>\n(at 20) has become weirdly fanatic about what he puts into his mouth. <br/>\nUber-health conscious. And this from a child who at one time bled <br/>\nfrench fries. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with everything: Be careful what you wish for.

In my experience (my DS and other kids around<br/>\nus), forcing the issue usually creates more trouble than just riding it<br/>\nout - it will &quot;open up&quot; again in a year or two (DS is now 8 1/2 and has<br/>\ndiscovered a love for sushi and sashimi over the last year). In the<br/>\nmeantime, provided that there are no underlying health issues going on,<br/>\njust keep providing what they will eat, offering (not requiring) things<br/>\nthat you are having, and go with the flow. Something that sometimes<br/>\nworks is to not put any of &lt;whatever&gt; on their plate but rather offer a<br/>\nsmall piece from your plate (cut it up, put it on their fork, never has<br/>\nto touch their plate) - it can overwhelm some kids to have this &quot;unknown<br/>\nthing&quot; on their own plate BUT they&#39;d gladly taste it from mom&#39;s plate.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of autonomy stuff going on at around 4 and 5 yrs old that<br/>\nplays into it as well. If you know that what you are preparing for<br/>\ndinner is likely not going to happen, go ahead and make sure you&#39;ve got<br/>\nthe alternative handy (pre-cooked rice in the fridge for example so it<br/>\ncan just be re-heated rather than having to cook it up while your own<br/>\nmeal gets cold). Also, consider activity levels and whether maybe<br/>\noffering something earlier (for example, 4:30 instead of 5:30 which is<br/>\nyour usual mealtime) might help. I noticed that when my DS was around 4<br/>\nor so, he&#39;d be getting hungry around 4 or 4:30. What was interesting was<br/>\nthat if he had a small something (crackers and nut butter, string<br/>\ncheese, whatever like that) around 4:30, he was -more- likely to have<br/>\ndinner an hour later than if he waited to eat when we sat down to<br/>\n&#39;dinner&#39; and got really super hungry. It was helpful in an &#39;appetizer&#39;<br/>\nkind of way. Something we did to avoid the &quot;multiple meal&quot; situation was<br/>\nto break meals down into smaller &#39;parts&#39; and serve some parts as<br/>\nappetizers. For instance, maybe some tofu cubes and soy sauce to dip in<br/>\n(since you mentioned tofu) while preparing a meal using more tofu or<br/>\nputting some cheese cubes on the table while shredding cheese for the<br/>\nrest of the meal, that sort of thing. That way, it&#39;s not really much in<br/>\nthe way of extra preparation (since you&#39;ve already got the cheese, tofu,<br/>\nveggies, whatever, &#39;in process&#39;), you get a little &quot;comfort&quot; knowing<br/>\nthat the kids are getting -something- foodwise into themselves, they can<br/>\nhelp themselves (which is good for autonomy loving 4 yr olds), and it<br/>\njust might &quot;appetize&quot; them into eating when dinner hits the table.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

How long does it <br/>\ntake to deschool food?<br/>\n*****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have a misconception - its not a matter of waiting until <br/>\nhe starts eating what and how you&#39;d prefer him to eat. He&#39;s learning <br/>\nto make his own decisions about food and that means he may not want <br/>\nto eat what everyone else is eating. The challenge then becomes <br/>\nfacilitating that in a way that isn&#39;t overwhelming for *you*. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there foods that can be prepared ahead of times and left in the <br/>\nfridge or on a shelf for him? Is he interested in doing some of the <br/>\nfood prep himself? Cutting tofu into cubes is pretty managable. You <br/>\nforgot to tell us which kid this is (age?) but can he use the <br/>\nmicrowave himself? We bought a microwave last summer so that Mo <br/>\ncould start preparing more food for herself - she had just turned 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nMo still likes me to do things like get cereal for her, but she&#39;ll <br/>\ndo it herself if I&#39;m busy. I&#39;ll let her know that I&#39;m happy to get <br/>\nit for her as soon as I&#39;m done and she&#39;ll either wait or get her <br/>\nown. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that really helped me get comfortable with unschooling <br/>\nfood was rethinking the whole idea of meals and *why* we eat <br/>\ntogether. In our home, George and I like to eat together, so meals <br/>\nare about connection. The kids are welcome to join us, but not <br/>\nrequired - something Ray&#39;s still getting his head around (I can <br/>\nreally eat in front of the tv? Really? Wow. I don&#39;t *have* to eat <br/>\ndinner? Really? Wow.). We always make enough for Ray to have some, <br/>\ntoo, but just put it in the fridge if he&#39;s not hungry. Mo almost <br/>\nnever eats what we do, but sometimes she&#39;ll sit with us and have a <br/>\nsnack of her own while we eat. She tends to graze.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember how much your dh is home during the day - he&#39;s a <br/>\nminister, right? I have no idea what that entails in terms of time <br/>\naway from the house, but if *he* has a need to connect as a family, <br/>\nthat can be done other ways than eating together every day. I know <br/>\nthere&#39;s a big cultural component to the shared meal, but my <br/>\nexperience with Mo is that she&#39;s almost always happy to join us at <br/>\nthe table for special events, company, etc, so I know its possible <br/>\nfor kids to &quot;get&quot; that cultural component without meals being a <br/>\ndaily ritual. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf meals are largely for the convenience of the cook, its time to <br/>\nlook at other options. Snack trays... making big amounts of favored <br/>\nfoods weekly and storing portion-sized amounts... pre-chopping <br/>\nveggies and fruits once a week... Maybe the kids would have other <br/>\nsuggestions or like to be involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of the biggest areas I started &quot;deschooling&quot; after joining <br/>\n&gt;this list was food<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its always important to keep in mind that *you* are going to need as <br/>\nmuch or more deschooling as the kids. You have decades of <br/>\npreconceptions about food and eating and meals, they only have <br/>\nyears. That&#39;s why food can be suuuuuuch a difficult issue for <br/>\nparents. We have to wade through a lifetime of our *own* food <br/>\nissues, many of which are tied up with issues of caretaking or <br/>\nabundance/scarcity or control... plus cultural stuff. Whew. <br/>\nSometimes its amazing that anyone can unschool food at all! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246155448,"authorName":"chandelle&#39;","from":"chandelle&#39; &lt;earthmother213@...&gt;","profile":"earthmama213","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food","postDate":"1175400510","msgId":22887,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGI2YmUzMDU4MDcwMzMxMjEwOHgyMzkzNTRmdWFjZDI4MTAzMDU4MGNjZkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMwNDAwNy4zNjY4NC5xbUB3ZWI2MDMxNy5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDMwNDAwNy4zNjY4NC5xbUB3ZWI2MDMxNy5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22883,"nextInTopic":22909,"prevInTime":22886,"nextInTime":22888,"topicId":12280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"well, my son is only 2 but we have the same sort of issue, except that he s only learning to speak so he can t tell me what he wants.  we always have lots of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1373759102\">well, my son is only 2 but we have the same sort of issue, except that he&#39;s<br/>\nonly learning to speak so he can&#39;t tell me what he wants.  we always have<br/>\nlots of leftovers and precooked stuff like lentils and beans and bread so<br/>\nsometimes i&#39;ll just open the fridge and let him grab what he wants...i<br/>\nalways try to keep the best stuff in the front.  i do trust overall that he<br/>\nwill know what he needs and follow his instincts as far as when to eat...he<br/>\ngoes through periods of eating every hour and other periods of hardly eating<br/>\nat all.  i worry a lot, but i mainly focus on whether his development is<br/>\nproceeding, what his temperament is like, how his sleep patterns are, etc.<br/>\nmore than his weight (although he&#39;s always been pretty &quot;average&quot; by the<br/>\ncharts), to know whether he is getting enough of the good stuff.  and i have<br/>\nlearned very well how to get more good stuff out of foods he&#39;ll always<br/>\neat...i get really good organic jams full of antioxidants like pomegranate<br/>\nand blueberry, with no sugar; whole-grain breads packed with nuts and seeds;<br/>\nlots of different nut butters; i stuff vegetables into just about<br/>\neverything; and his favorite snacks are luckily all kinds of healthy stuff<br/>\nlike frozen berries, peas and corn; rice and lentils with tofu; homemade<br/>\ngranola bars and crackers; fruit; beans; etc.  also, i have learned that i<br/>\ncan put all kinds of stuff into his daily smoothie and still have it taste<br/>\ngood - lots of different nuts and seeds, carrot juice, kale, spiruilna, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\ni don&#39;t know if that helps, but i&#39;m with ya!<br/>\n<br/>\nchandelle&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/31/07, Katharine Wise &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katharinewise@...\">katharinewise@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of the biggest areas I started &quot;deschooling&quot; after joining this list<br/>\n&gt; was food -- basically by just saying, &quot;yes&quot; to requests and offering lots of<br/>\n&gt; snacks.

Anything else, and they need to use common sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey snack constantly, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I had to <br/>\nsay, &quot;Don&#39;t eat that&quot;, &quot;Wait until after dinner&quot;, or &quot;Eat your <br/>\nvegetables!&quot;  If they don&#39;t feel like eating or eating their <br/>\nvegetables at dinner, who cares?
