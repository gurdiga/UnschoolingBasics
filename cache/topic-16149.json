I was 16 when  I pierced it ( <br/>\nmyself OUCH) but my sister at 36 got hers pierced professionally  and she <br/>\nsaid it was like a little bee sting.  Well I am MISS ALLERGY  LOL I am pretty <br/>\nmuch allergic to anything environmental so during spring summer  and fall I have <br/>\na hanky permanently attached to my nose.  The jewelry I  always used had <br/>\npretty short posts, so they didn&#39;t really stick out in your  nostril much.  But <br/>\nwhen blowing you do have to be mindful that there is a  big metal thing that can <br/>\nhurt you if you press to hard.  It took me  only one time of forgetting to <br/>\nnever do it again LOL.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 8/2/2006 1:18:02 P.M.
