I definitely needed some empathizing after this <br/>\nweekend!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour description of your son definitely sounds similar to mine.  I have pinpointed certain <br/>\nthings just by being able to write my original post and read the responses.  If he feels <br/>\nuncomfotable in a situation or doesn&#39;t know the kids then he either is very shy or very <br/>\naggressive.  For the most part if he knows the kids well, at any age, he seems to do fine.  <br/>\nMainly I guess it&#39;s if he knows the older kids well then he plays with them and it seems to <br/>\ndistract him from being aggressive with the little ones.  One exception is that he loves <br/>\nbabies and is for the most part very gentle with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a great group of unschooling familes that we hang out with occasionally and <br/>\napart from a couple of 3 year olds that he seems to be aggressive with, he gets along with <br/>\nall the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the triggers to this weekend was that he doesn&#39;t see his cousins that often <br/>\nand since the parents are constantly punishing, blaming & comparing the kids they in turn <br/>\ndo the same thing with my son and it sets him off.  Also they were getting in trouble for <br/>\ndoing some things that my son is free to do like using &quot;potty&quot; language.  Mind you this <br/>\nisn&#39;t swearing, which I don&#39;t censor either in my son, he just doesn&#39;t swear much, this is <br/>\njust kids saying &quot;poo poo head&quot; or &quot;your a fart head&quot; and all of them laughing about it only <br/>\nthe cousins get punished if the parents hear.  So again, in turn when my son uses &quot;potty&quot; <br/>\nlanguage they come and tell me or their parents in order for him to get punished like they <br/>\ndo and he will get aggressive yet again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also see him intensify if someone is insinuating that he is being &quot;mean&quot;, I think most of <br/>\nhis behaviors aren&#39;t intended to hurt or be mean, just more like playing a little too rough, <br/>\nbut if he senses someone is accusing him of being mean then the behaviors worsen or <br/>\nintensify.  That is why we too prefer to be around those that honor and respect him <br/>\nespecially when he is being intense, not giving him the impression that he&#39;s a mean <br/>\nperson, but rather just a child that is still growing and learning to socialize.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does have a gameboy and I&#39;ve noticed that here at our house if he is feeling <br/>\noverwhelmed or getting to the point of being aggressive he will get it out or go downstairs <br/>\nand get on the computer to calm down.  When we are at other people&#39;s houses then he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have that option.  Yesterday him and his two cousins all had their gameboys, but <br/>\nDamek didn&#39;t want to play his, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s time to get some new games as he seems <br/>\nbored with the ones he has.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for &quot;blathering&quot; on, this post really helped me to switch gears.

He has never been<br/>\n&gt; punished, but obviously the loss of autonomy sets him off. ~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First of all, let me empathize!:) I have a small man that has had many<br/>\n&gt; similar behaviors in those situations and it can tax your mommy<br/>\n&gt; gentleness to the core. But hang in there, it does get better and they<br/>\n&gt; learn new tools every year. Jalen is 6.5 now and our lives are<br/>\n&gt; changing drastically as far as new friendships and outings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What worked for us? Limiting contact with younger kids. It sounds<br/>\n&gt; drastic, but he really just couldn&#39;t handle much of that kind of<br/>\n&gt; stimulation. He was happy with a group of teens or older kids, but<br/>\n&gt; anyone his age or younger was a disaster for a long time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This last 6 months has been huge for us. We can go to park days with<br/>\n&gt; our homeschool group and I don&#39;t follow him around every second. He<br/>\n&gt; interacts with other kids and doesn&#39;t melt down or get angry. For the<br/>\n&gt; first year we lived here, I pretty much followed him wherever he<br/>\n&gt; wanted to go (and it was usually away from the group) or pushed him on<br/>\n&gt; the swing while the other kids played with our group.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know it can be very difficult to find ways to limit what distresses<br/>\n&gt; him, but sometimes it&#39;s necessary for his own peace and your ability<br/>\n&gt; to stay connected. I found that when we did need to be with a group<br/>\n&gt; (for the other children&#39;s sake) I had to prepare myself to simply BE<br/>\n&gt; with Jalen. It&#39;s hard to be &quot;on&quot; all the time, but that&#39;s just what<br/>\n&gt; they need. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Make sure he has his own hand-held game system if possible. Show him<br/>\n&gt; ways to connect with the other children through the game (you may have<br/>\n&gt; to sit right there the entire time) and work at prevention. There are<br/>\n&gt; times I used distraction &quot;hey Jalen, want to help me mix the cake?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; but once he was in that intense zone, there was little to do but<br/>\n&gt; remove him at times. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We used Rescue Remedy. We cuddled. We talked about what the other kids<br/>\n&gt; expected and how to help him get what he wanted. We empathized. We<br/>\n&gt; took walks and went on the swing. We dug in the dirt and jumped on the<br/>\n&gt; trampoline. In short, we tried to meet him where he was.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how many times I sat in a back bedroom while he raged<br/>\n&gt; for a while. These rages got less and less as he got older. His<br/>\n&gt; &quot;rages&quot; lately have been a simple expression of anger and a<br/>\n&gt; short-lived outburst that resolves itself in about 5 minutes. What a<br/>\n&gt; change from even a year ago!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I&#39;ve realized with Jalen, is that removal from the situation FELT<br/>\n&gt; like punishment to him. While I was only trying to protect the other<br/>\n&gt; children (and believe me, they needed protection) it felt like a total<br/>\n&gt; intrusion of his freedom to him. I&#39;m sad for that. But at the same<br/>\n&gt; time, he&#39;s learned (through time and his own development) that I<br/>\n&gt; really didn&#39;t want to stop him from doing what he wanted, I only<br/>\n&gt; needed him to give the other kids space (he has very little concept of<br/>\n&gt; personal boundaries).  This could only happen in it&#39;s own time. There<br/>\n&gt; is no way to &quot;teach&quot; this to anyone....you just love them up and wait.:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This doesn&#39;t work in every situation or for every child, but at this<br/>\n&gt; point with Jalen (when he&#39;s in the middle of being intense and unable<br/>\n&gt; to acknowledge a person yelling &quot;STOP now&quot;) I can pick him up and kiss<br/>\n&gt; his cheek, telling him &quot;I love you&quot; while redirecting his energy. That<br/>\n&gt; sweet connection really works for us now. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; While I&#39;m giving him that hug or kiss, I can then say &quot; I really need<br/>\n&gt; you to hear me right now&quot;  or &quot;I really need you to come out here with<br/>\n&gt; me for just a minute&quot; to give some space to the situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Your child may or may not be able to process the fact that the other<br/>\n&gt; kids are frustrated. It seems that the more frustration and anger gets<br/>\n&gt; directed at them, the more everything intensifies and builds. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; talked with my other children about being gentle and telling him<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;ll help him if he will give them space. Just knowing he is being<br/>\n&gt; heard, seems to diffuse the energy a bit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hang in there. I feel like I&#39;m just blathering, but I can SO readily<br/>\n&gt; relate to the challenge it is to parent an intense child. They are so<br/>\n&gt; interesting and beautiful and it hurts when other people can&#39;t see<br/>\n&gt; that beauty in them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s so cool about my little man, is he is a huge catalyst for<br/>\n&gt; growth in me. He is also AMAZING at honing in on people who are truly<br/>\n&gt; respectful of him, while shunning those that aren&#39;t. We have found<br/>\n&gt; some lovely friends who can truly honor him for who his IS. Those that<br/>\n&gt; see his beauty and give him respect even when he&#39;s getting intense are<br/>\n&gt; the people we prefer to be around. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love that he has such a sensitivity to respectful behaviors. I know<br/>\n&gt; these intense, energetic children have so much to give to the world,<br/>\n&gt; just as all our children do. Keep on trusting that and finding ways to<br/>\n&gt; meet him where he is today.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; learninginfreedom.com<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163420782,"authorName":"Julie v.","from":"&quot;Julie v.&quot; &lt;jlvw@...&gt;","profile":"vegfam3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not stopping behavior when someone says &quot;stop&quot;!","postDate":"1183400620","msgId":24823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2YmZyYysxMGRwOEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDcwNzAyMTY0OC5sNjJHbVBpWjAyMDA4NEBvbXIxMS5uZXR3b3Jrc29sdXRpb25zZW1haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24821,"nextInTopic":24824,"prevInTime":24822,"nextInTime":24824,"topicId":24818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Marji!

I agree with being present at all times with him interacting <br/>\nwith others and your suggestion of re-directing him to something that he really likes is <br/>\nthe key I think.  My dh & I were trying to re-direct, but weren&#39;t being very successful <br/>\ncoming up with something that he wanted to do otherewise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always tried to focus on the positive things that he does for others and will say &quot;wow, <br/>\nyou sure made him happy when you did that&quot;, but your suggestion of talking about the <br/>\nnegative behaviors and how they make people feel I think will also help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your assumption about him feeling inferior might be something I need to look at <br/>\nmore closely.  When he is around older kids he knows well, they have no problem playing <br/>\ntogether and working things out, when he is around older kids he doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s a <br/>\ndifferent story and that is I think when he starts to focus on the little kids wherever we are.  <br/>\nWhen we are around older kids he doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s when he starts &quot;annoying&quot; the little <br/>\nkids because he doesn&#39;t have anyone else to play with.  One exception is that he loves <br/>\nbabies!  If there is a baby around he will fawn all over them very gently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, marji &lt;marji@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 12:28 7/2/2007, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;For instance yesterday while at my mom&#39;s house his three cousins <br/>\n&gt; &gt;were there and just<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about every 5 minutes someone was telling him to please stop doing <br/>\n&gt; &gt;what he was doing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;and he would just laugh and continue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that it may be helpful for you to anticipate this kind of <br/>\n&gt; stuff from him (since you already know this about him) and be <br/>\n&gt; prepared with distractions.

He is clearly not<br/>\nready to be with littler kids than he is~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is such good advice.<br/>\nI just wanted to add that Jalen expressed to me very clearly that he<br/>\ndid NOT like little kids. He also does not like being &quot;little&quot;. He&#39;s<br/>\nthe youngest in our home, with a feeling in him that he is larger than<br/>\nlife.:) That must be SO frustrating to be trapped in a little body<br/>\nwhen your ideas and autonomy are all about BIGNESS.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves getting bigger. He talks about being taller than other<br/>\npeople, he WANTS to be grown up. This is totally opposite of all my<br/>\nother children who never want to grow up.:) <br/>\n<br/>\nHe told me he HATED a little guy that stayed with us for a little<br/>\nwhile. K was such a sweet, sweet boy, but Jalen couldn&#39;t STAND him<br/>\nbecause he was little.   I think for Jalen, these little people aren&#39;t<br/>\nat his developmental level and he just can&#39;t understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey play with his toys, or don&#39;t listen when he has a game<br/>\nidea...they&#39;re too little to understand what he is saying, but he<br/>\nexpects them to understand. When they don&#39;t act the way HE believes is<br/>\nnecessary, it angers him. He simply doesn&#39;t have the ability to be<br/>\npatient or understanding with anyone at a different developmental<br/>\nlevel (unless they are older). <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s ok. We needed to protect the younger children from Jalen and<br/>\nhim from frustration for a long time. So we limited contact. Many of<br/>\nmy friends can attest to his intensity with younger kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nLately he&#39;s been fine. I still wouldn&#39;t turn my back on him with a<br/>\nbaby or small toddler. It&#39;s just not something he can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I mean by meeting them where they are, rather than trying<br/>\nto make them be where we&#39;d like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour child can&#39;t handle certain things right now. So you just have to<br/>\nbe proactive and limit the situations that frustrate. If a gathering<br/>\nis creating a ton of negative energy, the entire point of gathering is<br/>\nlost really. He might need more time one-on-one with you or just being<br/>\nat home where his environment is more predictable.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not stopping behavior when someone says &quot;stop&quot;!","postDate":"1183397050","msgId":24820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2YmNicSs0NDk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY2YjkzNCtpYWQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24819,"nextInTopic":24821,"prevInTime":24819,"nextInTime":24821,"topicId":24818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~which he is totally opposed to, kicking and yelling and saying to me your stupid! , I m not going to listen to you! .

He has never been<br/>\npunished, but obviously the loss of autonomy sets him off. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, let me empathize!:) I have a small man that has had many<br/>\nsimilar behaviors in those situations and it can tax your mommy<br/>\ngentleness to the core. But hang in there, it does get better and they<br/>\nlearn new tools every year. Jalen is 6.5 now and our lives are<br/>\nchanging drastically as far as new friendships and outings.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked for us? Limiting contact with younger kids. It sounds<br/>\ndrastic, but he really just couldn&#39;t handle much of that kind of<br/>\nstimulation. He was happy with a group of teens or older kids, but<br/>\nanyone his age or younger was a disaster for a long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis last 6 months has been huge for us. We can go to park days with<br/>\nour homeschool group and I don&#39;t follow him around every second. He<br/>\ninteracts with other kids and doesn&#39;t melt down or get angry. For the<br/>\nfirst year we lived here, I pretty much followed him wherever he<br/>\nwanted to go (and it was usually away from the group) or pushed him on<br/>\nthe swing while the other kids played with our group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it can be very difficult to find ways to limit what distresses<br/>\nhim, but sometimes it&#39;s necessary for his own peace and your ability<br/>\nto stay connected. I found that when we did need to be with a group<br/>\n(for the other children&#39;s sake) I had to prepare myself to simply BE<br/>\nwith Jalen. It&#39;s hard to be &quot;on&quot; all the time, but that&#39;s just what<br/>\nthey need. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure he has his own hand-held game system if possible. Show him<br/>\nways to connect with the other children through the game (you may have<br/>\nto sit right there the entire time) and work at prevention. There are<br/>\ntimes I used distraction &quot;hey Jalen, want to help me mix the cake?&quot;<br/>\nbut once he was in that intense zone, there was little to do but<br/>\nremove him at times. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used Rescue Remedy. We cuddled. We talked about what the other kids<br/>\nexpected and how to help him get what he wanted. We empathized. We<br/>\ntook walks and went on the swing. We dug in the dirt and jumped on the<br/>\ntrampoline. In short, we tried to meet him where he was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how many times I sat in a back bedroom while he raged<br/>\nfor a while. These rages got less and less as he got older. His<br/>\n&quot;rages&quot; lately have been a simple expression of anger and a<br/>\nshort-lived outburst that resolves itself in about 5 minutes. What a<br/>\nchange from even a year ago!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve realized with Jalen, is that removal from the situation FELT<br/>\nlike punishment to him. While I was only trying to protect the other<br/>\nchildren (and believe me, they needed protection) it felt like a total<br/>\nintrusion of his freedom to him. I&#39;m sad for that. But at the same<br/>\ntime, he&#39;s learned (through time and his own development) that I<br/>\nreally didn&#39;t want to stop him from doing what he wanted, I only<br/>\nneeded him to give the other kids space (he has very little concept of<br/>\npersonal boundaries).  This could only happen in it&#39;s own time. There<br/>\nis no way to &quot;teach&quot; this to anyone....you just love them up and wait.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t work in every situation or for every child, but at this<br/>\npoint with Jalen (when he&#39;s in the middle of being intense and unable<br/>\nto acknowledge a person yelling &quot;STOP now&quot;) I can pick him up and kiss<br/>\nhis cheek, telling him &quot;I love you&quot; while redirecting his energy. That<br/>\nsweet connection really works for us now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I&#39;m giving him that hug or kiss, I can then say &quot; I really need<br/>\nyou to hear me right now&quot;  or &quot;I really need you to come out here with<br/>\nme for just a minute&quot; to give some space to the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour child may or may not be able to process the fact that the other<br/>\nkids are frustrated. It seems that the more frustration and anger gets<br/>\ndirected at them, the more everything intensifies and builds. I&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked with my other children about being gentle and telling him<br/>\nthey&#39;ll help him if he will give them space. Just knowing he is being<br/>\nheard, seems to diffuse the energy a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there. I feel like I&#39;m just blathering, but I can SO readily<br/>\nrelate to the challenge it is to parent an intense child. They are so<br/>\ninteresting and beautiful and it hurts when other people can&#39;t see<br/>\nthat beauty in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s so cool about my little man, is he is a huge catalyst for<br/>\ngrowth in me. He is also AMAZING at honing in on people who are truly<br/>\nrespectful of him, while shunning those that aren&#39;t. We have found<br/>\nsome lovely friends who can truly honor him for who his IS. Those that<br/>\nsee his beauty and give him respect even when he&#39;s getting intense are<br/>\nthe people we prefer to be around. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love that he has such a sensitivity to respectful behaviors. I know<br/>\nthese intense, energetic children have so much to give to the world,<br/>\njust as all our children do. Keep on trusting that and finding ways to<br/>\nmeet him where he is today.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Not stopping behavior when someone  says &quot;stop&quot;!","postDate":"1183394898","msgId":24819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwNzAyMTY0OC5sNjJHbVBpWjAyMDA4NEBvbXIxMS5uZXR3b3Jrc29sdXRpb25zZW1haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY2YjkzNCtpYWQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGY2YjkzNCtpYWQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24818,"nextInTopic":24820,"prevInTime":24818,"nextInTime":24820,"topicId":24818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It seems to be getting worse and dh and I <br/>\nare just at a loss as to how to handle these situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance yesterday while at my mom&#39;s house his three cousins were there and just <br/>\nabout every 5 minutes someone was telling him to please stop doing what he was doing <br/>\nand he would just laugh and continue.  One example was when his cousin (also age 5) was <br/>\nplaying his gameboy and ds was watching him, then for some reason ds kept smacking <br/>\nthe gameboy while his cousin was playing it which was obviously upsetting to the cousin.  <br/>\nDs also had his gameboy there, but didn&#39;t want to play it.  When this happened I came over <br/>\nand said &quot;Hayden asked you to stop hitting his gameboy, when someone says stop you <br/>\nneed to stop right now&quot;, he just laughed and did it again.  When this happens I feel I have <br/>\nno alternative but to remove him from the situation, which he is totally opposed to, <br/>\nkicking and yelling and saying to me &quot;your stupid!&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to you!&quot;.  He <br/>\nhas never been punished, but obviously the loss of autonomy sets him off.  All I try to do <br/>\nis talk to him in as few words as possible why he needs to stop when someone tells him to <br/>\nstop, but he doesn&#39;t want to hear it.  When this happens all he wants to do is run back and  <br/>\ncontinue with what he was doing, he isn&#39;t in the mindframe for having a conversation, so <br/>\nin the end it just makes things worse and doesn&#39;t help, but I also feel that it&#39;s not an <br/>\noption for him to continue with what he was doing, what are the alternatives? <br/>\n<br/>\nHe will also hit toys out of kids hands if it is something he wants to play with.  I try to <br/>\nempathize with him about how much he wants the toy and when the child is done with it <br/>\nthen he can play with it, but he will just continute to chase the kid around trying to hit it <br/>\nout of their hands (he did this with his 2 year old cousin yesterday). Again I feel like I have <br/>\nto physically stop him because the other child was being hurt.  Some of the same <br/>\nbehaviors happen here at home with his little brother (20 months), but it&#39;s easier to just <br/>\nre-direct him or talk to him because we don&#39;t have to physically remove him.  Sometimes <br/>\nwe just pick up the 20 month old and move him somewhere else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part he seems to listen to kids older than him, but not kids younger than him <br/>\nthat he can &quot;overpower&quot;.  Him and his cousin who is 7 seemed to get along fine, but he <br/>\nwas constantly doing things to the 5 year old and 2 year old.  Not sure why this is.  Also <br/>\nwhen we have the neighbor kids over he gets along fine with the older ones, but him and <br/>\nthe 4 year old next door seem to always have problems?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24825,"nextTopicId":24832}}
