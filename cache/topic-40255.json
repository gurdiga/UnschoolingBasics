There are innumerable examples of surgeons nicking<br/>\nbladder, bowel, ovaries, even baby with the scalpels.  A natural birth<br/>\nmay give a tear (tiny compared to one with an episiotomy), but that is<br/>\nnothing to the number of incredibly dangerous and sometimes fatal<br/>\ninfections in a hospital setting.  I had an 8lb baby with only some skid<br/>\nmarks and no tearing.  My friend had a 9lb, 4oz baby with no tearing -<br/>\nthank you midwives!<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is one of my small number of soapboxes - I&#39;ll step down with two<br/>\nthings: one is that obs/surgeons are great at the 1-5% of all births<br/>\nwhich truly need a c-section, but lousy at the 95%+ of normal births.<br/>\nThe midwives who help ladies give birth outside of hospital settings are<br/>\nusually in the 0.7-1% rate for c-sections.  In hospital sections number<br/>\nin the 25-50% because surgeries are more expensive (more money for<br/>\nhospitals) and much more prestigious. Nothing like waiting 12-24 hours<br/>\nfor a doctor to do nothing.<br/>\nThe second thing is that birth is the most incredible high a person can<br/>\nexperience.  This incredible release of a cocktail of hormones (with<br/>\noxytocin leading the list) helps to decrease pain and increase bonding<br/>\nfor the mom, and bring her powerfully in the biological line of going<br/>\nfrom a singular woman to a multiple focused mother.  Animals who have<br/>\nhad sections do not bond with their babies, and the babies die.  <br/>\nI could go on, but if you are considering a section simply to comply<br/>\nwith your doc or your scedule, don&#39;t listen to me, just watch &quot;the<br/>\nbusiness of being born&quot; made by Ricky Lake after her hospital birth, or<br/>\ntalk to a doula.  You may be surprized at how incredible this experience<br/>\nis!  And yes, I have two kids birthed with midwives out of a hospital<br/>\nsetting, without meds.  These were the most trying and powerfully<br/>\nsatisfying experiences of my life.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe unschool or homeschool our kids to help them grow.  Take a look at<br/>\noptions for birthing, too!  They say in the video that people spend more<br/>\ntime researching what kind of car to buy than researching where to have<br/>\na baby.  Hm, infant mortality rates are higher in the USA than ANY<br/>\nindustrialized nation in the world.  What&#39;s up with that?<br/>\n <br/>\nblessings and peace,<br/>\nQuinn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://toolbar.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://toolbar.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt;  Make your computer carbon-neutral (free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Care2.com&quot;&gt;http://www.Care2.com&lt;/a&gt; Green Living, Human Rights and more - 8 million members!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40244,"nextTopicId":40256}}
