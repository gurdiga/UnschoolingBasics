My youngest <br/>\nwas the opposite...&quot;advanced&quot; was something I heard a lot from the <br/>\nteachers, when she was in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut disabled as compared to what? Gifted by whose standards? <br/>\nAren&#39;t they in fact just being themselves? Why does the school <br/>\nsystem think we all have to move through life at the same pace as <br/>\nothers our own age? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know anything about cars, except how to drive one. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow a Toyota from a Mazda, let alone all the different models. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what a carborator looks like, I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s <br/>\nfunction is and I don&#39;t think I even spelled it correctly. <br/>\nMy son does though. He knows much more about how a car works than I <br/>\ndo. He can look at most cars and tell what model it is and he knows <br/>\nthe names of all the new cars that are coming out. He knows what the <br/>\nnames of most car parts are and their function also. Does that make <br/>\nhim gifted and me learning disabled? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle child knows a lot about horses. She knows how to ride <br/>\nthem, feed them, groom them. She knows the names of the different <br/>\nbreeds and is learning how to train them. Me? I know nothing about <br/>\nhorses except that when I get to close to one, I sneeze. Is she <br/>\ngifted in horses? Am I learning disabled in horses? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that children are &quot;rewarded&quot; with the gifted label <br/>\nwhen they can learn within the way the schools are designed for them <br/>\nto learn. Children are degraded with the learning disabled label <br/>\nwhen they don&#39;t. That has nothing to do with the real world. When a <br/>\nschool fails to teach a child they way that child needs to be <br/>\ntaught, the child is labled a failure, when in actuality, the <br/>\nresponsibility should be on the school. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my youngest was still in school, she&#39;d be beyond children her <br/>\nage, but is she gifted? No, she&#39;s just being herself. She&#39;s exactly <br/>\nwhere she should be, just being Jacqueline. <br/>\nAs a matter of fact, I&#39;m thrilled for her that she&#39;ll never be <br/>\nlabeled &quot;gifted&quot;. <br/>\nI would never want her to think that living down to (not living up <br/>\nto) a failing, broken down school system is what makes one &quot;gifted&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want my children to repect their individuality and go through life <br/>\nat their own pace, not being compared to others. <br/>\n <br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foreverparents.com\">http://foreverparents.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202237913,"authorName":"Melanie Ilsley","from":"&quot;Melanie Ilsley&quot; &lt;us5@...&gt;","profile":"melanieilsley","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 935","postDate":"1147951846","msgId":13368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0aGx0Nis5aDhpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1ZGI2NGNjMDYwNTE3MTIzOGcxZjZiYTI0NnM0ZWI4NDljZTIyZmYxNzhmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13365,"nextInTopic":13376,"prevInTime":13367,"nextInTime":13369,"topicId":13342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Some people may not get support from this list, but being new to unschooling, I have.

I&#39;ve been on this list since it began.  I&#39;m a<br/>\nmoderator.  I know a bunch of these people personally. If I came on and said<br/>\nthat I told my daughter Rowan that she had to be married before she could<br/>\nhave a baby, believe me, people would take that up for discussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;ll keep reading about unschooling - if not here, on other lists<br/>\nand sites.  It&#39;s a wonderful way to live.   ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 935","postDate":"1147896287","msgId":13343,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0ZnZrditkZTgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1ZGI2NGNjMDYwNTE3MTIzOGcxZjZiYTI0NnM0ZWI4NDljZTIyZmYxNzhmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13342,"nextInTopic":13351,"prevInTime":13342,"nextInTime":13344,"topicId":13342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Natalie, I m sorry you feel personally attacked and criticized.
