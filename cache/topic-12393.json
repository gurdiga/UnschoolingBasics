Just this morning I had a LONG conversation with a lady who<br/>\npicked up a sewing machine that I freecycled.  She saw Mary Elayne and asked<br/>\nif my kids were home sick and I said that we homeschooled.  First words out<br/>\nof her mouth, &quot;What curriculum do you use.&quot;  So I thought about this &quot;It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter&quot; thread and so instead of my usual &quot;we do interested led<br/>\nlearning&quot; I said, &quot;Oh we don&#39;t use a curriculum at all.  Kids are going to<br/>\nlearn what they need to learn when they need to learn it.&quot;  Then we had a<br/>\nnearly 40 minute discussion (quite civil) about learning and schools and how<br/>\nI came to trust my children to learn what they need to learn when they need<br/>\nto learn it.  It dawned on me that she is not DCFS or CPS or the school<br/>\nboard or the truant officer.  And she didn&#39;t strike me as the type that<br/>\nwould go out of her way to call DCFS, CPS, the school board or the truant<br/>\nofficer and when she drove out of my yard with her new sewing machine<br/>\nwhatever happened with our conversation would be of little impact on my<br/>\nchildren (but hopefully it would open her eyes to other possibilities for<br/>\nher children :) )  She actually thought it was pretty cool and when I didn&#39;t<br/>\nshow any remorse in &quot;being stuck home with my kids&quot; and that I enjoy being<br/>\nwith them she backed off on the &quot;why would I do something like that line.&quot;<br/>\nI wonder if I even got her wheels turning.  She (of course) asked about<br/>\nsocialization and I asked her if she had talked to anyone today.  Store<br/>\nclerks, friends on the phone, her children, me?  I said, that is all<br/>\nsocialization.  I said that the beauty of homeschooling is that my kids are<br/>\nable to socialize with all kinds of people of all ages and backgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo either she thinks I&#39;m pretty cool because I homeschool my kids and follow<br/>\ntheir lead or either she thinks I&#39;m that crazy woman with the weedy front<br/>\nyard wearing the hippy broomstick skirt sucking down Chakra tea.
