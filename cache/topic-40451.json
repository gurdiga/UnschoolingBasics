I agree that her feelings are legitimate. When she was in the private school last year, half the time she didn&#39;t want to be there, thought it was too much work but it was very relaxed compared to public school. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe fears is that it will be day after day at home, with no friends and no fun, and we&#39;ve talked about that and continue to do so, off and on. She may have other fears, too and I&#39;ll ask her. I have taken her to a nearby elementary school, since we have school choice and can pick where she goes. She liked it. She likes the idea of knowing what to expect, I think, which is fine of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nTracy<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Joyce Fetteroll <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 15, 2009 5:55 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Laws and how to find them<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Jun 14, 2009, at 3:36 PM, tracyaustin30 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; We live in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n  Specifically for MA, go to:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mhla.org/\">http://mhla.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  They have several pages on getting started.

I&#39;ve also found <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ahem.info/index.htm\">http://www.ahem.info/index.htm</a> to be a good resource.  In MA it really depends on your school district.  It&#39;s a great idea to be aware of the state laws so you can be aware of what your town should be asking you for and what you are not really obligated to provide.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree with Joyce that you should take very seriously your daughter&#39;s desire to stay in school and adress it respectfully.  Take this summer to really enjoy each other and have lots of fun.   Keeping her home against her will isn&#39;t a great option.   Providing her with a wonderful nurturing envionment full of options to explore the world will help her want to stay home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think agreeing on a trial period is a good way to go.   My daughter and I agreed to try unschooling for a year and then decide if she wanted to go into high school.   We both knew that would never happen but it helped us both to not be afraid and to have something to tell family before we were really comfortable explaining what we were up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso check out the Northeast Unschooling conference.  Lots of fun and a chance for your daughter to meet other kids with crazy moms : ) <br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Laws and how to find them","postDate":"1245059712","msgId":40452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyQzdFQURDLTA4REEtNDM3Ni1CRDNELTEzNDZBQ0ZGMTVDOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxM2pmait0MGE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxM2pmait0MGE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40451,"nextInTopic":40454,"prevInTime":40451,"nextInTime":40453,"topicId":40451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
