I am just advertising myself. <br/>\n  I work as an Indenpendent Beauty Consultant for Mary Kay. I love my <br/>\n  job because I get to work from home, but because I am just starting <br/>\n  out (3 months) I can always use more customers! Not only do we just <br/>\n  sell great products we also offer parties. There are many types but <br/>\n  the most common is the facial party. You get to try all of our great <br/>\n  skin care products right in you own home. And its all for free. For <br/>\n  hosting a party you recieve a free gift and earn free products. The <br/>\n  way you earn free products is by the total you sell at the party is <br/>\n  the way I base the amonut. Just recentally at a party with only four <br/>\n  women the hostess earned $40.00 in free products. She earned an <br/>\n  additional $20.00 from outside orders from here work. We have <br/>\n  wonderful products that really work. I know I use them everyday. So <br/>\n  does my whole family now. Please e-mail me if you would like to host <br/>\n  a party or just have any questions. I do individual consults too. You <br/>\n  can try dozens of samples and its all free. The only you pay for is <br/>\n  the products if any you choose to buy. And just because you all have <br/>\n  helped me so much in homeschooling my daughter you can all recieve <br/>\n  10% off anything and everything you order. Please tell anyone you <br/>\n  know too. Its a real big help. Its so hard to get my name out there <br/>\n  but hopefully this will help.
