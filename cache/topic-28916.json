So our routine <br/>\nprobably looks a lot different than others...but it seems to me that <br/>\nevery unschooler is a lot different that others, so I don&#39;t know how <br/>\nhelpful THAT was. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do try to make sure that late evening are calmer in our house, <br/>\nbecause there are so many of us that it&#39;s just respectful to honor <br/>\nthe wishes of the little people. Avari is two, and she will be <br/>\nexhausted and if someone is still movin&#39; and groovin&#39; it&#39;s hard for <br/>\nher to sleep. So I asked the older kids for two hours every evening <br/>\nwhere we just chill. They were happy to oblige (yeah, because <br/>\neveryone gets private time with the littles asleep!) So we usually <br/>\nhave baths or wash our hands and face with lavender water, put on <br/>\njammies, brush teeth. We have piles of our favorite books on the <br/>\nfloor right next to the beds, and we do a traveling story time. We <br/>\nusually start off in the boys room, with everyone crowded around I <br/>\nSpy books, and sometimes How it Works. Then we head downstairs to the <br/>\ngirls room to do her little Maisy and Blue&#39;s Clues stories. We <br/>\nsnuggle and kiss, and about half of the time lay down with her until <br/>\nshe&#39;s asleep. Sam and Dan are very understanding that I snuggle with <br/>\nthem a little bit, then head downstairs to snuggle the girls, then <br/>\nbounce around. Avari and Breanna, I travel back and forth, and <br/>\nusually while I&#39;m checking on the other one, kissing and snuggling, <br/>\nthe other starts dozing. So I wake them for one last kiss and sweet <br/>\ndreams, and they go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMealtimes, I make one big meal each for breakfast lunch and dinner. <br/>\nThey eat what they want, but I usually only make stuff most people <br/>\nlike. Anyone who doesn&#39;t like it can reheat leftovers from another <br/>\nnight or make ramen or something. We usually do eat together, but the <br/>\nolder kids will be running in and out because they are involved in a <br/>\ncraft or show. There&#39;s usually at least one person reading at the <br/>\ntable. They usually WANT to all be together. But if they don&#39;t want <br/>\nto eat, they can always come in later and get something. We do <br/>\nalways have a snack tray out, after about four pm if they come in <br/>\nI&#39;ll remind them that dinner is in two hours, this is what we&#39;re <br/>\nhaving, so that they are making educated choices about if they want <br/>\nto fill up or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoats? We have weather check. It&#39;s just something we&#39;ve done since <br/>\nour oldest was little. I always hated my mom saying &#39;get a coat!&#39; <br/>\nwhen I wasn&#39;t cold. Old people get cold faster, that&#39;s just a <br/>\nfact ;-) Okay, maybe not, but I do know that my kids feel temperature <br/>\ndifferently than I do. So, we have weather checks. They know who <br/>\nfeels like them, so if Emily says it&#39;s good for long sleeve t-shirts <br/>\nand no coat, Rachel can wear shortsleeves and Sam will want a sweat <br/>\nshirt, etc etc. I always offer a coat to the littles, and usually we <br/>\nhave spares in the truck. JIC. They just learn. At this point, the <br/>\nlittles will holler &quot;I&#39;m doin the weather check!!!!!&quot; so it&#39;s working <br/>\nout well, everyone running around in their various states of undress <br/>\nlaughing about being cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like what someone else said. That when you are first starting that <br/>\nyou start by letting go of the little stuff. Say yes more often. When <br/>\nthat succeeds, you&#39;ll see that it really does work. And then you&#39;ll <br/>\nbe happy with letting go of more. Three seems like very young, I <br/>\nknow, but Dan was almost three when we started unschooling, and he <br/>\nwas the first child I ever had to said to me &quot;Momma, I tired, I get <br/>\nin bed now.&quot;<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/19/2008 9:55:35 A.M.

I can be playful with the child and still stay within this<br/>\ncalm state. The wired child in my house needs to be allowed to go with<br/>\nher wired state for a bit- I let her jump or do somersaults on the<br/>\nbed, dance party, whatever, while at the same time getting pjs,<br/>\ntalking about bedtime, etc, but with a smile and a feeling of approval<br/>\nof her energy state, which is so different than mine. We inadvertently<br/>\nstarted a bedtime tradition in which one of us says, &quot;mommy (or<br/>\nanyone), guess what?&quot; mommy (or whomever) replies, of course, &quot;what?&quot;<br/>\nand then the first person runs and jumps onto the bed in a fancy or<br/>\nfunny way. After about 10 or 20 of these, and laughing together, we<br/>\ncan hug, tickle, and I might start to rub her back. Throughout the<br/>\nprocess, I might be mentioning how tired I am, and how it&#39;s really<br/>\ntime to snuggle in bed, etc. (softly, and with a dreamy smile and a<br/>\nsigh) and on purpose yawning every now and then. Then, eventually, I<br/>\nmight say, &quot;you pick out a book, or I will pick one out in 10, 9, 8,...&quot;<br/>\nThis all occurs on our great big california king sized bed. I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if this works for you to put your child to bed in YOUR bed, but<br/>\nit could just as easily happen in the child&#39;s bedroom- just that our<br/>\nlittle shares a room with a sis 9 years older, so that is her<br/>\nterritory at bedtime. Some people light a candle, but I am never that<br/>\ntogether. Some TELL a story in a dreamy bedtime voice, but again, I am<br/>\nnever so together as to memorize a story. We might play a short card<br/>\ngame in bed or just read stories. We use non foaming, non flouride<br/>\ntoothpaste (no spitting required), so brushing and flossing teeth<br/>\nhappens in bed, right before story. I read a story and maybe rub her<br/>\nback a bit, and she is out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe important thing with little children is that they internally<br/>\nrespond to your inner state. You must come to bedtime with a great<br/>\ninner calm and feeling of almost magic, like a wizard or fairy princess. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband doesn&#39;t get this. With great energy he loudly repeats over<br/>\nand over, Come on- it&#39;s time for bed! let&#39;s get you into bed! get your<br/>\npajamas on! brush your teeth! come on now! etc etc. More stimulating<br/>\nthan calming. He reads a whole pile of stories, once he can finally<br/>\nget her to hold still- trying to &quot;read her to sleep&quot;, and after about<br/>\n10 he often falls asleep with her still awake, and after 3 or 4 times<br/>\nthe length of time it takes me to lull her to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this turned out so long, hope it helps-<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help with my deschooling progress!","postDate":"1200882518","msgId":28939,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1ODgxMi43ODMwOC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZtdWhmZis3NjE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28938,"nextInTopic":28952,"prevInTime":28938,"nextInTime":28940,"topicId":28916,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks so much Ren, I always love to hear what you have to say - you know, wisdom, experience and all that for us newbies :o).

A <br/>\nwarm drink, dimmed lights, soothing music, snuggling with mom are all <br/>\nat the top of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso changing your goal from &quot;getting wired up tired kids to go to bed&quot; <br/>\nto &quot;making the environment peaceful and restful and soothing&quot; might be <br/>\nbetter. Change the focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I want to know what mealtimes look like,<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent on different days. Some meals at the kitchen table. Some in <br/>\nthe den around the coffee table. Some in our own rooms in bed. Lots of <br/>\nsnacking. Often on the porch or deck in nice weather. Occasional formal <br/>\ndining rooms meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften it depends on the meal being served. Tacos are better at the <br/>\ntable. &lt;g&gt; Soup and bread are common around the coffee table. Guests <br/>\nare almost always served at one of the tables. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBen gets in between 6:00 and 6:15, so I try to have supper ready at <br/>\n6:30. Everyone likes supper together at the kitchen table, but we <br/>\nsometimes carry it to the den if there&#39;s a board game to play or a <br/>\nmovie to watch together. But breakfast and lunch are almost always <br/>\nlooser---with folks up and hungry at different times.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I want to know how<br/>\nyou get them to put their coats on, etc. when you have somewhere you <br/>\nhave to be,<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI just pack the car with coats and sweatshirts.

Do you know how they <br/>\nfeel? My mother&#39;s *always* cold. 79 degrees is &quot;a little chilly.&quot; &lt;G&gt; <br/>\nBoth of my boys like it slightly cooler than I do. But if I let them <br/>\nrun around outside in the snow (which NEVER happens, but it DID snow <br/>\nlast week in Columbia, SC---while we were in Florida!) with bare feet, <br/>\nI know they will be inside shortly for a warm bath and hot chocolate. <br/>\nAnd the next time they go out, they&#39;ll put TWO pairs of socks on under <br/>\ntheir shoes. &lt;G&gt; They&#39;re learning how the world works. My telling them <br/>\nhow to deal with it will only delay their learning.

So our routine probably looks a lot different than others...but it seems to me that every unschooler is a lot","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1848407938\">I have seven kids, ages 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 4 and 2. So our routine  <br/>\nprobably looks a lot different than others...but it seems to me that  <br/>\nevery unschooler is a lot different that others, so I don&#39;t know how  <br/>\nhelpful THAT was. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do try to make sure that late evening are calmer in our house,  <br/>\nbecause there are so many of us that it&#39;s just respectful to honor  <br/>\nthe wishes of the little people. Avari is two, and she will be  <br/>\nexhausted and if someone is still movin&#39; and groovin&#39; it&#39;s hard for  <br/>\nher to sleep. So I asked the older kids for two hours every evening  <br/>\nwhere we just chill. They were happy to oblige (yeah, because  <br/>\neveryone gets private time with the littles asleep!) So we usually  <br/>\nhave baths or wash our hands and face with lavender water, put on  <br/>\njammies, brush teeth. We have piles of our favorite books on the  <br/>\nfloor right next to the beds, and we do a traveling story time. We  <br/>\nusually start off in the boys room, with everyone crowded around I  <br/>\nSpy books, and sometimes How it Works. Then we head downstairs to the  <br/>\ngirls room to do her little Maisy and Blue&#39;s Clues stories. We  <br/>\nsnuggle and kiss, and about half of the time lay down with her until  <br/>\nshe&#39;s asleep. Sam and Dan are very understanding that I snuggle with  <br/>\nthem a little bit, then head downstairs to snuggle the girls, then  <br/>\nbounce around. Avari and Breanna, I travel back and forth, and  <br/>\nusually while I&#39;m checking on the other one, kissing and snuggling,  <br/>\nthe other starts dozing. So I wake them for one last kiss and sweet  <br/>\ndreams, and they go to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nMealtimes, I make one big meal each for breakfast lunch and dinner.  <br/>\nThey eat what they want, but I usually only make stuff most people  <br/>\nlike. Anyone who doesn&#39;t like it can reheat leftovers from another  <br/>\nnight or make ramen or something. We usually do eat together, but the  <br/>\nolder kids will be running in and out because they are involved in a  <br/>\ncraft or show. There&#39;s usually at least one person reading at the  <br/>\ntable. They usually WANT to all be together. But if they don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto eat, they can always come in later and get something.  We do  <br/>\nalways have a snack tray out, after about four pm if they come in  <br/>\nI&#39;ll remind them that dinner is in two hours, this is what we&#39;re  <br/>\nhaving, so that they are making educated choices about if they want  <br/>\nto fill up or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoats? We have weather check. It&#39;s just something we&#39;ve done since  <br/>\nour oldest was little. I always hated my mom saying &#39;get a coat!&#39;  <br/>\nwhen I wasn&#39;t cold. Old people get cold faster, that&#39;s just a  <br/>\nfact ;-) Okay, maybe not, but I do know that my kids feel temperature  <br/>\ndifferently than I do. So, we have weather checks. They know who  <br/>\nfeels like them, so if Emily says it&#39;s good for long sleeve t-shirts  <br/>\nand no coat, Rachel can wear shortsleeves and Sam will want a sweat  <br/>\nshirt, etc etc. I always offer a coat to the littles, and usually we  <br/>\nhave spares in the truck. JIC. They just learn. At this point, the  <br/>\nlittles will holler &quot;I&#39;m doin the weather check!!!!!&quot; so it&#39;s working  <br/>\nout well, everyone running around in their various states of undress  <br/>\nlaughing about being cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like what someone else said. That when you are first starting that  <br/>\nyou start by letting go of the little stuff. Say yes more often. When  <br/>\nthat succeeds, you&#39;ll see that it really does work. And then you&#39;ll  <br/>\nbe happy with letting go of more. Three seems like very young, I  <br/>\nknow, but Dan was almost three when we started unschooling, and he  <br/>\nwas the first child I ever had to said to me &quot;Momma, I tired, I get  <br/>\nin bed now.&quot;<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 1/19/2008 9:55:35 A.M.

I have a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been unschooling since the start, and 3 big kids that I didn&#39;t at ALL until <br/>\n just almost 2 years ago for the 18 year old and since Nov. for the 15 year <br/>\nold.  The 20 year old no longer lives at home with me. <br/>\n <br/>\nbedtime: my kids love routine. so, we eat dinner at around 5, watch tv at  <br/>\nthe same time usually (we are all into bindi the jungle girl right now!), and i  <br/>\nturn on the dim lights we have. then, by around 6, we head off to the bath,  <br/>\nwhere we&#39;ll have a bubble bath, or play with toys we froze into ice <br/>\ncontainers,  or some such thing. then after a warm and cozy bath, we get on jammies, <br/>\nwatch an  episode of peep and the big wide world, lol, with the lights off, <br/>\ncuddling, then  julian goes to play a video game with papa while i nurse julia to <br/>\nsleep (around  7), then we switch, and julian comes up by 8ish, and io nurse <br/>\nhim to sleep. <br/>\n <br/>\nthe routine we have is flexible, of course, and its changed a lot over the  <br/>\ncourse of the 5 years julian&#39;s been here :) but since my kids do really well  <br/>\nwith routine (not structure), this has been really good for us. really, its <br/>\njust  looking for their cues as they become tired, and supporting that by <br/>\nsoftening  the lights and staying regular - not all kids of course are like this, but <br/>\nwe  can all follow our children&#39;s cues. noticing them and responding to them <br/>\nis the  biggest step (vs an imposed bedtime, we work with their body clock, <br/>\nwhich is  very much like the sun clock).<br/>\n <br/>\nJackets - well, we live in calif., in the southern part, so its not often  <br/>\nneeded, but i keep jackets in the car, tell them or show them what the weather  <br/>\nis like and then make sure there is time - and lots of it - to discuss the <br/>\ncoat,  the weather, if we need one or want one, the bird that just flew by, if <br/>\nits cold  up in that airplane, lol, you get the idea. lots of time, give as much <br/>\nas  possible all the time, so when you *are* rushed, they know they are heard <br/>\nat  other times and it all seems to balance out. patience, time, enjoy each <br/>\nbit of  it as much as you can - it helps sooo much, as the kids know their <br/>\nneeds and  wants are just as important as yours. <br/>\n <br/>\nmealtimes...lol...um, we do eat in a more routine manner than some  families, <br/>\ni&#39;m sure, but we are complicated by 2 young adult kids that have heavy  <br/>\nsocial priorities and my dh, who has only semi-regular hours. we work best with  <br/>\nthis &quot;method&quot;: I make one main meal like thing a day that works for lunch or  <br/>\ndinner, and the big kids and DH eat that, along with myself. If the little ones  <br/>\nlike it, they eat it too, of course, but Julian is very discerning at this  <br/>\npoint, so dinners for the kids is usually a bit different. But we have <br/>\nbreakfast  of cereals or toast and juice, once in a while, if they ask, ice cream :)  <br/>\nPumpkin pie is a GREAT breakfast - eat your veggies! lol! they usually want to <br/>\n eat within an hour of waking up, and they wake around 7 usually. I make a  <br/>\nmidmorning snack for them, usually fruit or crackers, or both, and then we eat <br/>\na  lunch around 1. That is often quesadillas, or hotdogs, raw veggies, fish or <br/>\n chicken, and often it&#39;s the biggest meal of the day. Dinner, as I said <br/>\nabove,  around 5, and varies from oatmeal to cold cereal, to a huge, traditional <br/>\nthing.  Homemade pizza is a big one here, too, for all meals :) <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you are feeling apprehensive about giving them so much control so fast,  <br/>\ngo more slowly. Say yes as often as possible, just a few times more a day. <br/>\nAllow  for time and talking and exploring things.  Look over what they eat after a <br/>\n week, not per meal or per day even. Maybe even a month. Read a lot of stuff <br/>\non  this style of being, listen a lot, ask tons of questions, but above all, <br/>\nbe with  your kids and really keep tuning in with them. It&#39;s a wonderful life, <br/>\ntruly -  and that anxiety will die down, I swear! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren in So. Cal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Start the year off right.

I LOVE the Abraham Hicks quote!  I am also part of an AP yahoo group here in Calgary, and it&#39;s amazing how the thinking kind of just stops when kids hit around 3, when their &quot;attitude&quot; starts and people start choosing traditional discipline over their hearts.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  That thought is the reason I&#39;m writing really.  I love what I read about giving our children freedom, and I&#39;m all for it to keep them away from school and let them direct their learning, but I haven&#39;t read much about the years before - up to age 5 or so I guess, or perhaps even 4.  My girls are 3 and a bit right now and life just feels hard most days.  They are very busy, very opinionated, very determined, very self-sufficient, and while these are all qualities that I admire and that I know will serve them very well throughout their lives (so I have no desire to change them), I still feel like I&#39;m parenting much like I was parented, minus the spanking.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m guess I&#39;m learning that unschooling is so much more than just keeping my kids out of school, and yet I don&#39;t really know what that looks like.  I would SO love to hang out at Sandra&#39;s house, or Joyce&#39;s house, or Ren&#39;s house, just to get a feel for what the days are like.  I still have this picture of kids running amok with no order whatsoever and the parents going nuts, but that&#39;s so different that what I&#39;m hearing.  I&#39;ve also read detailed emails about people&#39;s days, and I&#39;m still coming up short!  Is this part of my own deschooling process to feel so confused and unsure??  My heart says this is so aligned with everything I&#39;m really about underneath all my years of conditioning, but I don&#39;t really know what to do next.  I want someone on my shoulder to tell me!!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I want to know about how other unschoolers get their 3 year old wired up tired kids to go to bed, I want to know what mealtimes look like, I want to know how you get them to put their coats on, etc. when you have somewhere you have to be, I just feel so out of my element and like letting it all flow is a little scary and I feel powerless and out of control in my own house letting the girls decide so much for themselves.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Please help! :o)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thank you from my heart,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n  Mom to Jade & Skye (3) just wanting to get it right!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          Hi, Laura! <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you feel good about your changes - you are making such important <br/>\nstrides forward.

My name is Laura. I have two children, a six year-old<br/>\n  daughter and a four year-old son. We are new to unschooling, and new<br/>\n  to the formal concept of gentle parenting. We were very AP when the<br/>\n  kids were small. We co-slept, nursed on demand, I wore the babies in<br/>\n  slings and Baby Bjorns...then I seemed to lose patience with them as<br/>\n  they got older. I had no idea how to handle their emerging<br/>\n  personalities, and most of the advice I received involved control,<br/>\n  punishment and rewards. We started spanking for practically every<br/>\n  little &quot;offense&quot;, and I was very controlling with them. Our<br/>\n  relationship was (understandably) very strained for over a year, with<br/>\n  lots of whining, hurting and YELLING, unfortunately. I am not sure how<br/>\n  I went from such a gentle mama to an angry, scary mama, but I did.

I&#39;ve been thinking lately on why AP when they&#39;re small, that<br/>\nseems to come SO easily (at least it did for me), doesn&#39;t always<br/>\ntransition to gentle parenting/consensual living/radical unschooling<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re older. I&#39;m still mulling it over, it&#39;ll probably be a<br/>\nblog entry one day, but just last night I was thinking so much of it<br/>\nhas to do with who&#39;s around us, and the type of parenting support we<br/>\nreceive.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn! Saying that just gave me a HUGE rush of appreciation for those<br/>\nRU parents who were RU before the internet. I&#39;m guessing there were<br/>\nsome! lol I SO rely on groups like this to provide the safety net<br/>\naround me. I know there was Growing Without Schooling, and a whole<br/>\ncommunity around that magazine. It&#39;s hard for me to imagine what that<br/>\nwould have looked like. Anyone written about that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - I was definitely AP, but like you, began moving away from<br/>\nthat as my son aged. But -- reluctantly! I knew in my heart I wanted a<br/>\ndifferent way to parent, to be. But everyone in my support group here<br/>\n(mostly La Leche League parents) were &quot;moving on&quot;, putting their kids<br/>\nin preschool, handing out harsher and harsher consequences for<br/>\n&quot;misbehavior&quot;. I was still *mostly* a gentle parent, but if you think<br/>\nyou&#39;re supposed to be making your kid do something they don&#39;t want to<br/>\ndo, you&#39;re going to be mean, eventually. I *wanted* to follow Evan&#39;s<br/>\nlead, but *no one* around me was living that way, and I heard over and<br/>\nover how I&#39;d ruin his life if I didn&#39;t &quot;parent&quot; him differently. So I<br/>\nbegan mistrusting my gut.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell - never again! After 1st and 2nd grades at a charter school, we<br/>\nfound unschooling, which led to radical unschooling. I wonder if I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t had a computer at home, where we&#39;d be? No need to dwell there!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very touched by your e-mail.
