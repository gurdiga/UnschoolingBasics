Argh!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only just realized that Karl likes to have something to do or share<br/>\nor work through in order to be comfortable around other kids when he&#39;s<br/>\nfeeling awkward and new.  Sometimes in order to keep personal integrity<br/>\npeople get bristly in uncomfortable situations.  Karl is a take charge guy<br/>\nbut he&#39;s also learning a lot socially.  And having some physical object as a<br/>\nbridge to other kids gives him some experience with them to decide if<br/>\nthey&#39;re ok without directly committing himself.  We brought his play acting<br/>\nclothes and even though it wasn&#39;t a smooth transition, he was able to talk<br/>\nthrough with the objects and figure out something he could be the leader on<br/>\nand still end up playing with the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there are *reasons* that kids don&#39;t like each other sometimes and don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to play.  Karl had been hanging out with some kids for years (since he<br/>\nwas 3) and though they have left school and are at home all day now<br/>\nhomeschooling, they have a lot of schoolthink and Karl got questioned about<br/>\nhis reading skills and called a baby.  Had the unfriendly behavior of one of<br/>\nthe kids not been so outright I would never have known anything untoward was<br/>\ngoing on.  It was only after Karl got yelled at in the face &quot;YES&quot; so<br/>\naggressively that I realized something really wrong (and unexplained) was<br/>\ngoing on.  Days later, Karl was able to talk about reading and being told<br/>\nhe&#39;s a baby.  So I didn&#39;t know what was going on right then but he<br/>\neventually told me and then I understood some of the inexplicable undertones<br/>\nI had been noticing before the yelling.
