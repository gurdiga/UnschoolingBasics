I know she is concerned about how the children will go to<br/>\ncollege and &quot;complete&quot; their education.  I braced myself this week to be on<br/>\nthe defensive and actually found my mom asking some really &quot;I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nunderstand what you are doing&quot; type questions.  I want to help her have a<br/>\nbit more insight to why we love unschooling and why we are doing what we are<br/>\ndoing.  Rather than give her a book (which may be more than she has time for<br/>\nright now) I thought that I would make up a list of a few unschooling web<br/>\npages and articles that she could read a bit at a time and see various<br/>\naspects and viewpoints.  I also would like to point her to some direct pages<br/>\nfrom Sandra Dodd&#39;s website.  So, here is where you all come in.  Send me<br/>\n(either on the list or privately, doesn&#39;t matter) the url&#39;s to specific<br/>\narticles that you have found helpful in explaining unschooling and that gave<br/>\nyou a deeper understanding of how this really works.  I&#39;ve got a few in<br/>\nmind, but would like to give her about a dozen or so specific articles that<br/>\nfrom there she could branch out.  I think she has finally gotten it into her<br/>\nhead that nothing she offers (such as paid tuition at a private school) or<br/>\nsuggests (such as the really cool art program at such-n-such magnet school)<br/>\nwill sway me from doing what I am doing.  So now she wants to understand it<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16295,"nextTopicId":16013}}
