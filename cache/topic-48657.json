On Sunday, seemingly out of the blue, my son (11) said he wanted to build a battle bot. Turns out, he&#39;d seen a video clip on the Internet from the old BattleBots TV show that ran in the US about 10 years ago. And that was all the inspiration he needed ... lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d bought my kids the older Lego Mindstorms kit, with the yellow RCX brick (the current one is called NXT), off of CraigsList two or three years ago. Even though they wanted it and were excited to have it, they played with it for about two nights and then that was it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we brought that set out and my son has been playing with it every day since then. He actually saw a friend&#39;s NXT robot yesterday and initially thought he wanted that one instead. It&#39;s newer, can handle one more sensor, has a sound sensor, etc., but after really looking at it, he decided he likes his older kit better. The reason is that there is a lot more building that *has* to be done with the older kit. Even the simplest sample robot requires a fair amount of Lego building. The RCX kit really is a Lego kit, with a robotic brain and sensors added on. The NXT kit is more like a robotic brain and sensor kit, with a smallish number Lego Technics parts added on. My son likes the building part and thinks that the NXT kit doesn&#39;t allow you to do enough of that. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s true -- maybe you can extend things with your own Lego pieces -- but that&#39;s his perception.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s goal is still to build a battle bot, so last night we ordered two used how-to-build-a-battle-robot books on Amazon. Today he plans to contact his friends and ask them if they want to build a battle bot with him and maybe find a competition to enter. In the meantime, his short-term plan is to build all the robots in the Lego advanced builder&#39;s kit (that we got when I bought the Mindstorms set), so he will understand how to build components that do different things. The robot he built the other night &quot;walks&quot; on a wire. That was pretty cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if he will stay interested enough in any of this to actually be able to build a battle bot. It will be quite a project, and we have a steep learning curve ahead of us, that&#39;s for sure. But for now he&#39;s excited and happy and we&#39;ll take it from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I appreciate the original poster&#39;s question and all the replies. I&#39;m going to check out some of the resources people suggested. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nLori<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I should add that when I asked him how a particular gear assembly was working, he explained it to me and then added that he learned that info about gears from the PBS show Cyberchase. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tim from Oz&quot; &lt;tim@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you everyone for your great ideas and suggestions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you also Meredith for the reminder to take a step back and think about what I meant by &quot;playing with robots&quot;.

The microbots kits are along the same lines, although with more actual construction - better for kids who like electronics. These are things with a lot of &quot;educational&quot; appeal, but unless your kid already has a fascination for real world robotics, electronics, or programming, they&#39;re not worth throwing money at. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he want to fight with robots? Look into battle bots if so. Those are mostly cars and car-like robots, remote controlled, some using mindstorm components, some not. There are clubs and tournaments for that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wants to play with cute robot-ish things, I&#39;d look at K&#39;nex kits, which have some cars and bugs at very low prices. They won&#39;t appeal to a kid who likes real live robotics but the will appeal to a kid who likes robot movies and stories and games, but doesn&#39;t really care about teaching a block on wheels to run into walls and turn around.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":86487535,"authorName":"Renee Cooper","from":"Renee Cooper &lt;rmilller@...&gt;","profile":"reneem29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Ideas for robotics","postDate":"1340606764","msgId":48658,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE0Ny1kczE0Q0YyQzVBOTAyODkwRUIzNTJDQjFDOEUxMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpzOGlncyttZDczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpzOGlncyttZDczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48657,"nextInTopic":48659,"prevInTime":48657,"nextInTime":48659,"topicId":48657,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you taken a look at Motorized Mechanisms out at the LEGO educational site?
