My parents were hippies, but my name is <br/>\nactually my middle name roughly translated from a native Black Foot Indian <br/>\nlanguage. My dad&#39;s family has always called me by that, he is 1/4 Blackfoot. <br/>\nMy mothers family has never called me by that name, they call me Melissa, my <br/>\nmiddle name. I use both interchangeably. This year I got a letter from the <br/>\nDepartment of Defense saying I HAD to use my legal name on all documents, so <br/>\nI am using WIldflower more these days. It also makes me easier to identify <br/>\non yahoo groups!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;have you<br/>\n&gt;read &quot;Unplug the Christmas Machine&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your the second person to recommend that book.
