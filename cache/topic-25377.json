But<br/>\none  thought came to me -- could your oldest be using drugs?  Her<br/>\nbehavior  has some definite hallmarks of drug users (I have a brother<br/>\nwho used, so  they are familiar) or of mental illness.  (And the line<br/>\ncan be blurry  sometimes, btw.)  <br/>\n_______________________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, I too thought of that, but she passed the 2 drug tests she had to take  <br/>\nfor 2 jobs she landed. Its def. about her boyfriend. She did anything and  <br/>\neverything to come to his call, or to be available, no matter what. When she ran  <br/>\nout of money, she used my mom&#39;s credit card, took the money from Julian&#39;s <br/>\npiggy  bank, her sister&#39;s purse, my wedding gifts of cash...you get the idea. <br/>\nDrugs, in  some ways, would have been a clearer answer. But it&#39;s not that. I <br/>\nreally think  that her lack of self esteem has gotten her to do things she was/is <br/>\nnot ready  for yet, emotionally, and is now holding on for dear life to the <br/>\nboyfriend (who  sent me a few nasty text messages telling me I couldn&#39;t text her <br/>\nbecause he  &quot;owned her phone&quot; which made me want to scream, but I didn&#39;t. I <br/>\nignored him and  spoke to L about it directly). I&#39;m sure about her passing the <br/>\ndrug tests, as  they were sudden and she isn&#39;t savvy about that kind of thing, <br/>\nand I am more  so...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still not sure what to advise you to do, though -- but  perhaps<br/>\nidentifying the problem would be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought is  she might still be working through your divorce (or<br/>\nnot being together with  their father -- I don&#39;t know the details, and<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t matter; what  matters is what is going on in her mind.)  No<br/>\nfirst hand experience  with that.<br/>\nOh, yes. I think so too. She is very emotionally closed, hasn&#39;t said she  <br/>\nloves me in YEARS - easily since age 6. The divorce was VERY hard on her. She  <br/>\nclaims too that she has &quot;hated&quot; her sister Grace since she was born, if not  <br/>\nbeforehand. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne things stands out - one day, their dad was supposed to come get them.  <br/>\nThey packed, they waited by the window to watch for his car. He was late, never  <br/>\ncalled...she and James stood there for HOURS waiting for him. He called <br/>\nlater,  saying he was still in Laughlin, he overslept...and he wouldn&#39;t be coming. <br/>\nI do  think her anger at her Dad is given to me. I&#39;m WAY safer to be angry at <br/>\nthan her  Dad is...I think she trusts me to hate me, if that makes sense...but <br/>\nshe feels  she has to hold on to dear life with her father, but he might <br/>\ndisappear in one  form or another...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are right not to continue enabling her -- she will  definitely be<br/>\nresentful right now, and not see why you did what you  did.  Hopefully,<br/>\ndown the road, she will look back at it  differently.  The stealing,<br/>\nbtw, combined with being unable to hold a  job (though that could have<br/>\nmultiple causes) is what made me think  addiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could be more helpful, but send all my best for you  in<br/>\ndealing with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And for your other teens -- well, I have a  very cool teen who is<br/>\npartially homeschooled, partially charter  schooled.  He loves not<br/>\nbeing a traditional  student!)<br/>\nAren&#39;t they great? lol! I just am so prod of them, for so many reasons..am  <br/>\nof Laura too, but the situation is obviously different right now. I&#39;m glad to  <br/>\nhear of your son&#39;s happiness with himself. That&#39;s a goal we all should have -  <br/>\ntoo bad it&#39;s so hard for some of us. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you so much for your post. It was one of the hardest things in my  life <br/>\nto do, kick her out. I question it all the time. But I just didn&#39;t know  what <br/>\nto do anymore...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25373,"nextTopicId":25322}}
