And that all of this takes time<br/>\nAND patience w/ yourself.   And also a refusal to give up and not move<br/>\nforward, even if the progress is seemingly *slow*.  Even the awareness takes<br/>\ntime!  Getting to the stopping and taking deep breaths, for me at least, has<br/>\ntaken many unintentional blow-ups, and the guilt that comes afterwards to<br/>\neven be able to stop BEFORE, and breathe.  But I&#39;m getting there.  I<br/>\nunderstand the tape playing over and over in your head (which always come w/<br/>\nthe guilt for me) and I got some sage advice about that: The only way to get<br/>\nthose tapes to stop playing, to stop beating yourself up and going around in<br/>\nthat never ending wrestling match, is to *forgive* yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 6-9 mos. ago I was filled w/ feelings of resentment a lot and while I<br/>\nKNOW I&#39;d had them before, it was the point that I really started to want to<br/>\ndo something about it.  I had already realized that when I feel that way re:<br/>\nmy kids it&#39;s usually because they are wanting their needs met, and I am<br/>\nwanting my needs met and their needs are pushing on my<br/>\nunmet-needs-as-a-child &quot;button&quot;.  I revert to about 6 years old and am<br/>\npouting and grumping for not getting my way (you know the stance, complete<br/>\nw/ arms folded!  --I&#39;m not saying I literally looked like this, but I FELT<br/>\nit!).  It&#39;s a shame for me that I didn&#39;t get my needs met as a child, but<br/>\nit&#39;s also not my time to be a child anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nYES, as Joyce goes on to say, we must find ways to meet our needs too (and<br/>\nshe gave you some wonderful examples of how to do that), but not in that<br/>\nmoment when my child is struggling to get hers met.  *I* need to do my best<br/>\nto understand what she&#39;s feeling and acknowledge it and offer solutions or<br/>\nhugs or just her mom quietly listening to her, whatever SHE needs at that<br/>\nmoment (and if I&#39;m really struggling in that moment, I try my best to just<br/>\nsay nothing and let her screaming, crying, whining, etc. wash over me<br/>\n--until I&#39;m better able to speak to her w/ love and not resentment).  Or<br/>\nelse I&#39;m just going to continue the chain and she will end up like me,<br/>\nresenting her children.  I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s so important to take the<br/>\nopportunity, when you can, to nourish yourself (literally and figuratively)<br/>\nin order to be able to nourish her.  Just like in order to be able to nurse<br/>\na child, you have to eat and drink or the other visual/analogy I&#39;ve been<br/>\nrelating to lately, about taking the oxygen mask first on a airplane so that<br/>\nyou can then be able to give your child the oxygen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was in the midst of really trying to understand the resentment thing<br/>\nlast spring, I went on a retreat and after a meditation session, they gave<br/>\nus each a quote and said to just pick one w/o looking at it and it is the<br/>\none that was meant for you at this moment (which I find to be true a lot<br/>\n---what I need...if I voice it....comes to me).  So this is what I got (I<br/>\nfound it to be pretty powerful, and a bit like a knife through the heart<br/>\n...and a wake up call).<br/>\n �Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.�<br/>\n<br/>\n Malachy McCourt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkexist.com/quotes/malachy_mccourt/\">http://thinkexist.com/quotes/malachy_mccourt/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Suggestions for how to place boundaries/ limits?","postDate":"1257593570","msgId":42026,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZBMkVCNEQzLUIwMzgtNEQ3Qy05OTJGLTQzNzc3RTJBOUIwQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhkMXNhcys2Nmp0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhkMXNhcys2Nmp0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42024,"nextInTopic":42029,"prevInTime":42025,"nextInTime":42027,"topicId":42001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It takes time and repetition to change years and years of habits. Its part of your own &quot;deschooling&quot; process. Ultimately, deschooling isn&#39;t just getting school out of your head, but all the messages and habits that get in the way of having a better relationship with your kids. Some aspects of &quot;deschooling&quot; can go on for years, depending on your past. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal isn&#39;t to get perfect, its to have a Better relationship with your kids and your self than otherwise. No one is perfect, no matter how long she&#39;s been unschooling. Its all a process. You can see that you need to make some changes - that&#39;s Fantastic! That&#39;s success, right there! Many many many parents never ever get that far, they just go on parenting on their &quot;default&quot; setting. Knowing you don&#39;t want to do that, and actively looking to change? That&#39;s a miracle. Congratulations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo now you work on it. You don&#39;t have to change everything all at once - in fact, its not helpful to try to change everything all at once. Its overwhelming to you and the rest of your family. But you can change the Next thing that comes up, the next interaction. You can stop (even mid-yell), take a deep breath (even if you &quot;should&quot; have done it five minutes sooner), and find one more option, choose to go in a different direction. It doesn&#39;t have to be the best possible direction. At first, you may find you can&#39;t come up with very many ideas and options in the moment. That&#39;s something else that takes practice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;For example, I personally need a lot of down time, but my daughter seems to need personal reassurance and connectedness ALL THE TIME. and there are 4 of them... someone always needs something.

Feelings of resentment are totally","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1942676758\">As I am now tandem nursing for the second time, I am very familiar with feelings of resentment for the older nursling. Feelings of resentment are totally normal and expected among tandem mamas. I&#39;m currently nursing my 4-year old and my 6-month old. And yes, I *still* go through periods of resentment occasionally toward my 4-year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that has helped me, when I go through these hard periods, is changing my expectations. Initially, it might seen crazy to expect that an older nursling could go from nursing 3 times per day to 10 times per day. But in reality, it is very normal. The key is remember that it won&#39;t be forever. I know - these are hard thoughts to get your mind around. Your mind may be screaming inside that your older nursling shouldn&#39;t need to nursing that often! But in reality, she might just need it temporarily. It may help to remind yourself that your 3 year year old is still a baby. She may not look so tiny as your newborn, which is why we have to remind ourselves sometimes how very young 3 years old is. Tandem nursing is a whole different ballgame than singleton nursing. You have to have the expectation, especially during the first month or two, that you will literally be doing *nothing* but nursing, sleeping, eating (yourself), and maybe a shower every few days. If you sort of remind yourself that your important job is nursing almost constantly, it may make things easier to handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not to say that you can&#39;t try setting some limits when you are going absolutely batty. You can try setting some limits and see what happens. On practical matters, you may need to set some limits so that you know your newborn is getting the breast milk he needs. But on the other hand, at only 2 weeks postpartum, setting limits with your 3-year-old may backfire. Sometimes setting limits may make that older nursling, still adjusting to the birth, be even more clingy and whining. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to try to totally let go. You may have to do some serious spiritual/psychological work within yourself to make that happen. Whatever works for you, whether it&#39;s mediatation while nursing, some kind of zen-like trance, or just focusing your mind on something else. When I was going through a similar struggle with tandem nursing my oldest and middle child, I met an unschooler who recommended something very helpful: focusing on one of my body parts while nursing. Like your hand or foot or something. You can look at the part and notice all the details - wrinkles, form, shadows, how that part feels, etc. This change is your shift of focus is similar to some kinds of childbirth coping strategies. In fact, if you look up coping strategies in &quot;Birthing From Within&quot;, you will find that some of those strategies are excellent for tandem nursing, when you are sitting there being irritated that your older nursing is asking to nurse for the millionth time that day. However you can get through all that nursing with a smile on your face, do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t already read &quot;Adventures in Tandem Nursing&quot;, I highly recommend getting it right away. Reading through it again has always helped me a lot when we are going through struggles. This is a blog that I wrote about tandem nursing that may also help a little: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tinygrass.com/2009/04/tandem-nursing-how-to-do-it-without-driving-yourself-and-your-nurslings-crazy/\">http://www.tinygrass.com/2009/04/tandem-nursing-how-to-do-it-without-driving-yourself-and-your-nurslings-crazy/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTrish<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;amandabpearl&quot; &lt;amanda@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We try to live an RU lifestyle, but I&#39;m really at a loss as to how to deal with my 3 year old right now.

Tandem nursing is definately a challenge. My children are 20 1/2 months apart and my son totally went off solids for a week or so and then slowly added them back in. Your newborn milk tastes really great and is full of healthy fat so a toddler can live on it. One thing to think of is during pregnancy your milk was likely not too plentiful so it could just be your toddler is excited to have milk back and likely needs reassurance your love is still there for them. My children are 3 1/2 and almost 2 now and they both still nurse quite a bit. There are plenty of times that I get frustrated with this but I just remind myself that this is just a small time in their lives and I want to look back and remember that I did what they needed. Of course, coming up with some coping methods helps because if you are unhappy then it&#39;s not working for anyone. I tried many things at different times and just judged to see how my toddler could handle it, I wasn&#39;t afraid to change my mind if he really needed to nurse when I asked him to wait. There are times that I will say, yes we can nurse but just for one minute, sometimes he&#39;ll ask for 2 or 3 but then he&#39;ll be content with a short nursing session. Sometimes when I am really done I&#39;ll just start counting down from 10 or from 5 and he&#39;ll often release the nipple even before I&#39;m done counting. I tend to nurse him a lot even in public but there are places I am uncomfortable doing it so I try to let him know in advance we won&#39;t nurse here and if I can an estimate of time that we will be there. Also he knows I will not nurse them both at the same time in public (I do have my limits). You said your toddler wants to nurse for half hour intervals and that sounds like a lot to handle. I can&#39;t remember if my toddler nursed for that long after his sister came along at the beginning or not but I know for quite a while anyway he&#39;s content with just a few minutes, even if his sister nurses longer. Perhaps you can try to see what your toddler is really after and see if you can meet that need. She might respond better if she got you all to herself for her nursing session, you could say five minutes or count to twenty or set a timer and just dote on her while she nurses and see if you can fill her cup faster? You said she isn&#39;t interested in one-on-one time so I think she might be trying to find her place in the new family and perhaps helping you take care of the baby would help. Playing peek-a-boo, singing to him, babies can sometimes respond so much to an older sister. Also, getting diapers, *holding* the baby, etc. I wish you much success and I hope you really enjoy this time, it is fleeting. How wonderful that you are willing and able to continue to meet their needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon Bliss<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Krisula Moyer &lt;krisula@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trayton and Sydney are 24 months apart.

We had a home birth and I stayed in bed for the whole first week just nursing, cuddling, listening to music, videotaping, and reading stories as a family. My 3 y/o virtually stopped eating solid foods and nursed most of that week along side her baby brother. She may have nursed even more than him and I was so surprised that she actually gained weight. I enjoyed that time with the two of them. I saw it as a special way for them to bond. As they got older they would hold hands while they nursed, look in each others eyes, and giggle. My friends called me a breastfeeding goddess. I too found it most comfortable to be in a recliner chair which we moved into the bedroom.<br/>\nIs there some message you are giving yourself, or your dtr, that she shouldn&#39;t be acting this way? When I get into the &quot;shouldn&#39;ts&quot; I create stress for myself by resisting what is. <br/>\nMy dtr also enjoyed helping me out with the baby. She helped to put the socks on and she loved having little tasks like getting diapers and things for the baby. The three of us would also take baths together.<br/>\nIs there a way you could include her in helping with the baby? Include her in burping the baby. Show her how to do it. Maybe say, &quot;I have to burp the baby. Do you want to help me?&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s time to change the baby&#39;s diaper.

With my oldest two, I<br/>\nwould nurse them at the same time. My oldest was 3 so I would let her attach<br/>\nand lay across my lap. Then I would lay the baby kind of on top of her legs<br/>\nand let her attach. It worked best in my recliner where I could recline a<br/>\nlittle and have them overlap some. That worked great because my oldest would<br/>\nhold the baby&#39;s hand while they nursed together. When my oldest no longer<br/>\nsaw herself in competition with the baby, it made things a lot easier and<br/>\nshe was a lot less demanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, some kids are not happy to nurse at the same time. Right<br/>\nnow, I have a 2.5 year old and a 10 month old. That has been very<br/>\nchallenging because my 2.5 year old wants to nurse more than the baby and<br/>\nwants more of my attention than anyone else and she will get mad if any of<br/>\nher sisters try to get my attention. She doesn&#39;t even want to share me with<br/>\nher big sisters. I cannot nurse the two of them together because my 2.5 year<br/>\nold is too wiggly and will kick or pinch the little one. I have to nurse<br/>\nthem separately because it is too painful to nurse them at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m becoming resentful towards her, which definitely is not helping<br/>\n </span></blockquote>things...

When I can no<br/>\nlonger tolerate my 2.5 year old nursing, I will ask her to stop but I will<br/>\ntell her she can hold it or use it as a pillow. I cuddle her really close<br/>\nand try to give her that one on one nuzzling without the nursing element.<br/>\nAnother suggestion is to set up an area where you can relax and tend to the<br/>\nbaby while still playing with your older daughter. I had an area set up in<br/>\nmy bedroom and an area set up in the living room. I had all of the baby<br/>\nstuff I needed plus toys and movies that I could put on and watch with the<br/>\nolder ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to do to help cut down on the nursing is to give your daughter<br/>\nattention without her asking. If she is walking around or doing something<br/>\nwhile the baby is settled, go scoop her up and shower her with affection.<br/>\nTry to fill her up with attention before she resorts to nursing. She needs<br/>\nthat closeness. She needs to feel like the baby is not shoving her out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to consider is giving your 3 yearl old jobs to do. With my<br/>\noldest, we built her up by telling her that she could help us and would be<br/>\nour helpers. She is the kind of kid that likes to be a part of things and<br/>\nloved to get stuff for me and the baby. She would help give the baby baths<br/>\nand change her diaper. I set things up so that she could even help me and<br/>\nget me bottles of water or other small things. With my other daughter, that<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work at all because she had a completely different personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy second daughter just needed a lot of extra snuggling when the baby was<br/>\nborn. If I was laying down with the baby, she was right there next to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually try to figure out whether she is doing it because she is hungry or<br/>\nif she is doing it to reconnect with me. Make sure that she has lots of<br/>\nsnacks that are readily available. I have noticed that sometimes my daughter<br/>\nwill ask to nurse rather than tell me she is hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to give concrete advice because it really depends on the<br/>\npersonality of your oldest. The main thing to do is to not push her aside<br/>\nand make her feel like she has been replaced by the baby. I suspect the<br/>\nnursing will decrease once she feels her needs are being met. Whenever I<br/>\nfind myself resenting my 2.5 year old, I try to think about how she is<br/>\nfeeling. Also, I have had my husband or my mom take her out so that I can<br/>\nrecharge and be able to better meet her needs. Having a daddy daughter date<br/>\n(or a grandma date) works wonders with the older kids and it gives me time<br/>\nto recharge.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Suggestions for how to place boundaries/ limits?","postDate":"1257286543","msgId":42002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4Njk2MkNGLThDMkMtNEVBQS04RTA0LUU4NDU0RkJBRDRBNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjcTdqZitmdWU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhjcTdqZitmdWU2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42001,"nextInTopic":42003,"prevInTime":42001,"nextInTime":42003,"topicId":42001,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve just had a new baby (2 weeks ago) and she&#39;s been great with him, but really sensitive and whiny in general. She does not want to do activities one-on-one with either my husband or myself, and seems to really need to spend time as a family unit. She&#39;s also happy to spend one-on-one time with my mother, and has happily spent the night there 2 times as well (she usually spends one night a week with her grandparents). <br/>\nI know part of her behavior is just adjusting to probably the biggest event of her life to date, but she&#39;s also demanding to nurse what feels like all of the time...definitely more than the new baby. Before he was born she nursed 0-3 times a day....which was fine. Now she wants to nurse what feels like constantly....maybe 8-10 times a day, for 20-30 minutes at a stretch. I tried to say yes each time she asked, and let her know that she could nurse, just for a short time...so she asked about every 5-15 minutes! <br/>\nWhen I do tell her that she needs to wait until I &quot;finish burping the baby&quot; until &quot;the TV show is over&quot;  or some other time frame that is tangible to her there is a total melt down. I&#39;m becoming resentful towards her, which definitely is not helping things... I know this is a phase for her, but I need to figure out a coping strategy for myself for the next couple of weeks, or figure out a way to limit the nursing to a level that works for both of us. Any suggestions are really appreciated!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5302,"nextTopicId":42028}}
