Think about that.  <br/>\nWhat harm does it do if someone doesn&#39;t like you or doesn&#39;t like what  <br/>\nyou do? Close your eyes and really think about that fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re to be true to ourselves, it&#39;s often going to make other  <br/>\nuncomfortable. That doesn&#39;t mean being rude is okay. We don&#39;t have a  <br/>\nright to force others to make accommodations for us, or deliberately  <br/>\nmake them uncomfortable &quot;just because&quot;, but if we want to dye our  <br/>\nhair purple, or unschool, or turn our front yard into a meadow, or  <br/>\ndrive a Humvee and people think badly of us, then those bad thoughts  <br/>\nsay more about them than it does about us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do not have a babysitter as I raise my own children and feel that  <br/>\n&gt; I am supposed to take care of them not pawn them off to someone for  <br/>\n&gt; my own enjoyment I had them and  they are my responsibility....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can think of a handful of times Kathryn had a babysitter in the  <br/>\npast 15 years, and while unschoolers do emphasize that kids need to  <br/>\nbe top priority, that doesn&#39;t mean we should sacrifice ourselves for  <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe should model taking care of them *and* ourselves. We shouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nsteal their happiness to make ourselves happy -- if baby sitters make  <br/>\nthem unhappy, we should find another way to have an evening alone  <br/>\nwith our husbands -- but we shouldn&#39;t always be setting aside our own  <br/>\nneeds and wants and desires to tend to them. We should find ways to  <br/>\nmeet everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe should model the lives we would want them to lead.

You want your children to feel you love  <br/>\nthem equally. But treating them equally isn&#39;t the same thing as being  <br/>\nequal. Your children are individuals and have individual needs. We  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t make *false* accommodations. I agree. You shouldn&#39;t give  <br/>\nyour son more attention to *compensate* for his difficulties, but he  <br/>\n*does* have different needs and wants and desires.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome children enjoy doing things with someone and they&#39;ll need more  <br/>\nindividual attention than children who like to do things on their  <br/>\nown. Some children enjoy staying at home and some enjoy going out,  <br/>\ndoing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeding them the same food shouldn&#39;t be the goal.

I&#39;m not asking that in a sarcastic way. I&#39;m not saying  <br/>\nyou&#39;re bad for thinking that. I&#39;m asking you to think about it. Why  <br/>\ndo you feel being so important in your children&#39;s lives so special?  <br/>\nWhy do you need to hold onto that role? Really really think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve mentioned several things you do that relate to responsibility.  <br/>\nThat might be something you want to examine also. Your need to be and  <br/>\nfeel responsible may be feeding some lack in you. You may be using  <br/>\nyour role as teacher and your children&#39;s roles as dependent on your  <br/>\ndoing everything right to feed a lack from your own childhood. Your  <br/>\nfear of people looking at what you&#39;re doing and &quot;judging&quot; you may  <br/>\npoint to some hurt in you that you&#39;re trying to compensate for  <br/>\nthrough dedicating and sacrificing yourself for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see what children learn in terms of teaching and being taught,  <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to miss the more important act of them learning and  <br/>\nfiguring things out on their own by living.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools teach.

They learned by watching us go, and trying it out. They  <br/>\nlearned by wetting themselves and by falling in the toilet, by peeing  <br/>\non the floor, by feeling that sticki-ickness when they don&#39;t wipe  <br/>\nwell enough. They learned by knowing that they could trust me enough  <br/>\nto ask for help without me yelling about a wet floor, or a dirty  <br/>\ntoilet seat, or a stinky backside. I haven&#39;t taught any of them to  <br/>\nread, they learned while I was reading to them (the same way dh and I  <br/>\nboth learned to read).
