Almost all they sell are really beautiful and delicious cupcakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD&#39;s comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Wow, they were really having fun.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Who?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The cupcakers. What a fun job!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, DD&#39;s not the gamer in the family and DD&#39;s not learning to be a baker but what she was focusing on was the fun these two people were having running their little shop. Baking and chatting and making the previously dingy sub shop a pretty place, etc. We all know there&#39;s a lot of business knowledge behind all the pretty but there was also a lot of joy just bubbling out of these people.<br/>\n<br/>\nDD doesn&#39;t need to be forced to take a baking class or told not to join her brother for the gaming she does do to know that that&#39;s how she&#39;d like to be when she has a job some day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t control how the kids learn these things. We can&#39;t guide or drive them onto a career path we want -- we could try but they can skip off the path pretty darned easily. We can&#39;t control, in the end. That&#39;s important -- and freeing -- to remember. We can provide (time, lots of time, opportunities to explore), encourage, set examples, etc. But we can&#39;t control the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best kind of living and learning and making<br/>\nan income is through play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28313,"nextTopicId":28330}}
