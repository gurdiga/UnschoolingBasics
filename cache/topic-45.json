We stay on the base nearly all the time.  Dh <br/>\nis &quot;in the know&quot; as far as terrorism and threats to the base, etc., <br/>\nso he&#39;s not always comfortable going out and about.  Besides, it&#39;s <br/>\nscary driving into the city here!  Adana is quite a big city, and <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t believe how people drive over here - totally crazy!  <br/>\nIt&#39;s very stinky too.  There is often a smell of burning <br/>\nrubber/plastic/something in the air.  I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>\nrecycles.  We&#39;ve been on a couple of little trips, but it&#39;s not easy <br/>\ntravelling here, especially with 2 girls who are very squeamish <br/>\nabout strange bathrooms (4yo lets me know when I need to clean the <br/>\ntoilet!)  You never know what the bathrooms will be like.  Also, gas <br/>\nis extremely expensive too.  It is about $2 on base right now and <br/>\nprobably double that off base.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main thing we don&#39;t like though, is that we haven&#39;t found any <br/>\nfriends.  The base is small.  There is a youth center that we tried <br/>\na couple of times, but the kids who go there are all about sports.  <br/>\nDarcy (9yo) is SO not into sports.  She loves computers and books <br/>\nand anime and animals.  We just don&#39;t seem to meet anyone that we <br/>\nclick with.  I&#39;ve never been a good friend-maker either.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>\nshy really.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have good days though.  Brenna (4yo) is really into horses, <br/>\nand there is a small stable here.  We go and ride occasionally, and <br/>\nwe go for walks a lot.  We catch ladybugs, butterflies, spiders, and <br/>\nsnails - lots of snails here!  We had a crab in our backyard last <br/>\nweek, no idea where that came from.  We play on the computer a lot <br/>\nand watch a lot of movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe REALLY wish we could go to the conference!  We may be coming to <br/>\nthe states this summer because my BIL is having a trial, but we <br/>\ndon&#39;t know when it is yet.  If at all possible, we&#39;ll make it to <br/>\nBoston.  Who knows where we&#39;ll move next year - hopefully close to <br/>\nsome unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to know anything specific about Turkey, just ask!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6,"nextTopicId":43}}
