I like it sooo<br/>\nmuch better than Girl Scouts but if you don&#39;t want a Christian group, then<br/>\nits not for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like more info, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEach badge that you earn, you learn sooo much about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, so far, my daughter has earned her cake decorating badge and<br/>\nher group is working on Personal Hygiene badge. She is also doing the<br/>\nscrapbook one on her own. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNikki<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30899,"nextTopicId":30947}}
