Ray&#39;s very different from me, he likes things that challenge my comfort zones on a regular basis. At first I resented that a little - why couldn&#39;t he like trees or rock-n-roll? Why did he have to like skateboarding and fire-spinning and death metal? But its important to me to have as good a relationship as possible with him, so I stretched a little. I did some research into the sorts of things he likes so that I could understand him when he talked about them and ask meaningful questions. I&#39;d watch him skate and spin fire, try out a few tricks myself, do more research. <br/>\n<br/>\nI checked in with friends who like various kinds of metal music and found types I could listen to (I can&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; a lot of metal... something in my hearing or processing turns it all to white noise) and when Ray found out I was doing that, He did some research and found music we both liked - he was eager to share his world with me. He found classical ensembles who do covers of popular metal artists and different varieties of metal neither of us had ever heard of (Epic Folk Metal, who knew?). <br/>\n<br/>\nIts common to think of parenting and homeschooling in terms of parents bringing the world to children, and children to the world, but so very often its my kids who bring the world to me. They expand my world and my mind when I least expect it. That used to intimidate me, but now I can see it as one of the marvels of my life - my kids are so marvelous!

Identify them? Catch them? Even if she&#39;s willing to learn those things it would be a good, handy resource for your dd, a mentor. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a place with poisonous snakes, so I can totally relate to your concern and caution, at the same time, I&#39;m not afraid of snakes and neither is my partner or my dd (my stepson is, though). Not being afraid is an important part of approaching and handling snakes safely! Fear isn&#39;t the same as &quot;healthy respect&quot; - the body language of fear will communicate itself to a wild animal, like a snake, and make it more nervous, too. Nervous snakes bite! Mellow snakes don&#39;t bite. So see your dds lack of fear as an asset in that regard. <br/>\n<br/>\nHelp her find resources. If your sister isn&#39;t interested in facilitating your dd&#39;s exploration, check with area zoos and science centers and see if there are any classes or workshops where she can handle snakes. Call some pet stores, too, while you&#39;re at it. Find you dd people who can help her know how to be safe with snakes. At the same time, get books and movies about snakes - do you have a field guide? Very handy. A book on pet-care for snakes would also be a good buy, even if you don&#39;t plan to get one as a pet. Lots of good info, there. Think of this as helping her do some research - an investment in her safety. The more she knows, the less likely she is to do something foolish, like try to grab a snake by the tail. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo y&#39;all have garter snakes or grass snakes in your area? I forget where you live, sorry! If so, and you can bear it at all, you can challenge her to catch those and bring them to you to show off. Those are good starter snakes! They will bite if you grab them the wrong way, but they aren&#39;t venomous and don&#39;t look like anything venomous, so they make good, safe practice. If you can&#39;t - can your sister? Again solicit her help or that of a friend as much as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] snakes?","postDate":"1274375546","msgId":44251,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4Mzc5Mi41NDMzOC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDMzODgzNy4xMzIyMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMzODgzNy4xMzIyMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44248,"nextInTopic":44252,"prevInTime":44250,"nextInTime":44252,"topicId":44216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Snakes have bones, they have cool skeletons, all spinal looking.

I can spend ages fascinated by snakes. I&#39;ve had rattlesnakes within striking distance of me, I&#39;ve held a fair number of garter snakes as well as constrictors of many types. When we were in Belize an herpetologist reached behind where Simon and I were sitting and pulled out a parrot snake who was in a bush behind us, we were in no danger before we were made aware of the snake and continued to be in no danger as we stroked his amazing skin. <br/>\n<br/>\nReally explore snakes, they aren&#39;t that scary and are very rarely dangerous. Most will run long before you come on the scene. I&#39;ve been around snakes all of my life and I think I&#39;ve only been bitten once, by a garter snake, even though they used to breed in the bushes next to my house. How awful it would be for you to share your fear with your daughter.

My 11 year old finds snakes fascinating.  She is amazed that something with no bones can move in such ways.  Always before I ve told her to stay away from them.  She knows we have poisonous snakes here.  I do let my sister take her in the snake house at the zoo and wildlife refuge.  I would prefer she give even caged snakes a wide birth.  However I can considering let her explore her interest in more depth if she wants.  The thing is question says she isn t afraid of them.  Fine but she should have a healthy respect for them.  I tried explcining it to her by telling her I m not afraid of cars but I know they could kill me so I m not going to go out in get in front of a moving vehicle.  I explained snakes are the same way.  Some can kill you most can bite.  You dont have to be afraid of them but you should be cautious and stay well away from one unless you<br/>\nknow for certain it isn t poisonous.   Here s my delema how do I let her explore her interest and still stay comfortable with it myself.  Seeing her hand go to the glass in front of a snakes head makes me want to pull her away from the cage.  I know it can t hurt her but I just prefer she stay far away from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

This kid has expressed an interest in something and her mother let her<br/>\nown agenda take precedence over what her kid wants.  And that agenda is full<br/>\nof lies and misinformation which is caused by the panic.  Do snakes bite?<br/>\nSure.  Does it hurt?  You betcha.  Deadly?  Sometime.  But you know what?<br/>\nMore kids are killed on trampolines than by snakes each day.  The leading<br/>\nkiller of children in the US is THEIR PARENTS.  Think about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) It&#39;s important to realize as has been said at this point, this mother<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to move her thinking forward, just find someone to help the kid<br/>\ninvestigate her passion.  She shouldn&#39;t be putting fear and misinformation<br/>\nin front of her kid so she can pass on the phobia.  It&#39;s not doing the kid<br/>\nany favors.  Snakes are NOT deadly killers those with phobias make them out<br/>\nto be.  They do a lot of good in the world, even the poisonous ones.  Bug<br/>\nand rodent control without any chemical residue being chief among them.<br/>\nTurning them into hunters of humans is just fear running wild.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.) ANY animal with a mouth can bite.  Including humans and human bites are<br/>\nthe most likely to get seriously infected.  So there is a lot of<br/>\nmisinformation here.  I didn&#39;t have time to word smith this yesterday nor<br/>\nthe patience today (I just had major surgery on Monday) so if it sounds<br/>\nharsh I apologize I&#39;m just trying to respond because I&#39;ve handled snakes for<br/>\ndecades a love them and I just hate to see this girl being thwarted by a<br/>\nmother&#39;s fear rather than the facts.  There are other people who can teach<br/>\nher about snakes safely and she can handle (and I recommend this) captive<br/>\nsnakes not wild ones which are more apt to carry salmonella.

We have already found five in our yard this year.  I let her study them but made her stay back a ways.  I insisted my other two look at them enough to know what they look like in case they find one.  Sure enough my then six year old found one just inches from her fingers when digging in the dirt.

 If she fell, did she get hurt?  Did she learn about the dangers of walking and the risks involved with walking?  YES!<br/>\nHave you or your child ever been burned at the stove or by hot water?  I bet you learned from that, too.  Does it mean you never touch water again because it might be hot enough to burn you?<br/>\nYou mention having a healthy respect for cars and snakes, but you don&#39;t talk about a healthy respect, you talk about fear and abject avoidance.  If this were occurring in my house, I&#39;d have two choices (maybe more)...learn about which snakes we have access to and whether they&#39;re poisonous and whether that poison is fatal OR trust that my child (having been raised to understand that there ARE dangers in life and we must learn to mitigate and navigate through life despite those dangers) will seek out that information FIRST before holding every available species.  I might even go the extra mile and strew some books, movies, websites regarding them.  I might, if I had fear, also take the opportunity to discuss Steve Irwin (did I get the name right?) and that he died doing what he loved AND knowing the dangers.  However, I can almost guarantee that there would be at least one conversation that goes something like:  &quot;I&#39;m curious about you and how you can<br/>\n be so fearless when I&#39;m terrified of snakes.  You are an amazing young woman and I learn more from you everyday.  I don&#39;t want to stop you from following your joy, but I AM scared when it comes to snakes.  Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll learn a bit of your bravery and you&#39;ll learn a bit of my caution and one day we can meet in the middle on this whole snake thing.  Until then, I&#39;m glad that you have (person X) to share it with.  I know you&#39;re growing up and that probably frightens me a little, too.  I love you.  Now why don&#39;t I make &quot;Snakes on a Plate&quot; (spaghetti) to celebrate your passion?&quot;<br/>\nTwo questions I keep asking myself when my kids illicit fear in me:1)  So what if they get hurt?  (Again, not that I want them abused, but getting hurt is NOT the end of the world and it&#39;s not always desirable to avoid it.)2)  If I don&#39;t let my children LIVE, then does it matter how safe they are?

You <br/>\nneglect to mention there&#39;s an average of 123 reported bites in the US <br/>\nalone every single day, with an average of 22 a day being poisonous.  <br/>\nAgain, this is US statistics only.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the fact is, they can be and are deadly killers.  There may only be <br/>\n5 or 6 deaths a year in the US, but those are people who didn&#39;t make it <br/>\nto the hospital in time or the victims were very young or elderly and <br/>\nsuffered more extensive damage from the toxins.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there&#39;s a place for snakes in the world, or else they would not be <br/>\nhere.  Is that place close to me?  Absolutely not!  If my children want <br/>\nto learn more about snakes, it&#39;s a subject my husband can help with, or <br/>\nthey may turn to the internet.  If Crystal is uncomfortable with the <br/>\nidea of snakes, why can&#39;t she just be uncomfortable without being beaten <br/>\nup over it?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents...<br/>\n<br/>\nSabrina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/19/2010 9:22 PM, Karen Swanay wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Try research.

See if there&#39;s a herpetology club in your area and go to meetings.  Go look at snakes in pet stores.   Talk with people who work with snakes.   Find as many opportunities for her to be around people who know snakes and for her to handle snakes safely.(safe for her and the snakes)   Help her get experience in a safe way, help her find knowledgeable people to visit with about snakes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems you&#39;d be more comfortable if she was afraid of all snakes because that will help you feel sure she&#39;ll be afraid of the venomous ones.   But fear is dangerous too.  Fear is more likely to make a person do something foolish.   Help her get good information and experience and she will develop the skills she needs to stay as safe as possible around venomous snakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to keep your fear in perspective.  There are few fatal snakebites per year in the US.  There are many fatal car accidents.  Your daughter probably rides in a car at least every week?

Maybe<br/>\nyou could participate by obtaining books and videos and web addresses for<br/>\nher. Let her delve in and really immerse herself in all of it. The more she<br/>\nlearns the more she will, undoubtedly, come to respect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso maybe she could speak with area naturalists. Just having someone to<br/>\ntalk with about local species, someone who could tell her about safety might<br/>\nhelp put your mind at ease. I believe that these things would mean more<br/>\ncoming from someone for whom snakes are an interest or a job function.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like my son, she&#39;ll learn a lot about ecosystems and food chains and<br/>\nlife in general.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, May 19, 2010 at 9:44 PM, crystal rid &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cryway2@...\">cryway2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I dont want to know anything about snakes and it was my daughter that said<br/>\n&gt; they dont have bones.

Some can kill you most can bite.  You dont have to be afraid of them but you should be cautious and stay well away from one unless you<br/>\n know for certain it isn t poisonous.   Here s my delema how do I let her explore her interest and still stay comfortable with it myself.  Seeing her hand go to the glass in front of a snakes head makes me want to pull her away from the cage.  I know it can t hurt her but I just prefer she stay far away from them.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44205,"nextTopicId":44041}}
