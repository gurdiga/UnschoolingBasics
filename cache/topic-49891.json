To find ideas that will work for you, keep reassessing where you want to go, what you want for your family, what person you want to be rather than heading for &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk yourself, &quot;Will that idea move toward or away from helping my child explore his interests?&quot; &quot;Will that idea move me toward or away from being a kinder person?&quot; Or whatever your priorities are.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make matters more confusing, people in daily social situations trade implementations, that is, &quot;What works for my family.&quot; Which makes sense. Not all families have the same goals or values. Not all families have the same mix of personalities. So no one can be certain what works for them will work for someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, even though an implementation may not work for every family, principles that are based on human nature rather than personality will work for anyone. Everyone likes to be treated kindly, respectfully, as though they and their thoughts were of value. (What a kind act looks like when implemented in a family is where the differences are.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that reason I prefer forums that focus on the goal I want and the principles I want to live by and *how* those principles work.

Despite some opposing points of view about side-issues and specific situations, there is pretty much a consensus that &quot;unschooling&quot; means letting go of &quot;school&quot; ideas about how children learn, and the notion that they must be forced to learn subjects chosen by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, although the mainstream K-12 schools in most of the world tend to: <br/>\nuse a set curriculum, <br/>\ndivide kids into grade levels by age, <br/>\nlist only 5 or 6 academic subjects as valuable enough to be a part of the &quot;core curriculum&quot;, <br/>\nuse certain types of textbooks and worksheets, etc, as teaching materials,<br/>\ngive mandatory assignments and tests,<br/>\nand grade the students&#39; work, <br/>\nthese &quot;school ideas&quot; and methods are NOT intrinsically necessary or beneficial to children. In fact, for the most part, they are very detrimental, both to children&#39;s learning, and to their well-being. I&#39;m pretty sure that all unschoolers agree that children do not have to be forced to learn or told what, when, and how to learn; each child (each human being, in fact) has the innate intelligence and the inherent right to make those decisions for him/herself. And there is an assumption among unschoolers (and the founders of the Sudbury Valley School and the other Sudbury schools) that children WANT to become functional adults, and they will choose to do what they can to accomplish this goal, in their own time and way.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: philosophical question on equality of ideas and learningto","postDate":"1374688563","msgId":49893,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtzcDRmait0NWRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtzcDAzOStrZGs4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49891,"nextInTopic":49894,"prevInTime":49892,"nextInTime":49894,"topicId":49891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** Not all sources will meet the same sorts of interests and needs.

It won&#39;t provide what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to dig down into the fundamental principles underlying unschooling and analyze your own thoughts and actions in light of those principles, then it&#39;s a good resource. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a big wide range of what people consider &quot;unschooling&quot; - a great deal of which doesn&#39;t have much to do with those fundamental principles, and there are plenty of resources which don&#39;t really say much about unschooling itself. And just like any other fad, there are people trying to capitalize on &quot;the unschooling market&quot; who aren&#39;t all that credible or honest, or trustworthy.

In fact, that lack of equality is part of the field in which learning occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s true of adult learning, too, with one big caveat: adults need a Lot more deschooling than kids. Adults start out learning about unschooling by asking very schoolish questions and expecting schoolish answers - it&#39;s inevitable, but it also sets adults up to sometimes narrow down their field of learning sooner than would a kid pursuing a similar interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo shop around! There&#39;s looooots of information about home and unschooling these days, and a great deal of it is free on the internet.
