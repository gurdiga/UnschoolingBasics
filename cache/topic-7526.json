","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1623736073\">&quot;I think it is offensive when people who are ignorant of what the &quot;label&quot;<br/>\nactually means to people and their families make a blanket statement<br/>\nsuch as<br/>\nthat. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that people who write about NOT liking labels like<br/>\ngifted, are ignorant of the issues these children face. Many of us<br/>\nhave out-of-synch or highly sensitive children that would have a<br/>\nheaping of labels put on them in school. We choose to live without<br/>\nthose labels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that ALL children are gifted is absolute truth.<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t saying that many, many children who fit the &quot;gifted&quot; label<br/>\naccording to the &quot;experts&quot; don&#39;t have huge challenges or sensitivies<br/>\nto deal with. By saying all children are gifted, it&#39;s saying ALL<br/>\nchildren are special and meant to shine in their own way (there&#39;s that<br/>\nword again).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do believe that searching out answers about your child is important,<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s hard to understand certain behaviors. It can be a HUGE<br/>\nrelief to parent&#39;s, knowing that their child is wired a certain way<br/>\nand seemingly bizarre behavior isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a huge relief to know that other parent&#39;s are dealing with<br/>\nthese challenges and to learn ways to meet your child&#39;s needs better.<br/>\nI understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean the label becomes a filter we see our child<br/>\nthrough. It doesn&#39;t mean the label defines anything other than a way<br/>\nto understand the child. Those kind of labels are harmful...that&#39;s all<br/>\nwe&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a unique child that challenges me to be a better person every<br/>\nday he is on this earth. He is Jalen...my sweet, intense, beautiful<br/>\nchild. He is not &quot;gifted&quot; or LD or ADD or ADHD or anything other than<br/>\nmy Jalen Kai.<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody is trying to say that a parent shouldn&#39;t do everything possible<br/>\nto understand their child&#39;s uniqueness. We aren&#39;t saying there aren&#39;t<br/>\nhugely challenging issues for some of these kids. The unschooling<br/>\nphilosphy stays the same though....it&#39;s all about helping each child<br/>\nexplore the world in their own way, assisting them where they need us,<br/>\nprotecting them, encouraging them and BEING with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7380,"nextTopicId":7529}}
