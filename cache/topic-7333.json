My son (9yo) has ALWAYS been resistant to running errands, <br/>\nwhether he was in school or now that we&#39;ve been homeschooling a few <br/>\nmonths. I find that sometimes it is just me that wants to get out of <br/>\nthe house or &quot;get something done&quot;, and usually it can wait til later <br/>\nin the day or the weekend when I can go myself. He is one of <br/>\nthose &quot;vocal&quot; kids, who lets me know what he wants and does not want, <br/>\nand I am glad for it. I always wondered how other people seemed to get <br/>\nthings done taking their kids with them, is it just me or my kid or <br/>\nwhat? So it&#39;s good to hear that not everyone&#39;s kids just &quot;go along&quot; <br/>\nwith the whole errand thing. And you know, if I don&#39;t force him, or <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s just now that he&#39;s older, he will work with me on going if <br/>\nit is something we &quot;have&quot; to do, like something with a time deadline <br/>\nor a doctor&#39;s appt for me or something. <br/>\nThanks for all the posts on this subject.<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7168,"nextTopicId":7382}}
