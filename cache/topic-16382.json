Since we started unschooling we have seen it less and less.  My<br/>\nson has difficulty expressing his needs or making them known in a<br/>\ntimely manner (as in by the time we finally figure it out it&#39;s too<br/>\nlate and he has exploded.)  The past year, though has been wonderful<br/>\nin comparison to previous years and every day we see more and more<br/>\nease in our relationship.  Not only because he is maturing, but also<br/>\nbecause he has learned to trust us.  That doesn&#39;t mean that there<br/>\nisn&#39;t the ocaissional outburst (that usually happens now more between<br/>\nsiblings) but that they have become fewer and have a much higher<br/>\n&quot;boiling point.&quot;  The biggest thing is gaining their trust and letting<br/>\nthem know that you are going to be their helper through this &quot;big bad<br/>\nworld&quot; rather than feed them to the wolves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is hard to look at adults who behaved &quot;poorly&quot; (read: were<br/>\nmisunderstood as children) and compare what their lives are like as we<br/>\nprobably have very few adults today who were homeschooled.  I know<br/>\nwhen I was going to school homeschooling was against the law where I<br/>\nlived.  So the few adults my age from around here that were<br/>\nhomeschooled were usually classically schooled (and parented) and<br/>\ndoing so under the radar.  We don&#39;t have generations of unschooled<br/>\nchildren to look at.  I think we are just starting to get into some<br/>\nsecond generations and even those are fairly few and far between.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224193221,"authorName":"Tonya Matthews","from":"&quot;Tonya Matthews&quot; &lt;godzilla.matthews@...&gt;","profile":"auburntonya","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:breakthrough kinda day","postDate":"1155154320","msgId":16419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGViZGZpZytiN29nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExNi1EQVY3N0U3QjY1QkFFM0JFNzY1MzRBNUZCOTU0MEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":16382,"nextInTopic":16422,"prevInTime":16418,"nextInTime":16420,"topicId":16382,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote ... of behavior.
