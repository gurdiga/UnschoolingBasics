If you feel like you need some &quot;alone<br/>\ntime&quot; then find a way to make that happen. Perhaps an early morning<br/>\nwalk around the neighborhood (which is a great remedy for stress to<br/>\nboot), or have a girlfriend come pick you up and go out for a lunch or<br/>\njust to have a cup of tea at her house.  Find out what your bus routes<br/>\nare and what kind of bus passes are available.  If the electric bill<br/>\nis overwhelming call the electric company before it becomes past due<br/>\nand see if they have an assistance program or can come do a home<br/>\ninspection to see how you can reduce (for not much money) your<br/>\nelectric waste (sealing doors and windows, using compact flourescent<br/>\nbulbs, changing the temperature on your hot water heater for maximum<br/>\nefficiency, what temperature to set your a/c on so that it runs less<br/>\nand you get cooling power better during that time, etc etc etc)  These<br/>\nare usually free and sometimes they even have specials that if you<br/>\npurchase the recommended things from them you get a deep discount<br/>\n(like caulking for windows and foam insulation around doors).<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210404204,"authorName":"wen3so","from":"&quot;wen3so&quot; &lt;wen3so@...&gt;","profile":"wen3so","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: i am confused!!!!!","postDate":"1152935001","msgId":15773,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5OW84cCttc2ZvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU5MmhjMCtjdGFlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15768,"nextInTopic":15775,"prevInTime":15772,"nextInTime":15774,"topicId":15659,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Others have responded so thoughtfully and with such calming perspective to the other areas of this post, so I only wanted to add: In response to:  there is so","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1446764209\">Others have responded so thoughtfully and with such calming perspective to the other <br/>\nareas of this post, so I only wanted to add:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to: &quot; there is so much out there on teaching a child to read.  i let my 5 <br/>\n year old pick his reading workbooks his choice to use workbooks not <br/>\n mine.  he wanted to have &quot;home work&quot; like the big kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried reading rods?
