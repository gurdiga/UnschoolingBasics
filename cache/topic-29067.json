He is now very happy and loving the <br/>\nunschooling &quot;routine&quot;.. LOL<br/>\nHe has tought himself to read and loves math. He is also very good <br/>\nwith other kids now,, as long as it is on his terms. <br/>\nHe was in the system for a while and he did great in pre-school then <br/>\nwhen K came about it was terrible. He came home with a black eye one <br/>\ntime and then with ring worm that was it for me. I pulled him out. He <br/>\nwas verbal at this point. He became verbal again at about 4yrs old. <br/>\nHe lost all language at 18mo. old. He has a comorbid diagnosis, <br/>\nautism with sensory integration, OCD and some anger issues possible <br/>\nbi-polar.   He has a younger bro. that is very demanding and they <br/>\nwork well together. He has been diagnosed with the onset of childhood <br/>\nbi-polar. <br/>\nUnschooling works for us for now. Who knows what tomorrow will bring <br/>\nbut our philosophy is one day at a time. I just do not think that the <br/>\nschool and ever give him what he needs and that is some creativity <br/>\nwith learning. <br/>\nWe did do some deschooling though for a while. I had to let him let <br/>\ngo of the schedule idea. He became to obsessed with it. So that took <br/>\nsome time. You just can not be so worried about what they are <br/>\nsupposed to know and just let them learn. Have fun with it let them <br/>\nlead the way with a bit of help. It may take some time to find out <br/>\nwhat makes him want to be engaged in learning but do not rush it or <br/>\nthey will back off even further.<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nKasey <br/>\nson to Morgan 8yrs old Autism <br/>\nand Asher 6 1/2 yrs old Childhood Bi-polar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Susan Wiltbank&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mommyswork2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Wow, it seems I have a lot of research to do in order to help her.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really appreciate all of this.

Homeschooling is not  <br/>\ncovered by IDEA.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be done, and as you say, some schools jump all over it because  <br/>\nit means that they can still get full funding for the child, while  <br/>\nnot having to pay for most services that would be required for a  <br/>\nseven hour day.  Many schools will let you take it to due process,  <br/>\nhowever, which is a long and time consuming. If you can show that  <br/>\nthey are not making progress at school, pull them out, provide  <br/>\nprivate therapy, you could go to due process for reimbursement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Tina said, school environment is most of the problem. You&#39;ll also  <br/>\nfind that 1) schools do not provide enough services as it is and that  <br/>\n2) most of the therapists are not well trained and the therapy is  <br/>\neither minimally helpful or sometimes even damaging. That was  <br/>\ncertainly our case. My oldest son had severe issues in the classroom,  <br/>\nthat the school would not address. We finally got it placed into an  <br/>\nIEP and then, the school didn&#39;t follow it. My daughter, who is  <br/>\nseverely autistic, had been in school since three (receiving services  <br/>\nsince two) The therapists did not know how to teach a child. Most of  <br/>\nthe time she would get maybe three hours of therapy a week. Most of  <br/>\nthat time was spent following a cookie cutter program that is not  <br/>\nfunctional for autistic children. Usually about February they&#39;d  <br/>\nfigure that out and just be stumped.<br/>\n<br/>\nPreschool programs often appear beneficial to those with  <br/>\ndisabilities. However, once the child ages out of the program, it&#39;s  <br/>\neven more difficult to find appropriate services (because in  <br/>\npreschool it&#39;s built into the program, older grades it is a pull-out  <br/>\nprogram) We had an excellent kindergarden year, because I had  <br/>\ndesigned a program from scratch and the school followed it. The  <br/>\nteacher was excellent and we had a one-on-one aid. Without all of  <br/>\nthat, it would have been a disaster. As it was in first grade! We  <br/>\nstill had the aid, but she wasn&#39;t trained. The teacher was out of  <br/>\ncontrol. The students were out of control. The school districts psych  <br/>\nfought with me all year about the fine line between appropriate  <br/>\nservices and creating a crutch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 27, 2008, at 6:55 PM, guideforthree wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; IDEA (Individuals with disabilities education act) states that the<br/>\n&gt; school district must provide services to all children residing in<br/>\n&gt; their district (or attending private school in their district).

Although he is now very<br/>\n  verbal, he didn&#39;t get the hang of spoken language until around 3-3.5 years.<br/>\n  We used a great deal of sign language with him, as well as written language<br/>\n  (he was able to read by 2, which made communication easier for sure!). Drew<br/>\n  was enrolled in public school for preschool, which was a special education<br/>\n  program specifically for Autistic kids. Although I had planned to<br/>\n  homeschool in some form, and had made that choice long before the children<br/>\n  were born, I felt that the services he received via the district (for free)<br/>\n  were needful, so we went that route. As it turns out, the preschool<br/>\n  environment was fantastic, he much enjoyed it and the adults involved were<br/>\n  all very loving and tuned in to the kiddos there. Just as your sister<br/>\n  fears, however, he was &quot;pushed through&quot; to Kindergarten at 5 and he was<br/>\n  *not* ready. In hindsight, I should have brought him home at that point.<br/>\n  Instead I allowed them to enroll him in a special ed K class. What a<br/>\n  disaster! It was partly that he wasn&#39;t ready, partly the horrible school he<br/>\n  was in (different from the preK school). We stuck it out (mostly because of<br/>\n  DH&#39;s not being ready to embrace homeschooling) until March, when a situation<br/>\n  dangerous to Drew finally woke me fully and I brought him home. <br/>\n<br/>\n  For the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>\n  routine, which he seemed to need. Looking back, I think that was because in<br/>\n  his preK class *they* had a very strict routine for the kids. Coupled with<br/>\n  most Autie&#39;s needs to have zero surprises in their life, this had reallly<br/>\n  conditioned Drew to expect rigid regularity. As it turns out, we did not<br/>\n  have a rigid home life outside of his school experience, and he did okay<br/>\n  with that, so not sure what I was thinking! Anyway, we used a strict<br/>\n  curriculum for 1st and 2nd grade, although by 2nd we were already falling<br/>\n  off the boat, so to speak. I realized that Drew could roll with the punches<br/>\n  much more and truly enjoyed being in charge of his own time. He does need a<br/>\n  lot of help to get in touch with his mental and emotional state in order to<br/>\n  change tracks, even when he wants to in order to do something wonderful<br/>\n  (like leaving a video game in order to go to Disneyland for the day), but<br/>\n  that&#39;s how it goes with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n  As far as services, Drew was receiving scanty services by K, and I honestly<br/>\n  did most of the work with him at home during the course of our regular day,<br/>\n  so we didn&#39;t miss the &quot;formal&quot; ones when they were gone. I *really* don&#39;t<br/>\n  miss the ABA therapy - I always felt that one was like training a dog, it<br/>\n  gives me the creeps! I do think these kids need help to adjust within our<br/>\n  world, but looking back at so many of the therapies Drew had, they were very<br/>\n  involved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL. Which I never have agreed<br/>\n  with. Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>\n  to fix him. He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different. That attitude switch<br/>\n  (when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>\n  son.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>\n  Autistic!? I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot; I tell them<br/>\n  that I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>\n  system who doesn&#39;t value my kids for Who They Are. IEP meetings, notes from<br/>\n  the teacher every day, stressed out kids who are biting their fingers (not<br/>\n  nails, fingers!) down to bleeding (at 5!!). Homeschooling takes a ton of<br/>\n  energy, but at least I see that we are all HAPPY and HEALTHY and WHOLE at<br/>\n  the end of the exhausting day. Sweet payoff, IMO. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Shell<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____ <br/>\n<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n  [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of Susan Wiltbank<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 27, 2008 7:33 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi All,<br/>\n  I have a question for those of you who unschool children with Autism. My SIL<br/>\n  is thinking of pulling her daughter Faith(5) from school to homeschool her.<br/>\n  Right now her and her brotherEdward (3), both diagnosed, go to a school set<br/>\n  up for children with &quot;special needs&quot;. They go to school and therapy 5 days a<br/>\n  week and have improved a lot. Sam is concerned that they will push Faith<br/>\n  through to Kindergarten even though she is not ready. You also have to<br/>\n  understand that both kids are non-verbal and do very little sign language.<br/>\n  This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t communicate to us what they want, they<br/>\n  just do it differently. Sam is concerned that Faith and Edward won&#39;t get the<br/>\n  community based services that they need, and is worried that she won&#39;t be<br/>\n  able to help Faith improve. Understandably, Sam wants her kids to be able to<br/>\n  lead as &quot;normal&quot; a life as possible and has fought to get all of the<br/>\n  services that they have now. Sam is naturally not an organized/schedule type<br/>\n  person and has been doing her very best to keep to a schedule for both of<br/>\n  her kids. When Faith&#39;s routine gets disrupted she gets very aggitated,<br/>\n  Edward usually just goes with it. So, do any of you unschool your children<br/>\n  who are non-verbal and have Autism and Sensory Integration Issues? If you<br/>\n  do, can you please give me an insight to your day. I&#39;m sure this would help<br/>\n  ease my SIL&#39;s mind and help her to decide if this is the right choice for<br/>\n  her and her family.<br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Susie<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":273703929,"authorName":"Susan Wiltbank","from":"&quot;Susan Wiltbank&quot; &lt;mommyswork2@...&gt;","profile":"swiltbanks","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism","postDate":"1201469798","msgId":29083,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEzMS1EQVYyQzhEMUYyREY2RDkzQjU0RUNBOTNGRTNCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTEzMS1EQVYxMjA5OUM1NEVBQ0ZEQ0I4RTIwRTdCRkUzQjBAcGh4LmdibD4gPEVCM0E0NDJDLTU2RjEtNEY4RS05Qzk4LTcyNkFENTQyOUY1RUBjb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":29080,"nextInTopic":29084,"prevInTime":29082,"nextInTime":29084,"topicId":29067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much.

You also have to <br/>\n  &gt; understand that both kids are non-verbal and do very little sign <br/>\n  &gt; language. This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t communicate to us what <br/>\n  &gt; they want, they just do it differently. Sam is concerned that Faith <br/>\n  &gt; and Edward won&#39;t get the community based services that they need, <br/>\n  &gt; and is worried that she won&#39;t be able to help Faith improve. <br/>\n  &gt; Understandably, Sam wants her kids to be able to lead as &quot;normal&quot; a <br/>\n  &gt; life as possible and has fought to get all of the services that <br/>\n  &gt; they have now. Sam is naturally not an organized/schedule type <br/>\n  &gt; person and has been doing her very best to keep to a schedule for <br/>\n  &gt; both of her kids. When Faith&#39;s routine gets disrupted she gets very <br/>\n  &gt; aggitated, Edward usually just goes with it. So, do any of you <br/>\n  &gt; unschool your children who are non-verbal and have Autism and <br/>\n  &gt; Sensory Integration Issues? If you do, can you please give me an <br/>\n  &gt; insight to your day. I&#39;m sure this would help ease my SIL&#39;s mind <br/>\n  &gt; and help her to decide if this is the right choice for her and her <br/>\n  &gt; family.<br/>\n  &gt; Thanks,<br/>\n  &gt; Susie<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65697424,"authorName":"Michelle Thedaker","from":"&quot;Michelle Thedaker&quot; &lt;pamperedthed@...&gt;","profile":"pamperedthed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism","postDate":"1201465450","msgId":29087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYzUwMWM4NjEyMiQ5MzcwMWU0MCQ4MjAwYThjMEBhbGllbj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEzMS1EQVYzOTVBMzQzQjlDNjg1RjM4OTJDNUJGRTNCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":29084,"nextInTopic":29115,"prevInTime":29086,"nextInTime":29088,"topicId":29067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Susie, I don t recall the ah ha! moment of realizing Drew could read, but we used one of those Magna Doodles to communicate with him for a long time and it ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1735548974\">Susie,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t recall the &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment of realizing Drew could read, but we used<br/>\none of those Magna Doodles to communicate with him for a long time and it<br/>\nwas awesome.  Although he understood spoken words, SEEING them was much more<br/>\neffective, so we wrote down a lot of instructions, i.e. &quot;put on shoes&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;leaving for the store&quot;, etc.  When it was verbal the words didn&#39;t stick as<br/>\nwell for him, as opposed to them being seen.  Once we started signing to<br/>\nhim, that also helped because it is another form of visual language.  I<br/>\noccaisionally still use sign with him now if he is having an especially<br/>\nunfocused moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the head banging, Drew used to do that also to the point where<br/>\nhe would bleed.

I would guess<br/>\n(just a guess since I don&#39;t know them nor have I seen their school<br/>\nenvironments) that stress is playing a big part in the overload issues.<br/>\nOnce Drew was brought home and could just BE, many of his stims (head<br/>\nbanging, nail bitting, head shaking) slowly went away.

We do a lot of swinging,<br/>\nrocking, deep pressure, used to do a lot of brushing with a sensory brush,<br/>\netc.  As he has matured, he doesn&#39;t need as much of this input, or he does<br/>\nfor himself in those areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;experts&quot; want us to believe that school and formal therapy is the #1<br/>\nbest place for our kids to be, but I disagree.  Home is a wonderful,<br/>\nhealthy, stress-free place for autie kids and they thrive there.  It does<br/>\ntake a large amount of energy and creative thinking to make it work, but IMO<br/>\nit is SO much better than the insanity we dealt with in the school system.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Susan Wiltbank<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 27, 2008 2:23 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell,<br/>\nThank you so much for your insight.

Although he is now very<br/>\nverbal, he didn&#39;t get the hang of spoken language until around 3-3.5 years.<br/>\nWe used a great deal of sign language with him, as well as written language<br/>\n(he was able to read by 2, which made communication easier for sure!). Drew<br/>\nwas enrolled in public school for preschool, which was a special education<br/>\nprogram specifically for Autistic kids. Although I had planned to<br/>\nhomeschool in some form, and had made that choice long before the children<br/>\nwere born, I felt that the services he received via the district (for free)<br/>\nwere needful, so we went that route. As it turns out, the preschool<br/>\nenvironment was fantastic, he much enjoyed it and the adults involved were<br/>\nall very loving and tuned in to the kiddos there. Just as your sister<br/>\nfears, however, he was &quot;pushed through&quot; to Kindergarten at 5 and he was<br/>\n*not* ready. In hindsight, I should have brought him home at that point.<br/>\nInstead I allowed them to enroll him in a special ed K class. What a<br/>\ndisaster! It was partly that he wasn&#39;t ready, partly the horrible school he<br/>\nwas in (different from the preK school). We stuck it out (mostly because of<br/>\nDH&#39;s not being ready to embrace homeschooling) until March, when a situation<br/>\ndangerous to Drew finally woke me fully and I brought him home. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>\nroutine, which he seemed to need. Looking back, I think that was because in<br/>\nhis preK class *they* had a very strict routine for the kids. Coupled with<br/>\nmost Autie&#39;s needs to have zero surprises in their life, this had reallly<br/>\nconditioned Drew to expect rigid regularity. As it turns out, we did not<br/>\nhave a rigid home life outside of his school experience, and he did okay<br/>\nwith that, so not sure what I was thinking! Anyway, we used a strict<br/>\ncurriculum for 1st and 2nd grade, although by 2nd we were already falling<br/>\noff the boat, so to speak. I realized that Drew could roll with the punches<br/>\nmuch more and truly enjoyed being in charge of his own time. He does need a<br/>\nlot of help to get in touch with his mental and emotional state in order to<br/>\nchange tracks, even when he wants to in order to do something wonderful<br/>\n(like leaving a video game in order to go to Disneyland for the day), but<br/>\nthat&#39;s how it goes with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as services, Drew was receiving scanty services by K, and I honestly<br/>\ndid most of the work with him at home during the course of our regular day,<br/>\nso we didn&#39;t miss the &quot;formal&quot; ones when they were gone. I *really* don&#39;t<br/>\nmiss the ABA therapy - I always felt that one was like training a dog, it<br/>\ngives me the creeps! I do think these kids need help to adjust within our<br/>\nworld, but looking back at so many of the therapies Drew had, they were very<br/>\ninvolved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL. Which I never have agreed<br/>\nwith. Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>\nto fix him. He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different. That attitude switch<br/>\n(when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>\nson.<br/>\n<br/>\nI laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>\nAutistic!? I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot; I tell them<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>\nsystem who doesn&#39;t value my kids for Who They Are. IEP meetings, notes from<br/>\nthe teacher every day, stressed out kids who are biting their fingers (not<br/>\nnails, fingers!) down to bleeding (at 5!!). Homeschooling takes a ton of<br/>\nenergy, but at least I see that we are all HAPPY and HEALTHY and WHOLE at<br/>\nthe end of the exhausting day. Sweet payoff, IMO. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nShell<br/>\n<br/>\n_____ <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nyahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n[mailto:unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nyahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;] On Behalf Of<br/>\nSusan Wiltbank<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 27, 2008 7:33 AM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ &lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nyahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism<br/>\n<br/>\nHi All,<br/>\nI have a question for those of you who unschool children with Autism.

Sam is concerned that they will push Faith through to Kindergarten even though she is not ready. You also have to understand that both kids are non-verbal and do very little sign language. This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t communicate to us what they want, they just do it differently. Sam is concerned that Faith and Edward won&#39;t get the community based services that they need, and is worried that she won&#39;t be able to help Faith improve. Understandably, Sam wants her kids to be able to lead as &quot;normal&quot; a life as possible and has fought to get all of the services that they have now. Sam is naturally not an organized/schedule type person and has<br/>\n been doing her very best to keep to a schedule for both of her kids. When Faith&#39;s routine gets disrupted she gets very aggitated, Edward usually just goes with it. So, do any of you unschool your children who are non-verbal and have Autism and Sensory Integration Issues? If you do, can you please give me an insight to your day. I&#39;m sure this would help ease my SIL&#39;s mind and help her to decide if this is the right choice for her and her family.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nSusie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65697424,"authorName":"Michelle Thedaker","from":"&quot;Michelle Thedaker&quot; &lt;pamperedthed@...&gt;","profile":"pamperedthed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism","postDate":"1201450125","msgId":29070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODcwMWM4NjBmZSRlNTg3NTM3MCQ4MjAwYThjMEBhbGllbj4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEzMS1EQVYxMjA5OUM1NEVBQ0ZEQ0I4RTIwRTdCRkUzQjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":29067,"nextInTopic":29072,"prevInTime":29069,"nextInTime":29071,"topicId":29067,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Susie, My eldest son Drew, who is now 8.5, is Autistic.

We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-668428624\">Susie,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest son Drew, who is now 8.5, is Autistic.  Although he is now very<br/>\nverbal, he didn&#39;t get the hang of spoken language until around 3-3.5 years.<br/>\nWe used a great deal of sign language with him, as well as written language<br/>\n(he was able to read by 2, which made communication easier for sure!).  Drew<br/>\nwas enrolled in public school for preschool, which was a special education<br/>\nprogram specifically for Autistic kids.  Although I had planned to<br/>\nhomeschool in some form, and had made that choice long before the children<br/>\nwere born, I felt that the services he received via the district (for free)<br/>\nwere needful, so we went that route.  As it turns out, the preschool<br/>\nenvironment was fantastic, he much enjoyed it and the adults involved were<br/>\nall very loving and tuned in to the kiddos there.  Just as your sister<br/>\nfears, however, he was &quot;pushed through&quot; to Kindergarten at 5 and he was<br/>\n*not* ready.  In hindsight, I should have brought him home at that point.<br/>\nInstead I allowed them to enroll him in a special ed K class.  What a<br/>\ndisaster!  It was partly that he wasn&#39;t ready, partly the horrible school he<br/>\nwas in (different from the preK school).  We stuck it out (mostly because of<br/>\nDH&#39;s not being ready to embrace homeschooling) until March, when a situation<br/>\ndangerous to Drew finally woke me fully and I brought him home. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first year or so I tried so hard to provide Drew with a strict<br/>\nroutine, which he seemed to need.  Looking back, I think that was because in<br/>\nhis preK class *they* had a very strict routine for the kids.  Coupled with<br/>\nmost Autie&#39;s needs to have zero surprises in their life, this had reallly<br/>\nconditioned Drew to expect rigid regularity.  As it turns out, we did not<br/>\nhave a rigid home life outside of his school experience, and he did okay<br/>\nwith that, so not sure what I was thinking!  Anyway, we used a strict<br/>\ncurriculum for 1st and 2nd grade, although by 2nd we were already falling<br/>\noff the boat, so to speak.  I realized that Drew could roll with the punches<br/>\nmuch more and truly enjoyed being in charge of his own time.  He does need a<br/>\nlot of help to get in touch with his mental and emotional state in order to<br/>\nchange tracks, even when he wants to in order to do something wonderful<br/>\n(like leaving a video game in order to go to Disneyland for the day), but<br/>\nthat&#39;s how it goes with him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as services, Drew was receiving scanty services by K, and I honestly<br/>\ndid most of the work with him at home during the course of our regular day,<br/>\nso we didn&#39;t miss the &quot;formal&quot; ones when they were gone.  I *really* don&#39;t<br/>\nmiss the ABA therapy - I always felt that one was like training a dog, it<br/>\ngives me the creeps!  I do think these kids need help to adjust within our<br/>\nworld, but looking back at so many of the therapies Drew had, they were very<br/>\ninvolved in FIXING him and making him NORMAL.  Which I never have agreed<br/>\nwith.  Of course I want him to lead a full and joyful life, but I don&#39;t need<br/>\nto fix him.  He&#39;s not broken, he&#39;s just different.  That attitude switch<br/>\n(when fully embraced) was a huge step forward in how I interacted with my<br/>\nson.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI laugh now when people say to me, &quot;You homeschool your kids, and one is<br/>\nAutistic!?  I just wouldn&#39;t have the energy to deal with that!&quot;  I tell them<br/>\nthat I don&#39;t have the energy - emotional especially! - to deal with a school<br/>\nsystem who doesn&#39;t value my kids for Who They Are.  IEP meetings, notes from<br/>\nthe teacher every day, stressed out kids who are biting their fingers (not<br/>\nnails, fingers!) down to bleeding (at 5!!).  Homeschooling takes a ton of<br/>\nenergy, but at least I see that we are all HAPPY and HEALTHY and WHOLE at<br/>\nthe end of the exhausting day.  Sweet payoff, IMO. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Susan Wiltbank<br/>\nSent: Sunday, January 27, 2008 7:33 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling children with Autism<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi All,<br/>\nI have a question for those of you who unschool children with Autism.
