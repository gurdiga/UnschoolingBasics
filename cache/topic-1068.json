","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-483450226\">&quot;I&#39;m happy to participate in a list where non-coercive parenting and loving<br/>\nguidance can co-exist with the goal of discussing unschooling as it&#39;s focus.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes...that&#39;s how it should be ideally.<br/>\nThere are a lot of us that don&#39;t see the separation between parenting issues and unschooling, but I know it was a journey for me and didn&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>\nI think one should expect to get questioned on any discussion list, and as the guidelines state, if you post it, expect a discussion.<br/>\nBut there is no need for all of us to be on the same page, nor is that the focus. It&#39;s going to come up from time to time though, passionate as unschoolers tend to be!:)<br/>\nMy hope is that the questioning I&#39;ve seen going on, can continue, that experienced folks can question also and share their own experience without anyone feeling overly defensive, and the list can offer a variety of creative ideas that help people unschool more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t a non-coercion list. I get ardently coercive if one of my children is harming another human being...whether verbally or physically. That person gets removed from the room and spends time with me elsewhere. I belive in setting boundaries for myself and try to help my children learn to stand up for themselves in regards to boundaries.<br/>\nSo yeah, coercion is not off limits in unschooling. I think living peaceably together is a better focus perhaps. Respecting other people&#39;s desires and needs as equally important to my own, living as a unit, rather than a dictatorship...those things are the priority around here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyhoo....I hope nobody thinks they have to totally understand all these side issues and apply them equally to participate in this list! It IS a &quot;basics&quot; list, but I have a hard time not speaking my mind....as you all know. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1067,"nextTopicId":1063}}
