They are in a safe, and comfortable <br/>\nenvironment, and can have fun, and just enjoy life while they learn <br/>\nabout things they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, we went out shopping, did some gardening/yard work, met <br/>\ntheir dad for a picnic during his lunch time, and went garage <br/>\nsaling.  Most of all, we just relaxed and had fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week, we went for a walk through the neighborhood, and noticed <br/>\nhow many houses were like ours, and how many were up for sale.  <br/>\nToday, we are having a movie/game day.  The weather is kind of <br/>\nyucky, so I&#39;m not sure we will get another walk in. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids seem more loving towards each other, and when there is a <br/>\nproblem between them, instead of walking away angry, we work on how <br/>\nthings could be different, and how we can problem solve.  It has <br/>\nreally worked out well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son and I talked about school (he brought it up), and I felt so <br/>\nbad for the things he had to go through.  It really messed with his <br/>\nself esteem.  Hopefully, we can bring it back up again in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all of you who have helped with suggestions and advice.  <br/>\nIt is really appreciated.  Please keep it coming.  Especially since <br/>\nwe are still new to this.  It is nice to have the freedom to do what <br/>\nwe want, when we want.  Life has changed for the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great week, and thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Vanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17138,"nextTopicId":17169}}
