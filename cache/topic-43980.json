I told him if he could manage to go along with the early mornings and hour drive I&#39;d make it worth his while.  He was six and seven at that time.  Making it worth his while meant making a cozy nest in the back seat of the car, getting the car nice and warm before taking off, letting him go in his pj&#39;s, packing along some favorite toys, stopping for breakfast and picking up his favorite treat on the way home.  He remembers those times very fondly now, those days having breakfast with his grandpa. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you describe seems harmless.  You&#39;re not withholding food or trading food for favors.  It seems more like a little family game more than anything else. You seem aware and tuned in to your kid so that if she stopped liking the game you&#39;d stop playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, who had no early life trauma to compare with your daughter&#39;s, was not a demonstrative person.  He was unusual in his family.  He would not hug.  After we were married he changed a lot and will hug family members.   My own family is not especially demonstrative, my siblings and I don&#39;t hug each other if we haven&#39;t been together in a long time.  We trade some scathing insults, call each other names, eat, play, someone might punch someone else - affectionately, of course.&lt;g&gt;   Dylan seems not to have a particular need for demonstrating affection, though he was a snuggly little kid and slept with us until he was seven.  He still hugs me sometimes but generally would rather not touch people.&lt;g&gt;   So, even if she rarely or never demonstrates affection she can have a happy life.  Not demonstrating affection is not the same as not feeling affection.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211463909,"authorName":"KimWW","from":"&quot;KimWW&quot; &lt;weikaimeng@...&gt;","profile":"weikaimeng","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Is bribing always wrong?","postDate":"1273687069","msgId":44015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzZXE2dCs1M2JwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsV0lyRGk3emp3U2VfcjlEc0pEVTZvNjBFNlJPSVlRUmI1WFRFdEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":44004,"nextInTopic":44028,"prevInTime":44014,"nextInTime":44016,"topicId":43980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She was adopted from China 2.5 yrs ago.

Especially with people for whom giving and receiving affection doesn&#39;t &quot;look&quot; like what is commonly expected. Mo doesn&#39;t often hug, rarely wants physical contact, and (as someone recently described her to me) only says exactly the number of words she&#39;s going to say. She doesn&#39;t &quot;look&quot; affectionate by conventional standards, and yet she is. She just expresses that differently. The few autistic kids I&#39;ve met also show affection differently from the norm - and because I&#39;ve been able to see that I&#39;ve had some really wonderful interactions with autistic kids. They don&#39;t lack the human need for affection, its simply expressed differently. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What are ways she shows her love to you? Look for those and enjoy them :)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********<br/>\n<br/>\nThat can be challenging if you&#39;re expecting affection to look a certain way. See little offers as big acts of affection - an offer to let you help, an offer to show you something of interest, an offer to spend time in your company. It can help to imagine your dd as &quot;bigger on the inside than on the outside&quot; - if she&#39;s letting you &quot;in&quot; at all, that&#39;s a big deal because it means she&#39;s taking the time and effort to look &quot;out&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Is bribing always wrong?","postDate":"1273637501","msgId":43991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0MTUzNi45MzkwOS5xbUB3ZWIxMTE3MjYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlsV0lyRGk3emp3U2VfcjlEc0pEVTZvNjBFNlJPSVlRUmI1WFRFdEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":43980,"nextInTopic":43994,"prevInTime":43990,"nextInTime":43992,"topicId":43980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hope you don t mind me saying something about the language too.  I have an autistic son who is 8 and says about 15 total words ...some of them more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1273322653\">I hope you don&#39;t mind me saying something about the language too.  I have an autistic son who is 8 and says about 15 total words ...some of them more approximations than words.

I figure she&#39;s had more than<br/>\nenough adults she could not count on to last a life time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for my post is this...the kid doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;get&quot; affection.<br/>\nCould be something she will come to understand in the fullness of time but<br/>\nI&#39;m worried she will not and her life as an adult will not be as full<br/>\nbecause she doesn&#39;t understand love.  Could be I&#39;m over-thinking this...I<br/>\nhave a habit of that.  But it is something I need to at least give<br/>\nconsideration to because her needs for affection and love went ignored or<br/>\nworse yet, punished from 4 weeks old until 2.5.  SO...to that end, if she<br/>\nwants a cookie or something like that (a want not a need) I will sometimes<br/>\nask &quot;can I give you a kiss?&quot;  and if she says no or ignores the request she<br/>\nstill gets the said item but most of the time she will offer her head and I<br/>\nwill kiss it twice (because she always wants two if she gets a kiss) and off<br/>\nshe goes.  It doesn&#39;t cause tears and we certainly do not pressure her.  But<br/>\nthe fact is, I&#39;m bribing her and I don&#39;t feel altogether good about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is likely on the Autism spectrum (hence needing two kisses even if she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want one) and so that&#39;s another thing complicating things.  I guess<br/>\nI&#39;d like to know some feedback on this since this isn&#39;t a child with normal<br/>\nbonding experiences and I&#39;m most concerned that she learn to bond and trust<br/>\nbecause that will be the basis for her to have a happy life as an adult and<br/>\npossibly a parent if she chooses to parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n&quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a<br/>\nnail.&quot; Abraham Maslow<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43992,"nextTopicId":43995}}
