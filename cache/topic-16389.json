But I do believe that if you apologize when you know you have been wrong and keep trying and considering your childs needs things will be ok. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just tonight my 3 year old wanted to go with me to target and walmart . We get to walmart and she wants to get out and walk...ok no prob I make the trip as quick as possible and we head to the register.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As I pay I start encouraging her to get in the basket , no luck. I warn her that once we get to the door she needs to hold my hand, be carried, or get in the basket. We get to the door and she has a fit. Im frustrated and tired so I pick her up and tell her I have to hold you...she screams her head off and I calmly walk to the car with a very quick explination of how cars cant see her. Then get her in her seat saying ok are you thirsty? do you want your shoes off?<br/>\n  When I think about it after the fact Im thinking hrmmm she prob would have responded well to being offered a back ride out to the car while I pulled the basket ...or she would have been safe enough if she pushed the basket with me. <br/>\n  Anyhow thing is When my now 7 year old was three I would have been out in the car telling her how dissapointed I was that she had acted that way and sadly feeling like I was doing the right thing because I wasnt spanking her or yelling at her. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Next-gen email?

I want to share that I have begun to pay attention even more to Ian and figure out what he needs.  For instance, today I took him to his older sister --so she could drive him up to his dads and Ian was well aware that he was going to his daddy&#39;s for a couple of days.  However, when we arrived at the meeting point Ian woke up from his cat-nap and was not happy to say the least.  So, I tried extra attention, hugging him, asking him what was &quot;wrong&quot;.  Basically I realize he does not like these transitions -- lately he&#39;s been fine but we&#39;ve been pretty tight this week and I think he just didn&#39;t want to go (he had stated this a couple time too during the week).  Anyway,  I did start to get upset at one point but I just got him back out of Amber&#39;s car one last time and looked at him and asked him if I actually took him back to &quot;sissy&#39;s&quot; house (where they were leaving from after they picked her husband up...) would that work??  And it did.  once I got there I<br/>\n went in their house for a few minutes put Ian in there car gave him one more hug and kiss and off we all went. Whew, that was much nicer.  In the past he has gone to his daddy&#39;s on a bad note and neither one of us wanted this!!   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I also wanted to mention to all of you at unschooling basics that I asked Ian what he would like rather than a spanking and he said for me to play with him... go figure:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _,_._,___         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Everyone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!

I&#39;ve taken the classes and even<br/>\nhelped teach them.  In a continuum of parenting, it&#39;s a better method than a<br/>\nlot of what&#39;s out there....but it&#39;s not something I endorse or follow any<br/>\nmore. Remember that the goal of Love and Logic is to raise responsible<br/>\nchildren. That can happen in lots of ways.  As with my move from<br/>\nschool-at-home homeschooling to unschooling, my move from Love and Logic<br/>\nparenting to mindful parenting was a gradual process. Something I wanted was<br/>\nchildren that were respectful and I found that Love and Logic wasn&#39;t a<br/>\nmethod that was respectful to my kids so how could I expect them to learn to<br/>\nrespect others.  I gradually began to adapt Love and Logic until I was not<br/>\nlonger using Love and Logic. Here&#39;s an example that I started by adapting<br/>\nuntil I saw it just wasn&#39;t a good way. In L&L, they want you to have<br/>\nresponsible children and an area that&#39;s addressed is laundry. They say that<br/>\nif your child forgets their laundry and leaves it in the washer or dryer,<br/>\nthen you should bag it up until they can &quot;earn&quot; the right to have it back.<br/>\nThe problem I had with this, is that it wasn&#39;t fair. I often forget laundry<br/>\nand what I want is for whoever is doing laundry and found mine is to have<br/>\nthem switch the load over.....what we have at our house is everyone happily<br/>\nmoves along whatever laundry is in process as they start their own. There<br/>\naren&#39;t any fights or hassles or shaming, it&#39;s just part of life with 6<br/>\npeople and one washer/dryer.  And through this my kids learn and experience<br/>\nrespect for themselves and others.  The other thing that drove me away from<br/>\nL&L was the lack of allowing for normal human forgetfulness and treating it<br/>\nall like a crime. I understand the goal is to help kids not expect to be<br/>\nrescued all the time...but they take it way too far. Life itself allows for<br/>\nthose opportunities without imposing them. They say if you&#39;re leaving to go<br/>\nsomewhere and as you leave a child suddenly remembers something they needed<br/>\nor wanted that you shouldn&#39;t turn around and go back, this way they will<br/>\nremember better next time. Well, I stopped that when I realized how often I<br/>\nturned around when I forgot something. If I was willing to do that for<br/>\nmyself or my spouse, shouldn&#39;t I also be willing to do that for my<br/>\nchildren?  And oddly enough, they are much better about remembering things<br/>\nthan I am!! I think my change all started with my early days of reading on<br/>\nthese lists and someone said that we should treat our kids the way we want<br/>\nto be treated and the way we would treat our spouse or friends.  I would<br/>\nnever treat my spouse or friends with the Love & Logic method....it would be<br/>\ndemeaning and condescending and down-right rude.  My kids are respectful and<br/>\nresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-20, Lisa-17, Karl-15, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/9/06, Rebecca De Hate &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebeccadehate@...\">rebeccadehate@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    OK folks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I just sent my first e-mail to unschooling basics and I felt<br/>\n&gt; compelled to write yet another one. I will get right down to the<br/>\n&gt; chase- I would like to lay out a scenario that led to my mother and<br/>\n&gt; I having a grand fight... Anyway I recognize that is a choice I made<br/>\n&gt; then and from the prospective I had at the time but I would like to<br/>\n&gt; see how you folks would have possible approached this... Understand<br/>\n&gt; too that I am searching the right way for my family to be at peace<br/>\n&gt; and really feel that I should un-school....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; OK here&#39;s the scenario. I had just taken my almost 4 year old<br/>\n&gt; camping with my girlfriend and her kids and we were heading home and<br/>\n&gt; he fell asleep for a bit. when he woke up he wanted to go to gramma<br/>\n&gt; (who live across from me) so I turned the car around and started in<br/>\n&gt; but then he changed his mind. so I pulled out of her drive way and<br/>\n&gt; stated that I think we should go home and take a nap -- which led<br/>\n&gt; into a tyraid which entailed screaming and kicking. So I took him<br/>\n&gt; to his room and shut the door and told him to take a nap. In which<br/>\n&gt; some where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but<br/>\n&gt; he didn&#39;t even want to be nice. Then after about an hour or two<br/>\n&gt; (which he did quiet down and stay in his room but didn&#39;t fall<br/>\n&gt; asleep -- oh- well). OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave<br/>\n&gt; him the choice to calm down and come out or take a nap, or he<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t go swimming -- then I took away going outside. (yikes I<br/>\n&gt; can just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love<br/>\n&gt; and logic -- choices.....) Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat<br/>\n&gt; I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time<br/>\n&gt; when it was time to come home (which he often does and then gramma<br/>\n&gt; assumes something drastic must be going on at home...) Yep you<br/>\n&gt; guessed it when it was time to come home Ian sat on his bike and<br/>\n&gt; refused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home<br/>\n&gt; nicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van. When I<br/>\n&gt; came back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him<br/>\n&gt; home which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he<br/>\n&gt; needed to ride home. Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian<br/>\n&gt; and tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home. but to no avail it<br/>\n&gt; ended up being another screaming scene. In which Ian also grabbed<br/>\n&gt; my hair and yanked so hard and I preseded to take him out and give<br/>\n&gt; him three spankings (yep -- real smart huh -- with sarcasm in my<br/>\n&gt; tone-- I know they don&#39;t work but???). I must say that even though<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I was loud I wasn&#39;t really mad at Ian as much as I was made<br/>\n&gt; at my mother for not just helping me put in the car and telling hime<br/>\n&gt; that he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; anything...) to say the least when I finally got him in the car and<br/>\n&gt; was taking him home and even though he pulled my hair even more,<br/>\n&gt; screamed bloody murder, and tried to kick me some more -- I just<br/>\n&gt; carried him in to the house and in to his room. (understand that I<br/>\n&gt; have tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I was holding him in a loving way...) I didn&#39;t yell or<br/>\n&gt; loose my cool I just told him to come out when he calmed down. Now<br/>\n&gt; when he came out still sobbing I just pulled him up on the couch<br/>\n&gt; with me and held him until he went to sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes<br/>\n&gt; and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences<br/>\n&gt; behind them. From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is<br/>\n&gt; to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life. The<br/>\n&gt; concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a<br/>\n&gt; smile.. which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face<br/>\n&gt; even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or<br/>\n&gt; leave grammas, or ....<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, please, give me your thoughts and I will keep reading more<br/>\n&gt; stuff on un-schooling and start slowing infusing these ideas and<br/>\n&gt; concepts.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Messages in this topic<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/16389;_ylc=X3oDMTM3MjlxanUzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAMxNjM4OQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawN2dHBjBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQEdHBjSWQDMTYzODk-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/16389;_ylc=X3oDMTM3MjlxanUzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAMxNjM4OQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawN2dHBjBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQEdHBjSWQDMTYzODk-</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (1) Reply (via web post)<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJyMzQyZzY0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAMxNjM4OQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNycGx5BHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-?act=reply&messageNum=16389\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJyMzQyZzY0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRtc2dJZAMxNjM4OQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNycGx5BHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-?act=reply&messageNum=16389</a>&gt;|<br/>\n&gt; Start a new topic<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJmNjdob25tBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNudHBjBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/post;_ylc=X3oDMTJmNjdob25tBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNudHBjBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Messages&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/messages;_ylc=X3oDMTJmdGJtODYzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNtc2dzBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/messages;_ylc=X3oDMTJmdGJtODYzBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNtc2dzBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-</a>&gt;|<br/>\n&gt; Files&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files;_ylc=X3oDMTJnYTVhYTl2BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNmaWxlcwRzdGltZQMxMTU1MDk5Mzc0\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/files;_ylc=X3oDMTJnYTVhYTl2BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNmaWxlcwRzdGltZQMxMTU1MDk5Mzc0</a>&gt;|<br/>\n&gt; Photos&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/photos;_ylc=X3oDMTJmNmtodnJmBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNwaG90BHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/photos;_ylc=X3oDMTJmNmtodnJmBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNwaG90BHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-</a>&gt;|<br/>\n&gt; Polls&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/polls;_ylc=X3oDMTJnbzNqdjU1BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNwb2xscwRzdGltZQMxMTU1MDk5Mzc0\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/polls;_ylc=X3oDMTJnbzNqdjU1BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNwb2xscwRzdGltZQMxMTU1MDk5Mzc0</a>&gt;|<br/>\n&gt; Members&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/members;_ylc=X3oDMTJma3ZlY2ttBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNtYnJzBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/members;_ylc=X3oDMTJma3ZlY2ttBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTYwMDA4MTk3MgRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNtYnJzBHN0aW1lAzExNTUwOTkzNzQ-</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  [image: Yahoo!

In real life I can rest in front of the tv or the<br/>\ncomputer or while reading a book or while laying on the grass watching<br/>\nclouds or while playing with a piece of clay or coloring in a book or<br/>\njust sitting talking with other people.  Yes; your son probably needed<br/>\nwas tired, but given the two options which neither sounds good, he<br/>\nchose the other option which was to push at those options with<br/>\nresistance.  Same with going home from grandma&#39;s house.  It looks like<br/>\nthey found a third option in having grandma walk him home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like these LOVE AND LOGIC classes are geared towards<br/>\n&quot;logical for the parents&quot; rather than &quot;logical at all.&quot;  In real life<br/>\nif I decide that I want grandma to walk me home rather than go with<br/>\nmom or go in the car, my consequence is not going to be being forced<br/>\ninto a car anyway.  The consequence might be that mom feels a little<br/>\njealous, unless mom decides to walk with us in which case all three of<br/>\nus can have fun together.  Forcing a child to choose between two poor<br/>\ndecisions so that *your* life is easier (which I doubt it is based on<br/>\nwhat you are writing) is just another form of coercive parenting.  You<br/>\naren&#39;t really helping your child make choices for himself (which in<br/>\nthe real world there would be more than two choices).  You are forcing<br/>\nyour child to conform to what you want to do by limiting his choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps in responding to your child when he is tired you could say,<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m exhausted after that camping trip (which is the only thing you<br/>\n*can* say truthfully, because to say that he is tired is assuming<br/>\nsomething that you can only do by looking at cues, not knowing how he<br/>\nreally feels).  When we get home, I think I am going to veg in front<br/>\nof the tv for a while before (whatever - unloading the car, going to<br/>\ngrandma&#39;s, taking a shower, etc.)  Wanna join me?  Maybe we could<br/>\nwatch that movie we&#39;ve been wanting to see.&quot;  Who knows, being in a<br/>\ncalm and relaxing environment he might have fallen asleep or he might<br/>\nhave just gotten enough rest.  Also, it might not hurt to have an<br/>\n&quot;exit strategy&quot; with grandma about other ways to leave without fuss.<br/>\nPerhaps have grandma walk half way.  Perhaps have grandma not say<br/>\nthings like, &quot;I&#39;m going to miss you&quot; (which may make your son feel<br/>\nlike he is hurting grandma somehow).  Perhaps having something equally<br/>\ngood waiting for him at home (a movie and popcorn or a swim or a book<br/>\nyou are reading, etc.)   &quot;After we leave grandma&#39;s we can come home<br/>\nand work on this puzzle.

You turned *him* into the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In which<br/>\n&gt; some where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but<br/>\n&gt; he didn&#39;t even want to be nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would *you* want to be nice to people who decided what you needed and  <br/>\nthen made you do what they decided you needed to?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your husband discovered a new religion and decided you needed  <br/>\nit and dragged you to church every Sunday? Would his conviction that  <br/>\nhe was right and his making you do what he &quot;knew&quot; you needed make you  <br/>\nsee how right he was? Would it fill you with love for him that he was  <br/>\nmaking you do what he knew was best for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dealing with kids it&#39;s helpful to see the world how *they&#39;re*  <br/>\nseeing it rather than how you&#39;re seeing it. From his point of view  <br/>\nhe&#39;s feeling irritable. The last thing he wants is people bossing him  <br/>\naround!<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to gain his trust that you&#39;re there to help him rather than there  <br/>\nto impose the solution you&#39;ve decide is best for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s irritable/tired try soothing music, rocking him, a snack,  <br/>\nread or watch TV snuggled under the covers. Let him fall asleep on  <br/>\nyour shoulder. (That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about which memory you&#39;d hope he&#39;d keep of you when he&#39;s grown:  <br/>\nbeing shut in his room and told to take a nap or snuggling under the  <br/>\ncovers and falling asleep against you. That&#39;s often a good test of  <br/>\nwhether a solution is one that&#39;s working towards a better  <br/>\nrelationship. &quot;Is this a memory I&#39;d like him to have of me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave<br/>\n&gt; him the choice to calm down and come out or take a nap, or he<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t go swimming -- then I took away going outside.  (yikes I<br/>\n&gt; can just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love<br/>\n&gt; and logic -- choices.....)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those weren&#39;t the only two choices available. You narrowed his world  <br/>\nto two choices that you would let him have and made him pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want liver or kidney for dinner? If you don&#39;t pick either, you  <br/>\ncan&#39;t go to the movie with the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoices are good for kids who get overwhelmed by choice. We can help  <br/>\nthem by narrowing the possibilities down for them. We can say would  <br/>\nyou like the Spongebob shirt or the Dragonball Z shirt. But that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they *have* to wear one of those two. That doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthey can&#39;t have a cookie if they decide it&#39;s a no shirt day ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat<br/>\n&gt; I explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time<br/>\n&gt; when it was time to come home<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is about making life convenient for you rather than helping him  <br/>\nnavigate the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *are* inconvenient! They do make life more difficult. But those  <br/>\ninconveniences are part of the package that we chose to take on when  <br/>\nwe decided to have them. Adults look at kids lives and think how  <br/>\ngreat it is not to have responsibilities and think childhood is  <br/>\nglorious and then they get irritable when kids get demanding. If feel  <br/>\nlike kids have the best of the world and they&#39;re asking for more.  <br/>\nThey have the whole pie and they&#39;re asking for ours too. But it isn&#39;t  <br/>\nglorious. It really sucks being a kid because you&#39;re so powerless.  <br/>\nYou can&#39;t do many of the things you want because you&#39;re too small.  <br/>\nYou have to ask permission for or help with so many things and then  <br/>\nwait to see if it&#39;s convenient for an adult to do it for  you. From a  <br/>\nkids&#39; point of view it&#39;s not a lot different than being in prison.  <br/>\nEverything they do is because they&#39;re parents are allowing them to.  <br/>\nThey know the privilege of doing it can be taken away at any moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we can make their life different. Because we have the power to do  <br/>\nso.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about everything you do in the day and imagine having to ask  <br/>\nyour husband to help or give you permission. If you want a bowl of  <br/>\ncereal or cup of coffee, how long would he make you wait until it was  <br/>\nconvenient for him to stop his &quot;important things&quot; to get it for you?  <br/>\nIf you wanted a new book to read from the library, would it be  <br/>\nseveral days before he could find a spot in  his schedule to stop by  <br/>\nthe library for you? What if you were full of feelings you didn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand and he started yelling at you and ordering you around to  <br/>\nmake you do what he thought would fix you and stop you from being so  <br/>\nirritating?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yep you<br/>\n&gt; guessed it when it was time to come home Ian sat on his bike and<br/>\n&gt; refused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home<br/>\n&gt; nicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which then turned into a power struggle. You&#39;ve created a situation  <br/>\nwhere you two are adversaries: either he does what you think is best  <br/>\nfor him out of two choices or you make him choose and then take  <br/>\nprivileges away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you want your best friend to treat you like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nBe his partner. You know he has problems with transitions. Give him a  <br/>\nreminder as the time to leave is approaching. Don&#39;t say it in a  <br/>\nwarning tone! ;-) Give him information. &quot;Ten minutes until we leave.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd then *help* him leave by offering something to look forward to.  <br/>\nSympathize with his feelings. Accept them. They&#39;re real, honest  <br/>\nfeelings. Don&#39;t feel it&#39;s your job to fix his feelings but do feel  <br/>\nit&#39;s your job to create a nest for him to recover in. Tell him about  <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s going *to* rather than focusing on what he&#39;s leaving. Go  <br/>\nget a cookie at home and watch TV. Get some hot chocolate. Play a  <br/>\ngame on the way home like &quot;I Spy&quot;. You won&#39;t necessarily stop the  <br/>\ntears -- that isn&#39;t yours to control! -- but you can control the  <br/>\natmosphere around him whether it&#39;s a pleasant one or one that feeds  <br/>\ninto his sadness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of leaving as like losing a pet. Telling him he better not be  <br/>\nupset when his dog dies isn&#39;t likely to make him not upset! Help him.  <br/>\nBe his partner.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I<br/>\n&gt; came back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him<br/>\n&gt; home which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he<br/>\n&gt; needed to ride home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your mom was right! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal was to get him home. You turned the goal into making him do  <br/>\none of the two choices you&#39;d offered. I&#39;d apologize to her! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian<br/>\n&gt; and tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can put ketchup on your liver if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know they don&#39;t work but???<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re at the &quot;but ...&quot; stage because you see your goal as making him  <br/>\ndo what you&#39;ve decided is right. When you let go of the control,  <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a need to make him do something. The goal is to help him  <br/>\nget what he needs. Look at *him* rather than where you&#39;re trying to  <br/>\nget him. If he&#39;s upset, soothe him!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to react to situations before they happen. There  <br/>\nprobably wasn&#39;t much you could do about the nap in the van that he  <br/>\nwoke up cranky from. We all have bad moments! But when it&#39;s possible,  <br/>\nit&#39;s better to tend to their needs before they start spiraling  <br/>\ndownhill. It takes some maturing for kids to understand the subtle  <br/>\nfeelings. They don&#39;t recognize or find it easy to not pay attention  <br/>\nto hungry. But at some point it gets to starving and they can&#39;t  <br/>\nignore it and it&#39;s overwhelming. Feed them before they realize  <br/>\nthey&#39;re starving. Help them wind down before they get over tired. If  <br/>\nyou know a situation always ends badly, plan ahead -- with things  <br/>\n*you* can do to help rather than demanding a different response.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I must say that even though<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure I was loud I wasn&#39;t really mad at Ian as much as I was made<br/>\n&gt; at my mother for not just helping me put in the car and telling hime<br/>\n&gt; that he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do<br/>\n&gt; anything...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I think your mom was right! ;-) You&#39;d switched goals from getting  <br/>\nhome to him obeying you. I think it was right of her not to help.  <br/>\n From her point of view you&#39;d turned into a tyrant!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (understand that I<br/>\n&gt; have tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not sure I was holding him in a loving way...)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Different kids need different responses. Some kids like being held,  <br/>\nsome just like mom nearby. But it&#39;s more useful to discuss -- and  <br/>\npeople can tell you what has worked for their kids who&#39;ve melted down  <br/>\n--  when their meltdowns are about the world not cooperating rather  <br/>\nthan when you&#39;ve created the frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes<br/>\n&gt; and they had said to give the children choices but with consequences<br/>\n&gt; behind them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is all about control. It&#39;s a technique for making the child do  <br/>\nwhat the parent wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting is about listening to the child and helping him get  <br/>\nwhat he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is<br/>\n&gt; to help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well to that I say :-P ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers -- and all kids who are under school age -- are already  <br/>\nliving real life. Real life already presents us with choices that  <br/>\nhave consequences. Real choices. Real consequences. There&#39;s no need  <br/>\nto practice. The only people who need to practice at real life are  <br/>\nones who are in school, locked away from real life growing up in an  <br/>\nartificial reproduction of real life -- that ultimately doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nresemble real life at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal choices are: &quot;Would you like to go swimming now in the morning  <br/>\nthough it&#39;s a bit cool or wait for the afternoon though it might  <br/>\nrain.&quot; And real choices have the option of &quot;none of the above&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;love and logic&quot; feels like math word problems. &quot;You have 70  <br/>\ncents and apples cost 25 cents. How many apples can you buy?&quot; In real  <br/>\nlife we can buy a pack of gum instead. Or save up. Or ask mom for  <br/>\nmore money. Or pool our resources with our sister. Or ....<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life is *way* more instructive than making up artificial choices  <br/>\nand artificial consequences. Real life is chaotic and very satisfying  <br/>\n*because* we&#39;re pulling something orderly from the chaos :-) not  <br/>\nbecause we figured out the one and only right answer. We may not  <br/>\nalways come up with the best solution but coming up with something  <br/>\nfrom chaos that works is satisfying and builds confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The<br/>\n&gt; concept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a<br/>\n&gt; smile..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does it really help if I offer you the choice of liver or kidney with  <br/>\na smile or not? Yucky choices that you&#39;re being forced to take  <br/>\ndelivered with a smile ... Well, think of it this way, if you wanted  <br/>\nto create a villain, you&#39;d have him deliver his choices of death by  <br/>\ndrowning or death by fire with a smile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face<br/>\n&gt; even when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or<br/>\n&gt; leave grammas, or ....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And which hero would you cheer for? The one who cowed down and chose  <br/>\nto be drowned or the one who fought for what he believed was right?<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny how the aspects of personality we admire most in adults are the  <br/>\nones that we deride so much in children. Being independent and  <br/>\nstanding up for what you believe *is* inconvenient for others. But if  <br/>\nwe&#39;re their partner in helping them get what they&#39;re trying to get  <br/>\nrather than their controller trying to make them do what we want life  <br/>\nis a lot more pleasant :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184269211,"authorName":"Rebecca De Hate","from":"&quot;Rebecca De Hate&quot; &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt;","profile":"rebeccadehate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"A pre-view into a newbie from MI&#39;s child rearing","postDate":"1155098053","msgId":16389,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGViYm9rNStsMnFpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16391,"prevInTime":16388,"nextInTime":16390,"topicId":16389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK folks, I just sent my first e-mail to unschooling basics and I felt compelled to write yet another one.

I will get right down to the <br/>\nchase-  I would like to lay out a scenario that led to my mother and <br/>\nI having a grand fight... Anyway I recognize that is a choice I made <br/>\nthen and from the prospective I had at the time but I would like to <br/>\nsee how you folks would have possible approached this...  Understand <br/>\ntoo that I am searching the right way for my family to be at peace <br/>\nand really feel that I should un-school.... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOK here&#39;s the scenario.  I had just taken my almost 4 year old <br/>\ncamping with my girlfriend and her kids and we were heading home and <br/>\nhe fell asleep for a bit.  when he woke up he wanted to go to gramma <br/>\n(who live across from me) so I turned the car around and started in <br/>\nbut then he changed his mind.  so I pulled out of her drive way and <br/>\nstated that I think we should go home and take a nap -- which led <br/>\ninto a tyraid which entailed screaming and kicking. So  I took him <br/>\nto his room and shut the door and told him to take a nap.  In which <br/>\nsome where in there I think he could have came out on the couch but <br/>\nhe didn&#39;t even want to be nice.  Then after about an hour or two <br/>\n(which he did quiet down and stay in his room but didn&#39;t fall <br/>\nasleep -- oh- well).  OH I forgot during his time in his room I gave <br/>\nhim the choice to calm down and come out or take a nap, or he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t go swimming -- then I took away going outside.  (yikes I <br/>\ncan just see all of you cringing -- but I thought I was giving love <br/>\nand logic -- choices.....)  Anyway before we went to grandmas to eat <br/>\nI explained to him that I didn&#39;t want him to give me a hard time <br/>\nwhen it was time to come home (which he often does and then gramma <br/>\nassumes something drastic must be going on at home...)  Yep you <br/>\nguessed it when it was time to come home Ian sat on his bike and <br/>\nrefused to move so I told him that he had a choice to ride home <br/>\nnicely or I would go get the van an take him home in the van. When I <br/>\ncame back to get him in the van my mother was starting to walk him <br/>\nhome which I informed her not to that he made his choice and he <br/>\nneeded to ride home.  Now I tried to even be nice about it to Ian <br/>\nand tell him that he could even &#39;drive&#39; home.  but to no avail it <br/>\nended up being another screaming scene.  In which Ian also grabbed <br/>\nmy hair and yanked so hard and I preseded to take him out and give <br/>\nhim three spankings (yep -- real smart huh -- with sarcasm in my <br/>\ntone-- I know they don&#39;t work but???). I must say that even though <br/>\nI&#39;m sure I was loud I wasn&#39;t really mad at Ian as much as I was made <br/>\nat my mother for not just helping me put in the car and telling hime <br/>\nthat he needed to go home (not tell him that she just &quot;couldn&#39;t do <br/>\nanything...)  to say the least when I finally got him in the car and <br/>\nwas taking him home and even though he pulled my hair even more, <br/>\nscreamed bloody murder, and tried to kick me some more -- I just <br/>\ncarried him in to the house and in to  his room.  (understand that I <br/>\nhave tried holding him in the past but he just gets more mad -- but <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I was holding him in a loving way...) I didn&#39;t yell or <br/>\nloose my cool I just told him to come out when he calmed down.  Now <br/>\nwhen he came out still sobbing I just pulled him up on the couch <br/>\nwith me and held him until he went to sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow in my eyes at the time I had taken some LOVE AND LOGIC classes <br/>\nand they had said to give the children choices but with consequences <br/>\nbehind them.  From what I understand the LOVE AND LOGIC concept is <br/>\nto help prepare children for the future -- for &#39;real&#39; life.  The <br/>\nconcept also wants you to deliver these positive choices with a <br/>\nsmile.. which I find hard when my child starts screaming in my face <br/>\neven when I am just explaining to him why we need to go inside or <br/>\nleave grammas, or ....  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  please, give me your thoughts and I will keep reading more <br/>\nstuff on un-schooling and start slowing infusing these ideas and <br/>\nconcepts.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16478,"nextTopicId":16481}}
