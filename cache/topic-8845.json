I have to get my ex to agree to this.  <br/>\nTechnically, I don&#39;t have to have it in stone, but he lives across the <br/>\ncountry and could decide to throw a fit over it and file in his state <br/>\n(Utah) for custody over this apparent educational &quot;neglect&quot;.  He made <br/>\nrumblings about it before, when I was only homeschooling dd and he is <br/>\nmore finicky about ds. He is a real jerk in general and would probably <br/>\nlove any excuse to continue to make my life hell.  Therefore, I really <br/>\nneed to be certain about this method of homeschooling before I try and <br/>\nsell it to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nApril, I live in Charlotte... for now.  We are considering moving.  <br/>\nChoice A would be to Lansing, to be closer to dh&#39;s work, sell 1 car to <br/>\nhelp pay off bills.  Then the excuse to ex-husband for homeschooling <br/>\nwould be the crappy inner-city Lansing schools.  Choice B, which we <br/>\nare also considering, is moving far north to the Alpena area.  My <br/>\nhusband has elderly parents, he is the heir of 40-120 acres of land... <br/>\nlong story short we have discovered Joel Salatins&#39; farming method and <br/>\nSally Fallon&#39;s nutritional texts and have thought of living off the <br/>\nland, essentially unschooling and farming at the same time.  The <br/>\nexcuse to ex-husband this time would be the hour-long bus ride and <br/>\npoor-quality rural schools.  Whaddayathink??  I prefer Choice B.  <br/>\nChoice C would be just staying here in Charlotte until we can whittle <br/>\nour bills down.  I don&#39;t know what argument to use to switch to <br/>\nhomeschooling, as ex doesn&#39;t care about my &quot;non-tangible&quot; worries over <br/>\nmy childrens&#39; struggling spiritual welfare in the public school arena.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s my sitch... Thanks for askin&#39;!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKathie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8844,"nextTopicId":8847}}
