Use your discount card with the <br/>\npurchase. Maybe even pick up something for yourself. Then go sit in <br/>\nthe cafe and have a snack - make a day of it! Then take all the <br/>\nstuff home and let her use it at will. If she does it all in one <br/>\nday, okay. If she does two pages and then it sits on the shelf, <br/>\nokay. If she does one page a week for a few months, okay. If she <br/>\ngets them home and doesn&#39;t touch them, sell them on ebay or <br/>\nvegsource in a year or two (with her okay that she&#39;s not needing <br/>\nthem at that point). It may simply be that she needs to &#39;prove&#39; to <br/>\nherself she could do it IF she wanted to. Kind of like it took a <br/>\ncouple of bedtime reading sessions with the Bob books to convince DS <br/>\nthat he could read.
