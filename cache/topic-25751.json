Not that I want to deny myself anything but <br/>\nkeeping it simple and unscheduled is best for me- I have never found <br/>\nthat planning classes or outings just for me really helps me relax or be <br/>\nmore connected. I try to minimize time away from home as my kids have <br/>\nmore than enough ideas of things that involve getting in the car. <br/>\nSleeping and resting enough and eating well and having a good book are <br/>\npretty wonderful- and knowing that my kids are happy and healthy and <br/>\nthat we have enough. Sometimes I am glad that we struggle a bit with the <br/>\nbasics at times as I see people around me who have the basics very well <br/>\ncovered and seem to invent other  problems for themselves- moms who are <br/>\ndoing this and that and the other thing for themselves but still seem <br/>\nunsatisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do find that reading unschooling lists is really a great thing for <br/>\nrejuvenating myself- I always read something that is just perfect for <br/>\nwhere I am right now.
