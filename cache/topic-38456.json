Two of my favorite math teachers in middle/high school were women<br/>\n(pre-algebra and calculus). But then again that was back in the middle<br/>\nages and the whole &#39;space race&#39; and all - late 60s through the 70s (high<br/>\nschool class of &#39;79) - when there was still a huge focus on developing a<br/>\ngeneration of math/science professionals and not so much emphasis on<br/>\nstandardized testing. We learned the &#39;shortcuts&#39; right along with the<br/>\ntextbook methods and the patterns and whys of things not just rote<br/>\nstuff. We had the time to explore the ideas with the teacher rather than<br/>\nplow through in time for a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat attitude is really paying off because, by verbalizing my plan of<br/>\nattack when dealing with numbers, DS is now using the same methods. Not<br/>\nnecessarily textbook, but quick and accurate. He told me that the other<br/>\nday he added 3100+3050 in his head by first adding 3000+3000 then adding<br/>\n100+50 then adding 6000+150 to get 6150. That&#39;s exactly how I would have<br/>\ndone it. Comes from lots of playing with numbers with him - a favorite<br/>\ncar game was for him to reel off strings of numbers for me to<br/>\nadd/subtract/multiply/divide and he&#39;d be pretty amazed that I&#39;d get the<br/>\nanswer pretty quickly after he got to the end of the string. On<br/>\noccasion, when he asked, I&#39;d go back and show him how I handled it.<br/>\nSometimes he&#39;d make it a challenge match between me and DH to see who<br/>\ncould answer faster. And sometimes he&#39;d think up &quot;word problems&quot; for us<br/>\nwhich usually devolved into silliness because we&#39;d ask him questions<br/>\nabout the things in the &quot;problem&quot; - If you are making 3 apple pies and<br/>\nyou&#39;ve got 15 apples, how many more apples do you need? Would have<br/>\nquestions like &quot;how big are the apples? How big is the pie pan? What<br/>\nkind of apples are they? Which recipe are you using? Do any of the<br/>\napples have worms in them?...&quot; and it would go downhill from there :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
