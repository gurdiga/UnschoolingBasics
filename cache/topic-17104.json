But with some transitions in<br/>\ncareers I am now a WAHM and SAHM.  My husband is a financial<br/>\nconsultant/insurance agent with a large company.  I am independent in the<br/>\nsame field.  My girls are 11 & 14 so they can stay at home if I need to be<br/>\nout.  I try to do most of my work on a M,W,TH schedule.  That doesn&#39;t mean I<br/>\nam always away on those days.  I may just work at home a couple of days and<br/>\nbe out one day.  My dh&#39;s schedule is flexible so sometimes he won&#39;t schedule<br/>\nanything during the morning time so he can spend some time with our girls or<br/>\nhe might spend an eveing with them. For the most part he is always home on<br/>\nthe weekends.  It has been challenging at times as we have had to iron out<br/>\nsomethings.  Right now we need both incomes while my dh is getting<br/>\nestablished.  We are just starting our second year in this new career.  We<br/>\nhave to be creative sometimes, but we always seem to make it work.  I put<br/>\nalittle aside each paycheck for our fun stuff.  We also give our girls $5 a<br/>\nweek plus I have a list of money earning opportunities they can take<br/>\nadvantage of if they want to.  They pay for their wants and we pay for the<br/>\nneeds. It has worked well so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey I. in SC - Mom to Rachael 14 & Madison 11<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.405 / Virus Database: 268.11.7/435 - Release Date: 8/31/2006<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16998,"nextTopicId":17105}}
