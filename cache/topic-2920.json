While they say that they have<br/>\nhomeschoolers in their best interest, they have been known to defend<br/>\n&quot;homeschoolers&quot; who are sheltering their children due to abuse issues.<br/>\n (yuck)  They are actually pro-more regulation of homeschoolers than<br/>\nless-regulation (thus making it more difficult to homeschool than<br/>\neasier - and ironically their reasoning for this is to discourage<br/>\npeople from abusing the homeschool laws so that they can cover abuse -<br/>\ngo figure!)   They&#39;ve also beein involved in some lobbying that has<br/>\nnothing to do with homeschooling (that I can see) and is of a<br/>\npolitical agenda that I do not support (conservative right wing).  I<br/>\nalso question the outrageously high association fee when compared with<br/>\nthe work that they are doing directly for homeschoolers.  IMO, if<br/>\nthere was some reason why the school board would take me to court it<br/>\nwould probably infringe on my civil liberties more than it would my<br/>\n&quot;homeschooling rights&quot; so the ACLU (of which I am a card carrying<br/>\nmember) would be a better defense than HSLDA.
