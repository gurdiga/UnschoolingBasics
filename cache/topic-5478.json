I can feel a subtle yet important shift in where I am at with<br/>\nit in my head.... like I can feel a shift in the weight of responsibility<br/>\nfrom me to my son for his education.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think I have started noticing a little more about where he is at... ie: a<br/>\nfriends schooled daughter stayed the night recently and Daniel helped her<br/>\nwith her maths homework.  He is 11, she is 14.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI want to have some more conversations with him about his being responsible<br/>\nfor his education, and me being an enthusiastic supporter of whatever he is<br/>\ninto.  I was wondering if there are any articles that I could point him to<br/>\nthat maybe have been written by unschooled teens to explain the unschooling<br/>\nphilosophy to him so that he can get a better fix on what I am trying to do<br/>\nwith him.  I think I need to &quot;come out of the closet&quot; with him!  It into<br/>\nthat I have been hiding there, but I guess because I have not been clear in<br/>\nmyself what I want to do here, I havn;t had that conversation with him<br/>\neither.  All I know is that everytime I read any unschooling stuff I just<br/>\nget a big YES inside, and that&#39;s because it feels so natural.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to Pam (I think?) for those book recommendations.
