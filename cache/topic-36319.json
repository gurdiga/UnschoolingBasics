How to be a better friend and how to understand<br/>\nall the different relationships you find yourself in. I&#39;m a Christian, so<br/>\nit&#39;s written from that viewpoint, but if you don&#39;t like that tack there is<br/>\nplenty of general life stuff anyway. I&#39;m finding a publisher at the moment -<br/>\nin Australia, though. If you&#39;re interested in reading some of it you can<br/>\nemail me offlist and I&#39;ll send you the manuscript or at least bits of it. I<br/>\ndo have one chapter on &#39;how to survive high school&#39; but for the most part<br/>\nit&#39;s more general than that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cecilypaterson@...\">cecilypaterson@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCiao, Cecily<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Marla B.<br/>\nSent: Friday, 3 October 2008 12:20 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [SPAM][unschoolingbasics] Re: Books for dealing with issues between<br/>\nunschooled teen girls<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for non-fiction. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough, unschooled kids do seem to get along a lot better than<br/>\npublic schooled kids, they still have some of the same issues most<br/>\nteens have.
