We chose early on to read parenting books <br/>\nand look for our way to care for our children.  Homeschooling he was on board for, <br/>\nunschooling has, unfortunately, derogatory things associated with it by the media, family, <br/>\netc.  So my goal is to find a good way to better explain it to him so he can help and feel he <br/>\nis part of it.  Yes he works a lot...if he could work from home I think he would.  He is a <br/>\nfabulous father and loves his kids dearly.  He is worried about laziness and responsibility.  <br/>\nWe have been discussing that along with budgeting and how we can be lazy and <br/>\nirresponsible at times.  That we like to sleep in till noon on Saturdays when we can, so why <br/>\nnot the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this in a kind way and show him the kids have a vast knowledge.  My eldest wrote his <br/>\nfirst novel and my DH was surprised at the child&#39;s language skill.  Deep down, you are <br/>\nright, he KNOWS it is working.  He just can&#39;t see why.  He is a programmer and software <br/>\ndeveloper always looking to fix puzzles and I think unschooling is a bit of a puzzle he is <br/>\nstill trying to figure out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think part of it is maybe a little resentment on his part that he wasted 4 years in <br/>\nHigh School going to 4 different high schools (father was Air Force at the time) and <br/>\ndealing with &quot;ignorant and unintelligent&quot; teachers.  That he didn&#39;t get to play as much as <br/>\nhe would have liked, etc.  We have all been there!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I just needed your post to see it from a different angle.

So start collecting <br/>\n&gt; anything that the child did - drawings, photos of the activity, or <br/>\n&gt; maybe a monthly or quarterly write up from you assesing that <br/>\n&gt; individual child&#39;s learning personality, noting down everything from <br/>\n&gt; conversations to the the child&#39;s &quot;realisations&quot;.

I make alot of things available, I can be <br/>\n&gt; quite a horder, so it&#39;s not difficult LOL! The more things I have, <br/>\n&gt; the more &quot;sightings of learning&quot; I get. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; You could provide computers games. I find pc educational games is <br/>\n&gt; great fun for my kid and some of them have progress tracking system <br/>\n&gt; whereby you can print out for your hubby to look. Online <br/>\n&gt; Time4Learning is another fun site that tracks and print the child&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; progress. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Photographs tells alot of stories. I take pix alot and I show hubby, <br/>\n&gt; relating the experience in educationese- language. Like when we <br/>\n&gt; built Lego structures, I called it Design Technolgy (DT) sessions. <br/>\n&gt; Or when we read, depending on what we&#39;re reading, it&#39;s can be <br/>\n&gt; called  history, understanding punctuations or Drama (we&#39;re reading <br/>\n&gt; out to each other in different characters and tone of voice.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maths is everyday learning, from money counting to count down to <br/>\n&gt; birthdays. Algebra will come naturally only when it start making <br/>\n&gt; sense to the my kid. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My child is going to be 8 in 2 months time, but already he see sense <br/>\n&gt; in why we study trigonometry - because we had teh chance to learn <br/>\n&gt; how to measure a tree with a stick in hand. But this deosn&#39;t mean <br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s into trigonometry. It&#39;s just a mere aquintance. I took note of <br/>\n&gt; this because I know we will come across this subject again in the <br/>\n&gt; future.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Learning about angles is strong in his mind tho, because he <br/>\n&gt; understood trajectory thru his medieval arrow shooting game.

Her idea of printing the state checklist and <br/>\nticking it is a good idea. Not only it&#39;s something that hubby could <br/>\nsee, but it can also show him how spread out your kids&#39; learning is <br/>\ngonna be- a good reason why unschooling works. Natural learning does <br/>\nnot happen in perfect sequence. You might see that your child&#39;s <br/>\ninterest spread across 2, if not 3 grades, like mine do. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like all hubby is asking for, is some subtle encouragement <br/>\n(evidence) that everything is going alright academically. Does you <br/>\nhusband work alot? Mine do. When they are away a good part of the <br/>\nday, daily, they don&#39;t have the luxury of spending time with our <br/>\nchildren, hence alot of our kids doing, learning and Eureka&#39;s is <br/>\nmissed out. Even tho the husbands can see that unschooling is <br/>\nworking, but how and what exactly is making it work, they have no <br/>\nidea. Which might explained thier uncertainty. <br/>\n<br/>\nA portfolio is a catalouge of your child. So start collecting <br/>\nanything that the child did - drawings, photos of the activity, or <br/>\nmaybe a monthly or quarterly write up from you assesing that <br/>\nindividual child&#39;s learning personality, noting down everything from <br/>\nconversations to the the child&#39;s &quot;realisations&quot;. This portfolio (i <br/>\nused a carton box) can be re-arrange sometime later.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?  Do you ask <br/>\nyour children to do &gt; homework or do you just leave things out for <br/>\nthem to forage through if they are interested?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI allow my son to forage. I make alot of things available, I can be <br/>\nquite a horder, so it&#39;s not difficult LOL! The more things I have, <br/>\nthe more &quot;sightings of learning&quot; I get. <br/>\n <br/>\nYou could provide computers games. I find pc educational games is <br/>\ngreat fun for my kid and some of them have progress tracking system <br/>\nwhereby you can print out for your hubby to look. Online <br/>\nTime4Learning is another fun site that tracks and print the child&#39;s <br/>\nprogress. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhotographs tells alot of stories. I take pix alot and I show hubby, <br/>\nrelating the experience in educationese- language. Like when we <br/>\nbuilt Lego structures, I called it Design Technolgy (DT) sessions. <br/>\nOr when we read, depending on what we&#39;re reading, it&#39;s can be <br/>\ncalled  history, understanding punctuations or Drama (we&#39;re reading <br/>\nout to each other in different characters and tone of voice.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMaths is everyday learning, from money counting to count down to <br/>\nbirthdays. Algebra will come naturally only when it start making <br/>\nsense to the my kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy child is going to be 8 in 2 months time, but already he see sense <br/>\nin why we study trigonometry - because we had teh chance to learn <br/>\nhow to measure a tree with a stick in hand. But this deosn&#39;t mean <br/>\nhe&#39;s into trigonometry. It&#39;s just a mere aquintance. I took note of <br/>\nthis because I know we will come across this subject again in the <br/>\nfuture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning about angles is strong in his mind tho, because he <br/>\nunderstood trajectory thru his medieval arrow shooting game. He <br/>\nneeded &quot;a word&quot; to explained to me why his arrow didn&#39;t reached the <br/>\ntarget- where he was going wrong. Hence I told him it&#39;s called <br/>\nangles. And soon, he&#39;s started rattling away about at what angle-<br/>\ndegree the arrow will fly past the target, but if he keeps it 30 -40 <br/>\ndegree, the arrow will go up and travel back down perfectly. In <br/>\neducationese terms he&#39;s learnt science and maths. And hubby comes <br/>\nback, I&#39;ll intigate son to show daddy his &quot;cool new arrow game&quot; of <br/>\nwhich son will be spouting all this maths&#39; lingo. <br/>\n<br/>\nEverything can be documented, and if we plot this on the standard <br/>\neducation structure, we&#39;ll see that our child&#39;s realisation of such <br/>\nacademic subjects is all over the place. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t worry about highschool because we don&#39;t see son going there, <br/>\nbut son still have this romantic notion of college, so that&#39;s <br/>\nmy &quot;vague&quot; focuspoint. But really, to how I see it, when it&#39;s his <br/>\ntime for college in 7 yrs time, who&#39;s to say what&#39;s the requirements <br/>\nthen? As it is now, it&#39;s possible for our kids to do A levels in a <br/>\ncorrespondence course. There&#39;s even online virtual classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m thinking, if it&#39;s college he decides on, I&#39;m convinced that <br/>\nhe&#39;ll ace any subjects including Maths, when there&#39;s a need for it. <br/>\nSo, for now, we&#39;ll just focus on what&#39;s relevant now and next year.<br/>\nI have read of unschooling kids&#39; who&#39;s never done any academic <br/>\nsubjects before, finishing thier GCSE&#39;s Maths in under 6 months.  <br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   And if they have asked you to find something or get something <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for them to use and then they don&#39;t use it, then what?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have asked for many bottles of perfumes, but I don&#39;t use them all, <br/>\nall the time LOL! <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have asked for it because at that point of asking, <br/>\na &quot;realisation&quot; has hit them.

Very basic unschooling issues!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do you reconcile unschooling and responsibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We think really hard about how people learn to be responsible. Why are  <br/>\nWE responsible? Do you do dishes, now, because your mother made you do  <br/>\nthem when you were ten years old? Why do you wash (or not wash) your  <br/>\ncar? Why do you make (or not make) your own bed? Do you do laundry? Do  <br/>\nyou take your own dishes from the living room to the kitchen? Why why  <br/>\nwhy? &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do what &quot;I&quot; want to do. I choose to usually take my dishes to the  <br/>\nkitchen because I have figured out that the consequences of leaving  <br/>\nthem sitting out in the living room are negative - they pile up and  <br/>\nget in the way, things get spilled, they attract ants, the food cakes  <br/>\non and they get harder to wash, the dog knocks them over and things  <br/>\nget broken, etc. Oh yeah - pretty much all of those have happened, to  <br/>\nme, more than once. I take showers because - I like the feeling of  <br/>\nbeing clean, I suppose. And I don&#39;t want to offend people around me by  <br/>\nbeing smelly. And I like the feeling and look of my hair being clean  <br/>\nand flowy, rather than a little dirty/oily and clinging to my head.   <br/>\nThat&#39;s what I mean by &quot;ask why you do things.&quot; Figure out your own  <br/>\nmotivations. Do any of those really need to be created in some way by  <br/>\nsomeone else?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe act responsibly most of the time - because we know that our own  <br/>\nintegrity is important - we carry through on things we say we&#39;ll do  <br/>\nbecause we want people to trust us. We aren&#39;t responsible because our  <br/>\nparents made us do chores. We&#39;re responsible because we &quot;now&quot; see the  <br/>\nreasons for doing certain things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Do you ask your children to do homework or do you just leave things  <br/>\n&gt; out for them to forage through if they are<br/>\n&gt; interested?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We do not have any kind of required academic work at all. No lessons,  <br/>\nno assignments, no required reading, no reports due, no testing or  <br/>\ngrading. The next question is often, &quot;But, then, how do they know what  <br/>\nthey need to know for college?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they choose college, they will figure out what is needed and  <br/>\nprepare themselves for it. My kids are now 23, 20, and 17 - one has  <br/>\ngraduated from college, one is attending college full time, one has  <br/>\ntaken some college courses. With NO academic requirements, they still  <br/>\nlearned all they needed to know to get into college and do well. It is  <br/>\nvery possible. In fact, their experience in college was that they were  <br/>\nbetter students than most of the other students who had spent 13+  <br/>\nyears &quot;preparing&quot; for college.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think by &quot;leave things out&quot; you might be referring to academic/ <br/>\nschool-type things. If you leave a math book out, will they eventually  <br/>\npick it up and &quot;do it?&quot; Probably not. They don&#39;t need school-type work  <br/>\nto learn the things school tries to teach them. They can learn to do  <br/>\nbasic arithmetic, for example, MUCH more effectively, if you keep  <br/>\nthose math book away from them and allow them the freedom to learn  <br/>\nnaturally, from situations that come up in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And if they have asked you to find something or get something for  <br/>\n&gt; them to<br/>\n&gt; use and then they don&#39;t use it, then what?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;To use?&quot; Like, &quot;Mommy, buy me that algebra book?&quot; And then it turns  <br/>\nout it was a mistake and it is boring and they don&#39;t want to do it  <br/>\nanymore? It happens. Try not to spend a lot of money on stuff that  <br/>\nlooks like conventional school materials - they tend to be mediocre  <br/>\nand kids tend to lose interest even though they might have sounded  <br/>\nlike a good idea at the time. IN fact, try to find other ways to offer  <br/>\nthe same opportunity to learn. If they say they want to learn to speak  <br/>\nSpanish, don&#39;t go out and buy a Spanish book - think about some ways  <br/>\nto introduce just a little Spanish into their lives. Think small. This  <br/>\nis like you might introduce new foods. Maybe they&#39;re interested in  <br/>\nsushi - wouldn&#39;t you offer a sample and then maybe a meal (with some  <br/>\nalternatives just in case they didn&#39;t like it that much), not an  <br/>\nentire year&#39;s menu based on it? This is a great list for getting ideas  <br/>\n- not for academic programs/workbooks/textbooks - but for ways to  <br/>\nsupport a child&#39;s interest in just about anything! And, yes, let them  <br/>\ndrop it if they lose interest. Absolutely. Do you want to make them  <br/>\nabsolutely hate it? Well, then force them to continue against their  <br/>\nwill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My DH is just the best...and we don&#39;t usually disagree.  But I hate  <br/>\n&gt; the typical school at<br/>\n&gt; home idea and the fighting with my kids over it--so I don&#39;t or  <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t.  My DH disagrees<br/>\n&gt; and says that although most of our unschooling has been great that  <br/>\n&gt; we need to do certain<br/>\n&gt; things on a regular basis...Math for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So - here&#39;s the deal with math. Schooling has made MOST people  <br/>\nslightly math-anxious and many people extremely math-phobic. Of all  <br/>\nthe school subjects, that is the one that schools are doing the worst  <br/>\njob on. That is the LAST one you ought to single out to &quot;do school&quot;  <br/>\nwith. Better to &quot;school everything but math&quot; rather than &quot;unschool  <br/>\neverything but math.&quot; (I&#39;m not recommending either of those options,  <br/>\nthough.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided many years ago to at least &quot;do no harm&quot; to my little  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s natural love of numbers, patterns, puzzles, and games (in  <br/>\nother words, math). So - no formal math was done to them. We played a  <br/>\nLOT. We talked about ideas that involved mathematical concepts like  <br/>\nmore and less (when they were little) and approaching infinity (when  <br/>\nthey were older). We used arithmetic in normal life ways. They learned  <br/>\nto do all the usual &quot;prealgebra&quot; stuff - adding and subtracting,  <br/>\nmultiplying and dividing whole numbers and fractions. They noticed  <br/>\nexponents here and there and figured those out. They used decimals and  <br/>\npercentages and noticed how decimals, fractions, and percentages could  <br/>\nbe interchanged and which were more useful for various purposes. It  <br/>\nall happened without conscious effort - all in the context of doing  <br/>\nother things they wanted to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlgebra? No - it doesn&#39;t just happen naturally (well, lots of  <br/>\nalgebraic thinking does, but not formal algebra). Each of them was a  <br/>\nlittle interested in algebra at some time in their teen years - enough  <br/>\nto sort of look at it and get a feeling for what it was about, but not  <br/>\nenough to actually work through a formal course. The older two  <br/>\neventually chose to go to college and there they took algebra and  <br/>\nactually quite enjoyed it. They looked forward to it, didn&#39;t dread it,  <br/>\nhad no preconceived notions about it being difficult or confusing.  <br/>\nThey were a little disappointed in math teachers, in general, who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t bother with helping students understand why things work or when  <br/>\nyou&#39;d want to use it, but just want students to memorize how to work  <br/>\ncertain kinds of problems. But they realized that was the teacher&#39;s  <br/>\nproblem, not their problem, and they would ask me or google around and  <br/>\nget their own answers, when they really wanted them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Even mentioning doing homework makes  the children run to the 4  <br/>\n&gt; winds....<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah- so take a hint.... &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So how do you do it?  I have 3 very different children.  they learn  <br/>\n&gt; differently, very different<br/>\n&gt; interests and attitudes.  I am sure you have similar situations.  I  <br/>\n&gt; have pulled up<br/>\n&gt; appropriate websites, let them check out books, things like  <br/>\n&gt; that...how do you show they<br/>\n&gt; know or have what is needed for each year for the school district  <br/>\n&gt; (portfolio, etc...) and if<br/>\n&gt; you only use 1 or 2 items for each subject in a portfolio, do you  <br/>\n&gt; need to do anything<br/>\n&gt; throughout the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have a very limited idea of how kids can learn. Your repertoire of  <br/>\nideas is small. It is like you think music only consists of two  <br/>\npossible styles - let&#39;s see, reggae and classical - and when your kids  <br/>\nwant to listen to music, that&#39;s ALL you can think of to offer. There  <br/>\nis a whole world of ways to learn out there - you just don&#39;t see it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as documenting what they do - most of us don&#39;t have to do that.  <br/>\nDepends on what state you live in. If you let us know which state it  <br/>\nis - someone here will be able to specifically help you with how to  <br/>\nmeet the legal requirements for your own state.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind - learning is learning whether or not it is documented.  <br/>\nDocumenting doesn&#39;t make it any more valid or valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about high school?
