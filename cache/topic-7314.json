Did she say that in a good way <br/>\nor a bad  way?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***************<br/>\n <br/>\nThis particular time she said it in a positive way, but she has certainly  <br/>\nmeant it negatively, too.<br/>\n <br/>\n*****888And, yes, it is Jalen, my wonderful nephew!!!!  He is a  <br/>\nhooooooooot!!!  And you know what is so great about him, and other  <br/>\nkids like him?  He is VERY good at articulating what he needs, I  <br/>\nlove that!  There were times at the conference when he would come to  <br/>\nRen and say, &quot;Mom, I haven&#39;t seen you in a while and I NEEEEED  you.&quot;*****<br/>\n <br/>\nOne day, we drove by a strip center and it was busy with some sort of  little <br/>\nexhibition of fire and rescue trucks.  My 5 year old wanted to go  and Nick, <br/>\n9, did not.  After pleading him for a bit, Emmy said &quot;well, why  exactly to <br/>\nyou not want to go?  Maybe we can figure something out that  would work for both <br/>\nof us?&quot;  Nick, who is very challenged in speech and  language thought for a <br/>\nminute and said &quot;I don&#39;t like to talk to people I don&#39;t  know.&quot;  Emmy said, <br/>\n&quot;Mom, can you talk for Nick?&quot;  I said of course and  she asked if that would work <br/>\nfor him.  He agreed and we went and had a  great time.<br/>\n <br/>\nI loved it.   Emmy knew Nick was uncomfortable about something  and she <br/>\nfigured out how to help him articulate it.  He wasn&#39;t afraid  to express his fear.  <br/>\nThey both trusted me enough that I would hold up my  end of the solution and <br/>\nnot let him get into an uncomfortable situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor me, this small event was a huge deal.  How many different ways  this <br/>\ncould have gone and ending up with someone hurt or upset?  I had very  little to <br/>\ndo with their exchange, but I know how much work on my part laid the  ground <br/>\nwork for it.  I think it is things like this that a typical family  would gloss <br/>\nover, they would think I was really lucky to have kids that get  along and <br/>\nlook out for each other.  But I know that every time I asked them  their opinion <br/>\nand did my best to act on it gave them the freedom and  trust to solve a <br/>\nproblem and follow-through.  Something many adults  can&#39;t do!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7312,"nextTopicId":7317}}
