I have stopped doing all of these things, but I too have the need for the kids to go along with the day, without constant argument and negotiations.  I have 3 boys, 5,8 &13.  I see my mirror image in my 13 year old who I have to remind not to scold the kids, not to worry that they are being noisy, not to threaten them with loss of something.  YUCK!  I hate that I have taught him these behaviors.  I am hoping that my being steady and reliably open, supportive etc--not reverting back to old ways, that I will create NEW patterns for him too.  I wonder if there will be a shift within them in the next year or so, where maybe their need to argue and constantly negotiate the plans changes a bit  Maybe if they feel more validated and can trust me more, they won&#39;t have that need to butt heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still learning new ways of dealing with negative behavior that they have, and trying to really breath thru those times when I feel frustrated and at a loss.  I tend to just try and hug them and kiss them and remind them how much I love them....seems like a pretty big shift happens then.  And saying yes as often as possible feels pretty good.  I will admit it feels like I am sneaking twinkies out of the house though...that ugly voice that asks me &quot;Is that ok to just play paintball all day?  Shouldn&#39;t he be DOING something educational?&quot;  Formal education is truly so indoctrinated in my being, that I have to have these little conversations with myself all day long.  Like a mother and child arguing together.  I hope that part of the path goes away, but I am an overthinker, so I wonder....<br/>\n<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Childhood is a journey, not a race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] when kids tune you out","postDate":"1206487125","msgId":31269,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwMzI1MTYxOHIxZDMyZTBkOW41NWEwZDhmYjVkMGZiYTUyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUxRUVGNDEyLTM1QjEtNEVFRC05NEYyLUQ2MEQwQjVCQjQyNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODAzMjUwMjIwcDIzYjg1YzVkdGUzOTY2ZmIyNTU4NTYxZGFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8RTFFRUY0MTItMzVCMS00RUVELTk0RjItRDYwRDBCNUJCNDI2QG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":31267,"nextInTopic":31271,"prevInTime":31268,"nextInTime":31270,"topicId":31254,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Tue, Mar 25, 2008 at 3:11 PM, Pamela Sorooshian  ...
