But he has been passionate about <br/>\nrobots for 3 years!  He is most into combat robots, although he also <br/>\nis really interested in robots in space, like the Mars Rover.  He has <br/>\ndesigned many robots, most on paper, quite a few with Legos or now <br/>\nK&#39;Nex.  We have a huge K&#39;Nex robot kit that builds real, programmable <br/>\nrobots.  We&#39;ve played with that some.  We are currently working on <br/>\nmodifying a Battlebots RC toy to make it combat ready.  It involves <br/>\nchanging a lot of the electronics and body, but you use the basic <br/>\nremote and computer card, so you don&#39;t have to do the programming. <br/>\nHere is a webpage that describes how to do it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.robotcombat.com/marketplace_rcbattlebots.html\">http://www.robotcombat.com/marketplace_rcbattlebots.html</a> <br/>\nWe plan on trying to fight it in the under 1 pound category.  They <br/>\nhave competitions all over the country for that size robot.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sozbots.com/\">http://www.sozbots.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s favorite shows about robots are Battlebots (which isn&#39;t <br/>\ncurrently on the air, but I have a lot of them on tape, and we <br/>\nrecently bought the DVD of the first season), Robot Rivals, this is <br/>\non DIY Friday nights.  2 college teams compete to see how can build a <br/>\nrobot that does a specific task in a set amount of time.  We&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned so much from that show!  I know one of the guys on the show <br/>\nhas a non-profit to teach kids about robotics.  You can look them up <br/>\non the DIY webpage. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of good kits for building robots, also places where <br/>\nyou can buy parts and design your own.  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.robotmarketplace.com/\">http://www.robotmarketplace.com/</a><br/>\nHas your son built any robots yet?  That is really where he needs to <br/>\nstart, just building.  He will learn much more by doing than he ever <br/>\nwill by reading about it.  One of the best books about building <br/>\nrobots that I&#39;ve read is called The Absolute Beginners Guide to <br/>\nBuilding Robots.  Check your library, mine had lots of book on robot <br/>\nbuilding.  I checked them all out and found the one that worked best <br/>\nfor me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173749108,"authorName":"Sharon Thomas","from":"&quot;Sharon Thomas&quot; &lt;meplusfive@...&gt;","profile":"meplusfive","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Fwd:  RE: [unschoolingbasics] math questions","postDate":"1091634079","msgId":2504,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMTEwMzlGLjAwMDAwNC4wMjU4NEBKSU0tMldNU1VRRVFKWEc+","referencesHeader":"PGNlcXV2byt2Zmw5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2501,"nextInTopic":2524,"prevInTime":2503,"nextInTime":2505,"topicId":2501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**I have to tell you, math hasn t been any part of what we are doing, beyond measuring stuff to make sure it will fit.** Christy, that is great! definitely","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1805134337\">**I have to tell you, math hasn&#39;t been any part \r<br/>\nof what we are doing, beyond measuring stuff to make sure it will fit.**\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nChristy,\r<br/>\n   that is great! definitely something I needed to hear.

Most robot builders don&#39;t have degrees in it.  They just build a <br/>\nlot of robots.  They keep playing with designs and building them <br/>\ndifferently until they get ones they want.  I think this is field <br/>\nwhere college really isn&#39;t necessary.  Has he read up on some of the <br/>\nbig name robot builders?  Like the guys on Myth Busters or the guys <br/>\non Robot Rivals?  I believe that practical hands on experience is <br/>\nmuch more important than theoretical math when it comes to robot <br/>\nbuilding.  Can he build a robot and take it to a robot combat <br/>\ncompetition?  He would meet so many robot builders there and find out <br/>\nwhat is really involved in making a career out of it.  My son and I <br/>\nare working on our first robot and I know nothing about any of it.  <br/>\nI&#39;m learning as we go.
