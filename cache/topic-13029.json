However, the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1360381296\">I second you on Playful Parenting!  Once I was able to turn hitting and angry looking behavior into a game, life became easier for me and mine.  However, the key is that I had to be willing to play the game.  So when my near 3 year old STILL hits because he is not happy about something, often times I will say, &quot;OOOOHHH!  You got me!  That hit was really hard!&quot;  And I will fall out and act very hurt in a really funny and wild way.  He laughs and hits me for more of that reaction and then we are able to go forward either moving on to something else or I will assist him with what he wants.  With my first son I did not get it at first but someone mentioned playful parenting.  I never actually read it but knew what it meant.  I have become more childlike and finds that it works with dealing with my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the other thing we have to do is to not care what others think.  Sometimes it is easy to interpret our children&#39;s behaviors to others as malicious, vindictive, or whatever because we are embarrassed.  I have come to realize that everyone&#39;s children have their moments and while my child is having his moment now, no doubt one day it will be theirs.  So I have learned to not be embarrassed and instead use the moment as a time to connect or to help my child manage his emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned that playing with my children in the tense moments ease the stress and allows us to regroup way more quickly than anything else I have tried.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Angela Berry <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 15, 2006 1:09 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well said Pam.
