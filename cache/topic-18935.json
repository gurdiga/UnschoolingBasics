So I&#39;m going to lurk around and soak up all the wisdom, and see how the heck I can make this work and still keep the State of Kentucky out of my life. <br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Vickisue Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vickisue_gray@...\">vickisue_gray@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 16, 2006 5:16:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling, but excited to start!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like your answer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still, also, new to the educational concept of unschooling vs homeschooling.

We tried the &#39;homeschooling&#39; when we first pulled my son out just about a year ago, half way through 2nd grade, and it was a real pain in the butt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my MIL had a stroke last Feb., and we had to race up to Ga, to be with her, we packed up the books and took them along.  I came home to prepare things for my MIL to move in and left my spouse and son there with MIL.  When they came home, there were no books.  The school books remained in GA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past week as I was packing for a return trip to MIL&#39;s house to prepare it for winter, my son informed me that he had intentionally hid the books from dad so he wouldn&#39;t need to do the &#39;schoolwork&#39;. Lol, such a devious little mind.  He spent the spring and summer reading whatever he wanted, playing video and computer games he liked and just plain enjoying life and our farm.<br/>\n<br/>\nCome August when the public school started, I tried once again to get him on track with a curriculum.  What a miserable time we had of it.  He didn&#39;t want to sit and &#39;do school&#39;.  I didn&#39;t want my days like that either.  Besides, it turns out he knew most of the material for third grade already!  From all his reading, he knew sentence structure and phrasing and had an extensive vocabulary.  I asked him to read his third grade science book.  He loved it but wanted to just read it cover to cover not in &#39;lesson&#39; style of two pages a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured why not.  After he finished, he informed me he already knew what they covered and more just from watching his favorite channel, Animal Planet and The Most Extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to say I have the total concept of &#39;unschooling&#39; down.  It&#39;s nearing the time to do our first required evaluation and as I was gathering his work to present to the evaluator, I started getting really nervous.  Then I looked at his stuff from a year ago and his recent stuff.   He has grown by leaps and bounds.  Without penmanship lessons, his writing has improved wonderfully.  He has taught himself to type by writing his stories on his blog page.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year proves to me that children (or at least mine) will learn and explore more when just given the room to do it.  This group really helps keep things in perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, November 16, 2006 3:26:10 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling, but excited to start!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: johevili72@yahoo. com<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I ascertain and make sure<br/>\nmy children will have a well rounded education.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you define &quot;well-rounded education&quot; for us?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThose of you with experience in Unschooling, have you been<br/>\nsuccesful in just letting your children take the lead and let you<br/>\nknow what they want to learn?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you define &quot;successful? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you &#39;create interest&#39; by just<br/>\nputting out the books and materials and letting them pursue what<br/>\ninterests them from that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have varied interests alread.

We&#39;re hardwired to make connections and pull  <br/>\npatterns out of chaos. We crave to make sense of it.

They can  <br/>\ntransform into 10-2 and 4+4 and 2*4.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how it&#39;s natural to learn. It doesn&#39;t make sense. It seems  <br/>\ntotally inefficient, and yet it&#39;s how we&#39;re designed. It&#39;s not at all  <br/>\nnatural for us to have some one else make sense out of that chaos and  <br/>\ntry to feed it to us in some linear order.

That&#39;s what most people picture when they think of  <br/>\nchildren taking the lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 7-8, after spending 2 months in 2nd grade to try it out,  <br/>\nshe drew pages and pages and pages of giant colored asterisks. She  <br/>\ncalled them snowflakes but they looked like asterisks. I have no clue  <br/>\nwhat was going on during that time but whatever it was, she needed to  <br/>\ndo it. Towards the end she saw a stapler on the floor and drew an  <br/>\namazing likeness of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 8-9 she started drawing this comic book series about her  <br/>\nalter-ego Avn the Cat. Pages and pages and pages. She played a lot of  <br/>\nvideo games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was 10-11 she watched *a lot* of Nickelodeon and Cartoon  <br/>\nNetwork. She didn&#39;t want to go places though she took a couple of art  <br/>\nclasses. She only wanted to play with one friend since that friend  <br/>\nwas the only one who would play the type of pretend she liked. She  <br/>\nsaid she had writer&#39;s block. I don&#39;t know what was going on there  <br/>\neither (though I&#39;ve heard a lot of unschooling parents say their kids  <br/>\nwere passionate about cartoons at that age..) It&#39;s a preteen shifting  <br/>\nof world views and interests. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a holding  <br/>\npatterns as they shift from kid interests to more mature interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12 she started drawing her comics again. (And still going at 15.)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe actually loaded some of her early stuff up at ComicGenesis:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://avnhisky.comicgenesis.com/d/20050617.html\">http://avnhisky.comicgenesis.com/d/20050617.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(The story with those characters is still going on!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also read a lot of picture books, mostly stories. We read and  <br/>\nlistened to on tape a lot of adult and young adult books like Harry  <br/>\nPotter and Artemis Fowl. Then she discovered manga (Japanese comics)  <br/>\nand we&#39;ve read a ton of those together. We also did a few other  <br/>\nthings, but what I&#39;ve written pretty much characterized what she was  <br/>\ndoing at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 13 she decided to take the college statistics class her father  <br/>\nteaches. Her test scores were always either highest or within  a few  <br/>\npoints of highest. But she did it because it was fun. That year she  <br/>\nalso decided to try the National Novel Writing Month challenge to  <br/>\nwrite a 50,000 word novel in 30 days which she managed to do. Which  <br/>\nshe also did just because it was fun. (We&#39;re both half way through  <br/>\nour third time at it right now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the previous years look like they were leading up to anything  <br/>\nresembling that. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *no one else&#39;s* journey or destination is going to look anything  <br/>\nlike that. Most kids won&#39;t draw comics. Most kids won&#39;t take college  <br/>\nclasses at 13. Most kids&#39; unschooling is going to look a lot like  <br/>\nplaying with some trips and activities for fun with parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you &#39;create interest&#39; by just<br/>\n&gt; putting out the books and materials and letting them pursue what<br/>\n&gt; interests them from that?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When we&#39;re transitioning from school-think, it&#39;s easy to get caught  <br/>\nin the idea of trying to get certain information into them in  <br/>\nwhatever way possible. So the idea of strewing sounds like leaving  <br/>\nthings they&#39;d learn in school laying around for them to pick up, or  <br/>\ntaking them to fun ways to learn about things they would have learned  <br/>\nthrough textbooks. Like leaving out books on butterflies and finding  <br/>\nprograms on Animal Planet for them that sound good for them and trips  <br/>\nto history museums. Of course when they don&#39;t embrace them with  <br/>\nenthusiasm we get worried!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be Sandra Dodd who often suggests asking yourself if it&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething you would do for a spouse or friend. If we see a book we  <br/>\nthink our spouse or a friend would really like, we might buy it or  <br/>\ntell them about it. We&#39;d recommend movies they might like. We might  <br/>\npoint out a lecture or something they might find interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same with kids. We aren&#39;t trying to fill gaps in our spouses  <br/>\nand friends. We&#39;re just passing on things they might like that they  <br/>\nmay not have heard of.<br/>\n<br/>\nWIth kids we just need to ramp it up. They aren&#39;t likely to be  <br/>\ncombing the paper, and stumbling across things that sound intriguing.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re less likely to get intrigued about something that might  <br/>\ninterest them if they just don&#39;t know enough about it. A kid won&#39;t  <br/>\nget all excited about a video about the Titanic if they don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhat the Titanic is!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might also be helpful to let go of any emotional investment you  <br/>\nmight have in something you put down for them. Treat everything you  <br/>\nstrew as<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a HUGE library of books in my house<br/>\n&gt; already, not text books naturally, but shelves of biographies,<br/>\n&gt; NUMEROUS&#39;fact&#39; type books about all sorts of things (science,<br/>\n&gt; history, animals etc), novels (classics and contemporary fiction)<br/>\n&gt; etc etc etc, and of course tons of childrens books... Is this enough<br/>\n&gt; to implement Unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I thought so. But honestly a lot of the books I bought have gone  <br/>\nunread. We read tons of picture books and it was great owning her  <br/>\nfavorites that were read over and over. But if I had to do it over  <br/>\nagain, I would cut way back on the books! (If I could ;-) They&#39;re  <br/>\nhard to resist!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in the end spending an afternoon doing crafts, or riding in  <br/>\nthe car talking, or going for a walk exploring, or playing a video  <br/>\ngame, or sharing a favorite cartoon together, is what&#39;s more  <br/>\nimportant. Making connections is more important than filling our  <br/>\nheads full of information.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re so conditioned in this society to think of books as the key to  <br/>\nknowledge that we unconsciously put everything else way down on the  <br/>\nlist. The truth is that books are just a convenient and cheap package  <br/>\nfor information and one person&#39;s ideas. There&#39;s nothing knowledge- <br/>\nwise more special about a book than a conversation or a movie or trip  <br/>\nto a pond. In fact, books are closer to school than to real life when  <br/>\nyou think about it. Books provide linear information the way schools  <br/>\ndo. Real life is about absorbing a 1000 different ideas and seeing  <br/>\nthe patterns and connections between them. That&#39;s the way we  <br/>\nnaturally learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn no way shape or form should someone see that as a dislike of  <br/>\nbooks. But it is putting books in a more realistic perspective. As  <br/>\nfar as learning goes books aren&#39;t more important or special than any  <br/>\nother form of linear information (like a video or a lecture). Their  <br/>\nimportance lies only in what someone is getting from them. Nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can it all be done with no &#39;traditional&#39;<br/>\n&gt; text books?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I could say &quot;Yes! Absolutely!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr I could confusingly say, &quot;It depends on the kid.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think it might be more telling to say there is no &quot;it&quot;. There  <br/>\nis no standard process that unschooling families are doing with their  <br/>\nkids. For curriculum users, the process looks the same with slight  <br/>\nvariations: kids at the kitchen table reading from textbooks. Maybe  <br/>\nthey might read their texts on the couch. Or really progressive  <br/>\ncurriculum users might let them do it on the floor! ;-) But really  <br/>\nthe process is the same. Even with eclectic homeschooling, all the  <br/>\nkids are doing something that looks like science or literature or math.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for unschoolers, unschooling looks like summer vacation with  <br/>\nparents who like to play too. :-) And, while *the philosophy* is the  <br/>\nsame for unschooling families, how  it&#39;s put into practice will look  <br/>\ntotally different. For some it might be a lot of going places. For  <br/>\nsome it might be a lot of classes (dance and art and so forth). For  <br/>\nsome it might be a lot of play dates. For some it might be a lot of  <br/>\ntelevision and video games. For most families it will probably look  <br/>\nlike a little of each of those.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really depends on what a child enjoys. Some kids like textbooks  <br/>\nand workbooks and might use them in a fairly standard way. For some  <br/>\nkids there&#39;s a certain satisfying sense of &quot;Here&#39;s a complete chunk  <br/>\nof knowledge with a distinct beginning, end and goal.&quot; But there&#39;s  <br/>\nnothing better about that than playing video games. What&#39;s important  <br/>\nis freely exploring the world in a way the child finds fun and  <br/>\nsatisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a quick answer to your question is, there&#39;s no need to make (or  <br/>\ncajole or bribe or whatever) a child [to] use a textbook for them to  <br/>\nexplore life and find the things they enjoy before they&#39;re ready to  <br/>\nmove on in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Any advice or information would be most appriciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s years worth of collected posts in nice neat categories at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/\">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171724177,"authorName":"Kelly Weyd","from":"Kelly Weyd &lt;kellmar98@...&gt;","profile":"kellmar98","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling, but excited to start!","postDate":"1163676130","msgId":18955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5NjQ4NS4xMjQyMS5xbUB3ZWIzMTQxMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVqZmg3NStjcnMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18948,"nextInTopic":18956,"prevInTime":18954,"nextInTime":18956,"topicId":18935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heather, I am also new to Unschooling.

Those of you with experience in Unschooling, have you been <br/>\nsuccesful in just letting your children take the lead and let you <br/>\nknow what they want to learn? Do you &#39;create interest&#39; by just <br/>\nputting out the books and materials and letting them pursue what <br/>\ninterests them from that? I have a HUGE library of books in my house <br/>\nalready, not text books naturally, but shelves of biographies, <br/>\nNUMEROUS&#39;fact&#39; type books about all sorts of things (science, <br/>\nhistory, animals etc), novels (classics and contemporary fiction) <br/>\netc etc etc, and of course tons of childrens books... Is this enough <br/>\nto implement Unschooling? Can it all be done with no &#39;traditional&#39; <br/>\ntext books? Sorry for all the questions, but I am a novice and new <br/>\nto this whole concept. I suspect I&#39;ve been &#39;unschooling&#39; my children <br/>\nall along, just by answering their questions when asked, providing <br/>\nthought stimulating TV shows, music and toys... Is there more to it <br/>\nthan that? Any advice or information would be most appriciated. <br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nHeather<br/>\nMom of Vito and Lilly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19019,"nextTopicId":19009}}
