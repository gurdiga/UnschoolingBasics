It&#39;s a human invention, and in the wonderful <br/>\n  world of childhood, it&#39;s all but irrelevant. Because unschooling is <br/>\n  totally about trust, can you develop trust that your daughter will <br/>\n  learn about time from living through time? For my now-11-year-old <br/>\n  son, the concept of time was not relevant until he wanted to know <br/>\n  what time it was so he wouldn&#39;t miss a particular TV show he was <br/>\n  interested in or if there was someplace we had to be that he was very <br/>\n  interested in. But, as a younger kid, (maybe 7 or 8 and younger) he <br/>\n  came up with a great term (which he doesn&#39;t use anymore :-( <br/>\n  ): &quot;Nexterday.&quot; He had absolutely *no* concept of time, and it <br/>\n  didn&#39;t bother him (or me) at all! What did he need time for <br/>\n  anyway?! I knew that when it became important in his life, that <br/>\n  would be the time when he would gain the understanding of it. And he <br/>\n  has! Here&#39;s a great example:<br/>\n<br/>\n  I use a 24-hour clock on my computer because of the work I do. One <br/>\n  day when he was about 10 years old he said to me: &quot;Oh! I get <br/>\n  it! If you subtract 12 from that number, you&#39;ll get what the time <br/>\n  is!&quot; My computer clock at the time said it was 20:15. He figured <br/>\n  out that it was actually 8:15 p.m. I had never even explained it to <br/>\n  him!!! He just puzzled it out (for who knows how long!) and came to <br/>\n  that understanding entirely on his own! Perhaps, if I had labored to <br/>\n  explain it to him, he still might not grasp it (it certainly took me <br/>\n  a lot longer than that to understand the 24-hour clock!).<br/>\n<br/>\n  Reading an analog clock can be very tricky for kids, but I remember <br/>\n  when he puzzled that out, too! We had gotten him a big wall clock <br/>\n  without a battery in it and didn&#39;t mount it on the wall so he could <br/>\n  play with it. Or not. Totally up to him. But, he did play with it <br/>\n  &#39;cause *he* wanted to, and he eventually figured out what it all <br/>\n  meant. It&#39;s his preference to use a digital clock, but his <br/>\n  understanding of the way an analog clock works (which is a graphic <br/>\n  demonstration of how time moves) is his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you&#39;re willing to embrace unschooling, try to let go of the idea <br/>\n  that you have to &quot;teach&quot; her anything about time! Time is swirling <br/>\n  around her always, and she&#39;ll grasp it when *she* needs to ~~ and/or <br/>\n  she&#39;ll ask for your help. Give her your help freely and watch what happens!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 16:34 10/2/2006, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;I am new to unschooling and did start the year with some BJU reading <br/>\n  &gt;and english but have been teaching my 7 yo who is very interested in <br/>\n  &gt;cooking but has yet to master telling time ...<br/>\n<br/>\n  _.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._<br/>\n<br/>\n  Marji<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gaiawolf.org/\">http://www.gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/GaiaWolf/\">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/GaiaWolf/</a>&gt;Join the GaiaWolf Mailing List<br/>\n  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/gaiawolf\">http://myspace.com/gaiawolf</a>&gt;Visit us on MySpace<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The animals of this world exist for their own reasons.

I don&#39;t  <br/>\neven use it when I cook. I will say that seven is young for telling  <br/>\ntime beyond hour and half hour. Most cooks I know don&#39;t use clocks  <br/>\nper se, but timers (which I don&#39;t use either, I&#39;m rather the kind to  <br/>\npull it out when it looks done or smells too good to wait any longer)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my kids, I think they&#39;ve just picked it up over time when I&#39;ve  <br/>\nsaid, we&#39;ll need to leave at 6:30 to get there on time, and then they  <br/>\nwatch the clock. Or if a friend is coming over they ask over and over  <br/>\n&quot;What time is it?&quot; At that point it&#39;s important to them to know time.  <br/>\nRachel just asked for a new watch. She can&#39;t tell time, but it was  <br/>\nimportant to her. My mom told me when I was about her age, I could  <br/>\nhave one AFTER I learned to tell time. All that did was break my  <br/>\nheart.

Because unschooling is ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-13927668\">Hi, GracieAnn,<br/>\n<br/>\nTime is a funny thing.  It&#39;s a human invention, and in the wonderful <br/>\nworld of childhood, it&#39;s all but irrelevant.  Because unschooling is <br/>\ntotally about trust, can you develop trust that your daughter will <br/>\nlearn about time from living through time?  For my now-11-year-old <br/>\nson, the concept of time was not relevant until he wanted to know <br/>\nwhat time it was so he wouldn&#39;t miss a particular TV show he was <br/>\ninterested in or if there was someplace we had to be that he was very <br/>\ninterested in.  But, as a younger kid, (maybe 7 or 8 and younger) he <br/>\ncame up with a great term (which he doesn&#39;t use anymore :-( <br/>\n):  &quot;Nexterday.&quot;  He had absolutely *no* concept of time, and it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t bother him (or me) at all!  What did he need time for <br/>\nanyway?!  I knew that when it became important in his life, that <br/>\nwould be the time when he would gain the understanding of it.  And he <br/>\nhas!  Here&#39;s a great example:<br/>\n<br/>\nI use a 24-hour clock on my computer because of the work I do.  One <br/>\nday when he was about 10 years old he said to me:  &quot;Oh!  I get <br/>\nit!  If you subtract 12 from that number, you&#39;ll get what the time <br/>\nis!&quot;  My computer clock at the time said it was 20:15.  He figured <br/>\nout that it was actually 8:15 p.m.  I had never even explained it to <br/>\nhim!!!  He just puzzled it out (for who knows how long!) and came to <br/>\nthat understanding entirely on his own!  Perhaps, if I had labored to <br/>\nexplain it to him, he still might not grasp it (it certainly took me <br/>\na lot longer than that to understand the 24-hour clock!).<br/>\n<br/>\nReading an analog clock can be very tricky for kids, but I remember <br/>\nwhen he puzzled that out, too!  We had gotten him a big wall clock <br/>\nwithout a battery in it and didn&#39;t mount it on the wall so he could <br/>\nplay with it.  Or not.  Totally up to him.  But, he did play with it <br/>\n&#39;cause *he* wanted to, and he eventually figured out what it all <br/>\nmeant.  It&#39;s his preference to use a digital clock, but his <br/>\nunderstanding of the way an analog clock works (which is a graphic <br/>\ndemonstration of how time moves) is his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re willing to embrace unschooling, try to let go of the idea <br/>\nthat you have to &quot;teach&quot; her anything about time!  Time is swirling <br/>\naround her always, and she&#39;ll grasp it when *she* needs to ~~ and/or <br/>\nshe&#39;ll ask for your help.  Give her your help freely and watch what happens!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 16:34 10/2/2006, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am new to unschooling and did start the year with some BJU reading <br/>\n&gt;and english but have been teaching my 7 yo who is very interested in <br/>\n&gt;cooking but has yet to master telling time ...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._.:~`^&#39;~:._<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gaiawolf.org/\">http://www.gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/GaiaWolf/\">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/GaiaWolf/</a>&gt;Join the GaiaWolf Mailing List<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/gaiawolf\">http://myspace.com/gaiawolf</a>&gt;Visit us on MySpace<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The animals of this world exist for their own reasons.
