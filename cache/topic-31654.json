How can I<br/>\nstill keep the unschooling way and conform to the necessary<br/>\nrequirements?~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it helpful to think about &quot;how can I make the requirements<br/>\nconform to our life?&quot; rather than how to make our lives conform to the<br/>\nrequirements. We have it super-easy in NC, we have to keep attendance<br/>\nand test once a year, but the test is for our records only; there&#39;s no<br/>\ngrade they have to achieve or anything. I could have taken this VERY<br/>\nseriously, and had my kids prepare for the test in as unschooly a way<br/>\nas I could think of - and instead, the test is NO big deal. I don&#39;t<br/>\nuse the suggested timer, and I help when they ask. It&#39;s one more piece<br/>\nof paperwork we have to do to homeschool legally here, so we&#39;ll jump<br/>\nthrough that hoop. Valerie Fitzenreiter, author of The Unprocessed<br/>\nChild, came to speak at an unschooling conference here, and she said<br/>\nshe would have taken the test for her daughter!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, live your life as joyfully as you&#39;re able, take lots of pictures -<br/>\nplaying outside? Nature, science, math, english if you talk at all.<br/>\nDramatic play? English, and depending on her characters, history,<br/>\nempathy, nurturing... the possibilities are endless!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t see where science lab reports were required... especially for<br/>\na five year old! ;) Just live each day as it comes, they are each<br/>\nprecious.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Trying to wrap my brain around this.","postDate":"1207620032","msgId":31656,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ0ZWprMCtuamNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ0ZTNibSthM2V2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31654,"nextInTopic":31662,"prevInTime":31655,"nextInTime":31657,"topicId":31654,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I live in WV and we are required to have our home ... and approval.~~ I looked at the laws for WV breifly and it looks pretty dang easy.
