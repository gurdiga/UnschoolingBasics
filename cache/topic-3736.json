Can you <br/>\nwrite down some math puzzles for me?&quot;  Duh, hello! Natural desire right <br/>\nthere, and he&#39;s sitting there telling me it&#39;s impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns into he&#39;s not worried about her math &quot;now&quot; but he is worried that <br/>\nshe&#39;s not reading. Grrrrr......<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out the same thing that makes me confident makes him crazy: we <br/>\nboth know she *can* read, but is choosing not to. I know that she&#39;s <br/>\nsmart and curious and that when she&#39;s ready to do it, she will and no <br/>\namount of pushing is going to change that. He actually had the nerve to <br/>\nuse the word &quot;lazy&quot; last night, then claims he only said it because I <br/>\nbacked him into a corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh, I&#39;m mad.
