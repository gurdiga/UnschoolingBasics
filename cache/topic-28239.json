I figure there will come a day. He has had friends over who are quite interested in naked women. And Linnaea, who is 7, has played Barbie doll games that have some adult scenes going on, and has worked really hard to get her Sims to &quot;woohoo&quot; on the Sims2. Oh, and we have Leisure Suit Larry for the PS2, which they haven&#39;t played for ages, but which was sort of fun for a little while. Sex and sexual imagery just isn&#39;t quite fascinating, yet. <br/>\n <br/>\nI would be most worried about the computer being vulnerable to trojans &lt;BWG&gt;  and other sorts of computer STD&#39;s that might be an issue than I would be about the exposure to naked folk. I&#39;d make sure I had really good firewalls and up to date virus software. From my teen years I have some pretty sexually explicit comic books, and some nice books of nudes, I might hunt through all the boxes from move after move and see if I could put my hands on those. I don&#39;t know that I would make a big deal out of it, but I&#39;d probably put them somewhere that I know he&#39;d see them and I wouldn&#39;t mention it. I would talk to him about Chris Langham and the trouble he got into for downloading images of children to his computer and how there are images that are available via the internet that could get him into seriously hot water. He needs to tread carefully if accessing nudity via the internet. That&#39;s what I would point out. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Momma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:southernbelle@...\">southernbelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 5 December, 2007 2:19:03 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Kids & Porn<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you all handle finding out that your 11 year old son was looking at porn on the intenet? <br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266096457,"authorName":"momma","from":"&quot;momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt;","profile":"centurykissed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Kids & Porn","postDate":"1196867034","msgId":28240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZqNmVrcSs1bzhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28239,"nextInTopic":28241,"prevInTime":28239,"nextInTime":28241,"topicId":28239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How would you all handle finding out that your 11 year old son was looking at porn on the intenet?
