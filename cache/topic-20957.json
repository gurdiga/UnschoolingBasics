So  I&#39;m a <br/>\nbig fan of marriage for a lot of reasons, including health insurance. But  I&#39;m <br/>\nnot more committed to Beth than I was before we could get married legally.  <br/>\n(I say legally because we&#39;d gotten married two times before -- first, in a holy <br/>\n union in our church, then a civil union in Vermont.) <br/>\n <br/>\nThat said, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d consider moving to a place where we wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nbe married, which lets out the rest of the US.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other thing about young marriage. Julian is in a relationship with  <br/>\nanother unschooler, who he met at conferences and lives in Arkansas. She&#39;s a few  <br/>\nyears younger than him and she&#39;s very far away. But I could see them ending up  <br/>\ntogether permanently. They come from families with similar values and ideas  <br/>\nabout parenting. They have similar temperaments -- both are calm, sweet, <br/>\ngentle  people. They are incredibly kind to each other.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would hope that they wait a long time before making a permanent  <br/>\ncommittment, because I think they both should have a chance to be kids as long  as they <br/>\ncan and want to.  But I really respect their relationship.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20802,"nextTopicId":20995}}
