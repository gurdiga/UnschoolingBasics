About our plan to take Eva to 1st grade and not to unschool the whole way. I would absolutely love to try unschooling her, but there&#39;re a couple of complications. My husband is not on the same page with me. He&#39;s fine with skipping the K year, but at this point he wouldn&#39;t agree with me about unschooling her all the way. Second is that I&#39;ll need (and want) to start working in a couple of years. I may be able to come up with a plan when I can have my own schedule and so can be with the kids as well, but so far this is all unclear. Living on one paycheck may not be an option for us. Besides, I thought we&#39;d possible try both and see what Eva prefers--that&#39;s why the plan is provisional.<br/>\nI have a friend whole son skipped kindergarten and went straight to 1st grade, and that really worked for them. I realize that all kids are different, and right now it&#39;s hard to predict how it will turn out with Eva. I get a sense from all the comments that many people don&#39;t think skipping K is a good idea...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the public school in our neighborhood, I thought about it for a while and actually came to the point where I was OK with Eva going to what I thought was our school and checking it out. Then, just a little while ago I realized that our side of the street goes to a different one, and that one may actually be a little unsafe. Maybe not so much the school--which actually could be the worst in our part of town--as the immediate neighborhood, which is definitely the worst around us. Besides the safety concerns, I think it would not be fair to take my daughter there to let her decide whether she wants to go to school. That wouldn&#39;t be much of a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we&#39;re moving and hopefully she&#39;s going to a decent school, and we&#39;ll go from there. I may also try to have her do half a day. It appears that we have a right to ask for it in IL, but from what I know I would have to negotiate that with the principal.<br/>\n<br/>\nyulia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lindaguitar&quot; &lt;lindaguitar@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yulia,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also feel that kids should have lots of time to run around and play outside (and indoors); basically, kids need to be allowed time to play! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Having unschooled my kids, I really did enjoy spending lots of time with them as they grew up!   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After reading what you wrote about this decision, and what others wrote back, it seems to me that one possible solution might be for you to enroll your daughter in kindergarten in the fall, but let her know what homeschooling IS (you don&#39;t have to try to explain unschooling, just let her know that there are lots of kids who learn at home instead of going to school, and that it&#39;s one of many acceptable choices for families), and tell her that if she ever decides that she would rather be homeschooled and not go to school anymore, she should let you know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She might decide that she doesn&#39;t like school after just a few days!

She got to experience the good parts, and the parts she was curious about. When the bad parts outweighed the good, she was able to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think many people, without realizing it, get the feeling that their kids have somehow absorbed why unschooling is so much better than school from our own experiences with school. But they haven&#39;t, of course. If they&#39;ve always unschooled, they can only speak with authority about their unschooling experience and only theoretically about school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting everyone send their kids to school to get that hands on knowledge of school! ;-) But if a child wants to try, the point of unschooling is that kids learn best through experience. We can&#39;t&#39; pour in our knowledge of school any more than school can pour in knowledge of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the other hand, if your daughter starts kindergarten and LIKES it, <br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t need to worry that she will forget her Russian.

While parents can create the environment that would support a child being bilingual, not all kids in that environment will be. Some kids have a greater facility for language and will effortlessly move from one language to another. Others are not as verbal so trying to express themselves in one language is hard enough for them.

However, I do feel there are reasons to hold her for K, the most important one being that she&#39;ll be more mature in a year. I do agree that school can be a good experience but I don&#39;t think that waiting a year necessarily means creating problems. Some problems can be seen as positive challenges. We are immigrants and we have lots of immigrant friends. Based on our experience, I would say that getting adjusted to a new situation can be hard but it can also be enriching. Besides, I think with our support it could be a challenge that would involve learning and maturing for our daughter. I remember reading a fascinating article by a New York Times correspondent in Moscow, who brought his three school-age children from the US to Moscow, and they ended up attending a Russian school for 4 years. They all went through hard times (the kindergartner actually had it the easiest), but in the end the experience they had was invaluable. We&#39;re of course not in the same situation, but it&#39;s really going to be a lot easier for our daughter than for those American kids in Moscowshe has been around English speaking people since she was born. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that skipping K for the sake of strengthening her Russian language skills is not a silly whim. Most immigrant children, with the exclusion perhaps of those who speak Spanish, lose their family language very quickly after they start schoolwe&#39;ve definitely seen it among Russian families. I believe that being bilingual is a huge advantage. Besides, I&#39;d make sure she spends time with English speaking kids if she decides to stay home. Linguistic and cultural isolation is definitely not my plan for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut yes, you are right that I should support her interests and her decision.

Admittedly, she may not find it painful at all.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  When I ask her why she wants to go to school, she says because she wants to learn what the teachers will teach her. I wouldn&#39;t say she enjoys structured &quot;lessons&quot; at home. She has little patience with it and tries to take over. For example, she sometimes prefers to read words her own way, or when she writes something (when SHE wants to write something, without me suggesting it to her), she may ask for my help but for very limited help--she doesn&#39;t want me to spell out the whole word for her, just one small part of the word. I usually don&#39;t interfere with her writing because most of the time she doesn&#39;t like it. She just recently took a liking for playing &quot;school&quot; with me, but she prefers to set the terms for the game even when she tells me I&#39;ll be the teacher. So, I guess she like the idea of school, but she doesn&#39;t enjoy becoming a &quot;receptacle&quot; for at least my teaching. I do admit though that if she likes her teacher she may enjoy learning from him or her. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; As for her language, it&#39;s an interesting issue. She&#39;s a very sociable and articulate child, and when she started preschool last year we thought she&#39;d pick up English very fast--we were just hoping she wouldn&#39;t want to switch to it too soon. It didn&#39;t happen the way we expected. On the one hand, she picked up enough English to communicate with the kids and the teachers, and she seems to be very confident about talking to people in English. However, I would say that her English is weaker than we thought it would be after almost 2 years of preschool. For a while her interest in English was markedly limited--for example, she wouldn&#39;t have us read English books to her. It has recently started changing: once in a while she would even start speaking English to us at home. Her pattern of acquiring English is quite different from that of a Korean boy in her preschool class. He speaks English as a native speaker, and I was very surprised to find out that he was born in Korea and has been living in the US for 2,5 years at most. He speaks Korean at home and is also very much attached to his grandma who lives in Korea and talks to him on Skype every day. I&#39;m not saying that he&#39;s more talented in languages than my daughter, but it&#39;s really amazing how different kids are. My daughter&#39;s Russian has been very rich and really wonderful for a while by now, and maybe it&#39;s because she has felt so at home speaking it  that she has stuck to it so persistently for so long. In other words, she&#39;s very verbal and maybe because she has known Russian so much better than English, it offers much more room for her verbal imagination? All of this doesn&#39;t at all make me think she&#39;s going to have problems with English. I think her English is going to be just as great at her Russian, and I don&#39;t understand why they have ESL classes for kindergartners. That&#39;s another thing that seems to be quite wrong in our public schools. I think her Russian knowledge is actually going to enrich her English, especially if she&#39;s not pushed in her English acquisition. So, when it comes to going to school this year, I&#39;m not worried about her English, but I am a bit worried about her giving up on her Russian. I thought one more year at home would give us more chances to strengthen her Russian. Do you think I&#39;m preparing her for a rough entry when I bring her to 1st grade?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I am of course planning to find socializing opportunities for her in case she stays home. It&#39;s true, I will have my hands full with the baby, but the &quot;new house&quot; is very likely to be simply a 2-bedroom apartment, so that shouldn&#39;t be a big deal especially if I take it slowly.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; In any case, I guess, what I&#39;m going to do is take her to school when it starts and let her know that she can stay home if she wants to.

What does she like about preschool and imagine she&#39;ll like about school? Look for ways to give her more of those things. If her big interest is friends, be sure to find lots of ways for her to meet and hang out with other kids - play dates and outings where she can meet people of all ages.

Life was crazy and the next thing I knew my 2nd daughter was in school ... half way through my 2nd daughters first grade I came to my senses and realized we had a different plan. Having said all that I am glad that they had the experience of going to school but part of me wishes I had not sent them at all ... there are still things that we have to unlearn from that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck your state laws ... where we are from children can start Kindergarten as late as 6 years old. So maybe you could wait another year without making this decision OR some states Kindergarten is not required, again you could wait another year and see where it takes you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that your reasons for homeschooling are very valid and even though you say it is minor, being bilingual is a HUGE gift to anyone. And I think that is a valid reason to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI now have 6 children and have been homeschooling for over 10 years ... my younger children have never been to school and yes there are times when they wonder what it is like and have friends who talk about it but with a little time they realize that we do so many great things that they would never have the time to do if they were in school all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just my opinion but public school is not a right of passage or something that children have to do ... you as a parent have the right to make choices that you feel are best for your child ... what doctors they see, etc... education is just as important in my opinion and yes you have the right to make this decision for your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you much luck ... parenting can be hard but it sounds like you have some great thoughts going on and I hope it all works well for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace, love and kindness, Amy<br/>\n<br/>\n--</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"Alex Polikowsy","from":"Alex Polikowsy &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: trying to make a decision about unschooling","postDate":"1331829322","msgId":48059,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwODdEOTE5LTM3NjUtNDUzQS04RTU0LThDQUY5REQwMEFBNEB5YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGpqdDNwbytpczFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpqdDNwbytpczFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48058,"nextInTopic":48060,"prevInTime":48058,"nextInTime":48060,"topicId":48048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are  many schools that will let a homeschool kid come for a day Sent from my iPhone ...

The closer we get there, the more attracted I become to the idea of unschooling her, at least","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-740494820\">Hi all,<br/>\nmy daughter is supposed to start Kindergarten this fall. The closer we get there, the more attracted I become to the idea of unschooling her, at least for the kindergarten year. here are a few reasons why I&#39;d like unschooling:<br/>\n1. I think a 5-year-old needs to be out playing as much as possible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very healthy for a 5-year-old to be stuck inside most of the day every day within a structured environment. I want her to be free a bit longer.<br/>\n2. I was not unschooled, but the most meaningful things I learned were outside of school and in a way in spite of school.  I did go to a pretty crappy school, though.<br/>\n3. I want to be able to hang out with my daughter, do interesting things with her. I&#39;m afraid that if she starts school, she&#39;d be so exhausted that I would just want to let her rest for the rest of the day. Besides, there&#39;ll be just too little time to go places and do things. (I&#39;m expecting a baby this summer, so it may not be very easy to care for the baby and at the same time provide for my daughter&#39;s social and intellectual needs, but I feel that if she&#39;s not at school, I&#39;ll also get to earn a lot instead of just living a &quot;bodily&quot; life of a baby&#39;s mother.)<br/>\n4. (a somewhat minor reason): We speak Russian at home, and keeping her home for one more year maybe will strengthen her Russian even further, as we&#39;re hoping she&#39;ll grow up truly bilingual--something that often doesn&#39;t work out once kids start going to school.<br/>\n5. (another minor reason): Her going to Kindergarten would mean that we&#39;d have to move from our current neighborhood. We&#39;re not against moving, but it would mean much higher rent and other living expenses for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I have a few reasons that make me doubt whether unschooling would be the right move. Here they are:<br/>\n1. My daughter is in preschool right now (a play-based one, a couple of hours 4 times a week) and she wants to go to the &quot;big school&quot; in the fall because she know everybody is going. I don&#39;t want her to feel like I&#39;m forcing her to stay home. I think that&#39;s my biggest worry about keeping her home. She may feel left out.<br/>\n2. She&#39;s a Russian speaker, and her English, although very functional, is quite broken. My husband thinks that by keeping her home an extra year we may harm her because she&#39;d be so much behind when and if she goes to 1 st grade after skipping Kindergarten. I am planning to hire a nanny whose primary role would be being an English speaking friend to my daughter, but this may still not bring her to the level she would probably be after going to school for a year. I am not at all worried about her English--there&#39;s no way she won&#39;t be able to speak it growing up. I am however worried about her school testing her and tracking her and making the whole thing stressful to all of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I&#39;m trying to make a decision, we&#39;re also looking at places to move to (the nearest suburb), and so far we&#39;ve found nothing that would work for us. We could of course just stay where we&#39;re at and take her to a neighborhood school here, but city schools I think are even tougher on the kids--no real recess, almost no PE classes, longer school days... I don&#39;t want her to go away for a whole day and come back exhausted... Maybe she&#39;ll be fine and I just need to give it a try? And just keep the possibility to not go to school always open for her?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this list, but I&#39;ve already learned quite a few things from it. As I&#39;m sorting this out for myself, II would greatly appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nYulia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48076,"nextTopicId":48078}}
