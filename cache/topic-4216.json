But that&#39;s only one of the benefits of<br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n***The parent that shields their child from all hurt feelings is NOT<br/>\npreparing them for life outside the unschooling family/society.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not possible for a parent to shield a child from all hurts.  Every<br/>\nperson will experience hurt feelings.   It&#39;s not the goal of unschooling<br/>\nparents to shield their children from life experiences.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut school and school dynamics is not real life.  School is an artificial<br/>\nenvironment that designs it&#39;s own arbitrary problems for children to<br/>\nsolve (in one right/acceptable way)  under the watchful eye of a judge<br/>\nwho then decide whether that child is good enough to move forward.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo while an unschooling parent won&#39;t and can&#39;t shield her child from the<br/>\nnatural course of life&#39;s hurts she can shield her child from the<br/>\nunnatural injuries caused by the unnatural conditions of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son might get hurt if he rides his bike, but I don&#39;t have to flatten<br/>\nhis tires and loosen his chain in order to make sure he experiences the<br/>\nwhole realm of possibilities while riding.   In fact, I always tried to<br/>\nmake sure his bike was in good working condition so that he could avoid<br/>\nunnecessary hurts.   School and grades and everything about the system is<br/>\nan unnecessary hurt. <br/>\n<br/>\n***We have no intention of grading our daughter. My question of &quot;grade&quot;<br/>\nmeant grade level. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you meant but there is no difference.  Being in third grade<br/>\nmeans you are better (more than) second grade and not as good as (less<br/>\nthan) fourth grade.  It is very difficult for those grade levels not to<br/>\ntranslate as personal assessment.  Do you believe kids *don&#39;t* take it<br/>\npersonally?   They do.  Kids who are held back are ashamed and<br/>\nembarrassed.  Kids who jump &quot;ahead&quot; are proud and important and under<br/>\npresser now to stay &quot;ahead.&quot;  <br/>\nWhen people have asked Dylan (twelve years old) what grade he&#39;s in he<br/>\nsimply says &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  If they persist he tells them he is<br/>\nphilosophically opposed to assigning grades to personal learning.    <br/>\n<br/>\nJust because society might expect the standard answer from your daughter<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the right answer.  It doesn&#39;t mean they have a right to<br/>\nexpect it.  Conformity is not a goal of unschooling, does not always make<br/>\nlife easier or better and does not contribute positively to personal<br/>\ngrowth.   <br/>\n<br/>\n ***However, if &quot;unschooling&quot; means never comparing, never competing,<br/>\nnever striving, never having your feelings hurt, and always living apart<br/>\nfor the rest of society, then maybe unschooling is NOT for us.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is dramatic and not well thought out.  A healthy person could not<br/>\nlive and never strive for what he wanted.   Nor would he choose to live a<br/>\nlife apart from society forever, without a very good reason for doing so.<br/>\n   Unschooling can&#39;t mean any of those things because those things are<br/>\nimpossible. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to comparison and competition the difference between those things in<br/>\nschool or out is choice and control. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool in compulsory - a child has no choice about being there and is not<br/>\nin control of what happens there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA child in school has no choice about being compared to every other child<br/>\nin the nation in that grade level.  She is measured and graded at every<br/>\nstage through no choice of her own and cannot choose by what means she is<br/>\nmeasured.  Through tests she is forced into competition with others in<br/>\nher grade level all over the world.  She cannot choose to opt out of<br/>\ntesting.  If she does well in competition she&#39;s rewarded with good grades<br/>\nand special classes and can move forward to the next grade.  If she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t compete well she&#39;s punished with bad grades,  special ed and<br/>\nbeing held back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA person in the real world can choose to put himself in competition with<br/>\nothers.  My son can choose to compare himself with others and he has a<br/>\nchoice with what to do with his findings.  If he finds himself lacking in<br/>\nsome skill it is not stored in a file and pulled later as a statistic in<br/>\norder to determine how to treat others of similar skill level.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe can choose to compete with others or he can opt out of competitions.  <br/>\nIf he knows he can&#39;t do a thing he can say so.  He won&#39;t get an F.  He<br/>\nwill have another chance another day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Deb. I really hope you can understand where I am coming from.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI do.  I can.  My own baby was new twelve years ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nI can&#39;t come to your house and force you into some unschooling model I&#39;ve<br/>\nset for everyone.  You are free to live life as you choose and you can<br/>\ndecide how you&#39;re going to live with your daughter.  All I can do is<br/>\nshare my experience as an unschooling parent.  My son is twelve.  He&#39;s<br/>\nnever been to school.  He lives life in the real world and is learning<br/>\nall the time.   I can tell you how he learned to read without lessons.  I<br/>\ncan tell you how he learned to count money and make change without math<br/>\nworksheets.  I can tell you how he learned about dinosaurs and the chaos<br/>\ntheory without science class and text books.  I can tell you how he<br/>\nhandled Tae Kwon Do competitions and belt tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to be willing to reexamine what you think you know about<br/>\nlearning if you want to understand unschooling.&lt;g&gt;   Life can be lived<br/>\nwithout school and without bringing school&#39;s altered reality and the<br/>\ndamage it causes into your daughter&#39;s life.   That part is up to you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not concerned with my son&#39;s education at all.  I can say that fairly<br/>\nshocking thing because I&#39;ve lived with him long enough to understand he&#39;s<br/>\nlearning all the time.  It&#39;s an unstoppable force and there is *no way*<br/>\nhe&#39;ll come to the end of his life and think of himself as &quot;uneducated.&quot;  <br/>\nNo one he knows thinks of him as &quot;uneducated.&quot;   He doesn&#39;t believe there<br/>\nis a condition called &quot;uneducated&quot;.  He only knows there will always be<br/>\nnew things to discover about the world and about himself.  He knows he&#39;s<br/>\ncapable of learning anything he wants to learn and he knows he can learn<br/>\nat any time.  He has twelve years of experience as proof. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie with a relatively clean slate","postDate":"1102439684","msgId":4244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjA3MTcxNDQ0LjQ0NDM3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDI4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjA3MTM1MjQ0LjQ0MDA3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjYxMjA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4243,"nextInTopic":4245,"prevInTime":4243,"nextInTime":4245,"topicId":4216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Comparisons hurt. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, comparisons CAN hurt. That is one of the reasons that we are considering the unschooling method. However, there are alot more &quot;schoolers&quot; than there are unschoolers - and comparisons of relative relative value/achievement take place all the time out in the wider society. Scouting, Church activities, College admissions, employment, etc. ALL have achievement requirements/goals. Unless our daughter plans to spend the rest of her life out in the Montana badlands, comparisons and achievements and attaining goals will come up; very likely often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO, the REAL trick is to let the kids determine their own path without undue pressure, and allow them to learn life&#39;s lessons at their own pace.

It&#39;s really <br/>\nweird to have a 2y.o. reading over your shoulder while you&#39;re on the <br/>\ncomputer, let me tell you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, but the important point I wanted to make is that unschooling is <br/>\nnot result oriented. Millie&#39;s child reads at 2. I have a child that <br/>\nis really a beginning reader for all intents and purposes, at the <br/>\nage of 11. It&#39;s all good.<br/>\nWhether your child does things &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; according to the <br/>\nschool system, it doesn&#39;t matter to unschoolers. What matters is a <br/>\nlife of joy, pursuing that which we love.<br/>\nSome kids will do things that society worships (like reading) at <br/>\nvery young ages, others will not. What I love about these unschooled <br/>\nminds, is that they don&#39;t have to be labeled, graded or compared to <br/>\nother people. They can SHINE (Anne Ohman&#39;s term) for who they are, <br/>\nright now, today.<br/>\nWhat a beautiful gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure you already realized this Jeff, but I just didn&#39;t want a <br/>\nnewbie thinking that kids will start reading at 2 or 3 just because <br/>\nthey&#39;re &quot;unschoolers&quot; (in reality, they&#39;re just being toddlers at <br/>\nthat age). It&#39;s about your precious child being who she is, and all <br/>\nof you discovering new things together.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Newbie with a relatively clean slate","postDate":"1102287701","msgId":4216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNwMDQwbCt0anZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4217,"prevInTime":4215,"nextInTime":4217,"topicId":4216,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic achievement?
