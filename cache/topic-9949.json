I say that ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-195846817\">Well, at least we are all in the same boat! HAHA  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have done is incorporate a little Charlotte<br/>\nMason with unschooling philosophies.  I say that<br/>\nbecause we aren&#39;t doing everything that was done by<br/>\nCharlotte Mason, many of our &quot;lessons&quot; are way under<br/>\nthe 20 minutes that she uses.  My son is not<br/>\ninterested in art and who did it, nor in classical<br/>\nmusic along with the composers, etc. This is one way<br/>\nin which we incorporate the unschooling philosphies.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are things that we have been doing and nothing is<br/>\nset in stone...<br/>\n<br/>\nGarfields Typing Tutor - at most takes 2-3 minutes a<br/>\nday...sometimes they stay on longer just to play the<br/>\nfun games.  The game will not let you move on until<br/>\nyou score well enough in each learning segment.  I<br/>\nthink my 8yo has only been held up once but I find<br/>\nthat they both enjoy trying to improve their scores. <br/>\nZak and Brooke want to learn this because they IM with<br/>\nGrandparents and like to write emails, they see this<br/>\nas beneficial.  DH loves this being incorporated as<br/>\nwell<br/>\n<br/>\nGarfield quiz game online-My kids discovered this<br/>\nlittle gem and they play it just about everyday!  You<br/>\nplay with others in the online community.  They are<br/>\nlearning a lot of &quot;quiz&quot; questions from history and<br/>\nscience to pop culture and geography and everything in<br/>\nbetween.  DH, sees this as beneficial for fact<br/>\nknowledge.  The children find it just plain fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Vocab enhancement I put a greek or latin root word<br/>\n next to our calendar and there is no set time to<br/>\n&quot;learn&quot; the words.  For instance, last week I put up<br/>\n&quot;Tele&quot; then all the definitions on the rest of the<br/>\nsheet are vocabulary words with the root &quot;tele&quot;.  You<br/>\ncan even make up your own words with the root words so<br/>\nit&#39;s fun. Brooke makes up little songs on paper (which<br/>\nshe thought up on her own) and sings them to me<br/>\nthroughout the week.  :-)  DH LOVES this because<br/>\nknowing root words helps people decipher new<br/>\nvocabulary.  It does not have to be blood sweat and<br/>\ntears though.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak is reading the last Harry Potter book and Brooke<br/>\nis reading &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; ~ They love their<br/>\nbooks.  Brooke just finished &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; a<br/>\ncouple of weeks ago, she couldn&#39;t put it down.  What a<br/>\ndelightful and fun story.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory is a combination of tv and reading.  I mean,<br/>\nyou cannot escape it but for DH&#39;s sake we &quot;do&quot;<br/>\nhistory.  We just finished &quot;The Golden Goblet&quot; and my<br/>\nds did a written narration.  I did not make him write<br/>\nit in one day, just asked for a little writing each<br/>\nday.  DD only did oral narrations.  They loved the<br/>\nstory, it&#39;s historical fiction.  We only read a little<br/>\neach day, it was fun because each day we&#39;d wake up and<br/>\nspend some time with Ranofer - the main character.  It<br/>\ntook us about 1-2 months to finish this book but we<br/>\nALL got so much out of it.  We are now reading<br/>\n&quot;D&#39;Aulaires Book of Greek Myths&quot;, we are LOVING IT!!! <br/>\nThe children are starting to see a connection with 12,<br/>\nstarting to connect how one myth may change places and<br/>\nnames of gods/goddesses/god but is basically the same<br/>\n&quot;thought&quot;.  It was so COOL at the Zoo yesterday for<br/>\nthem to look at the peacock and know the greek myth<br/>\nbehind the &quot;eyes.&quot;  We only read a few pages a day<br/>\nfrom this book, just taking our time and enjoying<br/>\ndiscussions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nZoo Tycoon 1 and/or 2 - SCIENCE!!!  DD plays this game<br/>\nfor hours.  DS plays it too but not as much, however,<br/>\nwhat they learn from it is priceless and they have a<br/>\nGREAT time with it.  This game is a gem in that it<br/>\nhelps them learn not only about the animal but about<br/>\nfinances, habitats, how to help people, etc.  When we<br/>\nwent to the Zoo yesterday she knew many of the animals<br/>\nbefore we even got to the sign, what they eat, what<br/>\nthey need.  We spoke with a zookeeper and DD politely,<br/>\noffered to share her ideas of what the zoo could do to<br/>\nimprove habitats...LOL  The zookeeper was kind and<br/>\nsaid, &quot;I&#39;m very open minded, I&#39;d LOVE to hear your<br/>\nideas sometime.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso for science, a friend of mine loaned me<br/>\n&quot;Supermarket Science&quot; that features Mr. Wizard.  We<br/>\ndid the rocket launch (wine bottle, cap, vinegar,<br/>\nwater and baking soda) that was fun.  We also watch<br/>\nMythbusters, Survivorman and much more on the science<br/>\nchannel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMath U See is loved by both children, and basically<br/>\nthey are self taught and it only take 10-20 for Zak<br/>\nand about 5-10 for Brooke.  I&#39;m there if they need it<br/>\nbut Zak has even started making his own algotherims<br/>\nusing this program.  We had, for a long time used<br/>\nABEKA and dd and I would struggle and have tears. I<br/>\nthrew it out last year.  He is in the Epsilom book<br/>\nwhich is ALL fractions. Math is something he does<br/>\njoyfully now and his confidence in his abilities has<br/>\nskyrocketed.  It doesn&#39;t bother me that it is so<br/>\nsimple looking compared to the NIGHTMARE in Abeka. <br/>\nThis program has helped Zak in more ways than one. <br/>\nMath has to be done in a sort of concrete way for DH,<br/>\nso, although I&#39;d rather totally unschool here...I<br/>\ncan&#39;t.  However, there are NO MORE TEARS with math and<br/>\nactually excitement.  Brooke never had problems with<br/>\nAbeka and usually sees math everywhere so there really<br/>\nwasn&#39;t a concern there.  She just enjoys doing the<br/>\nbooks too.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting is usually done via copywork, journaling, etc.<br/>\nbut not in the same day.  They both choose to copy<br/>\npoems and we do memorization of poetry.  Both can<br/>\nwrite on their own some poems and somedays they choose<br/>\nto write their own poetry instead of copying...I&#39;ve<br/>\nnever said &quot;no&quot; nor have they been told &quot;Yes, but only<br/>\nif you do this first.&quot;  DH likes the poetry<br/>\nmemorization because he believes that it helps<br/>\nstimulate the brain and helps with memorization<br/>\nskills.  They pick their own poems, sometimes they are<br/>\nlong, sometimes short...it&#39;s their choice.  At most<br/>\nthis usually takes between 5-10 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Grammar we use &quot;Simply Grammar&quot; once or twice a<br/>\nweek, every other week.  It is a slow process and most<br/>\nof it is all oral it is also delightful.  This isn&#39;t a<br/>\nworkbook.  The children make up their own sentences<br/>\nboth orally and sometimes written.  It&#39;s not a fill in<br/>\nthe blank book.  Also in the book are beautiful<br/>\nillustrations and sometimes they are asked to look at<br/>\nthe picture and make a story and/or sentences.  Two<br/>\nweeks ago we started with prepositions.  We spend<br/>\nmaybe 5 minutes maximum per lesson.  So DH is pleased<br/>\nbut isn&#39;t aware how wonderfully they are learning in<br/>\nsuch a SHORT amount of time.  No blood, sweat or tears<br/>\nhere either.  I believe Grammar is learned even more<br/>\nwith reading good quality books and just hearing<br/>\npeople speak.  It&#39;s fun for the children because they<br/>\ncan use their imaginations freely and they have made<br/>\nme laugh to the point of my face hurting with some of<br/>\ntheir creative sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpelling is learned by the computer, misspelled words<br/>\nin things they write and once or twice a week we use<br/>\n&quot;Spelling Power&quot;. Brooke LOVES to spell and Zak is a<br/>\ngood speller, we do not spend much more than 5-10<br/>\nminutes when we use this program either.  If they need<br/>\nto know how to spell something, I happily give them<br/>\nthe information, I don&#39;t hold off or get upset when<br/>\nthey ask me, nor do I reply, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to spell that!&quot;  Again, they are<br/>\nlearning but the time is so very short.  It pleases<br/>\nall in the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve probably left somethings out but generally our<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; is finished within 1 1/2-3 hours, only<br/>\nbecause they take turns on our one computer.  If they<br/>\nchoose to do just straight &quot;work&quot; it is usually a<br/>\nsuper short 1 1/2 hour day, however, if they take<br/>\nbreaks and go ride their bikes, etc. it usually takes<br/>\nabout 2 1/2-3 hours.  If we have things to do, there<br/>\nis no rush to finish, nor are they forced to do more<br/>\nthe next day in order to make up for missed &quot;school&quot;<br/>\ndays.  Really little importance is placed on what<br/>\nthey&#39;ve done and if I&#39;ve had a day where we&#39;ve done<br/>\nlittle...I make sure to tell DH something they may<br/>\nhave learned that day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps some of you.  Thanks for allowing me<br/>\nto share what is working for us.  We have so much time<br/>\nfor exploration and such during the day.  Playing<br/>\ngames, putting the bike rack on the car and going<br/>\nvarious places and such, park days, and more...we are<br/>\nstill living in much freedom.  It is my DREAM to be a<br/>\ntotal unschooler some day and I KNOW it can happen,<br/>\nWHEN I start incorporating various ideas that people<br/>\nhave offered here.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Lisa Smith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:goobergrl6@...\">goobergrl6@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; add me to the list! :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Lisa<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Nicole Willoughby &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cncnawilloughby@...\">cncnawilloughby@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sandy, oh, Sandy, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here.

DH still is not\r<br/>\nthrilled with the idea BUT that is okay.  I think if I REALLY put MY\r<br/>\nHEART into it that DH will SEE the positive results.  However, it\r<br/>\nwon&#39;t work unless I can be around good and influential people such as\r<br/>\nyourselves. :-)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWe have been using a very relaxed method to please the DH and the\r<br/>\nchildren are very happy, asking questions and being observant of the\r<br/>\nworld around them.  I listened to the advice many of you gave me when\r<br/>\nI said that DH was not comfortable and have stuck with a relaxed but\r<br/>\nfun approach to learning.  It&#39;s been great.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m back!  I&#39;ve missed reading your posts and look forward to\r<br/>\ninteracting.

DH still is not<br/>\nthrilled with the idea BUT that is okay.  I think if I REALLY put MY<br/>\nHEART into it that DH will SEE the positive results.  However, it<br/>\nwon&#39;t work unless I can be around good and influential people such as<br/>\nyourselves. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been using a very relaxed method to please the DH and the<br/>\nchildren are very happy, asking questions and being observant of the<br/>\nworld around them.  I listened to the advice many of you gave me when<br/>\nI said that DH was not comfortable and have stuck with a relaxed but<br/>\nfun approach to learning.  It&#39;s been great.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m back!  I&#39;ve missed reading your posts and look forward to<br/>\ninteracting.  I won&#39;t give unschooling advice until the day (hopefully<br/>\nwithin this year) we are totally doing it.
