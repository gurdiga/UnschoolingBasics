Joshua, is what some would call  <br/>\nantisocial, he doesn&#39;t like to be part of groups or classes or  <br/>\nwhatever, he enjoyed tae kwon do for a while, school for a while,  <br/>\nclubs at the library, etc. But all in all, he likes who he is, and he  <br/>\nlikes to do what he likes to do. He doesn&#39;t need the approval or  <br/>\ninteraction of peers to prove himself. To that end, he&#39;s very social  <br/>\nwhen he wants to be. Take him to GameStop and he tries quite a bit to  <br/>\ninteract with the people there. He talks with one of the librarians.  <br/>\nHe has two friends that he&#39;ll seek out, but the rest of the time,  <br/>\nit&#39;s not important. Just yesterday I noticed some boys from his old  <br/>\nschool in the park next to our house. I mentioned it to him, and he  <br/>\njust said thanks, but no thanks.<br/>\nHe loves to spend time with his siblings, but his favorite person to  <br/>\ngo shopping with is me. He loves to go to the movies with Bre&#39;s old  <br/>\ntherapist. He likes to go camping with his dad. All normal for him.  <br/>\nI&#39;d say he&#39;s social like adults are, real social, not a contrived  <br/>\ntype that&#39;s created by schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 24, 2006, at 11:35 AM, Deb Lewis wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He should have opportunity everyday of getting out of the house.

What you should be doing is making his <br/>\nworld bigger than just your house or his bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is available to him other than &quot;home&quot;?   Are you offering to take him <br/>\nplaces?  Do you make plans for picnics, shopping, walks and outings?  What <br/>\ndoes your family do for fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe should have opportunity everyday of getting out of the house.  Go to book <br/>\nstores, video stores, music stores,  go for walks, go feed ducks at the <br/>\npark, take a drive, go to a new restaurant, go to movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt home there should be games to play, people coming for dinner, lively <br/>\ntalk, family movie watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do not have to force him to see friends or have friends over for him to <br/>\nhave some social life.  Getting out to shops and movies is a social <br/>\nactivity.  Watching TV with mom and dad is a social activity.   Having adult <br/>\nfriends for dinner is a social activity.  Playing board games with mom is a <br/>\nsocial activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about the weight and forget about whether he has or wants to see <br/>\nfriends.  Do things with him, take him places, get out of the house together <br/>\nor be at home &quot;together,&quot; engaged, talking, sharing.   His life should be <br/>\ninteresting and you should be making opportunities for it to be so.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18525,"nextTopicId":18314}}
