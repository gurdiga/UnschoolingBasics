What a great feeling,<br/>\nknowing that my 14 inches of hair can be used for<br/>\nsomeone else who really needs it.  My 10 yo dd cut it<br/>\nafter I put it in a pony tail.

I went to a salon<br/>\n&gt; listed on their  <br/>\n&gt; (Locks of Love) website, it said it would be a free<br/>\n&gt; haircut. The  <br/>\n&gt; salon ended up charging me, so you may want to check<br/>\n&gt; with the salon  <br/>\n&gt; beforehand. They give you instructions on their<br/>\n&gt; website of how it  <br/>\n&gt; needs to be cut. I cut my dh&#39;s (it was just a<br/>\n&gt; ponytail) and we just  <br/>\n&gt; mailed in in ourselves. It is really easy. Any<br/>\n&gt; hairdresser should be  <br/>\n&gt; able to do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kendrah<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n </span></blockquote>____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBoardwalk for $500?
