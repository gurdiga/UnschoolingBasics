It&#39;s maybe a little more pronounced than when he was 5 or 6, but<br/>\nthe tendency was still there. There are 3 in the family, 5 in the<br/>\nhousehold currently. There&#39;s me, hubby, and DS. Then there&#39;s also SIL<br/>\nand a long-time friend of ours who needed housing while job hunting.<br/>\nThey do their own thing so there&#39;s not much of an issue there as far as<br/>\nschedules, but it does mean that there&#39;s often someone else coming or<br/>\ngoing (even if hubby and I may be out for a time). We also don&#39;t have<br/>\nother kids to work things out with (which helps). On the days he&#39;s on<br/>\nthe night shift, I get up and go to work as usual (8-5 job, leave the<br/>\nhouse around 7:20 am, get home around 5:20 pm). Hubby is usually up when<br/>\nI get up as well. If DS is still awake at that point, he often has<br/>\nbreakfast with us before curling up to sleep (it&#39;s kind of his dinner is<br/>\nour breakfast - we&#39;ve had fun trying to come up with new words for this<br/>\nsort of thing!) Hubby will do housework, play videogames, do yard work<br/>\n(if needed), prepare food - as I type (working from home today), hubby<br/>\nis making cinnamon rolls and DS is probably eating something, having<br/>\njust gotten up about an hour ago. It&#39;s been easier the last couple of<br/>\nyears when we&#39;ve all been more comfortable with him being home &quot;alone&quot;<br/>\n(we don&#39;t expect our &quot;boarders&quot; to be childcare) - we&#39;ll leave a note if<br/>\nwe&#39;re leaving when he&#39;s asleep, he&#39;s got a cell phone to be in touch,<br/>\netc. Previously, we mostly just tried to have one of us home if he was<br/>\nasleep during the day - there weren&#39;t many things that required both of<br/>\nus, especially since I&#39;m usually at work during the week anyhow. And,<br/>\nnow we&#39;ve only got the one vehicle so if hubby and DS want to do<br/>\nsomething, it gets scheduled in advance anyhow (so DS knows the timing,<br/>\nsleeping, etc). The only thing that his sleep schedule impacts, to some<br/>\nextent, is that he sleeps on the living room couch (he graciously ceded<br/>\nhis sleeping quarters to our houseguest) so that limits seating somewhat<br/>\nand we try not to be too terribly loud or have lots of company over when<br/>\nhe&#39;s sleeping. Which isn&#39;t hard since we don&#39;t have lots of loud company<br/>\nvery often anyway LOL He can sleep through videogame sounds and the<br/>\nsounds of the usual household stuff, including the grain mill whirring<br/>\nlike a jet engine in the next room!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Deb R<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **********************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\n&gt; intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\n&gt; are addressed.

When he came down he asked<br/>\n&gt; where everyone was.  I told him and he thanked me for being around.  He<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t like to be alone (like Deb R said, just being around is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;connecting&quot; in some way even if most of us are asleep).  Today I had<br/>\n&gt; plans with my daughter to do something in another city. We would have<br/>\n&gt; been gone for 5-6 hours.  That&#39;s too much for him (way too much), and so<br/>\n&gt; we did something nearby (much to the disappointment of my daughter). <br/>\n&gt; But that&#39;s the kind of thing that makes this sleep schedule<br/>\n&gt; inconvenient.  I woke him up to let him know we were going (he knows he<br/>\n&gt; can fall back asleep because his older brother was home).  We talked<br/>\n&gt; about this plan last night at supper but for some reason the moment it<br/>\n&gt; was happening (as he was waking up), it was too anxiety-provoking for<br/>\n&gt; him.

For DS, even though he&#39;s an only, there were times when both DH and I needed to be someplace, thus he&#39;d have to come along (in his younger days, now he&#39;s old enough to be home for a time on his own - I make sure his cell phone is charged and there are accessible foods on hand for him). We&#39;d take his &#39;to go&#39; bag along - usually consisted of water bottle, snack, reading material, drawing stuff (sketchpad, favorite fine point markers), Nintendo DS and headphones. That way, we could find him a space to be in without having to be involved or interact as much - even if the place we were was at church (yes, he sat in church with his DS and headphones on many occasions!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes some thinking and planning but there are often more options than go or don&#39;t go - timing things (such as having at least one day at home between &#39;events&#39;; afternoons vs. mornings; quieter days of the week for the venue; etc); number of people and places in a given day - we found that any more than 3 &quot;going out&quot; days in a week and any more than two stops on a given trip were just too much for DS. No matter how much he usually liked stop number 3 or day number 4&#39;s plans, it would be more difficult. So, we&#39;d prioritize and plan in advance - we found which days were quieter at the science center, the park, the library&#39;s children&#39;s room, etc. We&#39;d even do the grocery shopping in the evening on a Tuesday (for example) because it&#39;s less crazy than on Saturday morning if DS wanted to go along; combining a favorite thing for each party - for instance, when DS was young enough not to stay home alone, we&#39;d often combine a trip to the hardware store with a stop at Starbuck&#39;s or a favorite local ice cream place. That way both DH and DS got something they liked in the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I try to make sure that if I need to wake DS for something that (a) I am fed, rested, and ready to go, everything we need is packed/gathered/prepared BEFORE I even start to wake him, that way I can focus on him and not on a dozen other things (b) I have in mind several options of foods that he likes that can be prepared in the time available before we&#39;re planning to leave. Sometimes it can take him 5 or 10 minutes to just be awake enough to even think about eating but if he doesn&#39;t eat things will go downhill really fast. For a time, we&#39;d budget each week (time and money) for a stop at Dunkin Donuts on Sunday morning so he could get a breakfast sandwich. Then, we started just getting the ingredients for a breakfast sandwich - ham, cheese, English muffin (for example). Now he&#39;s not so  much wanting that particularly but there are other options we try to have available.

How do you accommodate his","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-941424644\">But I have a couple questions, if you don&#39;t mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your son, and what do you do on those days he has the &quot;night  shift&quot;? How do you accommodate his sleep needs with the needs of<br/>\neveryone in your family (assuming it&#39;s more than just you and him)?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s almost 14 now, but this is not &#39;new&#39; with the advent of the teen years. It&#39;s maybe a little more pronounced than when he was 5 or 6, but the tendency was still there. There are 3 in the family, 5 in the household currently. There&#39;s me, hubby, and DS. Then there&#39;s also SIL and a long-time friend of ours who needed housing while job hunting. They do their own thing so there&#39;s not much of an issue there as far as schedules, but it does mean that there&#39;s often someone else coming or going (even if hubby and I may be out for a time). We also don&#39;t have other kids to work things out with (which helps). On the days he&#39;s on the night shift, I get up and go to work as usual (8-5 job, leave the house around 7:20 am, get home around 5:20 pm). Hubby is usually up when I get up as well. If DS is still awake at that point, he often has breakfast with us before curling up to sleep (it&#39;s kind of his dinner is our breakfast - we&#39;ve had fun trying to come up with new words for this sort of thing!) Hubby will do housework, play videogames, do yard work (if needed), prepare food - as I type (working from home today), hubby is making cinnamon rolls and DS is probably eating something, having just gotten up about an hour ago. It&#39;s been easier the last couple of years when we&#39;ve all been more comfortable with him being home &quot;alone&quot; (we don&#39;t expect our &quot;boarders&quot; to be childcare) - we&#39;ll leave a note if we&#39;re leaving when he&#39;s asleep, he&#39;s got a cell phone to be in touch, etc. Previously, we mostly just tried to have one of us home if he was asleep during the day - there weren&#39;t many things that required both of us, especially since I&#39;m usually at work during the week anyhow. And, now we&#39;ve only got the one vehicle so if hubby and DS want to do something, it gets scheduled in advance anyhow (so DS knows the timing, sleeping, etc). The only thing that his sleep schedule impacts, to some extent, is that he sleeps on the living room couch (he graciously ceded his sleeping quarters to our houseguest) so that limits seating somewhat and we try not to be too terribly loud or have lots of company over when he&#39;s sleeping. Which isn&#39;t hard since we don&#39;t have lots of loud company very often anyway LOL He can sleep through videogame sounds and the sounds of the usual household stuff, including the grain mill whirring like a jet engine in the next room!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

For those times when he&#39;s on the night shift (waking at 8 pm and falling asleep mid-morning), I deliberately focus on spending time with him for the couple of hours that we overlap. Sometimes it means that I stay &#39;up&#39; a little extra - instead of heading up to watch a last hour of TV in bed, I stay down in the living room where DS is, for example. If it&#39;s a day when I&#39;m working from home, I&#39;ll invite him to curl up in our big bed to sleep since my &quot;office&quot; space is adjacent (no intervening walls - kind of an extension onto the room). That way, we&#39;re still connected even though he&#39;s asleep and I&#39;m &quot;at work&quot;. And, too, if he&#39;s been on the night shift for a few weeks, with no signs of shifting, we try to figure out other ways to connect up - I might hang out and watch a really late movie with him on a Friday night, for example. Or, he might deliberately work at staying awake a bit longer (maybe an hour longer) to try to shift things a little bit so we have more time in the evening together (and we even plan some sort of &#39;date&#39; together at that point). There have been times when he&#39;s wanted to do something specific that is a one-of event (not something he could do later or on a different day) that meant switching his schedule, so we create down time before and after so he can adjust. Often &#39;adjusting&#39; means he&#39;ll stay up extra long so he&#39;ll be REALLY tired and fall asleep earlier/later as the case may be to &#39;jog&#39; things a bit. And, too, there are things that we wake him up for (with his consent and discussion) which will affect his sleep schedule - sometimes he&#39;ll end up napping a bit, other times it just puts him in a shifted sleep schedule for a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

He has great difficulty getting to sleep at a traditional hour.  He is full of energy in the evening (even when he is up early) and doesn&#39;t usually fall asleep until 2 am or later.  He has AS and increased anxiety about not being able to fall asleep.  We have tried many things: getting up early, strict &quot;lights out&quot; time, extra exercise when he is up during the day, melatonin, etc.  These things tended to increase his anxiety not to mention family members giving him a hard time about sleeping in.  He usually gets 6-8 hours of sleep just not when everyone else is sleeping.  Homeschooling allows us great flexibiltiy in this area(thank goodness).  We have an appt. with his doctor this week and I am planning to inquire about a sleep study to rule out any physical issues.

At 6 or 7, he&#39;d usually come up to bed when I went up to sleep (I have to get up for work in the morning) because a sleeping mom isn&#39;t as much fun as snuggling with an awake mom to go to sleep. Now, at nigh 14, he often stays up until all hours - sometimes I kiss him goodbye as I head off to work and he heads to sleep! We typically leave the weather channel on as sort of &#39;people in the room&#39; sounds for him. If leaving the common area to go to someplace away from people is part of the situation, maybe arrange some way to allow for him to fall asleep if he chooses on a couch, beanbag nest, sleeping bag.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, DS&#39; preference for the couch is handy because he&#39;s content with his laptop and the TV and the couch in the living room and his room is being used as a guest room (with his permission ahead of time) for a friend who moved back up here but needed a place to live until she gets settled in a permanent job. Our other guest room (the one that is actually a guest room) is the abode of SIL (hubby&#39;s youngest sis) while she&#39;s getting herself sorted out after losing jobs and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
