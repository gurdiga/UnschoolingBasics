I become a little more analytical<br/>\nabout what is going on and less emotional. Feeling bad that I hurt my kids<br/>\nis not helping them. realizing what the mistake was, correcting it and<br/>\nmoving on is huge!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was an attachment parent and we have always unschooled. However there were<br/>\nseveral things that I was doing that wasn&#39;t the healthiest thing for our<br/>\nfamily. The Radical part of unschooling really helped me shift. I was not<br/>\nbeing my child&#39;s best parent. Anytime I can figure out how to be better I am<br/>\nhelping my children and our relationship. I just keep digging deeper. It can<br/>\nbe really painful. I have to admit that XYZ hurt me and that I am hurting my<br/>\nchild. It is like double pain. BUT so worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis parenting path, including unschooling, has been the main source of my<br/>\nhealing from childhood abuse. It has been an amazing road of discovery and<br/>\ngrowth.
