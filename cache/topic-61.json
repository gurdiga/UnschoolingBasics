What advice would you give a child<br/>\nin that situation?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was SO much like that. It took me years and years to find myself <br/>\nagain and really remember what I am passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend that you encourage her to take a break from <br/>\nschool. If she could kick back, relax and do some things just for <br/>\nFUN, it might help that self-realization kick in. I think the <br/>\nTeenage Liberation Handbook would be a great one, there&#39;s also <br/>\nanother one Grace Lewellyn wrote...the name is escaping me right <br/>\nnow, something about Teens that left school for real life? Can&#39;t <br/>\nremember. Someone will be along shortly with the name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp her do things and go places she loves this summer, get a lot of <br/>\nvideos and watch them together, buy foods she enjoys and basically <br/>\nmake the next few months interesting and enjoyable for you all. <br/>\nWhich is good advice for everyday of course...but I think she could <br/>\nreally use a dose of what freedom really feels like.<br/>\nI wish someone had helped me see the alternatives to college and <br/>\ntypical jobs earlier on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd take her to the conference!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56,"nextTopicId":73}}
