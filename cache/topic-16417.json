Some people don&#39;t need  <br/>\nthem or want them. Some people find it distracting and some find it  <br/>\ninsulting to be provided with the details of what &#39;should&#39; be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more concrete examples, I make lists of what I like to see done  <br/>\nby the end of the day. It helps me keep on track. We have the added  <br/>\nbonus that the kids like to see it and see how they can help me. Josh  <br/>\nrequested his own list several years ago, for cleaning his room. He  <br/>\nwanted it clean but honestly had no idea how to get from A to B. So  <br/>\nwe sat together, talked about what usually entails a clean room, what  <br/>\nwas important to him (stuff put away where toddlers couldn&#39;t destroy  <br/>\nit), what was important to me (no leftover snacks or dirty plates, no  <br/>\nchoke hazards) and then wrote down what should happen. It&#39;s a tool,  <br/>\nhe can use it or not. I can use it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve done similar things for the younger kids, even made them with  <br/>\npictures from trainland.tripod.com. As you said, just realized that  <br/>\nyour kids may not follow them. It might be a week or two when they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t even look at them (they&#39;re taped up all over the house &lt;the  <br/>\nlists, not the kids&gt; )but when they want them they are available. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 9, 2006, at 9:29 PM, Michelle/Melbrigða wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You can make all the lists and organization that you want.
