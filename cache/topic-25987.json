You <br/>\ntouched on a lot of good points. The statement about my language <br/>\nwhen I describe her really hit me. I do struggle with my feelings <br/>\ntoward her, as my language suggests. I think it comes from a feeling <br/>\nthat I&#39;m under attack. As an abused child, I still respond as a <br/>\nvictim, even in such circumstances as children acting out, as <br/>\nchildrn do. I&#39;ve been trying to sort out what these strong emotions <br/>\nare, and where they are coming from, and I know for certain a 4 yo <br/>\nchild cannot be responsible for all I have been feeling. This is a <br/>\nsubject my cousin (her Mom) and I discussed last night, regarding <br/>\nour relationships with our kids, and our &#39;snap&#39; reactions to some <br/>\nbehaviors (mirroring our parents). We are BOTH struggling to respond <br/>\nin a loving way to her child. And, yes, we are both aware that our <br/>\nseething-under-the-smile is not working very well, as she senses it <br/>\nand responds accordingly...but that&#39;s where we both are at this <br/>\npoint. There is no quick-fix, I just have to quietly work out MY <br/>\nissues on this subject, and let the relationship with my 4yo cousin <br/>\nheal as I do. <br/>\nMeanwhile, I will take tomorrow in-stride, remembering how powerful <br/>\nmy language and the energy I project truly are. I may be able to <br/>\nfool some people with a smile, but not the little ones.

If you see her this way, (and your response to her as &quot;not <br/>\ngiving in&quot;) there&#39;s not much room for loving kindness and creating <br/>\nsituations in which she can feel okay.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Children act as &quot;good&quot; as they feel, generally.

Though I&#39;m <br/>\nnot sure about the barn example &lt;g&gt;, a place to fall apart safely  <br/>\non her own (a room with lots of pillows and soft things) may work, <br/>\nbut not as punishment.  You&#39;ll need to be nearby, so she knows she&#39;s <br/>\nnot been abandoned.   After she&#39;s calmed down, you could talk with <br/>\nher about how she was feeling, about other ways to get her needs met <br/>\nlike asking, showing, touching gently.  (BTW, some sensitive <br/>\nchildren prefer being held facing away from you or being sat beside <br/>\ninstead of looking directly at them as it&#39;s too aggressive or <br/>\nembarrassing for them).  You could talk with her about ways you want <br/>\nto try to understand her better ie. would she like you to ask her <br/>\nagain what she wants when you get to Sonic? would she like <br/>\nmore/less/no warning when leaving the pool?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s another issue if she has trouble with transitions or even <br/>\n </span></blockquote>auditory processing.  She may not be registering the &quot;minute <br/>\nwarnings&quot; (usually arbitrary time limits created for the convenience <br/>\nof parents, not the enjoyment of children) and is completely <br/>\nflustered when she &quot;now&quot; has to go.

Some kids develop impulse control more slowly than <br/>\nothers and end up feeling very out-of-control most of the time if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t have a lot of emotional support. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most helpful thing you can do, right off the bat, is alter your <br/>\nexpectations of what&#39;s appropriate for her - treat her *behaviors* <br/>\nthe way you would a much younger child&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once 10yo dd was working <br/>\n&gt; for hours making a bead thingy for her brother&#39;s birthday - they <br/>\n&gt; dropped by and this girl just grabbed the bead thing and dumped it <br/>\n&gt; all out - off the pegs!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the things I&#39;ve noticed with Ray and my gf&#39;s dd Savannah (7) -<br/>\n both of whom have issues with impulse control - is that if <br/>\nsomething catches their eye they &quot;zone in&quot; very quickly and intently <br/>\nand act without hesitation. There&#39;s not really any thought-process <br/>\ngoing on. That&#39;s something to keep in mind with this girl. She&#39;s not <br/>\nmalicious, its just that every thought and impulse is being <br/>\nexpressed the moment its experienced. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can get her attention and shift her focus, that&#39;s great, but <br/>\noften with Ray and Svh the trick has been slowing them down enough <br/>\nto make that possible - it all happens so Fast! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When we have warning that she&#39;s coming, it&#39;s not too bad, we can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>lock <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; things up, but that doesn&#39;t always happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Locking things up is a very useful strategy! Also prepping your kids <br/>\na little beforehand - not just in terms of &quot;what do we need to hide&quot; <br/>\nbut in terms of &quot;oh, remember she does those bear-hugs&quot; so kids can <br/>\ndecide where they want to be and how they want to react Beforehand <br/>\nso her company isn&#39;t quite so overwhelming. Think in terms of both <br/>\ngrabbing her attention and using boundaries to slow her down.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;d try to be a bit firmer with mom about unplanned <br/>\nvisits. You need time to prepare your home and family for her <br/>\ncompany! Maybe, if they are going to &quot;just stop by&quot; they can call <br/>\nfrom a pay-phone on the way, or knock on the door but play in the <br/>\nyard until y&#39;all are ready, or knock and let you know &quot;we&#39;re running <br/>\nerrands, can we play when we&#39;re done?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nRay&#39;s mom used to use the sorts of strategies this mom is using - <br/>\ngoing to others homes to use the resources there. Its hugely <br/>\nstressful on the kid, which drops the whole impulse-control thing <br/>\nfrom low to none. Advance notice helps on both ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  out is exactly where I want her <br/>\n&gt; because she can tear around and have fun and not hurt anyone or <br/>\n&gt; anything! She is LOUD and obnoxious.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you expressed that to the mom? That its much easier on your <br/>\nfamily if dd plays outside? It also gives dd a whole lot more <br/>\nautonomy, which will help her feel better about herself. Why doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmom want her outside?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; how can I help this poor kid? I had her once for 6 hours while her <br/>\n&gt; mom was being evaluated at the ER and I can tell you I have never <br/>\n&gt; seen a 8 yo act so incredibly poorly. She is definitely very <br/>\n&gt; inconsistently, conventionally  parented and I&#39;m at a loss.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Think of her as a *very* young child - if mom dropped by with a <br/>\ntoddler and got on the computer, or left, what would you do? You&#39;d <br/>\nhave to watch the little one constantly and help her explore the <br/>\nspace and people respectfully, right? It&#39;s going to take *that* much <br/>\nattention and energy on your part to help this girl. Is your family <br/>\nokay with that? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  she hasn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; picked up on how to act to get others to like you yet!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its important to recognize that low impulse control isn&#39;t <br/>\nlow &quot;intelligence&quot; or even a lack of social skills. Part of the <br/>\nproblem may well be that when the girl tries to do things that <br/>\nare &quot;socially acceptable&quot; her lack of impulse control results in her <br/>\ndoing those things too hard and fast. Like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She crashes into us from behind several times <br/>\n&gt; during each visit and gives horrible bear hugs when you least <br/>\n </span></blockquote>expect <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This could be either Svh or Ray (at that age). A hug is a nice <br/>\nthing, a friendly thing... the problem is they can&#39;t control the <br/>\nintensity. Ray used to knock people down. Svh does things like poke <br/>\npeople in the eyes. Totally not meaning any harm, but she&#39;s used to <br/>\nadult who stroke her hair and face affectionately. She just can&#39;t <br/>\n*do* the gentle, slow movements. She feels friendly and WHAMMO <br/>\nsomeone gets a face full of fingers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids really don&#39;t like her because of her behavior <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is pretty important bc you are *their* advocate. For this alone <br/>\nI would be really really firm with the other mom - advance notice or <br/>\nthe kid stays outside. Maybe all y&#39;all can brainstorm some other <br/>\nsolutions together - ask your kids for other ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the long run, my experience with Ray&#39;s mom has been that friends <br/>\nwho have set really firm boundaries with her have been able to have <br/>\na relationship either with her or Ray longer - years instead of <br/>\nmonths. Definately brainstorm with your kids and ask for mom&#39;s input <br/>\nand her dd&#39;s, but if mom is as inconsistent as you are implying, it <br/>\nmay well be necessary to really put your foot down about your <br/>\nfamily&#39;s boundaries. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187841659,"authorName":"Janet","from":"Janet &lt;janeteg@...&gt;","profile":"janeteg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Suggestions for a child","postDate":"1188238416","msgId":26015,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIwMjU0MjU1ODcyQHJydi5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhcnRkMCtoaXN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDA4MjYyMDA3MDY1My4xNDgzMC40NkQxMjM2QzAwMEE1OUM5MDAwMDM5RUUyMjE2NTUxNDA2OTcwQTA0OUIwMjBBMEREMjAyMDcwRDAxOURAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+IDxmYXJ0ZDAraGlzdUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26001,"nextInTopic":26032,"prevInTime":26014,"nextInTime":26016,"topicId":25987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was hoping this info would help me with a similar dilemma - but this behavior does sound age appropriate for a 4 yo separated from her parents.

She crashes into us from behind several times <br/>\nduring each visit and gives horrible bear hugs when you least expect <br/>\nit. (I have told her again and again to NOT do that please! But to no <br/>\navail. She is always getting into everyone&#39;s things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we have warning that she&#39;s coming, it&#39;s not too bad, we can lock <br/>\nthings up, but that doesn&#39;t always happen. Once 10yo dd was working <br/>\nfor hours making a bead thingy for her brother&#39;s birthday - they <br/>\ndropped by and this girl just grabbed the bead thing and dumped it <br/>\nall out - off the pegs! She does absolutely not listen to her mom and <br/>\nrarely listens to me. Her mom is a single mom who comes here to check <br/>\nher email and use the phone - she has no where to leave dd when she <br/>\ncomes - and I would feel pretty silly saying &quot;you are welcome here, <br/>\nbut your little dd is NOT!&quot; even though that&#39;s how I feel. She&#39;s just <br/>\na child!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI describe her to friends as &quot;perfectly normal for a child raised by <br/>\nwild wolves.&quot; She has no respect for others at all. I can see where <br/>\nthat comes from. Her mom is constantly on her case &quot;don&#39;t do this, <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that, no you can&#39;t do that....&quot; and on and on. I often butt <br/>\nin and say, &quot;In our house, this is OK, so you have my permission!&quot; <br/>\nShe&#39;s not allowed out to play without asking mom who usually says NO, <br/>\neven on a gorgeous day and we live on 10 acres in the country! <br/>\nPerfect for kids. We have swings, a trampoline, outbuildings to play <br/>\nin .... lots of toys, sandbox.... but mom won&#39;t let her go out. My <br/>\nkids run in and out all day! And out is exactly where I want her <br/>\nbecause she can tear around and have fun and not hurt anyone or <br/>\nanything! She is LOUD and obnoxious.<br/>\n<br/>\nShort of limiting their time here, which I already do, drastically, <br/>\nhow can I help this poor kid? I had her once for 6 hours while her <br/>\nmom was being evaluated at the ER and I can tell you I have never <br/>\nseen a 8 yo act so incredibly poorly. She is definitely very <br/>\ninconsistently, conventionally  parented and I&#39;m at a loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids really don&#39;t like her because of her behavior but she hasn&#39;t <br/>\npicked up on how to act to get others to like you yet! I think she&#39;d <br/>\nbe better off as a conventionally parented kid than she is now <br/>\nbecause mom is so incredibly inconsistent. I have never seen anything <br/>\nquite like it.  Maybe I just have to limit her visits and grin and <br/>\nbear it, but I&#39;d like to do something more helpful than that. I have <br/>\nread all the books recommended in the 4yo case and pretty much am <br/>\nvery laid back (as some see it) with my kids. I don&#39;t know what to <br/>\ndo! I really do like her mom, and they have no phone at all and no <br/>\nway to communicate with the world so until she gets her business up <br/>\nand running I feel like I want to help her. But not at this cost. If <br/>\nI knew how to tactfully handle that child....<br/>\n<br/>\nJan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Suggestions for a child in your care","postDate":"1188154012","msgId":26001,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhc2hxcytqcTdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhczkyOCtuazJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25994,"nextInTopic":26015,"prevInTime":26000,"nextInTime":26002,"topicId":25987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes kids get stuck on the idea of &quot;leaving&quot; <br/>\nand the finality of it, so having a &quot;next&quot; can make a big <br/>\ndifference. For awhile I would always plan to do something Mo would <br/>\nenjoy right after leaving a playdate - go for ice cream or to the <br/>\ndollar store, usually. Both of those also included getting something <br/>\nto keep her occupied in the car, which smoothed the transition even <br/>\nmore. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you are at the pool and it&#39;s an activity that ends at a<br/>\n&gt; certain time and you must leave the pool at a certain time you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>need to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; prepare her for that... show her the clock <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is something that varies alot with kids - and even changes over <br/>\ntime. I don&#39;t recall at what age I was able to start giving Mo <br/>\nwarnings about leaving, but before that point - I&#39;m thinking 3.5 or <br/>\n4 - any amount of warning would drive her nuts. She just didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto think about anything but the moment. Around 4.5 she started <br/>\nwanting some warning, but just one &quot;minute&quot; warning! Over the last <br/>\nyear and a half this has gotten longer - now she seems to like a <br/>\nwarning around 15min, and one &quot;time to get ready to go&quot; sort of <br/>\nnotice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wanted to add another perspective to the mix... some kids who are<br/>\n&gt; intense (I have one at my house) don&#39;t handle lots of talking in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; midst of a crisis very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Even kids who aren&#39;t terribly intense can be this way.

Nowadays <br/>\nshe does best if I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; for any unhappiness on her part - <br/>\nnot as in &quot;my fault&quot; but as in &quot;I am unhappy that you are unhappy&quot;. <br/>\nShe still prefers *less* words in moments of stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She may also be very visual and have a hard time choosing between <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she thinks she wants from her memory of her last yummy meal when <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is hungry<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a good point, too.

Most of us have had the experience of<br/>\nbeing upset about something and then having someone in our face that<br/>\ngoes on and on way beyond what you would like (even well meaning it<br/>\ngets tiresome) Try to use very simple language and be in tune with<br/>\nwhether they feel threatened by being looked in the eye or whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine being a small child and trying to express your wishes to this<br/>\nbig person who isn&#39;t your mother and by that flaw alone can not<br/>\npossibly do it right!   My husband even gets that treatment when the<br/>\nkids say &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t do it THAT way!&quot;   Perhaps if you simply<br/>\nacknowledge to her that you know she must miss her mommy today  and<br/>\ngive her a few choices of activities (giving children who are<br/>\nfrustrated some control over their immediate future can sometimes<br/>\nhelp)  You might also try to rectify the last visit (since you admit<br/>\nthe swat on the bottom bothered you a great deal)  by telling her that<br/>\nyou are sorry that you did that.... don&#39;t qualify it just you are<br/>\nsorry you swatted her (I often hear adults apologizing to children for<br/>\nswatting etc by saying I am sorry I hit you BUT you were ....).  She<br/>\nmay arrive this time prepared for battle if you don&#39;t defuse those<br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe may also be very visual and have a hard time choosing between what<br/>\nshe thinks she wants from her memory of her last yummy meal when she<br/>\nis hungry.... maybe show her pictures on the menu of her choices.   My<br/>\nson will sometimes say he isn&#39;t hungry when we go to a restaurant(the<br/>\nnoise, smell, crowd etc overwhelm him)... I will ask if I may order<br/>\nsomething for him to have later and if so what does he think he would<br/>\nlike... this solves the problem that can arise if our food comes and<br/>\nhe decides he really is hungry.   If he does not want to order<br/>\nsomething for later but then gets upset when the food comes we order<br/>\nthen and give him a bit of this and that from our plates until his<br/>\nfood comes.   For him at least it seems sometimes he is feeling out of<br/>\ncontrol and overwhelmed and just seeing that if he needs the world to<br/>\ndo his bidding for the time being is possible he feels better.   It&#39;s<br/>\neasy to overlook how powerless children can feel when the world seems<br/>\nto march on without their input...giving them some say and some<br/>\nchoices really helps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son will often get very upset if his sandwich is cut incorrectly,<br/>\nhis bread too dry (we have had many sandwiches that had to find other<br/>\nhomes when he asked for a sandwich then got distracted and found it<br/>\ndry many minutes later!)  or god forbid if his jelly is not placed on<br/>\nthe top!   I try to remain calm because I know that these are little<br/>\nthings that make him feel that his world is predictable and safe (I<br/>\nalso had sock bumps like another poster!).  There have been times when<br/>\nother things were going on and I didn&#39;t have as much patience or the<br/>\nability to make another sandwich (if we are out and it&#39;s already done<br/>\nwith no replacement ingredients)  I am lucky to have alot of like<br/>\nminded friends who can find a knife to cut his uncut sandwich or<br/>\nsuggest turning his sandwich over so the dry side can rehumidify on<br/>\nthe plate.   <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding leaving an activity... this is so hard... just think how<br/>\nmany times you say you are leaving and then begin to chat with friends<br/>\nagain!   If you are at the pool and it&#39;s an activity that ends at a<br/>\ncertain time and you must leave the pool at a certain time you need to<br/>\nprepare her for that... show her the clock ... explain where the hands<br/>\nwill be when it&#39;s the end and your disappointment that it&#39;s someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s rule that you can&#39;t change.  If it&#39;s not a limit set by someone<br/>\nelse that you can&#39;t change but it&#39;s just you that wants to leave<br/>\nperhaps you can find a way for her to continue in the pool safely<br/>\nwhile you get out.  A shallow children&#39;s area or wearing a life jacket<br/>\nwhile you sit on the side in reach.... some way that she can make the<br/>\ntransition without feeling forced.   <br/>\n<br/>\nJuggling the needs of several different people is very hard... I find<br/>\nthat simply stating without going on and on to my kids that I am<br/>\nworking on a solution helps.    I often ask one child who is ready to<br/>\nleave to ask the other kids if they are ready... usually they work it<br/>\nout between themselves without me getting involved BUT my kids are<br/>\nmuch older(17,14,12 and 6).  Often one child telling the child that is<br/>\nready to leave why they aren&#39;t ready is enough.   I have one child who<br/>\nis always ready to leave before the others are... I make sure to take<br/>\nsomething that she will enjoy doing to pass the time and take the<br/>\nplace of what she is wanting to do at home.   I don&#39;t always have the<br/>\namount of patience with this that I would like...sometimes I am<br/>\ndownright aggravated but I TRY really hard!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you may also be experiencing some feelings of being offended<br/>\nthat you are trying so hard to be accommodating and this child seems<br/>\nto be ungrateful!  Try to remember first and foremost she&#39;s 4 an her<br/>\nmommy can&#39;t take care of her that day (those days).  <br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Suggestions for a child in your care was: What to do about spiteful child wh","postDate":"1188133088","msgId":25988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhcnRkMCtoaXN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA4MjYyMDA3MDY1My4xNDgzMC40NkQxMjM2QzAwMEE1OUM5MDAwMDM5RUUyMjE2NTUxNDA2OTcwQTA0OUIwMjBBMEREMjAyMDcwRDAxOURAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":25987,"nextInTopic":25994,"prevInTime":25987,"nextInTime":25989,"topicId":25987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I want to second the suggestion for The Highly Sensitive Child (http://tinyurl.com/23lvzb), and throw out one more - Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary Sheedy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1257058298\">I want to second the suggestion for The Highly Sensitive Child<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/23lvzb)\">http://tinyurl.com/23lvzb)</a>, and throw out one more - Raising Your<br/>\nSpirited Child by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/266rrz)\">http://tinyurl.com/266rrz)</a>. <br/>\nThat&#39;s definitely what this sounds like to me - I&#39;m also wondering if<br/>\nthe little girl just really, really wants to be at home, and feels a<br/>\nbit powerless about that.

Take it in small doses, if necessary!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd was a lot like Emilie&#39;s at 4 (minus the sensitivity to seams, but with a sensitivity to loud noises).  I only have one child - I wondered why my little one was so different from others&#39; kids, especially since we attachment parented and did all the same things our contemporaries did - and I had no other to compare her to.  One of my friends had the most easy-going baby and child - she felt quite self-congratulatory that she&#39;d raised this agreeable kid.  Then she had a 2nd child - who was just like mine!  It pointed out to me (and to her &lt;g&gt;) that kids come with different temperaments.  It&#39;s us, the parents, who have to figure out how to make their lives sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That said, my almost four year old is too little to go away from her <br/>\n&gt; family for &quot;several days&quot; (for that matter so is my 6 year old:-)) . <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No kidding!  My 12 year old isn&#39;t ready to be away from us for several days, even now.  She might do two days of sleepover with her best friend because she gets along well with the parents.  But overnight camp?  No way!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Her behavior sounds to me like she really needs to connect. She needs <br/>\n&gt; outside help to calm down. She needs to feel that she is safe and <br/>\n&gt; that life is predictable. To me, that is what a tantrum is. Overload <br/>\n&gt; and a cry for help. Maybe she just isn&#39;t ready for this type of <br/>\n&gt; extended visit. If she does have to be away from home, maybe she <br/>\n&gt; needs fewer transitions and more support in decision making. For some <br/>\n&gt; a sandwich is just a sandwich i.e, my husband, others special order <br/>\n&gt; every aspect of their meal down to tiny details i.e., me. Temperament <br/>\n&gt; accounts for a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As Emilie said, temperament accounts for a lot.  A 4 year old who is highly sensitive or high need is going to need so much *more* than the usual mainstream parenting.  Maybe even more than the usual alternative parenting.  I agree that perhaps she&#39;s not ready to be away from her mother, so if that&#39;s going to happen anyway, the challenge for you is to make her time with you as easy for you all<br/>\nas possible.  Can you work with your cousin on easing the transition for her?  Can you spend time at her house, so the little one is more comfortable with you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appears that you expect her to react to everything that is happening in the same way your children do and when she doesn&#39;t, there&#39;s major conflict.  I think hitting or punitive time out are not likely to work - she&#39;s too unhappy - and it&#39;s not kind.  She&#39;s not getting her needs met, somehow. <br/>\nHere are lots of ideas: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peacefulparenting\">http://sandradodd.com/peacefulparenting</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spanking\">http://sandradodd.com/spanking</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of the books I mentioned on this list recently might be of help to you, both in understanding this little girl and coming up with alternatives to punitive measures: &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child&quot; by Elaine Aron and &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; by Ross Greene.  Danielle Conger, an unschooling mom, writes eloquently on this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/spirited.html\">http://danielleconger.organiclearning.org/spirited.html</a>   I&#39;d also like to recommend Scott Noelle&#39;s Daily Groove about parenting - a little reminder in your inbox each day. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/big-spirit\">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/big-spirit</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, most of these assume the child is your own.  But the ideas are transferable to a child in your care.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sandra Dodd often says (and I&#39;m paraphrasing) &quot;words have power and meaning&quot;. I would look at the language you&#39;re using in regard to this young child - &quot;spiteful&quot;, &quot;demand&quot;, &quot;tantrum&quot;, &quot;defiance&quot;, &quot;aggressive&quot;, &quot;destructive&quot;.  If you see her this way, (and your response to her as &quot;not giving in&quot;) there&#39;s not much room for loving kindness and creating situations in which she can feel okay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren act as &quot;good&quot; as they feel, generally.  Sensitive kids have lots more going on inside them.  I can reason with my dd now, but often only after she&#39;s managed to get herself under control.  It&#39;s taken awhile and she still has moments of unreasonableness, but we&#39;ve all learned she needs space and time to calm herself down.  Her sweet nature then resumes.<br/>\n<br/>\nReasoning doesn&#39;t work for young children who are in such distress that they do unreasonable things to get their needs met.  Though I&#39;m not sure about the barn example &lt;g&gt;, a place to fall apart safely  on her own (a room with lots of pillows and soft things) may work, but not as punishment.  You&#39;ll need to be nearby, so she knows she&#39;s not been abandoned.   After she&#39;s calmed down, you could talk with her about how she was feeling, about other ways to get her needs met like asking, showing, touching gently.  (BTW, some sensitive children prefer being held facing away from you or being sat beside instead of looking directly at them as it&#39;s too aggressive or embarrassing for them).  You could talk with her about ways you want to try to understand her better ie. would she like you to ask her again what she wants when you get to Sonic? would she like more/less/no warning when leaving the pool?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another issue if she has trouble with transitions or even auditory processing.  She may not be registering the &quot;minute warnings&quot; (usually arbitrary time limits created for the convenience of parents, not the enjoyment of children) and is completely flustered when she &quot;now&quot; has to go.  I don&#39;t know how many words she has, but my dd had difficulty articulating what she wanted when she was overwhelmed.  It came out in her behaviour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be right - staying home may be less overwhelming for this little girl.  I would think about creating a nest for you all for those few days.   Maybe the less stimulation, the better. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always going to difficult when someone else&#39;s child falls apart and you are the responsible adult.  You have less &quot;invested&quot; in them, if you kwim.  However, it may be that you will be the trusted &quot;other&quot; adult in this little girl&#39;s life - perhaps you can be a soft place for her to fall.  And you&#39;ll get a chance to feel good about helping her become who she&#39;s meant to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26051,"nextTopicId":26014}}
