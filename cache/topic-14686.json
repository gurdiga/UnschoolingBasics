Is there<br/>\nsomething you can do to help getting over all these bad reactions<br/>\nyou might have without even thinking ?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m certainly not that mum!!:)  Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re all affected by<br/>\nmoods, hormones, life changes, rough circumstances and just plain<br/>\nannoying shit!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, a practice of mindfulness has helped me step back and sort of<br/>\n&quot;disconnect&quot; from the intense emotions in many situations that would<br/>\nhave made me crazy years ago. As I trust my children to learn and grow<br/>\nin their own way, it frees me to let go of MY expectations and simply<br/>\nenjoy what IS.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathing deep, observing my own reactions/emotions and reading from<br/>\nother mindful Mums has really changed my life. An attitude that ALL of<br/>\nmy life is a choice, that I can approach activities with gratitude and<br/>\nthat each moment I live will never be again, helps me live for NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at my children and realize that they (or I) may die tomorrow. I<br/>\nlook around at my friends and all of the humans around me and realize<br/>\nthat all of us are just passing through. None of us will be here one<br/>\nday. The complete fragility and preciousness of life causes me to LIVE<br/>\nfor the moment and take stock of what really matters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just got back from the Lovejoy&#39;s house this afternoon. We were<br/>\nsaying goodbye to some of her crew that was heading to a big music<br/>\nfestival (Bonnaroo) and when I hugged Cameron (her 18y.o.) he said<br/>\n&quot;hope I see you again&quot;. I laughed and said &quot;SOON!&quot; and he replied<br/>\nsomething about &quot;you never know, I might not see you again&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe reminded me that EVERY goodbye could be our last. He reminded me to<br/>\nreally NOTICE the details around me and how beautiful it all is.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery day is a gift. If we can frame it in the very fragile light that<br/>\nthis life is, we will be more capable of not letting unimportant<br/>\nannoyances bog us down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also ok to accept those moods and feelings!! I get pissed. I get<br/>\ncranky and I don&#39;t handle things great all the time. I&#39;ve decided to<br/>\nnot beat myself up over this any longer. My kids have leeway to screw<br/>\nup and be supported unconditionally....I choose to give myself that<br/>\nleeway too!! <br/>\n<br/>\nI warn people when I need some space, I communicate my own needs and<br/>\ntry to breathe and remember that this moment will pass and there is<br/>\nalways chocolate and paint.<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t many things in my life that chocolate or paint can&#39;t fix.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14682,"nextTopicId":14659}}
