So sometimes  <br/>\nit&#39;s backing off and letting them explore freely. Sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>\nstrewing their lives with new opportunities that they can pick up and  <br/>\nexplore, or pick up and drop or ignore.

It can be done  <br/>\nwhenever a parent is available. &quot;It&quot; will look different depending on  <br/>\nwhat the children&#39;s needs are in the moment. Sometimes it will mean  <br/>\nreading while they play. Sometimes it will mean being the main &quot;maker  <br/>\nof things happening&quot;.

Kids do learn them by  <br/>\nliving lives where those are a natural part. But it doesn&#39;t &quot;just  <br/>\nhappen&quot;. It happens because parents are there to answer questions,  <br/>\noccasionally point out cool things, offer cool opportunities (that the  <br/>\nkids can turn down if they aren&#39;t appealing), are willing to see the  <br/>\nlearning that happens in playing, especially video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s several good pages.

This takes as much parental involvement as schooling- it&#39;s just<br/>\ninvolvement of a different sort- its connection and relationship instead of<br/>\nlessons and tests.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nimmerse. emerge. thrive<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lesleyreidcross.wordpress.com\">http://www.lesleyreidcross.wordpress.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163414916,"authorName":"Scott & Marygrace Sorensen","from":"&quot;Scott & Marygrace Sorensen&quot; &lt;sorensen@...&gt;","profile":"unity_yfm_specialist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New","postDate":"1294086673","msgId":45760,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYzkwMWNiYWI4NSQyYjBlNzk0MCQ4MTJiNmJjMCRAanVnZ2xlMTIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlmdGIxbytlcWJlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlmdDg4ZStlbzR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aWZ0YjFvK2VxYmVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45759,"nextInTopic":45765,"prevInTime":45759,"nextInTime":45761,"topicId":5007,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is good if you are still having doubts.

I have an always unschooled 12 yr old son so I don&#39;t have a lot of specifics for your daughter. Just wanted to say Hi - DS was born at Mercy Hospital up on the northwest corner of OKC (we lived on the OKC/Edmond border at the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, what I would suggest, in general, is to take some time off - act like it&#39;s a vacation. Go explore those places that she/you never got to do when school was in session (like the science center or the zoo - way less crowded at 10 am on a Tuesday during the school year). Take time to just Be. Then, see what stuff bubbles up &quot;Gee, I&#39;d like to...&quot; whether it&#39;s learning to knit or bake soufflés or properly taxidermy animals. It&#39;s going to take some time to just start breathing again. Continue to remind yourself (and her too as needed) that there&#39;s no deadline - you don&#39;t have to &quot;be done&quot; at 18. We were in OKC for 4 ½ years while DH was getting his bachelor&#39;s degree - he started when he was 27, having burned out on school and just barely getting his high school diploma. After several years of working at various jobs (started with a mailroom job, ended up doing phone support, software testing and website development for a software company), he found something he was passionate about and college/university had all the resources in one tidy bundle. After a frustrating and lackluster high school experience, he excelled in college (3.9 GPA) because he was interested in what he was doing, he was doing it because HE chose to, not because it was expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I started homeschooling our dd of 9 years old about a month ago.  First we did curriculum for 4 weeks 6 subjects a day it soon became a horrible experience for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I researched other ways of homeschooling and came accross unschooling.  My husband isnt to fond of it and suggests we do at least 1 subject a day besides bible reading and have thurs and fridays free besides bible reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I find that she plays toontown online ALL DAY  from 9am to 9pm with only bathroom breaks, eating breaks, and to do her one chore.  I am feeling this is just as unhealthy for her to sit in one spot and stare at a screen as it was to do 6 subjects a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am feeling really torn.  but she is the type of personality that will sit and play online games even into her adulthood and not know how to go to a job and work because she just doesnt want to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help pls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nDeana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211170288,"authorName":"JESARMEY@aol.com","from":"JESARMEY@...","profile":"mommajj02","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New","postDate":"1110328642","msgId":5008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Mi40MTIzODBiZS4yZjVmOWY0MkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5007,"nextInTopic":10322,"prevInTime":5007,"nextInTime":5009,"topicId":5007,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Welcome Harmony, I m Jessica and I have a 2 year old daughter.
