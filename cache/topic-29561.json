I was being told <br/>\nit is you making this so hard -- even the local vet confirmed (she <br/>\nknew cause all three of her boys had similar &quot;issues&quot;) - so because I <br/>\nwould not rip my hand out of his and turn my back on him he was <br/>\nbiting his lips til they bled, messing his pants (never a problem <br/>\nbefore), crying and just not there because I held onto him.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a son - I had symptoms.  He was fearful - professed how stupid <br/>\nhe was (he can&#39;t read and for the life of him when he was called in <br/>\nclass it took minutes before he sorted through &quot;wow, that&#39;s me, ok <br/>\nwhat did she say, and all the other thoughts&quot; and by that time he was <br/>\nwrong or stupid, which ever you like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSkip forward to yesterday - one year later.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom&#39;s still mum and she is getting it wrong all the time...  My son <br/>\nis seven and was 3 months preemie - he has not spent a night away <br/>\nfrom me until last night - 100 miles away - we have been through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the last few months he has been asking to stay at my dad&#39;s house <br/>\nfor the weekend.  After all of the good excuses ran out his choice is <br/>\nto be there - and he is loving it.  I have been plagued with worry, <br/>\nfear and guilt about letting him down there.  Really getting into my <br/>\nhead about MY history with MY dad and why I shouldn&#39;t trust him.  <br/>\nWhile I was in my shower talking about how I would post this concern <br/>\nand what the responses would be and as I am addressing those thoughts <br/>\nit happens.... the Epiphany strikes....I saw my son(no like really)(I <br/>\nwas saying it&#39;s about him but...) and now .... it is about him - he <br/>\nis having his life on his terms - this is the time that I would <br/>\nbe &quot;hurting him&quot; by holding him.  But he is telling me!  Mom &quot;I love <br/>\nyou&quot; yes I want to be here until tomorrow don&#39;t forget my hug!  and <br/>\nhe is fine. I have called two times so far today and sent him a <br/>\npicture message - and he has my cell phone and my digital camera and <br/>\nI am glad to let him borrow them... <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can the &quot;professionals&quot; be so wrong moreover how can billions be <br/>\nso blind?  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son! is strong, independent, a thinker, intelligent, confident.  <br/>\nHe is NOT a symptom.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProgress - without a doubt!<br/>\n<br/>\nEli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29475,"nextTopicId":29460}}
