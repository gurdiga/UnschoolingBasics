My girls are close in age as <br/>\nwell (but much younger) and my story is very similar to yours.  My <br/>\ngirls are just beginning to really fight over anything and everything <br/>\nit seems.  Right now its biting and hair pulling.. and I too start <br/>\ncrying and feeling the parental guilt from my past parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read &#39;Siblings Without Rivalry&#39; and its been very eye opening. One <br/>\nthing the book talks about is that we should let our kids work out a <br/>\nsolution for themselves as much as possible. This means not getting <br/>\ninvolved in their mutally agreed solution just because we don&#39;t like <br/>\nhow they&#39;ve settled it.  And if we get involved and cry, we are <br/>\nreally just making them feel bad and manipulating them into what WE <br/>\nwant.  I find too that when you step in on behalf of one child or <br/>\nanother, the outcome isn&#39;t necessarily authentic and they don&#39;t get <br/>\nthe practice they need to work it out themselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe book also states that children need to &#39;own&#39; their own <br/>\nrelationships with eachother. What we deem as &#39;fair&#39; is not the <br/>\ngoal.  The goal is that everyone gets their needs met- whether its <br/>\nfair to one child or not.  Fair is really unequal because one child <br/>\nmay really need more than another.  Fairness doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>\ninvolved.  I don&#39;t give my teenage nephew the same portion of <br/>\npancakes as my 2 year old.  The &#39;same&#39; wouldn&#39;t be fair.  Obviously <br/>\none NEEDS more than the other and that is OKAY.<br/>\nGiving a child what they need has nothing to do with being fair.  <br/>\nYour younger child may have sensed what her older sister needed (even <br/>\nthough technically it wasn&#39;t fair) and backed off.  That is okay.  I <br/>\nwould be proud of her and let her know quietly that strong and <br/>\nresilient people do choose to give up what they want for others.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure that when she gave up what she wanted for her older sister <br/>\nto be happy- you felt she was being taken advantage of and that you <br/>\nneeded to step in to protect her.  But if they worked out a solution- <br/>\nit is THEIR solution.  Instead of intervening in the moment, you can <br/>\nalways pull her aside later and talk about it quietly as to how she <br/>\nfelt about the situation and how she can assert herself more.  Ask <br/>\nher what you can do to help her to further get her needs met.  She <br/>\nmay really be fine with the situation.  Don&#39;t dramatize the situation <br/>\nto make her feel like she got the bum deal necessarily just because <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t get what her initial impulse was..

The pattern <br/>\nis this: They want two different things, seemingly mutually exlusive <br/>\nto them. Faye sticks to what she wants completely, and other ideas <br/>\nare not acceptable to her. Annika eventually &#39;gives in&#39;, but often <br/>\nonly out of wanting to move on, or wanting Faye to be happy, or <br/>\nwanting the conflict to end.

When I try to help, ask if we can try to <br/>\nwork something out so that everyone can get what they need/want, it <br/>\nfalls apart even more. Faye says she doesn&#39;t want to try to work it <br/>\nout. She doesn&#39;t want to talk about it. Usually about this point I <br/>\nget frustrated and don&#39;t handle things well.

As they went on <br/>\nwith watching the movie (the issue this morning was where they would <br/>\neach sit to watch a movie on the computer) it was clear that neither <br/>\nwas happy.

I think I only posted one other time, near the beginning of that three years. I have gone no mail at times - only due to making choices about how I spend time - but became a faithful reader again a few months ago.<br/>\nWe are now living in Bangladesh, heading up an NGO here that works on various aspects of relief and development. We&#39;re coming up on our one year anniversary, and it&#39;s been quite a year. Wow. We are learning and growing and stretching - painfully so at times. There is no way to put words to what it is like to try to be mindful parents and radical unschoolers in this culture. (How wonderful to see that there are people in Pune, India! I&#39;m sure they can relate.)<br/>\nAnyway, I won&#39;t get into all of that, but it has been the challenge of living here and without the support of nearby unschooling friends that has brought me back to daily digests and soaking up every word. I am incredibly grateful to the list owners and the many people that take the time to write.<br/>\nToday though I come asking for specific help. I see a pattern in the way conflicts between Faye and Annika (daughters - almost 8 and 6) get resolved (I wouldn&#39;t actually call it resolution). The pattern is this: They want two different things, seemingly mutually exlusive to them. Faye sticks to what she wants completely, and other ideas are not acceptable to her. Annika eventually &#39;gives in&#39;, but often only out of wanting to move on, or wanting Faye to be happy, or wanting the conflict to end. It doesn&#39;t seem though that she is truly content with the outcome. When I try to help, ask if we can try to work something out so that everyone can get what they need/want, it falls apart even more. Faye says she doesn&#39;t want to try to work it out. She doesn&#39;t want to talk about it. Usually about this point I get frustrated and don&#39;t handle things well. Sometime I first manage a few attempts at something like &quot;Faye, I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t have what you want. I&#39;m<br/>\n asking if we can talk about finding a solution that everyone is happy with, including you.&quot; When Faye closes herself off to any possibilities, I fall apart, feeling out of options. When I get upset, Annika again &#39;gives in&#39; to restore the peace. As they went on with watching the movie (the issue this morning was where they would each sit to watch a movie on the computer) it was clear that neither was happy. Faye was still picking at Annika and as I left Annika was saying under her breath &quot;Next time I&#39;M going to sit there.&quot; I went back in because it was so obvious that there had not been resolution, had not been a result that left them both feeling honored and happy with the outcome. I was at a loss to find a way to bring that out into the open, to be able to work at a different solution.<br/>\nNow for what I see contributing to this situation: I could cry, and sometimes do, about the ways I did not help Faye to gracefully enter into being an older child. She was only 20 months old when Annika was born, and I was not in the unschooling/mindful parenting mindset. I was in a much more traditional place. She was still a baby herself, and I expected her to understand when I &#39;couldn&#39;t&#39; hold her because I was nursing Annika, and many other things but you get the idea. Faye was able to voice to me a couple of years ago that she felt as if I loved Annika more. I have apologized and we have talked a lot about how I see things so differently now and am so sorry for the ways I left her feeling outside of the circle of our family, and unwanted after Annika was born. This was not a one-time conversation. We revisited it often, and the many conversations and hugs seemed to help. Still, I suspect the residual effects of that continue. Also, I suspect that<br/>\n Faye does not yet trust that her needs and wants will be honored equally along with those of everyone else if she enters into discussion. I&#39;ve asked her if that is the case, and she says no, that she just doesn&#39;t want to talk, but I still wonder if she has trouble trusting me, and I don&#39;t blame her for that at all.<br/>\nAlso, in dealing with the stress of living here I backslid a great deal and moved into controlling behavior big-time. As of about April, another shift happened for me. I woke up again, came back to the lists. came back to my heart and to the hearts of these dear girls, and overall we are living much more peacefully together again. Anyway, I know that my backsliding certainly didn&#39;t help the trust factor with Faye. Also, life in general here is stressful for them. They are handling it all so incredibly well, and we talk a lot, and when we stay connected as a family, it seems manageable now. Still, I know the stress, the intensity, the control of the culture, the pollution, the poverty is here and they/we live in that, and it impacts them.<br/>\nI&#39;m looking for suggestions as to how I can create a shift, begin to help everyone trust that all will be honored. And until that trust is re-established, I&#39;m looking for suggestions as to how to deal with the heat of the moment when there is conflict and for whatever reason Faye is unable to open up to a discussion about meeting the needs of all. This morning I really blew it, and we all ended up in tears with both girls trying to say that everything was okay when it clearly wasn&#39;t, and I know they did that because they wanted me to calm down and they just wanted to forget about it all and watch the movie.
