Then *more*. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, after lots of angst (which Robyn shared with us over the <br/>\ntime), she told Jayn that she really didn&#39;t want her to hang out with <br/>\nthis child anymore. Jayn was at first upset---and then relieved.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems Jayn didn&#39;t know how to get out of the relationship. She liked <br/>\nhaving a playmate, but didn&#39;t like the girl all that well. But she was <br/>\nconvenient and all.

And I did feel that I could call my dad if I were ever in BAD <br/>\ntrouble. He was/is trustworthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs teens/young adults, I really do believe we feel we are invincible <br/>\nand immortal. Age generally cures that. &lt;G&gt; Having children DEFINITELY <br/>\ndoes. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that means that our own children will still feel that way <br/>\n(invincible & immortal). And *I* think we really shouldn&#39;t try to take <br/>\nthat freedom and risk-taking away from them. It&#39;s what teens/young <br/>\nadults DO.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t make it easy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I ask because I want to have that kind of relationship with my kids, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I<br/>\nalso want to be able to tell them what I really think, and offer them <br/>\nmy -<br/>\non a few things - strong opinions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI can assure you that there aren&#39;t many people on the planet <br/>\nwith....um...stronger opinions than *I* have. &lt;G&gt; And I&#39;m not shy about <br/>\nletting you (or my children) know what they are!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean I can control what they do when they are not <br/>\nphysically attached to me. (And I certainly can&#39;t control *you*! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\nAs soon as they can drive, I am (and my opinions are) fairly obsolete <br/>\nunless they trust me. Wholly and completely. And again, that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhappen overnight. Years and years of trusting and respecting them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I want them to know, though, that I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>won&#39;t give them &quot;I told you so&#39;s&quot; or punish or whatever.   Sometimes it<br/>\nseems (from the outside) that some parents abstain from really trying to<br/>\npersuade or dissuade their kids.  I don&#39;t want to give up having that <br/>\nkind<br/>\nof influence on my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWeeeeeellllll, I&#39;m not immune from &quot;I-told-you-so&quot;! &lt;G&gt; I LIKE being <br/>\nright. And I like being sure you remember it! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT....I&#39;m different with the boys. Generally, they come back and say, <br/>\n&quot;Mom, you were right.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen THAT happens, I gain HUGE trust points! They build up over time. <br/>\nGradually they started to realize that I *AM* often right and that they <br/>\n*can* accept my opinions/concerns/advice as valuable and worthwhile. <br/>\nBut they really have to experience that and make those learning-takes <br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I see many unschooling parents who seem OK with not <br/>\ngiving any direction or advice. And, since I have such *definite* <br/>\nopinions on what unschooling is and isn&#39;t &lt;g&gt;....I think my kids should <br/>\nhear my opinions---IF I am respectful. That&#39;s part of my job: to give <br/>\nmy opinions and advice. The *trick* is not to require that they follow <br/>\nit! &lt;G&gt; I need to be OK with that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we get that influence by being as honest--------and <br/>\nRIGHT!--------as humanly possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy credibility would plummet if I told Cam that he *would* be killed if <br/>\nhe hitch-hiked. If he hitch-hikes five times safely, I&#39;m a liar.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter to say that it&#39;s a *possibility*---and a *remote* possibility at <br/>\nthat. Nevertheless, it only takes ONE psycho....<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that I&#39;m *very* influential. But I got that way by being as <br/>\nhonest as possible. They TRUST me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nStand above the crowd!
