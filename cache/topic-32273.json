For some years (way back when), DS had a rough<br/>\nbedtime, somewhere between 9 and 10 pm, when things were winding down,<br/>\nwe&#39;d read stories, etc. Then when he was around 4 1/2 or 5, we decided<br/>\nto just &#39;misplace&#39; bedtime - no announcements or anything. One evening,<br/>\nI was heading up to bed (*I&#39;m* the one who most needs a &#39;bedtime&#39; LOL)<br/>\nand announced such to DH and DS &quot;I&#39;m heading to bed, I&#39;m tired,<br/>\ngoodnight&quot;. DH decided to head up with me. DS said &quot;I want to watch the<br/>\nrest of &lt;whatever it was&gt;&quot; I said &quot;Okay, turn the TV off when you&#39;re<br/>\ndone&quot;, gave him a kiss on the head and headed up. 20-30 minutes later,<br/>\nhe popped upstairs to our room as usual to snuggle to sleep. Oftentimes,<br/>\nonce he was asleep, I&#39;d &#39;sleepwalk&#39; him back to his bed so I could have<br/>\nspace to stretch out (amazing how much of a king sized bed one 5 yr old<br/>\ncan take up LOL), not always, sometimes we&#39;d end up waking up in a big<br/>\npuppy pile. When we got a second TV (someone gave it to us when they<br/>\nwere moving), we put it in our room and we&#39;d all snuggle and watch TV as<br/>\nwe fell asleep. Last year, we got a TV/DVD combo for DS&#39; room (he&#39;s<br/>\nabout to turn 10) and sometimes, he&#39;d watch TV in our room for a bit<br/>\nthen go to his room to continue watching (as I mentioned, I&#39;m the one<br/>\nwho needs to get shut eye so our TV often goes off before DS is ready to<br/>\nsleep). Over the last couple of months, he&#39;s taken to being up at odd<br/>\nhours - sometimes staying up until 2 am then sleeping in; other times,<br/>\nfalling asleep around 10 then getting up around 4, etc. TVLand on our<br/>\ncable system shows old Star Trek episodes at 6 so he&#39;ll often get up to<br/>\nwatch that. The last couple of nights, he&#39;s decided to stay downstairs<br/>\nto watch TV late instead of going up to his room or our room. Sometimes<br/>\nI go down to get ready for work in the morning and he&#39;s wide awake,<br/>\nwatching TV. Other times, he&#39;s curled up asleep on the couch (I got the<br/>\ncutest picture yesterday morning of him curled up under a cotton throw<br/>\nblanket with the dog curled up on the couch asleep at his feet) I&#39;ll<br/>\nsometimes pop my head down around 11 (if I&#39;m still awake) and if he&#39;s<br/>\nalready asleep, I&#39;ll throw a slightly warmer blanket over him (the throw<br/>\nis nice but not very long or soft). The other day, when I got home from<br/>\nwork, he gave me a hug and said &quot;Thanks for the blanket&quot;. [cross<br/>\nreference this one with modeling kindness and showing appreciation to<br/>\none another] But, regardless of where he is, he sleeps when he&#39;s tired,<br/>\nwakes when he&#39;s done sleeping. Sometimes he&#39;ll nap in the late<br/>\nafternoon, sometimes he just falls asleep a little earlier at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we have a set morning thing, we make sure that&#39;s known ahead of time<br/>\n- we try to set as many appointments and such as possible that involved<br/>\nhim for late morning or early afternoon (10 am - 3 pm)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he&#39;s closing in on &#39;double digit&#39; age and folks start mentioning the<br/>\nteenage years and &#39;rebellion&#39; and all, I just kind of chuckle and say<br/>\n&quot;what in the world is there to rebel about?&quot; He doesn&#39;t have bedtime,<br/>\nhomework, school time, limits on TV or videogames or food, and I can&#39;t<br/>\nforesee us having a curfew (I never had one growing up either). DH and I<br/>\nwere joking about it one evening a while back and saying that we might<br/>\nend up with Alex P.

I want to share something with you that may help.   When I first relaxing completely about  bedtime I still had to really re-train myself.  There were times when I still decided it was bed time and forced the issue- especially with my 2 year old  -- my thought was that it was 10 ish and I was tired so he must be.  I also did the same with naps -- which I knew wasn&#39;t the consensual way of being but ..... until recently when I figured out the certain times I could get the 2 year old to just sit down for a couple minutes --- then he will just crash all by himself no fighting no crying etc.    Also the last few months I have gotten back with my youngest childs dad and as we were first working our way back I had to explain to tom how I was handling bed time.  Now before one of our major fights were over him wanted to enforce bedtime with the children -- and even then<br/>\n I wanted to be more lacks about it. So amazingly within the last few weeks I have really noticed that there is no issue regarding bed time for any of us.  Matter of fact within the last 2 weeks I will just go to bed and read or turn the lights off and the 2 year old will just come up and go to bed.  One night while tom and I were up watching a movie ds actually walked in the bedroom and went to bed all by himself.   whoooo hooo.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  My oldest is pretty simple -- just put on his tv shows and off to sleep he is.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nAnother thing that has helped me is to just let go of the idea that kids should be to bed by this time....   My kids are more or less like me and we are late birds.   DH and I have figured out that we can find our alone time around the kiddos...  This took a lot of pressure of my brain when trying to please everyone.  I like to sleep in when possible -- so the kids staying up a later they sleep in also.  If I really wanted alone time I should make it for myself.  Either by escaping when Tom gets home or getting up earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically keep retraining your brain to relax and it will fall into a comfortable routine for all.  <br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
