My 6yo kind of<br/>\nlikes tracing letters and doing some of the sound identifying activities- my<br/>\n10yo went through a phase of that when she was about 3yo, though I suspect<br/>\nwhat she liked most was the time I spent sitting with her and showing her<br/>\nwhat to do as she asked.  My kids have never done a math worksheet, but have<br/>\na really intuitive sense of math.  Once when my son was about 13yo, I showed<br/>\nhim how people lay out long calculations on paper (at about 2am when the<br/>\nsubject came up in conversation).
