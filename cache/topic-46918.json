It&#39;s about who you love.&quot;  -- From<br/>\nSouth Park<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it may be helpful to mention that just because someone says<br/>\nsomething to you, or asks you a question, you are not bound to respond.<br/>\nIt&#39;s a curiosity to me that people feel compelled to answer or respond to<br/>\nremarks all the time. Maybe it is an acculturation issue, I don&#39;t know, but<br/>\nit&#39;s clear we are uncomfortable with silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You should take time for yourself!&quot; -- when offered by a mother to her<br/>\ndaughter (grown with kids)<br/>\n&quot;Why do you have 4 dogs?!&quot;  -- offered by a father to a grown child<br/>\n&quot;Your son needs to go to school.  Our son gets all A&#39;s in school.&quot;  --<br/>\noffered by a SIL<br/>\n<br/>\n*******************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIn each case, you can easily hear a defensive statement offered.  Trying to<br/>\njustify your life, your choices etc...try to educate, inform, enlighten.<br/>\nMany of us have been there and done that.  Over and over.  The fact is that<br/>\nit almost never works.  There is a subtle, (sometimes less than subtle)<br/>\nattempt to bully the listener into acting, thinking, or doing that which the<br/>\nspeaker is addressing.  Because of this, there isn&#39;t really any amount of<br/>\n&quot;education&quot; that will work to bring an end to the inquisition.  You only<br/>\nwaste your breath and in many cases appear to weaken your position by<br/>\noffering explanations and placating gestures.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry saying nothing.  Just stare at the person.  You don&#39;t have to be unkind<br/>\nabout it.  But just be clear you are paying attention.  If they question you<br/>\nmore, be attentive more.  Most Americans are very uncomfortable with<br/>\nsilence.  And it helps to bring about startling change if used consistently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing to think about is WHY are they asking?  WHY do they pressure<br/>\nyou?  Is it out of love for the child or is it something less noble?  After<br/>\nall, if you espouse the virtues of an unschooling life as being as good as<br/>\nor better than conventional parenting/compulsory schooling then are you not<br/>\nsaying by default that those who DO what you have rejected are not parenting<br/>\nin the loving way you are?  You may be doing this or you may not have had<br/>\nthe thought, but it&#39;s all about perception...if your SIL perceives you are<br/>\nsaying &quot;I love my children more than you love your children as evidenced<br/>\nby...&quot; she will be angry and defensive.  She may call CPS or she may throw<br/>\nher energy into &quot;converting&quot; you back to doing what she does so she doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to change her worldview.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason people ask things or say things, especially like the<br/>\nstatement above from the mother about &quot;time&quot;...it&#39;s because (or may be) she<br/>\nhad wished she had time to herself, or she may have been a mother who did<br/>\ntake time, and so like the SIL, even if she&#39;s not coming out and saying it,<br/>\nmay be pressuring you to fit the paradigm she used because anything else<br/>\nwill shine a light on those things she may have done &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of trying to defend yourself, or explain yourself...just &quot;be&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first example, a very simple, &quot;Thanks Mom, I&#39;ll consider what you<br/>\nsaid.&quot;  Notice there is no weight given the suggestion.  But there is<br/>\nacknowledgement of her offer of &quot;helpful advice&quot; and that should end<br/>\nthings.  If she presses in future, &quot;Well are you?!&quot;  &quot;I am considering what<br/>\nyou said.  Thanks Mom.&quot;  Can be very effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn #2 Just silence.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn #3 I would also use silence.  (However, I tolerate NO interference from<br/>\nmy siblings or their mates in my life.  So were I pressed I&#39;d tell the SIL<br/>\nto drop it in no uncertain terms.  But that&#39;s me.  Might not work for you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this to say, I guess, that it&#39;s sometimes helpful to remember that<br/>\njust because someone fills the silence with noise...doesn&#39;t mean you have to<br/>\nrespond in any way.  You don&#39;t HAVE TO do anything.  Even if they are<br/>\nfamily.  Too many people are bullied by their family system process and it<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t have to be that way.  You have changed one thing about your<br/>\nlife, (the way you parent your children) why not create change in other<br/>\nrelationships?  If you attempt to make change happen and it&#39;s not working<br/>\nout, there isn&#39;t anything wrong with putting distance between yourself and<br/>\nthat system.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou only get one shot at this life -- don&#39;t let it be filled with toxic<br/>\nstuff just because it&#39;s coming from &quot;family&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: family gatherings","postDate":"1308740077","msgId":46927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0c2hsZCtzYjcxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0cWRybCt0YXVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46926,"nextInTopic":46928,"prevInTime":46926,"nextInTime":46928,"topicId":46918,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And/or at least allow us to complete growing up and let go of the idea that we need our parents approval all the time.
