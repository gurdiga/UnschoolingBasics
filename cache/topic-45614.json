Jan of 2012 - 13 months from now. We&#39;d like to welcome any interested fellow unschoolers to join us in our adventure!<br/>\nVery briefly: (it&#39;s all still in the planning process)3-6 week trip. On our way to India, stop for a week in Europe (depending on the flight route). Then fly into Mumbai and take a car or train to Surat, where my parents live, and stay there a week, get over our jetlag, acclimatize to india, eat yummy food, hang out with locals, for about a week. (this is what we do on our regular trips, for the whole duration!). Then we can head south by train - Goa, then the beaches of Kerala, the southern tip of India called Kanyakumari, and end up in Chennai (formerly known as Madras). Take a flight from there to Delhi, from where we go to Agra, where the Taj Mahal is, then back to Delhi for the flight out of India.<br/>\nFor more details, ongoing discussions, and any questions, please join the travel group<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TRAVULL/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TRAVULL/</a><br/>\nHappy travels!-neha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45601,"nextTopicId":45600}}
