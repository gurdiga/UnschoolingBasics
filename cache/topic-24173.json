It is true that there are alot of control freaks out there and I have seen the results of how some of these kids ended up. <br/>\nIt was a shame to see how many of my kids friends were sheltered to the point of not being able to go to the bathroom without their parent&#39;s permission. Well, not really, but you get the point. It is even worse to see how some of them turned out. I was the one who was always looked down on for being divorced, an unschooler, and let my kids dress and where their hair any way they wanted to. I am not bragging here or even saying OMG my kids are perfect. But in the end my 22 year old is straight edge, works with mentally retarded adults and is in a serious relationship. My 16 year old is also straight edge, which by the way wasn&#39;t my doing, they decided this all on their own, makes jewelry to sell at a monthly market and met a boy that lives 5 hours away 2 years ago, but both have worked to keep the relationship going. He is moving here in August to go to college and eventually ask my daughter to marry him. <br/>\nSo after my being pretty much shunned along with my kids for 8 years living out here, this is how they turned out. <br/>\nThe kids they encountered along the way have not done so well. One is not married and has a 2 year old already, another moved out as soon as she turned 18, and is living in a terrible area, but has the freedom she was seeking all along. I could go on and on but I won&#39;t. All this has done is proved to me that in the end I did do something right.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo yes, some homeschool parents can cause mental anguish to their kids, but any parent can do that, homeschooler or not.<br/>\nThis area I am in is notorious for over controlling cookie cutter families. And I have seen the same thing you talked about. A kid who is so perfect in front of his Mom until she isn&#39;t around. Then he turns into a terror.<br/>\nI have dealt with so many different types of people in my lifetime, but the ones out here have been very hard to be around. I have felt alienated ever since we moved here. <br/>\n<br/>\nlorrie<br/>\n <br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Sylvia Toyama &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sylgt04@...\">sylgt04@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 6, 2007 7:54:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: interesting article needs some attention lol<br/>\n<br/>\n~~It doesn&#39;t matter where you live or if kids are homeschooled,<br/>\nunschooled, public, private, whatever.

I saw this last night and was just like oh my. It reminds me the time that the homeschooled boy shoot and killed his gf parents and the talk we all got because of homeschooling. ... That is what actually turned my hubby around from sending our kids back to a ps system ever. My oldest was actually made fun of in the PS system by a PS teacher. We had thought about homeschooling but hadnt at that point cause really we needed me to work as I am a Nurse and made more then he did in wages. When that happened though and the teacher admitted to doing it and saw nothing wrong with making fun of him. Which really made me mad because my son has NO handicap at all he is a normal bright child she just didnt like the clothes he wore and how he looked because he is a big boy exp... He is 12 years old, he wears a size 13 shoe and is about 5&#39;4&quot; and weighs around 150<br/>\nlbs. He was a straight A student and loves school of all things but she made him hate it. She would say stuff to him in front of the whole class. He is fat and ugly and stupid and you name it. I was furious. I did whatI could to protect him and to actually take her job cause I guess he wasnt the first or he last she did this to. No one listened but once I made a stink she is now no longer there as other parents stepped up after I did... So it took like 2 years before they got rid of her. But anyway the shootings and everything is just too much for me to handle in the PS system. Send my child to school where they are to be safe but yet then you never know if you will see them again due to all the killings they have been having. My husband starting watching in our town alone these are just a few of the incidents... .<br/>\n1. THe blacks and Mexicans had a gang bang from one school to the other and they hit and beat anyone in between them...<br/>\n<br/>\n2. They teach sex ed in kindergarten without parents concent<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The highschool has a day care for the teen moms attending school. We counted one day just at one hs and there was 25 babies in a stroller....<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Forcing kids to believe in evolution... . I dont throw my religion in their face dont throw evolution in my kids face.....<br/>\n<br/>\n5. My youngest son they would have on all kinds of meds cause of his hyperactivity. ..<br/>\n<br/>\n6. A science experiment was done with the kids testing their blood and they all used the same needle to poke themselves.. ....<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course these are just a few of the incidents but hello it was enough for my hubby to be totally supportive of homeschooling/ unschooling our children....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe actually have unschooled just never knew there was a name for it hehehe.... We dont use curriculiams although I have some books for reference. The kids pick and choose what they want to do when they want to do.... And the reason we do it this way is because if it is my idea my youngest son wont do it he will be off out the door and down the street with me chasing him.

Lots of<br/>\npublic-schooling parents are bi-partisan. Bi-partisanists are easily<br/>\nled, and they vote.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to other reasons for this blanket surrender to public school<br/>\nadvocates- I for one, have never understood why.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I know that our home school families are plagued by<br/>\nproblems, but I have to think that through time- even now- our<br/>\nfamilies have nurtured millions of solid citizens. And surely, our<br/>\nprivate schools have nurtured and produced millions more of our best<br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not blind to the fact that many solid citizens have been<br/>\npublic-schooled. I&#39;ve even heard of public schoolers winning science<br/>\nfairs, and being accepted to prestigious colleges. Because I admit<br/>\nthat public schooling works in some cases, I don&#39;t view myself as a<br/>\nbigot in that regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, when I look at the bigger picture, I am far from assured that<br/>\nthe blanket legal compulsion of public-schooling serves society too well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m troubled by the fact that a significant percentage of public<br/>\nschooling parents choose this option because of an overriding feeling<br/>\nthat they cannot provide their children with a solid education, simply<br/>\nbecause they, themselves, were public-schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how many of these types of public-schooled kids take the<br/>\nassumptions of say, reading as something only experts can teach, and<br/>\nschool as the only place learning takes place, and other lack of<br/>\nrespect for scientific and intellectual inquiry into adulthood. Will<br/>\nthese people be on equal preparatory footing for jobs where scientific<br/>\ninquisitiveness, technical insight or critical thinking skills are far<br/>\nmore necessary than rote recitation?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also troubled, frankly, by parents who find the world overly<br/>\ncomplex, and want to keep their students squirreled away in same-age<br/>\nclasses, away from the real world, in the service of simplicity and<br/>\nprotectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m equally troubled by the fact that a non-trivial number of<br/>\npublic-schoolers are taught in that way because their parents are<br/>\nself-centered consumers who lack the impulse or skills to mix in as<br/>\ncollaborative members of everyday society--even with their own offspring.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the world is overly complex. Lots of different types of people,<br/>\nof cultural forces. Hiding off in an age-segregated classroom and<br/>\nteaching kids away from the influence of a socially formative<br/>\ncommunity environment can make it harder for your children to learn<br/>\nabout the give-and-take of life in our present-day culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen, I am not advocating that public-schooling should be outlawed.<br/>\nOf course there should be exemptions- where the neighborhood has a<br/>\nschool as a collaborative effort, when the child isn&#39;t able to<br/>\ntolerate diverse groups and stimulation, where the family lives in a<br/>\ngeographically dense area. In these cases- and when teachers are<br/>\nprofessionally trained as a qualified parent is available- sure,<br/>\npublic schooling would be OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to the public schooler subjected to beliefs that run counter to<br/>\nscientific inquiry and the principles in which knowledge is pursued<br/>\nand attained- I say don&#39;t send them to school unless there&#39;s a course<br/>\nof study they can&#39;t find in their own community.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the public-schooler comes home saying:<br/>\n&quot;School is the only place where learning takes place,&quot; or, &quot;My teacher<br/>\nsays you have to go to school to learn to read,&quot; then we&#39;ve lost the<br/>\nintellectual war to a degenerate system with a captive audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Jen <br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTake the Internet to Go: Yahoo!Go puts the Internet in your pocket: mail, news, photos & more. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"Julie Hampton","from":"&quot;Julie Hampton&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"hammy454","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:interesting article needs some attention lol","postDate":"1181146555","msgId":24185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEyMC1EQVYxMEUyRDVFQ0U2NUI4NEJCRkMxQzFDQzQyNzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PDM0NDgzMS44NTY5LnFtQHdlYjUxNDAxLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24184,"nextInTopic":24186,"prevInTime":24184,"nextInTime":24186,"topicId":24173,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"what article?

I saw this last night and was just like oh my.  It reminds me the time that the homeschooled boy shoot and killed his gf parents and the talk we all got because of homeschooling....  That is what actually turned my hubby around from sending our kids back to a ps system ever.  My oldest was actually made fun of in the PS system by a PS teacher.  We had thought about homeschooling but hadnt at that point cause really we needed me to work as I am a Nurse and made more then he did in wages.  When that happened though and the teacher admitted to doing it and saw nothing wrong with making fun of him.  Which really made me mad because my son has NO handicap at all he is a normal bright child she just didnt like the clothes he wore and how he looked because he is a big boy exp...  He is 12 years old, he wears a size 13 shoe and is about 5&#39;4&quot; and weighs around 150<br/>\n lbs.  He was a straight A student and loves school of all things but she made him hate it.  She would say stuff to him in front of the whole class.  He is fat and ugly and stupid and you name it.  I was furious.  I did whatI could to protect him and to actually take her job cause I guess he wasnt the first or he last she did this to.  No one listened but once I made a stink she is now no longer there as other parents stepped up after I did...  So it took like 2 years before they got rid of her.  But anyway the shootings and everything is just too much for me to handle in the PS system.  Send my child to school where they are to be safe but yet then you never know if  you will see them again due to all the killings they have been having.  My husband starting watching in our town alone these are just a few of the incidents....<br/>\n  1. THe blacks and Mexicans had a gang bang from one school to the other and they hit and beat anyone in between them...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  2. They teach sex ed in kindergarten without parents concent<br/>\n   <br/>\n  3.  The highschool has a day care for the teen moms attending school.  We counted one day just at one hs and there was 25 babies in a stroller....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  4. Forcing kids to believe in evolution....  I dont throw my religion in their face dont throw evolution in my kids face.....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  5.  My youngest son they would have on all kinds of meds cause of his hyperactivity...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  6.  A science experiment was done with the kids testing their blood and they all used the same needle to poke themselves......<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Of course these are just a few of the incidents but hello it was enough for my hubby to be totally supportive of homeschooling/unschooling our children....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We actually have unschooled just never knew there was a name for it hehehe....  We dont use curriculiams although I have some books for reference.  The kids pick and choose what they want to do when they want to do....  And the reason we do it this way is because if it is my idea my youngest son wont do it he will be off out the door and down the street with me chasing him.  So since it is his idea its great cause we have never had the problem of him running off like that again....
