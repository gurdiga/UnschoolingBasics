It will take some time for your twins to &quot;deschool&quot; though - to decompress and heal from some of the damage school does, like squashing curiosity and self-motivation. That can take a couple years! So its good to start now ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nA good way to start is to imagine you&#39;re on a big, long vacation. What kinds of fun things can you do and see? Its important to think Fun! rather than &quot;educational&quot; for awhile, because kids get sooooo skeptical and burnt out on &quot;educational experiences&quot;. Go to ice cream parlors, take your girls window-shopping, go someplace with an outdoor fountain and play in the water. Have fun - be silly! Spend time curled up on the couch together watching movies and tv, too - the way you would if they were getting over something like &quot;mono&quot;. Don&#39;t expect too much of them for awhile, instead work on being warm and welcoming. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;they seem happier at home<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hooray! Now look for ways to nurture that. I don&#39;t mean &quot;try to make them happy&quot; in some kind of creepy, dysfunctional sense, but see what brings more happiness into their world and facilitate that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy now-9yo has never been to school, and its a wonderful life! I&#39;m glad my older kid is getting a chance to share it, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":446570755,"authorName":"papa bear","from":"&quot;papa bear&quot; &lt;superimp67@...&gt;","profile":"superimp67@att.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New and in need of advice","postDate":"1282588291","msgId":44687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk0dWVxMys2NmNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44688,"prevInTime":44686,"nextInTime":44688,"topicId":44687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice and help answer a few questions.
