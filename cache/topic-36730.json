Does he get tested on the basics everyday? I have been wondering why we as <br/>\nparents, and those before us, have gotten into the mindset that there are certain <br/>\nbenchmarks everyone needs to do at a certain time and we all fit the same mold.  If I was <br/>\npestered daily about learning multiplication I would come to HATE it.  If your DH was <br/>\npestered daily about doing the trash or the dishes he would feel the same way.  Nagging, <br/>\ncomplaining, coercing or bribing would only help momentarily and create a need to rebel <br/>\nas soon as they feel strong enough to beat you at your own game.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen Kung Fu Panda?  We went and saw it tonight as a birthday gift for my dd.  <br/>\nThis movie is full of unschooling!  Po the Panda doesn&#39;t learn the same way the 5 masters <br/>\ndid.  He is much different.  Not sleek, not a &quot;fighting machine&quot;, kind of a goof ball, very <br/>\nlarge and rotund and eats when he is upset or worried.  He has a huge heart, a great sense <br/>\nof humor, huge dreams and BOUNCES!  Some of us float, some of us glide, some of us are <br/>\nsleek, some are slender, some plump and plushy and some of us BOUNCE!  :) He has to <br/>\nfind his own way to learn.  He has to find why he is special. We are not one size fits all.  We <br/>\nare individuals with different hopes, strengths, dreams and destinies than others.  We are <br/>\nborn to learn--ready and raring to go right out of the box, so to speak.  Our learning isn&#39;t <br/>\none size fits all either.  We were not made to go to a box to be force fed with a teeny <br/>\nspoon, we were meant to choose the size and shape of what we take into our brains.  <br/>\nSome need a giant spoon, some drink from the bowl.  Some think noodles are the best <br/>\nand others want steamed dumplings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur similarities bring us together and our differences keep life interesting. LIFE IS THE <br/>\nBASICS! They are living from the moment they move inside you, from the moment you <br/>\nknow they are there...from their first breath of our air they are learning.  Through living <br/>\nthey learn how to crawl, get mom&#39;s attention, eat, giggle, walk....Their cares and worries <br/>\nare not ours.  They are learning to navigate now.  Let them be little and learn to navigate <br/>\ntheir world in their way.  I wish we adults had been allowed to do so, what a fantastic gift <br/>\nto give our kids! <br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there!!!!
