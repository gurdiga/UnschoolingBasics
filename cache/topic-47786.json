Do you know the line from The Usual Suspects: the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn&#39;t exist? Compulsory school attendance has pulled a similar sort of trick - it&#39;s there all the time, dominating kids lives and those of their parents, and yet it&#39;s the elephant in the room when issues come up with kids. Bullying and other forms of violence, depression, escapism, rebellion... rarely ever does anyone look to compulsory schooling as a specific cause of any of those things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;it&#39;s not until you try to detox from the indoctrination that you can see for yourself just how effective public school is...<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nNot just school - once you step away from academics it&#39;s a little creepy how much parenting involves buying in to peer pressure and swallowing without thinking all the &quot;truisms&quot; about &quot;what children need&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I haven&#39;t learned this from pro-unschooling websites (though they&#39;ll tell you the same) but from my own bit of experience.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience is golden. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to be skeptical of wild-eyed enthusiasts you meet on the internet ;) No one has to jump into unschooling with both feet - and very few people should.
