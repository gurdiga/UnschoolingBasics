I say &quot;oh, <br/>\nlet me get your helmet&quot; and she puts it on. She climbs trees without <br/>\nany kind of protective gear, though, and I personally know as many <br/>\npeople who&#39;ve been injured falling out of trees as riding bikes - <br/>\nand with worse injuries on the tree side. We talk about trees and <br/>\nclimbing and tell each other stories - share information. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson, Ray, sometimes wears a helmet (on his bike or <br/>\nskateboard) sometimes not. He makes his own decision based on how <br/>\ndangerous he believes his fun is going to get. If he&#39;s &quot;dropping in <br/>\nto carve&quot; he always wears a helmet. If he&#39;s just skating in a <br/>\nparking lot - no. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I &quot;let&quot; him? I don&#39;t have any illusions that I can stop my <br/>\nkids from doing things *I* think are dangerous if they want to do <br/>\nthem. Maybe I can stop them from doing one specific thing (take the <br/>\nbikes and skateboard away) but my kids are clever. They can find <br/>\nplenty of &quot;exciting&quot; things to do out here in the woods. Heck, there <br/>\nare always trees!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the practical application really is the matter of sharing <br/>\ninformation in a non-judgemental manner and being my kids&#39; ally in <br/>\nterms of problem solving. *That* will have a higher chance <br/>\nof &quot;keeping them safe&quot; than making any kind of statement about what <br/>\nthey should or should not do.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":105977377,"authorName":"Alison Broadbent","from":"Alison Broadbent &lt;abzb@...&gt;","profile":"tttrrrsz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Sunscreen and Bike Helmets?","postDate":"1221941976","msgId":36090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxNzgwMURDLUFEM0UtNDUwRC1CQjlBLTU0Rjc4RDM1Q0Y1QUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":36088,"nextInTopic":36091,"prevInTime":36089,"nextInTime":36091,"topicId":36045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dr. Mercola discusses the risk benefit of sunscreens and sun exposure.

That&#39;s just the way it is,&quot; when the child&#39;s  <br/>\nreal objection is that the helmet pinches or he can&#39;t see, then it  <br/>\nwhittles away at the relationship. If the parent isn&#39;t sympathetic to  <br/>\nthe child&#39;s point of view -- and not just &quot;Yeah, I know you don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike it but it&#39;s not safe without a helmet,&quot; -- then why should the  <br/>\nchild be sympathetic to the mom&#39;s? She&#39;s not modeling what she wants  <br/>\nin return. (To complicate matters, often kids don&#39;t know what  <br/>\nspecifically they dislike when they say &quot;I hate that!&quot; It takes  <br/>\npatience. It takes compassion to help them help you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd regardless of what words a mom uses, when she imposes her way,  <br/>\nthe kid feels what she&#39;s really saying is &quot;You&#39;re not competent to  <br/>\nwork this out. I need to make the choice for you.&quot; For lots of kids  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a challenge to them and they&#39;ll be determined to show mom  <br/>\nshe&#39;s wrong, quite often by showing mom that her *fears* are wrong  <br/>\nwith &quot;Hey, mom, look I rode my bike today without a helmet and I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t die! Ha! And I&#39;m going to keep doing that until you admit  <br/>\nyou&#39;re wrong!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch better -- as a solution and as a model of handling opposing  <br/>\npoints of view -- to approach it with an attitude of &quot;Let&#39;s find a  <br/>\nway that works for both of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child wasn&#39;t sympathetic to where the mom was coming from, I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be opposed to dropping two melons on the pavement, one with  <br/>\nand one without a helmet wrapped around it. Be prepared for the child  <br/>\nto think it&#39;s cool ;-) But that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t see the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more helpful to work toward the goal of the child grasping why  <br/>\nyou would be concerned, than work towards getting the child to be  <br/>\nconcerned, if you see the difference.
