You should come  to <br/>\nthe live and learn conference.  I am not sure that short hair on boys  etc, what <br/>\nyou described would describe the &quot;typical&quot; unschooler.  Not sure  there is <br/>\neven a typical unschooler, thinking back to the conference.  Yes  there were <br/>\nboys with short hair, and girls with short hair.  But I am not  sure you could <br/>\neven come up with a generalization based on those few hundred  unschoolers.  It <br/>\nseemed to me that most had their own *style* and it was  like no other.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is very cool.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally I have never tried to convince my boys, well yes we did have to  <br/>\nreally negotiate about wearing clothes in public when they were younger but we  <br/>\ndid reach an agreeable solution LOL, what to wear or how to wear their hair  <br/>\netc.  They do see TV and people in society in general.  Both of my  boys had <br/>\nlong hair.  My 12 year old has never had it cut.  My oldest  loves silky <br/>\nfeeling shirts.  My youngest doesn&#39;t like his pants touching  his shoes at all.  <br/>\nWhen my youngest was at different stages in his life he  preferred different <br/>\nthings.  We went through a stage where he would only  wear leggings and camo <br/>\ncolored t shirts.  LOL, and one when he would only  wear his pokemon pjs.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway I am not sure you are looking at sites and blogs of unschoolers,  <br/>\nCLers.  Just a thought.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17280,"nextTopicId":17421}}
