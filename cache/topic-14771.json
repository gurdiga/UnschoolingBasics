Workbooks suck.  Ok, I know some people like them but<br/>\nthere are lots of alternatives :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome things my kids enjoy that may feel &quot;schoolish&quot; enough for her :)<br/>\n- Pick a topic of interest and make an e-notebook to share with the family<br/>\n(we use powerpoint mostly, because they love playing with the animations and<br/>\ntransitions and stuff, but others use Word or Publisher or Printmaster).<br/>\nThey could also design web pages on the topic.<br/>\n- Pick a topic and make a movie, using imovie or Windows movie maker.  Use<br/>\npictures or video clips from the internet, and record your own narration.<br/>\nShare the movie online and with family.<br/>\n- Pick a topic and make a scrapbook with paper and scrapbooking supplies,<br/>\npictures from magazines and the internet, etc.  Share it with family and<br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n- Help her start a blog.  Make sure you keep a close eye on the information<br/>\nthat is shared of course.<br/>\n- Buy her a fun cool-looking journal that she can write in when she feels<br/>\nthe urge.<br/>\n- Show her some cool math/science websites and games that are intended for<br/>\nlearning.  She will likely be able to tell the difference between these and<br/>\ngames that are for entertainment purposes and they may make her feel that<br/>\nshe is &quot;doing schoolwork&quot;.  A great math one is www.coolmath4kids.com and a<br/>\ngreat science one that my kids like is www.iknowthat.com (it has lots of<br/>\nstuff besides science, but they particularly like the Optics Workbench)<br/>\n- Play some math games, like from Family Math, or get a subscription to<br/>\nAleks.com if she&#39;s interested in that.<br/>\n- Do some &quot;science experiments&quot;; there are millions of them online, or in<br/>\nbooks from the library.<br/>\n- Speaking of the library, go there and help her find books on topics that<br/>\ninterest her; look at the videos and cds too.<br/>\n- See if she&#39;s interested in memorization games.  Memorize songs, lists,<br/>\nskip counting, whatever.<br/>\n- She could pick a book she wants to read and set up a book club online with<br/>\nother kids who want to do something like that, where they read it together<br/>\nand talk about it together (you could facilitate it for her).  Lots of<br/>\npeople love that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of this may be stuff you already do, but if she&#39;s asking for<br/>\nhomeschool work, there is some kind of learning she is yearning for and she<br/>\nmay not know exactly what it is, so you could just keep trying various ideas<br/>\nuntil one sounds good to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~<br/>\naka Sarah<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unbridledlearning.com\">http://www.unbridledlearning.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of freepsgal<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Monday, June 19, 2006 8:05 AM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What about a child missing homeschool<br/>\n&gt; work?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s unreasonable to have fun? :-) Doing something just because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it is fun is a perfectly good reason to do it.

She&#39;s been<br/>\nunschooled her entire life, so it&#39;s just something different and<br/>\nfascinating to her. She buys them occasionally, but most of them sit<br/>\nthere ignored. It&#39;s funny. If she does pull them out, she has her own<br/>\nideas about how to use them. Following the directions is not high on<br/>\nher priority list at this time.

It doesn&#39;t matter if it<br/>\nis easy.  I find knitting to be easy, but I still do  it because it is<br/>\nsomething that I enjoy.  It&#39;s ok to have workbooks around if that is<br/>\nwhat she wants to do.  Get a few and stick them on a shelf.  Let her<br/>\nknow that they are there if she wishes to do them and that she is not<br/>\n*required* to do them.  Then fill her life with all kinds of<br/>\ninteresting things to do and eventually they might lose their<br/>\nimportance in her life as something that she may feel she &quot;needs&quot; to<br/>\ndo in order to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have various workbooks in our home.  Keon recently did one on Time<br/>\nand MOney that is put out by Disney.  I think he enjoyed it because it<br/>\nwas like a puzzle and had stickers and pictures of characters he<br/>\nlikes.  He did it because it was something fun not something that was<br/>\nrequired.  And interestingly he got almost a whole page of money<br/>\nproblems incorrect.  Wanting to find out what was whirling inside his<br/>\nbrain I asked him how he came up with the answers.  For instance the<br/>\nproblem would say, &quot;Andy has $2.  He buys a book for $1.51.  How much<br/>\nchange will he get back.&quot;  Keon said it was fifty cents.  I asked him<br/>\nhow he came up with that figure and he said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s really 49¢<br/>\nbut you always find a penny on the ground or under the seat cushion so<br/>\nyou might as well say 50¢.&quot;  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244909672,"authorName":"freepsgal","from":"&quot;freepsgal&quot; &lt;freepsgal@...&gt;","profile":"freepsgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"What about a child missing homeschool work?","postDate":"1150725389","msgId":14771,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3NmFlZCtjZzMyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14772,"prevInTime":14770,"nextInTime":14772,"topicId":14771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last night, my dd8 told me that she missed doing homeschool work.

I truly have *no* desire to go back down that path, however <br/>\nI want to give my children what they need.  I just don&#39;t want to <br/>\nlose my head with it.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAllison has always been the type of child who loves schoolwork.  She <br/>\nwas &quot;doing school&quot; at a very early age.  She loved workbooks and <br/>\nreading.  She beamed at the sight of her Calvert materials during <br/>\nher K through 2nd grade years.  But by the end of 2nd grade, she was <br/>\nbeginning to lose interest.  Schoolwork isn&#39;t as much fun once you <br/>\napproach 3rd grade because the work is getting more busy.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>\nchallenging for her brain, but for her hands, if that made sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I help her do school with materials that will be fun and not <br/>\nboring schoolwork busy?  Understand?  We tease around about doing <br/>\npreK and K again because it was just so much fun, but it&#39;s not <br/>\nreasonable because the work is too easy.  I&#39;ve tried asking her <br/>\nexactly what she misses from school but the question is just too <br/>\nvague I think.  She can&#39;t give me a good answer.  How can I rephrase <br/>\nthe question to find out exactly what she needs right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15054,"nextTopicId":15097}}
