It&#39;s something we have worked really hard on helping<br/>\nhim learn.  Things like recognizing when he is full, tired, has to go to the<br/>\nbathroom.  While I haven&#39;t put too many limits on him, I do have to tell him<br/>\nthings like, &quot;Keon, you&#39;ve only been up for an hour and a half and you have<br/>\nhad a bowl of cereal, 3 eggs with cheese, a bagel, a cup of juice, an apple,<br/>\nand a slice of cheese.  I think your tummy may be full.  Come back in 20<br/>\nminutes and if you are hungry, then we will look into something else to<br/>\neat.&quot;  He doesn&#39;t recognize &quot;I&#39;m so full I&#39;m about to puke.&quot;  (And he has.)<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had to the the same with sleeping &quot;Sweetie, you look exhausted and you<br/>\nknow you will be up at the crack of dawn.  It&#39;s after 8:00 and you want to<br/>\nget a good night&#39;s sleep so you will be fresh in the morning.&quot; He has an<br/>\nagreed upon bedtime of 8:05 (and yes, the :05 part is very important - and<br/>\nhe is usually out by 8:07). And the same thing with pooing (I&#39;ll save you<br/>\nthat conversation LOL!)  Lately I&#39;ve been sort of testing the waters to see<br/>\nif he has made any progress and it seems he has to some degree.  Twice this<br/>\npast week he has said that he is full after eating what one would consider a<br/>\nnormal size portion.  He has only had one poo accident in 10 days (someone<br/>\nknock some wood for me) and while I haven&#39;t been reminding him about his<br/>\nbedtime I&#39;ve noticed that around 8:15 he is heading off to bed on his own.<br/>\nIn fact last night I had a meeting to go to and didn&#39;t get home until 9:00<br/>\nor so.  I figured he would still be up, but he was not.  I asked Mary Elayne<br/>\nwhat time he went to bed and she said, &quot;Must have been before 8 because<br/>\n(some tv show) was on.  He said he was tired and needed to go to sleep.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you how exciting this is!!!  It&#39;s that small little<br/>\nbreakthrough that I&#39;ve been hoping for for him.  He has made some tremendous<br/>\nleaps lately in some areas that have previously made him seem younger than<br/>\nhe is.  It&#39;s hard on him because he is a very tall and heavy child for his<br/>\nage (almost 8 and he is closing the gap on my 5&#39; quickly) so people<br/>\nautomatically assume he is older but then he says something and it is like<br/>\ntalking to a 4 or 5 year old unless you are talking about one of his<br/>\ninterest areas and then he seems like some sort of savant.  I just know that<br/>\none day he is going to be able to make decisions for himself, self-regulate<br/>\nand be as free as his sisters.  He isn&#39;t aware of the difference, so it<br/>\nhasn&#39;t been an issue of, &quot;Well, Emily gets to stay up as late as she wants<br/>\nand eat whatever and whenever she wants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you that are doubting that your child can learn to<br/>\nself-regulate and become in tune with their own bodies, know that they CAN<br/>\nand WILL if you help them.  For some children it is going to take more<br/>\nassistance from parents and for other children it is going to mean taking<br/>\nhands off completely.  I&#39;ve had both in my home and I&#39;ve seen it work.  It&#39;s<br/>\ntaken us 3 years to get this far with Keon, so if it doesn&#39;t work for you in<br/>\na week, a month or even a year, know that it *will* eventually.  Help your<br/>\nchild and trust your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13701,"nextTopicId":13654}}
