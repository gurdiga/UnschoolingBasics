Graduated #1 both in her High School and College.  Absolutely Brilliant Girl (as she was labeled).  But I really don&#39;t think any of that scholarly stuff really mattered to her.  Once she got out in the professional business world........well she hated it, and realized it was just not her.  Her Passion:  Animals!  Especially dogs.  So she gave up what could have been a very lucrative, and successful (by some standards) career.  She now owns one of these places with the big tubs to bath your own dogs.  She does not make a lot of money at it, but she is doing her own thing, and is happy........much more important than all the money in the world.  She also judges Dog Agility shows so that is why she was out visiting my area.  We went to the show she was judging and had a great time.  And I can definately see where labeling my cousin gifted/talented/smart or whatever was really<br/>\n damaging to her.  She was expected to do absolutely exceptional things by society&#39;s standards and by her parents standards........it must have been pure hell for her.

What have you done with that giftedness? Labeled as LD ( retarded before LD became PC). Did you know folks with these","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-343871527\">Were any of you labeled as gifted? What have you done with that <br/>\ngiftedness? Labeled as LD (&quot;retarded&quot; before LD became PC). Did you <br/>\nknow folks with these labels? What has become of them? Who was your <br/>\nhigh school valedictorian? What&#39;s s/he doing now? What&#39;s the average <br/>\nclassmate doing now? The drop-out?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The label gifted wasn&#39;t being used widely where/when I was in high school, but I was required by the school to take &#39;honors&#39; level classes.  Yes, required.  I remember when I was signing up for junior year writing/English classes. I really didn&#39;t want to take the two choices available to me. There were three &#39;writing&#39; credit classes -- Composition, which was a basic writing class; Informative Writing, a very intensive weekly paper kinda class (where all the really brainy kids ended up); and Humanities, a two-hour block honors class encompassing writing and social studies.  I really wanted to take Composition -- I wanted to be normal for cryin&#39; out loud, and I hated to write (and I wanted a break, since I was taking a 3-hr foreign language class, keeping me in school from 7am to 5pm, M-F). I had to have my 10th grade English teacher sign off on my choice and she refused to sign off on Composition -- told me I was too smart for that class and would only be allowed to take<br/>\n the honors choices.  I would have done anything to avoid Informative Writing, so I took Humanities.  I ended up hating it. The reading books assigned were awful, and the teacher was a joke.  I did become a writer that year -- in my Popular Fiction elective class, of all places. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At the same time I was taking honors English/Social Studies classes, I was struggling to get thru one year&#39;s worth of Algebra in two years (really, dumb math for girls, but it served my mathphobia just fine, thank you) and Applied Chemistry (dumb chemistry for girls and jocks).  So, it was a mixed bag for me.  I felt really bad about the remedial-level math/science classes, and trapped in the honors level english/social studies classes.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We three grew up being told how smart we were -- well, they told us we&#39;d all scored higher than 160 on the IQ tests, and that one of us scored two points higher than the others, but to &#39;avoid hurt feelngs&#39; didn&#39;t tell us our exact scores (like we even cared at that point who was smarter).  I remember often being told &quot;you&#39;re too smart to make that kind of mistake&quot; as  kid -- what I felt/heard was that I was too smart to make any mistakes.  It sucked being smarter or whatever we were supposed to be.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I haven&#39;t been to any reunions, but I have kept up with/ recontaced some of my classmates.  The really smart one, of whom everyone had expected great things, has gone to do great things professionally -- she holds several patents, became an Electrical Engineer, then went to law school and is now a Patent Lawyer.  She&#39;s also twice-divorced (7 yrs ago, by now she&#39;s likely 3x divorced) and when we wrote all she could talk about was how much she disliked/resented her stepdaughters by dh #3.  Not exactly what I&#39;d call successful and happy, but to each her own, I guess.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I graduated, my brother and sister did not, so I know two drop-outs.  Both went on to find good jobs; none of us went to college.  I was so mad when they were both allowed to drop out -- I would have gladly stopped, but I knew they&#39;d kill me if I even so much as failed a class, much less dropped out!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Most people I know who went to college don&#39;t work in their degree field. Most, it seems, tried it out and found it was a bad fit for them.  The few I know who have worked in their field and been happy at were the kind of people who&#39;d known since age 5 what they wanted to be.  I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up -- except a Mom, and in the 70&#39;s that alone wasn&#39;t a high enough aspiration for a smart girl, or at least so my Mom told me. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  When Will was 8 (2nd grade), I let the schools test him because they bugged me so about it (I knew he wasn&#39;t LD and thought it would get them off my back). They ruled out LD, deciding instead that he was either lazy and unmotivated, or had bad study skills, or maybe his homelife (me, yanno) just didn&#39;t encourage him enough.  It seems that even when one can avoid the LD label, they have another one handy to put on a child.  I realized then that the whole point of the labels is to remove all responsbility for failure from the school system -- it becomes all about the child&#39;s flaws.  Either s/he never had any potential, or s/he squandered it despite the schools &#39;best&#39; efforts.  Really a very handy system for the schools, doncha think?.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Mom to<br/>\n  Will (21) Andy (10) and Dan (5-1/2) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  www.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\n   <br/>\n    Life is what happens while youre busy making other plans. ~ John Lennon<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nCheck out the all-new Yahoo!
