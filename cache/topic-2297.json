It comes to us at a time when there is great uneasiness from the increasing numbers of children demonstrating so-called behavioral disorders who are being classified as �educationally difficult.� K�hler protests against the present societal labeling that makes life unbearable for children. He challenges these accepted patterns of thought and outlines a spiritually deepened concept of education and upbringing that is truly refreshing.
