We were careful to serve meals at specific times, although food was available all the time, too. For Ray it was also important that the things he needed and wanted be put back in The Right Place - or he honestly couldn&#39;t find them. One morning we discovered he hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast bc he couldn&#39;t find the cereal - the box was on the table, rather than in its place on the shelf. So we got really careful about putting things Back, and separating out food for Ray on a special shelf that others were asked not to use at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n At the time we were living communally, so there was a lot of spontaneous behavior going on ;) That made it all the more important for Ray that his own needs were taken care of the way he needed them to be. When that happened, he was able to deal with the ebb and flow of others&#39; lives around him without much stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":252034231,"authorName":"cfhthinks","from":"&quot;cfhthinks&quot; &lt;cfhthinks@...&gt;","profile":"cfhthinks","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Different needs - routine and spontaneity","postDate":"1239756381","msgId":39567,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdzM2FvdCs1Zm5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39570,"prevInTime":39566,"nextInTime":39568,"topicId":39567,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been reading group digests for the last week or so.
