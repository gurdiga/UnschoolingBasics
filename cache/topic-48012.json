So storage bins might be the thing. We all meet together as families for the study, but if some kids want to wander off and play together, none of us have any problem with it. There are a mixture of older and younger kids, which works out nice during the play time afterwards. They all watch out for one another. Nothing formal. My house is small~you can sit in the living room and feel like you are in the kids rooms don&#39;t know that my kids have expressed much about what their expectations are to my guests. I will make sure they know to do this now. Thank you for helping me think this through. They have grown up so &quot;respectful&quot; to guests and other&#39;s needs, that they have lost their own needs in this scenario... I should have seen this for what it is. And there has been occasions when my ds has told someone &quot;no&quot; to a toy and that child will still do what they please. It sounds like I may need to implement a few rules for all the kids at the beginning of each study that occurs at my house. Other kids seem to have no problem standing up and getting into someones face if they want to. As far as I know off limit items are not a problem at other homes. I should peek in from time to time, in an obvious way, for my kids. Also, give them freedom during the study to come tell me if their boundaries are being crossed. Most of the kids are likely to respect the boundaries after an adult reinforces them... Which is sad that my kids opinions are not that important to a few... Or i could re-think the whole thing and stay in there with them, if that is needed. That is, after I implement the &quot;locked door&quot; policy. But if they prefer me to stay in there, I surely will. Thank you for the advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa in AL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 9, 2012, at 7:10 AM, Debra Rossing wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Since you&#39;ve got limited space, is there a way to &#39;wall off&#39; some things or get really large bins to store things in?

On the IL side of the family, DS is 5 yrs older than next cousin who is 5 yrs older than littlest cousin, so now they&#39;re 13, 8, 3. Which means that when cousin T was a toddler, DS was around 7. He didn&#39;t want T getting into his Legos, cars, etc. So, before T came over to visit, DS and I would go through the &#39;public&#39; spaces in the house and gather up anything that DS didn&#39;t want T to get into. We&#39;d also look for things that might be fun and safe for a toddler (we showed DS the toilet paper tube test for babies/toddlers - if a toy fits through a TP tube, like a Lego brick would, it&#39;s a potential choking hazard) - we had a small bin of TP tubes, stuffed critters, etc that we&#39;d have in an accessible, visible, public space. Everything else went into DS&#39; room or got put up in a cupboard. DS&#39; room was/is HIS space - no one goes in there without his OK. So, he could &#39;retreat&#39; to that space and it was MY job to run interference and make sure that no one, adult or child, tried to invade. Fast forward 5 years to littlest cousin E. DS is quite gentle and fun with her to the point that if he&#39;s in the room with her, playing, the adults don&#39;t get too concerned because they know he will keep her safe (even from cousin T if he starts getting a bit &#39;exuberant&#39; in his play) and entertained. That said, however, we make sure he knows that he&#39;s not solely responsible and on his own there - he can &#39;check out&#39; and go do his own thing, and I usually touch base regularly to see how he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other thing, as was mentioned, is that for the time being at least, other places besides HIS home might be better for meet ups. And, if the main issue is you and your sister getting together, maybe that needs to be a &#39;girl&#39;s night/spa day&#39; without the kids at all - whether that means evenings and weekends when partners are available or hiring a local teen to hang out with your DS (and she handles logistics for her toddlers) for daytimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb R<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **********************************************************************<br/>\n&gt; This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\n&gt; intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\n&gt; are addressed.

I left the rigorous Bourg like mentality of the Charlotte Mason method, which I faithfully implemented for 4 years. I jumped in to the weird and mysterious waters of unschooling with both feet 5 weeks ago. We were all withering under the heavy hand of the CM method. Since that day, we have had so much fun on a daily basis. We actually enjoy one another. I mean, my life, prior to unschooling was filled with controlling my 2 older kids. THat goes without saying if you know anything about the CM method. At least the level I allowed it. Sigh... My dc spent their time trying to escape that control and hack the system. It was exhausting and meaningless.  They do see where I was coming from now; that I acted out of the knowledge I had then, and that I was afraid to let unschooling engulf our family. But since then, my kids are happier. Truly. More vivacious, honest, less controlling to one another, better at seeing things through~all these things I tried to manufacture through lessons and stories and chores have naturally shown themselves through my love to them by allowing them to choose. Because they are whole persons. It is so cool. This is not hyperbole, though I am sure it sounds like it. It is so freeing to say truthfully, that my kids are happy with what they are doing. All the guilt from trying to make them happy, put forth the image of being happy, telling myself it is all for &quot;their good&quot;, has rolled off my back... I can&#39;t read enough about the subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now that you know me a little bit...<br/>\nWe are going through a similar situation. Our church meets in houses, most often my house. It is not an overstatement to say my oldest 2 children hate it. And I am to blame since I never asked them if they wanted to, or when I did mention it, I didn&#39;t inform them properly. So they are dealing with the consequences of their parents decission. They do, at least, like the people that come over. For now... But they have had numerous toys broken and Lego creations dissasembled. They usually put away the special toys so that noting happens to them. But sometimes our guests know no bounds and forget that they are guests by getting those sacred creations down and playing with them, ultimately breaking them in some way. Most people, there are a few exceptions, leave the kids with a giant mess afterwards. I guess I have been part of that &quot;most people&quot; group. Until unschooling I rarely offered to help them in their room, on account of the whole &quot;lesson&quot; thing. And we haven&#39;t met here since we started unschooling, on account of us falling sick. (I am applying the suggestions to my own situation here.) I love the idea here about re-zoning their rooms as a private place. The grownups meet and fill up our living room-dining room area. There really is nowhere else but their room  or my room. My room is off limits. So how can I give the young ones the same freedom? I should say here, that they share a room. Also, we will meet in houses for only a few more months.... Perhaps I need to help them clean it afterwards, or allow my kids the opportunity to say what is off limits. I am thinking outloud. Pay them rent on behalf of the other kids? I don&#39;t mean to hijack the converation. I hope that the feedback will overlap and help us both out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\nMelissa in AL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 8, 2012, at 4:09 AM, tlbtsrh wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My kids do not always like sharing their things, so we have a set of toys that are for visitors - our old building blocks, some toys that I know will interest our visitors - one particularly likes super heros and another dinosaurs, so I keep a few around to help them feel comfortable in my home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We also have shared spaces such as the living room, kitchen and garden and private spaces - bedrooms.

On the IL side of the family, DS is 5 yrs older than next cousin who is 5 yrs older than littlest cousin, so now they&#39;re 13, 8, 3. Which means that when cousin T was a toddler, DS was around 7. He didn&#39;t want T getting into his Legos, cars, etc. So, before T came over to visit, DS and I would go through the &#39;public&#39; spaces in the house and gather up anything that DS didn&#39;t want T to get into. We&#39;d also look for things that might be fun and safe for a toddler (we showed DS the toilet paper tube test for babies/toddlers - if a toy fits through a TP tube, like a Lego brick would, it&#39;s a potential choking hazard) - we had a small bin of TP tubes, stuffed critters, etc that we&#39;d have in an accessible, visible, public space. Everything else went into DS&#39; room or got put up in a cupboard. DS&#39; room was/is HIS space - no one goes in there without his OK. So, he could &#39;retreat&#39; to that space and it was MY job to run interference and make sure that no one, adult or child, tried to invade. Fast forward 5 years to littlest cousin E. DS is quite gentle and fun with her to the point that if he&#39;s in the room with her, playing, the adults don&#39;t get too concerned because they know he will keep her safe (even from cousin T if he starts getting a bit &#39;exuberant&#39; in his play) and entertained. That said, however, we make sure he knows that he&#39;s not solely responsible and on his own there - he can &#39;check out&#39; and go do his own thing, and I usually touch base regularly to see how he&#39;s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing, as was mentioned, is that for the time being at least, other places besides HIS home might be better for meet ups. And, if the main issue is you and your sister getting together, maybe that needs to be a &#39;girl&#39;s night/spa day&#39; without the kids at all - whether that means evenings and weekends when partners are available or hiring a local teen to hang out with your DS (and she handles logistics for her toddlers) for daytimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
