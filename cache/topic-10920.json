Keon falls into that &quot;autistic spectrum.&quot;  I <br/>\nused to torment myself because he wasn&#39;t &quot;on track&quot; with the things <br/>\nhe &quot;should&quot; be doing.  Then one day I decided that Keon was doing <br/>\nthe things that he &quot;should&quot; be doing because those were the things <br/>\nthat he needed to be doing at that time.  He&#39;s almost 8 and still <br/>\ncan&#39;t tie his shoe laces.  So I buy him velcro, slip on and <br/>\nsandals.  Sure he &quot;should&quot; be able to tie shoes (according to &quot;the <br/>\nlists&quot;), but it is a series of steps that has confounded him.  One <br/>\nday when he has the need to tie shoes he&#39;ll be able to.  He was that <br/>\nway with reading.  He &quot;should&quot; have been able to read at a certain <br/>\nlevel according to some list.  But he had no need to read.  Then he <br/>\nstarted playing video games and his sisters got tired of reading him <br/>\nthe instructions and scenarios.  Now he reads at a much higher level <br/>\n(I suppose) than most of his almost 8yo counterparts.  I say &quot;I <br/>\nsuppose&quot; because in reality I don&#39;t know, but I presume that most <br/>\nkids his age are daunted by many of the words he uses in his <br/>\nvocabulary and his &quot;unfear&quot; of any word.  (He believes that now <br/>\nbecause he knows how to read he knows how to read *every* word and <br/>\nfor the most part will, although I did have to tell him how to <br/>\ncorrectly pronounce Porsche and that maybe just because he knows how <br/>\nto read doesn&#39;t mean he understands French.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Thanks for the encouragement.","postDate":"1142866168","msgId":10922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMxMjk1QjM4LTc5NjMtNDRFMC04RUVBLTY1OTk1RUJGNkNBREBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGR2bWRzaCs2bXJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR2bWRzaCs2bXJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10920,"nextInTopic":10934,"prevInTime":10921,"nextInTime":10923,"topicId":10920,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Just wanted to add encouragement.
