What disturbs <br/>\npeople, yes even young children, varies greatly.  Some <br/>\nmovies/songs/books/ that are made specifically for children can be <br/>\nvery scary to some.  And some things that scare certain adults may <br/>\nnot scare some children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when we first got the movie &quot;The Matrix&quot; on DVD, and dh <br/>\nand I watched it.  Darcy was 5, I think, and she asked about it.  I <br/>\nsaid that she might find it scary, and she said that she didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto watch it.  But a few days later, she asked if she could.  So dh <br/>\nand I sat down to watch it with her.  She thought some of it was <br/>\ncool, and then she lost interest and went off to play - no further <br/>\ninterest in it ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso at the age of 5, she picked up a book of folk stories that we <br/>\nhad and proceeded to read several of the stories.  I didn&#39;t think <br/>\nmuch of it until she was scared to sleep by herself that night when <br/>\nshe usually did go to sleep alone.  She was scared to go to sleep <br/>\nwithout me for months after that.  I never would have thought to <br/>\nprotect her from my book of folk tales that I guess had a few ghost <br/>\nstories in it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never liked clowns or puppets - they kind of freak me out.  <br/>\nAnd what scared me the most and for the longest time were natural <br/>\ndisasters like tornadoes and earthquakes.  Even if I wanted the <br/>\nworld to be good, there&#39;s no way that my parents could protect me <br/>\nfrom the knowledge that tornadoes and earthquakes occur, at least <br/>\nnot for long.  I had terrible dreams about them for years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I&#39;m not saying to sit your child down in front of a horror <br/>\nmovie in order to see if it scares them or not.  But if they express <br/>\nan interest in watching something and you talk about it with them, <br/>\noffer to skip anything they want to skip or just turn it off if they <br/>\nwant, I don&#39;t think it will be a problem.  If they have the power to <br/>\nturn it off or the opportunity to talk about it, it won&#39;t have any <br/>\npower over them.  Every child is probably scared of something, and <br/>\nthey may not know they are scared of something until they see it, <br/>\nbut I think it&#39;s just as likely to be tornadoes or clowns or bugs or <br/>\ndogs as it is to be something from a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: limiting TV","postDate":"1174702847","msgId":22466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV1MjF0ditka2JuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGV1MTA0Nyt2ZTBqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22461,"nextInTopic":22469,"prevInTime":22465,"nextInTime":22467,"topicId":22381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~  Would you let your 5 y.o. watch Jaws ?!?!?~~ Yes, I would.

I observed over the years that<br/>\nchildren that visited our home that came from tv limiting homes would<br/>\nsit and watch ANYTHING that was on a television mindlessly and never<br/>\nwanted to do anything else, they would sit inside and watch while my<br/>\nkids would be outside playing!   My husband LOVES tv... me...not so<br/>\nmuch but that is just me... so limiting tv was never really an idea<br/>\nthat was going to fly at my house!   What I see in my children is that<br/>\nthey limit themselves by having been allowed to watch as much as they<br/>\nwant they realize when they feel foggy from being sedentary too long<br/>\n(my 5 yr old hops up and down and flaps when he is excited so tv is<br/>\nvery active for him!!HA!)   They also chose good programming most of<br/>\nthe time... Myth Busters, Discovery channel, animal planet, Discovery<br/>\nHealth, Learning Channel, PBS and so on.   They watch junk too but<br/>\nrarely all day long and never with the intensity that I see in their<br/>\nTV limited friends.   Their favorite toys are and have always been the<br/>\nsimple things like blocks,legos, kenex, chalk, crayons, clay etc they<br/>\nhave never craved toys that &quot;do too much&quot; they like to be creative<br/>\nwith dressing up, playing with puppets and so forth.    When we first<br/>\ngot a video game system I worried they would play all the time (and I<br/>\nam learning in that case so what!?)  but they didn&#39;t they play when<br/>\nthey want and decide when they have had enough.  Sometimes they play<br/>\nalot of hours in the day and sometimes not.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have realized over the years that what is stimulating to one<br/>\nperson may not be to another.  We all have things we do for a lot of<br/>\nhours in the day... it could be reading, it could be internet, it<br/>\ncould be gardening, or a million other things that don&#39;t have the same<br/>\nvalue to everyone... I think it&#39; s more that we chose to use our time<br/>\n(and our children chose to use theirs) in ways that are stimulating to<br/>\nus and cause us to grow.    Enjoyment is the goal for us because I<br/>\nrealized a long time ago that happy children (and all people) grow and<br/>\nlearn more when they are happy.   When I see kids that are so bound up<br/>\nin the rules of life at their house that they become surly and dull it<br/>\njust breaks my heart.   They seem to get so stagnant from the fear of<br/>\nbreaking a rule or being chastised for doing something their parents<br/>\nsee as worthless they just stop doing anything.   Or their parents<br/>\npack their schedules with all the things they think their kids should<br/>\nbe doing that they never get the chance to find out what they might<br/>\nlike.   I recently listened to a conversation between a mother and<br/>\nchild where the child was asking for dance lessons and the mother was<br/>\nlisting all the activities they were scheduled to do on each day and<br/>\nhow dance would not fit in... the child said well I don&#39;t really enjoy<br/>\n the art class I am taking could I stop that and do dance instead....<br/>\nthe mom stood there explaining how it would be wrong to just quit and<br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t going to raise a quiter!

Had nothing to do with children, just that Star Trek Next Generation went off the air, dh didn&#39;t like the newer Star Treks and I&#39;d always wanted to live with the TV anyway.  We very occasionally rent DVDs to watch on the computer or when we&#39;re at grandparents&#39; houses, but basically we&#39;re just not big TV or movie people ourselves and the children certainly don&#39;t ask for it.  (Actually, it was kind of a bummer the last time we stayed in a hotel because they kept bouncing on the beds and I hoped that the TV would entertain them as a novelty.  It didn&#39;t.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nSooo... would you go out and get a TV in order that the children had exposure to it?  (I have to say I&#39;m not considering that, but I&#39;m curious what others think.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine (who did spend a large portion of Christmas vacation watching most of the first season of Gilmore Girls with her sister who had gotten the DVD as a present for our mom -- who didn&#39;t have time then to watch with us!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBored stiff?
