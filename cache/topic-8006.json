Parents who choose home-schooling want to instill in their  children their own deeply<br/>\n  held beliefs.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Again, a newer study might have indicated that it is about how schools  accomplish their &#39;goals&#39; as well as how worthy those goals are. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\nMost of these parents are willing to take on traditional roles of  male breadwinner and female caretaker to accomplish this end. It makes  you wonder if the intensity of this commitment isn&#39;t so much about a  good education as<br/>\n  it is about political inculcation. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Huh? Is she implying that all parents in traditional roles hold the same political beliefs?  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  One benefit of a secular education is its exposure to diverse views.  This is something home-schooling may not offer if a parent considers  secular exposure a detriment.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  *******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  First, this assumes that a home education is not secular.  Second,  one of the things public (I&#39;m guessing this is what she meant by  secular) does best is to crush all hope for true diversity.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\nI know from experience that a teacher&#39;s passion for a topic is just  as important as the topic itself. That passion is more often found in  teachers who pursue this as a career.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\n  In 13 years of public school, I remember only two teachers whose  passion passion for a topic encouraged in me a lifelong love of  something.  I remember many more teachers who managed to suck all  the joy out of not only the topic they taught, but any room they  occupied.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Since finishing school, I&#39;ve met many more people in real life who  did/do more for my passions than I found in school.  I lost years  to pursue interests because my school experiences had left me feeling  inadequate to some topics.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\nWe also have to consider what this means for the future of public  education. University of Illinois professor Chris Lubienski contends  that home-schooling is not only a response to deteriorating public  schools, but a<br/>\n  cause of its decline. Schools should be given the chance to respond to public needs, he argues.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  *******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Ah, now we get to the real point of her argument -- protecting the  public school system, even if it means holding children hostage to  failing practices.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Home-schooling doesn&#39;t help the public good, just<br/>\n  the individual. And our future is about all children, not just our own.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Yeah, well I don&#39;t have the resources to save all children.   Neither am I willing to sacrifice my children to further someone else&#39;s  interpretation of the public good.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n            <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
