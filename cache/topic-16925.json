Since toddler sized kids tend <br/>\nto gravitate toward other kids anyway, it seems like this would be a <br/>\nreasonable tack to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never had a problem with DS getting lost, partly because he&#39;s <br/>\nalways had a fairly large &#39;range&#39; - rule of thumb was &quot;if you can see <br/>\nmy eyeballs, I can see you&quot; so he can range anywhere that my eyeballs <br/>\ncan spot - gives a fairly large &#39;roaming zone&#39; yet still where I can <br/>\ntrack him. When he was littler, he&#39;d grab whatever part of me he chose <br/>\nto hold - pants leg, pocket, jacket sleeve, hand, whatever - having <br/>\nsome measure of control over things helped. And, sometimes, rather <br/>\nthan hold his hand (or have him hold mine) I&#39;d put my arm around his <br/>\nshoulders, friendly-like, and we&#39;d walk like that - and now that he&#39;s <br/>\n8 he puts his arm around my waist sometimes as we walk through parking <br/>\nlots and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving to let go and let him go to the men&#39;s room (he&#39;s now 8) over <br/>\nthe last couple years has been really hard on me, nervous-wise. When <br/>\nhe was first making that transition, I&#39;d stand right nearby the door <br/>\nand listen for unusual sounds and &quot;memorize&quot; anyone who went in or <br/>\nout - relative height (my height, a little taller, tall as DH, a lot <br/>\ntaller, etc), coloring (dark hair, light hair, short or long hair, <br/>\nfacial hair, etc), clothing, etc &quot;just in case&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that we&#39;ve done (DS started doing it on his own and we&#39;ve <br/>\nmade a habit of it) is that when I needed to go to the ladies&#39; room at <br/>\nthe mall, he stood just outside it (since they don&#39;t have doors any <br/>\nmore, just L shaped type walls to create a private space for the <br/>\nstalls) he picks a song and sings or hums just loud enough for me to <br/>\nhear but not really loud - so long as I can hear his hum, I know he&#39;s <br/>\nright there. And I do the same when he&#39;s inside and I&#39;m outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265615958,"authorName":"Anna Sherman","from":"Anna Sherman &lt;as007i0152@...&gt;","profile":"anna_mumx5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Keeping children safe in crowded public indoor areas","postDate":"1156866953","msgId":16925,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MkQzMDZELTkwMTQtNDUzOS1BRkM0LTFGRTUxNUIxNkY1RkBibHVleW9uZGVyLmNvLnVrPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16929,"prevInTime":16924,"nextInTime":16926,"topicId":16925,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I have 4 children (aged 19 to 6), and have lost a child two times in the last 19 years.
