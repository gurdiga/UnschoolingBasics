It&#39;s been<br/>\ndriving my wife crazy, but discussing it, she realized that she never<br/>\nhad limits on candy growing up.  She also never had tv limits, and to<br/>\nthis day, the tv at Grandma&#39;s is almost always on.  Plus, the boys are<br/>\nboth eating as well as they ever did.<br/>\nMy youngest has been eating candy like crazy, and has actually eaten<br/>\nup the stash.  There is a small pile of Tootsie Pops which he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nseem to like.  He ate all his leftover Halloween candy.  Today, he ate<br/>\na tiny bit of breakfast and just now brought me pop ice number five. <br/>\nHowever, he found a sucker he does want on the way to bring me the pop<br/>\nice.  I have thrown away almost as much candy he&#39;s eaten, unwanted<br/>\nsuckers left on coasters or the table.  A couple days ago I had left<br/>\nhis lunch plate on the table, and it collected any amount of unwanted<br/>\ncandy.  He kept trying the peppermint patties, but several of them got<br/>\ntossed missing one little bite.  I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at opening<br/>\nthe Pez just right so that the whole stack slides right into Chewbacca.<br/>\nWatching tv whenever we want has meant that in the last few days I<br/>\ncould have watched some of my own favorite movies, though I was busy<br/>\nelsewhere while the boys watched.  My wife got to sit and watch My<br/>\nNeighbor Totoro with our youngest while I fixed breakfast this<br/>\nmorning. I wonder what Reid will pick when Evan finishes playing<br/>\nSpider Man.<br/>\nI can see our attitudes slowly changing for the better.  I can see<br/>\nthat my oldest son is a little unsure right now.  I talked to him last<br/>\nnight about all of us changing our attitude.  I explained that we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen treating each other pretty poorly and that we all need to work<br/>\ntogether to change.  I think my own stress currently is realizing how<br/>\nmy attitudes were responsible for the tenseness around the house,<br/>\nbecause I had pretty outrageous expectations not so long ago.  I kind<br/>\nof feel like I was creating this really angry monster.  <br/>\nThe current mood around the house speaks for my efforts.  Our (me and<br/>\nmy oldest) bedtime is kind of messed up lately.  He&#39;s been staying up<br/>\nreally late, and I&#39;m not sure how comfortable I am with just letting<br/>\nhim be up by himself.  He&#39;s seven.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  So I<br/>\nsit up late and sleep later.  I&#39;m used to restaurant hours, so it&#39;s<br/>\nnot that big a deal except for getting up.  I will sleep through the<br/>\nalarm clock unless I know I have to be at work, and I feel guilty if I<br/>\nsleep &quot;too late.&quot;  My wife works odd/long hours, so lifting bedtime<br/>\nlimits has actually given her more time with the boys.  <br/>\nThis started out about candy and turned into a report of sorts.  I<br/>\napologize to anyone that read this far for having bored you to tears.<br/>\n I&#39;ll try not to do it again.  I really should be moving on to the<br/>\nhousework.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9486,"nextTopicId":9662}}
