So <br/>\nI thought about this thread last night, when I completely blew it and <br/>\nbehaved not at ALL like the mom I wish I always was. (How&#39;s that for a <br/>\nconvoluted sentence? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Rosie had a long active day yesterday - up early to ride <br/>\nhorses and then hours at the county fair and then back to the stables <br/>\nto wash ponies and then to a movie with a friend and then a long drive <br/>\nwith me to pick up her sister -- during that time she didn&#39;t eat much - <br/>\njust cocoa and a rice crispy treat in the morning and some food at the <br/>\nfair, I didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d eaten there, but food is expensive <br/>\nthere, so not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home and Cyrus had barbequed and so we had a nice dinner waiting <br/>\nfor us. Rosie was cranky and irritable over little things. I knew (we <br/>\nall knew) she needed to eat something and she&#39;d be back to her <br/>\nrelatively cheerful self, but she was really being hard to get along <br/>\nwith. Finally, when we&#39;d just sat down and  Roxana asked her to pass <br/>\nsomething, Rosie didn&#39;t like the way she asked and she sort of tossed <br/>\nit at her across the table, in a hostile way. I lost my patience and <br/>\nsaid, &#39;Rosie, just go in another room for a few minutes and come back <br/>\nwhen you can be nicer.&quot; Which isn&#39;t a terrible thing to say but I said <br/>\nit in a very exasperated tone of voice. She burst into tears and ran <br/>\noff yelling, &quot;Mommy you&#39;re mad at me for being cranky because I&#39;m SO <br/>\nhungry and now you sent me away from the food and if I don&#39;t eat I&#39;m <br/>\njust going to feel worse and how is that going to help me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole mess was really a result of not planning ahead well enough. I <br/>\ncould have given her more money, just in case she was away so long. I <br/>\ncould have thought ahead and brought a snack when I picked her up from <br/>\nthe movie since I knew we were going to have to be in the car for an <br/>\nhour or so, picking up her sister. I could have stopped and bought food <br/>\nfor her after picking her up - and made Roxana wait a little longer. I <br/>\ncould have handed her a piece of cheese or something the minute we <br/>\nwalked in the door, instead of her waiting while we set the table and <br/>\nall sat down to dinner together.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one of my best parenting episodes.  But I&#39;ll be more conscious and <br/>\ncareful of the food thing. And so will she, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, she came back, still grouchy, but quiet. She ate and felt <br/>\nbetter and by the end of the meal we were having a perfectly good time. <br/>\nAfterwards we were all watching Masterpiece Theater and she fell asleep <br/>\nand is still sleeping right now - over 11 hours later. She was not just <br/>\nhungry, she was worn out, too, apparently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

As a result, we try to control OTHERS to <br/>\nlimit their impact on us. This is modelled for us all through <br/>\nchildhood. Why doesn&#39;t it work when we get to be the adult/parent?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned that I can only set boundaries for myself. I can not <br/>\nset boundaries for others. If someone wants to do something, even my <br/>\n3 y/o, it is his life to experience. Unless it will PROBABLY send him <br/>\nto the emergency room, I give him full and emphatic information if I <br/>\ndisagree. But am not angry when he chooses to do it his way, whatever <br/>\nit is. He listens to my advice, usually, and we both learn something <br/>\nwhen he doesn&#39;t. Many times my concerns were unfounded. I also have <br/>\nlearned not to overly dramatize the situation because I might end up <br/>\nlooking like I gave bad information. I want to remain a reliable <br/>\nresource that he is comfortable seeking information from.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I have opinions and share them, especially with my friends <br/>\nand family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri-<br/>\n-lee@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been reading for awhile now and really appreciate all of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your efforts<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to help us learn about unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting <br/>\n </span></blockquote>go.

I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>as good.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat <br/>\n </span></blockquote>certain<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only <br/>\n </span></blockquote>has had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>screaming and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; hysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>hitting<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not respond<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yesterday it<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; dawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>even more.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Later when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thought<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>agreed. So<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; today when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even <br/>\n </span></blockquote>more. I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; find this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>there<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>acknowledge<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she eats<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she is in a different place. This has only started since I have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>relaxed a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the way<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there <br/>\n </span></blockquote>was<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>decide&quot; and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tonight, we<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trips she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; has packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have <br/>\n </span></blockquote>just<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; helped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>\n&gt; temperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + <br/>\n </span></blockquote>(Celsius) so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; summer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; closet. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out <br/>\n </span></blockquote>her<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; velvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; quite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>tops? So she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>am sorry<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in <br/>\n </span></blockquote>this<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; weather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; learned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>\n&gt; unreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>guess the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to I will<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for <br/>\n </span></blockquote>herself<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>message I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>isn&#39;t good.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So how do I figure out what to do about this? In the end she took <br/>\n </span></blockquote>the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can <br/>\n </span></blockquote>actually<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wear it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rather<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her do what she wants but without my help.

My son and I discovered quite some time ago <br/>\nthat he gets very aggressive if he eats foods with food coloring in <br/>\nthem - slurpie for example.  He&#39;s very good about policing himself.  <br/>\nHere&#39;s how he does it - on days we&#39;re heading out to the park or <br/>\nwhere he&#39;s looking at a good amount of time outside where he can run <br/>\nand play, he&#39;ll treat himself beforehand to a slurpie or something.  <br/>\nIf he can play it off, it works out.  If it&#39;s a quieter time at <br/>\nhome, he&#39;ll avoid the food coloring because he knows he&#39;ll be <br/>\nbouncing off the walls and be miserable.  So yes, food coloring <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t agree with him.  But he&#39;s aware and rather than completely <br/>\ndenying himself treats, he splurges a couple times a week when he <br/>\nknows he&#39;ll be in an environment that allows for massive energy.  <br/>\nSome would tell me &#39;shame on you for letting him have that food <br/>\ncoloring that makes him wild&#39;... but I think he handles it quite <br/>\nwell and don&#39;t think it&#39;s causing any long term negative effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s in any way applicable to your situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

He is much<br/>\nmore likely to come over and ask for some than he is to eat if I suggest<br/>\nit.  He&#39;s 4 so he is not very receptive to my suggestions lately!  At a<br/>\nrestaurant he will often say he doesn&#39;t want to eat anything so I&#39;ll<br/>\ntell him that&#39;s fine, he doesn&#39;t have to but then I&#39;ll be sure to order<br/>\nsomething extra that I know he likes and I&#39;ll say it&#39;s &quot;in case the baby<br/>\nwants some&quot;.

My friend&#39;s daughter changes several times a day too and it cracks<br/>\nme up!  Fortunately for me Scotty has very few opinions about his<br/>\nclothes so it hasn&#39;t been an issue.  I think it might be in my future<br/>\nthough, because Eliza (who is 1 tomorrow) has already shown a lot of<br/>\ninterest in clothes.  She gets into my bottom dresser drawer, which has<br/>\nshirts in it, and puts them on!<br/>\n<br/>\n[[Next time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in -<br/>\nwithout<br/>\ncomment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather<br/>\nappropriate<br/>\nadditional items in your suitcase.]]<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what I do.  I let Scotty make his own decision about<br/>\nwhether to wear a jacket, shoes, etc but then have the jacket or shoes<br/>\nin my bag in case he changes his mind.  I have no interest in &quot;teaching<br/>\nhim a lesson&quot; by letting him freeze.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[[[There is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in<br/>\nthe<br/>\noutcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have<br/>\nstrewed.<br/>\nIt means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>\nrather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.]]]<br/>\n<br/>\nPracticing this has been so important to me and it extends far beyond<br/>\nparenting!  It is helping my relationship with my husband a lot!  I come<br/>\nfrom a long line of control freaks so letting go has been so very hard<br/>\nfor me.  What has been helping me lately is focusing on joy in my<br/>\ninteractions with the world.

I work in the health field and see the cost<br/>\nof eating the wrong things far too often. I did make lots of offers of food,<br/>\nshe had food that she chose, prepared the way she liked it on a plate beside<br/>\nher which she then ignored. Not sure what else I could have done. Something<br/>\nnew for me is being 6 months pregnant and being with her, I have to eat more<br/>\noften and on the two days we had this issue, I had finished my food and was<br/>\nalready for my next snack and she hadn&#39;t finished her first food and then<br/>\nwould move onto my second choice, which in hindsight was not as healthy as I<br/>\nshould have made. BUT because she had not eaten enough of the healthier<br/>\nchoices, she reacted more strongly to the unhealthy choices in her body than<br/>\nshe might have regularly. Ok. so I learned something there.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe clothes, well. I stopped having a say in her clothes (mostly) when she<br/>\nwas about a year and a half. She wanted to choose. I struggled with some<br/>\nchoices but have really gotten to the place where what she wears is ok with<br/>\nme. Even two different socks because she can&#39;t choose are fun in my eyes<br/>\nnow. She has an eclectic style that I enjoy. Unfortunately, that day I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t thought of just packing some more appropriate things for her in my<br/>\ncase as well. (a DUH moment) but now have that thought tucked away for the<br/>\nfuture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that it was 36-38 all weekend long she spent most of her time in her<br/>\nbathing suit in the pool and the sprinkler. And I was so proud of myself<br/>\nthat when I couldn&#39;t take the heat anymore and all the judgmental &quot;adults&quot;<br/>\nof my family were sitting around talking and doing adult things. I put on my<br/>\nsuit and went out and held her hand and ran and squealed through the<br/>\nsprinkler with her for 30 minutes. I will never forget the look in her face<br/>\nwhen she was doing it with me. she LOVED that I did it with her and I<br/>\nenjoyed it too. That night when we did our &quot;what was your favourite part of<br/>\nthe day&quot; question, we both said running through the sprinkler together.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nA great memory:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Steven Cox [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:slclsc@...\">slclsc@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, July 15, 2004 11:45 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] help letting go<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s alot to be said for the conventional wisdom of dressing for the<br/>\nweather and eating nutritious foods. And young children need and want<br/>\nparents advice about such things--unless they have been accustomed to having<br/>\npower struggles with the parent over clothes and food or have never had to<br/>\nmake decisions for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are virtually as many theories about food as their are people, it<br/>\nseems to me :-) (vegetarian is best, or omnivorous is best, or paleolithic<br/>\nis best, or low fat is best, or high fat is best or organic is best or low<br/>\ncarb is best and on and on). I have had a change in my health and have been<br/>\nresearching food theories, and find alot of conflicting info. Anyway, it<br/>\nmight be good to think that you and your child(ren) are exploring food,<br/>\nfinding what works best for them and you. If a child is losing it &#39;cause<br/>\nshe&#39;s over hungry, chances are she wasn&#39;t offered food soon enough. Or food<br/>\nthat she likes in a way that she likes it. Its ok to suggest eating and what<br/>\nto eat--its how you do it that&#39;s so important. Sometimes it helps me to<br/>\nthink of my kids as guests in my house--because then I know how to talk to<br/>\nthem respectfully. Its sad, but true, for me it is easier to talk<br/>\nrespectfully to someone else&#39;s children, especially when I&#39;m stressed. Also<br/>\nits important to not get mad at her if s <br/>\nThe whole packing thing could have been so fun. Her choices were great. Lots<br/>\nof people overpack and choose the wrong clothes.  Shorts and t-shirts are<br/>\nsmall. She could have found out what fit in the suitcase or bag that she<br/>\nwanted to bring. Sometimes, parents are embarassed by their kids choices in<br/>\nclothes or whatever. I love them! But I would get embarassed if I was with a<br/>\nchild with snarly hair or something. Whatever you think is good, like<br/>\nmatching clothes or combed hair, you can show your child using yourself as<br/>\nan example. But be happy if they choose otherwise. Children are often<br/>\nattracted to what makes us happy. I&#39;m not saying this to manipulate children<br/>\ninto doing what we want; but if what we want is genuinely a good idea, the<br/>\nenthusiasm we have for it is quite contagious.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shift toward happiness and letting go can be really hard for a parent<br/>\nwho is used to giving dour directives. I&#39;m not saying this is you (I&#39;m<br/>\nsaying it is/was me--I keep working on it :-))<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sherri-Lee Pressman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 1:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] help letting go<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been reading for awhile now and really appreciate all of your<br/>\nefforts<br/>\n  to help us learn about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting go. Not<br/>\na<br/>\n  big surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>\n  ideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening<br/>\nfor<br/>\n  us, was that I let go off too many things at once and not only did my dd<br/>\n  feel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>\n  parenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>\n  like some of you ladies have. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n  I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>\n  foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>\n  hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>\n  food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>\n  hysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>\n  and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not<br/>\nrespond<br/>\n  in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. Yesterday<br/>\nit<br/>\n  dawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me even<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n  Later when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she<br/>\nthought<br/>\n  she had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she agreed. So<br/>\n  today when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even more. I<br/>\n  find this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if there<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed to<br/>\n  accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t acknowledge<br/>\n  it? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as she eats<br/>\n  she is in a different place. This has only started since I have relaxed a<br/>\n  bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to the way<br/>\n  it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there was<br/>\n  healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>\nand<br/>\n  then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like tonight,<br/>\nwe<br/>\n  are getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few trips<br/>\nshe<br/>\n  has packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have just<br/>\n  helped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>\n  temperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + (Celsius)<br/>\nso<br/>\n  summer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of her<br/>\n  closet. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out her<br/>\n  velvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\n  quite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and tops? So<br/>\nshe<br/>\n  pulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I am<br/>\nsorry<br/>\n  I just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in this<br/>\n  weather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well and<br/>\n  learned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>\n  unreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try to<br/>\n  leave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I guess the<br/>\n  message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I<br/>\nwill<br/>\n  leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for<br/>\nherself<br/>\n  but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>\n  am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\ngood.<br/>\n  So how do I figure out what to do about this? In the end she took the<br/>\n  leotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can actually<br/>\n  wear it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>\n  wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>\n  her do what she wants but without my help. Is the goal to be without<br/>\n  opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read.<br/>\nBut<br/>\n  so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to<br/>\nbe<br/>\n  with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>\n  bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just feel so frustrated by all this. any thoughts or suggestions? Oh and<br/>\n  be gentle please:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks in advance, oh and we are away this weekend, so I might not respond<br/>\n  too quickly, but I appreciate all suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n  Need safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

So <br/>\nI thought about this thread last night, when I completely blew it and <br/>\nbehaved not at ALL like the mom I wish I always was. (How&#39;s that for a <br/>\nconvoluted sentence? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - Rosie had a long active day yesterday - up early to ride <br/>\nhorses and then hours at the county fair and then back to the stables <br/>\nto wash ponies and then to a movie with a friend and then a long drive <br/>\nwith me to pick up her sister -- during that time she didn&#39;t eat much - <br/>\njust cocoa and a rice crispy treat in the morning and some food at the <br/>\nfair, I didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d eaten there, but food is expensive <br/>\nthere, so not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got home and Cyrus had barbequed and so we had a nice dinner waiting <br/>\nfor us. Rosie was cranky and irritable over little things. I knew (we <br/>\nall knew) she needed to eat something and she&#39;d be back to her <br/>\nrelatively cheerful self, but she was really being hard to get along <br/>\nwith. Finally, when we&#39;d just sat down and  Roxana asked her to pass <br/>\nsomething, Rosie didn&#39;t like the way she asked and she sort of tossed <br/>\nit at her across the table, in a hostile way. I lost my patience and <br/>\nsaid, &#39;Rosie, just go in another room for a few minutes and come back <br/>\nwhen you can be nicer.&quot; Which isn&#39;t a terrible thing to say but I said <br/>\nit in a very exasperated tone of voice. She burst into tears and ran <br/>\noff yelling, &quot;Mommy you&#39;re mad at me for being cranky because I&#39;m SO <br/>\nhungry and now you sent me away from the food and if I don&#39;t eat I&#39;m <br/>\njust going to feel worse and how is that going to help me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole mess was really a result of not planning ahead well enough. I <br/>\ncould have given her more money, just in case she was away so long. I <br/>\ncould have thought ahead and brought a snack when I picked her up from <br/>\nthe movie since I knew we were going to have to be in the car for an <br/>\nhour or so, picking up her sister. I could have stopped and bought food <br/>\nfor her after picking her up - and made Roxana wait a little longer. I <br/>\ncould have handed her a piece of cheese or something the minute we <br/>\nwalked in the door, instead of her waiting while we set the table and <br/>\nall sat down to dinner together.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot one of my best parenting episodes.  But I&#39;ll be more conscious and <br/>\ncareful of the food thing. And so will she, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, she came back, still grouchy, but quiet. She ate and felt <br/>\nbetter and by the end of the meal we were having a perfectly good time. <br/>\nAfterwards we were all watching Masterpiece Theater and she fell asleep <br/>\nand is still sleeping right now - over 11 hours later. She was not just <br/>\nhungry, she was worn out, too, apparently.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNational Home Education Network<br/>\n&lt;www.NHEN.org&gt;<br/>\nServing the entire homeschooling community since 1999<br/>\nthrough information, networking and public relations.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129294861,"authorName":"christy_imnotred","from":"&quot;christy_imnotred&quot; &lt;christy_imnotred@...&gt;","profile":"christy_imnotred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help letting go","postDate":"1090073883","msgId":2191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkYmNlcit0dTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNkYmFhbSthb25lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2189,"nextInTopic":2206,"prevInTime":2190,"nextInTime":2192,"topicId":2127,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... year ...

I felt trapped. When he screams (i.e. is EMPHATIC) for <br/>\nsomething, I felt he was demanding NOW, or else. The &quot;trapped&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;or else&quot; are my baggage from childhood. Seeing a counselor has <br/>\nhelped me to identify the origin of these strong reactions that I <br/>\nintellectually realized were out of proportion to my young child&#39;s <br/>\nbehavior. In childhood I had a prevasive feeling of being controlled, <br/>\ntrapped and punished for non-compliance. And screaming used to <br/>\nprecede punishment in my childhood home. So I immediately felt <br/>\nthreatened. Does any of this sound familiar?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feelings were left over from not dealing with these strong <br/>\nchildhood feelings that were unable to be expressed at that time. <br/>\nThey needed to be expressed so they kept coming to the surface <br/>\nunexpectedly. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur children do push our buttons, they don&#39;t know they are our <br/>\nbuttons until we let them know. Sometimes my reaction is such a <br/>\ncuriousity for my son that he keeps trying to discover the nuances of <br/>\nmy reaction. Sometimes, I still must restrain my anger by breathing <br/>\nand focusing on the now and the moment, not my past. Over time my <br/>\nreaction has settled to a more comfortable angst at being grabbed <br/>\nunexpectly and then I try to consciously choose to hold him at that <br/>\ntime. It helps me to feel less &quot;trapped&quot; and helps to soothe my <br/>\ninternal flame. Also, I have found it helps me if I kneel down to his <br/>\nlevel and whisper to him when he yells for things. He usually lowers <br/>\nhis voice. So that I feel more control over my own reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; <br/>\n&lt;dezigna@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t wait for her to ask for food, never have.

I always am offering<br/>\nand<br/>\nhave lots of healthy choice snacks available to her all day. We have the<br/>\nbottom shelf in the fridge with just food that is prepped and easy for her<br/>\nto just grab and eat. Same with a shelf in the pantry. She had lots of food<br/>\nnear her all day, she had just chosen to eat not enough of it and it caught<br/>\nup to her. She had not finished the breakfast she asked for, or the lunch<br/>\nthat she asked for, but she did drink all her slurpie, so she had more sugar<br/>\nthan other nutrients in her body and I believe this was part of the problem.<br/>\nShe had food on a plate beside her but was not eating it. So that is where<br/>\nmy confusion and frustration came in in that situation.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to guess that it is partly getting used to her new freedom, and<br/>\npartly a self-experiment thing. Others have suggested waiting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess letting her know that she seems to be getting grumpy will help her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not sure what I have to do about this, but I can&#39;t imagine hugging<br/>\nher or nursing her when she is like that. I immediately get SO angry and<br/>\nresentful of her screaming at me, that I have a hard time staying. My first<br/>\ninstinct is to just walk away and remove myself from that situation.  Of<br/>\ncourse she is screaming &quot;come here come here&quot; so I guess I will have to find<br/>\na way to do that for her.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she is out of control is when she most needs you to come nearer and be<br/>\nloving and acceptant. Walking away is better than punishing her - if YOU<br/>\nfeel like you are going to lose it. However if you can see her as at her<br/>\nMOST vunerable, and most needy, at these times and stay close, you will both<br/>\nfeel better. Again try &quot;detachment&quot; and mirroring her feelings to her. <br/>\n&quot;You are crying and thrashing, you must feel angry.&quot; Or &quot;Are you mad<br/>\nbecause....[best guess]&quot; I&#39;m not suggesting you insert &quot;you&#39;re hungry&quot; here,<br/>\nbut the actual physical event that set her off. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe may surprise you by coming back to &quot;no, I&#39;m feeling hungry&quot; after a<br/>\nwhile, or give you some insights into her feelings that may lead back to the<br/>\nfood coloring issue that someone mentioned. Sometimes children have<br/>\ndescribed reactions like &quot;feeling itchy inside&quot;, or suddenly &quot;scared&quot; of the<br/>\nintensity of their feelings, that have turned out to be pointers to food<br/>\nallergies.(Message boards archives). In my case, once Jayn was able to tell<br/>\nme that I &quot;didn&#39;t really want to understand&quot;, and I realized that she was<br/>\nright and it was a great lesson to me - both about myself and about her<br/>\npowers of perception and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;OK.

I learned to detach around significant others when a <br/>\nguy I was friends with got really mad and started causing a scene in <br/>\npublic. People kept giving me dirty looks, but he wasn&#39;t my boyfriend <br/>\nor even a close friend, so I _felt_ pretty detached! Then it occured <br/>\nto me that I could still feel that way even if it was a boyfriend or <br/>\nhusband who was misbehaving.<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee, it&#39;s really hard. I decided I wanted to control less, but <br/>\nthen the next stage seemed to be manipulating, being a martyr (okay, <br/>\nif you don&#39;t want to help me, I&#39;ll clean up by myself...), getting <br/>\nupset at the choices, etc. It&#39;s taking longer to really let go. Two <br/>\nsteps forward, one back. And two steps back, then two more steps <br/>\nback, lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the sugar issue, hmmm, how can I put this? You see that <br/>\nthe &quot;bad&quot; food is leading to misbehavior, but is seeing this helping <br/>\nyou two, or is it making you tense, waiting for the acting out? What <br/>\nif you just look directly at her and not think about what happened in <br/>\nthe past to lead to this behavior and what to do to prevent it in the <br/>\nfuture and how to recover from it. Just look at her and see her as <br/>\nthe little girl you love and try to figure out what you can do to <br/>\nhelp her in the moment. Of course this is much easier before she <br/>\nstarts screaming! So yeh, it may be hunger and low blood sugar, but <br/>\nthe bigger issue is your relationship. And on the way to her eating <br/>\nwhat her body needs, she&#39;s going to have some mis-steps. <br/>\n<br/>\nMikey and I had a really bad day yesterday. MIL is here and I made an <br/>\nappointment to get the kids pictures taken. It took forever to get <br/>\nCaroline to smile so poor Mikey had to sit there being told smile, <br/>\nlook over here, stop baring your teeth, etc. Then we had to kill 1.5 <br/>\nhours in the mall...I had no energy, no patience and was feeling very <br/>\nanxious over EVERYTHING (like what you mentioned--pg depression <br/>\ncoming out as anger, etc.). I was evil. Today he started the day <br/>\nfighting me and I just said &quot;I&#39;m not arguing today&quot; and refused to <br/>\nlet him get to me. After a few hours of goading me, he understood and <br/>\nwe had a perfectly wonderful time. Drove dh and MIL insane playing <br/>\nthe question game in the car (everything you say has to be a <br/>\nquestion...if the other person answers, they lose) and laughing <br/>\nhysterically.<br/>\n<br/>\nUgh, I gotta go pack.

Why doesn&#39;t it work when we get to be the adult/parent?!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned that I can only set boundaries for myself. I can not <br/>\nset boundaries for others. If someone wants to do something, even my <br/>\n3 y/o, it is his life to experience. Unless it will PROBABLY send him <br/>\nto the emergency room, I give him full and emphatic information if I <br/>\ndisagree. But am not angry when he chooses to do it his way, whatever <br/>\nit is. He listens to my advice, usually, and we both learn something <br/>\nwhen he doesn&#39;t. Many times my concerns were unfounded.

Brainstorm with her about how  <br/>\nthey can be prevented.  Can she choose foods with less sugar?  Can she  ask<br/>\nyou <br/>\nto make her a scrambled egg to go along with the sugary cereal?   These<br/>\nthings <br/>\nhave to be done way before the pattern emerges that leads to the  behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think back over the last few days you shoudl be able to  be notice a <br/>\npattern of time between something sugary or nothing since waking, to  when<br/>\nthe <br/>\ntantrum occurs.

We used to have hungry uglies after donuts for breakfast,<br/>\nvery <br/>\npredictable.  After I figured it out, it was easy to suggest  that he have<br/>\nan <br/>\negg or a slice of bacon with his donut.  Since he  liked eggs and bacon, and<br/>\n<br/>\nunderstood the problem he was having (even at 3 or 4,  he understood it in <br/>\nsimple terms) and he didn&#39;t like it, he&#39;d usually eat a  little.  He&#39;d eat<br/>\nless <br/>\ndonut, too, because he was full faster.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of preventing meltdowns is seeing them coming and distracting or  <br/>\ntaking other steps.  These hunger related meltdowns can be lessened in the<br/>\nsame <br/>\nway, without controlling her food choices.  Unschooled kids are not  living<br/>\nin a <br/>\nvacuum of relationship.  We interact with them to help  them get what they <br/>\nneed and they learn from their choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I always am offering and<br/>\nhave lots of healthy choice snacks available to her all day. We have the<br/>\nbottom shelf in the fridge with just food that is prepped and easy for her<br/>\nto just grab and eat. Same with a shelf in the pantry. She had lots of food<br/>\nnear her all day, she had just chosen to eat not enough of it and it caught<br/>\nup to her. She had not finished the breakfast she asked for, or the lunch<br/>\nthat she asked for, but she did drink all her slurpie, so she had more sugar<br/>\nthan other nutrients in her body and I believe this was part of the problem.<br/>\nShe had food on a plate beside her but was not eating it. So that is where<br/>\nmy confusion and frustration came in in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>\n<br/>\nand just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>\n<br/>\nin kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Jayn does this, I tend to hold her gently at arms length - to save my<br/>\n<br/>\nface - and I tell her fairly forcefully to take some deep breaths. Sometimes<br/>\n<br/>\nworks. We are still nursing, so that also helps - both with becoming calm<br/>\n<br/>\nand getting some good food in. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure what I have to do about this, but I can&#39;t imagine hugging her<br/>\nor nursing her when she is like that. I immediately get SO angry and<br/>\nresentful of her screaming at me, that I have a hard time staying. My first<br/>\ninstinct is to just walk away and remove myself from that situation.  Of<br/>\ncourse she is screaming &quot;come here come here&quot; so I guess I will have to find<br/>\na way to do that for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really great that you are grasping this about yourself. It is hard to<br/>\n<br/>\nlook at yourself and admit imperfections.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am rarely unwilling to look at my own imperfections. DH says it is<br/>\nsomething he admires about me:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So I guess the<br/>\n<br/>\nmessage she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>\n<br/>\nleave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>\n<br/>\nbut really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>\n<br/>\nam sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\n<br/>\ngood.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* good that you are seeing it, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial, especially<br/>\n<br/>\nin comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing.

She often combines her princess type dress up clothes in creative<br/>\n<br/>\nand ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>\n<br/>\nseveral times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I do,<br/>\n<br/>\nand often wears her leotards as clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is trivial. I was really surprised since she has been picking her<br/>\nown clothes since she was 2 years old and has made some creative choices but<br/>\nhas never chosen hot winter clothes for summer wear before. And since she<br/>\nruns hot most of the time I could just see us dealing with a screaming<br/>\nunhappy kid in the heat this weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNext time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in - without<br/>\n<br/>\ncomment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather appropriate<br/>\n<br/>\nadditional items in your suitcase. Do this every time until the trust<br/>\n<br/>\nbetween you is restored and she is ready to ask you for advice on what to<br/>\n<br/>\npack. Be prepared to be cheerful if it&#39;s rejected if she deems your ideas<br/>\n<br/>\nless worthy than her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good idea and I will work on it. Much easier than the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in the<br/>\n<br/>\noutcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have strewed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>\n<br/>\nrather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes, I need to work on that BIG TIME!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>\n<br/>\nwants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>\n<br/>\nher do what she wants but without my help.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is exactly helping children to do what they want, with as much<br/>\n<br/>\nhelp as they ask for, of the kind they ask for, including simple<br/>\n<br/>\nunconditional encouragement. If you don&#39;t want to help her, you will find it<br/>\n<br/>\nharder to unschool as she ages.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is the goal to be without<br/>\n<br/>\nopinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read. But<br/>\n<br/>\nso if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to be<br/>\n<br/>\nwith you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>\n<br/>\nbit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we help but have opinions? They are not the same as making<br/>\n<br/>\njudgments. We can choose how to express them - and more importantly if we<br/>\n<br/>\nshould express them at all. Will the opinion you express increase your<br/>\n<br/>\nlittle girl&#39;s confidence in herself and trust in you? If no, then I suggest<br/>\n<br/>\nbiting your tongue. Is it a life and limb threatening safety issue? That&#39;s a<br/>\n<br/>\nmore reasonable thing to express your *unasked for* opinion about.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOK. more work. having opinions I don&#39;t share good luck!

So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>\nlike some of you ladies have.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people feel gradually is better. In terms of food it is just saying<br/>\n&quot;yes&quot; more and more often rather than making a &quot;declaration&quot; of some kind. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Like food.

If there are sliced apples, and bowls of nuts,<br/>\nand ham rolls, and cubed cheese, and so on, immediately available that may<br/>\nbe easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>\nand just pushing me.

Sometimes<br/>\nworks. We are still nursing, so that also helps - both with becoming calm<br/>\nand getting some good food in. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot;<br/>\nand then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really great that you are grasping this about yourself. It is hard to<br/>\nlook at yourself and admit imperfections.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So I guess the<br/>\nmessage she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>\nleave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>\nbut really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>\nam sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\ngood.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *is* good that you are seeing it, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly this stuff about the clothes to pack is beyond trivial, especially<br/>\nin comparison to the control issue behind it that you are seeing. If it<br/>\nmakes it easier for you to let go I&#39;ll tell you this: Jayn often wears her<br/>\nwinter clothes in summer (SoCal) - amazing me with her ability to stay cool<br/>\nanyway. She often combines her princess type dress up clothes in creative<br/>\nand ridiculous seeming ways that end up looking cool. She also changes<br/>\nseveral times in a day, and takes (a lot) longer to make choices than I do,<br/>\nand often wears her leotards as clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time help her fold and pack what she wants to and will fit in - without<br/>\ncomment or editorializing. Then quietly pack a few more weather appropriate<br/>\nadditional items in your suitcase. Do this every time until the trust<br/>\nbetween you is restored and she is ready to ask you for advice on what to<br/>\npack. Be prepared to be cheerful if it&#39;s rejected if she deems your ideas<br/>\nless worthy than her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an idea called &quot;Detachment&quot; - having no emotional stake in the<br/>\noutcome of such things as advice, or suggestions, or stuff you have strewed.<br/>\nIt means that you can just not be worried if the advice etc is rejected,<br/>\nrather than taking it as a personal rejection of *you*.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>\nwants AND wants me to help her do it.

And young children need and want parents","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-374322138\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s alot to be said for the conventional wisdom of dressing for the weather and eating nutritious foods. And young children need and want parents advice about such things--unless they have been accustomed to having power struggles with the parent over clothes and food or have never had to make decisions for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are virtually as many theories about food as their are people, it seems to me :-) (vegetarian is best, or omnivorous is best, or paleolithic is best, or low fat is best, or high fat is best or organic is best or low carb is best and on and on). I have had a change in my health and have been researching food theories, and find alot of conflicting info. Anyway, it might be good to think that you and your child(ren) are exploring food, finding what works best for them and you. If a child is losing it &#39;cause she&#39;s over hungry, chances are she wasn&#39;t offered food soon enough. Or food that she likes in a way that she likes it. Its ok to suggest eating and what to eat--its how you do it that&#39;s so important. Sometimes it helps me to think of my kids as guests in my house--because then I know how to talk to them respectfully. Its sad, but true, for me it is easier to talk respectfully to someone else&#39;s children, especially when I&#39;m stressed. Also its important to not get mad at her if she forgets to eat and gets overwhelmed. BTW, I&#39;ve seen really happy kids, hardly eat at all for most of the day and then chow down at dinner. Hungry does not have to =unhappy. Its best to have a full tummy, of course, but stress and feeling coerced is what causes most melt-downs. She likely will make mistakes, like eating too much sweets or simple carbs and end up not feeling so good. IME kids usually self correct for this. When you&#39;re grocery shopping, or eating, its ok to comment on nutrition, but it shouldn&#39;t be harping or judgemental. Food is for nourishment, I think, but enjoying the whole experience of eating is what its all about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole packing thing could have been so fun. Her choices were great. Lots of people overpack and choose the wrong clothes.  Shorts and t-shirts are small. She could have found out what fit in the suitcase or bag that she wanted to bring. Sometimes, parents are embarassed by their kids choices in clothes or whatever. I love them! But I would get embarassed if I was with a child with snarly hair or something. Whatever you think is good, like matching clothes or combed hair, you can show your child using yourself as an example. But be happy if they choose otherwise. Children are often attracted to what makes us happy. I&#39;m not saying this to manipulate children into doing what we want; but if what we want is genuinely a good idea, the enthusiasm we have for it is quite contagious.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shift toward happiness and letting go can be really hard for a parent who is used to giving dour directives. I&#39;m not saying this is you (I&#39;m saying it is/was me--I keep working on it :-))<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sherri-Lee Pressman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 1:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] help letting go<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have been reading for awhile now and really appreciate all of your efforts<br/>\n  to help us learn about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So now I have some questions, I seem to be struggling with letting go. Not a<br/>\n  big surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>\n  ideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening for<br/>\n  us, was that I let go off too many things at once and not only did my dd<br/>\n  feel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>\n  parenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>\n  like some of you ladies have. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as good.<br/>\n  I have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>\n  foods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>\n  hungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>\n  food lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>\n  hysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>\n  and just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>\n  in kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. Yesterday it<br/>\n  dawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me even more.<br/>\n  Later when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she thought<br/>\n  she had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she agreed. So<br/>\n  today when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even more. I<br/>\n  find this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if there<br/>\n  wasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed to<br/>\n  accept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t acknowledge<br/>\n  it? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as she eats<br/>\n  she is in a different place. This has only started since I have relaxed a<br/>\n  bit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to the way<br/>\n  it was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there was<br/>\n  healthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot; and<br/>\n  then I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like tonight, we<br/>\n  are getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few trips she<br/>\n  has packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have just<br/>\n  helped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>\n  temperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + (Celsius) so<br/>\n  summer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of her<br/>\n  closet. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out her<br/>\n  velvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\n  quite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and tops? So she<br/>\n  pulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I am sorry<br/>\n  I just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in this<br/>\n  weather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well and<br/>\n  learned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>\n  unreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try to<br/>\n  leave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I guess the<br/>\n  message she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>\n  leave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>\n  but really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t get it right I will leave? Sounds like that might be the message I<br/>\n  am sending and she is reacting with panic and screaming. Ok that isn&#39;t good.<br/>\n  So how do I figure out what to do about this? In the end she took the<br/>\n  leotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can actually<br/>\n  wear it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>\n  wants AND wants me to help her do it. Does that make sense? I would rather<br/>\n  her do what she wants but without my help. Is the goal to be without<br/>\n  opinions about what she does? No I don&#39;t think so from what I have read. But<br/>\n  so if you really disagree with what they want to do but they want you to be<br/>\n  with you and help you do it, how do you draw the lines? I think that is a<br/>\n  bit of the root of my frustration. So any thoughts on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just feel so frustrated by all this. any thoughts or suggestions? Oh and<br/>\n  be gentle please:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks in advance, oh and we are away this weekend, so I might not respond<br/>\n  too quickly, but I appreciate all suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n  Need safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Not a<br/>\nbig surprise I am sure that is the way it is for many, but do you have any<br/>\nideas how to make it easier? Part of what I realized that was happening for<br/>\nus, was that I let go off too many things at once and not only did my dd<br/>\nfeel a bit like a boat adrift at sea, but I also felt really lost in my<br/>\nparenting. So some things, I know I am just not ready to totally let go of<br/>\nlike some of you ladies have. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n Like food. I can&#39;t change it yet, I see some foods as bad and some as good.<br/>\nI have tried to relax on her food issues and not push her to eat certain<br/>\nfoods first etc, but then days like today and yesterday happen and she is<br/>\nhungry and doesn&#39;t eat, until the point she is so hungry and only has had<br/>\nfood lacking in nutritional quality in her tummy that she is screaming and<br/>\nhysterical at me. I mean really horrible screaming and crying and hitting<br/>\nand just pushing me. I can&#39;t take it and it is all I can take to not respond<br/>\nin kind and I have to say I don&#39;t always manage to pull it off. Yesterday it<br/>\ndawned on me it was hunger, so I suggested it, she screamed at me even more.<br/>\nLater when she was calmer we talked about it and I asked her if she thought<br/>\nshe had been screaming at me because she was hungry, yes she agreed. So<br/>\ntoday when it started again, I suggested it and she screamed even more. I<br/>\nfind this behaviour really hard to take and unacceptable. Ok. if there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t an easy fix to it that would be different, but am I supposed to<br/>\naccept disrespectful behaviour because she is hungry and won&#39;t acknowledge<br/>\nit? That is hardly fair to anyone else in this family. As soon as she eats<br/>\nshe is in a different place. This has only started since I have relaxed a<br/>\nbit about food and I have to say I am thinking about going back to the way<br/>\nit was, which wasn&#39;t extremely rigid, but we sure made sure there was<br/>\nhealthy nutritionally dense food eaten before &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is one issue, the other thing is that I find I say &quot;ok you decide&quot; and<br/>\nthen I discover I don&#39;t mean it as much as I thought I did. Like tonight, we<br/>\nare getting ready to go away for the weekend, so for the last few trips she<br/>\nhas packed her own little strawberry shortcake suitcase and I have just<br/>\nhelped with suggests of appropriate clothing for number of days and<br/>\ntemperature. So tonight a weekend in a place that will be 30 + (Celsius) so<br/>\nsummer clothes are in. So first she takes about 25 outfits out of her<br/>\ncloset. ok that is too many things for two days. Then she takes out her<br/>\nvelvet Christmas dress and her Halloween princess costume. ok that isn&#39;t<br/>\nquite right either. How about some sun dresses, and shorts and tops? So she<br/>\npulls out a purple sleeveless top and purple winter leos. HUH???? I am sorry<br/>\nI just lost it. these are not things she chooses to wear at home in this<br/>\nweather and she knows where we are going. I didn&#39;t handle it well and<br/>\nlearned really fast that I was upset because I thought she was being<br/>\nunreasonable. So then I say ok. pack what you want go ahead and try to<br/>\nleave... well she screams at me that she wants me to stay. So I guess the<br/>\nmessage she is getting is that if she doesn&#39;t do what I expect her to I will<br/>\nleave but I am going to act like she has autonomy and can chose for herself<br/>\nbut really she doesn&#39;t and has to guess what I want from her and if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get it right I will leave?

In the end she took the<br/>\nleotards and the top and the shorts, so when we get there she can actually<br/>\nwear it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI find it hard to be in a situation where she wants to do what ever she<br/>\nwants AND wants me to help her do it.
