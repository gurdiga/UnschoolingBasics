When I teach my sling <br/>\nworkshops I always tailor my approach to the audience. I could just <br/>\nstart &quot;at the beginning&quot; and work my way through some long schpiel <br/>\nabout the benefits of wearing your baby in a sling, the different types <br/>\nof slings, etc. and I have a feeling a lot of eyes would glaze over, <br/>\nlol.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I just ask, &quot;Why are you here? What did you hope to learn about <br/>\nslings today?&quot; And sometimes the answer is surprising. People bring <br/>\nslings and other carriers that I&#39;ve never seen before (and I thought <br/>\nI&#39;d seen them all!) and we figure out together how they work. Other <br/>\ntimes people are actually interested in learning *most* of what I would <br/>\ncover in my overview, but we do it piecemeal, with them asking a <br/>\nquestion and me answering, and then they ask another question until <br/>\nthey are satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone is so different. Some just want to see me do the different <br/>\ncarries with my baby. Some want to try them with their own babies. Some <br/>\njust want to see the different types of slings, grab a handout and be <br/>\non their way. Forcing everyone to submit to the same cookie cutter <br/>\napproach doesn&#39;t fit with my philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise I feel like it&#39;s set up like &quot;I am the expert and I&#39;m going <br/>\nto drone on and on until you wish you never showed up.&quot; That&#39;s just not <br/>\nme. &lt;g&gt; Professors in college used to get so angry when students would <br/>\nfall asleep or otherwise tune out. If I were the professor I would be <br/>\nasking myself, &quot;What am I doing wrong that my students are so bored as <br/>\nto fall asleep?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 8, 2006, at 4:48 PM, Deb wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Now I&#39;m teaching that same class and I got some really confused<br/>\n&gt;  looks when I didn&#39;t hand out stickers for showing up, I didn&#39;t use a<br/>\n&gt;  Q-U-I-E-T sign to keep track of misbehaviors (and track the level of<br/>\n&gt;  punitive outcomes), I didn&#39;t even do any worksheets (I just handed<br/>\n&gt;  them out as the kids were leaving so they&#39;d have something to take<br/>\n&gt;  home).

The teacher told the kids that if they memorized all the <br/>\nrequisite verses, she&#39;d reward them with a trip to Taco Bell. For <br/>\nthe first week or two, Joshua was very into it. So we reviewed with <br/>\nhim when he wanted to and all like that. Then he only wanted to <br/>\nreview right before class, so that&#39;s what we did - we&#39;d get there <br/>\nearly so he could review for a couple minutes before the teacher <br/>\narrived so he could get his sticker for the day. Then we were gone <br/>\nfor a week (he wasn&#39;t considered responsible for the week we <br/>\nmissed). When we got back, we were confused over which one to work <br/>\non. He did the wrong one as it turned out. And got upset. And his <br/>\nteacher was gracious and told him that he could practice it and tell <br/>\nit to her later in the day or call midweek and tell her or whatever -<br/>\n she really did, within the schoolish mindset (she had also been a <br/>\npublic/private school teacher), try to give him lots of <br/>\nopportunities. But he was really upset still. So, when we got home, <br/>\nwe sat and talked about it. I asked what we should do. Did he want <br/>\nme to write it on our kitchen chalkboard each week so he could see <br/>\nit all the time? Did he want to do review games? (like jumping from <br/>\nthrow pillow to throw pillow saying the words with each jump) But he <br/>\nwas just upset. So I asked him how big an important thing was this <br/>\nto him, since we usually go out to lunch on Sundays anyhow and we <br/>\ncould easily stop at Taco Bell one day instead of anyplace else. At <br/>\nthat, he brightened up and said &quot;Yeah. We go to places I like a lot <br/>\nbetter than Taco Bell.&quot; Problem solved - he did what he wanted to <br/>\n(sometimes he memorized the verse, sometimes not) and we continued <br/>\neating at various places. And in the end the teacher took the whole <br/>\nclass to Taco Bell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m teaching that same class and I got some really confused <br/>\nlooks when I didn&#39;t hand out stickers for showing up, I didn&#39;t use a <br/>\nQ-U-I-E-T sign to keep track of misbehaviors (and track the level of <br/>\npunitive outcomes), I didn&#39;t even do any worksheets (I just handed <br/>\nthem out as the kids were leaving so they&#39;d have something to take <br/>\nhome).
