Obviously we are deschooling<br/>\nourselves big time.  My ds, 5 years, never went to school... he wants to do<br/>\nwhat he wants... not what some one else wants :-)  clue to mama... there has<br/>\ngot to be a better way... so here we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd is 2 years old.  My son is big on lego and privacy... he mostly wants<br/>\nat least 8-10 hours of time alone in a room with his lego per week!  And<br/>\nthis is new to us... and while we were moving house and country twice over<br/>\nin the past year....a easy to fix child proof gate was my solution until<br/>\nnow....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 year old is almost as tall as a 4 year old and has that kind of<br/>\nstrength as well... so she does not take kindly to the gate any more... so<br/>\nwe now let ds close the room door when he needs to.  And i made sure that i<br/>\nwould stay with my 2 year old during her sadness of being kept out.  Slowly<br/>\nshe has come to accept her brother&#39;s need for time... adn has found her own<br/>\nways to play then.  Also... we plan to give her a child&#39;s gate for our room<br/>\n(a sleep only room with some toys).. so she can control entry to that<br/>\nroom:-)  I think thats the least we can do..so she feels like she can<br/>\ncontrol access to a space like her brother can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd interestingly ds will some times come out after 10 minutes.. and play<br/>\nwith dd till she seems past her sadness and then go back in again!  how<br/>\nglorious to see them empathize and connect... i&#39;m so glad we started<br/>\nunschooling.... and parenting in an unconditional way... it allows for the<br/>\nchild to always feel safe :-) and hence empowers them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso.... when dd wants to go into ds&#39;s room... i accompany her... and show<br/>\nher how to handle lego creations or some other delicate sculpture that ds<br/>\nhas made.  Usually she is satisfied to pick up some blocks and a few lego<br/>\npieces from there and bring them into the kitchen or front room with me.<br/>\n(She has enough toys outside ds&#39;s room but is constantly thinking there must<br/>\nbe a spotted dinosaur or something in there we&#39;re hiding from her  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find something that works for both of them.<br/>\nHema<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHema A.
