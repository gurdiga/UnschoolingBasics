I&#39;m<br/>\npresuming she is sleeping with you. I did that for my son when I just<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford to do sheets all the time and couldn&#39;t afford pull ups<br/>\nany long (especially in his size).  Instead of saying, &quot;You should be<br/>\nable to go all night without accidents&quot; you could say something like,<br/>\n&quot;Sometimes I can&#39;t make it all night without getting up to go potty.<br/>\nIf you feel you need to go potty during the night let me know so I can<br/>\nhelp you with lights.&quot;  Or whatever you think will work for your<br/>\nfamily.  My son is 8 and still gets up at least once a night to go to<br/>\nthe bathroom.  Started soon after I &quot;gave him permission.&quot;  Basically<br/>\nI gave him an idea and it seemed to work for him.  He didn&#39;t like<br/>\nwaking up wet anymore than I would have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea might be a side car that she can sleep on next to you<br/>\nlessening the chance of the big sheets from being wet as often.  Much<br/>\neasier to wash a toddler or twin size sheet than a queen or king.  And<br/>\nkeep the sheets in a basket at the end of the bed for quick changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205555026,"authorName":"Renee McGraw","from":"&quot;Renee McGraw&quot; &lt;mwaynejr@...&gt;","profile":"dazynay","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"2yo bed wetting...solutions for quick and peaceful clean up????","postDate":"1156192825","msgId":16617,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVQRURJQktLS0RDTkNQSElMSUpEQ0VGQ0dPQUEubXdheW5lanJAYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16618,"prevInTime":16616,"nextInTime":16618,"topicId":16617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My youngest child is just a few months past her 2nd birthday.
