You&#39;re simply <br/>\nthe parent of a three year old! It&#39;s exhausting! Around here, we say: <br/>\n&quot;Two&#39;s a myth, Three&#39;s reality!&quot;---meaning &quot;you think you were tired <br/>\nwith a TWO year old?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really make sure your iron is in good shape.

But again---so can a <br/>\nthree year old! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoe she nap? What do you do when he&#39;s napping? Please don&#39;t say &quot;the <br/>\nlaundry&quot;! You *should* be napping WITH him!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mother-in-law is there, right? Why can&#39;t she watch him while you <br/>\nnap? Is she trustworthy?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have a friend with whom you could trade days to watch each <br/>\nother&#39;s kids for a few hours while you each nap?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a teen you could pay to watch him while you nap?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course *he* doesn&#39;t understand that you need to nap. He&#39;s THREE! <br/>\nHe&#39;s always on the go! Energy to spare! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t stress enough that, even though you&#39;re feeling completely <br/>\nexhausted now, he gets older every single day---and this won&#39;t last <br/>\nforever! He really will be grown and gone before you know it. Find ways <br/>\nto snatch naps---even just having your feet in a kiddie pool while he <br/>\nsplashes or sitting nearby while he plays legos or ....whatever you can <br/>\ndo while sitting while he plays.
