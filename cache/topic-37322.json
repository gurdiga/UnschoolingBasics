And they&#39;ve morphed---the interests, not the boys! &lt;g&gt; Cameron&#39;s interest in skateboarding morphed into film-making, which back-tracked to his interest in magic, which morphed into drumming which didn&#39;t morph at all, but rather jumped headlong into back-packing and exploring nature and foreign countries and travel.

We&#39;re guessing he will b<br/>\ne moving out this next year. He&#39;s started talking about it. We figure he&#39;ll move to Charleston to be with the girlfriend. He&#39;s made some inquiries into working in a kitchen with a chef. He may find THAT is his love, and it may become his career. He may just learn a LOT, leave to pursue something else, and be an excellent home cook. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s all good. I mean---who doesn&#39;t like a good cook in the house?? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe certainly has what it takes---talent and tenacity---to be a top magician, but we think he&#39;ll just perform small sleights for little kids. &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s has a wonderful eye behind a camera---or so we&#39;re told.

We open doors for them. We point things out they may not  <br/>\nsee that we think they&#39;d like. We lead bits of the greater world into  <br/>\ntheir world that we think might interest them. We support them in  <br/>\ntheir exploration. We create an environment that nurtures their need  <br/>\nto explore.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;achieve in life&quot; is another phrase that will get in the way of  <br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s focusing too far into the future. Life! That&#39;s the  <br/>\nnext 80 or so years! It&#39;s impossible to give anyone a standard  <br/>\nfoundation of knowledge to prepare for it. There will be jobs in the  <br/>\nfuture that don&#39;t even exist now. If a parent does want to help their  <br/>\nkids achieve what the kids want in life, the parent can live the  <br/>\nphilosophy &quot;You can achieve anything you set your mind to do.&quot;  <br/>\nBecause that&#39;s really the only preparation that works for whatever  <br/>\ntwists and turns life will throw at them over the next 8 decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really look at the phrase &quot;lead them to what they want to achieve  <br/>\nin life.&quot; Life goals change throughout our lives. Very few people  <br/>\nhave the same goals at the end of their lives as they had as teens.  <br/>\nBut even if you meant helping them work towards a career that  <br/>\ninterests them, most people, especially today, don&#39;t have just one  <br/>\ncareer. It used to be people went into, say, banking out of school  <br/>\nand died as bankers. My father started work as an engineer at one  <br/>\ncompany and retired as a senior engineer with the same company.  <br/>\nStability was important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s a lot more freeing, helps people reach for happiness a  <br/>\nlot easier, to see initial careers as just that: initial careers.  <br/>\nThey may explore many diverse jobs throughout their lives. (Or might  <br/>\nnot!) We can&#39;t prepare them for that. But what we *can* do is help  <br/>\nthem explore the interests they have right now because that&#39;s the  <br/>\nmost likely foundation that their future explorations will spring from.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust ask Kelly Lovejoy! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband began as a supervisor and worked upward. Then quit and  <br/>\nwent back to college to coach and manage athletics. He&#39;s done some of  <br/>\nthat, but took a side track into running two sports programs through  <br/>\nthe college and teaching math as an adjunct. He would still like to  <br/>\ndo athletic management of some sort and has his eye out for those  <br/>\ntypes of jobs. The jobs he&#39;s had (and wants) have a foundation in his  <br/>\ninterests. No parent could have prepared him to do all that, or &quot;lead  <br/>\nhim to achieve his life goals&quot;. No parent could have foreseen where  <br/>\nhe&#39;d end up. *He* couldn&#39;t have foreseen that. But his parents *did*  <br/>\nsupport his love of sports in school. He did have the ability to take  <br/>\nmath classes (but, as I&#39;ve said, I think there are much better ways  <br/>\nto learn math.*)<br/>\n<br/>\n(* Interestingly, when he teaches a new math course, he goes through  <br/>\nthe book and understands it well enough to get the kids through the  <br/>\nclass, but it isn&#39;t until he&#39;s taught it three or four times that he  <br/>\nreally gets the concepts. But *again* he&#39;s learning textbook math.  <br/>\nWhen there&#39;s a homework problem he&#39;s having a tough time figuring out  <br/>\nif his answer&#39;s wrong or the book is wrong he asks me because I can  <br/>\noften see the problem in a totally different way. My vision isn&#39;t  <br/>\nblocked by the formula the book is trying to teach.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I have a degree in electrical engineering, by the way. Textbook math  <br/>\nwas easy for me but I didn&#39;t really understand how it all worked. I  <br/>\ncould identify what type of problem it was and apply the solution we  <br/>\nwere &quot;supposed&quot; to. It wasn&#39;t until years later, just by living life  <br/>\nsince I only worked as a software engineer for four years, that I was  <br/>\nable to get a holistic picture of what the math was trying to  <br/>\ndescribe. It wasn&#39;t until I could see my daughter playing around with  <br/>\nnumbers and making them give the answer she needed, that I understood  <br/>\nhow math described the world rather than being a separate entity.  <br/>\nObserving the world and thinking about it in new ways is better  <br/>\npreparation for higher math than going through lower math textbooks.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rather I want to help them find the happiness I have found.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, this will seem like semantics, but the above is ambiguous.<br/>\n<br/>\nClearer is: helping kids achieve their own happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard parents say that they got so much pleasure from reading  <br/>\nthat they want that gift for their kids too and are worried that  <br/>\ntheir kids aren&#39;t reading so are missing out. What will help those  <br/>\nparents is to see how their kids are already happy and help them get  <br/>\nmore of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some parents, financial security is important and they want to  <br/>\nhelp their kids find ways to get that form of happiness. The  <br/>\ntemptation will be to help them tone down risky dreams and see life  <br/>\nmore practically. Eg, get a stable job and be a writer on your off  <br/>\nhours. But what will help is supporting kids in their dreams. *Part*  <br/>\nof exploring those dreams will be the reality of how others achieved  <br/>\ntheir goals. (Often by working a mundane job and working on their  <br/>\ndream at night! ;-) Factory jobs are excellent for this since the  <br/>\nbrain is free to work on other things while the body earns the money ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you mean one of those two or not is not as important as how  <br/>\nreaders interpret your words and what images they create for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Therefore, I see everything I do or don&#39;t do as a decision to  <br/>\n&gt; assist them in finding that fulfillment<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And what if fulfillment at the moment is playing World of Warcraft?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the mindset that will help unschooling. The more we focus on  <br/>\nactivities that look like practical life goals, the easier it is to  <br/>\nget in our kids way and easier to miss what they&#39;re learning the most  <br/>\nfrom. It&#39;s too easy to see them learning when it looks like school.  <br/>\nWhat helps unschoolers is cultivating an ability to see that they&#39;re  <br/>\nlearning when they&#39;re engaged, regardless of how it doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of that may apply to you. Responses (as well as the questions!)  <br/>\nare for everyone reading, who may be forming different images than  <br/>\nare in your life, different than what you intended to create.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and I worry as a parent if what I am doing is justified by  <br/>\n&gt; that...not whether or not I am fulfilling a defined public code of  <br/>\n&gt; whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Worry&quot; may be semantics again but it does call up particular images  <br/>\nfor most people. (And, of course, some people are relieved, saying  <br/>\n&quot;Good, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one worried!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWorry is a good indicator that something&#39;s off. But if worry becomes  <br/>\na constant response to life that&#39;s not useful. It&#39;s spinning the  <br/>\nwheels. usually because someone feels they have no control over the  <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling some lack of control is a given! We can&#39;t control  <br/>\nwhich doors our kids will choose to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool gives us the *illlusion* that we can control the out come. And  <br/>\nallows us to blame the child for not trying hard enough when that  <br/>\noutcome doesn&#39;t come to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorries are normal. For some worries we need to find techniques to  <br/>\nhelp us worry less and trust more. For some the list is a good resource.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Obviously many kids go onto college and become self<br/>\n&gt;&gt; supporting. So we assume school is responsible<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I got a good snicker out of this one. I am self educated...I never  <br/>\n&gt; went to college. In fact, I didn&#39;t graduate High School. I took my  <br/>\n&gt; GED later-breezed through it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>GEDs being a breeze is useful for people to know :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut school being unnecessary is also not the mindset of many. Most  <br/>\npeople *do* see school as responsible for getting kids into college  <br/>\nand into stable careers. When ideas are phrased in a way that paints  <br/>\nthat picture, it doesn&#39;t matter that the writer has a different  <br/>\nexperience. No one can know what has gone on in the writer&#39;s life.  <br/>\nThey can only form pictures from the words they&#39;re given.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have found ways to cope with it, and have my own strange work- <br/>\n&gt; arounds that always come out right, but it boggles my husband&#39;s mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, yes, because he was trained to see particular solutions to  <br/>\nparticular problems. People are taught efficient ways to tackle  <br/>\nstandard problems rather than how to look at problems. (Because  <br/>\nteaching how to tackle problems is *hard* and difficult to test.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in real life, there isn&#39;t just one way to look at a problem.  <br/>\nWhatever ways work and makes things understandable is useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suppose this is just something that is individual to the child  <br/>\n&gt; and will need to be addressed when the need arises and not prior to  <br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes. They could change their minds and the preparation will have been  <br/>\ntime that could have been spent on more meaningful things.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could get turned off of math or things to do with math because  <br/>\nsomeone is preparing them rather than them choosing to do the  <br/>\npreparation themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, my husband, the engineer, uses math constantly and these  <br/>\n&gt; areas are ones my children are beginning to explore and find deep  <br/>\n&gt; interest in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Interest is good. My husband teaches college math and my daughter  <br/>\ndecided to take his college statistics class for fun when she was 14.  <br/>\nShe did very well. (Obviously she had him there available to answer  <br/>\nquestions but she did the tests all on her own.) She took several  <br/>\nmore math classes for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince she is more art oriented, she doesn&#39;t need the math, but the  <br/>\none college she was interested in had a basic math course the first  <br/>\nsemester. She could skip it if she took calculus in high school.  <br/>\n(Obviously just a way of setting the bar so high that most kids had  <br/>\nto take the math course! ;-) When he started pressuring her to take  <br/>\npre-calculus and calculus as a way to give her the opportunity to  <br/>\ntake something else, she started losing interest in math. It became  <br/>\nabout jumping through hoops rather than about exploring something  <br/>\nthat fascinated her.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":20623128,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;wee_wah@...&gt;","profile":"bluishbear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: question about core subjects","postDate":"1229400346","msgId":37342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdpNzllcSs4c28wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY5OTMwQjdBLUYzQzctNDkyNi1BQkExLUIzRjdBNDhCNzY4NEBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37339,"nextInTopic":37344,"prevInTime":37341,"nextInTime":37343,"topicId":37322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam, Could you please elaborate on the following paragraph?

What we do is help our <br/>\nkids persue their interests. We do have to do a certain amount of <br/>\nreporting, although in our case its more to my stepson&#39;s bio mom than <br/>\nto the state, and in the process of compiling that information I show <br/>\nhow Ray (15) is learning some of the same sorts of things he would in <br/>\nschool. I say some, bc frankly I think he&#39;s learning vastly more than <br/>\nhe would be learning in school, but bc its not the exact same <br/>\ninformation in the same order, its sometimes hard to compare. <br/>\n<br/>\nMath&#39;s a good example. The kind of math he&#39;s learning noodling around <br/>\nin our woodshop, futzing around with jewelry making with friends, <br/>\njamming on drums and bass with his dad and other musicians, working <br/>\nodd jobs, comparative shopping for the best deals on electronics and <br/>\njuggling gear - that&#39;s real world math. Its Not school math. Its <br/>\nexactly the math he needs right now to persue his life goals. And by <br/>\nlearning it the way many adults learn the same things (hey, how do <br/>\nyou figure thas out? what&#39;s this tool for? how much did you pay for <br/>\nthat?), he&#39;s gaining confidence in his ability to learn whatever else <br/>\nhe&#39;ll need to know later on in life. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling differs from &quot;educating our children&quot; in that it has to <br/>\ndo with supporting the Processes by which learning takes place, <br/>\nrather than managing learning, itself. Those processes are complex <br/>\nand subtle and have a big emotional component, so a big focus of <br/>\nradical unschooling, especially, is on the relationships within a <br/>\nfamily. That can seem baffling at first!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that helped me wrap my mind around some of the core <br/>\nconcepts of unschooling, early on, was to think about the kinds of <br/>\nlife skills that people benefit from having regardless of what they <br/>\nmay be doing in life. That&#39;s a useful question to ask yourself - what <br/>\nkinds of skills and attributes are helpful to Anyone, regardless of <br/>\nhis or her life path? After all, we don&#39;t really know what our kids <br/>\nwill be doing in 20yrs. So &quot;preparing&quot; them ultimately has less to do <br/>\nwith specific subject matter like fractions or the periodic table, <br/>\nand more to do with things like &quot;enthusiasm for learning&quot; and &quot;self-<br/>\nawareness&quot; and &quot;communication skills&quot;. Those are the &quot;core subjects&quot; <br/>\nif you will, of unschooling. And since it isn&#39;t really possible to <br/>\nteach someone to be enthusiastic or aware or communicative, the <br/>\nmethods of unschooling can seem strange and puzzling for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith that in mind, something else I found useful in the beginning of <br/>\nmy own unschooling journey was simply reading the stories of <br/>\nunschoolers lives. Even a random story about a kid ordering a new <br/>\nfood in a restaurant for the first time can be rich in the details of <br/>\nwhat all this subtle, complex stuff looks like in real life. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a link to some &quot;typical unschooling days&quot; stories to get you <br/>\nstarted:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/typical\">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] question about core subjects","postDate":"1229385998","msgId":37335,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY5OTMwQjdBLUYzQzctNDkyNi1BQkExLUIzRjdBNDhCNzY4NEBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDRDk0RUE2ODFDNjRDMzM4RTg0RDVCRkIwQjg0OEQ3QGhhbGxkZXNrdG9wPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdpNGQwbytjN2NtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTBDMTZBRjEtNDZCRC00OTIzLUE5MzQtMDUzRDRGODY5MkM0QHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8QUNEOTRFQTY4MUM2NEMzMzhFODRENUJGQjBCODQ4RDdAaGFsbGRlc2t0b3A+"},"prevInTopic":37333,"nextInTopic":37336,"prevInTime":37334,"nextInTime":37336,"topicId":37322,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As my child&#39;s teacher, leader, parent or whatever role I am in at the time and whatever hat I wear, it is my responsibility to lead them to what they want to achieve in life. It is the reason I hung up my &quot;me lifestyle&quot; and placed it on hold. I don&#39;t want to live my own life through my children, rather I want to help them find the happiness I have found. Therefore, I see everything I do or don&#39;t do as a decision to assist them in finding that fulfillment and I worry as a parent if what I am doing is justified by that...not whether or not I am fulfilling a defined public code of whatever. I often analyze myself and actions with a very critical eye to see if I am doing what I need to be doing for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is the &quot;gift&quot; parents give of education. It&#39;s a gift that takes <br/>\nover their children&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s something that brings them to <br/>\ntears and grief often<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the reason I pulled my children out of public school and brought them home to teach. It is also the reason I have switched my teaching methods and style to what it currently is now. While there were no tears with home teaching with textbooks, I didn&#39;t see that little light in their eyes of eagerness to learn and explore. I always felt that exploring our world and finding our own interests and niche what what education should be all about. I guess that is why I never found mine in school as my heartfelt desire was to be a parent first and have a career later. I now have both and couldn&#39;t be happier. My life took unexpected turns and I ended up being a factory worker...all that education for naught in the eyes of some...and I absolutely love it. I don&#39;t want my children to necessarily avoid those pitfalls because if it weren&#39;t for some of them, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am now and what a pity that would be! <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously many kids go onto college and become self <br/>\nsupporting. So we assume school is responsible<br/>\n<br/>\nI got a good snicker out of this one. I am self educated...I never went to college. In fact, I didn&#39;t graduate High School. I took my GED later-breezed through it. I never had a problem with learning, just a problem with the institution and mind set as a whole. It makes me wonder what ever possessed me to put my children into a cess pot I fought so hard to escape from. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math as a side effect of using math looks nothing like <br/>\nschool math. It takes minutes a week as opposed to hours. Until you <br/>\nsee kids absorbing the concepts from using them in context it&#39;s <br/>\npretty much impossible to have confidence that that&#39;s enough for them <br/>\nto build a foundation from<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my situation, math does not come easy. I have found ways to cope with it, and have my own strange work-arounds that always come out right, but it boggles my husband&#39;s mind. In my own field of work, nothing more than simple mathematics and the ability to balance the checkbook, along with my trusty calculator are all that are needed. It works for me. However, my husband, the engineer, uses math constantly and these areas are ones my children are beginning to explore and find deep interest in. Should they decide to pursue a field such as this, they are going to need to be able to use these forms of math. Hence the reason for my question. Should the need arise, and should they desire it, what route would be best to take to fit their needs...I suppose this is just something that is individual to the child and will need to be addressed when the need arises and not prior to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just <br/>\nsemantics&quot; but the way you&#39;ve phrased this shows you&#39;re thinking <br/>\nabout learning in schoolish ways so unschooling will make less sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually in this case it really was a case of semantics. I have been a lurker on this list for a while now and I&#39;ve seen this issue pop up already. Being sensitive to that and hoping to steer away from it, I have just made it worse apparently. I used the quotes to indicate that I was using PS verbage not my own feelings and without knowing the jargon...I was unsure how to express myself without reverting to it. You have answered some of my questions, and intensified others with your responses. I will do some &#39;net surfing to find what I need. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your lengthly reply.

So if you&#39;re expecting unschooling to provide what  <br/>\n&gt; schools do, you&#39;ll be frustrated when you don&#39;t see it happening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The original goal of public school in the US was to raise the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>minimum  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; level of education of the masses cheaply.

It&#39;s important because we still use that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>same  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; model but call on it to do something it was never designed to do: <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; prepare kids to go onto college. (Obviously school fails at that, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ever since the 50&#39;s and the Russians beat us into space with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sputnik,  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; schools have been pressured (and seen) as a place to prepare kids <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; move into technical education and jobs.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is that people don&#39;t naturally learn the way schools  <br/>\n&gt; present information.

In the process of exploring they learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven that&#39;s not totally clear since &quot;explore the world&quot; and &quot;learn&quot; <br/>\nmean something different in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo an unschooler &quot;explore the world&quot; has two parts: One part is what <br/>\nthe child is immediately interested in. The other part is what the <br/>\nparents keep moving through their kids lives so the kids have easy <br/>\naccess to new interests when they need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Giving an education&quot; is a phrase that is useful to examine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSociety talks about giving the gift of education. But examine that <br/>\nconcept of gift and giving. The expectation of a Birthday gift is <br/>\nthat it&#39;s something (we hope) the receiver wants. It&#39;s also something <br/>\nthat *should* come with no strings attached. Giving someone a Model T <br/>\ncar that requires hours of maintenance and many dollars worth of work <br/>\nto someone who wanted a new Honda that needed dropped off for <br/>\nmaintenance once a year isn&#39;t much of a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is the &quot;gift&quot; parents give of education. It&#39;s a gift that takes <br/>\nover their children&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s something that brings them to <br/>\ntears and grief often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe expectation is that it prepares them to be anything they want. <br/>\nAnything that torturous better be good we come to believe. (As kids <br/>\nwe have to believe it&#39;s all worth it or we&#39;ll go crazy. And some kids <br/>\nwho can&#39;t accept it, do go crazy in the form of rebellion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is it? Obviously many kids go onto college and become self <br/>\nsupporting. So we assume school is responsible. But many kids don&#39;t. <br/>\nSome kids take a different route to fulfillment. Some kids don&#39;t <br/>\nbecome successes at all. So there must be something else that&#39;s <br/>\ncreating self-supporting, fulfilled people but we can&#39;t see it <br/>\nbecause essentially everyone goes to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why scientists have control groups. A group where you do <br/>\neverything except what you&#39;re testing for. Unschooled kids are the <br/>\ncontrol group. They aren&#39;t doing anything that resembles school and <br/>\nyet they prepare themselves to be what they want to be by *being* <br/>\nwhat they want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have insisted that my children continue<br/>\n&gt; to use our workbooks for their math, but have allowed them to explore<br/>\n&gt; their own interests in all other areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading and math are probably the hardest for new-to-unschooling <br/>\nparents to let go of. That&#39;s because the methods schools use are so <br/>\ninefficient and difficult to learn from that we&#39;ve come to believe <br/>\nthat the subjects themselves are difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math as a side effect of using math looks nothing like <br/>\nschool math. It takes minutes a week as opposed to hours. Until you <br/>\nsee kids absorbing the concepts from using them in context it&#39;s <br/>\npretty much impossible to have confidence that that&#39;s enough for them <br/>\nto build a foundation from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way schools teach math is like teaching kids formal grammar and <br/>\nvocabulary and sentence structure of a language they have no <br/>\nimmediate use for and expecting kids to learn the language that way. <br/>\nUnless kids have a natural bent for that type of math (structured <br/>\nmath is like fun math puzzles for many kids, as it was for me), the <br/>\noutcome is kids who either feel they&#39;re stupid for not getting it or <br/>\nthat math is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that school math provides lots of formula practice for <br/>\nkids with a bent for formulas. The other kids are left scratching <br/>\ntheir heads. *Some* kids -- and not even all the ones who get good <br/>\ngrades in math -- do figure out *as a side effect* of school math, <br/>\nhow numbers work. Lots of kids don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe effect of school type math when it works for a child is getting <br/>\nkids to do school type math. That really has little to do with <br/>\nunderstanding what&#39;s actually going on with numbers. Kids can easily <br/>\nlearn how to write out the answers to percentage problems without <br/>\nunderstanding what a percentage is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool math is all taught backwards. Formal notation before <br/>\nunderstanding the concepts. That&#39;s because it&#39;s easy to test an <br/>\nunderstanding of formal notation and really hard to teach and test <br/>\nthe understanding of concepts. And schools must show that kids are <br/>\n&quot;improving&quot; so they need methods that can be tested. It&#39;s not what <br/>\neducators want, but it&#39;s what they&#39;re stuck with.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal math is learned by using the concepts. Then later, formal <br/>\nnotation can be learned fairly quickly. It&#39;s just a way of writing <br/>\nwhat someone already understands (rather than trying to make them <br/>\nwrite and work through what they don&#39;t understand with the hope that <br/>\nthey&#39;ll understand.)<br/>\n<br/>\nReal math learning looks like video games and art programs and <br/>\ncooking and programming DVRs and figuring out how many days until <br/>\nChristmas. It looks very much how kids learned to speak English: by <br/>\nusing it as a tool to get what they want, by playing with it, by <br/>\ntrying this out to see how they work. It takes minutes a week. (Or at <br/>\nleast minutes that we might consciously note as math. There&#39;s way <br/>\nmore going on that we wouldn&#39;t notice.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s more at:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://joyfullyrejo ycing.com/<br/>\ndown the left hand side.<br/>\n<br/>\nand at:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd. com/math/<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So my question is this: Under an unschooling philosophy, do you<br/>\n&gt; require your children to continue their education using &quot;standard&quot;<br/>\n&gt; measures in some subjects?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of those cases where some might think it&#39;s &quot;just <br/>\nsemantics&quot; but the way you&#39;ve phrased this shows you&#39;re thinking <br/>\nabout learning in schoolish ways so unschooling will make less sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;require&quot;: No to requiring academics. We might in a way require our <br/>\nkids to be polite, but require even in that context looks different <br/>\nthan the conventional parenting definition of require.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;continue their education&quot;: A better view of unschooling is opening <br/>\nthe doors to the world and accompanying them as they explore. <br/>\nOccasionally we might point something out that we think they might <br/>\nlike. We answer their questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;using &quot;standard&quot; measures&quot;: Once you&#39;ve stepped back away from <br/>\nschool, the less meaning standard measures has. School is like <br/>\nleading kids on a predetermined path through the zoo. They will read <br/>\nand observe what someone else has decided is important. They will go <br/>\nin the prescribed order because they must all stay together with <br/>\ntheir class. Unschooling is exploring the zoo on their own schedule, <br/>\ngoing where they want to go, going to places the parents says &quot;Hey, I <br/>\nthink you&#39;ll like this!&quot; (and moving on when it doesn&#39;t grab them), <br/>\ndoubling back to see the &quot;good parts&quot;. While all 3rd grades may do <br/>\nlions, and any 3rd grader who can&#39;t answer the standard questions <br/>\nabout lions then is a failure, that measure is meaningless to <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrder is only meaningful when something doesn&#39;t work. School type <br/>\nthinking will say kids can&#39;t learn multiplication before addition. In <br/>\nsome ways that true, but the way it&#39;s phrased is what blocks thinking <br/>\nabout how people really learn. In real life we don&#39;t learn addition <br/>\nand multiplication in isolation. We&#39;ll be exposed to both as well as <br/>\nlots of other concepts. We&#39;ll absorb and play around with what&#39;s <br/>\nmeaningful and useful, and learn more and more about how they work. <br/>\nSo for unschoolers addition won&#39;t be isolated from multiplication or <br/>\npercentages or decimals. It&#39;s all there to play with and pull meaning <br/>\nfrom as they use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot;: In unschooling the world isn&#39;t broken into subjects. <br/>\nEverything is interconnected. This is one of the harder concepts to <br/>\nlet go of! The works of English Literature is clearly separate from <br/>\nastronomy. I think the problem comes from believing there is some <br/>\nvalue in acquiring a body of knowledge that can be labeled &quot;English <br/>\nLiterature&quot; or &quot;astronomy&quot;. But what&#39;s valuable is being exposed in a <br/>\ndelightful way and then being free to explore, to drop, to come back <br/>\nwhen it strikes someone again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who will absorb what&#39;s valuable about English Literature can&#39;t <br/>\nbe stopped in an unschooling life. They&#39;ll suck it in because it <br/>\ninterests them. And they&#39;ll learn *way* more than someone who is <br/>\nrequired to study it without the danger of being turned off to a <br/>\nwhole lot of writing because someone made someone read and analyze a <br/>\nbook they hated. (I still have bad feelings about Silas Marner and <br/>\nanything that feels connected to it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty, though, is that no one can escape English Literature in <br/>\nan unschooling life. English Literature and the authors and the <br/>\npolitics of the world and &quot;timeless themes&quot; and the world that <br/>\nbrought it about are referenced in video games and movies and jokes <br/>\nand cartoons. There is probably no one thing that has done more <br/>\ndamage to Shakespeare than requiring kids to slog through reading and <br/>\nanalyzing it. But real life can create a curiosity and good feelings <br/>\nabout Shakespeare. There are modern versions of his plays as movies. <br/>\nHe pops up in cartoons. He and his characters are the subjects of <br/>\njokes. The end result of a life that has good encounters with <br/>\nShakespeare is creating a foundation for a child to explore him at <br/>\nvarious points through out their lives in a free and unpressured way. <br/>\n(And a child who will love him and go on to be a Shakespeare scholar, <br/>\nwon&#39;t be stopped by lack of required study ;-) They&#39;ll create their <br/>\nown way of pulling him in.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Take math for example. We are using a text<br/>\n&gt; book method, but I would be interested in pursuing a less traditional<br/>\n&gt; approach if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life<br/>\n&gt; goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;if it gave my children the tools they needed for their life goals.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does -- and yet the above phrase needs examined because it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething schools claim that they do but they&#39;re really providing <br/>\nsomething else. So if you&#39;re expecting unschooling to provide what <br/>\nschools do, you&#39;ll be frustrated when you don&#39;t see it happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original goal of public school in the US was to raise the minimum <br/>\nlevel of education of the masses cheaply. The US had a huge influx of <br/>\nimmigrants who were basically unemployable so the goal was to get as <br/>\nmany as possible up to speed on math and reading. They structured <br/>\nschools like an assembly line. This was back when assembly lines were <br/>\nan astounding boon to manufacturing: cheap, efficient. They turned <br/>\nout more and better quality products for way less money. When the <br/>\ngoal was simply to raise the minimum level of education, they seemed <br/>\nlike a boon to society.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is that important? It&#39;s important because we still use that same <br/>\nmodel but call on it to do something it was never designed to do: to <br/>\nprepare kids to go onto college. (Obviously school fails at that, but <br/>\never since the 50&#39;s and the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik, <br/>\nschools have been pressured (and seen) as a place to prepare kids to <br/>\nmove into technical education and jobs.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that people don&#39;t naturally learn the way schools <br/>\npresent information. Schools worked okay when the goals were simple: <br/>\nmath and reading and a bit about the world. But now that we want to <br/>\nget a massive amount of information into kids to *supposedly* prepare <br/>\nthem for anything they want to be, the flaws are glaring.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans naturally learn by doing. We learn by using tools to do what <br/>\ninterests us. We get better at what interests us because we&#39;re <br/>\nmotivated to do that thing. In the process, we use tools and, as a <br/>\nside effect, we get better at using the tools. And as a side effect <br/>\nwe learn things that connect with what interests us.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is like looking back on our lives and just doing all the <br/>\nthings that lead us to where we enjoy being and cutting out all the <br/>\ndull stuff that we never used. That scares people because we imagine <br/>\nwe would shut ourselves off from the subjects we hated like math or <br/>\nhistory. So how could kids prepare themselves if they shut those out. <br/>\nBut unschoolers can&#39;t shut themselves out. All those are part of our <br/>\nworld.

In the process of exploring they learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven that&#39;s not totally clear since &quot;explore the world&quot; and &quot;learn&quot;  <br/>\nmean something different in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo an unschooler &quot;explore the world&quot; has two parts: One part is what  <br/>\nthe child is immediately interested in. The other part is what the  <br/>\nparents keep moving through their kids lives so the kids have easy  <br/>\naccess to new interests when they need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Giving an education&quot; is a phrase that is useful to examine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSociety talks about giving the gift of education. But examine that  <br/>\nconcept of gift and giving. The expectation of a Birthday gift is  <br/>\nthat it&#39;s something (we hope) the receiver wants. It&#39;s also something  <br/>\nthat *should* come with no strings attached. Giving someone a Model T  <br/>\ncar that requires hours of maintenance and many dollars worth of work  <br/>\nto someone who wanted a new Honda that needed dropped off for  <br/>\nmaintenance once a year isn&#39;t much of a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is the &quot;gift&quot; parents give of education. It&#39;s a gift that takes  <br/>\nover their children&#39;s childhood. It&#39;s something that brings them to  <br/>\ntears and grief often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe expectation is that it prepares them to be anything they want.  <br/>\nAnything that torturous better be good we come to believe. (As kids  <br/>\nwe have to believe it&#39;s all worth it or we&#39;ll go crazy. And some kids  <br/>\nwho can&#39;t accept it, do go crazy in the form of rebellion.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is it? Obviously many kids go onto college and become self  <br/>\nsupporting. So we assume school is responsible. But many kids don&#39;t.  <br/>\nSome kids take a different route to fulfillment. Some kids don&#39;t  <br/>\nbecome successes at all. So there must be something else that&#39;s  <br/>\ncreating self-supporting, fulfilled people but we can&#39;t see it  <br/>\nbecause essentially everyone goes to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why scientists have control groups. A group where you do  <br/>\neverything except what you&#39;re testing for. Unschooled kids are the  <br/>\ncontrol group. They aren&#39;t doing anything that resembles school and  <br/>\nyet they prepare themselves to be what they want to be by *being*  <br/>\nwhat they want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have insisted that my children continue<br/>\n&gt; to use our workbooks for their math, but have allowed them to explore<br/>\n&gt; their own interests in all other areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Reading and math are probably the hardest for new-to-unschooling  <br/>\nparents to let go of. That&#39;s because the methods schools use are so  <br/>\ninefficient and difficult to learn from that we&#39;ve come to believe  <br/>\nthat the subjects themselves are difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math as a side effect of using math looks nothing like  <br/>\nschool math. It takes minutes a week as opposed to hours. Until you  <br/>\nsee kids absorbing the concepts from using them in context it&#39;s  <br/>\npretty much impossible to have confidence that that&#39;s enough for them  <br/>\nto build a foundation from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way schools teach math is like teaching kids formal grammar and  <br/>\nvocabulary and sentence structure of a language they have no  <br/>\nimmediate use for and expecting kids to learn the language that way.  <br/>\nUnless kids have a natural bent for that type of math (structured  <br/>\nmath is like fun math puzzles for many kids, as it was for me), the  <br/>\noutcome is kids who either feel they&#39;re stupid for not getting it or  <br/>\nthat math is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that school math provides lots of formula practice for  <br/>\nkids with a bent for formulas. The other kids are left scratching  <br/>\ntheir heads. *Some* kids -- and not even all the ones who get good  <br/>\ngrades in math -- do figure out *as a side effect* of school math,  <br/>\nhow numbers work. Lots of kids don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe effect of school type math when it works for a child is getting  <br/>\nkids to do school type math. That really has little to do with  <br/>\nunderstanding what&#39;s actually going on with numbers. Kids can easily  <br/>\nlearn how to write out the answers to percentage problems without  <br/>\nunderstanding what a percentage is.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool math is all taught backwards. Formal notation before  <br/>\nunderstanding the concepts. That&#39;s because it&#39;s easy to test an  <br/>\nunderstanding of formal notation and really hard to teach and test  <br/>\nthe understanding of concepts. And schools must show that kids are  <br/>\n&quot;improving&quot; so they need methods that can be tested. It&#39;s not what  <br/>\neducators want, but it&#39;s what they&#39;re stuck with.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal math is learned by using the concepts. Then later, formal  <br/>\nnotation can be learned fairly quickly. It&#39;s just a way of writing  <br/>\nwhat someone already understands (rather than trying to make them  <br/>\nwrite and work through what they don&#39;t understand with the hope that  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll understand.)<br/>\n<br/>\nReal math learning looks like video games and art programs and  <br/>\ncooking and programming DVRs and figuring out how many days until  <br/>\nChristmas. It looks very much how kids learned to speak English: by  <br/>\nusing it as a tool to get what they want, by playing with it, by  <br/>\ntrying this out to see how they work. It takes minutes a week. (Or at  <br/>\nleast minutes that we might consciously note as math.

We might in a way require our  <br/>\nkids to be polite, but require even in that context looks different  <br/>\nthan the conventional parenting definition of require.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;continue their education&quot;: A better view of unschooling is opening  <br/>\nthe doors to the world and accompanying them as they explore.  <br/>\nOccasionally we might point something out that we think they might  <br/>\nlike.
