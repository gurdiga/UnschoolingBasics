I can see the importance of<br/>\ndeschooling *for me* and that&#39;s something that has caught me by<br/>\nsurprise.  Not so much because I find myself thinking academics (the art<br/>\nmuseum was an interest last month but apparently has lost its appeal),<br/>\nbut because I realize that for the last couple years, my interests have<br/>\nrevolved around things that allowed me to take a break from my kids. <br/>\nThese were &#39;escapes&quot; for me and so by nature, do not really lend<br/>\nthemselves to socializing.  There&#39;s no reason to continue that, however,<br/>\nand I really don&#39;t feel any desire to take a break from my kids now,<br/>\neven though I&#39;m finding myself doing more with and for them than before.<br/>\nAll these ideas sound so natural and yet I&#39;m finding myself trying to<br/>\ncome up with ideas rather than exploring what&#39;s around me as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, we took a bike ride downtown and stopped and poked around a thrift<br/>\nstore.
