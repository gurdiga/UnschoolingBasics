Is the <br/>\nunschooling<br/>\nlife a life of zero rules? Or is it not forcing the issue on little<br/>\nthings like bed times or clothes or how much they eat?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have ARBITRARY rules, we live by principles.  We <br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;force&quot; our children to do anything.  We work together as a <br/>\nteam and because we respect our children and they know that we are <br/>\non their side they are more than willing (most of the time) to help <br/>\nout when things need to get done.  We try to help them to listen to <br/>\nthe signs their bodies are giving them for when they need sleep, <br/>\nfood, or whatever.  We feel that our jobs, as parents, are to bring <br/>\nas much joy in their lives as possible, spend as much time with them <br/>\nso that we don&#39;t miss out on anything, be there for them when they <br/>\nare having trouble making a difficult decision (ultimately they make <br/>\ntheir own decisions about everything unless I see that they are in <br/>\ndanger), and really help to guide them as they discover their unique <br/>\npurpose here on this earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also try to involve our children in all aspects of our lives, <br/>\nincluding paying the bills, home decorating, and many other things.  <br/>\nWe just made an offer on a house that my kids were not a part of the <br/>\ndecision making because they refused to go house hunting with us.  <br/>\nWhen my son saw the house he was very angry because he didn&#39;t like <br/>\nit.  It is a fixer upper and we plan on doing all the work before we <br/>\nmove in but he doesn&#39;t see our vision.  So I took him with me to <br/>\npick out appliances, counter tops, etc.  He picked some counter tops <br/>\nout that I didn&#39;t like but we were able to find another one that we <br/>\nboth liked so that is what we are going to get.  I think the point <br/>\nthat I am trying to make is that we treat our kids like people not <br/>\nlike the second class citizens that they are treated like by so much <br/>\nof the outside world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that I always think of when I am about to handle a <br/>\nsituation is ,&quot;How would I treat my best friend or my husband in a <br/>\nsituation like this?&quot;  That often helps me to be a little more <br/>\nrespectful, especially when I am angry and frustrated.  I also try <br/>\nto think of how I felt when I was a child when I didn&#39;t think I was <br/>\nbeing treated fairly and how I would have wanted my parents to <br/>\nhandle it better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi Snavley</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15816,"nextTopicId":15858}}
