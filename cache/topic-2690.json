What I had the hardest time with in my Camp Fire club was  <br/>\nhaving to include schooled kids.  I just had to deal with them differently  than <br/>\nI did unschooled kids.  I couldn&#39;t reach them unless I spoke in  language they <br/>\nunderstood (school speak).  <br/>\n <br/>\nCamp Fire doesn&#39;t require that you do anything the way it is written,  unless <br/>\nyou&#39;re going to compete in national things.  We were very free form  in our <br/>\nclub.  And I never considered the beads and emblems as &quot;earned&quot;,  really.  I <br/>\nstressed that they were momentos of an experience they had,  something to remind <br/>\nthem of a good time.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you could get a whole club full of unschoolers, I can imagine that would  <br/>\nbe one awesome club.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35875473,"authorName":"heather mclean","from":"heather mclean &lt;heather@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] youth organizations for unschoolers?","postDate":"1092197963","msgId":2693,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODExMDQxOTIzLjI1MjYxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNzEzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYuMzAyODkwM2MuMmU0YWUwMTVAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":2691,"nextInTopic":2695,"prevInTime":2692,"nextInTime":2694,"topicId":2690,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi.

The regional director is here in Tucson AND<br/>\nshe was a homeschooler.  BUT we had to agree to sell<br/>\ncandy bars and another fundraiser.  We weren&#39;t allowed<br/>\nto choose to do something different to get out of the<br/>\ncandy bar sales, OR to just donate the money<br/>\nourselves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I did some searching - I think I actually found out<br/>\nabout this on a homeschool/unschool list, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember which one - and we ended up starting a Roots<br/>\n& Shoots club.  This is a Jane Goodall organization<br/>\nfor kids.  Focus is one caring for the earth, caring<br/>\nfor people, and caring for animals.  They offer<br/>\n&quot;lesson plans&quot; for younger kids.  I guess a lot of<br/>\ntheir clubs are in schools.  But the California office<br/>\ninterviewed me & put a little blurb on their &quot;new,<br/>\nimproved&quot; website last year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is VERY flexible and NO badges/beads stuff which is<br/>\nexactly what I wanted PLUS we are linked to an<br/>\ninternational organization which is pretty cool (for<br/>\nme anyway LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to share some of the cool stuff we&#39;ve<br/>\ndone , if you are interested.
