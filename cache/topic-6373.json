Not that I really care, what are they going to do stand in the middle of the country and watch in my windows?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Carol<br/>\n<br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6314,"nextTopicId":6407}}
