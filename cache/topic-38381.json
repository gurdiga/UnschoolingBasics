I absolutelyÂ <br/>\n&gt; LOVE conferences; they are ways to connect with old friends, meet new ones, relax, <br/>\nandÂ <br/>\n&gt; celebrate all that is good and wonderful in our lives.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you ever been to a conference? Are you uncertain about going? Is your husband <br/>\norÂ <br/>\n&gt; partner resistant? I know what that&#39;s like, and it can be scary as hell - but so <br/>\nincrediblyÂ <br/>\n&gt; rewarding. Read on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Every time another conference approaches, it reminds me of how I felt in the monthsÂ <br/>\n&gt; leading up to my first one, Live and Learn in Albuquerque in 2006. When Ginger told <br/>\nmeÂ <br/>\n&gt; she wanted to go, I was pretty unsure - a conference? I mean REALLY? I&#39;ve been to a ton <br/>\nofÂ <br/>\n&gt; conferences in my professional life, and they are so - - well - - boring and formal. I<br/>\n&gt; mean, Conferences are places where we all wear name badges, and sit around at <br/>\ntablesÂ <br/>\n&gt; forcing<br/>\n&gt;  conversation with people we don&#39;t know. Conferences are where we pick up 37Â <br/>\n&gt; pounds of printed flyers and brochures that we&#39;ll never read again. They&#39;re places <br/>\nwhereÂ <br/>\n&gt; we fight to stay awake all day so we can earn the right to go back to our rooms and <br/>\nwatchÂ <br/>\n&gt; TV. I mean, unschooling sounded okay - - I was even kinda enjoying it. Why the hell did <br/>\nIÂ <br/>\n&gt; need to fly across the country to bore myself?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As the conference got closer, my concerns took a new turn. No longer was I worried <br/>\naboutÂ <br/>\n&gt; being bored; I was worried about being overwhelmed and unaccepted. What if <br/>\neveryoneÂ <br/>\n&gt; there already knew each other? What if I wasn&#39;t cool enough, or funny enough, or <br/>\nsmartÂ <br/>\n&gt; enough, or - - God forbid - - unschooly enough? I had serious visions that someoneÂ <br/>\n&gt; would approach Ginger a few days into the conference, point at me, and say &quot;He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;tÂ <br/>\n&gt; belong here - - I think you should reconsider this unschooling thing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we were flying there, I began to feel better, but still had one nagging concern; all <br/>\nofÂ <br/>\n&gt; these Dads were probably so cool, and they probably had neat non-traditional careers <br/>\nthatÂ <br/>\n&gt; allowed them to stay home and be with their kids all of the time, and how could I <br/>\npossiblyÂ <br/>\n&gt; compete with that? Did I even deserve to be here? What the hell would I do when I got <br/>\ntoÂ <br/>\n&gt; the hotel and the whole thing started?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And then we got there, and the rest of my life began. The entire weekend was a dream: <br/>\nIÂ <br/>\n&gt; learned, I laughed, I cried, I=2<br/>\n&gt; 0relaxed, I played, I created, I asked, I answered, I dug deep, IÂ <br/>\n&gt; slept, I stayed up all night, I followed my kids around everywhere they wanted me to <br/>\nandÂ <br/>\n&gt; left them alone when they wanted that, I was challenged, I challenged, I made <br/>\namazingÂ <br/>\n&gt; friends from 6 months old to 70, and I came to one essential understanding of my life:Â <br/>\n&gt; happiness is king and rules all. My happiness, Ginger&#39;s Kai&#39;s, Kade&#39;s, and everyone elseÂ <br/>\n&gt; that we had a chance to interact with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So here&#39;s what I did at my first conference, and why I think you should go:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went to main presentations: the ones from Ren Allen and Ben Lovejoy stood out,Â <br/>\n&gt; primarily because they made me think about the love I have for my children and howÂ <br/>\n&gt; much it can still deepen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went to circle chats and smaller meetings. My first circle chat was with Barbara <br/>\nChase,Â <br/>\n&gt; and while way too many brain cells have left the building to remember the exact topic, I <br/>\ndoÂ <br/>\n&gt; recall feeling energized and excited by one critical thing: not everyone there was anÂ <br/>\n&gt; &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;radical&quot;, and they were all learning and growing, just like me - even the <br/>\nfolksÂ <br/>\n&gt; who have been doing it for years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I went to SSUDS meetings. The Secret Society of Unschooling Dads is really just a coolÂ <br/>\n&gt; acronym; there&#39;s nothing secret about it. My first SSUDS meeting was just dads andÂ <br/>\n&gt; grandads and such, with lots of no-holds barred Q&A about being a Dad and <br/>\nunschooling.Â <br/>\n&gt; I asked tons of questions, and was challenged all alo<br/>\n&gt; ng the way. It was rough for me,Â <br/>\n&gt; because many of the answers I got were strange and new - but the people who <br/>\nansweredÂ <br/>\n&gt; me did it from the heart, with no other goal than to make me a better unschooling <br/>\ndad.Â <br/>\n&gt; And then after the meeting and all through the weekend, they each sought me out to <br/>\ntalkÂ <br/>\n&gt; one-on-one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I ran a fun shop. What a great way to meet people! Fun shops are just that; fun, fun, <br/>\nfun.Â <br/>\n&gt; We decided to make tissue paper kites ,and brought tissue paper, string, decorations,Â <br/>\n&gt; markers, glue sticks, etc. Kids and their parents just flowed in for the whole hour, and <br/>\nweÂ <br/>\n&gt; found ourselves scrambling just to catch up and keep them all supplied! But we met <br/>\nsoÂ <br/>\n&gt; many cool people and cool kids, and that helped us make connections that led to <br/>\ndeeperÂ <br/>\n&gt; conversations over that weekend - and over the years since.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I participated in the raffle and instant gratification table. I got a chance to buy raffle <br/>\nticketsÂ <br/>\n&gt; and bid on all sorts of exciting gift baskets and other cool stuff. The kids got toÂ <br/>\n&gt; participate, too. Another fantastic way to meet people and experience new things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I actually got on stage during the talent show. A bunch of the younger set got on <br/>\nstageÂ <br/>\n&gt; and sang &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, and I just couldn&#39;t resist! Subsequent years have <br/>\nseenÂ <br/>\n&gt; me up dancing to &quot;The Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, among other silly stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I walked to a coffee shop every day; just to escape for a little while and get some &quot;me&quot;Â <br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I watched Cartoon Network for the first time. Before the conference, we didn&#39;t have <br/>\ncableÂ <br/>\n&gt; at all; never had! But since that very first episode of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; I <br/>\nrealizedÂ <br/>\n&gt; that TV is not an instrument of the Devil; it is another wonderful way to connect with <br/>\nmyÂ <br/>\n&gt; kids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I let go. I let go of almost everything: bed times, TV control, the need to be right, the <br/>\nneedÂ <br/>\n&gt; to be on-time, the need to know where my kids were and with whom, the need to be <br/>\ninÂ <br/>\n&gt; control - and most of all, my preconceived notions that had defined unschooling in aÂ <br/>\n&gt; rigid, formulaic fashion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And most importantly, I learned. Without even trying, or wanting to, or planning to, orÂ <br/>\n&gt; even knowing it was happening. While I learned things about unschooling, to be sure, <br/>\nIÂ <br/>\n&gt; mostly learned about myself, my life, my family, my goals, my fears, and my passions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A conference can be all of this, and more. All it takes for you to have a similar, <br/>\nwonderful,Â <br/>\n&gt; life-changing experience is to come and let it happen. Look for the people who lookÂ <br/>\n&gt; peaceful and are smiling; they&#39;re the ones who know and are there to help you make <br/>\ntheÂ <br/>\n&gt; same journey.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Jeff Sabo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263835726,"authorName":"Dina","from":"&quot;Dina&quot; &lt;dapsign@...&gt;","profile":"dapsign","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why attend a conference","postDate":"1235096880","msgId":38395,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdubDRmZytkYzkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQjYwMjVCOEQzRUQxNC1CQTgtRDZFQHdlYm1haWwtbWYxNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38381,"nextInTopic":38396,"prevInTime":38394,"nextInTime":38396,"topicId":38381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thank you kelly for posting that and jeff for writing it.  i ve been on the fence about attending the Great Big Happy Life conference in April and have finally","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1871749382\">thank you kelly for posting that and jeff for writing it.  i&#39;ve been on the fence about <br/>\nattending the Great Big Happy Life conference in April and have finally decided to go.<br/>\n<br/>\ndina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The following is a post from Jeff Sabo to everyone who is contemplating attending an <br/>\nunschooling conference, noncon, or gathering.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s heartwarming to know how the conferences have touched (and continue to touch) <br/>\nfolks from around the globe.Â <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re on the fence about attending one, read on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Â ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Live as if you were to die tomorrow.

It was rough for me,Â <br/>\n&gt; because many of the answers I got were strange and new - but the people who <br/>\nansweredÂ <br/>\n&gt; me did it from the heart, with no other goal than to make me a better unschooling <br/>\ndad.Â <br/>\n&gt; And then after the meeting and all through the weekend, they each sought me out to <br/>\ntalkÂ <br/>\n&gt; one-on-one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I ran a fun shop. What a great way to meet people! Fun shops are just that; fun, fun, <br/>\nfun.Â <br/>\n&gt; We decided to make tissue paper kites ,and brought tissue paper, string, decorations,Â <br/>\n&gt; markers, glue sticks, etc. Kids and their parents just flowed in for the whole hour, and <br/>\nweÂ <br/>\n&gt; found ourselves scrambling just to catch up and keep them all supplied! But we met <br/>\nsoÂ <br/>\n&gt; many cool people and cool kids, and that helped us make connections that led to <br/>\ndeeperÂ <br/>\n&gt; conversations over that weekend - and over the years since.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I participated in the raffle and instant gratification table. I got a chance to buy raffle <br/>\nticketsÂ <br/>\n&gt; and bid on all sorts of exciting gift baskets and other cool stuff. The kids got toÂ <br/>\n&gt; participate, too. Another fantastic way to meet people and experience new things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I actually got on stage during the talent show. A bunch of the younger set got on <br/>\nstageÂ <br/>\n&gt; and sang &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;, and I just couldn&#39;t resist! Subsequent years have <br/>\nseenÂ <br/>\n&gt; me up dancing to &quot;The Time Warp&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, among other silly stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I walked to a coffee shop every day; just to escape for a little while and get some &quot;me&quot;Â <br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I watched Cartoon Network for the first time. Before the conference, we didn&#39;t have <br/>\ncableÂ <br/>\n&gt; at all; never had! But since that very first episode of &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; I <br/>\nrealizedÂ <br/>\n&gt; that TV is not an instrument of the Devil; it is another wonderful way to connect with <br/>\nmyÂ <br/>\n&gt; kids.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I let go. I let go of almost everything: bed times, TV control, the need to be right, the <br/>\nneedÂ <br/>\n&gt; to be on-time, the need to know where my kids were and with whom, the need to be <br/>\ninÂ <br/>\n&gt; control - and most of all, my preconceived notions that had defined unschooling in aÂ <br/>\n&gt; rigid, formulaic fashion.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And most importantly, I learned. Without even trying, or wanting to, or planning to, orÂ <br/>\n&gt; even knowing it was happening. While I learned things about unschooling, to be sure, <br/>\nIÂ <br/>\n&gt; mostly learned about myself, my life, my family, my goals, my fears, and my passions.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A conference can be all of this, and more. All it takes for you to have a similar, <br/>\nwonderful,Â <br/>\n&gt; life-changing experience is to come and let it happen. Look for the people who lookÂ <br/>\n&gt; peaceful and are smiling; they&#39;re the ones who know and are there to help you make <br/>\ntheÂ <br/>\n&gt; same journey.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Jeff Sabo<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Why attend a conference","postDate":"1234991970","msgId":38381,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjYwMjVCOEQzRUQxNC1CQTgtRDZFQHdlYm1haWwtbWYxNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38395,"prevInTime":38380,"nextInTime":38382,"topicId":38381,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The following is a post from Jeff Sabo to everyone who is contemplating attending an unschooling conference, noncon, or gathering.

I absolutely <br/>\nLOVE conferences; they are ways to connect with old friends, meet new ones, relax, and <br/>\ncelebrate all that is good and wonderful in our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever been to a conference? Are you uncertain about going? Is your husband or <br/>\npartner resistant? I know what that&#39;s like, and it can be scary as hell - but so incredibly <br/>\nrewarding. Read on.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time another conference approaches, it reminds me of how I felt in the months <br/>\nleading up to my first one, Live and Learn in Albuquerque in 2006. When Ginger told me <br/>\nshe wanted to go, I was pretty unsure - a conference? I mean REALLY? I&#39;ve been to a ton of <br/>\nconferences in my professional life, and they are so - - well - - boring and formal. I<br/>\nmean, Conferences are places where we all wear name badges, and sit around at tables <br/>\nforcing<br/>\n conversation with people we don&#39;t know. Conferences are where we pick up 37 <br/>\npounds of printed flyers and brochures that we&#39;ll never read again. They&#39;re places where <br/>\nwe fight to stay awake all day so we can earn the right to go back to our rooms and watch <br/>\nTV. I mean, unschooling sounded okay - - I was even kinda enjoying it. Why the hell did I <br/>\nneed to fly across the country to bore myself?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the conference got closer, my concerns took a new turn. No longer was I worried about <br/>\nbeing bored; I was worried about being overwhelmed and unaccepted. What if everyone <br/>\nthere already knew each other? What if I wasn&#39;t cool enough, or funny enough, or smart <br/>\nenough, or - - God forbid - - unschooly enough? I had serious visions that someone <br/>\nwould approach Ginger a few days into the conference, point at me, and say &quot;He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nbelong here - - I think you should reconsider this unschooling thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were flying there, I began to feel better, but still had one nagging concern; all of <br/>\nthese Dads were probably so cool, and they probably had neat non-traditional careers that <br/>\nallowed them to stay home and be with their kids all of the time, and how could I possibly <br/>\ncompete with that? Did I even deserve to be here? What the hell would I do when I got to <br/>\nthe hotel and the whole thing started?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we got there, and the rest of my life began. The entire weekend was a dream: I <br/>\nlearned, I laughed, I cried, I=2<br/>\n0relaxed, I played, I created, I asked, I answered, I dug deep, I <br/>\nslept, I stayed up all night, I followed my kids around everywhere they wanted me to and <br/>\nleft them alone when they wanted that, I was challenged, I challenged, I made amazing <br/>\nfriends from 6 months old to 70, and I came to one essential understanding of my life: <br/>\nhappiness is king and rules all. My happiness, Ginger&#39;s Kai&#39;s, Kade&#39;s, and everyone else <br/>\nthat we had a chance to interact with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here&#39;s what I did at my first conference, and why I think you should go:<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to main presentations: the ones from Ren Allen and Ben Lovejoy stood out, <br/>\nprimarily because they made me think about the love I have for my children and how <br/>\nmuch it can still deepen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to circle chats and smaller meetings. My first circle chat was with Barbara Chase, <br/>\nand while way too many brain cells have left the building to remember the exact topic, I do <br/>\nrecall feeling energized and excited by one critical thing: not everyone there was an <br/>\n&quot;expert&quot; or &quot;radical&quot;, and they were all learning and growing, just like me - even the folks <br/>\nwho have been doing it for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to SSUDS meetings. The Secret Society of Unschooling Dads is really just a cool <br/>\nacronym; there&#39;s nothing secret about it.
