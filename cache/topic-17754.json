Perhaps there is someone here who has had a <br/>\nsimilar<br/>\n  experience, and has support or advice to offer. I apologize in advance <br/>\nfor<br/>\n this long post.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is our second year schooling our nearly 11-year old daughter at <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n  Our decision to homeschool, although not made lightly, did not have <br/>\nthe<br/>\n benefit of years of contemplation, but was made over the course of 6<br/>\n  months or so while trying to work within the public system to help <br/>\nher,<br/>\n and failing. It dawned on us that homeschooling might be helpful.<br/>\n ( Anyone who is interested can read more here:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/20\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/20</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dd&#39;s mother and I are divorced. Stepmom and I provide most of the <br/>\ncare,<br/>\n  although there is a shared custody order in place. That, as well as <br/>\nthe<br/>\n  fact that dd&#39;s biological mother was not at all supportive of our <br/>\ndecision<br/>\n steered us toward a school-at-home approach. Our first year of<br/>\n homeschooling went very well, we thought ( see<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)</a>. Even biomom agreed that dd obviously<br/>\n  enjoyed this form of school, and agreed, still very reluctantly, to <br/>\nlet dd<br/>\n homeschool again this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n In the meanwhile, we have been reading and learning. We have become<br/>\n convinced that an unschooling approach might work better with dd. Over<br/>\n time we discussed the subject, and were pleasantly surprised by dd&#39;s<br/>\n insight and eagerness to try things out. ( For details, see<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart</a> and<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/69\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/69</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, this year, we have started a blended unschooling approach. We <br/>\nfollow a<br/>\n program by John Mighton for math, and plan to have some structured<br/>\n tutoring around basic grammar concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For the rest, however, we have told dd that we will allow her to <br/>\nfollow her<br/>\n  interest. We have told her that we believe that one learns best when <br/>\none<br/>\n  is learning what one is interested in. We have told her that we would <br/>\ndo<br/>\n our best to support her in following these interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n What has happened so far that is good:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. She is happier, even though we thought she was happy before.<br/>\n 2. She asked to go to the library and came back with a stack of books<br/>\n related to ancient civilizations.<br/>\n 3.

Perhaps there is someone here who has had a similar <br/>\nexperience, and has support or advice to offer. I apologize in advance for <br/>\nthis long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is our second year schooling our nearly 11-year old daughter at home. <br/>\nOur decision to homeschool, although not made lightly, did not have the <br/>\nbenefit of years of contemplation, but was made over the course of 6 <br/>\nmonths or so while trying to work within the public system to help her, <br/>\nand failing. It dawned on us that homeschooling might be helpful.<br/>\n( Anyone who is interested can read more here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/20\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/20</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nDd&#39;s mother and I are divorced. Stepmom and I provide most of the care, <br/>\nalthough there is a shared custody order in place. That, as well as the <br/>\nfact that dd&#39;s biological mother was not at all supportive of our decision <br/>\nsteered us toward a school-at-home approach. Our first year of <br/>\nhomeschooling went very well, we thought ( see <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/56)</a>. Even biomom agreed that dd obviously <br/>\nenjoyed this form of school, and agreed, still very reluctantly, to let dd <br/>\nhomeschool again this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meanwhile, we have been reading and learning. We have become <br/>\nconvinced that an unschooling approach might work better with dd. Over <br/>\ntime we discussed the subject, and were pleasantly surprised by dd&#39;s <br/>\ninsight and eagerness to try things out. ( For details, see <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/59/#usstart</a> and <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cronje.ca/article/69\">http://www.cronje.ca/article/69</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this year, we have started a blended unschooling approach. We follow a <br/>\nprogram by John Mighton for math, and plan to have some structured <br/>\ntutoring around basic grammar concepts. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the rest, however, we have told dd that we will allow her to follow her <br/>\ninterest. We have told her that we believe that one learns best when one <br/>\nis learning what one is interested in. We have told her that we would do <br/>\nour best to support her in following these interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has happened so far that is good:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. She is happier, even though we thought she was happy before.<br/>\n2. She asked to go to the library and came back with a stack of books <br/>\nrelated to ancient civilizations.<br/>\n3.
