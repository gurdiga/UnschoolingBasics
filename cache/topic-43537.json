Radical unschooling is about extending the trust that you&#39;ve got about learning being a natural event in life, one that needs little sound and fury for it to occur, to the rest of life. So, for example, you believe that math is a tool that can be accessed through every day living and you apply that line of thought to the understanding that children can make decisions and learn about food preferences without needing parents to protect them from those choices. Or you recognize that reading is something that occurs with time and a life lived in a print-rich environment and you extend that recognition to understanding that knowing your own body and sleep needs can be done without parental pressure to go to bed at a specific time. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about trust, it&#39;s a trust in humans to be inquisitive and to be able to question and explore and learn without direction or limits but with help and engagement and support. Extending that trust beyond those things that fall under subjects in school is radical unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":435652323,"authorName":"gemlily14","from":"&quot;gemlily14&quot; &lt;gemlily14@...&gt;","profile":"gemlily14","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;misusing&quot; furniture, and disagreements between parents","postDate":"1270115659","msgId":43561,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhwMXFnYitub2U4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4MjY3RTMxLTg1NEQtNEVGQS04RjkzLTcxN0IxRTg4QTE0QUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43560,"nextInTopic":43562,"prevInTime":43560,"nextInTime":43562,"topicId":43537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, new to the concept of unschooling but seems have been raising my kids along similar principles through trial and error, I just didn t have a words for it.

He feels that I should back him up and stand by him regardless. This, I struggle with. This is where arguements occur in my home.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have clarified that my ability to ask &quot;Why&quot; didn&#39;t come automatically. It was something that we transitioned to AFTER I regained my partner&#39;s trust. All of the times that I contradicted him in front of the kids eroded his self confidence and chipped away at his ability to be a parent. My partner felt like the little kid that had a teacher standing over his shoulder correcting every little mistake. I had to realize that my attempts to micro-manage my partner&#39;s interactions with the kids was undermining everything that is unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy being able to ask &quot;Why&quot; was something that we worked up to after I spent time affirming that it was okay for him to have boundaries and it was okay for him to give guidance to our children. I had to back off. In all of our discussions about how to move away from arbitrary limits, I told him that I always ask myself why when I find myself saying no. He said he had a hard time doing that because &quot;NO&quot; is such a knee-jerk reaction for him. Having lived with his mother, I completely understand that. My openly asking him &quot;Why&quot; in front of the children was a result of the two of us problem solving together to find ways to meet everyone&#39;s needs. It started out as me asking why after the fact when we were alone. In front of the kids, I had his back so to speak. I had to learn to bite my tongue on a lot of things for a while in order to regain his trust and help him build up his own confidence. Yes, there were times that I completely disagreed with him but didn&#39;t say anything in the moment. As time went on and he was more comfortable in his role as a parent, he became more comfortable with discussing our different approaches to parenting. He saw first hand how the kids respond to him versus how they respond to me. He saw first hand that the kids prefer to come to me for everything. He asked why they preferred me over him. We had TONS of discussions. I tried to listen to him and try to support him just as I had been doing with the kids. My efforts to support him eventually transitioned to me being able to ask &quot;why&quot; in the moment with the children present. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have come a long way because now the kids are comfortable with asking my partner &quot;why&quot; and he is open to listening to them when they disagree with us. This stuff doesn&#39;t happen over night. It is all very gradual and it takes time. It takes deliberate effort on my part and it isn&#39;t always easy. Now, we have a house where everyone is free to ask &quot;why&quot;. I have been asked &quot;why&quot; my fair share of times. It has been great to help me be more deliberate and thoughtful. The other benefit is that I don&#39;t have to be the know it all and I don&#39;t have to give everybody else all the answers. I let everyone find their own comfort zone even if I don&#39;t always agree with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;misusing&quot; furniture, and disagreements between parents","postDate":"1269952813","msgId":43554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvc3JmZCs4bmZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg4MkNCQURBMTZCQzRDMjJCOTE5MEJDNDlBQkVBM0EzQENvbm5pZVBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":43553,"nextInTopic":43555,"prevInTime":43553,"nextInTime":43555,"topicId":43537,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This seems like a key bit to me.

The respectful partnership needs to apply globally,<br/>\nnot just with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nA current example at our house: DS is &quot;migratory&quot; in that he prefers to<br/>\nsleep in his room during the winter but downstairs in the spring/summer.<br/>\nHowever, he also has a tendency to flip his sleep schedule around. That<br/>\nmeans he&#39;s asleep during the day. Sleeping in the living room during the<br/>\nday puts a crimp on the things DH is comfortable doing (not wanting to<br/>\nwake DS). I could just tell DH to suck it up for the next 4 to 6 months<br/>\nuntil DS starts migrating back upstairs but that would not be meeting<br/>\nDH&#39;s needs to be able to do the things he does during the day (grinding<br/>\nwheat to make baked goods - I think today he&#39;s making bagels! - or<br/>\nwashing dishes, playing on the PS3 in the living room etc). I could just<br/>\ntell DS that he has a bed and a bedroom (decorated to his<br/>\nspecifications) and that&#39;s all there is to it. That wouldn&#39;t be meeting<br/>\nDS&#39; needs to feel comfortable and able to sleep AND do all the other<br/>\nstuff he does when awake. We do (fortunately, I know not everyone has a<br/>\nlot of options in this kind of situation) have a guest room adjacent to<br/>\nthe living room - it&#39;s already got a nice bed, we fixed it up so MIL can<br/>\nspend the night on occasion if she chooses (long story). And, it&#39;s right<br/>\nwhere the cable and the network router are so the Internet connection is<br/>\nreally good there (his bedroom is about as far from there as our house<br/>\nallows). But, there&#39;s no TV (he often likes to use familiar DVDs to fall<br/>\nasleep). So, I asked DS if he was okay with giving me some time to<br/>\nponder the situation - he was. I thought, discussed with DH (to figure<br/>\nout logistical issues like setting up the cable TV), and last night we<br/>\nsat down and drew up a plan of action - some stuff can happen within the<br/>\nnext week or so (like getting a wall mount for the TV and bringing his<br/>\nTV downstairs), other stuff is going to take longer (clearing out some<br/>\nof the stuff that&#39;s gotten stored in there). But, he can move down there<br/>\nwithin the next week. DH gets the living room area free during the day,<br/>\nDS gets to be downstairs, the guest room has a door that can be closed<br/>\nfor DS&#39; privacy and to minimize sound disturbances. It&#39;s not totally<br/>\nperfect - we&#39;ve already mentioned to DS that on the odd occasion where<br/>\nwe have an overnight guest, we&#39;d prefer for him to use his upstairs room<br/>\nand he&#39;s okay with that (it&#39;s maybe twice a year). Everyone felt heard<br/>\nand respected BUT it wasn&#39;t an immediate Yes, right away, no problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s okay and even necessary to say &quot;Can you give me a<br/>\nminute/hour/day to think about that? I&#39;ve got some ideas that might work<br/>\nbut I need to figure out the best plan. I want to talk to &lt;partner&gt;<br/>\nabout it too to make sure I don&#39;t miss a good option.&quot; And make sure you<br/>\ndo touch base again in that time frame with options or a request for<br/>\nmore time &quot;hey, I am working on a plan but I need another day or two to<br/>\nget some information. Let&#39;s plan to discuss this on Friday.&quot; Obviously,<br/>\nin some circumstances the answer needs to be now (the ice cream truck is<br/>\noutside and won&#39;t be there more than 10 minutes). Over time, however,<br/>\nhabits of thought will develop in all parties that will make quicker<br/>\nanswers possible - the knee jerk No will dissipate and the attitude of<br/>\n&quot;how can we make this happen?&quot; will become the main operating idea.

Perhaps you can back off a little and give her more time. It is really hard for somebody to not only accept unschooling but completely embrace it in a short time.

Expecting your partner to slam on the breaks and veer off into the ditch might be hard for her. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it possible to radically unschool when only one parent agrees with it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>(therefore you&#39;ve got one parent trusting and respecting the child, and one<br/>\nparent only doing that some of the time), and how would you have handled the<br/>\ncouch incident?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it is possible but that makes more work for you because you have to accept everyone where they are at (even the adults). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was transitioning to intentionally unschooling, I would have told my partner to lighten up and would have given him a lecture about respecting the kids, blah, blah, blah.

I try to make a conscious effort to respect my partner&#39;s differences. When I backed off and let him be himself, it was much easier for him to transition to intentionally unschooling. Something else that I will do is help my partner explain things to the kids. There have been times that he will automatically say no to the kids or will tell them not to do something and I will just say &quot;Why?&quot; It&#39;s funny because he will either tell us why the answer is no or he will say, &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and then recant his no. Of course, I have to make sure that there is room for him to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I am just not comfortable with it.&quot; If that is the case, then I try to respect that and help communicate that to the kids. We all have boundaries and things that we are not comfortable with for various reasons.

It&#39;s probably better to respect your partner&#39;s wishes than to go head to head over something that she feels is worth saving. If, however, the couch does get damaged, there are ways to find cheap couches. We have a free one that someone up the road was off-loading, a local auction house often has couches go for fairly little money, Craig&#39;s list and charity shops (thrift stores) have relatively low cost furniture for sale or even for free. Garage sales or car boot sales can be great sources of cheap secondhand furniture. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps, a lot, to have both parents on board for unschooling to work well. Not so much because consistency of vision is important from a child&#39;s perspective, but because one parent can feel very left out and estranged from their relationship with the other people in their family if they aren&#39;t really understanding the nature of the new approach. She spoke of wanting Draven to respect things, to work to keep them nice. She&#39;s looking out for him, she&#39;s wanting to help him become a sensible young man. This crazy unschooling thing could feel like a denial of all that she understands about parenting. Go slow and be patient. Help her keep the things she needs to be kept safe from this crazy new understanding of education and childhood safe. And print out things to put where she&#39;ll read them that seem helpful or things that will maybe help her to get on board, sandradodd.com is fantastic for that as is joyfullyrejoycing.com. <br/>\n<br/>\nWork to make this easy for her.
