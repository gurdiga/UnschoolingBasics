I am though, totally open <br/>\nto others opinions and thoughts on this!! :-)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...I think 3-4 year olds are too young for speech therapy. I think<br/>\nthey&#39;re too young for any kind of schooling. I think it&#39;s damaging. I<br/>\nthink if your goal is unschooling, then getting school out of your<br/>\nlives and thinking SOONER is better than later.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nHow&#39;s that for a few opinions? (picture me smiling here, I AM serious,<br/>\nbut I&#39;m having fun too).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really believe that if you think this is all helping him, you might<br/>\nwant to read a LOT more about unschooling and see if you still think<br/>\nthat!! You might just find that a joyful, interesting home is the BEST<br/>\nthing for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16013,"nextTopicId":16306}}
