Math has never been an area <br/>\nthat has peaked my interest to explore beyond what i&#39;ve had to use in my <br/>\ndaily life.  Trusting that i am using advanced mathematical concepts, just <br/>\nnot aware of the labels or descriptions of such.  Introducing or recognizing <br/>\nopportunities to incorporate challenging or advanced math information <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come as naturally to me as introducing other areas that i do have <br/>\nstrong personal experience or interest.  This has been a concern of dh&#39;s.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve always recognized the reality of our children being more heavily <br/>\nexposed to what we as their parents have more knowledge and experience.  I <br/>\nalso know that when their interest reaches beyond mine in any area i help <br/>\nthem search out resources that will take them further than what my knowledge <br/>\nbase is...whether it be sciences, sewing or gymnastics - because they are <br/>\ninterested and i remain forever curious.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years, whenever i read your posts to dh about math - he&#39;ll say - <br/>\nthat&#39;s easy for her to say, mathematically thinking is second nature to her, <br/>\nnot to us, how will our kids get exposed to this if we don&#39;t consciously put <br/>\nit infront of them.  I&#39;ve been more relaxed about this than he would like me <br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I think parents can go ahead and introduce fun math stuff into games<br/>\n&gt;or art projects or in cooking or sewing or carpentry, etc., as long<br/>\n&gt;as they&#39;re remembering that the point of a game is to have fun, the<br/>\n&gt;point of art is to be creative, the point of cooking is to make good<br/>\n&gt;food, and so on - the learning is incidental.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;If you just remember the basic unschooling principal of supporting<br/>\n&gt;our kids&#39; interests by providing ways to do more, expand, add to,<br/>\n&gt;make connections, etc., then if you&#39;re kid is interested in playing a<br/>\n&gt;certain game, you&#39;ll naturally think of other similar games he might<br/>\n&gt;enjoy, ways to expand the game, to relate it to other interests, to<br/>\n&gt;add to it and modify it, and so on. Just like with any other<br/>\n&gt;interest, except that there are lots of parents who simply won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think about adding to it in ways that involve mathematics because<br/>\n&gt;they avoid math without even realizing they&#39;re doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Guilty, by lack of knowledge.

I&#39;ve been<br/>\n&gt;diligently reading the &quot;online&quot; resources that keep popping up on<br/>\n&gt;this board, such as Sandra Dodd, Danielle Conger, Joyce Fetterol and<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;ve seen them all mention &quot;math games&quot;.  Sandra even gave a link to<br/>\n&gt;Pam Sarooshian&#39;s link on dice games which I&#39;ve also used with my son.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To answer whether or not I force the issue or does he, well in the<br/>\n&gt;beginning of our school year I had to be creative and come up with<br/>\n&gt;ways to help him &quot;learn&quot; what was needed in our curriculum.  Since<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;s not a sit down kind of kid, I played games.  So, yes, in the<br/>\n&gt;beginning I did impose it upon him.  However now, as we are working<br/>\n&gt;toward an unschooling life, I don&#39;t force these ideas on him.  He<br/>\n&gt;will ask to play my math games just as frequently as he will ask to<br/>\n&gt;play Trouble or Zathura, etc.  Although since his undertanding has<br/>\n&gt;increased, he asks less and less and that is fine with me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The long and short of it is that Jarod likes math.  He questions me<br/>\n&gt;everyday about money, how long until we visit Grandma, when are my<br/>\n&gt;school friends coming home, and even addition such as 800+200=1000.<br/>\n&gt;I don&#39;t understand how playing games with him, even ones I&#39;ve made up<br/>\n&gt;to help with his math understanding cannot be unschooling.  I&#39;m not<br/>\n&gt;forcing him to look at flash cards, or do endless problems on a<br/>\n&gt;worksheet, or drilling him, I&#39;m just finding a way to reinforce sums<br/>\n&gt;of 10 so that when he wants to know if 800+200=1000 (and he does),<br/>\n&gt;he&#39;ll know how to get there.  I truly want him to understand<br/>\n&gt;the &quot;process&quot; rather than the &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Please feel to enlighten me further if I am way out in left<br/>\n&gt;field. :-)  I appreciate your input.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;Robin<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lisa Heyman&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s always fun to find new ways to challenge the mind with games<br/>\n&gt;that can get old.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My question would be whose idea was it to modify the game and for<br/>\n&gt;what purpose?

THAT is also an example of an  <br/>\nunschooled life. And there is nothing wrong with thinking that the  <br/>\nnew twist will help our kid learn something that we think he might  <br/>\nreally like to learn, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust worries me that sometimes people treat math stuff differently  <br/>\nthan other stuff. If you watched a movie that your child really  <br/>\nliked, would you hesitate to recommend another movie that you thought  <br/>\nhe&#39;d also like? So, if you&#39;re playing a game and you think, &quot;Oh, I  <br/>\nbet he&#39;d enjoy it if we changed the rules a little - make it a bit  <br/>\nmore challenging by introducing some addition,&quot; that&#39;s cool, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a fine line between supporting learning versus pushing it on  <br/>\nour kids. We have to know them really well. We have to be sensitive.  <br/>\nWe have to know that this is a kid who will enjoy learning this new  <br/>\nthing and appreciate being a little challenged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with math, in particular, is that so many parents are,  <br/>\nthemselves, overly anxious and sometimes even phobic about it. So, I  <br/>\nthink most people might need to be just a smidgen on the lookout for  <br/>\nways to support math learning in natural and fun ways. Supporting  <br/>\nother kinds of learning might come more naturally to the parents. If  <br/>\nparents are math-anxious, they&#39;ll avoid math and their kids will miss  <br/>\nout on the support that they could have had if the parents had been  <br/>\nmore comfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents can go ahead and introduce fun math stuff into games  <br/>\nor art projects or in cooking or sewing or carpentry, etc., as long  <br/>\nas they&#39;re remembering that the point of a game is to have fun, the  <br/>\npoint of art is to be creative, the point of cooking is to make good  <br/>\nfood, and so on - the learning is incidental.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you just remember the basic unschooling principal of supporting  <br/>\nour kids&#39; interests by providing ways to do more, expand, add to,  <br/>\nmake connections, etc., then if you&#39;re kid is interested in playing a  <br/>\ncertain game, you&#39;ll naturally think of other similar games he might  <br/>\nenjoy, ways to expand the game, to relate it to other interests, to  <br/>\nadd to it and modify it, and so on. Just like with any other  <br/>\ninterest, except that there are lots of parents who simply won&#39;t  <br/>\nthink about adding to it in ways that involve mathematics because  <br/>\nthey avoid math without even realizing they&#39;re doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 2, 2007, at 7:12 PM, Lisa Heyman wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My question would be whose idea was it to modify the game and for what<br/>\n&gt; purpose?

It may be that you don&#39;t have to test.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94582929,"authorName":"SandyL2002@aol.com","from":"SandyL2002@...","profile":"twogreatkids2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Newbie here with questions of course! ;-)","postDate":"1172778065","msgId":21792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ1ZS4zNmIzOTgzLjMzMTg4NjUxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":21784,"nextInTopic":21794,"prevInTime":21791,"nextInTime":21793,"topicId":21784,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/1/2007 2:03:37 P.M.

I loved school so I have a lot of <br/>\ndeschooling to do for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely think my 7yo ds will benefit from unschooling.  He&#39;s <br/>\nextremely bright, but a reluctant reader.  Understands higher math <br/>\nconcepts, but struggles with simple math sometimes.  Very stong-<br/>\nwilled (gets from his mom), very tender (gets from his dad) and has <br/>\nso much energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 questions to start. (I have been reading posts here and the <br/>\nsuggested links-thank you for everything!)<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Carschooling - he does his best thinking in the car.  I&#39;m still <br/>\nconfused on him deciding what/when to learn and how I am to help him <br/>\nwith that.  For instance, on a recent 20 minute trip to an art class, <br/>\nled by his questioning, we discussed religion, toxic waste, volcanos, <br/>\nbeing famous, pet ownership, geology and whether kryptonite was <br/>\nreal.  Now that is a lot to cover in 20 minutes, but I did my best. <br/>\nlol.  Do I write all these topics down and run like crazy to the <br/>\nlibrary or look them all up online and show him links?  We do have <br/>\nbooks on some of his favorite topics, but he is not interested in <br/>\nreading or being read to (even though, he wanted us to read many <br/>\nbooks per night when he was younger).  How does this work???<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Testing is fast approaching and I am getting nervous.  On the one <br/>\nhand, I think he could easily pass the first grade CAT test based on <br/>\nwhat I know of our state requirements for knowledge (in VA), but on <br/>\nthe other hand, I&#39;m not POSITIVE if he can.  I don&#39;t know what is on <br/>\nthe test and I&#39;ll have to read it for him - I hope that is <br/>\nallowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize he is young and would like to let him learn at his pace, <br/>\nbut with state requirements over my head...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny understanding and help with this is much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21925,"nextTopicId":21913}}
