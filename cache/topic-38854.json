So we try to make sure we take pictures (I am missing a working digi cam right now and have been using disposable ones we get developed on CD at Walmart) and send them to everyone. I fix them up myself and we take pictures of everything. Our family is about 6 hours away from us so we upload to Walgreens, pay for the prints that they have requested and they can pick them up when it is convenient for them. This is accomplishing two things. Everyone gets current pictures and it displays the things that they are doing. We have taken pictures of our daughter engrossed in a book. Our son building blocks, field trips, park days, you name it. They get to see &quot;school&quot; photos and see that the kids are not just sitting doing nothing, though there are plenty of those as well come to think of it. We have even taken pictures of art work or scanned it in and done the same thing. It has lessened the negative attitude on<br/>\nmany sides. As for the always present question on socialization I have pictures of the kids playing with their friends, talking to the librarian, etc. Excellent documentary of their lives. I also often email my daughter&#39;s writings that she chooses to different family members. I have taken down short stories my son has come up with and sent those as well. I make sure everyone has access to our homeschool blog, which needs updating. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a lot of work but we get to show off everything, we have fun and well the family is coming around to our side slowly but surely. Of course my younger brothers, who are not parents themsevles yet, have always thought Sissy was weird so their views are nothing new. <br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\nhttp://tammycurry. blogspot. com/<br/>\nhttp://crazy- homeschool- adventures. blogspot. com/<br/>\nhttp://myspace. com/mamabeart00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________ _________ _________ __<br/>\nFrom: Karen James &lt;semajrak@gmail. com&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 10, 2009 7:42:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Parents and unschooling. ..<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s parents have been generally unsupportive of our ways of living<br/>\nsince we had our son, who is now 6 years old. We had a period of about two<br/>\nyears where we had very little contact with them. Without going into<br/>\ndetail, I will just say that their constant criticism of our parenting<br/>\ndecisions finally came to an unhappy, but inevitable temporary conclusion.<br/>\nSince that time, I have been trying to work on being compassionate toward<br/>\nthem--understanding that their ways of living are good and decent, and that<br/>\nthey undoubtedly wish the best for us. Unfortunately, their idea of &quot;best&quot;<br/>\nis *their* idea exclusively, and if we don&#39;t conform to that, we are<br/>\nbombarded with constant questions, criticisms and strange passive aggressive<br/>\nbehaviours. Regardless, we have chosen to continue our way of life with our<br/>\nson, which includes unschooling him--&quot;homeschooling &quot; to them (the term<br/>\nunschooling, as well as the lifestyle choice, would be too threatening a<br/>\nconcept for them to grasp openly). They seem absolutely unwilling to even<br/>\naccept the idea of our keeping our son out of school. Every conversation<br/>\nthey have with our son, they ask him how school is going. When he says we<br/>\nhomeschool, they give him the silent treatment. Just the other day they<br/>\nsent a card addressed to our son asking for a &quot;school photo&quot; of him, because<br/>\nthey have one of their other grandson.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is how do I deal with this? I want to be understanding of their<br/>\nbeliefs and fears, however, they are not easy to talk to, and they both feel<br/>\nincredibly threatened by people who choose to live differently from them. I<br/>\nalso want our son to have a decent relationship with his grandparents, aunt<br/>\nand cousin. Has anyone had this experience with family or friends?

I&#39;m assuming you could do the same thing at a commercial photo place...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the photo thing is only one little part, but maybe for your relatives it&#39;s important to have &quot;things&quot; they can show their friends about their grandkids...and the photo is tangible proof of something?  Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a similar situation with my MIL...we just don&#39;t talk about our home (un) schooling life with her...just try to focus on all the cool, fun, &quot;educational&quot; things we are doing (she&#39;s a former school teacher...).

So we try to make sure we take pictures (I am missing a working digi cam right now and have been using disposable ones we get developed on CD at Walmart) and send them to everyone. I fix them up myself and we take pictures of everything. Our family is about 6 hours away from us so we upload to Walgreens, pay for the prints that they have requested and they can pick them up when it is convenient for them. This is accomplishing two things. Everyone gets current pictures and it displays the things that they are doing. We have taken pictures of our daughter engrossed in a book. Our son building blocks, field trips, park days, you name it. They get to see &quot;school&quot; photos and see that the kids are not just sitting doing nothing, though there are plenty of those as well come to think of it. We have even taken pictures of art work or scanned it in and done the same thing. It has lessened the negative attitude on<br/>\n many sides. As for the always present question on socialization I have pictures of the kids playing with their friends, talking to the librarian, etc. Excellent documentary of their lives. I also often email my daughter&#39;s writings that she chooses to different family members. I have taken down short stories my son has come up with and sent those as well. I make sure everyone has access to our homeschool blog, which needs updating. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a lot of work but we get to show off everything, we have fun and well the family is coming around to our side slowly but surely. Of course my younger brothers, who are not parents themsevles yet, have always thought Sissy was weird so their views are nothing new.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/mamabeart00\">http://myspace.com/mamabeart00</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Karen James &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:semajrak@...\">semajrak@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 10, 2009 7:42:57 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Parents and unschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s parents have been generally unsupportive of our ways of living<br/>\nsince we had our son, who is now 6 years old.
