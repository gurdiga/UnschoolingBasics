If you didn&#39;t finish high school, you should plan on<br/>\nmaybe<br/>\n  a  year or less. And it&#39;s just a rule of thumb----sensitive people tend to<br/>\n  take  longer to rid themselves of the damage done by school. Folks who<br/>\nkind of<br/>\n  blew  off school to begin with take less time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  DEschooling is allowing yourself time to forget about school----to start<br/>\n  making school a part of your past---NOT your present or future. Think of<br/>\nit like<br/>\n  summer vacation that never ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s the time you spend getting rid of words like &quot;educational&quot; and<br/>\n  &quot;workbooks&quot; and &quot;should&quot; and &quot;must&quot; and &quot;texts&quot; &quot;schoolyear&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;back-to-school&quot;  and<br/>\n  &quot;assignment&quot;----you know, &quot;schoolspeak&quot;. Banish these words from your<br/>\n  vocabulary.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s also the time for you to start seeing value in what school<br/>\n  denigrates---like TV and video games and mudpuddles and staring into<br/>\nspace. To see value<br/>\n  in skateboarding and horseback riding and knitting and  making that same<br/>\nexact<br/>\n  mark in the middle of the 500th piece of paper! It&#39;s  seeing ----and<br/>\n  SEEKING---value in what your child finds interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n  UNschooling, on the other hand, is knowing that these things have just as<br/>\n  much value. Unschooling understands that workbooks and coloring books are<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  same. That TV and books are equal ways to take in information. That<br/>\nblowing<br/>\n  buubles in milk is just as scientific as a laboratory experiment.<br/>\nUnschooling is<br/>\n  understanding that connections are made daily---sometimes big ones and<br/>\n  sometimes  little ones----but that those little dots WILL connect sometime<br/>\nin the<br/>\n  future.  Unschooling is knowing that our brains&#39; capacities are<br/>\nlimitless---and<br/>\n  that we  keep on learning until we die---and that NO one knows better than<br/>\nwe<br/>\n  do what we  need to know and when.<br/>\n<br/>\n  DEschooling is hard. Really hard, because we&#39;ve been brainwashed to<br/>\ndevalue<br/>\n  what is not &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling is much easier (AFTER you&#39;ve deschooled) because it just makes<br/>\n  sense. It just takes a while to get to level of understanding! &lt;g&gt; And to<br/>\n  realize that *everything* is educational. It&#39;s just changing your<br/>\ndefinition<br/>\n  &quot;educational&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  So basically, you&#39;ve misread or misunderstood DEschooling and UNschooling.<br/>\n  DEschooling is a process to get rid of schoolthink and takes as long as it<br/>\n  takes. UNschooling is living your life as if school didn&#39;t exist.

As a rule of thumb, some people have suggested that it takes about 1 month for each year of school.   During the &quot;deschooling&quot; transition period, some people find that it seems worse before it seems better.  My children have never been to school and my own deschooling was so gradual I didn&#39;t pay attention to how long it took. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Unschooling&quot; is what we are doing and what this list is about. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Jeanne Goodman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, July 09, 2004 10:19 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Really basic question about unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So I&#39;m a little confused.

I&#39;ve been told to unschool for one month for each <br/>\nyear of  school -- but it sounds as though most of you unschool all the time. <br/>\nSo what&#39;s  it supposed to be?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou need to DEschool for one month for each year you were in school.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you have a master&#39;s degree, it might take two years before you&#39;ve gotten  <br/>\nrid of schoolthink. If you didn&#39;t finish high school, you should plan on maybe <br/>\na  year or less. And it&#39;s just a rule of thumb----sensitive people tend to <br/>\ntake  longer to rid themselves of the damage done by school. Folks who kind of <br/>\nblew  off school to begin with take less time.<br/>\n <br/>\nDEschooling is allowing yourself time to forget about school----to start  <br/>\nmaking school a part of your past---NOT your present or future. Think of  it like <br/>\nsummer vacation that never ends.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s the time you spend getting rid of words like &quot;educational&quot; and  <br/>\n&quot;workbooks&quot; and &quot;should&quot; and &quot;must&quot; and &quot;texts&quot; &quot;schoolyear&quot; or &quot;back-to-school&quot;  and <br/>\n&quot;assignment&quot;----you know, &quot;schoolspeak&quot;. Banish these words from your  <br/>\nvocabulary.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s also the time for you to start seeing value in what school  <br/>\ndenigrates---like TV and video games and mudpuddles and staring into  space. To see value <br/>\nin skateboarding and horseback riding and knitting and  making that same exact <br/>\nmark in the middle of the 500th piece of paper! It&#39;s  seeing ----and <br/>\nSEEKING---value in what your child finds interesting.<br/>\n <br/>\nUNschooling, on the other hand, is knowing that these things have just as  <br/>\nmuch value. Unschooling understands that workbooks and coloring books are the  <br/>\nsame. That TV and books are equal ways to take in information. That blowing  <br/>\nbuubles in milk is just as scientific as a laboratory experiment. Unschooling is <br/>\n understanding that connections are made daily---sometimes big ones and <br/>\nsometimes  little ones----but that those little dots WILL connect sometime in the <br/>\nfuture.  Unschooling is knowing that our brains&#39; capacities are limitless---and <br/>\nthat we  keep on learning until we die---and that NO one knows better than we <br/>\ndo what we  need to know and when.<br/>\n <br/>\nDEschooling is hard. Really hard, because we&#39;ve been brainwashed to devalue  <br/>\nwhat is not &quot;educational&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling is much easier (AFTER you&#39;ve deschooled) because it just makes  <br/>\nsense. It just takes a while to get to level of understanding! &lt;g&gt; And to  <br/>\nrealize that *everything* is educational. It&#39;s just changing your definition  <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo basically, you&#39;ve misread or misunderstood DEschooling and UNschooling.  <br/>\nDEschooling is a process to get rid of schoolthink and takes as long as it  <br/>\ntakes. UNschooling is living your life as if school didn&#39;t exist. We unschool  <br/>\nALL the time. <br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83822299,"authorName":"Jeanne Goodman","from":"&quot;Jeanne Goodman&quot; &lt;goodmanj@...&gt;","profile":"desksideguru","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Really basic question about unschooling","postDate":"1089382798","msgId":1667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFmZjAwMWM0NjVjMCQwMjg0Y2I4MCQ2NTAwYThjMEBMYXB0b3A+","referencesHeader":"PDFlMi4yNGVlYjYxOS4yZTFmNmIzYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1672,"prevInTime":1666,"nextInTime":1668,"topicId":1667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So I m a little confused.
