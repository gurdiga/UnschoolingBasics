The older one would stay home 24/7 and the younger would be <br/>\ngone all the time.  My older one always brings a note book or a book <br/>\nto read when she knows we are going somewhere she does not like to <br/>\ngo.  My younger one is always complaing of boredom at home... this is <br/>\nfrustrating.  I wish she would find something that really interested <br/>\nher... but so far no hobbies.  She does like to play her cello and <br/>\ndance, tried soccer, and gymnastics.  I do have loads of books, <br/>\nencyclopedias, arts crafts, paint, yarn, you name it I have it (I <br/>\nlove to craft myself).  We live on a lake but she really just bounces <br/>\naround.  Has a short attention span and loads of energy.  She loves <br/>\nto help so I let her.  Shes very smart as they all are, just night <br/>\nand day different from my 9yo.  We are trying differnt things to see <br/>\nwhere some interest lies...she did check out a bunch of pengin books <br/>\nfrom the library....I just think at times she is just a free spirit <br/>\nand likes to bounce around..  sorry for the run on.
