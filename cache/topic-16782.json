The more rushed I feel to get things done at a specific time, the worse my parenting is.  When I watch the children and wait for them to be ready, everything goes much smoother.  I can keep in mind what we have to do each day and the amount of time we need to do it.  But I can also be realilistic about when we have to do it.  The store is open all day, the library til 8, the nursery at the YMCA till 12.  When I don&#39;t rush the children just to keep to a schedule, everything runs so much smoother.  <br/>\n <br/>\n   I&#39;m not sure this is related, but it has been on my mind lately.

I had a 2 yr old and a 5 yr old.  I started trying to homeschool very lightly but came to realize very quickly that even light was not right for my son.  I had dismissed unschooling when I first heard about it about 2 yrs prior to my starting our homeschooling journey.  Unfortunately, I dismissed it without doing my research first.  BUT, all things happen for a reason.  Because I realized that unschooling was actually the way that my family HAD to go in order for me to maintain my commitment to peaceful parenting and truly respecting my children as people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came to realize that my main issue was that I really did not understand how young children learn.  I learned of John Holt from another group that I was part of then and went and read two of his books.  I fell in love with unschooling from then on.  It was not until I joined this group that I came to understand that there is a difference between unschooling and radical unschooling.  I have accepted radical unschooling as the lifestyle that most fits my families personality.  But what I have learned from Holt has been key to my giving into to the process of how children learn and allowing it to unfold naturally in my children.  Being part of this group has helped not only embrace accepting my children learning in their own way and time but also has helped me to stay firmly commited to extending that same perspective to the way we live in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard others really praise Sandra Dodd and recently I have decided to buy a book by Rue Cream&#39;s book.  I don&#39;t have the name of it but if you do a search of the archives, you will easily find the name of her book.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter one year I am really just now getting comfortable.  I am now at a place that I want to continue to immerse myself in reading all that I can about unschooling as we continue learning through living.  I wish you all the best and encourage you to be very gentle with yourself.  Unschooling initially is more about the parents unschooling themselves than anything else.  After a while you will see that children are learning all that the time.  And what I enjoy the most is learning with my children.  It has helped me to get in a really good place with my inner girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you all the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: &quot;feychile113&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:feychile113@...\">feychile113@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/26 Sat PM 12:22:09 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] New Member Asking for Reading Material<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted an intro the other day, but I haven&#39;t seen it yet.
