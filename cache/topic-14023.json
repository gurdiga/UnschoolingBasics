Saying BUT lessens the meaning of the first part.<br/>\nFor instance in your first example, you are disqualifying/negating Ren&#39;s<br/>\ndisorganization by making up for the fact that she is creative.  the paper<br/>\nis rough, but it is ok (negated) because it does what I need it to (I&#39;m<br/>\npresuming some sort of art paper).  Green is too bright but (negate) if we<br/>\nadd yellow it won&#39;t be green anymore.  And Jalen doesn&#39;t love visiting you<br/>\nas much as ice cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve taken quite a few human relations courses (thanks to LLL and rape<br/>\ncrisis counselling) and this is one thing we are taught over and over.  When<br/>\nspeaking with people try to find ways of not using the words but and<br/>\nhowever.  For instance if someone says, &quot;Can you watch my kids on Friday&quot;<br/>\nand you *really* don&#39;t want to (or can&#39;t) watch their kids don&#39;t say, &quot;I<br/>\nwould love to BUT I have something else to do.&quot; Simply say, &quot;That doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork for me as I have something else to do that day.&quot;  I remember the first<br/>\ntime that I was severely chastized for using the word but when communicating<br/>\nin a professional forum (Lactation mailing list) by someone that I greatly<br/>\nadmired.  It was the first time that I had ever heard that and I believe<br/>\nthat I did have a few examples like Ren&#39;s trying to prove my point and she<br/>\nnot so kindly pointed out how while I thought that they were not negating<br/>\nthe first half that they truly were.  &quot;But&quot; can lessen the importance of the<br/>\nfirst half of a sentence.  If you wanted to show yourself in a positive<br/>\nsense (using your disorganized example) you could much better express it by<br/>\nsaying, &quot;Ren manages to create truly amazing things through a chaordic<br/>\nmethod!&quot; (Chaord is order out of chaos.)   &quot;While the paper is really rough,<br/>\nit has the perfect absorbability for the project I am working on.&quot;  &quot;Adding<br/>\nyellow to Kelly green is a great way of mellowing out the brightness.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Jalen is busy at the moment and has plans to go get ice cream.  Would you<br/>\nlike to join us (OR Perhaps we could see you when we get back OR Another day<br/>\nwould be better for us to visit.)&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course it takes time to be able to work to a point of remembering to talk<br/>\nthat way.  And I tend to fail at it myself from time to time!  Sometimes,<br/>\nthough, the word but is a perfectly good word to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Making amends","postDate":"1149372394","msgId":14023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1dDE1YStmMjdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14030,"prevInTime":14022,"nextInTime":14024,"topicId":14023,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" actually, anytime you say the word but it negates everything you said before but.
