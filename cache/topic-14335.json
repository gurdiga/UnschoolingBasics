Our first five were girls...the last <br/>\ntwo boys.  What a WORLD of difference.  They truely are from <br/>\nMars!  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur oldest boy, Andrew, is 14, and he has wanted to go into the <br/>\nmilitary ever since he was five-years-old.  He loves everything guns <br/>\nand knives.  He loves to explore martial arts.  He thinks the idea <br/>\nof killing a squirrel or a bird is a-okay, and in the right instance <br/>\nmaybe even funny.  Andrew is also a natural shot and great hunter.  <br/>\nHe views violence in war as necessary and acceptable.  On the flip <br/>\nside he is excellent with young children, extremely helpful, <br/>\ncompassionate, a good writer and a wonderful artist who wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur youngest boy, Adrian, is 12, and he loves &quot;violent&quot; video games, <br/>\nb.b. guns, South Park, Joe Cartoon and looks forward to joining Pat <br/>\nand Andrew for his first hunt this fall even though he&#39;s a <br/>\nvegetarian.  On the flip side he is thoughtful, knowledgable about <br/>\nsmall animals and history, has extreme polital views and interests <br/>\nand is also good with young children.  He would never hurt anyone <br/>\nand thinks senseless killing is, well, senseless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that our boys can come as a shock to us moms at times.  <br/>\nThere were times that Adrian&#39;s &quot;dark side&quot; made me raise an eyebrow <br/>\nhere and there, but I just paid close attention to him.  I listened <br/>\nmore and got as in tune with him as I possibly could.  From my <br/>\nexperience it seems that boys, maybe not all of them...but at least <br/>\nsome of them, go through a real &quot;snakes and snails&quot; phase.  They are <br/>\nSO different than girls, and I&#39;m a girl.  So, I don&#39;t get A LOT <br/>\nabout them.  When it comes to this I am VERY grateful that my <br/>\nhusband is around.  I also try to read about boys specifically.  It <br/>\nreally does help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to be VERY, VERY open to them.  They talk about <br/>\ndisgusting stuff that involves bodily fluids, bodily sounds and <br/>\nnatural urges.  They talk about killing and hurting and like <br/>\naggressive things.  That&#39;s not my bag, but I do talk and laugh with <br/>\nthem.  If something REALLY grosses me out, or I just can&#39;t handle <br/>\nthe way they are talking, I will comment something to the tune <br/>\nof, &quot;Okay, ladies are present.&quot; or, &quot;Mom&#39;s REALLY don&#39;t NEED to know <br/>\nthat!&quot;  This is always with a smile, and they tend to laugh, but <br/>\nthey do back it off a bit to respect my poor, little brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever &quot;get&quot; boys, but I do know we have <br/>\nexcellent relationships with eachother.  It didn&#39;t start this way, <br/>\nbut it became open and wonderful by one means.  Someone else <br/>\nmentioned it earlier, *I* changed, not them.  It is SO true that <br/>\nyour behavior will change your children.  Openness is ESSENTIAL for <br/>\na mom to have a successful relationship with her son...not that it <br/>\nisn&#39;t essential for other things too, we just happen to be talking <br/>\nabout boys right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my two-cents worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179628783,"authorName":"Malinda Mills","from":"&quot;Malinda Mills&quot; &lt;saprswife@...&gt;","profile":"saprswife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: what it takes to unschool","postDate":"1149991145","msgId":14357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxOWQwMWM2OGNmYSRhMDA4NTBkMCQwOGJkZmVhOUBNQUxJTkRBPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU2ZmluaSsyZTI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14350,"nextInTopic":14360,"prevInTime":14356,"nextInTime":14358,"topicId":14335,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1055450432\">&lt;&lt;My dh is in the Air Force and is very <br/>\nknowledgeable about weapons.
