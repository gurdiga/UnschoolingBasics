It is truly a remarkable process and this week I have seen some changes that have made it all worthwhile.  The best thing I can suggest and I am sure many of the long time unschoolers will have more great ideas to get you started as they have certainly been a shoulder for me to lean on, is to allow the doing nothing, to talk to yourself about your panic and try to understand where it is coming from.  I have been surprised by all my judgements and all my panic about what my children have been choosing to do..especially what I see as doing nothing and what I see as waisted time on the computer and watching movies.  It really is about letting learning come from inside them and valuing what they choose.  I have seen many things differently this<br/>\n week.  Lukas spent hours figuring out Runescape yesterday, downloading, signing up, working through the tutorial etc.  He was so proud of himself for figuring it out all on his own.  Then Kora who loves to watch movies endlessly has spent the last few days asking to make movies with the video camera.  Today she wrote a plot and assigned everyone a role.  It is really about patience....donna<br/>\nNicole Goble &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bigmamagoble@...\">bigmamagoble@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          My name is Nikki and I have been homeschooling for 3<br/>\nyears.
