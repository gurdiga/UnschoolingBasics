I would like to invite you to another yahoo list that is for  <br/>\nhelping us see our &quot;different&quot; children differently.  It is  &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nTake a break from &quot;doing&quot; anything except things you all really  enjoy.  If <br/>\nyour child wants to work a puzzle, do one, but for the purpose  of having fun, <br/>\nnot learning.  All the knowledge will come, don&#39;t  worry.  As a day care <br/>\nteacher, you are coming from the mindset that you  have to have a specific <br/>\neducational purpose for all things, unschooling is about  letting go of the purpose <br/>\nand letting learning happen naturally.  Because  it does!<br/>\n <br/>\nI know it is difficult with  children that are &quot;behind&quot; because you  have <br/>\nthat extra worry that they will never catch up.  What unschooling has  taught me <br/>\nis that there were so many things that closed my son down to learning  and my <br/>\ngoal has been to not teach him things, but open up his world so that he  could <br/>\nlearn.  I believe all children, especially children with challenges  to <br/>\nlearning, need to not have blinders put on, but freedom to explore what  interests <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is nearly nine and in no way a typical nine year old.  But  he is <br/>\nhappy with himself and confident and doesn&#39;t know that he is behind.   He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave the stress of not being able to perform a task that mommy has  set for <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n <br/>\nA few months ago, without any provocation that I am aware of, he decided to  <br/>\nlearn to tie his shoes.  I never made a big deal about it, we just bought  <br/>\nvelcro-fastened ones.  One day I noticed he was fiddling with his bathing  suit <br/>\nlace up thing.  He asked me to show him a bow.  I did.   Several times over the <br/>\nnext weeks, he would ask me to show him, but he wanted no  help doing it <br/>\nhimself.  Yes there were times he was frustrated and I asked  him if he wanted me <br/>\nto help him, he didn&#39;t.  But he would ask me to show  him, and I would, <br/>\njoyfully.  Finally, he asked me to help, but he only a  little.  Then one day, he <br/>\ncould tie his swimsuit.  Then he could tie  his shoes.  On his own time, in his <br/>\nown way.  He was so proud of  himself.  So much more wonderful than me saying <br/>\n&quot;it is time for you to  learn how to tie your shoes.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe point is, it happens!  My son is not going to be 18, unable to tie  his <br/>\nshoes because I never bothered to &quot;teach&quot; him.  Children naturally  want to <br/>\nlearn what adults do (if they didn&#39;t the species would have died out  long ago) <br/>\nunless we put up blinders and blocks and tell them what and how to do  <br/>\neverything.  My son sees me as a trusted partner to help him when  he needs help, not <br/>\nas the person in charge of him and his learning.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m rambling.   Read here in the archives.  We&#39;ve  had several <br/>\ngood discussions with new people in the past weeks.
