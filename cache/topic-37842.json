He was 6 at the<br/>\ntime....he agreed that he could certainly wait and thought of some<br/>\nother things he would like Santa to bring.   This year my brother was<br/>\nable to find a local store that had a good steady supply of Wii&#39;s and<br/>\ngot one for Jack to have at Christmas.   He got one for his house and<br/>\nmy kids played with it several times before Christmas... Jack and<br/>\nAinsley (age 13) frequently fight and argue about video games and<br/>\nother things so we were a bit worried since they were now both talking<br/>\nabout wanting a Wii for Christmas.    We decided that we would not<br/>\ntalk about the Wii as far as it being a Christmas present so they both<br/>\nhad other things on their Christmas lists this year.  It ended up that<br/>\nSanta brought both of them a few games and then brought the actual<br/>\nsystem as a family gift... it was left in a neutral spot not belonging<br/>\nto anyone in the family room instead of in or near anyone&#39;s &quot;pile&quot; of<br/>\nSanta gifts.   Surprisingly it&#39;s worked out well... they each &quot;own&quot; a<br/>\nfew games that are of interest to the other but the system belongs to<br/>\nus all... they have been able to work out sharing pretty well for the<br/>\nmost part.   The first few days were a little hard because it was new<br/>\nand everyone wanted to play but they have been able to work out a<br/>\npretty good system of sharing since then.   I think it helps that we<br/>\nall like it and everyone wants to play and lots of the games are only<br/>\nfun if you play together.   There are days when one will play alot but<br/>\nso far they have worked it out without alot of parental involvement so<br/>\nthat everyone is happy.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it was said that all the kids were saving their money for<br/>\nthe Wii... maybe it would work out better if they saved their money to<br/>\nbuy games and mom and dad saved their money to buy the actual system.<br/>\n Or I suppose if everyone is saving towards it you could sit down and<br/>\nfigure out what games you would buy to go with it so that everything<br/>\nbelonged to everyone.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s also important to remember that different kids &quot;need&quot;<br/>\ndifferent things... my 13 yr old has autism and sees things in a<br/>\ndifferent way than my other 3 kids... they understand that and they<br/>\nknow that &quot;fair&quot;  for our family is that everyone gets what they need<br/>\nrather than getting the &quot;same&quot;.

For us, during the times  <br/>\nwhen one or more kids was not finding it easy to share, it helped to  <br/>\nclearly define who things belonged to - it would have been a set-up  <br/>\nfor conflict for the kids to all own one game system together. Even  <br/>\nnow, my kids seem very very generous, but they do like to know which  <br/>\nthings belong to whom. They &quot;lend&quot; each other their games, books,  <br/>\nclothing, music, etc., constantly, but they like to be asked before  <br/>\nanybody borrows something from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - what I&#39;m saying is - if your older son owned the Wii, it would be  <br/>\nhis and he could then be generous with it if he wanted to be, and that  <br/>\nis a FAR nicer feeling than being forced to share. I don&#39;t think being  <br/>\nforced to share encourages generosity at all, quite the opposite. When  <br/>\nproperty rights are clearly defined, it is a lot easier for the kids  <br/>\nto make their own deals, work out how to share something. Yes, it is  <br/>\npossible that your son will absolutely refuse to share at all, and I  <br/>\nthink that should be allowed and supported. He ought to have things he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to share. I honestly believe that when he feels  <br/>\ncomfortable about his own control over his own things, he&#39;ll feel  <br/>\ncomfortable to be generous. But, that might take a lot of years and  <br/>\nwon&#39;t happen all at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 17, 2009, at 9:51 AM, Adrean Clark wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He was VERY upset, to say the least.

My son really wants a Wii but has a<br/>\ntendency to be aggressive about his things.  He tends to take over his<br/>\nyounger brothers&#39; things and has issues with sharing time on his games.  We<br/>\nalso have two computers, one is his own laptop.  I try to manage time the<br/>\nbest I can between them, and try to remind them to ask each other about<br/>\nusing their things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked for a Wii recently and we talked it over for several months, both<br/>\nof us saving up money for it.  But I grew more concerned about his<br/>\nunwillingness to share with his brothers -- and I knew I could not commit to<br/>\npolicing Wii usage for several weeks.  Nor could I bear the inevitable<br/>\nexplosions when he has to turn over time to his younger brothers (as they<br/>\nwere saving up for it too in a combined purchase).  My husband could not<br/>\neither (he&#39;s deafblind and unable to catch what&#39;s going on on-screen.<br/>\nPrefers not to have anything to do with it, which leaves it up to me :/) So<br/>\nwe talked about it and I said I supported his desire for a Wii and think<br/>\nit&#39;s totally awesome but I could not give the energy needed for it to come<br/>\ninto our household.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was VERY upset, to say the least.  Instead of getting the Wii we went to<br/>\nthe game store and bought a lot of older GameCube games and some DS games.<br/>\nWe were able to get a lot of things for the same price as the Wii and one<br/>\ngame, but I wonder if I was shortchanging him?  Were we diverging from the<br/>\nideal of unschooling here?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note:  There is a big difference between my older and younger<br/>\nchildren.  My son went through school up til partway of 2nd grade and the<br/>\ntwins only had one semester of preschool.  They also have each other while<br/>\nmy oldest is a bit alone.  I think he feels powerless at times because of<br/>\nhis experience (and our authoritarian days *sigh*) and does things to regain<br/>\nhis feeling of power. It&#39;s not always healthy and I really want to find ways<br/>\nto help him be healthy.
