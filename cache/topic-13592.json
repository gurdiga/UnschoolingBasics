My oldest has only been with us <br/>\nweekends and holidays due to a shared custody arrangement so I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t had the same type of fighting issues with her that I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nin my younger two children.  My younger 2 are only 20 months apart <br/>\nand are each other&#39;s main playmates.  My ds9 is an introvert who <br/>\nlikes being alone a lot of time.  My dd8 is an extrovert who likes <br/>\nbeing with people nearly all of the time.  Their personalities have <br/>\nmade for some interesting clashes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not like the parenting theory that allows children to continue <br/>\nfighting to work it out themselves.  If they had the ability to work <br/>\nit out, they wouldn&#39;t be fighting.  I don&#39;t think they necessarily <br/>\nhave the experience and tools to find a peaceful resolution without <br/>\nany outside assistance.  Now, sometimes they do work it out.  I&#39;m <br/>\nalso sure they have more disagreements than I see.  I step in when I <br/>\nsee their spirits breaking.  Even my DH and I have disagreements, <br/>\nbut when one of us is really hurting, we can sort of put the <br/>\ndisagreement to the side and reconnect emotionally because our love <br/>\nis greater than our hurts.  But my kids don&#39;t have that feeling.  <br/>\nSometimes their fighting sparks the &#39;fight or flight&#39; mode and it&#39;s <br/>\njust way intense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also step in when I hear them doing what I call typical kid <br/>\ndisagreeing.  You know, the &#39;yes, no, yes, no, yes, no&#39; back and <br/>\nforth type stuff that leads absolutely no where.  I always ask them <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on and give them both a chance to tell me what&#39;s going <br/>\non but instead of trying &quot;fix&quot; it, I usually hug, kiss and validate <br/>\nand try to let them see the other&#39;s point of view.  Then I redirect <br/>\nto something entirely different.  It seems much easier to send the <br/>\nkids away, i.e. out of the room or out of the house, for peace and <br/>\nquiet.  But part of our unschooling lifestyle is that I am a 100% <br/>\nparticipant in their lives.  It means I might have to stop what I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing, put my laptop down, put my book down, stop cleaning, get off <br/>\nthe phone, etc.; but in those times especially, they need me there <br/>\nwith them.  We find something fun to do and our spirits become <br/>\njoyful again.  Most always, they graduate into doing something <br/>\ntogether and leave me out of the loop so that I find something to do <br/>\nwith myself.  Our days ebb and flow like this all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Letting Go and Fightings Siblings","postDate":"1148515661","msgId":13612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVYxOEE2OTM0OTE5MEM3MEYxMzM0NUY1RDM5OTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PEE3QzJBMzFBLTZFNjctNEYxQS1CNDVELTk0NUM1MEY1QUM2REBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":13604,"nextInTopic":13626,"prevInTime":13611,"nextInTime":13613,"topicId":13592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam s is a great response.... my sister and I are only 22 months apart and\nbecause of birthdays, were only  a year apart in school... growing up we\nwere the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-246921857\">Pam&#39;s is a great response.... my sister and I are only 22 months apart and<br/>\nbecause of birthdays, were only  a year apart in school... growing up we<br/>\nwere the best of friends and the worst of enemies.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nmy mom very rarely butted in to our arguments... most of the time she&#39;d just<br/>\nyell from the other room &quot;girls, quit your bickering!&quot;  when we were very<br/>\nyoung, our parents would always make us &quot;kiss and make up&quot;... they&#39;d always<br/>\ntell us &quot;don&#39;t go away mad, just go away&quot;... not always the best way to<br/>\nhandle things but certainly not the worst, I figured they did the best with<br/>\nwhat they knew, since they both grew up with many siblings.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI can tell you that I remember the last fight my sister and I got into...

And, at 15, 18, and  <br/>\n21, they still like each other and still WANT to hang out together -  <br/>\nthey&#39;re proud of each other, BUT they still, in fact, have conflicts  <br/>\nand sometimes say things to each other that hurt MY feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Letting Go and Fightings Siblings","postDate":"1148476116","msgId":13592,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNC4zMGM3NzllLjMxYTViNGQ0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13604,"prevInTime":13591,"nextInTime":13593,"topicId":13592,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/24/2006 7:52:56 AM Eastern Standard Time, fetteroll@earthlink.net writes: It *isn t* easy to let go!

It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>\nself examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>\nlist is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just <br/>\nnot seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very scary.  For me, making the decisions to &quot;try&quot; changes and for my <br/>\nhusband, watching us change.  He asks me every few days if I&#39;m afraid, scared, <br/>\netc.  He is more scared than we are because he&#39;s not on these support lists.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI admittedly have more than a dozen balloons still controlling our lives and <br/>\nwe are popping them one, sometimes two at a time.  What I&#39;ve learned as I <br/>\nreally allow ourselves to be free is that it is working for our family.  Really <br/>\nworking.  My kids are happier, I&#39;m happier, we&#39;re building trust (I didn&#39;t <br/>\nrealize I wasn&#39;t trusting them until I let go of the reigns), they&#39;re learning to <br/>\ntrust themselves, they&#39;re thinking more because they&#39;re thinking about what <br/>\nthey want to think and not what I was forcing them to try to think about.  Does <br/>\nthat make any sense?  It&#39;s not easy, but its getting easier as we learn to <br/>\ntrust ourselves and each other.  As time goes on I think the rest of our balloons <br/>\nwill probably set themselves free and we may not even see them go because this <br/>\nfreedom thing is becoming so natural.  I am also learning how to respect my <br/>\nown issues without imposing them onto my children.  Cleaning for example, my <br/>\nbiggest issue.  I&#39;m dealing with messes and not yelling and feeling frustrated <br/>\nabout it.  Most of the time.  I really like the thought of cleaning as a <br/>\nchoice.  It is a choice.  I am going to choose not to clean today--Thank you Joyce!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my question for the day:  How do you seasoned unschoolers handle <br/>\nsibling rivalry, your kids fighting, irritating each other, etc?  I&#39;ve come to an <br/>\nunhappy place in this area where I just don&#39;t want to hear my kids mistreating <br/>\neach other so I frequently tell them to go fight away from me.  That is really <br/>\nnot what I want I just want them to quit bickering.  It hurts me to hear them <br/>\nhurt each other.  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin, feeling like I&#39;m in therapy when I read these helpful posts.  Thanks <br/>\nfor all the tangible advice and help ladies!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13642,"nextTopicId":13600}}
