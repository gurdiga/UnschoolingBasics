With a magazine there&#39;s the *expectation* that you *won&#39;t* get every opinion out there. That you *will* get what the editors believe is worthwhile. And if you want a different take on the subject you know there&#39;s hundreds of other sources where you can easily find them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list isn&#39;t a magazine. There are important differences, but there is the aspect of keeping the ideas focused on what supports human relationships and learning. There&#39;s the aspect of *using* that focus to filter out the ideas the &quot;editors&quot; believe won&#39;t. Not everyone will filter with the same criteria the long time posters use. BUT NO ONE IS LIMITED TO THIS FORUM BY SIGNING ON.

If you don&#39;t, find something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the foundation of unschooling! It&#39;s how humans learn. It&#39;s how kids learn and what parents should be supporting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the big problems with trying to explain this list is that most people didn&#39;t know this is what they wanted until they try it. There&#39;s nothing people are familiar with that will help them get what this list is before they try it. It&#39;s not a class. It&#39;s not a magazine. But it shares more with them than it does a support group.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; warn prospective new members about your censorship <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The above is a *profound* misuse of the word censorship. It&#39;s dismissive of the people in this world who truly are censored, who can&#39;t get their words out so others can hear or read them.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo where in the world can anyone say anything they want anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US everyone is free to create their own forum and put their words out for others to read. Yahoo. Facebook. Blogger. Twitter. Tumblr. You can print pamphlets and hand them out. And loads of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have ideas you believe are important for people to know that don&#39;t get through to the list, make your own forum. Invite people to read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not true in many countries. If someone&#39;s words can&#39;t appear in one place they *can&#39;t* go somewhere else. They are censored by the government.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you&#39;re calling censorship is filtering. Filtering helps keep information focused. It&#39;s a *service* to people. As with a magazine, you find someone whose voice you like. If you don&#39;t like their voice, you find someone else.

People can use one, two, a handful of unschooling ideas. But thats not unschooling. It&#39;s using a handful of unschooling ideas! It&#39;s using them all together as a package that makes it unschooling. Just as eating more vegetables isn&#39;t vegetarianism. Though someone who wants to eat more vegetables could certainly draw on the ideas in a vegetarian forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough your expectations are a really good jumping off point to discuss thoughts on learning something new!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone picks up an introductory book, goes to an introductory class, that person expects it will start with the simplest, basic ideas and build from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat approach makes it easy to pour in a chunk of knowledge.
