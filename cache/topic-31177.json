If you re interested or you know of someone","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-545586173\">Hiya, Folks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLarry Gauchman, Lisa Heyman&#39;s husband, has asked me to help him find <br/>\nhelp for managing his household.  If you&#39;re interested or you know of <br/>\nsomeone who might be, please call me.  My number is below.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what it would involve:<br/>\n<br/>\nHours:   The hours would be approximately 30 hours per week, <br/>\napproximately 8 am - 4pm on four out of five weekdays.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiving Situation:  Larry would prefer someone who lives separately, <br/>\nbut he and the girls are willing to consider someone to live-in.  In <br/>\nthis case, that person would have their own bedroom and use a shared bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Requirements:  A clean driving record is required.  The <br/>\nindividual must be proficient in English.  This individual must <br/>\nappreciate children and teenagers and be willing to interact with <br/>\nthem.   A person who understands unschooling-lifestyle concepts would <br/>\nbe a real plus!  At the very least, this individual should be a <br/>\nflexible person who is respectful of an alternative lifestyle and can <br/>\nhonor alternative dietary choices, as well.  Ideally, this situation <br/>\nwould be perfect for a young, single adult (a grown unschooler perhaps?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe individual needs to be a non-smoker.<br/>\n<br/>\nResponsibilities would include overall household management: e.g., <br/>\nmeal preparation, house cleaning, laundry, transporting two children <br/>\nto various activities during the day, grocery shopping, running errands, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerks:   Their home is situated in a vibrant community within walking <br/>\ndistance of a large lake with a sand beach where swimming is <br/>\navailable all summer.  Also, there is a fairly close train (not <br/>\nwithin walking distance) that goes right into Grand Central Station <br/>\nin NYC (about a one-hour trip).<br/>\n<br/>\nLocation:  Putnam County, New York (a beautiful spot in the Hudson <br/>\nValley on the eastern side of the Hudson River close to Bear <br/>\nMountain, New York).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re interested or you know someone who is, please call Marji <br/>\n(that&#39;s me) at 845 . 651 . 2817.  If I&#39;m not there, just leave me a <br/>\nmessage and I&#39;ll call you back.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you think might <br/>\nbe interested, and feel free also to cross-post this message to other lists.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\nmarji AT gaiawolf DOT org<br/>\n845 ~ 651 ~ 2817<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31161,"nextTopicId":31180}}
