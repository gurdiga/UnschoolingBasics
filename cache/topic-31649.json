He did check out the<br/>\nvideo game room & played<br/>\na bit of the Mario game on gamecube.  And did connect with someone - but<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know his name &lt;g&gt;,<br/>\nand he never saw him again that weekend.    He was intimidated by the Halo<br/>\nplayers and so didn&#39;t play that, which is<br/>\nhis favorite game of alltime.  In hindsight, I should have stayed there with<br/>\nhim & got him included in a game, but<br/>\nhe said he didn&#39;t want me to do that.  He stayed in his room & watched a lot<br/>\nof tv & played his ds.<br/>\nHe did get out and swim with his dad.  And he did go to the water games<br/>\nsession &lt;fun!&gt;, but that was<br/>\n just with his little sister and her new friend, Asher.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;d enjoy it more now because he&#39;s &quot;met&quot; some unschoolers on the<br/>\nunschool gamers forum that<br/>\nhe plays with on Xbox Live.  If they were at the conference, he&#39;d go already<br/>\nhaving friends...<br/>\n<br/>\nheather<br/>\n Quentin, 12 & Sierra, 9<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Apr 6, 2008 at 2:40 PM, rpindc04 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:robbin_mp@...\">robbin_mp@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m wondering how this conference would be for our son, 10 years old.<br/>\n&gt; We started hs-ing and unschooling last Fall, and are still<br/>\n&gt; deschooling to some extent.
