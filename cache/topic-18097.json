She has a wide variety of friends, whom all have different interests.  She also was reading at age two.  No one &#39;taught&#39; her.  That&#39;s just the way she is.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son?  He also has a very high IQ.  There&#39;s no teaching him as he just gets it.  We unschool.  I tried homeschool but it seemed silly as he already knows the things he would be covering in his age defined class level.  I started out this year opening the Language Arts book to learn that he had already figured out the rules from his extensive reading.  He just hadn&#39;t seen the rules written out.  So I joined this group to get insight.  (Very good advice on these pages!)<br/>\n <br/>\nGuess I believe, in the description of unschooling from birth as it fits the way I raised my kids.  I see the benefit of involved parents whether they chose school or unschool.  I was never the drop the kid off parent.  I was the one who pulled my kid out after one day of observing poor teaching and moved twenty miles so my daughter would be in an excellent class with an excellent teacher. (I was divorced and worked full-time and had never heard of homeschooling)<br/>\nTo me, my job (as teacher) was to nurture the love of learning.<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m still laughing that I, who was raised to see everything in black and white have learned to see gray areas.  = )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:fetteroll@...\">fetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, October 12, 2006 6:37:44 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] feeling anxious<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 11, 2006, at 4:54 PM, Maisha Khalfani wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And then I went to the library and checked out two books: <br/>\n&gt; Comprehensive Curriculum for 2nd grade and the one for 3rd grade. <br/>\n&gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any <br/>\n&gt; of this stuff!

And they they&#39;re free to forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids are rambling over the country-side, following one <br/>\ninteresting thing to another.

(Again, whether they actually learn for all time isn&#39;t the <br/>\ngoal. It&#39;s *hoped* the kids do, but schools can only guarantee that <br/>\nthe information went in long enough for the test.) It&#39;s following <br/>\nrecipes exactly as they&#39;re printed. It&#39;s pushing information into <br/>\nkids that they (supposedly) could draw on if they ever wanted to cook <br/>\nfor real.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is messing around in the kitchen, sometimes following <br/>\nrecipes, often making changes and additions and combining recipes, <br/>\nexperimenting from scratch. It&#39;s learning how ingredients combine and <br/>\nwork together and what equipment can do. It&#39;s real cooking and <br/>\nlearning more about it and getting better at it as you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is memorizing vocabulary and grammar of a foreign language you <br/>\nnever hear spoken and will never speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is immersing in English and picking it up as a side <br/>\neffect because it&#39;s a useful tool for getting what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any <br/>\n&gt; of this stuff! Are they behind???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMost anyone can memorize stuff for a test. Most anyone can absorb <br/>\ninformation if they&#39;re sitting trapped in a room with it. Those <br/>\ncurriculums aren&#39;t a list of what kids learn; It&#39;s raw information <br/>\nthe kids are exposed to. It doesn&#39;t connect to anything. It isn&#39;t <br/>\nmeaningful to the kids. It&#39;s just information that the schools get in <br/>\nand hope that it sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do they truly comprehend what to do with it? Do they understand <br/>\nit? Do they have good feelings associated with it or would they <br/>\nrather they never saw it again outside of a classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nMemorizing the times table isn&#39;t understanding what multiplication <br/>\nis. I&#39;d guess that most kids don&#39;t understand multiplication! Most <br/>\njust kick into automatic mode when they see two numbers between a <br/>\ntimes sign.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids learn things because they&#39;re already using them and <br/>\nthey want to know how to do it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many kids hate Shakespeare because of what they experienced in <br/>\nschool? They may &quot;know&quot; Shakespeare but what good is any information <br/>\nin their heads about him or his plays when it is so strongly <br/>\nassociated with &quot;Yuck!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids get to experience Shakespeare in fun ways: jokes, <br/>\ntake offs of bits of his plays, funny images, comedies where the goal <br/>\nof understanding what&#39;s going on is to get the jokes. And then if <br/>\nthey want more, they have a bag full of feel-good stuff about him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for everything kids &quot;learn&quot; in school. What good is all <br/>\nthat information: math and science and writing and English if it&#39;s so <br/>\ndull and irrelevant that kids want to avoid it as much as possible?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just skip the bad taste and learn about the things you&#39;re <br/>\nactually using and enjoying?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":58929735,"authorName":"Schafer Vanessa","from":"Schafer Vanessa &lt;psychomom95@...&gt;","profile":"psychomom95","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] feeling anxious","postDate":"1160688265","msgId":18137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDEyMjEyNDI1LjcxMzcxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjYwODEzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMTIxMjI2djE5Y2JiNmRjdGU4NmM5M2Q5MjcwNjdlMmVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18136,"nextInTopic":18139,"prevInTime":18136,"nextInTime":18138,"topicId":18097,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We ve only been unschooling since September, so I do know that we are at the beginning of deschooling.

They all have to stay together. They  <br/>\nall have to do the stops in the order the train goes through them.  <br/>\nWhether they actually understand the stuff is irrelevant. All they  <br/>\nneed to do is demonstrate they&#39;ve retained it long enough to pass a  <br/>\ntest. And they they&#39;re free to forget.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids are rambling over the country-side, following one  <br/>\ninteresting thing to another. (The analogy breaks down there since  <br/>\nthey can be following and making connections along many paths  <br/>\nsimultaneously.) They learn because it&#39;s interesting or meaningful to  <br/>\nthem right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that testing and checking curriculum does is show which of the  <br/>\ntrain stops your kids happened to have explored. What they don&#39;t show  <br/>\nis what your kids have explored and learned about *instead*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is studying kitchen science. It&#39;s goal is identifying and  <br/>\nlearning the properties of each ingredient. It&#39;s learning what pots  <br/>\nare for. (Again, whether they actually learn for all time isn&#39;t the  <br/>\ngoal. It&#39;s *hoped* the kids do, but schools can only guarantee that  <br/>\nthe information went in long enough for the test.) It&#39;s following  <br/>\nrecipes exactly as they&#39;re printed. It&#39;s pushing information into  <br/>\nkids that they (supposedly) could draw on if they ever wanted to cook  <br/>\nfor real.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is messing around in the kitchen, sometimes following  <br/>\nrecipes, often making changes and additions and combining recipes,  <br/>\nexperimenting from scratch. It&#39;s learning how ingredients combine and  <br/>\nwork together and what equipment can do. It&#39;s real cooking and  <br/>\nlearning more about it and getting better at it as you go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is memorizing vocabulary and grammar of a foreign language you  <br/>\nnever hear spoken and will never speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is immersing in English and picking it up as a side  <br/>\neffect because it&#39;s a useful tool for getting what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I flipped through them and thought &quot;I don&#39;t think my kids know any  <br/>\n&gt; of this stuff!

Those  <br/>\ncurriculums aren&#39;t a list of what kids learn; It&#39;s raw information  <br/>\nthe kids are exposed to. It doesn&#39;t connect to anything. It isn&#39;t  <br/>\nmeaningful to the kids. It&#39;s just information that the schools get in  <br/>\nand hope that it sticks.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do they truly comprehend what to do with it? Do they understand  <br/>\nit? Do they have good feelings associated with it or would they  <br/>\nrather they never saw it again outside of a classroom?<br/>\n<br/>\nMemorizing the times table isn&#39;t understanding what multiplication  <br/>\nis. I&#39;d guess that most kids don&#39;t understand multiplication! Most  <br/>\njust kick into automatic mode when they see two numbers between a  <br/>\ntimes sign.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids learn things because they&#39;re already using them and  <br/>\nthey want to know how to do it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many kids hate Shakespeare because of what they experienced in  <br/>\nschool? They may &quot;know&quot; Shakespeare but what good is any information  <br/>\nin their heads about him or his plays when it is so strongly  <br/>\nassociated with &quot;Yuck!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids get to experience Shakespeare in fun ways: jokes,  <br/>\ntake offs of bits of his plays, funny images, comedies where the goal  <br/>\nof understanding what&#39;s going on is to get the jokes. And then if  <br/>\nthey want more, they have a bag full of feel-good stuff about him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for everything kids &quot;learn&quot; in school.

Don&#39;t compare your small people to other small people -- not even to each other.  Each has their own path.  Whenever you compare, you measure.  Someone always looks better and someone always looks worse.  Neither of those labels are useful.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  2.  The root of the word education is Latin for &quot;to draw out&quot;.  Mainstream K-12 &quot;education&quot; is a farce.  It&#39;s a creation of a bunch of folks who hold value in knowning this or that.  I was amazing at algebra in high school!!  Never used it since.  Value?  Not for me.  To me, the real value in unschooling is that each of our small people chooses what they need to know.  A true education, as the root of the word suggests.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  3.  Unschooling is about life.  Whole life.  My children can change a washer in a faucet.  That&#39;s not taught in school, but does, in fact, have value.  They are able to negotiate through disagreements most of the time.  A lifetime skill that not many have -- even as adults.  They have some knowledge of the limits of their bodies (when do they need to go to sleep, what happens when they get tired, what happens when you eat too many xyz&#39;s, etc.).  I don&#39;t know any schooled child (and many schooled at home as well!!) who have that self-knowledge.  That&#39;s certainly useful, but not found in any curriculum that I know of!!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  You&#39;re certainly not silly for feeling this way.  Every so often it happens to me too (and I will then pull out this message and read it to myself!!).  What you&#39;re doing is making a huge difference in their lives as a whole.

You don&#39;t need <br/>\ntesting and benchmarks.  They will be prepared for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, kids are born equipped for living and learning.  Live <br/>\nand learn with them.  Follow their lead.  Quit listening to those <br/>\naround you that insist on telling you the what&#39;s and why&#39;s of what <br/>\nthey think you are doing wrong.  They have no idea what they are <br/>\ntalking about.  Despite their so-called education, they are <br/>\nuneducated on anything to do with the philosophy of unschooling and <br/>\nthe blessing found in truly living.<br/>\n<br/>\nReturn the books to the library.  Never check them out again.  <br/>\nEveryone is different, so they make no real sense.  Bookmark the <br/>\nblogs of experienced unschoolers.  Read &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook&quot;.  Yes, I know your children are young, but this is SO <br/>\nappropriate.  It will build your confidence and broaden your <br/>\nhorizons.  Not to mention provide you with numerous cool resources.  <br/>\nBe sure to get the updated version.  It is the one with the colorful <br/>\ncover.  Check out &quot;The unschooling handbook : how to use the whole <br/>\nworld as your child&#39;s classroom&quot; by Mary Griffith.  This is perfect <br/>\nfor your age group and provides many ideas to get you started.  Read <br/>\nhere as often as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbove all, TRUST YOUR CHILDREN.  They are doing what they need to do <br/>\nright now.  It&#39;s okay.  One cannot possibly live without learning.  <br/>\nTry to deschool yourself.  Once you see living as learning you will <br/>\nquit trying to compartmentalise your activities and learn to see the <br/>\nvalue in everything.  You will quit comparing learning levels and <br/>\nlearn that everyone learns what they need to when they need it.  You <br/>\nwill quit seeing testing as an accurate measure of knowledge (it SO <br/>\nisn&#39;t).  You will quit worrying about everything and find new <br/>\nadventures around every corner.  You will start enjoying life.  You <br/>\nwill recapture your passions and find new ones.  You will make <br/>\nfriends that encourage you and build you up.  You will live and <br/>\nlearn WITH your children.  Being fully involved and active in each <br/>\nother&#39;s passions is the ultimate in living and SO worth pursuing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax, focus on yourself and have fun...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":61290046,"authorName":"Maisha Khalfani","from":"Maisha Khalfani &lt;maitai373@...&gt;","profile":"maitai373","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"feeling anxious","postDate":"1160600093","msgId":18097,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDExMjA1NDUzLjkxMjc5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMjE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18102,"prevInTime":18096,"nextInTime":18098,"topicId":18097,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First, let me say hi .
