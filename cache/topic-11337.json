My son has ADHD","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1094531753\">Hi - My name is Ellen and I am hoping to homeschool my son (8) next <br/>\nyear (4th grade).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are having some serious issues with the public school. My son has <br/>\nADHD & I don&#39;t feel they are capable of handling him properly. We&#39;ve <br/>\ntried their 504 program & behavior modification programs & reward <br/>\nprograms & counsellors, etc and it just isn&#39;t working because he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t fit into their type of schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have requested the Home Study Packet from my state (Vermont) and I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to try unschooling him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone give me an overview or a where to start type of thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you<br/>\nEllen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11325,"nextTopicId":11367}}
