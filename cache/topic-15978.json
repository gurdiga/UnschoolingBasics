The town has never given me any problems about <br/>\nhomeschooling, but I am concerned that they may notice (and <br/>\nquestion) the dramatic change in the way we are homeschooling now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone that lives in massachusetts please share some ways that <br/>\nthey have worded their letters of intent so as not to cause havoc <br/>\nwith the schools.  Massachusetts is a highly regulated state and I <br/>\nreally do not want to start a major war with the superintendant of <br/>\nschools here.  On the other hand, I don&#39;t want to outright lie and <br/>\ngive a listing of curriculum that I have no intention of actually <br/>\nusing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other snafu is that MA requires that you list a method of <br/>\nassessment in your letter of intent.  In past years, I have stated <br/>\nthat a portfolio of work samples OR standardized test scores would <br/>\nbe submitted IF (and only IF) they ask for them.  (They have yet to <br/>\nask me for either.)  What can I list as a method for this year, <br/>\nsince my kids will no longer be taking the standardized tests and <br/>\ntend to produce very little in the way of a paper trail that I could <br/>\nput together as a portfolio of work samples.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny  MA  residents who can help me out would be a great help. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nJanice W.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16002,"nextTopicId":16004}}
