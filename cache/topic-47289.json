When my daughter was nine months I began working again, two mornings a week.  We would refer to the hand-off as &quot;the baby toss&quot; as I came home from working and my husband rushed out the door.  As she got older and weaned and able to be away from one of us for longer, we switched to alternate days working, my husband Mon-Wed-Fri, myself Tues-Thurs.  For my daughter, her world has been mommy day-daddy day-mommy day-daddy day-mommy day for as long as she can remember.  She will be 13 next month.  About a two years ago we switched and now I work about 3 days and my husband 2 days.  As our daughter has gotten older, she does not need as much hands-on attention, so my husband usually fits in some work at home when it is daddy-day.  Also, we both tend to do email and other work-related tasks when we are waiting for her during classes, rehearsals, performances and such.  Since my husband and I have different interests, we have usually done different activities with her on our days.  I tend to book more scheduled activities, my husband likes more free form days so each of us (along with our daughter&#39;s strong input!) decides how we spend our days together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe both know we could be making more money if we worked more, but we also know that these years are precious and we are committed to a family-centric, time-rich life.  When we are clear about what is most important to us, we get creative and life aligns and it is easier to say no to that which does not support us.  Somehow, it has always worked out, sometimes with more money flowing through, sometimes with less.  Regularly my husband and I will say to each other &quot;we are wealthy beyond measure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n~ Colleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: logistics and livelihoods","postDate":"1316268511","msgId":47290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo1MjlrditwZTVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRFNzQ4Q0IzLjcwODA2MDdAYWt0aXZpeC5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":47289,"nextInTopic":47291,"prevInTime":47289,"nextInTime":47291,"topicId":47289,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s not necessary for Both parents to be home to unschool successfully - and most families can&#39;t afford that. It&#39;s pretty common for one parent to work full time and not uncommon for the other to work at least part-time as well. There are even single parents who manage to unschool successfully!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest keys to unschooling with a lower income are flexibility and creativity. You&#39;ve already found one way to work from home and there may be others for you or your partner. It&#39;s also helpful to look for jobs with something other than &quot;bankers hours&quot;. That could be anything from a job where you work 24hr shifts to something that lets you work nights or work one week a month or six weeks of intensive work to support you for the next six months. It&#39;s all a matter of what&#39;s going to &quot;work&quot; for your family... and what&#39;s available of course. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to keep in mind that often there&#39;s not One solution but a set of options from which to create solutions in the moment - that&#39;s true in almost all aspects of unschooling actually. As your kids get older, their needs will change and your options will change, so what &quot;works&quot; now won&#39;t necessarily work in three years - but in three years your kids will be three years older and new options will have developed. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":483692407,"authorName":"nina","from":"nina &lt;nina@...&gt;","profile":"nimoe77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"logistics and livelihoods","postDate":"1316261043","msgId":47289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRFNzQ4Q0IzLjcwODA2MDdAYWt0aXZpeC5vcmc+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47290,"prevInTime":47288,"nextInTime":47290,"topicId":47289,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I am mother of an 8 months old, feeling our lives slide quite naturally into unschooling in terms of my and my partner s desires and convictions, but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-735456094\">Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am mother of an 8 months old, feeling our lives slide quite naturally<br/>\ninto unschooling in terms of my and my partner&#39;s desires and<br/>\nconvictions, but I&#39;m unsure about the logistics of survival in the world<br/>\nas is.
