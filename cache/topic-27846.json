It&#39;s all part of learning. I think parents need to GET really<br/>\ncomfortable in talking about sex if they want their children to be<br/>\nopen with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say much without permission from the child I&#39;d like to chat<br/>\nabout, but I can say that both my teens talk to me openly about an<br/>\nassortment of topics around sex. Trevor has attended Diana&#39;s talk and<br/>\nmost recently he and his girlfriend and younger brother were at a<br/>\ndiscussion hosted at a camp-out we attend with other home/unschooling<br/>\nfamilies and really enjoyed that.  They covered sex and a variety of<br/>\ninteresting topics. It was facilitated openly so everyone could share<br/>\ntheir opinions freely. I think those kind of discussions are so<br/>\nwonderful and one of the reasons we like to gather with other unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor (17) is dating someone who is bi-sexual and very involved in<br/>\ngay rights at her college campus. He&#39;s now gotten to attend some<br/>\nevents down there and watch a drag show. Having been on the edge of my<br/>\ncareer as a makeup artist has also helped him learn about a variety of<br/>\nissues and different segments of our society that people often don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand.<br/>\n <br/>\nSex has never been different than any other topic around here. The<br/>\nresult is children that ask me some pretty amazingly pointed questions<br/>\nand tell me a lot about their thoughts/desires etc...<br/>\nDo they tell me everything? I doubt it!!  They have a right to privacy<br/>\nand what they share is their business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love that we have open, non-judgemental adults in our lives that<br/>\nthey can trust if they want to talk with someone other than their<br/>\nparents.

Well, he&#39;s 13, so she&#39;s been<br/>\nwithholding information all this time because she was uncomfortable<br/>\ntalking about it.

Maybe she just<br/>\nprefers not to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nA better option than waiting to have a big talk is to have lots and<br/>\nlots of casual, everyday-type conversations about it the whole time<br/>\nthey are growing up. Start talking about it now, whenever it comes up<br/>\nor a kid expresses an interest, no matter what age they are. Keep the<br/>\nchannels of communication open. Be honest. Don&#39;t belittle or shy away<br/>\nfrom their interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend was telling me a story that involved a gay man and she<br/>\nlowered her voice to a whisper because dd (8) was nearby. But dd<br/>\nalready knows what gay means. My friend said, &quot;Oh, you talk with her<br/>\nabout that kind of thing?&quot; Well, yeah! Over the course of many, many<br/>\nconversations! Not a lot of info pouring in at once (unless that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat she needs) but lots and lots of little discusses with honest,<br/>\nstraightforward info and back-and-forth casual chatting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we were watching the tv show Friends. After a moment of<br/>\ndialog between the actors in which they discussed a romantic situation<br/>\nshe asked me, &quot;Mom, what does sexual mean?&quot; She knew it related to<br/>\nsex, but wasn&#39;t sure how. I&#39;m glad that she afraid to ask me or bring<br/>\nup the subject. The more we talk about it, the easier it becomes and<br/>\nthe less discomfort I feel in discussing it. It is such a natural<br/>\nthing, it&#39;s literally what makes life on our planet. So why treat it<br/>\nas this big secretive topic??<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of hers is not allowed to say the word sex at all (and<br/>\nrelated words like sexy are off limits, too). Apparently when she was<br/>\nsix she was fascinated with the subject and it freaked her parents<br/>\nout. They dealt with it by ignoring her interest and forbidding her<br/>\nfrom speaking about it. I wonder if she&#39;ll want to approach them with<br/>\nquestions later on when it really matters...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of dd favorite movies is Marie Antoinette, which features several<br/>\nscenes about how she couldn&#39;t get pregnant right away as expected<br/>\nbecause her husband wouldn&#39;t sleep with her. DD pointed out that women<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to have sex to have a baby, which she knew from many prior<br/>\nconversations (I think one started with her asking about how she could<br/>\nhave a baby if she didn&#39;t want to get married or if she fell in love<br/>\nwith a woman).
