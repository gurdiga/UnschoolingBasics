No one can do it for you. You are the <br/>\nONLY one with the power over yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need &quot;permission,&quot; I would be honored to give it to you: You <br/>\nhave my permission to let go of whatever is keeping from having a <br/>\njoyful life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *you* are the only one that can do the work. And first, you have to <br/>\ndecide that is the path you will take.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Think about your expectations as parents. Did you really expect a <br/>\nthree year old to pick up after himself? Did you really expect an eight <br/>\nyear old to *care*? Did you not expect to have to clean and cook and <br/>\ncare for others than yourself daily? &#39;Cause all that really comes with <br/>\nthe &quot;kid package.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWho did you expect would clean the house when you had kids? The magic <br/>\nhouse cleaning fairy? Did you really think the children would pick up <br/>\nafter themselves? Did you pick up after yourself? Did you never toss <br/>\nCheerios on the floor? Give me your mom&#39;s number, so&#39;s I can check! <br/>\n&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCheerios on the floor came with the package---it&#39;s part of the <br/>\nexpectation. Really. Kids are messy.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Be grateful. Grateful for *everything* you have---even if it&#39;s not <br/>\nmuch. It&#39;s probably a whole lot more than that of more than half the <br/>\nworld! If you&#39;re sitting in a warm house with computer access, you have <br/>\nmore than most. Hell, if you&#39;re whining about having to care for <br/>\nhealthy children, you have more than most! There&#39;s probably some secret <br/>\nlaw of physics that states those with the most whine the most! &lt;bwg&gt; We <br/>\nare SOOO lucky to have what we have! Most of us have washer/dryers--or <br/>\naccess to them instead of rocks and streams. Stoves and ovens instead <br/>\nof open fire pits. Multiple entertainment machines: radio, tv, <br/>\ncomputers, video games, iPods, whatever. We&#39;re lucky to have clothes to <br/>\nfold and dishes to wash and healthy, happy children snuggled up next to <br/>\nus. I have so many friends who *can&#39;t* have children or who have lost <br/>\nchildren---I feel especially lucky to have the two I do. Start and end <br/>\neach day with a feeling of gratitude---it&#39;ll show.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Realize that NOTHING is more important than the children. Dishes can <br/>\nwait. No matter how lucky I am to HAVE dishes and food on them, they&#39;ll <br/>\nstill be in the sink when I finish attending to the child. Laundry can <br/>\nwait. Dirty clothes can still be worn---some people wear the same <br/>\noutfit every day for years. And that pile will still be there after a <br/>\ngame of poker (they won&#39;t fold themselves, but they really don&#39;t have <br/>\nto be folded to be worn! &lt;g&gt;). Supper can be a PB&J---or McDonanld&#39;s <br/>\ntonight (well, except for Deb Lewis, who has never eaten there! &lt;G&gt;); <br/>\nno one will starve. No matter how many emails I have on my screen, they <br/>\nTOO will still be there when I get back! And some, I don&#39;t even have to <br/>\nanswer!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Say &quot;no&quot; more. Give yourself permission NOT to do things. Tell <br/>\nothers, &quot;no.&quot; (Tell your kids, &quot;yes.&quot; See #6) &quot;No, I can&#39;t bake cookies <br/>\nfor the church bake sale, I need to play with my kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Say &quot;yes&quot; more. Yes to your children, to yourself, and to your <br/>\nspouse. If your first response is no, rethink WHY you think that. There <br/>\n*might* be a way. Brainstorm possibilities---even if they won&#39;t work. <br/>\nYou never know! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Heal the child in *you* by being the parent you wish you had. <br/>\nBetter: be the parent your child would wish for. &lt;g&gt; But you can heal <br/>\nthe wounds inside you as you give your child the best parent you can <br/>\nbe. You&#39;ll be surprised how much this can help. If you were that child <br/>\nin front of you, what would *you* want your parent to do right now? By <br/>\ngiving our children the time and love ---and respect and trust and <br/>\ngenerosity and freedom--that we never had, we can heal ourselves and <br/>\nrevel in what we *can* give our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure others can add to the list, but that&#39;s a start! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
