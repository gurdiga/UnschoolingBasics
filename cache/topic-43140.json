Kids (or adults for that matter) develop interests, get all wrapped up in learning a whole bunch, and then often set things aside for awhile - a few weeks or a few years. Mo goes in and out of phases of being interested in reading, but even when she&#39;s interested she&#39;s not all that enthusiastic about it. I don&#39;t mean I&#39;m trying to make her read, I mean she reads for informational purposes, rather than pleasure. That&#39;s not all that uncommon, either, many kids don&#39;t read for pleasure until early adolescence and some people never do. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s something else to keep in mind where reading is concerned - most of us have been sold this big bill of goods saying people are somehow *supposed* to like reading, but there&#39;s no reason for that to be the case. Reading is a tool, a skill-set that kids can and do learn to use without it being more than that in the same way some people drive cars daily without that being something they really enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSix is young. Some kids learn to read before six naturally, but reading is complex - hard work for a little kid. There&#39;s no real reason for a six year old to *need* to read, no reason to go to all the trouble or do all that hard work unless she really wants to, for the sheer joy of the process itself. Enjoy reading to your little one as much as she wants you to! She&#39;ll grow up fast enough without pushing her to read more on her own than she&#39;s ready for. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Highschool- I keep hearing that kids will need credit courses in the highschool years I guess either to qualify for graduation or for college.... why is this, and how does this still fit for unschooling??<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent this is more of a question for people in your local area, since laws vary, but in general there are a range of options available to homeschoolers where the teen years are concerned, options that, from an unschooling point of view, are largely dependent on what your kids want. In my state (TN) we have the option of using an &quot;umbrella school&quot; to appease the legal educational requirements, and have found one that&#39;s very friendly to unschoolers. Ray has a &quot;school ID&quot; and will eventually have a diploma from The Farm without ever having to take school-room type classes. A friend of mine, alternately, has a son taking classes at a local Junior College - a common route for college-bound homeschoolers and one that changes the playing field dramatically as &quot;graduation&quot; becomes less of a concern than &quot;do my credits transfer?&quot; Other homeschoolers get into colleges with transcrips and portfolios. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a Lot of time! Please don&#39;t stress too much about college right now! There are more options available all the time for homeschoolers interested in higher education and you have more than a decade ahead of you with your little one. That&#39;s lots of time to do more research on the subject. Home and especially unschoolers have advantages over high-schooled kids where colleges are concerned  because they&#39;re interested and motivated - things that go a long way in the world outside of mandatory education. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333475996,"authorName":"kristi3003@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;kristi3003@...&quot; &lt;kristi3003@...&gt;","profile":"kristi3003@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"reading and highschool","postDate":"1265917898","msgId":43140,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsMW40YStkaW5tQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43143,"prevInTime":43139,"nextInTime":43141,"topicId":43140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Two different questions: I m new here, I have a 6 yr old, she Can read but doesnt like to or want to read yet, it s REALLY hard for me to step back and not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1807531379\">Two different questions:<br/>\nI&#39;m new here, I have a 6 yr old, she Can read but doesnt&#39; like to or want to read yet, it&#39;s REALLY hard for me to step back and not &quot;teach&quot;.....but I&#39;m getting better w/ that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHighschool- I keep hearing that kids will need credit courses in the highschool years I guess either to qualify for graduation or for college.... why is this, and how does this still fit for unschooling??</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43148,"nextTopicId":43188}}
