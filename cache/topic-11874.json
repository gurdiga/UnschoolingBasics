Absolutely every decision made there is a judgement call, nothing is black and white.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal life example:<br/>\n<br/>\nMom came to CPS attention for some unknown reason, probably drug use.  Mom entered a family shelter with her two year old. A man in the shelter was sexually abusing kids but hadn&#39;t been thrown out.  Mom would have needed to leave two year old at shelter with worker while she went to work.  Mom found other housing and moved herself and daughter to a safe place.  Mom called CPS and informed them.  CPS worker swarmed in and removed daughter to foster care for 4 months.  I was the foster mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you should live in fear of CPS; but to say that those opinions aren&#39;t enforceable is a vast overstatement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a comment about the lawyers that you are given pro-bono in CPS cases.  In the 14 foster kids I had, each with their own lawyer, I was NEVER contacted by the lawyer at all.  The lawyer never met the kids except in court, the lawyers never talked to schools or neighbors.  The enforce the very basic minimum rights of the kids.  I was even calling judges to complain that lawyers weren&#39;t doing right by the kids and just got kind of blank looks in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Friday, April 14, 2006 9:35 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] same sex sharing a room<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;He said there was no law but the<br/>\n&gt; department would certainly view it negatively if they were called in<br/>\n&gt; to check on the family for something.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   What&#39;s not to understand?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why you would let that influence anything you do.

Tons of people  I know <br/>\nhave their kids share rooms, not everyone lives in a huge house and only  has a <br/>\nkid or two!<br/>\nMy mom was asking me when I&#39;ll move the kids room and she said maybe a year  <br/>\nor 2, I was like, no I was thinking atleast not until he&#39;s 10 or so.  She  was <br/>\nshocked them because they &quot;need thier privacy&quot;.  Hmmm, just funny that  this <br/>\nwas being discussed here while I was also having the same  conversation!<br/>\nAmanda B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"same sex sharing a room","postDate":"1145025312","msgId":11876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxb2J2MCtuamNsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11874,"nextInTopic":11878,"prevInTime":11875,"nextInTime":11877,"topicId":11874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"He said there was no law but the department would certainly view it negatively if they were called in to check on the family for something.

Why anyone would<br/>\nlive in fear of CPS. Why something that is not enforceable, but only<br/>\nthe negative opinion of a few folks, would cause anyone to change what<br/>\nthey do.  Old prejudices die hard. But old prejudices are not law, nor<br/>\ncan they do a damn thing about it.<br/>\nBesides, how often do you think CPS is going to knock on your door?<br/>\nI&#39;ve had it happen and it was honestly NO big deal. Most of them<br/>\naren&#39;t out to get people. Just make sure children are safe. The rabid<br/>\nones are less common than you&#39;d think. And if you know your rights,<br/>\nknow the law and are a good parent, you really don&#39;t have anything to<br/>\nworry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"same sex sharing a room","postDate":"1145024889","msgId":11874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxb2JocCszb2NrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11876,"prevInTime":11873,"nextInTime":11875,"topicId":11874,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This all makes me glad that I have just boys,  thank goodness  this will never be an issue for me, but there will always be other  concerns It isn t an issue","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1109078086\">&quot;This all makes me glad that I have just boys,  thank goodness  this will<br/>\nnever be an issue for me, but there will always be other  concerns&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t an issue unless you decide to make it one!
