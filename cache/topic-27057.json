At some point she had missed 20 of 22<br/>\n&quot;allowable&quot; days and the school social worker and guidance counselor<br/>\ncalled me in for a meeting to discuss her &quot;excessive&quot; absences.    I<br/>\ntold them I was amazed at how quickly they could be available for a<br/>\nmeeting when the entire previous year when my child had  a horrible<br/>\nverbally/emotionally abusive teacher they didn&#39;t have time to discuss<br/>\nTHAT with me!    <br/>\nI basically told them that if they were willing to retain a kid making<br/>\nstraight A&#39;s even though she was missing lots of days then I would be<br/>\nhappy to question that decision with the superintendent of schools.  <br/>\nI always sent in a note and reminded them for the record that the<br/>\nmajority of the absences were from a horrible flu she caught from the<br/>\nPRINCIPAL of the school (our neighbor!)  where they were both at home<br/>\nand sick for 2 weeks then returned to school and relapsed and missed<br/>\nanother week, since we were neighbors he knew where she was and could<br/>\nattest to her illness.  We did take &quot;mental health&quot; days and I did<br/>\nwrite an excuse stating such.   We would take days to go to the NC<br/>\nState fair, museums and so forth.   Every single absence was excused<br/>\nfor either illness or educational opportunity so they really could<br/>\nonly whine so much about it.    <br/>\nI think the situation might have been different if she had missed lots<br/>\nof days and not been keeping up in her schoolwork...she care about the<br/>\nschoolwork she just didn&#39;t like to be AT SCHOOL.     <br/>\nIf I could give my kid back 2 years of her life that were miserable<br/>\nbecause her mother was an idiot that would sure be the two I would choose!<br/>\nLisa Blocker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Amanda,<br/>\n&gt; Ref: I am curious how this would work with truancy laws.

I took it <br/>\nto the attendence lady and she just informed me it was nothing but a form letter<br/>\nas long as I sent in notes.  Which I did, lol, some of them rather funny like,<br/>\nCaylee was absent today because we got stuck in a mudpuddle. (Really happened!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also didn&#39;t hesitate to go remove my daughter from school when her horse wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nget up.  I got her home ASAP,as she was the only one that horse would rise for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school system never did more then send me that form letter which I receive near <br/>\nevery year.  My daughter&#39;s grades were never an issue and her test scores were high<br/>\nso attendance just never seemed to matter.  Oh, at one point they asked for doctor&#39;s<br/>\nnotes no biggie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Florida System, what can I say?<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nTonight&#39;s top picks.

I unschool my girls who are 7 and nearly 4.  We are in the<br/>\nmidst of an interesting transition over the next couple months.  I have been<br/>\na SAHM for four years.  I will be done with school in December and am going<br/>\nback to work soon.  My dh has been in college PT for several years now and<br/>\nis now in college online finishing up.  When I go back to work, he will be<br/>\nhome with the girls until he graduates at which time we will evaluate then<br/>\nwhere we are going from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been aware of the unschooling type of homeschooling since shortly<br/>\nafter I decided to homeschool 3 years ago, but I wasn&#39;t ready, unfortunately<br/>\nfor my children. I actually sent my oldest to preschool.  She loved it so I<br/>\nsent her to Kindergarten.  She hated it so we pulled her out.  We tried some<br/>\nschool at home. She hated it.  Right now we have a good balance<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest is currently in preschool (it&#39;s fun).  Somedays she goes, some<br/>\ndays she doesn&#39;t.  Its up to her, but I know that at some point doesn&#39;t<br/>\ntruancy become an issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, I am not a radical unschooler YET.  I still have things that I<br/>\nneed to let go of, but I do my best and I am growing everyday toward that.<br/>\nI will probably mostly lurking on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRoger, Amanda, Marti and Lilly<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education&quot; -Mark Twain<br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 Price Slide shows make GREAT Christmas Presents!<br/>\nExample Slide shows at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/\">http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/</a><br/>\nSee my pictures at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.HopesCreations.com\">http://www.HopesCreations.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/\">http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27037,"nextTopicId":27027}}
