Most people leave school with such a narrow idea of <br/>\nwhat &quot;math&quot; is and *that* hampers their understanding. When I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen able to find ways to explain concepts that don&#39;t look or sound <br/>\nlike &quot;math&quot; I find many people have a deeper understanding than they <br/>\nthemselves realize - its not that they don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t <br/>\nknow, they don&#39;t know or value what they *do* know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the &quot;less smart&quot; feeling that some people have is a result <br/>\nof having developed anxiety about learning. In quilting workshops <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen (and experienced myself) the delight that comes over <br/>\npeople when they are learning something entirely new. The difference <br/>\nis that these are people who are choosing to do something for the <br/>\nenjoyment of it and learning as a result. That&#39;s a basic principle <br/>\nof unschooling - that natural learning is enjoyable. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m learning to juggle (just got some clubs, woooo hooo!). <br/>\nThere are definately times when I feel like I&#39;m all thumbs, or that <br/>\nI&#39;m making infintessimal progress. But I don&#39;t feel &quot;less smart&quot; for <br/>\nnot knowing how to juggle. I *do* get a sense of anxiety around <br/>\ncertain jugglers, who have a very didactic way of talking to me <br/>\nabout juggling. Other jugglers I know are simply supportive - <br/>\nthey&#39;ll offer help if I seem like I need it, applaud my sucesses and <br/>\ninvite me to laugh at my goofs. I don&#39;t have any anxiety at all <br/>\nabout juggling in front of them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that is why we often feel less smart as<br/>\n&gt; we get older :-) as we learn more about our own ignorance<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really glad you posted this, since its giving me a chance to <br/>\nexplore the idea. I think the folks I&#39;m describing as &quot;didactic&quot; are <br/>\nmaking a point of telling me how ignorant I am. Not in a mean way. I <br/>\ncan tell these guys - its just two - are trying to be helpful, even <br/>\nencouraging. But somehow it leads to me feeling worse about my <br/>\nability. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe jugglers I know who are being supportive, but not didactic, <br/>\naren&#39;t any less skilled jugglers than these two guys - if anything, <br/>\nthey&#39;re better. Watching them, I can *see* all the things I can&#39;t do <br/>\nyet, but I&#39;m left with a sense of &quot;hey, wow, can I do that, <br/>\nsomeday?&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m a long way from there&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;especially in math<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t find learning &quot;math&quot; necessarily different from learning <br/>\nother things - one of the reasons I brought up juggling, although <br/>\nits pretty easy to argue that juggling is math ;) Learning just <br/>\nisn&#39;t segmented into clear categories. Individual tendencies, <br/>\ndevelopment, past experiences, and the environment all interact and <br/>\noverlap and swirl around. Knowing what I know about my own patterns <br/>\nof learning is far more useful to *me* in getting over the first <br/>\nstage of learning *anything* than any other skill or piece of <br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4379372,"authorName":"Paul D.

It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,<br/>\nWindows and MacOS.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another free package discussed at the first link:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\">http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</a><br/>\n&quot;GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical<br/>\ncomputations. It provides a convenient command line interface for<br/>\nsolving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing<br/>\nother numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible<br/>\nwith Matlab.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another (simpler) free package for statistics and plotting:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.gnuplot.info/\">http://www.gnuplot.info/</a><br/>\n&quot;Gnuplot  is a portable command-line driven interactive data and<br/>\nfunction plotting utility for UNIX, IBM OS/2, MS Windows, DOS,<br/>\nMacintosh, VMS, Atari and many other platforms. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, to get a lot out of any of them, you have to put some time into<br/>\nthem and probably consult additional reference materials in their<br/>\ntutorial manuals, on the web, and/or in related textbooks. Also, these<br/>\ntools are all are a matter of convenience -- a general purpose<br/>\nprogramming tool with some good libraries (e.g. Python + SciPy)<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scipy.org/\">http://www.scipy.org/</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software\">http://www.scipy.org/Topical_Software</a><br/>\ncan let you do pretty much anything these specialized packages do and in<br/>\na much more expandable way -- it just takes *much* more time and<br/>\nunderstanding to work with the general tools (though you learn a lot<br/>\ndoing that). I&#39;d suggest perhaps doing both -- play with the tools *and*<br/>\ntry to learn how to program with various packages. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see from especially the third link above, there are several<br/>\nother tools. I&#39;m not sure how well all of these run under other<br/>\noperating systems (most probably do run under Windows, but my wife and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t use that ourselves anymore except under emulation on the Mac or<br/>\nLinux). You can probably find most of theses tools included (or easily<br/>\nloadable) in Ubuntu (a version of GNU/Linux), which is available for<br/>\nfree here (you can download and burn a bootable CD to run these when you<br/>\nwant by rebooting, even if you run Windows):<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a><br/>\nand they also mail out free CDs (but it may take some time -- see the<br/>\nlinks on that page). There is also an &quot;Edubuntu&quot; educational variant,<br/>\nbut it seems more targeted at schools and I haven&#39;t tried it.<br/>\nInstructions for loading some of these packages into Ubuntu:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&t=402802&highlight=Mathematical+software\">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=c8e173f81d97693ff7bb02ad5cefba0a&t=402802&highlight=Mathematical+software</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAny one of these packages is a project to get to know and understand. It<br/>\nmight takes quite a while to get a feel for them. But I think mastering<br/>\nany of these packages will have a lot of practical value -- more so than<br/>\ndoing some paper exercises.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile our child is only three (and so I haven&#39;t tried to use these<br/>\npackages to teach him math; I&#39;m still focusing on John Holt&#39;s ideas of<br/>\nseeing how small numbers like nine can be broken down and assembled many<br/>\nways), I have been involved tangentially with some people doing<br/>\nmathematical education using computer software for more advanced math,<br/>\nprimarily using the programming language Python.<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.python.org/\">http://www.python.org/</a><br/>\nThere is a newer way of thinking about math and physics which suggests<br/>\nthinking about that as just a subpart of computer programming, rather<br/>\nthan a more classical school subject approach which often puts computer<br/>\nprogramming as an add-on under math & physics. :-) Essentially, by<br/>\ndeveloping programs and simulations of interest to a child, a child<br/>\nlearns more and more about basic principles of mathematics they need to<br/>\nsolve problems of interest to them, as well as to develop a certain type<br/>\nof mathematical thinking skills related to precision and causality and<br/>\nsymbol manipulation and so on. Learning to program then becomes the<br/>\nstepping stone to learning about math and physics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a child can learn a lot about trigonometry by just playing<br/>\naround with a 2D or 3D turtle:<br/>\n  &quot;turtle -- Turtle graphics for Tk using Python&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html\">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-turtle.html</a><br/>\nHowever they typically need to learn a little programming first (like<br/>\nhow to write a loop). Consider, for example, this college assignment:<br/>\n  &quot;Mandelbrot, Turtle Graphics and L-Systems in Python&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html\">http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp144-s02/assignments/2/index.html</a><br/>\nI would think those sorts of experiments could keep a high schooler busy<br/>\nfor quite a while, while also learning about angles and distances and<br/>\nmathematical reasoning (while they debug their graphical programs); but<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t try those as a first step for someone who did not already<br/>\nknow programming. Here is a simple code snippet for someone wanting to<br/>\nlearn some simple programming and turtle graphics with Python:<br/>\n  &quot;Turtle Graphics (Python)&quot;<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html\">http://www.daniweb.com/code/snippet304.html</a><br/>\nModify that to draw a few geometric shapes (cubes, octagons,<br/>\nparallelograms, etc.) and it&#39;s a start down the path of 2D geometry. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a bigger set of links (mostly programs) related to<br/>\nPython+Geometry for homeschoolers<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html\">http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html</a><br/>\nIn general the author of that site has a lot to say about the<br/>\nintersection of computing and mathematics.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get more advanced in 3D geometry, here is a free package by the late<br/>\nArthur Siegel to do interactive 3D geometry in Python:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/\">http://pygeo.sourceforge.net/</a><br/>\n&quot;PyGeo is most fundamentally a framework for the creation of dynamic<br/>\ngeometric constructions - i.e. constructions which embody defined and<br/>\npersistent geometric relationships responsive to real time on-screen<br/>\ninteractivity. PyGeo is, further, an implementation of this underlying<br/>\nabstract framework - exposing a range of geometric objects as the<br/>\nbuilding blocks for virtual, dynamic geometric constructions. The focus<br/>\nis away from Euclidian geometry and metrics, and toward later geometric<br/>\nand mathematical developments - particularly those connected with<br/>\nprojective geometry of real space, and the geometry of complex numbers<br/>\non the plane and on the unit (Riemann) sphere.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing about school-style trigonometry &quot;proofs&quot; there though -- except<br/>\nthe ones you build for yourself in passing to debug things. Here&#39;s lots<br/>\nof links related to logic software and logic education if you want to<br/>\nfocus on proofs (includes some links to theorem provers):<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html\">http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/hans/logiccourseware.html</a><br/>\nBut I would think this a dustier and drier route for most kids to get an<br/>\nintuition for geometrical things than indirectly via programming.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome fraction of the population has trouble visualizing or<br/>\nrotating things in 2D or 3D,<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_Visualization_Ability</a><br/>\nso some kids find geometry much easier than others. I think 3D spatial<br/>\nvisualization tools may help narrow that gap, especially tools which can<br/>\nmake the 3d object rotate (at least slightly).

Example:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html\">http://www.ms.uky.edu/~lee/visual05/visual05.html</a><br/>\nIf there is one issue that may make or break in some advanced math<br/>\nstudies, it is an ability to visualize. If the kid in question isn&#39;t<br/>\ngood at that, it may help more to focus early on visualization skills<br/>\n(including blueprint reading) than to move ahead to more advanced topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another programming language system Squeak (Smalltalk) which has<br/>\nvarious educational tools in it like turtles:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.squeak.org/Features/\">http://www.squeak.org/Features/</a><br/>\nIt has a steeper learning curve than Python though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own life I&#39;ve found the only major use for trigonometry was<br/>\nwriting 3D graphics software. :-) Here is a example of such software<br/>\n(available for free) which my wife and I wrote:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm\">http://www.kurtz-fernhout.com/PlantStudio/index.htm</a><br/>\n&quot;PlantStudio Botanical Illustration Software is a tool for creating 3D<br/>\nplant models and 2D illustrations. PlantStudio simulates herbaceous<br/>\n(non-woody) plants like wildflowers and cut flowers, vegetables, weeds,<br/>\ngrasses, and herbs using a parameter-driven simulation of plant growth<br/>\nand structure. You can &quot;grow&quot; plants over their life cycles, producing<br/>\nlifelike images at any age. You can design, animate and breed a wide<br/>\nvariety of plants. By using the &quot;evolutionary arts&quot; of variation and<br/>\nselection in the plant breeder, you can quickly and easily create whole<br/>\nfamilies of unique plants for your 3D scenes.&quot;<br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of stuff in there about angles and rotations and so on --<br/>\ncan&#39;t help but learn a little about trigonometry (and botany) even by<br/>\njust playing with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I know schools tend to focus on a chain of algebra, trigonometry,<br/>\ncalculus, (especially for kids interested in engineering) I&#39;d suggest<br/>\nlearning about probability and statistics (done as part of developing a<br/>\ncomputer simulation) would generally be a more useful mathematical skill<br/>\nin the real world for most people, since we all need to make decisions<br/>\nevery day related to risks and also trying to read between the lines of<br/>\nnewspaper articles and advertisements throwing statistics around in an<br/>\nattempt to inform or persuade us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, here is a fun link about how to lie with statistics:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html\">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/stat3.html</a><br/>\n&quot;Ok...this is what you have been waiting for.

Rather, I hope you will learn how it<br/>\nis possible to be misled and how to spot &quot;statistical abuse.&quot; You can<br/>\nfind poor use of statistics everywhere...magazines, newspapers, polls,<br/>\nTV, even research papers. I do not want to hear of any of you readers<br/>\nusing these poor methods.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is a book on that topic:<br/>\n  _How to Lie With Statistics_<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728\">http://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also a variety of free instructional videos available over the<br/>\nweb as part of the Annenberg CPB project if you have a fast internet<br/>\nconnection (and otherwise likely available from a local library or<br/>\nthrough interlibrary loan):<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html\">http://www.learner.org/resources/browse.html</a><br/>\nExmaples:<br/>\n&quot;Against All Odds: Inside Statistics; This video instructional series<br/>\nfor college and high school classrooms and adult learners leads to a<br/>\ngreater understanding of statistics by exploring authentic examples —<br/>\nfrom environmental studies to weight-loss programs.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Algebra: In Simplest Terms; This video instructional series for college<br/>\nand high school classrooms and adult learners guides students<br/>\nstep-by-step through algebra concepts, while highlighting common trouble<br/>\nspots.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Learning Math: Geometry; Learn the basics of geometry in this video-<br/>\nand Web-based course for K-8 teachers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t watched any of those, but many years ago I did go through the<br/>\nentire Mechanical Universe physics series for myself and liked it:<br/>\n &quot;The Mechanical Universe…and Beyond; This video instructional series<br/>\nfor college and high school classrooms and adult learners demystifies<br/>\nphysics and illustrates abstract concepts.&quot;<br/>\n(Physics ends up being mostly math at more advanced stages.)<br/>\nI also enjoyed their World of Chemistry, but I didn&#39;t see that is<br/>\nonline. There is also an accompanying textbook to the Mechanical<br/>\nUniverse; if anyone wanted something like a curriculum, that might<br/>\nbe a way to go which integrates mathematics into a physical setting that<br/>\nhelps motivate its study -- but you can also just watch the videos<br/>\nfor fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another general resource for math education:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mathforum.org/\">http://mathforum.org/</a><br/>\n&quot;The Math Forum is the leading online resource for improving math<br/>\nlearning, teaching, and communication since 1992.<br/>\n_We are teachers, mathematicians, researchers, students, and parents<br/>\nusing the power of the Web to learn math and improve math education.<br/>\n_We offer a wealth of problems and puzzles; online mentoring; research;<br/>\nteam problem solving; collaborations; and professional development.<br/>\nStudents have fun and learn a lot.

The Scientific Advisory Board of CMI selected these<br/>\nproblems, focusing on important classic questions that have resisted<br/>\nsolution over the years. The Board of Directors of CMI designated a $7<br/>\nmillion prize fund for the solution to these problems, with $1 million<br/>\nallocated to each.&quot;<br/>\nIt may even be fun just to look at the puzzles and think about what you<br/>\nwould need to know to even think about solving them. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a step down :-) -- the local William Lowell Putnam competition:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://math.scu.edu/putnam/\">http://math.scu.edu/putnam/</a><br/>\n&quot;Each year the annual Putnam Competition is held on the first Saturday<br/>\nin December. ... The competition is open only to regularly enrolled<br/>\nundergraduates, in colleges and universities of the United States and<br/>\nCanada, who have not yet received a college degree. No individual may<br/>\nparticipate in the competition more than four times. An eligible entrant<br/>\nwho is also a high school student must be informed of this four time limit.&quot;<br/>\nNot much money even if you win the competition, but<br/>\nperhaps a bit of glory. And something motivating for some -- to do well<br/>\nin that contest. (Well, it helps that math departments sometimes pay for<br/>\na free lunch for the contestants. :-) Although ultimately the best<br/>\nmotivation comes from within for the love of the subject for itself.<br/>\nPerhaps a competition might even be off-putting for some.<br/>\nAnyway, even if you don&#39;t want to do the competition, the support<br/>\nmaterials and sample questions may be of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a John Holt fan.

It’s<br/>\nembedded in the context of reality, and what schooling does is to try to<br/>\ntake everything out of the context of reality. So everything appears<br/>\nlike some little thing floating around in space, and it’s a terrible<br/>\nmistake. You know, there are numbers in building; there are numbers in<br/>\nconstruction; there are numbers in business; there are numbers in<br/>\nphotography; there are numbers in music; there are fractions in cooking.<br/>\nSo wherever numbers are in real life, then let’s go and meet them and<br/>\nwork with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat subject matter do you see as essential?<br/>\n<br/>\nNone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is too much mathophobia in the world as it is -- in large part as<br/>\na consequence of how math is taught in schools:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mathophobia\">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mathophobia</a><br/>\nYet higher math can be a very fun endeavor if done for its own sake.<br/>\nAs much as I like mathematical ideas, there are a lot of very successful<br/>\npeople in life who cannot do math at all.

They begin with the abstract and hope the  <br/>\nkids will extract the meaning from it. Abstract is *hard* when you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have a good feeling for what it is. Unfortunately, since  <br/>\nschools need to show that kids are learning, they have to teach in a  <br/>\nway that&#39;s testable. You can&#39;t test concepts that are being absorbed  <br/>\nin odd ways and refined as they&#39;re being used. Imagine trying to  <br/>\ndevise a standardized test for 2 year olds to measure their progress  <br/>\nin English. My daughter could say pachycephalosaurus before she could  <br/>\nsay her own name! There isn&#39;t a test in the world that would have  <br/>\ngiven a good picture of her unique progress through mastering  <br/>\nEnglish ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning math is as easy as learning a native language.
