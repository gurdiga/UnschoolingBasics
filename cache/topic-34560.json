Violence, Fantasy, Sexy girls, etc. I saw him watching some<br/>\nvideos of anime figures/characters.  He visits Manga.com too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI googled Manga, thinking it was geared toward the younger fan, but<br/>\nfound that I am completely ignorant.  I found titles that I remember<br/>\nseeing as a teenager and would rather not purchase.  I assumed Manga<br/>\nwas a style, not a company.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to start him off with some safe titles.  Is that even<br/>\npossible?  I can&#39;t see myself purchasing Ninja Scroll for my 10 year<br/>\nold.  I remember rape being such a common theme in Anime when i was a<br/>\nteen.  Is there anything in between say Pokemon and Urutsukidoji???<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... can anyone help?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34592,"nextTopicId":34634}}
