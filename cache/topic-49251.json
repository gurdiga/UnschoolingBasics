I&#39;m Johanna from Germany, Leipzig, and I&#39;m an editor and author for the &quot;unerzogen magazine&quot;. We publish articles about unschooling, respectful parenting, democratic schools etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you well known and experienced unschoolers have already written for us: Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen, just to mention a few. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe next issue&#39;s topic is &quot;partnership&quot;. We want to explore the possibility of &quot;unschooling&quot; between partners/in your partnership. We know that there are parents/couples out there who have experience with this. Who after a few years of Unschooling realized that they weren&#39;t following the same principles with their own partner! And after realizing, started working on that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has collected some of the ideas here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spouses\">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIs anyone willing to write an article for us? It could be from your own experience, from your experience working with others, an overview, a collection of tips... <br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, please contact me under: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jgm@...\">jgm@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m looking forward to read your replies!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Johanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49219,"nextTopicId":49240}}
