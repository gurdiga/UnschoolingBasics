I said yes, I was on the unschooling chat so I got off and we left. When we got to the end of our street, my oldest son (8) began objecting to McDonalds.  I didnt personnaly want McDonalds either so I suggested after McDonalds we could go to Chick fil-a.  We ended up going to the McDonalds across town,instead of the one near us, cause it is new and the kids wanted to explore it, we went inside and they ate, then went to Chick fil a and went inside and ate.  One of my sons love the little wooden dollar models from Michaels, so he asked to go there and we did, bought a few models.  Then I kind of needed a few groceries and some cornstarch to make sidewalk paint.. Ok so by now I am getting tired of running around after my 4 kids and my yes answers start getting strained.  We got brownie mix to make later and they wanted some peeps. Then my 7 year old asked if we could go look at the legos in the toy section.  By this point I was getting cranky, and we had already been to the toy section but he had somehow missed the legos.  SOOO I suggested very nicely that we go pick out a movie from the red box (on the way out of the store) instead. He went for it and off we went.  I didnt say NO to the lego excusion, just redirected him and everyone was happy.  A few days later, we went to a toy store and looked at legos.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269945934","msgId":43552,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvc2tvZSs1aGRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyOTkzRTM4LUQ0RkMtNEVDNy04RUNCLUZCMEJFOTJDMjA4REB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":43550,"nextInTopic":43557,"prevInTime":43551,"nextInTime":43553,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"LOL -- no, I think the eye rolling was the pre-teen version of what I described -- we get it already, Mom.

Most  <br/>\n&gt; parents have good reasons for their nos -- or at least believe they  <br/>\n&gt; do! ;-) And they explain why such and such is as it is to move their  <br/>\n&gt; kids from kid understanding of the world to mom&#39;s and dad&#39;s &quot;right&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; understanding of the world. There are good reasons (most parents  <br/>\n&gt; believe) for kids going to school, eating at the dinner table,  <br/>\n&gt; bathing daily, not eating sugar, not watching TV and so on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All of what you wrote here:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let go all the way and remind DS that part of having freedom is  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; being responsible. Responsible about using that freedom and how it  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; effects those around you.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Dad has to sleep. DS can turn off his own light. Dinner is ready  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; when it is ready and he&#39;s welcome to join everyone or keep playing  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and be content with warmed up dinner. Or something he makes  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; himself. That sort of thing. Freedom is not about Mom saying &quot;yes&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and everyone jumping to fulfill unreasonable demands. Freedom is  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; about respect and love going both ways.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; can be interpreted in very conventional ways and would hardly cause a  <br/>\n&gt; ripple on a conventional parenting board. To help people make the  <br/>\n&gt; radical unschooling shift, not only ripples but waves are necessary  <br/>\n&gt; to get people turned around facing the other way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *But* &quot;always say yes (or some form of yes)&quot; has it&#39;s flaws too and  <br/>\n&gt; can be more like a tsunami! Some people tend to read &quot;always say yes  <br/>\n&gt; (or some form of yes)&quot; as though it&#39;s a rule which creates a whole  <br/>\n&gt; new set of problems. It can move people too far from the land of  <br/>\n&gt; conventional no to a land of no guidelines -- expect always say yes! ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (&quot;Always say yes (or some form of yes)&quot; was never meant as a rule.  <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s meant as an aid to shift parents&#39; point of view so they can move  <br/>\n&gt; away from automatic nos towards being their child&#39;s partner in  <br/>\n&gt; finding solutions.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe it will help parents not end up in the land of no rules if they  <br/>\n&gt; see themselves as having the title &quot;See-er of the hierarchy of needs  <br/>\n&gt; and the bigger picture and the employer of greater experience.&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; Parents&#39; role is to see the bigger picture and use their greater  <br/>\n&gt; experience and skills in finding paths (solutions) that avoid danger  <br/>\n&gt; and other people&#39;s toes and allow greater priority needs (like  <br/>\n&gt; someone sleeping) to be met.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t help build the relationship if a parent interprets a child  <br/>\n&gt; fighting against reason as not understanding the reasons. (And may be  <br/>\n&gt; why your kids rollled their eyes.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First, if a child has been raised conventionally, they&#39;ve been  <br/>\n&gt; *taught* to fight for what they want because parents are roadblocks.  <br/>\n&gt; In conventional parenting, the main thrust is to stop the child from  <br/>\n&gt; doing what the mom thinks is wrong. It&#39;s not about seeing the child&#39;s  <br/>\n&gt; needs but radar going up when the child heads for a wrong path and  <br/>\n&gt; perhaps forcing the child back onto the right path. So to the  <br/>\n&gt; conventionally raised child, it will take a lot to undo the damage of  <br/>\n&gt; being adversaries until the child trusts the parent to be their  <br/>\n&gt; partner in finding some way to get their need met. So they will hear  <br/>\n&gt; no for a long time when they parent is saying &quot;Yes, but this is a  <br/>\n&gt; better way to get there.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second, lots of kids will fight against tiredness when it means  <br/>\n&gt; giving up fun things. In this case, though, it was probably a  <br/>\n&gt; combination of  tired and sick that made it feel unfair and uncaring  <br/>\n&gt; that Dad would dare fall asleep when his needs were larger than  <br/>\n&gt; usual! That&#39;s not because he doesn&#39;t understand people need to sleep  <br/>\n&gt; but because his feelings were overwhelming. An explanation would be  <br/>\n&gt; irritating. In those cases sympathy -- not followed by a BUT! -- and  <br/>\n&gt; soothing and empathy and understanding and comfort are far better.  <br/>\n&gt; (If you&#39;re prone to PMS and your husband tries to explain why you&#39;re  <br/>\n&gt; being unreasonable, does it help or is it even more irritating?)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269900737","msgId":43550,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvcjhrMStwdm1pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvcXY1bCtlZXBwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43548,"nextInTopic":43552,"prevInTime":43549,"nextInTime":43551,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************** Its a funny sort of figuring-out, because you get so used to limits and boundaries being something you set that you kind of have to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-750027343\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rebecca M.&quot; &lt;ackirebecci@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I also think that my son is trying to figure out if this is a bottomless well of yes or if there are any edges to it.

She&#39;s getting a little to big to do that without hurting me - that&#39;s a real limit, and also a chance to do some problem solving. I thought about what she needed - she needed some activity and some connection with her mom beyond watching movies.

But I know it will be difficult<br/>\n to go this route and I would really love to transition the control <br/>\nwhile still keeping in mind the principles of where we are headed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we ran into conflict, particularly w/ one of our girls, I found <br/>\nthat the reason was always because I was trying to maintain some kind of<br/>\n control.  If your son gets what&#39;s going on and you are trying to <br/>\ncontrol the process it is most likely going to cause you and him more <br/>\nstress and unhappiness.  There are going to be challenging moments no <br/>\nmatter how you go about this because it&#39;s a big change for everyone, so <br/>\none one is feeling comfortable and easily able to absorb the unbalance <br/>\nof others.  You may like to soak the bandaid off :) but if your son <br/>\nwants to rip it off he&#39;s going to keep picking and picking at it while <br/>\nyou are trying relax and soak.  Which may mean that in this instance <br/>\nripping it off will cause less aggravation for both of you.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;you<br/>\n were engaged in the &quot;yes-more-often&quot; process with your kids, how did<br/>\n you stay in alignment even when this process would push a comfort level<br/>\n or two for you?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI assure you that I didn&#39;t always stay in alignment!  But my kids knew I<br/>\n was learning and doing my best and we worked through it together.  And 6<br/>\n months down the road things in our house are light years different than<br/>\n they were a year ago - in very very positive and wonderful ways.  :)  <br/>\nBut that&#39;s another post and my girls are hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember: Nothing is more important than your relationship with your son<br/>\n :) and be gentle with your self and your family.  It&#39;s worth a short <br/>\nperiod of disequilibrium to get through to a better place :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJenna <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269865825","msgId":43543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyOTkzRTM4LUQ0RkMtNEVDNy04RUNCLUZCMEJFOTJDMjA4REB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvcTA1YytwbThjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhvcTA1YytwbThjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43539,"nextInTopic":43544,"prevInTime":43542,"nextInTime":43544,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

To help people make the  <br/>\nradical unschooling shift, not only ripples but waves are necessary  <br/>\nto get people turned around facing the other way.<br/>\n<br/>\n*But* &quot;always say yes (or some form of yes)&quot; has it&#39;s flaws too and  <br/>\ncan be more like a tsunami! Some people tend to read &quot;always say yes  <br/>\n(or some form of yes)&quot; as though it&#39;s a rule which creates a whole  <br/>\nnew set of problems. It can move people too far from the land of  <br/>\nconventional no to a land of no guidelines -- expect always say yes! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(&quot;Always say yes (or some form of yes)&quot; was never meant as a rule.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s meant as an aid to shift parents&#39; point of view so they can move  <br/>\naway from automatic nos towards being their child&#39;s partner in  <br/>\nfinding solutions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it will help parents not end up in the land of no rules if they  <br/>\nsee themselves as having the title &quot;See-er of the hierarchy of needs  <br/>\nand the bigger picture and the employer of greater experience.&quot;  <br/>\nParents&#39; role is to see the bigger picture and use their greater  <br/>\nexperience and skills in finding paths (solutions) that avoid danger  <br/>\nand other people&#39;s toes and allow greater priority needs (like  <br/>\nsomeone sleeping) to be met.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help build the relationship if a parent interprets a child  <br/>\nfighting against reason as not understanding the reasons. (And may be  <br/>\nwhy your kids rollled their eyes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, if a child has been raised conventionally, they&#39;ve been  <br/>\n*taught* to fight for what they want because parents are roadblocks.  <br/>\nIn conventional parenting, the main thrust is to stop the child from  <br/>\ndoing what the mom thinks is wrong. It&#39;s not about seeing the child&#39;s  <br/>\nneeds but radar going up when the child heads for a wrong path and  <br/>\nperhaps forcing the child back onto the right path. So to the  <br/>\nconventionally raised child, it will take a lot to undo the damage of  <br/>\nbeing adversaries until the child trusts the parent to be their  <br/>\npartner in finding some way to get their need met. So they will hear  <br/>\nno for a long time when they parent is saying &quot;Yes, but this is a  <br/>\nbetter way to get there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, lots of kids will fight against tiredness when it means  <br/>\ngiving up fun things. In this case, though, it was probably a  <br/>\ncombination of  tired and sick that made it feel unfair and uncaring  <br/>\nthat Dad would dare fall asleep when his needs were larger than  <br/>\nusual! That&#39;s not because he doesn&#39;t understand people need to sleep  <br/>\nbut because his feelings were overwhelming. An explanation would be  <br/>\nirritating. In those cases sympathy -- not followed by a BUT! -- and  <br/>\nsoothing and empathy and understanding and comfort are far better.  <br/>\n(If you&#39;re prone to PMS and your husband tries to explain why you&#39;re  <br/>\nbeing unreasonable, does it help or is it even more irritating?)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269859308","msgId":43539,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvcTA1YytwbThjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvb2NwdStnb3VoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43536,"nextInTopic":43543,"prevInTime":43538,"nextInTime":43540,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, that seems to me to be part of what is not working.

Not a happy circumstance. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all relative to age and ability and comfort levels but living together amiably isn&#39;t only about you saying yes. It&#39;s about everyone knowing that yes will always be the answer -- when possible. And when it&#39;s not possible, that there is a good reason that can be explained. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo explaining more -- even to the point of ridiculousness sometimes -- seems helpful to me. So your child knows what you are thinking and that you are not just turning off lights tonight but will stop turning them off for some unknown reason tomorrow. Or that DH needs to go to sleep but you will help figure out a way to turn off lights later. Whatever the nit-picky details are of each decision -- it&#39;s not a yes until I know why I got a yes this time and not last time. Until I know that I can count on a yes all the time -- under the same circumstances. And that the yes will be no under other circumstances. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this rational behavior does eventually lead to a child who expects you to act rationally and kindly and generously and will act the same way in return. But not if reasons are not explicitly stated during the changeover. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are at the teen stage with the two older kids with an almost-4-yo thrown in the mix now. We are constantly making plans and planning rides and scheduling this or that. But it&#39;s in consultation and consideration of the other people&#39;s plans. Everything is done to accommodate everyone and we try to make the answer yes as much as possible. But sometimes the answer really is no and the teens, and even the baby on occasion, understand it&#39;s not no out of anything but the reality of time and space.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked a lot to them when they were young. Why we were going here or there, figuring out how to do all they wanted to do or go to as much or as little as they wanted but still get things done that needed done, etc. At some point, I was informed that I no longer needed to go over the whole schedule with them and consult with them about everything, that they knew how we all worked together -- I seem to recall some eye rolling so maybe it was them being fed up with me trying to be so darned sharing and consulting with them :) -- but talking and figuring things out together seems to have resulted in people who know how to check a wall calendar -- or at least remember that it should be checked -- before promising a ride from Mom. <br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to have wandered off track here. The point is to be explicit, as much as is required. The care that you are putting into these daily decisions will be demonstrated that much more clearly, imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Rebecca M.&quot; &lt;ackirebecci@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- Nance wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Let go all the way and remind DS that part of having freedom is being responsible.

Those are gifts of kindness and grace, and also parts of a strategy for creating a more peaceful home. Its not peaceful to argue about a light when I could just as well get up and turn it off.

Most of the time, Mo&#39;s sweet about turning off the overhead light when she goes to bed - that&#39;s a hard thing for her to do, too, as its a pull-cord, not a switch and its *just* within her reach (we&#39;ve tried making it longer but George is tall and forever blundering into the thing and breaking it). Still, she does it, and that&#39;s sweet. But some nights I say &quot;could you turn the light off&quot; and she gives me a tired look and shakes her head, so I get up, out of my cozy little nest where I&#39;ve been dozing, and put out the light. In those moments I remind myself of all the times she does put the light out, or turn down the volume or shut the door or any of the hundred other little favors I might ask of her. She&#39;s not trying to be mean by saying no, she&#39;s as tired as I am, with less resources. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Dinner is ready when it is ready and he&#39;s welcome to join everyone or keep playing and be content with warmed up dinner.

The result is kids feel tossed into the middle of a storm tossed ocean without support and chaos ensues. While it works great to declare vacation from school and just plunge into unschooling, it works better to ease into applying the unschooling principles to parenting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think my son will feel the chaos and I *know* I will feel the chaos, I think that easing into it will definitely provide a better result.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; With this in mind, we are saying yes to more episodes of Gilligan&#39;s Island in the evening. And then we are saying yes to more chapters of the book we&#39;re reading aloud, even though my husband is nodding off between every sentence (he&#39;s the reader aloud person in this house). So, last night, as he&#39;s starting to snore between commas, I declared it was time for lights out (at 11 PM and my son is sick) and there was a bit of unhappiness about that, which we then talked through, briefly, in terms of tiredness of dad and sickness of kid. And I turned off the lights.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And we are saying yes to more time playing Little Big Planet (or any game) during the day. Although, I have been asking for it to be shut-off when it&#39;s time for the family meal (usually around 7:30 PM by the time the adults get it together). But this is not an easy thing for my son - he&#39;s quite willing to neglect his physical need for food, etc. (I&#39;m like that, too) when he&#39;s engaged and involved.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We are not &quot;announcing&quot; our shift whole life or radical unschooling - we were hoping to &quot;ease&quot;. However, my son figured it out very quickly and is now basically insisting that we go no-holds-barred ASAP (and gets emotional about it). He tastes the freedom and wants it now. But I know it will be difficult to go this route and I would really love to transition the control while still keeping in mind the principles of where we are headed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know that kids often will do the saturation thing when they start to truly hold the reigns of choice in their lives and I expect it. So now that he&#39;s onto what is happening, I&#39;m wondering if I have to let go of &quot;easing&quot; and let it happen, even though that will be harder transition. Or should I keep some of the control, letting go of it as it seems reasonable until a smooth-ish transition has taken place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my question really is &quot;As your family was moving toward whole life unschooling, and you were engaged in the &quot;yes-more-often&quot; process with your kids, how did you stay in alignment even when this process would push a comfort level or two for you?&quot; It&#39;s not so much situation specific, as I&#39;m doing my research on that in spades. It really is about internal process while managing the sometimes uncomfortable shifts in external control, if people care to share.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; :) Rebecca<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151979431,"authorName":"Rebecca M.","from":"&quot;Rebecca M.&quot; &lt;ackirebecci@...&gt;","profile":"ackirebecci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269725003","msgId":43523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvbHQwYis4a2RsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvbHFsZythNTE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43522,"nextInTopic":43527,"prevInTime":43522,"nextInTime":43524,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

(BTW, he&#39;s already read to the end of the book because he couldn&#39;t wait days to find out what happens - another little trait we share). He didn&#39;t complain about the lights being turned out (as he was truly tired) - he was complaining about dad falling asleep (yes, we co-sleep). I can see, though, that offering him some options (although we did suggest he could continue to read the book on his own) would have been more supportive than making an executive &quot;lights out&quot; decision (the sort of thing I&#39;d like to stop doing sooner than later - this is my knee-jerk stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Maybe if you start looking for more yesses you can find ways to invite him instead of insisting upon his attendance.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes.

I have a sign beside my computer that reads, &quot;It&#39;s *not* personal.&quot; i.e. It&#39;s not about me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have to admit that when I read Joyce&#39;s advice as quoted, I breathed a sigh of relief because it is much easier *for me* to make a slow and thorough transition into unchartered territory than to just jump in and let life get messy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems my kid is a jumper, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe did the same thing to me at birth.

My son has often commented on the inconsistencies so I suspect that is part of what&#39;s going on here  - he sees the end in sight and let&#39;s just go there, already.

In fact, as we&#39;re moving back into a parenting style that&#39;s a better fit for us, I&#39;m having flashbacks to all those lovely baby and toddler savouring times.

The other part is recognizing that in the middle of a focused activity bringing food and drink to him is a way to help him continue to enjoy what he is enjoying and to continue to be engaged without getting to the point of hunger or thirst unto discomfort. Monkey platters are a great way of helping a child to get food when they are focused on something like a game or a book or a puzzle or whatever. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a> has quite a few ideas. By helping him to keep from getting off track on some pretty basic needs, like hunger or thirst, it will make it easier for him to be comfortable and happy with what comes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is no longer able to read a book because they are falling asleep, I think moving on to something other is fine. Is there a reason why your son couldn&#39;t stay in bed, doing something quietly on his own? A why for the light to have to be turned off when reading time was over? Do you share a family bed? When we all shared a bed and David needed to sleep, doing something quietly with a really low light made it possible for the not sleepy among us to wind down. Handheld gaming systems are great for that. So are audiobooks. A quiet movie on a portable dvd player or an ipod with headphones, lots of other options beyond everyone having to go to bed at once. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point of more yesses is about looking for ways to say yes. It doesn&#39;t mean that all answers are yes, but instead of looking for ways to get him to conform to a no more gaming at 7:30, it&#39;s family dinner time, and you haven&#39;t eaten for ages, and come on, you are instead looking for ways to soften that family dinner time idea. Maybe if you keep him from getting so hungry during the evening run up to 7:30 he&#39;ll be in a better mood when it comes to joining y&#39;all for dinner. Maybe if you start looking for more yesses you can find ways to invite him instead of insisting upon his attendance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So my question really is &quot;As your family was moving toward whole life <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling, and you were engaged in the &quot;yes-more-often&quot; process with <br/>\nyour kids, how did you stay &gt;in alignment even when this process would <br/>\npush a comfort level or two for you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I changed my perspective, and I&#39;m sure it was over time, to look for ways to help my kids do what they wanted to do more and to see it less as an inconvenience to me.

And I&#39;m not sure that giving examples will actually lead to the kind of answers I&#39;m looking for (although I&#39;d be happy if it did). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m wanting to avoid is what Joyce talks about here:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One of the biggest mistakes made is after reading how conventional rule-based parenting feels and looks to kids and then declare: there are no more rules: eat whatever you want, stay up as late as you want ... The result is kids feel tossed into the middle of a storm tossed ocean without support and chaos ensues. While it works great to declare vacation from school and just plunge into unschooling, it works better to ease into applying the unschooling principles to parenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my son will feel the chaos and I *know* I will feel the chaos, I think that easing into it will definitely provide a better result.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this in mind, we are saying yes to more episodes of Gilligan&#39;s Island in the evening. And then we are saying yes to more chapters of the book we&#39;re reading aloud, even though my husband is nodding off between every sentence (he&#39;s the reader aloud person in this house). So, last night, as he&#39;s starting to snore between commas, I declared it was time for lights out (at 11 PM and my son is sick) and there was a bit of unhappiness about that, which we then talked through, briefly, in terms of tiredness of dad and sickness of kid. And I turned off the lights.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we are saying yes to more time playing Little Big Planet (or any game) during the day. Although, I have been asking for it to be shut-off when it&#39;s time for the family meal (usually around 7:30 PM by the time the adults get it together). But this is not an easy thing for my son - he&#39;s quite willing to neglect his physical need for food, etc. (I&#39;m like that, too) when he&#39;s engaged and involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not &quot;announcing&quot; our shift whole life or radical unschooling - we were hoping to &quot;ease&quot;. However, my son figured it out very quickly and is now basically insisting that we go no-holds-barred ASAP (and gets emotional about it). He tastes the freedom and wants it now. But I know it will be difficult to go this route and I would really love to transition the control while still keeping in mind the principles of where we are headed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that kids often will do the saturation thing when they start to truly hold the reigns of choice in their lives and I expect it. So now that he&#39;s onto what is happening, I&#39;m wondering if I have to let go of &quot;easing&quot; and let it happen, even though that will be harder transition. Or should I keep some of the control, letting go of it as it seems reasonable until a smooth-ish transition has taken place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question really is &quot;As your family was moving toward whole life unschooling, and you were engaged in the &quot;yes-more-often&quot; process with your kids, how did you stay in alignment even when this process would push a comfort level or two for you?&quot; It&#39;s not so much situation specific, as I&#39;m doing my research on that in spades. It really is about internal process while managing the sometimes uncomfortable shifts in external control, if people care to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks. <br/>\n<br/>\n:) Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Saying Yes - pacing help needed","postDate":"1269704878","msgId":43514,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzNDUwMy4xNjczMi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhva2F1bCtvaDJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhva2F1bCtvaDJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43512,"nextInTopic":43517,"prevInTime":43513,"nextInTime":43515,"topicId":43512,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can you give us examples of what makes you uncomfortable?

Simply say yes more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I thought. I can do that. I (we) can simply say yes more often. Yes. There, that didn&#39;t hurt. Yes. Again, I&#39;m good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how delightful it is to do! &quot;Oh, thank you, mommy,&quot; said with a beaming, loving little face and it&#39;s just delicious to be on the receiving end of that. (I&#39;d bottle it if I could!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd... that has moved very quickly into asking for more and more things that could have a &quot;yes&quot; response. Lots and lots of them. One right after the other. Boom boom boom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finding myself a bit outpaced. I guess I was hoping for a bit more time/leisure for me to adjust (let go) and for the transition to be natural without too many bumps. But at the current &quot;yes&quot; pace, there will be bumps a plenty. And I find my pull-back reflex popping up as my son peels my white knuckled fingers from the old ways of doing things. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I&#39;m the kind of person who prefers to soak off the bandage in the bathtub rather than rip it off quickly, so this pace (not the direction) is a bit outside my comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really love to hear what others have done during the &quot;yes-more-often&quot; process to stay in alignment with their kids, even when that may push a comfort level or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43547,"nextTopicId":43556}}
