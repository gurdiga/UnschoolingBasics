My point was more that people make MSG out to be this big bad chemical that does all these terrible things to our bodies, not realizing what it is and where it comes from. I have friends that won&#39;t eat anything with MSG but when pressed for information they can&#39;t even tell you what exactly it is, only that it&#39;s bad. Alergies are a different story. I have a friend that is alergic to pork. That doesn&#39;t mean pork is bad for everyone. I wasn&#39;t really speaking of alergies at all.<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Scott & Marygrace Sorensen&quot; &lt;sorensen@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid, it is not a chemical mixed up in a<br/>\n&gt; lab somewhere.
