He is a senior in high","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-908397572\">Hi Ann,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been unschooling 2 of our kids for 4 years, but my oldest <br/>\ndecided to go to school not long after we started unschooling. He is <br/>\na senior in high school now. We had been homeschooling for 4 years <br/>\nbefore unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne advantage that homeschoolers/unschoolers have is that they <br/>\ngenerally have better communication with their kids. Make sure that <br/>\nyou remember to talk to your daughter about her choice to go to <br/>\nschool with an open mind. Just like with anything else in life, you <br/>\nhave to trust that she knows what she needs. My son just had a need <br/>\nto go to school. We talked much about some of the things that go on <br/>\nat schools that has nothing to do with school or learning. We talked <br/>\nabout the possibility that if it didn&#39;t work out, that he could come <br/>\nhome at any time. He has accused me at times of trying to talk him <br/>\ninto coming home, so I try to be careful not to sound like I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael thought that he would be behind his classmates (one reason <br/>\nhe wanted to go to school, not our idea, his), but he found that he <br/>\nwas way ahead of them in many areas. The only thing he had trouble <br/>\nwith was note taking and writing in general. I knew getting good <br/>\ngrades would be extremely important to him, so we have talked about <br/>\nthat alot. His grades do not matter to me and I&#39;ve told him so. What <br/>\ndoes matter is that he gets what he needs from his school <br/>\nexperience. It does make a big difference that he chose to go to <br/>\nschool compared to the other kids that have been there doing it all <br/>\nof their life. We talk often. He is not as open with me as he used <br/>\nto be but it is really his way of separating from his mother so he <br/>\ncan grow up. When he is ready to talk about something, he knows I am <br/>\nthere with an uncritical eye and ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first couple of years there were some things that came up <br/>\nthat you do have to watch out for when you have such extremes in one <br/>\nhousehold. Our other two boys got so used to hanging out together <br/>\nthat Michael began to feel kind of separated from the rest of us. It <br/>\nwas one of those things that you don&#39;t realize that it is happening. <br/>\nI think this was part of Michaels growing up experience also. He <br/>\nneeded some space to find out just who he was. We did finally see <br/>\nwhat was going on and we try to make sure now that Michael has the <br/>\nopportunity to be involved in what his brothers do during the day <br/>\nand of course they share many friends together, most of which are <br/>\nhomeschoolers/unschoolers, but they make Michael feel right at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this helps any or not. It was hard for me to let <br/>\nMichael go to school, knowing that he didn&#39;t have to. He has had <br/>\nsome tough times with classes he didn&#39;t like so well or even in <br/>\nclasses that he loves but he feels that what the teacher asks him to <br/>\ndo is pointless! But, he has stuck to it because that is what he <br/>\nwants to do. He has managed to keep his grades at 3.0 or above <br/>\nbecause he wants to get a scholarship. (We have bright futures in <br/>\nFL, 3.0 will earn 75% paid scholarship!) He&#39;s gotten a part-time job <br/>\nin the field that he loves (computers). Our communication is still <br/>\ngood and he is a happy camper.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to be open and honest to your daughter about how <br/>\nyou feel about her going to school without making her feel guilty or <br/>\nthat you are pressuring her to change her decision. If she chooses <br/>\nto stay in school, she will remember your openness and honesty and <br/>\nwill do the same with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nRose<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, amcarlson@m... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; hello the very wise people of this list . . .I have been lurking <br/>\nand transforming for a few mos now.
