Didn&#39;t think of the natural food <br/>\nstores :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always amazed as solutions &quot;pop up&quot; when you have such <br/>\ndifficulties. Last week, after writing here and still being quite <br/>\nsad, I found a card at my drugstore (? the store where you can buy <br/>\npills and things like that) advertising for parenting groups not very <br/>\nfar from here. They don&#39;t seem to be unschoolers, more like <br/>\nattachment parenting, but it&#39;s a start. I plan to go to a meeting on <br/>\nFriday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks for your ideas, sincerely. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son still wants to go back to school, and it still makes me sad <br/>\n(not only because it gives me the feeling that I failed him in some <br/>\nway, but also because I&#39;m going to miss him ...). I guess that he&#39;s <br/>\nmissing his friends and some aspects of the &quot;group life&quot; and that he <br/>\nprobably needs to get some air (his little sister litterally worships <br/>\nhim and is always after him - they&#39;re having lot of fun, but it might <br/>\nbe too much for him sometimes). I don&#39;t know what to do, I won&#39;t <br/>\nforce him to stay at home, of course, this wouldn&#39;t make any sense, <br/>\nbut I find the idea of him going back to school a bit depressing (to <br/>\nsay the least).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Johanna &lt;dialog@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: seccotine@...<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would like to meet other parents who won&#39;t be critical about my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; choices ...

I am a single mom homeschooling, transitioning to unschooling. I am exhausted much of the time with work, housework, kids....I know how it is to have great creative ideas but not one cleared-off surface (including a floor) left, and you can&#39;t find the materials, and I&#39;m so tired....I feel for you! I have more commiseration than advice. I am aware that unschooling in Europe is less common and so you&#39;ll have a hard time getting support and there is no question that constant criticism is very wearing. My heart just aches for your statement &quot;I am not good enough.&quot;  I will leave it to those more experienced to offer you advice; suffice it to say from my end that I am deeply sympathetic!  I think I have cycled through those times an average of every 4 to 6 months since beginning to homeschool; in fact I am hoping that radical unschooling will help stop those cycles. I suspect this is a time that you can weather with some support. Are you taking<br/>\n any time for yourself?
