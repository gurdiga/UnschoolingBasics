I had an epiphany <br/>\nrecently that if I&#39;d never stopped anything that I was doing I&#39;d still be in <br/>\ndiapers, I&#39;d be a concert pianist, I&#39;d still be able to walk on the top of <br/>\nthe monkey bars, I&#39;d probably be a regional manager at McDonalds, I&#39;d still <br/>\nbe a smoker, I&#39;d still be nursing my mom, I&#39;d still be crawling, I&#39;d have a <br/>\nfull set of embroidered tea towels I started on when I was 5, I would be <br/>\nwith my boyfriend from pre-school, Oscar instead of married to David. <br/>\nSometimes you are just done. Sometimes you want a break. Sometimes you don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to knit a sweater. And sometimes you come back to those things again <br/>\nand again and again. Giving up when the going gets rough is okay. I give up <br/>\nwhen the going gets rough all the time. But sometimes I keep trying until I <br/>\nget too frustrated and then I yell and I freak out and I stomp and rage. I <br/>\ntry not to do that very often though. I don&#39;t like that feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Help me if I&#39;m wrong, here. I usually feel the situation<br/>\n&gt; out.  For example, she needed to write a &quot;thank you&quot; note for birthday<br/>\n&gt; presents the other day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why did she need to write a &quot;thank you&quot; note? What was going to happen if <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t? If you did it instead? If you just sent the original you&#39;d <br/>\nwritten instead of making your daughter feel all squitchy and angry and <br/>\npowerless inside doing something with too many letters in it? What would <br/>\nhave happened? Maybe you and she could have done something fun? Maybe you <br/>\ncould have sent some sweet little thing to friends saying how great it was <br/>\nto see them thereby cementing your friendships even further? Where was her <br/>\nneed to write those thank yous?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is part of how we&#39;re learning to write.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you having trouble with your writing? It seems pretty good from my point <br/>\nof view. Maybe when you say &quot;we&quot; you mean &quot;she&quot;? It makes a difference if <br/>\nyou think of her as an individual separate from you. It makes a difference <br/>\nif you see that what she needs and wants isn&#39;t always what you need and <br/>\nwant. You and she are individuals with different goals and aspirations. <br/>\nMaybe what she needs to figure out writing is different from what you need <br/>\nto keep your writing skills honed. Simon, my 9 year old son, has never <br/>\nwritten at my forcing. The other day he wrote something about what house he <br/>\nwas in at Hogwarts and what his pets were and what kind of wand he has and <br/>\nhis writing was so much clearer than it had been a year ago, 2 years ago. <br/>\nThe drawing and tracing and writing that he does, without my standing over <br/>\nhim and making him do school work, has made as much of a difference as <br/>\ntracing letters or dotted line workbooks did for mine in school. And it did <br/>\nso without him feeling miserable or like a failure or like he couldn&#39;t learn <br/>\nwithout being put under some sort of duresse. As a side note Simon isn&#39;t <br/>\nquite reading yet. The puzzle pieces are clearly lining up, but he isn&#39;t <br/>\nquite ready to put it all together. So what he wrote was information he was <br/>\ncopying off of the internet or that I was helping him to spell. He wanted it <br/>\nto be in his own writing though. And he wanted to finish that project.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280852700,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"&quot;Schuyler&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I&#39;ve lost it....","postDate":"1173899394","msgId":22225,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWM3NjY2YyQ1ZjAyNWQwMCQ0MDAxYThjMEBEYXZpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwZDkwMWM3NjY0NSRiNjEzYjU3MCQyNzAxYThjMEBURU5BQ0lPVVNEPg=="},"prevInTopic":22224,"nextInTopic":22226,"prevInTime":22224,"nextInTime":22226,"topicId":22129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I had a conversation about mandatory thank you s yesterday.

I do that most nights, but I was levelling up <br/>\nSimon&#39;s WoW character and was moving less actively toward bed. And as I <br/>\nnoticed everything she had done, of her own accord, generously, lovingly, I <br/>\nrealized two things. 1. If I required her to do these things, I would never <br/>\nhave known the love of her doing them for me. 2. She notices all of these <br/>\nthings that I do to make the bed we share more comfortable, easier to stay <br/>\nin once we get into it. She showed me appreciation for what I do without <br/>\never saying thank you and without having it be &quot;one of those things that <br/>\nneeds to be done in our household.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI may suggest that a thank you is a nice thing to do when we go to someone <br/>\nelse&#39;s house, but only so they understand the social norms. If they feel shy <br/>\nor uncomfortable, I am more than loud and effusive enough for their not <br/>\nsaying thank you to be that much of an issue. No one in our family sends us <br/>\nthank yous, so I&#39;m not actually all that concerned about sending ones out. <br/>\nI&#39;ll call or e-mail our thanks, but by the time I&#39;ve gone and gotten cards <br/>\nand actually sat down to write them I may have forgotten who gave what to <br/>\nwhom. Or it is a few months later and it really seems an exercise in <br/>\nfutility.<br/>\n<br/>\nRequiring a thank you from anyone really isn&#39;t evidence that they <br/>\nappreciated or enjoyed the gift. It is more evidence that they can perform a <br/>\nsocial nicety/trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;David Johnson&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dj250@...\">dj250@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 14, 2007 2:33 PM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I&#39;ve lost it....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to add, to my last post, that in all other aspects, we are<br/>\nfollowing her &quot;needs and natural interests&quot; (as a I wrote previously)<br/>\nbut that some things, such as &quot;thank you&quot; notes for presents are just<br/>\none of those things that needs to be done in our household.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Melissa :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Ren Allen<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 13, 2007 9:19 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: I&#39;ve lost it....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ Relax and go with the needs and natural<br/>\ninterests of your child, although, on a personal note, don&#39;t be afraid<br/>\nto push just a little when they get frustrated. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you elaborate on that?

But <br/>\nit&#39;s NOT mandatory. His are stunning beautiful AND heartfelt.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may think that MAKING someone write them may &quot;teach&quot; manners.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what the child learns is 1) &quot;I HATE flippin&#39; thank you notes,&quot; and <br/>\n2) &quot;I wish she hadn&#39;t GIVEN me that stupid present.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMODEL the act of writing them. Don&#39;t make them out to be a chore. Not: <br/>\n&quot;I HAVE to write thank you notes today.&quot; Instead try: &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>\nwrite Aunt Jane a thank you for that lovely sweater. I&#39;ll use the same <br/>\ncolor stationary as the yarn! And I&#39;ll enclose a photo of me wearing <br/>\nthe sweater.&quot; Keep plenty of beautiful papers, and design your own <br/>\ncards and envelopes. Have a &quot;stationary station&quot;---just for notes and <br/>\nletters.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the whole &quot;not finishing sometihng she starts&quot; crap---what may <br/>\nhappen is that she quits STARTING anything!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappens all the time. If you started knitting a sweater, but got <br/>\nhalf-way through and quit, how would you feel if your husband MADE you <br/>\nfinish?<br/>\n<br/>\nINternal motivation!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

Recently<br/>\na friend told me that the charter school in our state doesn&#39;t accept<br/>\nMath U See because it doesn&#39;t meet state standards -- &quot;Well, they<br/>\ndon&#39;t even introduce money until third grade!&quot;  Well, what 5 yr old<br/>\nneeds a book to learn about money?  &quot;Grandpa gave me this quarter!&quot;  I<br/>\nremember my niece at age 5, just lost a tooth, told us, &quot;I&#39;ll put it<br/>\nunder my pillow and the tooth fairy will take it and leave a nickel or<br/>\na quarter, or a dollar!&quot;  (And my bil said, &quot;Or a nickel.&quot;)  I think<br/>\nshe had the concept of money down pretty well!<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing how to read -- what are they discussing?  Reading readiness<br/>\nskills, or reading?  What level?  Etc.  Some kids learn to read by<br/>\nfour, but most don&#39;t.  If they want to learn to read, fine.  But I<br/>\nremember the K my son went to (private) &quot;taught&quot; the kids to read.  My<br/>\nson was reading before then, one boy wasn&#39;t.  All the kids came home<br/>\nwith a dippy &quot;I learned to read in Kindergarten&quot; thingie, but the next<br/>\nyear one mother said her son hadn&#39;t learned to read, really.  So, what<br/>\nmeasure do you use to define reading?<br/>\n<br/>\nMath?  It is a very natural, integrated part of life, despite the fact<br/>\nthat people get scared by the word often.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory and language arts are VERY content driven, so how on earth can<br/>\nanyone say what a certain age/grade &quot;should&quot; know?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd who ever said that all children do exactly the same thing at the<br/>\nsame time.  There is a normal range that walking begins, but if you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a walker by age one, it doesn&#39;t mean you have a problem. <br/>\nJust someone who isn&#39;t ready to walk yet.  My son couldn&#39;t make the<br/>\nlong E sound until 17 months.  Just a quirk of his wiring.  No &quot;long<br/>\nE&quot; lessons were ever needed, nor suggested.  Yet expecting a child to<br/>\nread at 4?  It&#39;s not only okay to wait until they are ready, 6 or<br/>\nwhenever, it&#39;s generally a good idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t bother whacking your head on a brick wall over this -- those<br/>\nthings aren&#39;t worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;thisismaggiesemailaddress&quot;<br/>\n&lt;thisismaggiesemailaddress@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; has anyone here ever looked at the scopes and sequences or list of <br/>\n&gt; things a preschooler or Kindergardener should know?
