One way feels grumbley,<br/>\nresentful, and coercive (not great energy to carry around or approach<br/>\nrelationships with). The other way feels good - it&#39;s loving,<br/>\nsupportive, and allows a little more joy into your life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll it takes is a shift in perspective! Charles Swindell said, &quot;I am<br/>\nconvinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent<br/>\nhow I react to it.&quot; Another way of saying it is, &quot;Life is ten percent<br/>\nsituation, 90% attitude - how we *choose* approach it.&quot; Attitude is<br/>\n*big*.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH and I were talking about this. If I complain about my daughter<br/>\nleaving her dishes on the coffee table, if I make a point of telling<br/>\nher that *I* had to pick them up and walk all the way over to the sink<br/>\nand clean them up, etc, then I make it that much *less* appealing for<br/>\nher to do it herself because I&#39;ve made such a big deal of how<br/>\nunpleasant it was for me to do it, and my resentment is clearly<br/>\nshowing her that it&#39;s a joyless chore that I prefer to avoid. So even<br/>\nif she does it next time, will she be doing it with a light heart or<br/>\nwill she be thinking about what a PITA it is to have to clean up? Plus<br/>\nthere was the time and energy I expended to fuss at her, and the<br/>\ncritical, conditional messages she heard in my complaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, instead, I think of how picking up her dishes is a small way of<br/>\nhelping to care for her, and it leaves her with more uninterrupted<br/>\ntime to play the game she enjoys so much, and how it&#39;s not difficult<br/>\nat all because I&#39;m walking right past them on my way into the kitchen<br/>\nanyways, and I just joyfully pick them up without saying anything,<br/>\nthen not only have I saved myself from harboring all those negative<br/>\nfeelings, I&#39;ve spared her from them, too, and found joy in my heart by<br/>\ndoing something small and simple for someone I love, but I&#39;ve also<br/>\nmodeled that picking up our messes can be just a routine,<br/>\nuncomplicated part of living together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lo and behold, she takes the dishes to the sink much, much more<br/>\nthan she ever did when I spent time fussing at her about it. My goal<br/>\nis not to raise a daughter that always takes her dishes to the sink<br/>\nbut to raise a child who feels loved, within family that lives<br/>\njoyfully. And that starts with my *attitude* when I interact her, the<br/>\nway I think about things and the corresponding feelings I bring into<br/>\nour relationship. Sometimes the dishes are a side effect of that.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"If-then contracts","postDate":"1190971797","msgId":26525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgwMTE1QzA3LTE1RkQtNDBBNi04MTlELTU3Q0JDQzJGMEQwQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26527,"prevInTime":26524,"nextInTime":26526,"topicId":26525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... Yes, your question makes perfect sense. It might help you see it more clearly if you ask yourself what your goal is. Is the goal to have a clean kitchen or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-181235645\">I got this question by email and thought I&#39;d share it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In the &quot;If-then&quot; section you were talking about just that -- &quot;If- <br/>\n&gt; Then&quot; situations, and that made perfect sense to me.  But then in a  <br/>\n&gt; later section (parenting or chores, maybe?)  You mention Cake  <br/>\n&gt; Baking - and how they should be able to bake/make messes/etc if  <br/>\n&gt; they want, but it would be the Mom&#39;s responsibilty to clean it.   <br/>\n&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t that just be part of an &quot;If - then&quot; situation?  &quot;If  <br/>\n&gt; they want to bake a cake, then they would have to do the whole  <br/>\n&gt; process of cake baking&quot;?  My daughter loves to play around in the  <br/>\n&gt; kitchen, and I always thought of the &quot;clean up&quot; as part of the  <br/>\n&gt; whole &quot;process of baking&quot;, or what-have-you.  The cleaning up of  <br/>\n&gt; making a cake is just part of the whole process of cake making -  <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Am I making any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, your question makes perfect sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you see it more clearly if you ask yourself what your  <br/>\ngoal is. Is the goal to have a clean kitchen or the experience of  <br/>\nmaking a cake? If the goal is a clean kitchen, then it&#39;s better not  <br/>\nto have children! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but why can&#39;t the goal be both a clean kitchen and a cake?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be. But ...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we have two goals there often comes a time when the two goals  <br/>\nconflict: to meet one you need to give up the other. What if your  <br/>\ndaughter responded to your contract with, &quot;Okay, then I don&#39;t feel  <br/>\nlike making a cake.&quot; What will you have gained and what will you have  <br/>\nlost? Would you rather when she grew up she had memories of a clean  <br/>\nkitchen or a particularly yummy creation?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I did crafts with my daughter it did always seem as though there  <br/>\nwas more setting up and cleaning up than crafting :-/ but I realized  <br/>\nthat if my daughter associated a tedious clean up as a necessary part  <br/>\nof crafts, then she&#39;d choose crafts a lot less. And what would I have  <br/>\ngained? A neat craft cabinet? What&#39;s the point of that!?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, clean up can be an organic part of creating. You can say  <br/>\n&quot;Could you put the milk back in the refrigerator for me?&quot; and &quot;This  <br/>\ngoes on the second shelf of the cabinet.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *accept* that the clean up is your contribution to helping your  <br/>\ndaughter explore. It&#39;s like the $30 you spend to get into the science  <br/>\ncenter. Would you ask her to pay her part of the admission price? And  <br/>\nif she chose not to, what would you have gained?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo rather than thinking about how you can make her clean up, rethink  <br/>\nthe process of cake baking. What I do is set all the ingredients out  <br/>\nin the order the recipe calls for them. I read off the directions a  <br/>\nstep at a time. When she&#39;s done with an ingredient, I put it away.  <br/>\nWhen she&#39;s done with a bowl or cup, I put it in the dishwasher.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s still some clean up at the end, but it&#39;s a lot less. And  <br/>\nsince I&#39;ve focused on trying not to associate helping me with  <br/>\nunpleasantness, she is very willing to help me out. (I have certainly  <br/>\nnot been perfect in not getting upset about clean up! But, though  <br/>\npressuring to clean up lets off steam, I can clearly see it has the  <br/>\nopposite effect on my daughter than I want.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26494,"nextTopicId":26375}}
