Also, the test can be any nationally normed standardized achievement","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684942546\">OH law says test scores OR narrative OR approved alternative - so a<br/>\nnarrative would work. Also, the test can be any nationally normed<br/>\nstandardized achievement test - so something like the PASS test which is<br/>\ndesigned to be used/administered at home would work - the laws say that<br/>\na &quot;person duly authorized by the publisher of the test&quot; is okay to<br/>\nadminister the test - I believe the PASS test &quot;authorizes&quot; parents to<br/>\nadminister it. And, the composite needs to be at least in the 25th<br/>\npercentile - that means that of every 100 people who take the same test<br/>\n(same year, same level), your child does better than 25 of them. NOT 25<br/>\npercent of the questions correct. If 25 kids get 1 right and 74 kids get<br/>\n3 right and your child gets 2 right, even though that&#39;s only 2 percent<br/>\n(assuming 100 questions for easier math), that&#39;s still the 25th<br/>\npercentile. That&#39;s not all that hard. Some homeschool support groups in<br/>\nstates that require testing do a &#39;group test&#39; day type thing to make it<br/>\neasier on folks. And, there are often former teachers (who have kept up<br/>\ntheir certification) who will write a narrative or administer a test for<br/>\nhomeschoolers - often it&#39;s inexpensive and is a way for them to make a<br/>\nlittle extra income while staying home with their own kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as how it is handled in terms of what it looks like in the<br/>\nfamily, basically the test is one day out of a whole year that is to<br/>\nsatisfy the state laws to allow the other 364 days to be free and clear.<br/>\nTest results are basically immaterial in terms of the relationships in<br/>\nthe family. And, it is done with an attitude that this is a hoop, it<br/>\nsays nothing about who you actually ARE. Some folks will do things like<br/>\nhave their child flip a coin for the answers of anything they don&#39;t know<br/>\nright off - that makes it pretty obvious that it&#39;s not about what they<br/>\nknow (and odds are they&#39;ll still get enough of those correct,<br/>\nstatistically speaking, that they&#39;ll still do fine on the test).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, too, check out what the ramifications are - what does the LAW say<br/>\nwill happen in the unlikely circumstance that the results are below the<br/>\ncutoff - generally speaking you&#39;ve got a year to get the results back up<br/>\nagain before anything happens. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
