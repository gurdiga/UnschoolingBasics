I will give it my best shot though.  I do think that moving <br/>\ninto the radical part of unschooling needs to be done slowly and <br/>\nwith much thought, kind of slithering into it at a natural pace.  <br/>\nFor our family it was a slow process simply because I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nit all at once, it just seemed to happen naturally, for the most <br/>\npart.  I think kids do better when they know what to expect and when <br/>\nyou just do 180 degree shift they don&#39;t know what is going on.  I <br/>\nlike to think of myself as someone who helps guide my children into <br/>\nthe things that feel right for them, and helping them to know what <br/>\ntheir bodies are telling them and how to listen to that.  I also <br/>\nlike to think as a team, in that we have to work together so that <br/>\neveryone is happy and joyful; sometimes that means not always <br/>\ngetting exactly what you want, but enough of what you wanted that <br/>\nyour joy is not taken.  Does that make sense?  Letting your children <br/>\ndo whatever they want, at the expense of others emotional well-being <br/>\nis not healthy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*Ds (5) digss up all the shale from the back path to make a volcano.<br/>\nDH and I both have strong feelings but work it through had allow him<br/>\nto proceed without dumping any further judgment on him.*<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you have found other materials for him that would have pleased <br/>\nhim just as much, allowed him to do his project, and not destroyed <br/>\nyour path in the process?<br/>\n<br/>\n*Another episode, DS is<br/>\nnow choosing to stay up very late (way past us guessing 3:00 a.m. or<br/>\nso) and is sleeping past noon. When we wake him for his horseback<br/>\nriding lesson he is angry that he has been woken. Now dh and I are<br/>\nwondering if we are doing the wrong thing allowing him to choose<br/>\nwhen he is sleeping half the day and so cranky. *<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there things you can do to help him wind down earlier and <br/>\nmake &quot;bed-time&quot; a WONDERFUL time of the day so that he wants to go <br/>\nto bed?  I think at 5 years old it is very hard for them to listen <br/>\nto their bodies, I think that comes with age and experience.

It also isn&#39;t safe for a 5 year old to be up by himself <br/>\nunless there is someone up with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Another episode, ds<br/>\ngoes to store and gets overstimulated (my fault ad choice for him)<br/>\nand climbs up the metal staircase for employees and won&#39;t get down.<br/>\nThen when he does runs all over the store as I try to chase him (and<br/>\ncatch him). *<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have all had episodes like this, it is part of having little <br/>\nchildren.  I either wait when I know my kids are going to handle it <br/>\nwell or I wait until my dh is home with them.  When my kids were <br/>\nlittle my husband did all the shopping on his way home from work.  <br/>\nAnother thing you can do is have a little bag with drawing stuff, <br/>\nlittle wind up toys, little hand puzzles and such that you save just <br/>\nfor errands like the store.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*Another episode, after dinner Ds wants<br/>\nme to play tag (again) with he and his friend. I say (which is<br/>\nconsistent on my part) that after dinner mommy likes to wind down.<br/>\nI like to read and be quieter and get ready for bed.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have much advice on this one except sometimes we do have to <br/>\nbuck up because the kids are only little once and there will be a <br/>\nday when you wish you could play tag again.  The other thing is to <br/>\ntalk, talk, talk so that he understands your need to settle down <br/>\nafter dinner.  I have that problem later in the night.  I need to <br/>\nread before I fall asleep, it is my way to settle down.  My kids <br/>\nknow that when it comes around 10:00 mom is in her room settling <br/>\ndown and if they need something they should probably ask before <br/>\nthen.  We have been through it enough times that they just know <br/>\nnow.  I usually do the 1/2 hr reminder, &quot;okay, mom is headed to the <br/>\nbedroom, anyone need anything before I settle down?&quot;  Of course, <br/>\nthey know if there is something important, that they can&#39;t handle on <br/>\ntheir own, I will be there. <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember too that it takes time for kids to listen to their bodies <br/>\nand to recognize what they need and how to go about getting it when <br/>\nthey have been told what to do and how to do it before.  They learn <br/>\na lot from our model too.  I have other thoughts but at this time I <br/>\ncan&#39;t find the words for them so let me dwell on them for a while.  <br/>\nHang in there!!!!!  The other thing that helped me A LOT is to read, <br/>\nread, read!!!  Anything that had to do with unschooling or gentle <br/>\nparenting, I read!!  My favorite when we first started transitioning <br/>\nto radical unschooling was Living Joyfully With Children.  I am <br/>\nbeyond it now but at the time it really helped with transitioning, <br/>\nespecially with my thinking.  I recommended that to someone else so <br/>\nforgive me if that was you and I am repeating myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\nChildren aren&#39;t coloring books.
