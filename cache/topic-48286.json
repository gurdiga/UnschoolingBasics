But if I decide otherwise I certainly don&#39;t want her to be around my son unless she is able to work a lot of her stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a good friend who also has a high spirited child & she said that she had chosen some time back that she didn&#39;t want anyone in her life who was going to be a harsh judge of her dd or her parenting. And she has surrounded herself with people who support her & care for her dd. So have I really, except for my sister. I have also allowed her judgement to affect my parenting - & it will be great to step away from that for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son really is a wonderful kid & I don&#39;t want to be bogged down by my sister&#39;s perspective of him. No-one else sees him as she does. My brother who is 10 years younger than I & doesn&#39;t have his own children has lived with us for the past 8 months & he gets along fine with ds. We&#39;re actually planning a holiday together. My friend & her dd live downstairs from us & they get along just fine with ds. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve just returned from a trip visiting my mother & she loves her grandson (there was one uncomfortable situation where a good friend of my mum&#39;s but who was a stranger to my son gave him a huge hug & said &#39;I&#39;m just like a nanny to you too&#39; this was a huge invasion of his personal space & he became angry & refused to talk to her for the next 20 mins that we were in her company). He can have difficulties in social situations at times. And empathy is something he is learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut he is not the monster child that my sister seems to be trying to convince me that he is. I think she has done it to defend the relationship she has with my son which is in stark contrast to the loving relationship I have with her daughters. First it seems it was my fault she wasn&#39;t close to him as a baby because I was prickly & then as ds got older it was his fault cause he&#39;s an awful kid. I don&#39;t know exactly what the underlying stuff is all about but the thought of not having it around me or my son feels like a huge relief. I would certainly miss my neices but I don&#39;t know that I have the ability to continue to give love & nurturing to them when my sister seems so unable to give that to my son.<br/>\nJoy <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;jimmetycricket&quot; &lt;lisa0@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m feeling very emotional at the moment.

Keeping him in smaller groups where people were already friendly to him had a substantial effect on his ability to be pleasant in the moment and learn better social skills over time. We weren&#39;t unschooling at the time, but we still found setting him up to succeed helped him learn - because he could learn a little bit at a time rather than trying to ingest a whole lot at once. Now, at 18, he has pretty spectacular social skills in a broad range of circumstances. He knows how to behave at a nice dinner party, as a waiter or salesperson, as a student, as a teacher, how to be polite to police and other authorities, and how to talk down a drunk former biker who&#39;s in the mood to rumble - that&#39;s a Lot of different skills! So setting a kid up to succeed isn&#39;t going to set him up to have poor social skills ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMo is an introvert and she doesn&#39;t like to be in the middle of things, she needs time to observe and get the hang of the scene first. In addition, she&#39;d rather do things alongside other people, sort-of with them, but sort of not - if you think about leaning on a truck as opposed to sitting across a table, that&#39;s a good analogy. She *can* be in the middle of things, if she&#39;s already comfortable with everyone *and* the dynamic, but if, say, we go visit friends and there&#39;s something exciting going on, she may be back to observing for awhile. It has helped Mo to respect all those things and set her up so she can observe, or take breaks from people, or jump in as she&#39;s ready. And at 10 she can handle quite a few different sorts of new and surprising situations and talk to people she doesn&#39;t know. She&#39;s pretty good at finding people who she&#39;ll get along with in busy scenes, like parties or events.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: please help","postDate":"1333732289","msgId":48310,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsbjg0MStoam02QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsbHBjMytyNmtwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48308,"nextInTopic":48311,"prevInTime":48309,"nextInTime":48311,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** If she s the sort who keeps a tally of every perceived ill over years, keep in mind that s about Her, not you or your son.

There are ways of living courteously with the rest of the world. That is, Moms run out of energy. Don&#39;t step on the grass means Don&#39;t step on the grass. 10 PM means there may be people who want to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes unschoolers get this notion that unschooling means freedom for the child to do whatever they want like running wildly in crowded stores, being up playing loudly all night, having what they ask for right this minute. But that&#39;s not helping them be people that other people want to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parenting would see limitations and courtesies as rules and then make kids obey them. But that works against human nature. The kids are trying to meet needs and the rule says &quot;Your needs aren&#39;t important. Other people&#39;s needs are more important than yours.&quot; Any human would fight against that. (Or end up feeling they aren&#39;t important.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works with human nature is taking their needs seriously and helping them meet them in safe, courteous, socially acceptable ways. Use the principles to help them meet their needs. Sometimes it will mean abandoning a situation they can&#39;t handle. Sometimes it will mean changing the situation to one they can handle. Sometimes it will mean asking them to wait and you&#39;ll get them what they need as quick as you can. (And then do that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest, though, is thinking ahead and heading off problems before they happen. The fewer times they&#39;re in situations they can&#39;t handle, the fewer times they&#39;re asked to contain themselves, the more energy they&#39;ll have for the times you couldn&#39;t foresee.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe proactive. Be attuned to hunger, thirst, tiredness. Don&#39;t wait until they notice since sometimes kids -- humans really! -- when they&#39;re having a lot of fun will ignore the signals until they can&#39;t stand it any longer. And then it&#39;s too late to expect socially acceptable behavior. Get them fed and watered. Get them away from people where they can recover.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware of what situations they can and can&#39;t handle. If they failed previously, don&#39;t put them in the situation again right now. Wait for more maturity. Stick to situations they can handle. And then take new situations slowly. Give yourself exit strategies. If you know, for instance, they haven&#39;t been able to be around a particular relative for more than an hour, don&#39;t plan a weekend with them at their house! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a word about Mom energy. We&#39;re actually human and do have limits. ;-) Some mothers will ignore their needs and push themselves to exhaustion. Some mothers will shut down and say &quot;No more! I&#39;m done!&quot; And, just to paint the complete picture, some mothers see all the tasks that need done for a family (shopping, schlepping, cleaning) as doing things for the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of those is best. The first models that Mom is so unimportant that she doesn&#39;t deserve to have her needs met. The second sends a confusing message that the kids shouldn&#39;t ask for more than Mom can give. But being aware of Mom&#39;s limitations aren&#39;t their responsibility! It&#39;s Mom&#39;s. The third is completely confusing to them. To them Mom is running around apparently doing what she wants, maybe even taking a break to meet her energy needs, and they get what time and energy is left over for what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny power our kids have to meet their needs comes through us. There will be times when kids need us to set aside our tiredness to meet their needs. (Especially when they&#39;re babies or toddlers! Those years take a lot of energy. It&#39;s where a village can come in handy ;-) But barring a village, it will mean feeling exhausted frequently. It does get better!)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if Mom is getting exhausted repeatedly, then Mom isn&#39;t taking her own limitations into account as she plans the day. And she needs to be more realistic about what she can accomplish in a day. Build meeting your own needs into the day. Model that caring for your own needs can be built into the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can help your son navigate reality by accepting that reality isn&#39;t a rule you&#39;re imposing. You only have so much energy, so be realistic about what you can and can&#39;t do when you&#39;re helping him. He only has the skills he has been able to master, so be realistic about what you expect of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] please help","postDate":"1333713363","msgId":48302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwMzZCQUE5LTU2QTMtNEExQi04OTkyLUY4MkIyMkNEQTEyOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsbHVuYytpbWpiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpsbHVuYytpbWpiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48301,"nextInTopic":48303,"prevInTime":48301,"nextInTime":48303,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

His &quot;kind&quot; is being forced over and over to use tools that aren&#39;t getting him what he wants: time to play uninterrupted with his friend. Do you see how frustrating that is for him? Do you see why he wouldn&#39;t want to be &quot;kind&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would apologize to him. He&#39;s feeling completely unheard. His feelings are being trampled all over to force him to not trample on other&#39;s feelings. He can&#39;t care about others if his feelings don&#39;t seem important to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than forcing him to be a principled person, use the principles to help him meet his needs. Rather than focusing on his unkindness, focus on his needs (to play with his friend uninterrupted) and help him meet them in ways that are kind, respectful and safe. Use the tools in ways that feel positive to him -- helping him meet his needs -- rather then as standards that he keeps failing to meet.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":446345040,"authorName":"jimmetycricket","from":"&quot;jimmetycricket&quot; &lt;lisa0@...&gt;","profile":"jimmetycricket","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: please help","postDate":"1333710928","msgId":48304,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsbWo4ZytkcmNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzM3MDI4MTMuODc0NTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48303,"nextInTopic":48305,"prevInTime":48303,"nextInTime":48305,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really don t think that my sister does love my son.

I have tried to discourage my son from excluding her but saw that this was not helping the situation. So we encourage both boys to talk to the younger girl in a way that is kind. So that they respectfully communicate their desire for alone time without being mean. We also encourage them to ask one of us for help if they need it. One day despite my asking him several times to speak kindly to her (combined with her mothers & my efforts to keep her occupied so they could have space) he kept speaking rudely to her. So I said one more time & we&#39;re leaving. He did it one more time & as soon as it was possible we left (I was in the middle of cooking a BBQ lunch for us all but we had planned on spending the whole afternoon together). We were still there for about 20 mins before we left , he cried & was very angry with me. When he calmed down he played with the younger girl & was very sweet with her. Anyway we left & spoke more about it on the way home until he became angry & didn&#39;t want to discuss it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past I would have just talked about it, perhaps several times. And when that obviously wasn&#39;t helping I may have partly let it go (while probably playing with the girl myself) & discussed it afterwards. I would not have threatened to leave & then carried it out. While it seemed to help in the short term he is resentful about it. The little girl was so happy when he was kind to her that she made a lovely card for him but he doesn&#39;t want it in the house. Sometimes he has fun with her as she, like him, is very active whereas the older boy is not. So sometimes he may tree climb & run about with her until he&#39;s had enough & then go back to excluding her. He&#39;ll also use her DS for long periods of time but has refused to let her play with some old toy of his that he rarely uses. If I point out to him that this is not a kind way to treat someone he can feel hurt & become very defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I feel very frustrated with this. One time we were talking about these matters & he said, But I don&#39;t want to be kind - you want me to be but I don&#39;t. I just felt despairing when he said that. How can you not want to be kind? I really am not sure how to deal with this, how to guide him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very interested in what you&#39;ve said Joyce about helping him to navigate reality.

It definitely takes time for him to warm to people & feel comfortable with them. Even with adults he knows - it takes time for him to feel comfortable in their presence.

The letter my sister wrote included pages of awful things about my son. Things that he has done or said over years. It is very painful for me & I&#39;ve spent a lot of the night crying. I&#39;ve pretty much known I guess how my sister feels about my son but I&#39;ve not wanted to face it. Now it&#39;s all out in the open. And what does that say about me that my son has been required to spend time with someone that definitely sees the worst in him & doesn&#39;t like him while I have cared for her & her children? When I was very intensively helping her I would often come away tired from all that I was doing for her & have less to give to my son. He wasn&#39;t always with me when I was helping her but when he was my sister rarely gave him her time & attention. I don&#39;t know why I did that. She has also criticised my son to other family & friends & sometimes even made unkind comments about him in front of me. At this point I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be seeing much of my sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that when he behaves in a way that is rude or unkind that it triggers emotions in me that often makes it difficult for me to think clearly & respond in a way that is helpful to my son. Much more so when it is in front of others. Maybe it is about my ego & wanting to be seen as a good mother & for his behaviour to reflect that. It is also about wanting my son to be liked & appreciated by others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son doesn&#39;t always behave in a difficult way. He does seem to go through phases where it is more full on than other times. And he does have friends & he sometimes interacts with people in a lovely way. He is shy but likes to be social with people he knows. He usually does say please & thank you. Sometimes it is not the words he is using that is rude but the tone or the way he says it - & that&#39;s tricky. He can also be very sensitive when I talk to him about how he is treating someone. He seems to feel hurt by it & become defensive & to put on a bravado that he doesn&#39;t care - when I know that quite clearly he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Deb&quot; &lt;vwb777@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think joy did a fantastic job identifying the problem with her child.

He regularly talks about<br/>\n&gt; blowing things or people he doesn&#39;t like up, or shooting them, etc. He<br/>\n&gt; can be highly sensitive & can take great offence to something that I<br/>\n&gt; would consider minor.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t help but wonder how much of this is personal temperament and how<br/>\n&gt; much is environmental.   Is there any way you can find out?  I ask<br/>\n&gt; because certain things you say, like being highly sensitive and over<br/>\n&gt; reacting to things you would consider minor, make me think there&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; hard-wiring component here of which you are not at fault.  If you keep<br/>\n&gt; in mind the great spectrum of neurological characteristics, you can see<br/>\n&gt; some people are born with sever challenges and some with seemingly none.<br/>\n&gt; The rest of us fall somewhere in between.  Perhaps there are some<br/>\n&gt; stimuli to which your son naturally reacts, like not feeling<br/>\n&gt; particularly cozy with people.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps if you find out more about *why* your son reacts in certain<br/>\n&gt; ways, you can help him adopt a more socially appropriate response.  For<br/>\n&gt; example, when my son was about 4 years old he really disliked the<br/>\n&gt; feeling of a kiss on his cheek.  Sometimes my husband and I would kiss<br/>\n&gt; him on his cheek at bedtime or snuggling on the couch or whenever simply<br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s a habit and instinct to smooch that face, kwim?   We each<br/>\n&gt; learned to tolerate what the other needed.  We needed to smooch our<br/>\n&gt; baby, he needed to not be smooched.  So we smooched less and he &quot;rubbed<br/>\n&gt; it in&quot; with his palm.  Of course he was rubbing the feeling off, but we<br/>\n&gt; all pretended he was rubbing the kiss in.  That not only helped him<br/>\n&gt; tolerate our impulse, it served as a reminder for us that our desires of<br/>\n&gt; smooching our child weren&#39;t going to supersede his need to not by<br/>\n&gt; offended by sensory input.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps your son is reacting as a way of &quot;rubbing it off,&quot;  &quot;it&quot; being<br/>\n&gt; whatever behavior offends his sensory input.  If people talk too much,<br/>\n&gt; or too loudly, or when he&#39;s trying to think, ignoring them may be his<br/>\n&gt; solution.  If he refuses to share, it may be his solution to the problem<br/>\n&gt; of seeing an injustice in the way his property is treated.  I would work<br/>\n&gt; at both you and he learning to identify what the problem is, and then<br/>\n&gt; help him come up with a solution to the problem in such a way that<br/>\n&gt; satisfies his needs and yet is socially appropriate (because that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; important, too).  For example, you might discover he ignores his aunt<br/>\n&gt; because the smell of her shampoo or breath is too overpowering for his<br/>\n&gt; sensitive nose.  Teach him to converse politely from a safe distance<br/>\n&gt; before excusing himself to go elsewhere.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do think social skills are an underrated skill that can be developed. <br/>\n&gt; Not everyone is born with the ability to model those behaviors that are<br/>\n&gt; considered socially appropriate, but their behavior isn&#39;t for no reason.<br/>\n&gt; It serves a purpose.  Your challenge may be to find that purpose and<br/>\n&gt; modify it in such a way that allows him to play by the social rules<br/>\n&gt; more.  Not only will that help heal the rift between him and his<br/>\n&gt; extended family, but he&#39;s going to want these skills as he matures<br/>\n&gt; because they make interacting with people more effective. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: please help","postDate":"1333647672","msgId":48291,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsa2xmbytuZGdsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsazhkbitidHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48290,"nextInTopic":48293,"prevInTime":48290,"nextInTime":48292,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* It might help to consider what his life might be like if you parented the way your sister would have expected.

And help him get his needs met within the boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: please help","postDate":"1333646316","msgId":48289,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsa2s1YytrMGQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpsazhkbitidHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48286,"nextInTopic":48290,"prevInTime":48288,"nextInTime":48290,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wrote: But he can be unkind , exclude people, be rude in the way he talks to others, be bossy, he often doesn t like to share, he sometimes enjoys annoying","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1619493947\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jimmetycricket&quot; &lt;lisa0@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n  But he can be unkind , exclude people, be rude in the way he talks to<br/>\nothers, be bossy, he often doesn&#39;t like to share, he sometimes enjoys<br/>\nannoying others, he can be quick to get angry.

Is there any way you can find out?  I ask<br/>\nbecause certain things you say, like being highly sensitive and over<br/>\nreacting to things you would consider minor, make me think there&#39;s a<br/>\nhard-wiring component here of which you are not at fault.  If you keep<br/>\nin mind the great spectrum of neurological characteristics, you can see<br/>\nsome people are born with sever challenges and some with seemingly none.<br/>\nThe rest of us fall somewhere in between.  Perhaps there are some<br/>\nstimuli to which your son naturally reacts, like not feeling<br/>\nparticularly cozy with people.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps if you find out more about *why* your son reacts in certain<br/>\nways, you can help him adopt a more socially appropriate response.  For<br/>\nexample, when my son was about 4 years old he really disliked the<br/>\nfeeling of a kiss on his cheek.  Sometimes my husband and I would kiss<br/>\nhim on his cheek at bedtime or snuggling on the couch or whenever simply<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s a habit and instinct to smooch that face, kwim?   We each<br/>\nlearned to tolerate what the other needed.  We needed to smooch our<br/>\nbaby, he needed to not be smooched.  So we smooched less and he &quot;rubbed<br/>\nit in&quot; with his palm.  Of course he was rubbing the feeling off, but we<br/>\nall pretended he was rubbing the kiss in.  That not only helped him<br/>\ntolerate our impulse, it served as a reminder for us that our desires of<br/>\nsmooching our child weren&#39;t going to supersede his need to not by<br/>\noffended by sensory input.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps your son is reacting as a way of &quot;rubbing it off,&quot;  &quot;it&quot; being<br/>\nwhatever behavior offends his sensory input.  If people talk too much,<br/>\nor too loudly, or when he&#39;s trying to think, ignoring them may be his<br/>\nsolution.  If he refuses to share, it may be his solution to the problem<br/>\nof seeing an injustice in the way his property is treated.  I would work<br/>\nat both you and he learning to identify what the problem is, and then<br/>\nhelp him come up with a solution to the problem in such a way that<br/>\nsatisfies his needs and yet is socially appropriate (because that&#39;s<br/>\nimportant, too).  For example, you might discover he ignores his aunt<br/>\nbecause the smell of her shampoo or breath is too overpowering for his<br/>\nsensitive nose.  Teach him to converse politely from a safe distance<br/>\nbefore excusing himself to go elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think social skills are an underrated skill that can be developed. <br/>\nNot everyone is born with the ability to model those behaviors that are<br/>\nconsidered socially appropriate, but their behavior isn&#39;t for no reason.<br/>\nIt serves a purpose.  Your challenge may be to find that purpose and<br/>\nmodify it in such a way that allows him to play by the social rules<br/>\nmore.  Not only will that help heal the rift between him and his<br/>\nextended family, but he&#39;s going to want these skills as he matures<br/>\nbecause they make interacting with people more effective. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":446345040,"authorName":"jimmetycricket","from":"&quot;jimmetycricket&quot; &lt;lisa0@...&gt;","profile":"jimmetycricket","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"please help","postDate":"1333634295","msgId":48286,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsazhkbitidHYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48289,"prevInTime":48285,"nextInTime":48287,"topicId":48286,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I posted a few weeks back about the situation between my son (9 years) & his younger nieces. How much he dislikes them being around our place & touching","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1627331697\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nI posted a few weeks back about the situation between my son (9 years) & his younger nieces. How much he dislikes them being around our place & touching his things, etc. This situation has lead to an explosion of some long simmering tensions between my sister & myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister has never had a close relationship with my son. When he was born I felt quite hurt by the lack of support I received from her & others & by the judgement I received because I was parenting differently (I was very influenced by the Continuum Concept). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was a baby & toddler my sister talks about how she felt she had to walk on eggshells around me at that time because I was parenting differently & that she always felt that she would do or say something wrong. She feels that this contributed to her lack of an early connection with my son. I think that there is some truth to this & I don&#39;t think she is the only person that felt that way. I think that I wanted everything to be perfect for my son & when others interacted with him in a way that didn&#39;t fit with attachment parenting I think that I did many times get quite &#39;prickly&#39;. But for me this was also mixed in with feeling exhausted & overwhelmed & lonely. And hurt at my sister&#39;s lack of support for me, her judgement of me & her lack of involvement with my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite this when my sister had her daughters I gave her a great deal of support & developed a very close relationship with my nieces. In part maybe I did this with the hope that she would become more loving toward my son. This hasn&#39;t happened. And in fact I think she quite dislikes him & sees him in a really negative light. She has written me a long letter telling me how she feels & it is quite painful for me to read. Some things she says are just so obviously her stuff - she says that she finds it hard that he&#39;s not affectionate (as if you only love people if they fit your expectations of how you think they should be). She struggles because he has no compulsion to be &#39;obedient&#39; to any adult. And he feels fine to refuse requests for help from any adult - even a perfectly reasonable, respectful request. Which she finds very difficult (sometimes I find this difficult myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she talks about the lack of boundaries that I set for him when he was younger & how rude & unkind he has been & is. And unfortunately I feel that there is some truth in this.  I never wanted to say no to him & I think that when he behaved in ways that violated the needs of others that I didn&#39;t deal with it very well. I didn&#39;t want to be authoritarian & ended up being very permissive. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not physically aggressive - although he could be when he was younger. But he can be unkind , exclude people, be rude in the way he talks to others, be bossy, he often doesn&#39;t like to share, he sometimes enjoys annoying others, he can be quick to get angry. He regularly talks about blowing things or people he doesn&#39;t like up, or shooting them, etc. He can be highly sensitive & can take great offence to something that I would consider minor. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome time ago I had a counselling session with Naomi Aldort with regard to some of my son&#39;s difficult behaviours. She said that I had taught my son that everything revolved around him because that was how I had treated him. And that was how he interacted with others. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is not & never has been an &#39;easy&#39; child. He is incredibly strong willed & resists being told what to do in any shape or form. I love my son with all my heart & there is of course lots of good in him, he is smart & funny & insightful (& lots of good things that my sister just does not see) & his ability to emphasise has increased as he has gotten older. As he has gotten older I have tried to change the way that I  parent in that I guide more & I do set boundaries more often. But it is a really tricky balance because of his strong resistance to being told what to do he can become very resentful & even less likely to work with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m feeling really confused. On the one hand I feel that I&#39;ve been a real doormat with regard to my sister & allowed her to treat both my son & myself in a bad way without standing up for either of us. On the other hand I feel there is truth in some of the things that she says & it triggers a lot of emotions in me. Ultimately I guess I&#39;m worried about my<br/>\nson & I have my moments when I wish he were kinder, & more generous & more polite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for reading this,<br/>\nJoy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48248,"nextTopicId":48324}}
