She is possibly a child with<br/>\nautism.  But might just be a child raised in an institution.  She has little<br/>\nlanguage.  She had more a year ago but speaks rarely now.  So what her<br/>\nactual situation is...I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you deal with her?  I want to foster attachment.  I want to treat<br/>\nher with gentleness.  She does not know any English.  I do not know how much<br/>\nCantonese she knows, where she&#39;s from they speak a particular dialect of<br/>\ncantonese anyway so we will not be able to communicate verbally.  I will<br/>\nbring a book of pictures of things to help us communicate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as possible I will use redirection if she&#39;s doing something she<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t (ie isn&#39;t safe) and keep the &quot;no&quot; to a minimum.  However, it would<br/>\nnot be outside the realm of normal for her to begin biting, kicking,<br/>\nscratching and spitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to know what you all think is the right path...or at least the path<br/>\nto begin walking.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27108,"nextTopicId":27126}}
