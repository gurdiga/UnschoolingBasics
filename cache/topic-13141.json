I think that we all filter things through our life<br/>\nexperiences and expectations.<br/>\nAh, EXPECTATIONS...mess ya up everytime.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can accept that what it is, it IS.<br/>\nAcceptance helps us navigate discussions,changes, growth and LIFE in<br/>\nsuch a healthier manner.

If an idea or philosophy isn&#39;t holding up to your life<br/>\nexperience, then state that and ask questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is certainly not the end-all-be-all of unschooling<br/>\ninformation.

Kelly and I can vent with each other, but<br/>\nfortunately one of us is usually more calm than the other when it<br/>\nhappens.  In my lesser moments I think that charging people for phone<br/>\nor email consultation sounds GREAT! I figure if my advice is worth the<br/>\nscreen it&#39;s typed on, someone will pay for it eh???<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, then I realize that I enjoy being aggravated to some<br/>\ndegree...because it helps my debate skills, causes me to think hard<br/>\nabout how to explain something and challenges my dedication to a Zen<br/>\nBuddhist philosophy of living. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, living and learning here every day....<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13135,"nextTopicId":13143}}
