Although there are Christian unschoolers who do unschool<br/>\nfor religious reasons.  :)  I met a mom at our recent curriculum and<br/>\nhomeschool fair that I invited to our group.

I did this to find an<br/>\ninclusive group for my children.

I did manage to get a group of about 20<br/>\nfamilies assembled before I moved and it even included some teens (a<br/>\nconcern of mine).

But I did read their<br/>\nmembership rules and religion or a particular curriculum isn&#39;t<br/>\nmentioned so dispite the amount of Sonlight and SOS users I am<br/>\napparently not breaking their rules by joining. They&#39;re having their<br/>\nfirst meet of the year next week for the kids to have PE so we will go<br/>\nand try it, they take off for the summer. I think I just felt pretty<br/>\nout of place though, I mean most of the people who have their kids in<br/>\nschool it&#39;s because they either don&#39;t know about homeschooling, don&#39;t<br/>\ncare or they have to work.

From what I<br/>\nunderstand they are mostly Christian school at home types but they<br/>\ndon&#39;t ask for a declaration of faith and from what I understand they<br/>\nhave a couple of ecclectic families.

He talks and<br/>\ntalks and tells lots of stories but he doesn&#39;t really converse well,<br/>\nhe does more of a one sided talking.

I have started a local yahoo group which has a few<br/>\nmembers but none of them are really local so it&#39;s not like we can get<br/>\ntogether. I also started a yahoo group for kids to connect whether it<br/>\nbe by email, skype talking, sharing xbox live or IM handles, etc. but<br/>\nso far my son hasn&#39;t done much there either (but we keep trying!)  <br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t mind my son playing with the school at home types but<br/>\nwhen they ask to bring out their computer games and then they get a<br/>\nfirm &quot;you are not here to play with that you are here to exercise or<br/>\nplay outdoors etc&quot;  it just throws a big wrench in things because they<br/>\nare so controlling of their kids and my son would have gotten a great<br/>\nkick out of playing games with them so now their all unhappy, etc.<br/>\nPlus many of the kids are really mean, bullying the other kids and my<br/>\nson will pretty much always tell them he doesn&#39;t think that is<br/>\nappropriate and will just come back to me and rather talk to me than<br/>\nplay with the kids like that (who could blame him?) I think my son is<br/>\ndoing well in most areas of his life but making friends and holding<br/>\ndown a conversation are just really hard for him. I&#39;m not sure what<br/>\nI&#39;m asking for perhaps some insight from some who have gone through<br/>\nthis, perhaps I am just venting as sometimes writing it all out makes<br/>\nme feel better.
