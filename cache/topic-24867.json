Find a way to get some of the other<br/>\npressures off your plate, so that you have abundant patience for him,<br/>\nabundant calm for him, abundant love and acceptance for him.

Poor guy! Especially if it&#39;s an ear<br/>\nthing (the dairy often affects the Eustachian tubes, clogging them -- we use<br/>\near candles) or a headache. The simple answer is don&#39;t have him in those<br/>\nplaces. Your kid is more important than whatever event it is that freaks him<br/>\nout, sometimes that even means once in a lifetime events -- HE is once in a<br/>\nlifetime right now. Take him outside so his siblings can play the piano and<br/>\nsing. Put him in a quiet corner of the house. If you&#39;re there and he&#39;s<br/>\ncurled up, redirect pedestrian traffic away from him, speak to him<br/>\nsoothingly and calmly. He&#39;s coping the best way he can. Help him find new<br/>\ncoping mechanisms, brainstorm collectively for ideas that are win/win,<br/>\ncommunicate honestly which situations work and which don&#39;t and why, support<br/>\nhim in avoiding that which makes him *crazy* and act out, give him<br/>\nopportunities to Shine and notice where he is already shining and uniquely<br/>\nhimself.
