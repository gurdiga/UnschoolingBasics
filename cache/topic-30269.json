Our days seem so hap-hazard.  I <br/>\nhave been trying to engage my kids interesting topics, activities, <br/>\nprojects.  I&#39;m not forcing them to do anything they don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndo.

My 10 year old is stuck on a new passion which is fine but <br/>\ntwirlings on a chair in front of his computer with little focus.  He <br/>\nseems to want some direction but isn&#39;t taking any.

It&#39;s very<br/>\nfrustrating.  I know.  That is the reason why we decided to see a<br/>\ntherapist.  He doesn&#39;t say or do these things anymore, unless he&#39;s<br/>\nhaving a really bad moment.  Because they&#39;re infrequent, we can work and<br/>\nlearn from them.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the meantime, he really sounds miserable and as an integral part of<br/>\nthe family is making everyone else miserable.  You can&#39;t fix him, but<br/>\nmaybe you can show him you take interest in making sure those things<br/>\nthat are important to him are kept away from your children&#39;s reach.  If<br/>\nfor no other reason than to eliminate the possibility of him utilizing<br/>\nthe kids as scapegoats.  If you see he places something within the kids&#39;<br/>\nreach, gently remind him the kids can get at it and maybe even offer to<br/>\nmove it to a more secure location.<br/>\n <br/>\nHave you asked him what specifically it is he wants from you?  I know<br/>\npart of the problem with my dh was he didn&#39;t know how to articulate his<br/>\nneeds and wants and was holding me responsible for not fulfilling them,<br/>\nleaving us both disappointed and frustrated.  You being left feeling<br/>\nlike he&#39;s getting away with his behavior in an attempt to achieve peace<br/>\nisn&#39;t fair for anyone.  Defending yourself and attempting peace are not<br/>\nmutually exclusive, you know?  Even His Holiness The Dalai Lama has<br/>\nexpressed remorse over not leading his people in taking defensive action<br/>\nagainst the Chinese, and learned in the process that defending oneself<br/>\nis not disruptive to one&#39;s journey to enlightenment, nor is it<br/>\nnecessarily the antithesis to peaceful living.

I guess if it were just me then it would be fine. But<br/>\nthen (in front of the children) he says stuff like how I can just raise<br/>\n&quot;my<br/>\nkids&quot; and that he&#39;s done with it all. Or he blames the children for<br/>\nthings<br/>\nthat go wrong (if he can&#39;t find a book, his wallet, etc he&#39;ll say &quot;the<br/>\nkids<br/>\nare always losing my stuff&quot; or something to that effect).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this evening he asked me to open a can of spaghetti sauce, so I<br/>\ndid..but I left the top on it. I thought he would be using it right<br/>\naway.<br/>\nThen..about 15 minutes after I open the can, I hear this yell from the<br/>\nkitchen. And he&#39;s mad at me because I left the top on and it sunk into<br/>\nthe<br/>\ncan. I apologize, ask if I can do anything to help. His response &quot;NO.<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I get for asking for your help.&quot; He continues on with some<br/>\nother stuff (usually he&#39;ll continue talking about me out loud. I&#39;m<br/>\nassuming<br/>\ntrying to goad me into a fight, but I generally refuse to go along for<br/>\nthat<br/>\nride). I had tuned him out and put my headphones back on. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess in the midst of my learning to be peaceful, I feel like he&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;getting away with&quot; his behavior. There&#39;s nothing that he&#39;s losing on<br/>\nhis<br/>\nend, at least nothing that I can see. I&#39;d like to not see him as getting<br/>\naway with bad behavior. I don&#39;t think that point of view is helpful. How<br/>\nelse can I look at it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if this is taking up time here.

To this day, he sometimes slips and<br/>\nbegins down a path of regression.  After a couple of years of<br/>\ncounseling, which I recommend, we were able to work through that.  For<br/>\nmy dh it was a feeling of powerlessness and vulnerability; 2 emotions<br/>\nmost men have trouble dealing with him.  Most men feel they&#39;re<br/>\nprogrammed to fix things, and when they can&#39;t, in the case of your dh<br/>\nand mine, they look to blame.  This is what I call the &quot;stubbed toe<br/>\nreaction&quot; where you blame the table for being where it is when you<br/>\naccidentally crush your toes as you&#39;re walking by.

I think he knows that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat&#39;s even more frustrating is he&#39;s using what happened as &quot;evidence&quot;<br/>\nthat your method of parenting is not working.  Once in a while my dh<br/>\nstill brings up the same argument.  I realize, however, he brings it up<br/>\nduring moments of frustration.  I usually don&#39;t address it at the time,<br/>\nrather I wait for a good calm moment to address his concerns.<br/>\nThankfully, we end up agreeing.  Where we&#39;ve had issues come up is when<br/>\nit goes beyond frustration and he treats dd in a non-unschooly manner<br/>\n(I&#39;m still working on it).<br/>\n <br/>\nI believe what helps is my ability to, usually, understand that I have a<br/>\nlot more exposure and a lot more info. about our parenting methods, and<br/>\nrecognize how grateful I am that he appeases me as we learn together.<br/>\nIf you can step away from the impulse to become defensive and try to<br/>\nunderstand what he&#39;s feeling and what he needs, you&#39;ll be better able to<br/>\nfulfill that need which will diffuse his frustration/fear/concern.<br/>\nThis, imo, is best done when he&#39;s no longer upset.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I would ideally say to dh in your situation is &quot;I&#39;m sorry.

It literally saved my marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a Catholic church-based marriage &quot;rescue&quot; program (a huge goal of <br/>\nthe Catholic church!), but any denomination may attend (or NO <br/>\ndenomination, in my case---they even accept atheists! &lt;g&gt;). It was one <br/>\nof the hardest weekends of my life. In fact, it may have been THE <br/>\nhardest weekend. But it started me and Ben on the road to healing an <br/>\nalmost broken marriage by opening up communication and understanding <br/>\neach other&#39;s points of view. We had essentially given up, and neither <br/>\nof us had much hope for our marriage. It was POWERFUL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think y&#39;all are communicating well---and even if you are, I <br/>\nthink you are coming from complete opposite ends of the playing field <br/>\nand can find no common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a SERIOUS weekend devoted to healing your marriage. It&#39;s not a <br/>\nguarantee, but I *know* it can help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRetrouvaille is free (although donations are graciously accepted) at a <br/>\nhotel---no children, no cell phones, no outside communication allowed. <br/>\nThey feed you and everything. It&#39;s *all* about you two for three days.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though unschooling seems to be getting in the way---or even <br/>\n*causing* the problems---I think it&#39;s much deeper than that. Please <br/>\nconsider Retrouvaille!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to talk with you offlist, if that would help.

He had opened up all of the drawers, and then the dresser started<br/>\nto fall down on him.  Dh and I grabbed the dresser and the drawers as they<br/>\nspilled out.  Dh hurt his knee.  He blamed my &quot;loose parenting&quot; for his<br/>\npain.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I tried to explain to  him that I wasn&#39;t being a loose parent.<br/>\nHad I known the dresser would fall I would have stopped Khalid.  (just an<br/>\naside: after the dressers fell Khalid was very scared.  I hugged him and<br/>\nasked him if he was okay.  He said yes, but he was more concerned about how<br/>\nhis father felt, and was worried about daddy being mad at him).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay...so I try to get my point across to dh about how I want to live<br/>\npeacefully, how if I were to die tonight the dresser wouldn&#39;t be important,<br/>\nhow I want to live in joy and peace.

I&#39;m surprised because I&#39;m not<br/>\nworried..but it is frustrating.  Is there anyone else going through this? Is<br/>\nit either &quot;my way&quot; or &quot;his way&quot;?
