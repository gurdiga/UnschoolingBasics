He did do some stomping around and being<br/>\ngenerally grumpy and making everyone uncomfortable too.<br/>\nWhat changed?<br/>\nWow...that&#39;s a story that spans years and a separation and counseling.<br/>\nMostly, I put my foot down and told him that certain things were not<br/>\nacceptable. Ever. I was willing to be a partner if he was willing to<br/>\nreally examine issues and work harder to be not only respectful but<br/>\ndemocratic. He&#39;s really a pretty laid back guy over all, but he picked<br/>\nup some not-so-helpful behaviors from both societal messages and his<br/>\nraising.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like layer upon layer we both extract and refine this stuff.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t magically go away, but it got better and better over the<br/>\nyears. Some things were better because I was unwilling to live with<br/>\nit. A lot of it got better because he really cares very deeply about<br/>\ndoing better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur latest intense discussion revolved around my pointing out his<br/>\nability to disconnect at times and leave a lot of traditional &quot;female&quot;<br/>\nroles to me. I was the stay-at-home parent for most of our marriage<br/>\nbut I&#39;m not anymore and yet a lot of the caretaking roles were still<br/>\nbeing left to me. We had a great discussion about how his Dad was<br/>\nloving and a good provider, but hugely uninvolved and the messages he<br/>\npicked up from that raising.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe realizes that his natural inclination is to disconnect over certain<br/>\nthings. He&#39;s been extra available and connected since that<br/>\ndiscussion....even taking the kids to their dentist appointments last<br/>\nweek, something I would normally have handled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think it takes someone who is willing to change and sees<br/>\nwhere they can do better if they are being controlling and/or<br/>\ndisrespectful (I had a lot to learn about that too). I think it takes<br/>\na certain ability from the other partner to not allow themselves to be<br/>\nwalked on or treated poorly. A big dose of forgiveness and space is<br/>\nhelpful too. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] FOR REN: resending verbal abuse query","postDate":"1202870188","msgId":29676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3NDMyMS4xNDAyMS5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29678,"prevInTime":29675,"nextInTime":29677,"topicId":29676,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Ren, I m not sure if you missed this one - might have been lost in the shuffle, and I would love a response, thanks :o) I remember in a post not that long","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1371918981\">Hi Ren, I&#39;m not sure if you missed this one - might have been lost in the shuffle, and I would love a response, thanks :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n    I remember in a post not that long ago you mentioned that you had some issues with emotional/verbal abuse early in your marriage, but not now.  Would you be able to share what made the difference?  What changed?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I picked up the book &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship&quot; at the library after it was suggested by someone in this group, and it&#39;s rather discouraging how much of it fits for Ryan and I right now.  Especially since we have put rules to rest in our home, I have noticed Ryan getting triggered even more by all that is out of his control, and often it&#39;s me that takes the brunt of it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I would be happy for you to email me offlist if that&#39;s what you&#39;re comfortable with, or onlist if it could possibly help anyone else.  I don&#39;t have an issue at all with airing this in front of the group, since I would suspect that there is the odd other couple out there who has had a rocky time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jodi <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?
