I <br/>\nexplained to him that somethings about school are fun but also <br/>\nexplained that we do all those fun things at home and with friends <br/>\nanyway. He has expressed a desire to go (especially after playing with <br/>\nschooled friends or wanting to play with them and they are in school. )<br/>\nIt is hard for him to understand he wont be able to see those friends <br/>\nall day cause they are a different age.

When you can trust your child to be honest with you and you can be honest, too, that&#39;s when you two can learn and grow together. Life is an experience with an end goal.  Not some mandatoy set of rules that must be reached and followed in a set pattern.   Sometimes life throws things at you , you never expected nor wanted but by staying rigid in these pre-described patterns, you are doomed to fail.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  These last few weeks have been some of the tough ones for us.  I recently posted of my daughter losing her two best friends.  Well, life continues to be rough as she at 11.75 grade level, on an accelerated level, has decided to walk away from it all.  She was always the perfect student.  She&#39;s giving up scholarship, prom and everything else, as she can&#39;t take being at the school any longer.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  She now chooses to join my son in unschooling.  This summer she will pursue her pilot&#39;s license.  Re-start martial arts and yogo. And start training to becoming a firefighter.  I can totally relate to her current stress and commend her for finding a positive direction through it.<br/>\n  Talk to your kids!  Respect them! They are ours far too short of a time to do otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBored stiff?

You will be called upon to enforce homework, and to &#39;do something&#39; about any behavioral issues he may have.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\nI would like to know why he wants to resume school - I guess that he misses his friends and some of the aspects of the &quot;collective life&quot;, but I&#39;m not sure. He said that he wants homework, so maybe he wants to do more craft work ?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  What has Sylvian said about why he wants to go?  He really wants homework?  So, do some schooly things.  You can print up math worksheets (Andy used to enjoy these, but nor for the past year or so -- it&#39;s my inlaws influence) and let him &#39;assign&#39; it to himself or come up with his own homework schedule.  Just the other evening, Andy wrote out a very detailed schedule of &#39;practice&#39; times for his harmonica and juggling pursuits -- he&#39;s never had formal lessons for those, but feels a need to practice.  Maybe he needs to feel like he&#39;s &#39;doing&#39; more than it feels right now.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At 6, if he&#39;s been in school, how long has he been out?  Are y&#39;all still de-schooling, and could this be part of that process?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nSo how can I understand more what he wants ? When I ask him, I don&#39;t really understand his answers, he mixes so many elements. He knows that I would prefer to go on with unschooling so he also tries to find explanations to &quot;please&quot; me ... How can I make him understand that, though I would miss him and our unschooling life, it&#39;s OK for me if it&#39;s better for him to go to school ? Or, rather, how can I convince myself that, though I would miss him, etc. ? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Personally, I don&#39;t think anything could convince me school is better for my (or any) kids who have the option to unschool, so I understand how hard this it.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maybe, instead of asking him why he wants to go to school, ask him what he expects to find there.  Listening to what his expectations are could help you find ways to give him those experiences/feelings at home.  Does he want/need more friends?  Or a sense that he&#39;s doing something? Or more structure at home?  All of those things can be met at home.  Maybe he needs something that&#39;s just his, about him?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, how much would his days and weeks change if he was in school?  Has he thought about that?  A couple of weeks ago, both Andy & Dan started saying the wanted to go to school -- Andy definitely for college, maybe he should go for middle or high school?  (I have to say I would do everything in my power to keep a child home from middle-school specifically).  Dan -- kindergarten age -- said he&#39;d like to go next year.  Now, while it&#39;s obvious to anyone who knows Andy that school would be a disaster (he has some very quirky OC-like issues) Dan&#39;s pretty &#39;normal&#39; and easygoing for a 6yo. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  However, both are a bit feral -- uncombed hair, Dan will wear the same clothes for 10 or more days, both sleep late and start out kinda slow, Andy is very stream of consciousness and will talk your ear off. So I point out things that wouldn&#39;t be a good fit for them --   &quot;you&#39;d have to wash that hair coupla times a week, and we&#39;d have to comb out the tangles every day.&quot; or &quot;well, yeah, recess looks like fun, but it&#39;s only 20 minutes, and you&#39;d have to wait for a turn on the swings/slide/climber with a couple of hundred other kids -- no guarantee you&#39;d even get a turn.&quot;   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he needs to go back to school, what can I do to accompany him in this decision ? Is it better to tell him that he can go there, see if he likes it, finds what he needs and if it&#39;s not the case, he can stop again ? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Here it can get sticky. Today, schools expect kids to miss school only a very few days -- letting him stay home when he&#39;s not really sick can lead to truancy charges against the parents in our state.  Once the school gets that word into its head, they can make it very hard to homeschool, calling every choice the parents makes into question.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sure, he can quit whenever he chooses, but it needs to be a clean break, with no going back and forth -- that would be an invitation to CPS and everyone else into your home and parenting choices. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  You have several months before school starts back up for the year -- listen to what he thinks school can/will mean for him and find a way to meet those needs at home.  Maybe take a few weeks to stop talking about it and just live your life with Sylvian.  By spending energy on the school question you&#39;re missing out on time you could be living as if school doesn&#39;t exist at all.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Gary (dh)<br/>\n  Will (22) Andy (10-1/2) and Dan (6) <br/>\n   <br/>\n      A friend is someone who knows your song, and sings it to you when youve forgotten it yourself.<br/>\n~Alan Cohen<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com\">http://ourhapahome.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNow that&#39;s room service!
