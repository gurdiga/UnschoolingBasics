That <br/>\nkind of stuff.  Real world stuff you and he can do together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Reading- my 6 year old wants to learn to read badly...mainly because <br/>\n&gt;he can&#39;t read what is on his Pokemon gameboy game. : ) So I thought <br/>\n&gt;I would sit down with him Teach Your Child to Read in 100 easy <br/>\n&gt;lessons. They are short lessons. Would you all agree with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope!  I think it&#39;s much better to sit with him and help him read <br/>\nwhatever needs to be read until he can do it himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I really want my kids to have a good basis in reading and math which <br/>\n&gt;yes comes from everyday life. It&#39;s the more advanced stuff they may <br/>\n&gt;need later on in life for college that I am worried about.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t worry about it!!  When they need it, they&#39;ll learn it <br/>\nthen!  And, they&#39;ll learn it better than they would if they learned <br/>\nit before they needed it!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a brief anecdote:  When my son was born, I was determined not <br/>\nto go back to working outside the house &#39;cause I wanted him to have a <br/>\nfree uninstitutionalized life.  I wanted to work from home, and I <br/>\ncould type, so I thought I&#39;d try to get work typing manuscripts and <br/>\nstuff like that.  Someone suggested that medical transcription would <br/>\nbe very lucrative, but you need to learn how to do it.  I took a <br/>\ncourse and learned everything I needed to know.  I needed to know it, <br/>\nso I learned it.  It was a lot of the same basic anatomy stuff that I <br/>\nhad learned in school, but I didn&#39;t need to know it then, so I forgot <br/>\nit; in fact, I never *really* learned it.  But, now, when I needed <br/>\nit, I had no problem learning it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, kids who live a free life, are learning something <br/>\nmuch better than all that external stuff.  They&#39;re learning their own <br/>\nminds!  And, I think that gives them an edge over most other folks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: is it enough?","postDate":"1149724528","msgId":14155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODU4QTRGQ0UyMkY0NC0xNEE4LUVCMkBtYmxrLWQyNS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGU2N29nYitmMWRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14154,"nextInTopic":14156,"prevInTime":14154,"nextInTime":14156,"topicId":14142,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They are happiest<br/>\n  &gt;when unschooling, but I always chicken out and make them do work<br/>\n  &gt;before too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One reason they may be reluctant to venture away <br/>\n  from the things they love doing to the exclusion <br/>\n  of anything else is that they may be anticipating <br/>\n  the return to being made to do stuff. They may <br/>\n  be waiting for you to chicken out once again and <br/>\n  put an end to their freedom of choice. But, you <br/>\n  said yourself that they are happiest when <br/>\n  unschooling, and happiness can be the most educational thing of all!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Having said all that, what would do you think it <br/>\n  would look like for them to &quot;choose to do <br/>\n  anything educational&quot;? Are you expecting them to <br/>\n  walk over to the bookshelf and grab a physics <br/>\n  textbook? Or a spelling workbook? Why on earth would they do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you could relax a little with this thing, you <br/>\n  could begin to see how all the things they need <br/>\n  to learn are contained in the passions they <br/>\n  gravitate to (pardon the dangling <br/>\n  preposition!). My 11½-year-old son loves to play <br/>\n  Yu-Gi-Oh, he loves to play World of Warcraft, and <br/>\n  he loves to play various video games. There are <br/>\n  a few TV shows he likes to watch. None of this <br/>\n  stuff would look educational to most folks, but <br/>\n  he learns from everything he does! He is <br/>\n  learning to read, to write, to spell, to <br/>\n  calculate, to understand time, and to solve <br/>\n  problems. He is learning to research and wants <br/>\n  to design his own video games. He&#39;s not an avid <br/>\n  book reader; he&#39;s just not interested. But, as <br/>\n  we drive down the road he loves to try to read <br/>\n  just about every sign he can, and we talk about <br/>\n  it all. He loves to buy new Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and <br/>\n  he has to figure out how he&#39;ll afford to buy what <br/>\n  he wants. He budgets for this. He does amazing <br/>\n  calculations in his head to keep score during YGO <br/>\n  duels! He astounds me!! He has to write <br/>\n  messages to his co-players on WoW on the fly. He <br/>\n  has to read prompts and other information on <br/>\n  video games. He has to navigate around a large <br/>\n  map on WoW. I would be honored and delighted to <br/>\n  help him, if he asks, but he rarely, if ever, does!<br/>\n<br/>\n  A year ago, he was not reading or writing at <br/>\n  all. I had no idea about the kinds of <br/>\n  calculations he was able to do because I don&#39;t <br/>\n  test him (of course), but he has an amazing mind for calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If he ever needs to, I have no doubt he will be <br/>\n  able to pass any basic skills test without <br/>\n  breaking a sweat. He has never chosen anything <br/>\n  &quot;educational,&quot; and yet he seems quite <br/>\n  educated! And, he&#39;s really nice and wonderful to <br/>\n  be with and we NEVER lock horns about what he&#39;s <br/>\n  doing. He feels honored and respected, and he <br/>\n  respects me, too. All of this, I believe, stems <br/>\n  from his choices being honored.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Try to see what the educational perks are of the <br/>\n  things your kids love to do.

They may decide later that they do<br/>\nindeed want to go to college and *then* they can work on the<br/>\nrequirements needed to attend college.  And college doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\nstart at 18.

She very focused on trying to get<br/>\nout of this one area that she is stuck on.  She&#39;s been on message<br/>\nboards and IMing friends and looking up walk throughs and cheats.<br/>\nWhat has she learned?  Hmmm.  All the things I listed above,<br/>\ninterpersonal communication skills, research skills and that the cat<br/>\nbox needed changing (which she did).<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Elayne (age 10) has been mostly watching this, reading a few<br/>\nbooks, hula hooping, helping me with tidying up the kitchen, watching<br/>\na few movies with me, dancing, singing, and eating ice cream.  What<br/>\nhas she learned?  Probably all the above, plus rhythm, tempo, scales,<br/>\nand a host of things from asking a million (and one) questions while<br/>\nwatching movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeon (age 8 in 2 weeks) has also been helping Emily work through this<br/>\none problem.  He&#39;s eaten a ton of cereal while doing so.  Today he<br/>\nmade his sisters lunch (ramen noodles) and figured out how to make a<br/>\ndouble batch rather than making two seperate batches.  Water the<br/>\ngarden and harvesting some ripe vegetables.  What has he learned?<br/>\nTONS!  It&#39;s amazing to watch his mind go.  It&#39;s fantastic to see him<br/>\nget so excited over a cucumber!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle (age 41 on Sunday)  I&#39;ve been watching this whole event<br/>\nunfold.  I&#39;ve washed a bit of laundry, tidied a few rooms, done some<br/>\ntai chi, pet the cat, read 3 books (yes; in two days), cooked a few<br/>\nmeals, done a few dishes, went out with the kids for ice cream when<br/>\nthey all looked like they could use a break, dealt with a newspaper<br/>\ndelivery issue, wrote out bills, dealt with a problem a friend was<br/>\nhaving, answered a help call from La Leche League and remembered to<br/>\nleave the light on for my coparent who was coming home late.  What<br/>\nhave I learned?  I think you get the picture.

My 11½-year-old son loves to play <br/>\nYu-Gi-Oh, he loves to play World of Warcraft, and <br/>\nhe loves to play various video games.  There are <br/>\na few TV shows he likes to watch.  None of this <br/>\nstuff would look educational to most folks, but <br/>\nhe learns from everything he does!  He is <br/>\nlearning to read, to write, to spell, to <br/>\ncalculate, to understand time, and to solve <br/>\nproblems.  He is learning to research and wants <br/>\nto design his own video games.  He&#39;s not an avid <br/>\nbook reader; he&#39;s just not interested.  But, as <br/>\nwe drive down the road he loves to try to read <br/>\njust about every sign he can, and we talk about <br/>\nit all.  He loves to buy new Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and <br/>\nhe has to figure out how he&#39;ll afford to buy what <br/>\nhe wants.  He budgets for this.  He does amazing <br/>\ncalculations in his head to keep score during YGO <br/>\nduels!  He astounds me!!  He has to write <br/>\nmessages to his co-players on WoW on the fly.  He <br/>\nhas to read prompts and other information on <br/>\nvideo games.  He has to navigate around a large <br/>\nmap on WoW.  I would be honored and delighted to <br/>\nhelp him, if he asks, but he rarely, if ever, does!<br/>\n<br/>\nA year ago, he was not reading or writing at <br/>\nall.  I had no idea about the kinds of <br/>\ncalculations he was able to do because I don&#39;t <br/>\ntest him (of course), but he has an amazing mind for calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he ever needs to, I have no doubt he will be <br/>\nable to pass any basic skills test without <br/>\nbreaking a sweat.

They are happiest <br/>\nwhen unschooling, but I always chicken out and make them do work <br/>\nbefore too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old reads alot of books on her own, on a variety of <br/>\ntopics. She just learned to read, so I guess she is still excited <br/>\nabout it. I can&#39;t see her doing any math without being pushed <br/>\nthough. The only writing she does on her own is at runescape.com to <br/>\nchat with her friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 year old will read fiction and non-fiction, but doesn&#39;t do any <br/>\nkind of math. He writes emails and a little for website. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12 year old doesn&#39;t want to do anything but play video games. The <br/>\nonly book I could get him to read is The Anarchist Cookbook, and <br/>\nalthough he is interested, none of the projects in there are safe <br/>\nenough to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow could that be enough? How will they pass their GED with no <br/>\nformal schooling? They don&#39;t seem to choose to do anything <br/>\neducational on their own.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14377,"nextTopicId":14450}}
