Make a list of Fun <br/>\nthings y&#39;all would like to do - not &quot;fun and educational&quot; per se, <br/>\nalthough you can go to the aquarium or art museum if it sounds like <br/>\nfun to both of you.

Since you&#39;re <br/>\nthe grown up, you get to be the one to show a little extra <br/>\ngraciousness in the process. Its not *so* hard if you can remember <br/>\nto look at your lovely boy and think about how much you love him, <br/>\nrather than trying to &quot;win&quot; the negotiation. Do some fun things just <br/>\nfor him. The sight of your happy, shiny kid will make saying &quot;yes&quot; <br/>\nworthwhile. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I tend to have more negative interactions with my son when I have <br/>\n&gt; spent time with my own mother, and the more I&#39;ve seen her, the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>worse <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it can be. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Old baggage can weigh you down, for sure. It helps to keep in mind <br/>\nwhat you already know - that spending time with your mom stirs up a <br/>\nwhole lot of bad habits. Talk with your son about that - I&#39;m sure <br/>\nhe&#39;s noticed! so be open with him. Apologise as needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlan ahead. If you know you&#39;re going to have lunch with your mom, <br/>\nfor example, plan to spend the rest of the day doing something that <br/>\n*doesn&#39;t* lead you down that path of least resistance - maybe <br/>\nschedule that lunch for a day when your ds is having a sleepover at <br/>\na friend&#39;s house or something so you can have the evening to shift <br/>\ngears. Or plan to do something with him where you mostly watch... go <br/>\nto a playground or skatepark or something like that. Make a concious <br/>\neffort to plan and schedule time with your mom *around* your kid, <br/>\nnot vice versa, so *you* have time to find your best self again. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Inflicting opinions/baggage","postDate":"1222182732","msgId":36162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTIzMDgxMm8zOTVlMDhlOXViMjRjYzU5NDZjMGNmNzU2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdiOWtuZytyYjN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdiOWtuZytyYjN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36159,"nextInTopic":36169,"prevInTime":36161,"nextInTime":36163,"topicId":36159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well it looks to me that you already know what to do.  :)  Spend your time away from negative influences, whether that s people or thoughts.
