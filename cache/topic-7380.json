Become a member of your local kennel club, find a breed you love, hook up with a reputable show breeder, start showing in juniors, and offer to do grunt work for a top handler. You learn SOO much in the sport!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=--<br/>\n  Maybe Kelly has some other great ideas.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n <br/>\nYeah--- I did. damn this computer! I&#39;ll see whether I can add anything before it spits everything back at me again! <br/>\n <br/>\nI would add that house/pet-sitting is a great way to get your foot in the door. So is pooper scooping! And a great way to make $$ even at so young an age!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy garage groom room is tiny! Just big enough for a raised tub (a MUST!) and a table. You don&#39;t want a big area---smaller&#39;s better---you don&#39;t want to be carrying a sopping wet collie ten feet from the tub to the table; a pivot is better! I keep my crates outside my room. <br/>\n <br/>\nBuy high quality equipment. It makes the job sooo much easier!<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n  Also you do not need to be certified a groomer. Many groomers who went to <br/>\ngrooming school ( I used to train groomers for PetSmart) are not good and others <br/>\nwho never had classes are the best ( Does that surprise any Unschooler???)<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nRight! <br/>\n <br/>\nMany people are trying to require licensure for groomers. I think that&#39;s just to cut down on competition and to make $$ for all the schools that are popping up around the country. Folks like me (with no schoolin&#39;) would be grandfathered in, so they say.  I learned by doing---by listening to my clients, by talking with handlers and breeders and by putting my hands on as many GOOD dogs as possible.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou can be certified as a master groomer by a couple of different organizations by taking a written test and then grooming four dogs in front of them. And you can be certified in *just* terriers, sporting, or nonsporting breeds---again by grooming dogs in front of someone who&#39;s certified to give you certification! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSome schools will hand out certificates of completion of the course---that&#39;s NOT the same thing! Although some people have tried to pass it off as such! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  The best groomers in my opinion start out just loving and wanting to know more <br/>\nabout dogs your dds and started by helping someone knowledgeable who they <br/>\nlearned from .

NO ONE GO OUT AND USE DISH DETERGENT ON YOUT PET!  Alex is right: it can and often *does* burn the tender skin of dogs. ALso don&#39;t use human shampoo---we have a different pH, and it can burn their skin too.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n  Also I completely agree about the diet. Diet is a the big culprit of 95% of <br/>\nall dogs skin allergies, odor, itchy skim, etc. It is so bad many veterinarians <br/>\njust put those dogs on corticoids( sp?) and just treat the symptoms when all <br/>\nthey need is a better diet.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nBingo! Plus---handstripping of terriers (combined with diet) can eliminate skin & coat problems like magic.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWere you a junior handler? I was---started at 12, and I judge juniors now. I don&#39;t show much right now (just my standard schnauzer clients a couple of times)---we have a 12 year old rescue German shepherd dog, a drop-dead gorgeous beagle with a gay tail, and a guide dog viszla puppy (who leaves in 3.5 weeks!). I&#39;m qualified to judge Weimaraners and viszlak, but I haven&#39;t applied to judge them yet. Maybe never will. Hard to say.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat do you show?

Dogs have a lot of natural oils that hold in odor. (Keep in mind that they are predators/scavengers and holding odors is considered a (good* thing! &lt;g&gt;) If you can get a forced air dryer and make sure he&#39;s dry TO THE SKIN, he won&#39;t stink as soon as usual.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n She flips over to the &quot;Grooming&quot;<br/>\nsection of her book and reads.  Well low and behold<br/>\nshe comes to a section about anal blockage and how a<br/>\ndog will scoot his bottom on the floor and lick their<br/>\nanal area regularly and that the dog will smell. <br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=--=<br/>\n <br/>\nOR...he has anal glands that are irritating him. These are like the scent glands on a skunk. Normally, they are expressed naturally when he moves his bowels (but the processed foods we use don&#39;t help the situation naturally! &lt;G&gt;). They are little tear-shaped glands located at about 4:30 and 7:30 under his rectum. They can be expressed manually from the inside or the outside. Most dogs HATE internal expressing--and that should be left to a vet, but most tolerate external expressing just fine. You just push the glands up and in: a liquid or sometimes a paste comes out the rectum.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThe books gives detailed instructions about how to remove<br/>\nthe blockage from the dogs anus.  She wants to give<br/>\nVince a full &quot;veterinary exam&quot; :-), but says that the<br/>\nanal blockage removal will have to be done by mom or<br/>\ndad!....LOL  I don&#39;t know guys, I have a very weak<br/>\nstomache.  <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d have a vet show her how to do it correctly---or show YOU! &lt;G&gt; The worst thing is the stench that it produces---and if you&#39;re not IN the tub with a ready water source or using a paper towel that you can throw away asap (and the wash your hands even faster!), it *can* spray an amazing distance, and the stink can stick on you for a long, long time! <br/>\n <br/>\nKeep in mind that this is a GLAND!!!! Just like mammary glands, the more it is expressed, the more it will *need* to be expressed. I always *check*  to see whether a gland is infected or impacted, but I don&#39;t express every gland that walks in! I just *check* manually, expressing a *tiny* bit to see.<br/>\n <br/>\nSoemtimes a dog will express them under duress---dog fights, extreme fear, other things will cause a dog to express them automatically. The stench is unmistakable! &lt;G&gt; Every dog is diferent: some need the expressed, some don&#39;t, some need them removed!<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s not something everyone would choose to do, but remember: I scrub dogs&#39; butts for a living! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129294861,"authorName":"christy_imnotred","from":"&quot;christy_imnotred&quot; &lt;christy_imnotred@...&gt;","profile":"christy_imnotred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Oh NO!!!","postDate":"1130948206","msgId":7419,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrYW9wZStncGp0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUxMTAxMTkxNTA2Ljc0NTY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzMDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7383,"nextInTopic":7423,"prevInTime":7418,"nextInTime":7420,"topicId":7380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
