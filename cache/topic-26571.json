If she wants to go  <br/>\nto school for social reasons, that&#39;s as valid as for academic. But I  <br/>\nthink Sandra covers that fairly well in her essay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; when he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get his way<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It will be hugely helpful when looking at the problem he&#39;s having to  <br/>\nsee this as &quot;when he doesn&#39;t get his needs met&quot; or &quot;when he can&#39;t get  <br/>\nhis point across&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is ignoring the right thing to do<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you were so supremely frustrated because people weren&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstanding you that you had to drop to the floor to scream out  <br/>\nyour frustration, would you want people to ignore you?<br/>\n<br/>\n(It depends on the child, of course and depends on what triggers it.  <br/>\nThe point is don&#39;t ask us. Look at your child and figure out what  <br/>\n*he* wants you to do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it always sounds rude, but the mindful parenting approach is to  <br/>\nbecome more aware to tend to the child before the tantrum hits.  <br/>\nAnticipate his needs. Is he too hot or cold? Is he running low on  <br/>\nfuel? Is he tired? Has he been sitting to long?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t, of course, always do that. Sometimes *they* don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s wrong, but the focus is in being more aware to minimize the  <br/>\nmeltdowns. The fewer meltdowns he has, the more he feels you &#39;re  <br/>\ndoing your best to meet his needs, the more forgiving he&#39;ll be when  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t. (Though it might be much to expect of a 19 mo. It *will*  <br/>\ncome.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also be his age.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut try to think in terms of &quot;Yes&quot;. Which doesn&#39;t always mean &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>\ndrop this right now and do that.&quot; It means, &quot;I&#39;m taking your request  <br/>\nseriously but there&#39;s a few obstacles in my way.&quot; So you can say  <br/>\n&quot;Yes, let&#39;s get our umbrellas and go out.&quot; (But really, weren&#39;t kids  <br/>\nmade to get wet?) &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be done with the dishes in 10 minutes.  <br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to keep me company the time will seem to go faster.&quot;  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a post I wrote &quot;Always say yes&quot; that&#39;s here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/changing%20parenting/alwayssayyes.html\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/changing%20parenting/alwayssayyes.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s just the tip of possibilities. The question has come up a lot  <br/>\nand it might be worth going through the archives for other responses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another super big flaw of mine is that I just blow up rather easy...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of anger is about lack of control. It&#39;s natural to get upset  <br/>\nwhen the world isn&#39;t working the way we want it to. So a lot of it is  <br/>\nmentally shifting to the idea that the world isn&#39;t in our control. It  <br/>\nbecomes pointless to be angry at the rain when we know there isn&#39;t  <br/>\nanything we can do to make it stop! :-) And that feeling can extend  <br/>\nto other parts of life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can *affect* the world by our actions but we can&#39;t *control* it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften it&#39;s also about expectations (which is related). When we expect  <br/>\nthe world to do one thing, or expect another person to behave in one  <br/>\nway and they don&#39;t then it&#39;s frustrating. So dropping expectations is  <br/>\nanother mental shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat makes it sound simple, but of course it isn&#39;t! It does take a  <br/>\ndetermination to change and it&#39;s easy to slip back into old ways.  <br/>\nFocusing on the person you want to be helps a lot. Pam Sorooshian  <br/>\ntalks about giving yourself two choices and then choosing the better  <br/>\none. Rather than trying to become perfect, just work on being better  <br/>\nand better. You&#39;ll have setbacks but focus on making the next moment  <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: You don&#39;t make them do anything??/Meredith","postDate":"1191346331","msgId":26641,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkdHZhcitlYnJwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZkdGwzMitpYTViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26640,"nextInTopic":26642,"prevInTime":26640,"nextInTime":26642,"topicId":26571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m going to answer your questions in reverse order bc the little- ... a ... sure ... so ...

Some kids are more easily frustrated.

If <br/>\nyou can prevent more of these situations (the whole paying attention <br/>\nthing only moreso) that will be good all &#39;round. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of preventing those kinds of situations involves thinking out <br/>\nof the box. Its raining but we can put some boots on. Its getting <br/>\ndark so lets get a flashlight. The store&#39;s not open yet, but we can <br/>\ndo something fun while we wait. Some of the thinking out of the box <br/>\ninvolves flat-out asking yourself &quot;why the heck not?&quot; and realizing <br/>\nthat the only reason why is that your mom never let you do it when <br/>\nyou were small. Oops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the only answer really is &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s just <br/>\nnot possible&quot;. Mom can&#39;t make it stop raining, can&#39;t keep the sun <br/>\nfrom going down, can&#39;t put the milk back in the broken glass. And <br/>\nsometimes a child needs some time to react to those impossibilities <br/>\nwithout mom trying to stop the crying or fix the unfixable. <br/>\nDepending on the child, he may need a hug, or a few words of shared <br/>\nsadness, or something safe to hit, or a quiet, safe space where he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to look at any other person. Figuring out what a child <br/>\nneeds in those moments takes a certain amount of trial and error, <br/>\nbut even when nothing seems to be working you can keep saying &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nsorry&quot; - or some other expression of shared disappointment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another super big flaw of mine is that I just blow up rather <br/>\n </span></blockquote>easy... <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have corrected this in the past and know that some of the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>excuses i <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; give for it is stress over money, decisions, lack of sleep, (I do <br/>\n&gt; take zoloft that helps curb the stress factor)  etc but there just <br/>\n&gt; excuses it isn&#39;t my kids fault...  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its important to take care of your own needs as much as possible so <br/>\nthat you have the reserves you need to handle issues that come up <br/>\nunexpectedly.

Keep in mind that when your reserves are &quot;topped up&quot; <br/>\nis when you get to practice the skills you need to cope better when <br/>\nyou&#39;re running on empty. And the bad blow-ups are at least a place <br/>\nto consider what you might have done better and maybe learn <br/>\nsomething - and a time when you get to practice appologising to your <br/>\nkids. That&#39;s an imporatnt skill, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;    The 14 year old came home with a progress report from earth <br/>\n&gt; science stating she had missed at least 3 homework assignments and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; holding a c in the class. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;m probably going to say the most radical thing you&#39;ve ever <br/>\nheard anyone say about homework, so brace yourself really hard - <br/>\nready? Do it for her. I&#39;m totally serious. If she&#39;s missing <br/>\nasignments and still passing the course, then the homework isn&#39;t <br/>\nhelping her learn the material anyway - if the homework didn&#39;t count <br/>\n*against* her, she&#39;d be getting a better grade.

Otoh, if you were doing her homework for <br/>\nher, you&#39;d have some time together in the evenings (she&#39;ll probably <br/>\nneed to copy it out in her own handwriting) and she&#39;ll feel <br/>\nsupported and grateful, rather than pissy. She&#39;ll learn that she can <br/>\ndepend on you to help her out if she needs it, without giving her <br/>\ncrap. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; her dad has state that he doesn&#39;t need her to have all a&#39;s just <br/>\n&gt; as long as she&#39;s trying.(not doing homework is not trying)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From her perspective, doing homework *isn&#39;t* trying, its a useless <br/>\nwaste of her time.

Here&#39;s my scoop <br/>\nmy friend hooked me up with this group about 2 years ago when I was <br/>\nhaving difficulty with my child (or should I say I was having <br/>\ndifficulties with how to be a consensual/mindful parent-- wasn&#39;t at <br/>\nall up to that point).  Anyway, I checked out this sight and the <br/>\nlight bulbs came on..I started working on some of the approaches <br/>\nsuggested in our discussions.  However, since than I&#39;ve gotten busy <br/>\n(aren&#39;t we all) and have been slipping into old patterns.  Like <br/>\ndemanding, yelling, etc.  Thanks to the above subject (you don&#39;t make <br/>\nthem do anything?) Joanne happen to put something into perspect  --- <br/>\nand that is to in general or overall if we work on respecting each <br/>\nothers wishes, respecting a NO response, and finding mutual <br/>\nagreements -- argueing and fighting will lessen.,...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with that here are some questions for all of you&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;ll tell you a bit about myself: I&#39;m basically a single <br/>\nparent, I know have a boyfriend that lives with me and we are working <br/>\non a partnership....  anyway I have a 5 year old boy, Ian  who has <br/>\nbenefitted tremendously when I have implemented mindful parenting, a <br/>\n19 month old son who I haven&#39;t been implementing the best tactics and <br/>\nneed some help with, and now a 14 year old &quot;step-daughter&quot; who I try <br/>\nto implement mindful parenting but kind of battle the dad with his <br/>\ndemanding, old fashioned I can say &quot;no&quot; because I&#39;m the parent and I <br/>\nknow best attitude (which I often slip into also -- old patterns are <br/>\ntruly hard to break).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly,  I am not an unschooler completely because both my 5 year <br/>\nold and 14 year old go to school.  I chose for my 5 year old to go <br/>\nbecause he really wanted to go plus I work.  and I and her dad have <br/>\ngiven the 14 year old a choice to home school but she want to go to <br/>\nschool still.  sooo....<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I value the thoughts of unschooler because the parenting <br/>\nideals can be applied no matter what and thus far you folks are about <br/>\nthe only ones that I feel &quot;right&quot; with their thoughts on parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nsoooo.... here&#39;s a scenerio that has occured and I would love some <br/>\ninput on how unschoolers would have responded.<br/>\n   The 14 year old came home with a progress report from earth <br/>\nscience stating she had missed at least 3 homework assignments and is <br/>\nholding a c in the class.  Now her dad and I took away her going to <br/>\ngames (soccer and football) until her grade came up and homework was <br/>\nbeing done.... <br/>\n    her response:  pissy for a week, kept herself in her room, tried <br/>\nto keep talking dad to let her go to games, attitude in general, <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really help around house at all (dad&#39;s a truck driver -- when <br/>\nhe&#39;s gone she is usually very helpful to me -- helps keep the house <br/>\nup, babysits the boys, and rarely gives me an attitude ) Now before <br/>\nher dad left for another trip I asked if we should come to a happy <br/>\ncompromise so she could go to games but for any missed homework or <br/>\nc&#39;s on report card she would miss a game per... now I know <br/>\nunschoolers don&#39;t have to deal with grades which I wish I didn&#39;t have <br/>\nto either but I feel like because this is where were at we need to <br/>\nkeep encouraging her to keep up with school.  Now let me back track <br/>\njust a little, when I looked at her progress report when she did her <br/>\nhomework she usually recieved all the points -- so from that I glean <br/>\nthat she is can do the homework just chose not to...  And at the same <br/>\ntime her dad has state that he doesn&#39;t need her to have all a&#39;s just <br/>\nas long as she&#39;s trying.(not doing homework is not trying)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOk here&#39;s another scenerio with my 19 month old.   when he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nget his way or we just don&#39;t understand what he wants he has quite a <br/>\nfit... screaming at top of his lungs hitting, etc.  I&#39;m not even sure <br/>\nhow to respond ... i try to side track, I&#39;ve yelled (oops that&#39;s so <br/>\nwrong I know that I&#39;m just encouraging what he&#39;s already doing) I&#39;ve <br/>\neven spanked -- another no -no but old habit  -- I even hate it.... <br/>\nbut sometimes it just sets me into another world --- however, since <br/>\nI&#39;ve been making myself pay attention again,  I&#39;m trying to just <br/>\nremain calm and even ignore it ... Is ignoring the right thing to do -<br/>\n- I&#39;m thinking if I just ignore it he&#39;ll know it isn&#39;t working..(why <br/>\nis it I feel like a new mom half the time??)  anyway,  some of things <br/>\nwe &quot;fight&quot; over :  he wants to go outside and it&#39;s too wet or I&#39;m <br/>\njust not ready to go out yet  or both,  Yesterday, he wanted <br/>\nsomething done with his rocking horse and I just didn&#39;t know what?? <br/>\nwent for a walk and he didn&#39;t want to but the rest of us were --- <br/>\nforgot stroller... tried to just have him let me rest a little -- at <br/>\nthe end of the walk he finally was willing to walk --- what did he <br/>\njust see the car and know it was almost over:)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother flaw of mine is that I swear.  Now in my eyes casual swear <br/>\nwords here and there are no big deal --=-  but when I swear at the <br/>\nkids it&#39;s just not right sounds super harsh  --any suggestions how to <br/>\ncorrect this --- <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother super big flaw of mine is that I just blow up rather easy... <br/>\nI have corrected this in the past and know that some of the excuses i <br/>\ngive for it is stress over money, decisions, lack of sleep, (I do <br/>\ntake zoloft that helps curb the stress factor)  etc but there just <br/>\nexcuses it isn&#39;t my kids fault...  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there it is my candid thoughts and questions I look forward to <br/>\nyour thoughts ...</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:handling conflict was You don&#39;t make them","postDate":"1191335172","msgId":26637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkdGtlNCthYWkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcxMDAxMTQ0MHEzOTM4YjBlMmgyMDg1NmEzYjc5ODYzZTFlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26634,"nextInTopic":26638,"prevInTime":26636,"nextInTime":26638,"topicId":26571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... comes as it ...

What&#39;s leading up to this? Is the older <br/>\nguy feeling put-upon? Crowded? Bored? Needing some quiet? Needing <br/>\nsome attention? Those are all possible triggers for lashing out at <br/>\nsomeone. That&#39;s not an excuse, its a clue to mom that she needs to <br/>\nbe more involved and proactive in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe mom needs to hang out more when the brothers are in the same <br/>\nroom together - that&#39;s something I had to do a Lot of for Months <br/>\nafter Ray came to live with us, in part bc he had all <br/>\nthese &quot;schoolyard&quot; behaviors that really weren&#39;t great ways to <br/>\nrelate to a smaller, younger kid. Nowadays I *still* expect to have <br/>\nto hang out more if the kids have been separated for a week or more -<br/>\n like when Ray went to visit his grandma, or Mo and I went to L&L. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe mom needs to look at what kinds of expectations she has for <br/>\nthe boys based on their ages. I know *I* need to remind myself on a <br/>\nregular basis that 14 is still pretty young - especially since the <br/>\n14yo in question is six feet (almost 2m) tall! Its easy to look at <br/>\ntwo children and see one as being soooo much bigger and older and <br/>\nhave unrealistic expectations as a result. Its a really common <br/>\npitfall - and one of the sources of resentment and corespondingly <br/>\nugly behavior on the part of older kids. The behavior is saying &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nin over my head mom! Help!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBe sure you&#39;re still giving your oldest kid (he&#39;s 11, right?) lots <br/>\nof love and attention and support. He needs that to help him heal <br/>\nfrom school and to get back in touch with who he really is as a <br/>\nperson. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling has become<br/>\n&gt; &quot;child-kings&quot; and that is abdication of parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope you can see from the above that what I&#39;m advocating is not an <br/>\nabdication of parenting, but More parenting for All your kids. Kids <br/>\nin school are shoved into a greater degree of independence than is <br/>\nreally healthy for them. Your kids need some time to be a little <br/>\nmore needy so that they can start to develop some trust in You as <br/>\ntheir support system. They don&#39;t have that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I am talking about are those things<br/>\n&gt; that we all must do in life to get along and get by.

Not to feed the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>selfish<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parts of us all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;m reading this as a statement of personal values (or in <br/>\nunschooling jargon &quot;principles&quot;). One of the troubles I&#39;m seeing is <br/>\nthat they&#39;re all starting with the word &quot;not&quot; - that&#39;s important. <br/>\nKnowing what you want to avoid in life doesn&#39;t necessarily help you <br/>\nmove Toward anything. How could you re-think these ideas in a more <br/>\npositive way? Generosity, perhaps? Then think about how you can <br/>\nencourage generosity in your home - first by modelling it yourself, <br/>\nand then by helping your kids find ways to be generous of one <br/>\nanother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see how you have to shift your thinking to do that? Its <br/>\nunlikely that anyone is going to feel generous towards a brother <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s always being asked to give things up - he&#39;s more likely to <br/>\nfeel put-upon. So how can you help your guys feel as though their <br/>\nlives are so Full - of love, care, time, grace, and joy - that they <br/>\ncan give those things away by the handful? More parenting. More <br/>\npresence and love and care and time and grace and joy From Mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Upon further reflection I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s OK for anyone to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>always<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; say no all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is why unchoolers work to Say Yes More! Moms and dads are often <br/>\nin the position of saying No over and over - not right now, stop it, <br/>\nyou can&#39;t have x until you do y, etc. Find ways to say Yes, yourself <br/>\nso your kids can see what a life full of possibilites looks like. <br/>\nYes you can have another. Yes, I&#39;m available right now. Yes, I&#39;m <br/>\nlistening. Yes, your thoughts and feeling and wants and wishes and <br/>\nhopes and dreams are important to me. Yes, I love you with all my <br/>\nheart.

(Not all kids are born with that.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) some kids, because they fear being out of shape, will force  <br/>\nthemselves to exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) some kids who would have enjoyed some kind of physical activity  <br/>\nwill be so turned off by being made to exercise, be turned off by the  <br/>\nnegative associations they&#39;ve had with activity, that they&#39;ll rebel  <br/>\nand do the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) some kids who aren&#39;t drawn to physical activity, but who might  <br/>\nhave found something they enjoy, will avoid it just because they have  <br/>\nnegative associations with it and can finally avoid it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the only solution then to let them be? No. And if you assume that  <br/>\nmust be so, then the answers won&#39;t make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Unschoolers* goal is to be our children&#39;s partners not their  <br/>\nmasters. Kids *do* want to be healthy. But they, like all humans,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want someone to force them to go through the motions of doing  <br/>\nsomething that someone else thinks will make them healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do unschoolers do instead?<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of exercising we do active things and invite the kids to  <br/>\njoin. Yes, they can say no, but when we&#39;re offering things they enjoy  <br/>\n(and actively seeking out new things to find things they enjoy), they  <br/>\nwon&#39;t say no often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe offers can be bike rides, walks through the woods, climbing  <br/>\nrocks, rock wall climbing, sports teams, swimming, horseback riding  <br/>\nand so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is 30 minutes of exercise per day then unschooling won&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp you achieve that any more than it will help some parent achieve  <br/>\n30 minutes of math a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is kids who appreciate the wide variety of ways they can  <br/>\nkeep active, who have pleasant associations with being active, then  <br/>\nwe can help you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All responses seem to point to the parents learning to live<br/>\n&gt; around these things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you filter the responses through the idea that either kids get  <br/>\ntheir way or adults get their way then the answers are going to sound  <br/>\nlike we&#39;re saying kids get their way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a *third* option. The third option is finding a way for  <br/>\neveryone to get their needs met. It&#39;s seeing children&#39;s needs not as  <br/>\nmore important but as just as important as adult needs. It *does*  <br/>\ntake more work but it doesn&#39;t have the downsides of force.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conventional route is for the parent to decide on a solution and  <br/>\nimpose the solution on the child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mindful parenting route is to step back and see the big picture.  <br/>\nHow can I help my child get what he wants *and* get what I want? How  <br/>\ncan I model how to solve problems when two needs seem to clash?<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly all of us were raised by parents who modeled for us that the  <br/>\nway to get our needs met is to be bigger and make the other person do  <br/>\nwhat we want. That&#39;s why most people have problems understanding that  <br/>\na problem *doesn&#39;t* need to be one person winning and the other losing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about winning and losing. It&#39;s not about making someone else  <br/>\ngive up some of what they have so another person can get what they  <br/>\nwant. It&#39;s about seeing solutions where everyone&#39;s needs are met and  <br/>\nno one loses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means seeing beyond the immediate problem. The child with the  <br/>\nLegos doesn&#39;t want them all over the house. That&#39;s just the solution  <br/>\nhe&#39;s hit on to preserve them. He needs help, not force. If mom comes  <br/>\nswooping in and sees his solution as the problem and tries to  <br/>\neliminate his solution he&#39;s going to hang onto it! It&#39;s the only way  <br/>\nhe sees to get what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution is to help him figure out what he *really* wants. (His  <br/>\ncreations preserved apparently.) The solution is to respectfully help  <br/>\nhim find solutions where everyone&#39;s needs are met.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children&#39;s wants and needs and desires are treated with respect  <br/>\nas though they mattered to us, then they will (as they&#39;re able) treat  <br/>\nour wants and needs and desires with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the child&#39;s creations are swept away in order for mom to meet her  <br/>\nneeds, what problem solving method has the mom modeled for him? That  <br/>\nmight makes right? That being big is better than being small? That  <br/>\nmaking someone do what you want them to is the best way to get your  <br/>\nneeds met? That when he is able to sweep someone else&#39;s bothersome  <br/>\nneed out of the way that he should do so?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what&#39;s the child&#39;s likely reaction? We *want* it to be &quot;Oh, yeah,  <br/>\nI was being rude. Mom&#39;s right.&quot; How often *is* that your reaction  <br/>\nwhen someone has trampled all over your needs? Kids are no different.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re going to be angry. They&#39;re going to feel like they aren&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstood and that the only person who cares about their needs is  <br/>\nthemselves so they&#39;d better fight to hold onto what they have or it&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing to be taken away by force.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the mom treats the child&#39;s need to keep his Lego creations with  <br/>\nrespect, she&#39;s modeling respect. When the situation is not treated  <br/>\nlike there needs to be losers for there to be winners, there&#39;s no  <br/>\nneed for kids to fight to hold onto what  they have. They *will* give  <br/>\nwhen they know mom keeps their needs at the top of her priority list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That my insistance on doing some for my health<br/>\n&gt; and theirs will envitably lead to them hating it...ergo against the<br/>\n&gt; philosophy.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The goal is peaceful joyful family lives not living by the rule of  <br/>\nthe philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nChild-kings are not joyful.

It&#39;s a route to  <br/>\npartners.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can drop the idea that we&#39;re advocating child rule, if you can  <br/>\nsee that we&#39;re trying to *model* cooperative living (not *impose*  <br/>\ncooperative living solutions which is just back to force) and *model*  <br/>\nproblem solving that takes *everyone&#39;s* feelings into consideration  <br/>\nthen the answers will make a lot more sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; No Joyce, not direct<br/>\n&gt; quotes but that&#39;s the gist of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Direct quotes will help the conversation become helpful because you  <br/>\nare taking in the words and their meaning is changing inside of you  <br/>\nso you think -- *insisting* -- we&#39;re saying something we&#39;re not. So,  <br/>\nplease, direct quotes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At NO time did I ever say my vision was better than yours.

You are telling us what it&#39;s like in  <br/>\nour homes: that we have child kings, that we are slaves to the   <br/>\nphilosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are saying, no, you&#39;re misunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, no, I&#39;m right. I got the gist of it. Here&#39;s what is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see how your telling us what is true in our own homes could  <br/>\nmake having a discussion really difficult?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do not insist, force, coerce nor even ask a child to do<br/>\n&gt; anything because that is against the philosophy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See, how many times does it need repeated, that isn&#39;t what we&#39;re saying?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, instead of letting go of that idea, you keep reading what people  <br/>\nare saying and forcing it  into that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone once said, to understand a new idea you need to empty your  <br/>\ncup first. You need to let go of what you *think* we&#39;re saying. You  <br/>\nneed to let go of the filters that are sorting the answers into  <br/>\n&quot;Child gets his way&quot; and &quot;Parent gets her way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t saying either and until you can see that there&#39;s *other*  <br/>\noptions, the answers just won&#39;t  make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I am told that children should not be asked to do chores, to clean<br/>\n&gt; their rooms, to exercise, or in any other way help the family, then I<br/>\n&gt; have to assume this is rule by children.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*DON&#39;T* assume. *Ask.* Please! Because you&#39;re guesses are wrong and  <br/>\nthat&#39;s why the answers aren&#39;t making sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is having children help today, there isn&#39;t a way of  <br/>\ndoing that other than by force.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is long term in having children who help you because  <br/>\nthey want to help you, then we can help with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s more accurate to say the goal for mindful parents isn&#39;t  <br/>\nto throw out solutions because they&#39;re disrespectful. The goal is to  <br/>\nfind respectful solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first goal would leave us with no way of handling problems! The  <br/>\nsecond is action oriented towards the goal of respect and great  <br/>\nrelationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I understand that you probably grow tired of answering the same<br/>\n&gt; questions over and over again<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually not. I&#39;ve been doing this for 12 years answering the same  <br/>\nquestions hundreds of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s tiring is people reading what gets written and misinterpreting  <br/>\nit and *then* saying &quot;My interpretation of what&#39;s happening in your  <br/>\nhomes is right. How could I possibly interpret it any way other than  <br/>\nI am? So, how can you possibly live like that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it goes round and round with people saying &quot;No, you&#39;re  <br/>\nmisinterpreting.&quot; and being responded with, &quot;How can I be  <br/>\nmisinterpreting? You *are* saying that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s truly maddening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only benefit is that the responses clarify points for *other*  <br/>\npeople who are reading. Several people are probably saying &quot;Oh, I get  <br/>\nit now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &gt; The question still stands: If you ask your child to do  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; something, can<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the child say no and you&#39;ll be okay with that?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nothing about always say no. It&#39;s just common courtesy that when  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; you<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ask someone to do you a favor, you need to be okay with no.

We have a guiding principle - everyone  <br/>\ndeserves to be safe in their own house. If older brother is being  <br/>\nmean because he&#39;s tired and hungry, I&#39;d probably say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go  <br/>\nget some food.&quot; If the younger one has been irritating him for a  <br/>\nwhile, I might distract the younger one in some way so that older  <br/>\nbrother can have some space from him.

Maybe I&#39;ve been too busy elsewhere and they need me to  <br/>\nread them both a good story or cuddle up on the couch with some  <br/>\npopcorn and watch a movie.

I feel that way, not as  <br/>\noften as I used to, because I&#39;m so blessed to have this struggle to  <br/>\nsave my own children from it. One thing I had to ask myself is &quot;Did I  <br/>\nhave an unschooling background where I was making choices, or was my  <br/>\nfood and exercise legislated? Which one led to me being overweight?&quot;  <br/>\nI can assure you it wasn&#39;t freedom of choice. That&#39;s one reason why  <br/>\nit is very important to *me* for my kids to choose these things of  <br/>\ntheir own free will, because I still remember the first year, living  <br/>\non my own, I was still skinny, but I was choosing all that junk food  <br/>\nthat I either was not allowed to have, or had to have stipulations  <br/>\nattached. I stopped exercising because before then it was always  <br/>\nlegislated by school, or by mom (get out and do something, anything!)  <br/>\nso suddenly I could sit and watch Maury all day, eating my dang  <br/>\ntwinkies, the whole box if I wanted. ack! How long did it take me to  <br/>\ngain all that weight? Not long at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started unschooling two years ago. The first day my son had the  <br/>\nWii, he spent 14 hours on it. I didn&#39;t even keep track, i didn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto know (he showed me later how to find the tracker on the  <br/>\ngamesystem....omg) But by six months later, there were several days  <br/>\nin a row that it wasn&#39;t even turned on. What were they doing? Oh,  <br/>\nsome of it was playing on the internet, but some of it was spent  <br/>\nbuilding a tree house, or hiking with the scouts, or digging up the  <br/>\npotatoes. My son, whom I worried over because he&#39;s such a bookworm,  <br/>\nhas spent two or three hours every day this past week trying to beat  <br/>\nout his own score on the pogo stick. Talk about exercise! I really  <br/>\nthink that once the TV and videogames get their fill, when the kids  <br/>\nhonestly and truly believe that they can come and go from them  <br/>\nwithout stipulation, then the ability to walk away and choose other  <br/>\nthings are much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read someone else&#39;s post about making an entire lifestyle change.  <br/>\nThat is huge. Being able to say, as a mom, I&#39;d like to spend time  <br/>\nwith you doing x or y, what do you think? and then YOU do it. If they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to go, don&#39;t make it an issue. You get out and have fun  <br/>\nand exercise and feel good. They&#39;ll join you when they are ready. My  <br/>\nfriend walks with her girls, they walk four miles a day...to a frozen  <br/>\ncustard stand! They have a good time talking, there&#39;s a reward at the  <br/>\nend, and they are building a routine with exercise. They don&#39;t go  <br/>\nevery day, but often enough that the girls don&#39;t mind missing if  <br/>\ntheir walk curves to go by the pond rather than to the shopping  <br/>\ncenter.

What is he getting  <br/>\nout of it? What does that older child need in order to stop? Instead  <br/>\nof just saying &quot;NO!&quot;, which just gets him to stop until you are out  <br/>\nof the scene (trust me, not only grew up with that, but also have  <br/>\nseen it in my own children) and builds resentment, what else can you  <br/>\nsay? Once you look at why the behavior is happening, then you can  <br/>\nlook at what will work to increase respect for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nViewing it as the older brother being &#39;an ass&#39; presents a lot of  <br/>\nnegative views of the child, and probably perpetuates that behavior.  <br/>\nSometimes the little brother is really asking for it ;-)  Seriously,  <br/>\nwhen my 12 yo is picking on a younger sibling, it&#39;s often because he  <br/>\nfeels out of control in a situation. We&#39;re driving somewhere and he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have anything else to do. All the computers are being used  <br/>\nand he&#39;s run out of library books. He&#39;s hungry and doesn&#39;t realize  <br/>\nhis blood sugar is low, so it is appealing to his chemistry. So i can  <br/>\noffer things. i can offer snacks to boost his energy and blood sugar.  <br/>\nI can offer his some books from my collection. In the car I will ask  <br/>\nhim to find a different radio station that he likes, or maybe we&#39;ll  <br/>\nput in on the news and discuss what&#39;s going on. I&#39;ll find something  <br/>\nthat&#39;s appealing to his 12 yo body and mind as being difficult, he  <br/>\npersonally enjoys the two mile hike to the grocery store, so I&#39;ll  <br/>\nmention that we&#39;re out of such-n-so and see if he wants to go. I have  <br/>\na mental checklist of things he likes to do, and I&#39;ll ask if he minds  <br/>\nclimbing into the attic and checking the vents for AC leaks, or  <br/>\ncutting up firewood, or digging through our old CDROMS to see which  <br/>\nones are compatible with our newest software. KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that you should tell your little one that he has to  <br/>\nput up with being teased, I have learned to step back and ask &quot;Hey!  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s going on in here?&quot; and listening and figuring out what&#39;s  <br/>\nREALLY going on. Beyond the conflict, what has really instigated  <br/>\nthis? Sometimes big brothers just need a break. can he stay home  <br/>\nwhile you take the younger ones shopping? Can you take him once a  <br/>\nweek out for an ice cream cone while someone watches the younger  <br/>\nkids. It really helps all of my kids to hear lots of stories of how  <br/>\nprecious they were when they were younger. Not as a &quot;You did this  <br/>\nwhen YOU were four, get over it.&quot; But all the time, outside of the  <br/>\nsituation. Driving to the mall, &quot;You know, I remember this one time,  <br/>\nwhen you were four, you did x, y, z.

I think the questions can be answered in many more ways than <br/>\njust yes or no. There is a lot to be said in between forcing and <br/>\ndoing nothing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, with the exercise question.  There are a lot of ways to <br/>\nencourage your child to be physically active.  People often use the <br/>\nexample of what if your spouse asked you to do what you ask your <br/>\nkids to do.  If my husband said, &quot;You need to get some exercise.  <br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you go for a bike ride for 30 minutes today?&quot;  I&#39;d most <br/>\nlikely want to respond with not just &quot;NO&quot; but &quot;Hell no! I can decide <br/>\nfor myself if I want some exercise.&quot;  However, if he said, &quot;I know <br/>\nwhat would be fun!  Let&#39;s go for a bike ride after I get home.  I <br/>\nknow a really cool place to ride.&quot;  Wow.  It sounds fun now.  But, I <br/>\ncould still say no and would say no if there was something that I <br/>\nwould much rather be doing or if I don&#39;t really like bike riding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this other part about rule by children or child-kings, I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand.  What do you mean by children ruling?  Ruling <br/>\nyou?  How?  Ruling themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am hearing from people here is that what children want is <br/>\nimportant too, not that what we as parents want is not important.  <br/>\nIt is generally accepted in our culture that the projects of <br/>\nchildren are not very important, and if a child leaves a lot of <br/>\nlegos on the floor, parents are fully justified in just scooping <br/>\nthem up to get them out of the way.  After all, it&#39;s just toys.  But <br/>\nto a child, destroying that lego project may be comparable to <br/>\nsomeone stomping on a painting you just finished or throwing a <br/>\nlovely meal you prepared into the trash.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe aren&#39;t saying do nothing and say nothing.  We are saying that <br/>\nwhat is important to you may not be important to your child.  We are <br/>\nsaying talk to your children if something is bothering you, and if <br/>\nit&#39;s important to you that they do something, ask yourself why and <br/>\nlet them know why.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t have time for more now but wish I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7644358,"authorName":"Kidgie@aol.com","from":"Kidgie@...","profile":"mama_de_julian_y_julia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: You don&#39;t make them do anything??/Meredith","postDate":"1191293101","msgId":26624,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkOC4xZDAwZWJhZS4zNDMzMGFhZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26623,"nextInTopic":26627,"prevInTime":26623,"nextInTime":26626,"topicId":26571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/1/2007 6:52:31 P.M.

Just in this thread.<br/>\n I asked about exercise and was told that my kids shouldn&#39;t be asked<br/>\nto do any.  They should be left to their own devices and they will<br/>\ncome to it naturally.  That my insistance on doing some for my health<br/>\nand theirs will envitably lead to them hating it...ergo against the<br/>\nphilosophy.  There is another thread here about some gigantic Lego<br/>\ncreations which the child has forbid the mother to remove, move, or<br/>\nalter.  All responses seem to point to the parents learning to live<br/>\naround these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked about that and did people really think children should be<br/>\nallowed to leave their stuff all over the house and was told that I<br/>\nhad monopolized my house with my stuff so the children should be<br/>\nallowed the same rights.  To expect otherwise is against the<br/>\nphilosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am told that children should not be asked to do chores, to clean<br/>\ntheir rooms, to exercise, or in any other way help the family, then I<br/>\nhave to assume this is rule by children.  What other assumption can<br/>\nthere be?  Some have said they ask but do not expect the children to<br/>\ndo any thing but usually they will when they get around to it.  But<br/>\nmost have told me to ask is to disrespect.  No Joyce, not direct<br/>\nquotes but that&#39;s the gist of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What people have written may sound that way but you are dead wrong.<br/>\n&gt; You will get far better answers if you ask questions about what&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; confusing you rather than insisting your vision of what&#39;s going on in<br/>\n&gt; our homes is better than our own vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n**At NO time did I ever say my vision was better than yours.  What you<br/>\ndo with your kids in your home is your business. I am asking what is<br/>\nbeing advocated.  It&#39;s a simple question.  What is the position of the<br/>\nphilosophy re: children and who says and does what when?  I also said,<br/>\nJoyce, that I read not just here but other places as well, and that my<br/>\ninformation is coming from multiple sources, BUT the overarching<br/>\nmessage is &quot;Do not insist, force, coerce nor even ask a child to do<br/>\nanything because that is against the philosophy.&quot;  So I asked...and<br/>\nwhile most people answered nicely, you have been less so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that you probably grow tired of answering the same<br/>\nquestions over and over again but if you didn&#39;t want to answer...you<br/>\ncould have just deleted my post.  I am simply trying to wrap my head<br/>\naround something that is foreign to me.  I *thought* I had a grasp of<br/>\nthe concept until it came to my attention that this is more than just<br/>\nabout learning it&#39;s is a part of all interactions with children.  This<br/>\nboggles my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW Joyce, I am a behaviorist and work with aggressive animals for a<br/>\nliving.  I understand behavior as communication.   I understand the 8<br/>\nways to change a behavior.  I understand and use opperant conditioning<br/>\nin my life daily.  I am not stupid nor am I incapable of grasping<br/>\nesoteric concepts.  I am familiar with &quot;bucking the system&quot; as I feed<br/>\nmy pets a biologically appropriate diet and they have minimal<br/>\ninterference with their immune systems.  So please do me the favor of<br/>\nnot being disrespectful or patronizing to me.  I am simply trying to<br/>\ngrasp the concept so it can be applied correctly.  What is wrong with<br/>\nthat?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The question still stands: If you ask your child to do something, can<br/>\n&gt; the child say no and you&#39;ll be okay with that?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Nothing about always say no. It&#39;s just common courtesy that when you<br/>\n&gt; ask someone to do you a favor, you need to be okay with no. If you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; not okay with no, then you aren&#39;t asking. You&#39;re disguising a command<br/>\n&gt; as a question. And if you don&#39;t see it as a favor you&#39;re asking, then<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve imposed an obligation on them and, again, it&#39;s not a question.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s just a command.<br/>\n<br/>\n**And this would be against the philosophy yes?  One must never give<br/>\ntheir child a command and only ask favors but be prepared for that<br/>\nfavor to be declined.  Is that what you are saying because that&#39;s the<br/>\nway it reads.  And so I look at that and see that child-kings.  If I&#39;m<br/>\nwrong and there is something other option then please enlighten me<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m trying to understand how this actually looks.

Children can be treated<br/>\nwith respect and kindness without given free-reign to impact the family and<br/>\nworld as they see fit regardless of age or motivation.  What I am struggling<br/>\nwith is what I see as parents giving up guiding children and allowing<br/>\nchildren to guide everything.

Are they willing to do the work?  Are you if the kids aren&#39;t? What kind of pets are we talking about and how old are your kids?  If you&#39;ve had the talk about pets and cleanliness -- and everyone is on the same page about what pet care requires, then is anyone being forced, or are you representing yourself unfairly?   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m making them get exercise.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *****<br/>\n&gt; again, how and to what gain?

And yes, there are days where if I didn&#39;t nudge them out the door, usually with me, they would sit doing nothing or just vegging in front of the computer or xbox. I am seeing the value of certain aspects to the<br/>\ngames they play on screen but gosh they need to be strong. They need to be healthy. I don&#39;t want them to fight with being fat as I have had to my whole life.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Did someone force you to exercise 30 minutes a day?  Are your kids overweight?  I come from a family of fat people.  I&#39;m overweight myself.  I have three children -- the oldest is stick-skinny no matter what he eats or how little he *exercises*; the middle child has always been a solid/heavy kid and he&#39;s learning better habits now at 11, and losing weight (without force, btw); the youngest is an all around healthy kid, a born athlete and a much more likely to eat a balanced diet than his brothers.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I grew up with all my meal portions controlled (no dessert once I was 13, as I was getting too *hippy*), we ate only Roman Meal bread (never white) and the only cereal we were allowed was Total (with only one spoon of sugar added); I was forced to participate in sports and get *regular exercise.* It benefited me and my sibs not at all -- we were the 20-somethings roaming the grocery store with a cartful of Cap&#39;n Crunch, Wonder bread and Coke.  I hated all *exercise* and still really don&#39;t enjoy sports.  All the controlling did was make me intent that when I was on my own, I&#39;d do (or not do) and eat (or not eat) exactly and ONLY what I WANTED -- that anything my parents told me I needed was suspect and to be avoided.  After all, they didn&#39;t trust me to make good choices, why should I listen to or trust them? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nIs your home *monopolized* with your stuff -- furniture you chose, artwork you like?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*** well yes and no. We live in a small space and I can not see how allowing one of them to drop some creation in the middle of the living room and it being sacrosanct and off limits to touch is a good thing.I have &quot;stuff&quot; too but it&#39;s not in the middle of the floor. Additionally, I have dogs and cats and will be bringing a 3 yr old home from China soon. Their things can&#39;t have more value than those of everyone else.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  But do their things have less value than your things? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If the space you live in is too small for dogs, cats, bedroom pets, your own current children, an incoming 3yo and two adults, then maybe it&#39;s time to re-negotiate how the family&#39;s space is being used.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLuggage?

Its possible to have <br/>\nrelationships with children that don&#39;t include bigger people forcing <br/>\nlittler people to do things. Its challenging and takes a Lot more in <br/>\nthe way of skills, but that&#39;s one of the reasons this and other <br/>\nunschooling boards exist - to help parents learn those skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of those skills are conceptual, as I mentioned in another post. <br/>\nLearning to understand behavior as communication is pretty <br/>\nconceptual, and takes a good deal of practice, but it can make a <br/>\nHuge difference in a family. It has in mine. Learning to think of <br/>\nkids as partners rather than unfinished products is also pretty <br/>\nconceptual - and one of the core principles of whole life <br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you all<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; seriously have child run households where what a kid wants <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trumps what the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; family wants and needs...and even to the detriment of the child?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, here&#39;s another - what my family wants and needs is based in <br/>\npart on what my kids want and need. A big part of my job involves <br/>\nvaluing my kids&#39; wants and needs and trying to help them get those <br/>\nmet - which is pretty tricky with a highly verbal, extroverted <br/>\nteenager *and* a highly visual, introverted 6yo. Part of the <br/>\nconcepual work of unschooling is believing that its possible for <br/>\nevery member of the family to feel honored and valued - and &quot;the <br/>\nfamily&quot; is honored and valued, too. Its not an either-or situation, <br/>\nits an &quot;and&quot; situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that helped me, early on, was thinking about my <br/>\nprinciples, or if you prefer, core values. And then thinking about <br/>\nhow I could live by those values - but not necessarily Impose them <br/>\non my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; We all have to do things we don&#39;t want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would you rather your kids did unpleasant things out of a sense of <br/>\nkindness and mutual support or duty? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve been forcing your kids to do things, rather than giving <br/>\nand asking and respecting and supporting, its likely that they do <br/>\nthose things grudgingly - which supports your &quot;need&quot; to force the <br/>\nissue. There isn&#39;t much basis on anyone&#39;s part to trust that family <br/>\nmembers can act out of generosity and thoughtfullness. Changing that <br/>\nsituation would have to begin with *more* generosity and <br/>\nthoughtfullness on your part. It would likely be a disaster if you <br/>\njust dropped all your &quot;have tos&quot; at once - but you *can* start <br/>\nsaying more &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll help&quot; and &quot;how can I make this easier on <br/>\nyou?&quot;. You can start showing *more* of the kindness you&#39;d like to <br/>\nsee in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m forcing my kids to keep their rooms clean.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t necessary to force them. You have a whole lot of other <br/>\noptions available. You can offer to help them clean. You can offer <br/>\nto clean the rooms for them (and I mean clean, not pitch all their <br/>\nstuff out of frustration). You can ask that they keep the doors <br/>\nshut. You can ask that they not bring food in there. You can <br/>\nacknowledge that keeping their rooms clean is your issue, not <br/>\ntheirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of my kids is a neat-freak by any stretch of the <br/>\nimagination, but in the last week both of them cleaned their rooms. <br/>\nOne asked for physical help, the other for suggestions. They don&#39;t <br/>\nclean their rooms every week - its not that important to either of <br/>\nthem - but they do periodically decide &quot;y&#39;know, my life would be <br/>\neasier if my room were picked up&quot; and voila! <br/>\n<br/>\nRight this moment, as I&#39;m typing, my stepson is washing dishes. Its <br/>\nsomething he&#39;s happy to do, but he rarely does it without being <br/>\nasked. So we ask. We try to ask when he&#39;s not obviously in the <br/>\nmiddle of something - and when we do, he&#39;s happy to do it right <br/>\nthen. Otherwise, he&#39;s likely to say &quot;when I&#39;m done/at a stopping <br/>\npoint&quot; - and since I&#39;d like him to be able to finish the things he <br/>\nstarts, I respect that. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeriodically one of my kids asks me to help with a project I&#39;m not <br/>\nthrilled about. If I&#39;m not in the middle of something more important <br/>\n(and there&#39;s not much in that category... cooking and peeing come to <br/>\nmind) I&#39;ll help out as best I can, because generosity and mutual <br/>\nsupport are important to me. That&#39;s what I mean by &quot;living my <br/>\nprinciples without imposing them&quot; - I can create a more generous <br/>\nfamily environment by Being more generous.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m making them get exercise. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, there are options besides force. Maybe you need to figure out <br/>\nhow to think outside the box a bit more in terms of helping them <br/>\nfind things they like to do that let them move their bodies. An <br/>\nexercise ball. A computer game that involves dancing. A floor-piano. <br/>\nA set of juggling clubs. A mini-trampoline. Stilts. A drum set.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t like exercising but it&#39;s good for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helps, from an unschooling perspective, to see *everything* you <br/>\ndo as a choice. You *choose* to exercise. You&#39;ve chosen a type of <br/>\nexercise you dislike for reasons that seem good to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow see that your children, also, have choices - right now maybe <br/>\ntheir choices are to do what mom wants or resist - can you give them <br/>\nMore Choices? Can you help them see the world in terms of options <br/>\nand possiblities rather than duties and limits? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t think I want a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; rule in my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who would? <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling tends to be a bit messier and less convenient in the <br/>\nshort run than telling kids what to do and when, but its a loooooong <br/>\nway away from &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. I&#39;m trying to help my kids <br/>\nunderstand their own needs and wants and motivations and not just <br/>\nreact to those. That looks really different between my two kids in <br/>\nsome ways, but both have an understanding that I&#39;m here as a <br/>\nresource for them, not an obstacle to get around or an authority to <br/>\ndefy. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] You don&#39;t make them do anything??","postDate":"1191259936","msgId":26587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUzQzFCODQ3LURBRUItNDMyQi04NERELUI1RjVCMEEzQUU2NUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcwOTMwMTUxMHY2MWRiZGRkMXFjYzZjMjVjNmQyNmE1NTMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcwOTMwMTUxMHY2MWRiZGRkMXFjYzZjMjVjNmQyNmE1NTMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26586,"nextInTopic":26588,"prevInTime":26586,"nextInTime":26588,"topicId":26571,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s strong language, but if it is true that  <br/>\nyou really truly do hate it, then you could hire someone to do it.  <br/>\nLots of people hire others to do their laundry. But, more  <br/>\nimportantly, can&#39;t you find joy in it, instead? I have grown to love  <br/>\nit by slowing down, paying closer attention, not viewing it as  <br/>\nsomething to just get done, but as a gift I give to my family and  <br/>\nmyself. Just like I might take care how I wrap a nice gift for  <br/>\nsomeone, I take good care of our clothing. We only buy things we  <br/>\nreally love. I enjoy taking care of them. My kids and husband do most  <br/>\nof their own laundry these days, and they have the same approach as I  <br/>\ndo, they&#39;re careful with their clothing.

I hated it for years and tried to force it on  <br/>\nmyself and I resisted my own attempts. But unschooling changed my  <br/>\nmentality and, eventually, that extended to believing that I matter  <br/>\nenough to take good care of myself. I started trying all kinds of  <br/>\nactivities and taking the time to go to nice places, the beach,  <br/>\npretty parks, etc., to go for walks. Now I run - yesterday I ran a  <br/>\n10K and I loved every minute of it. The joy of moving our bodies,  <br/>\nfeeling our muscles work - it is one of the greatest joys of life.  <br/>\nExercise for kids, especially, ought to come about as a result of  <br/>\nplay, which, by definition ought to be enjoyable. Find something else  <br/>\nto do - something you enjoy. You think you&#39;re modeling good habits,  <br/>\nbut what you&#39;re modeling is that things that are good for you are not  <br/>\nenjoyable. That&#39;s such a throwback to a Puritan ethic and a recipe  <br/>\nfor living a life filled with &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and &quot;should&#39;s.&quot; You don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to live that way, life can be filled, instead, with &quot;I love to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids, never forced to exercise, are all very physically active.  <br/>\nRoya hikes and rock climbs when possible, kayaks, swims several times  <br/>\nper week, and goes to a karate class twice a week.

That isn&#39;t how it works. But I can see why it appears that way,  <br/>\nespecially since you have the feeling that you have to do things you  <br/>\nhate. It would be hard to imagine that kids and adults can have  <br/>\ncompletely different attitudes than that. I can honestly say that I  <br/>\nnever do anything I hate and that even when I do things because I  <br/>\nfeel they need to be done, I do them knowing that it is my choice.  <br/>\nThat changes everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are more times that a parent supports a child&#39;s wants than that  <br/>\na child supports a parent&#39;s wants, for many years. But, that  <br/>\nnaturally begins to change as the kids get older.

They don&#39;t need  <br/>\nto &quot;exercise&quot; as in purposely run around a track or do sit-ups or  <br/>\nlift weights. They just need support in following their own natural  <br/>\ninclinations to be active in ways that give them pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s a real paradigm shift<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for me<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is - try pretending to yourself that it really works and giving it  <br/>\na real serious open-minded look. It isn&#39;t going to hurt, you don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to actually change anything, you can think it through even  <br/>\nthough it sounds risky.

I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want my kids thinking things like:<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is so mean. She doesn&#39;t understand. She doesn&#39;t care about MY  <br/>\nfeelings.
