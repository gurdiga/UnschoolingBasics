Its a qualitatively different way of connecting than via shared meals. Eating together is nice, and gives people a chance to connect on one level, but there&#39;s a separation in a meal situation between those who prepare the food and those who don&#39;t. Playing games together brings in the same sort of cameraderie that forms between people working together, in a way. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151979431,"authorName":"Rebecca McClure","from":"&quot;Rebecca McClure&quot; &lt;ackirebecci@...&gt;","profile":"ackirebecci","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Gaming Can Make a Better World TED Talk","postDate":"1269163979","msgId":43436,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvNHA0YitzMjF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1MTQ3Ny4xMTcwMi5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43426,"nextInTopic":43438,"prevInTime":43435,"nextInTime":43437,"topicId":43424,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
