I didn&#39;t think anything of it, didn&#39;t even track <br/>\nit because it was too difficult, with six kids playing, plus dh and I, who know how long <br/>\nanyone actually playing any game?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, when we got the Wii in December, there was again the upsurge in playing, and then <br/>\nthe decrease. The funny thing is yesterday Josh was drawing a chart. I thought that was a <br/>\nlittle odd, so I asked what was up, and he explained that the wii keeps track of your daily <br/>\nplaying, and he was charting it to see what it looked like. How funny! So the first day he <br/>\nhad it, between the lot of us, we played for SIXTEEN HOURS. That&#39;s pretty much every <br/>\nwaking hour of the day. Of course, some of us sleep later than others and stay up later <br/>\nthan others, however, it&#39;s still a lot of playing time. After about six weeks, it drops to six <br/>\nhours a day, which is less than an hour for each of us, approximately, taking into account <br/>\nthat we have only one wiimote and have to take turns playing. At eight weeks, Josh&#39;s <br/>\nbirthday occurred, he got three new games, and playing went up a little, but not a whole <br/>\nbunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it really emphasizes that novelty will increase playing time, and the longer you keep it a <br/>\nnovelty, the longer playing time will be. However!! I&#39;m not saying that you should drop <br/>\nlimitations with the hope of seeing a child decrease playing time, that&#39;s not the point at all. <br/>\n.Josh still plays the game system about four to five hours a day. He loves it, and it&#39;s fun, <br/>\nand it doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest if it&#39;s educational. I have friends who will only let their <br/>\nchildren do things that &#39;edify&#39; them. Well, that&#39;s great, but to be honest, *I* don&#39;t want to <br/>\nonly do things that make me a better person. I love surfing the web following a train of <br/>\nthought and reading snopes, I read lots of horror and scifi, which does nothing more for <br/>\nme than makes me happy. I have four or five hobbies that I only touch on rare occasions, <br/>\nand I don&#39;t even consider it &#39;quitting&#39; when I set it aside, I&#39;m &#39;saving it&#39; for when I&#39;m in the <br/>\nmood.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22301,"nextTopicId":22299}}
