The eldest is 20 & at university having gone through","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-511496069\">Hi there,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re very new to HS - started at the beginning of this yr. I have 4<br/>\nboys, 3 of which I am hs. The eldest is 20 & at university having gone<br/>\nthrough the &#39;normal&#39; school route. the others are 15, 12 & 9<br/>\nI have very quickly discovered how differently they  all learn - the<br/>\nolder of the 3 is doing Cambridge distance learning & is doing extremely<br/>\nwell, despite being very &#39;lazy&#39;.<br/>\nMy 12yr old loves stucture &  flounders somewhat if he doesn&#39;t have his<br/>\nschoolday mapped out for him.<br/>\nThe 9yr old is where the unschooling comes in - he hated all 3 yrs he<br/>\nspent at school & was one of the main reasons we decided to hs.<br/>\nSo we started off the year with all the books & curriculae, & as I said<br/>\nthe older two are geeting along fine with that, but this little one,<br/>\nhates having to write, battles to get thoughts onto paper, but verbalise<br/>\nthem beautifully. We&#39;ve had a whole bunch of tests done & picked up some<br/>\n&#39;problems&#39;, that if he was at school would be labeled, so it&#39;s just as<br/>\nwell we decided to hs.<br/>\nAnyway I&#39;m rambling - sorry.<br/>\nHow do I go about unschooling when I have 2 others who are not ?? As<br/>\neach week goes by I am more & more certain that this is the way to go<br/>\nfor him, but, after having kids in the school sytem for 14yrs I still<br/>\nbattle to &#39;let go&#39;. Does this get easier as time goes on - bearing in<br/>\nmind I&#39;m in South Africa which still has a very small hs community(but<br/>\ngrowing all the time) & an even smaller unschooling one ???<br/>\nSo many questions - so little time!! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nAnne<br/>\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14845,"nextTopicId":14882}}
