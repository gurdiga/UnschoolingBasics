Big hugs to your son and to you ~ it&#39;s<br/>\ntough to find your family in these situations. I don&#39;t have any words of<br/>\nadvice, because I&#39;m going through similar issues with in-laws, and am<br/>\nreading this thread with interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past holiday was rough for us, too. We visited my parent&#39;s house, which<br/>\nwas okay. Lately I&#39;ve talked to my mom (via phone calls) a *lot* about<br/>\npeaceful parenting and respecting children and she&#39;s been fairly receptive.<br/>\nMaybe some of that is starting to sink in because things were better -<br/>\nalthough we did have a disagreement about her making the kids turn off the<br/>\ntv upstairs because she felt it was just &quot;junk&quot; (and then she proceeded to<br/>\nsit down and watch the news, which I *personally* feel is full of &quot;junk&quot;...<br/>\nand being the smart-alec that I am, of course didn&#39;t miss the opportunity to<br/>\npoint this out and comment on the differences between interests and why it&#39;s<br/>\nimpossible (and wrong) to decide these things for another person... but this<br/>\nwent nowhere fast, so I just let it go and apologized to the kids for having<br/>\nto shut off the tv... sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my in-laws are apparently unapproachable about this stuff from any<br/>\nangle - we are making no progress with them because whenever we bring the<br/>\nsubject up they just fidget &quot;politely&quot; and then change the subject. If a<br/>\nreal-life instance brings up the opportunity to discuss these things, they<br/>\njust ignore our comments/input. It&#39;s frustrating. They strongly prefer to<br/>\navoid conflict, so they don&#39;t disagree with us directly, they just pretend<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t say anything. Sometimes we feel like we&#39;ve invisible. DH and I<br/>\nhave looked at each other to confirm that we really did say something out<br/>\nloud, since it seems to have gotten silently sucked up into the vacuum of<br/>\nspace.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spoken to MIL about not spanking ds and she made a disapproving frown<br/>\nbut didn&#39;t say anything. I&#39;ve tried to talk to them about lots of things<br/>\nthat just go unheard, like letting ds go to sleep by himself because he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen a solo sleeper since he was a babe and cannot settle down with other<br/>\npeople in his space (whereas dd is a family bed sleeper). But they insist on<br/>\ntrying to lay down with him, and then give up after two hours and complain<br/>\nabout how little sleep they got all night. I&#39;ve also asked them to give the<br/>\nkids their space when we&#39;re visiting, but they seem to think that&#39;s akin to<br/>\nignoring them, so instead they have an in-their-face-every-second style of<br/>\ninteracting with them ~ and end up complaining about how exhausting the kids<br/>\nare. Um... yeah. I think the kids would say the same thing about them!! It&#39;s<br/>\ndraining!<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago it donned on us that over time we have visited less and<br/>\nless often, but not in a conscious effort to do so. It&#39;s just been a natural<br/>\ndistancing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanksgiving with them was really stressful. We were under the impression<br/>\nthat it was just going to be a small family meal, but when we arrived there<br/>\nwere several neighbors, friends of theirs, and another family (grandma<br/>\nincluded!) that came with my SIL, which made for a really full, noisy house.<br/>\nDs, who is sensitive to these things and is very spirited in even normal<br/>\ncircumstances, teetered on the edge of spinning out of control the whole<br/>\nevening, which made for a lot of quick work and intervention on our part.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to that, which kept us both feeling tense, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s<br/>\n*very* hard for me to hear my natural mom voice when I&#39;m in the presence of<br/>\nmy in-laws... it&#39;s difficult to be at my parenting best in their home<br/>\nbecause it is so the opposite of our home. I really struggle to stay in a<br/>\nspace where I&#39;m patient and kind and can creative problem solve on the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point ds was jumping on the couch and when I tried to redirect him to<br/>\nsomething else he moved up to the back of the couch ~ he was giving off<br/>\nthose &quot;locked in&quot; signals that come just before he explodes in a million<br/>\ndirections. My FIL said something about how he could get down quietly or get<br/>\ndown with a burning butt - I  had a big mental cringe and ds cowered, then<br/>\nrefused to move when I reached for his hand. I was gritting my teeth because<br/>\nds took my FIL&#39;s words to mean that *I* was going to be the spanker. Maybe<br/>\nFIL felt he was being helpful, or he thought I didn&#39;t have the situation<br/>\nunder control so he needed to step in, or maybe it&#39;s &quot;just the way things<br/>\nare done&quot; - I don&#39;t know, but it wasn&#39;t cool under any circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was standing there in a room full of people, feeling really on the spot<br/>\nand wishing that ds and I could be far, far away in another galaxy. I ended<br/>\nup saying very loudly that he was absolutely *not* going to get a spanking<br/>\n(long pause with a reassuring smile)... Could he show me the trainset in the<br/>\nother room? So he finally got down and we walked out together and I could<br/>\njust *feel* the eyes on us and before our shadows were even around the<br/>\ncorner the whispering started. UGH!! So frustrating!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87710633,"authorName":"juillet727","from":"&quot;juillet727&quot; &lt;juillet727@...&gt;","profile":"juillet727","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: desperate questions","postDate":"1196296511","msgId":28082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZpbDFmditmajU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDcxMTI4MDUyM3A1OGY2OTYxY21kMDk2ODE4NDQ1NjUzYzhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28069,"nextInTopic":28083,"prevInTime":28081,"nextInTime":28083,"topicId":28018,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yeah, the hardest part for me is dealing with the things I can t change.
