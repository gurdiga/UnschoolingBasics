I started the SCA in the Midrealm, moved here,<br/>\nthen a short time in Calafia in Caid and then up to An Tir.  An Tir is where<br/>\nmy heart is!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that the SCA isn&#39;t supposed to cater to you and that you get out of<br/>\nit what you put into it.  And while fighting was a big part of the middle<br/>\nages, there was SO much more.  People were living which means that they were<br/>\ncooking, making clothes, building houses, raising children, growing food,<br/>\ntending animals, and entertaining themselves.  All the things that fighters<br/>\ndid when they weren&#39;t fighting.  We have &quot;weekend warriors&quot; and that tends<br/>\nto be all they want to do.  The problem I had with the group here is that<br/>\nit&#39;s hard to get something started when you don&#39;t have the support of the<br/>\ngroup leader (in this case a baron who hated dancing, only wore garb because<br/>\nhe had to, took no effort in doing anything medieval - not sure why he is<br/>\neven in the SCA - oh yeah, he gets to hit people with stick and feel<br/>\npowerful.)  It&#39;s no fun to cook by yourself or explore naming practices of<br/>\nthe Scandinavian people or make music and especially dance.  It&#39;s a LONG<br/>\nstory LOL!!

But...I&#39;d really hate <br/>\nto have this one person&#39;s negative experience influence your decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been in and out of the SCA for about 13 years, and the last 5 my <br/>\nhusband and I have put most of our time into creating a group from <br/>\nscratch in our area. We&#39;ve been through soooooooooo many different <br/>\nsituations and people in that time, and we&#39;ve had people complain that <br/>\nthere&#39;s not enough of this or that. Actually, non-fighters sometimes <br/>\ncomplain about the whole structure of the SCA in general, because it&#39;s <br/>\ncombat oriented. They seem to forget what age we&#39;re recreating- combat <br/>\nwas a large part of life at that time. I myself am not a fighter, so I&#39;m <br/>\nnot speaking from a stick-jock point of view at all, at all. BUT... the <br/>\none thing I can say is that the SCA is what you make of it. The people <br/>\nwho are doing the fighting, decided they wanted to fight, and they <br/>\npursued their interest. Anything A&S oriented (or whatever your <br/>\ninterests are) has to be started by someone. If it&#39;s your interest, and <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t seem to exist, then there&#39;s your niche! Just go for it. I get <br/>\nirked when people seem to think that all activities/ interests/ pursuits <br/>\nneed to be provided for them. If I&#39;m not interested in something, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot likely to get behind making sure it happens- there is, particularly <br/>\nin a small group, plenty of work that already has to be done just to <br/>\nkeep it running, and that takes most of my time already. I have enough <br/>\nof a hard time finding a chance to pursue my own interests in any depth, <br/>\nlet alone try to surmise what others might want out of the SCA and try <br/>\nto provide it for them. The SCA is volunteer based, so any activities <br/>\nthat happen have been planned and organized by some other member. If you <br/>\nwant to see something happen, then make it happen-otherwise you have no <br/>\none to blame but yourself. Talking with the royalty is a good start, but <br/>\nnot by any means the only or even necessarily the best way to get things <br/>\ndone. Forgive me if I sound harsh, but this sounds uncannily similar to <br/>\nso many other complaints I&#39;ve heard over the years, from people who want <br/>\ncertain things to happen, but don&#39;t want to expend any effort to make it <br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, like I said, I could write all day, and maybe I&#39;ve gotten the <br/>\nwrong impression, but you sort of hit a nerve there!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kingdom is it that you&#39;re in?

So when we moved and found out<br/>\nthat they had become a barony it didn&#39;t surprise us as they had been moving<br/>\npositively in that area.  When we moved back and saw that the barony was<br/>\ndoing none of those things anymore, had no guilds or interest nights, was<br/>\nonly doing fighting, did not give a good representation of the SCA when in<br/>\npublic and were not filing reports (much less on time) we were shocked!  I<br/>\nknew the crown princess at the time and had a long talk with her about what<br/>\nwas (not) happening in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, there are no other medieval recreation groups in our area.<br/>\nThe Adrian Empire has several groups in mid and south Florida but nothing<br/>\nclose at all to us.  There is a Confederate War group as well as a<br/>\nRevolutionary War group here.  Their gowns are SO pretty but SO expensive to<br/>\ndo correctly.  There used to be a Sherlock gathering here but that was<br/>\n20-odd years ago and I haven&#39;t seen the guy who used to do that in probably<br/>\n10.  That was fun (but also SO expensive to costume for!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandy, call me if you want to talk more about the SCA or come over sometime<br/>\nand look at my books.  All my costumes are in storage, but I do have photos<br/>\nand miscellaneous jewelry and regalia from when we were involved.<br/>\n<br/>\n  --<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Michelle<br/>\n&gt; Independent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\n&gt; The Pampered Chef<br/>\n&gt; 850-474-0817<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\n&gt; Ask me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157089938,"authorName":"S Drag-teine","from":"&quot;S Drag-teine&quot; &lt;dragteine@...&gt;","profile":"dragteine76","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] If you were in the SCA, could you share your experience?","postDate":"1144772387","msgId":11620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOGUwMWM2NWQ4MyRjODlkZWRkMCRkYzJhOWIwNEBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA0MTEwNjUwbzMwODkzYzY2bGQxNzBiNjE2ZDRiNWY0MWJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11603,"nextInTopic":11623,"prevInTime":11619,"nextInTime":11621,"topicId":11590,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I too am in the SCA what is it that your son is truly interested because I can also suggest some other groups that may interest you more but it depends on what","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-834460406\">I too am in the SCA what is it that your son is truly interested because I<br/>\ncan also suggest some other groups that may interest you more but it depends<br/>\non what you are looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Pampered Chef<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 11, 2006 9:50 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] If you were in the SCA, could you share<br/>\nyour experience?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/11/06, aplan4life &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aplan4life@...\">aplan4life@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We were at a local park and there was a group having knightly battles<br/>\n&gt; so I went and asked what it was and a wonderful woman gave me a brief<br/>\n&gt; history.
