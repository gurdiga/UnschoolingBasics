And, it<br/>\nreally doesn&#39;t look all that difficult - more than WA but not that bad.<br/>\nFile notice when you get there (but it&#39;s not annual, just once when you<br/>\nstart); testing OF YOUR CHOICE at grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 (so you can use<br/>\nsomething like PASS which is designed to be done at home however you<br/>\nwant pretty much, and an annual progress report which can be a written<br/>\nevaluation from the parent. So, keeping a journal and then translating<br/>\nit once a year would be most of what you need to do most years. In the<br/>\ntesting years, no written evaluation because of the testing. I suppose<br/>\nit may be pretty locally variable so I&#39;d want to touch base with some<br/>\nfolks there (I&#39;d bet there&#39;s a yahoo group for homeschoolers if not<br/>\nunschoolers who could help you with the ropes).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
