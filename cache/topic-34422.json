After reading the book the Gift of Dyslexia, I felt like I had some more tools in my pocket to help him out.  We have never mentioned to him that we think he might be dyslexic because I didn&#39;t want him to have that label, and after I read the book, I put it out of my own mind and knew his mind just works a little differently.  There is no reason to pin him with that tag and make him feel like there is something wrong with him.  My son really wanted to read.  He was passionate about it, but he would get frustrated with it and cry.  Once I had those tools, when he came to me and wanted me to teach him to read, I used what I now knew and he took it with him and used/uses it on his own.  I recently heard him in his room doing some of the things we were doing together to help him and I am happy to say he has officially crossed that threshold and is reading without all the frustration.  My suggestion to you is to certainly not be attached to your child reading when he or you wants him to.  That was very hard advice for me to take, but I did and in that alone there is a lot of freedom.  Do not label him, be concerned that it might be going on, figure out what you all need to do as a family, but don&#39;t let him know it is something that concerns you because it could potentially stand in his way and lastly, believe that he may just straighten things out on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nSarah<br/>\nwww.laughingstararts.com<br/>\nwww.thehubb4.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34225,"nextTopicId":5427}}
