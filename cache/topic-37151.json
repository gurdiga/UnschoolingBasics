But there ya&#39; go. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf no one remembers, and even if they do, I will definitely pull some things<br/>\nfrom the &quot;Childhood is not a Dress Rehearsal&quot;, which I love.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that the day after my friend, Lisa, died and left her husband, Larry, and two beautiful <br/>\n<br/>\ndaughters, Fire & Roxanne. I was in the midst of thinking about Hannah, who died at 9.5 only a <br/>\n<br/>\nyear before. It was a tough month.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys left today for a road trip to Boston. I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t worry about them. I DO. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I know that, overall, my time with them has been magical---for them and me. Maybe not every<br/>\n<br/>\nday, every moment. But even at a bad moment, if I can look at them, breathe, and imagine life<br/>\n<br/>\nwithout them, I can calm down in a heartbeat and treasure my time with them. *Every* minute.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s contagious too. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s sooo easy to get angry...FURIOUS...and take it out on our <br/>\n<br/>\nkids. In turn, that&#39;s the path they take too. I see that all the time with my children&#39;s friends<br/>\n<br/>\nan<br/>\nd with my friends too. By changing the way I deal with my anger and my frustration, I can see the<br/>\n<br/>\ndifference in my boys. They see others as always doing their best---even if it&#39;s not THE best.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking that extra second or two to realize that *I* can control how this unfolds---at least how *I*<br/>\n<br/>\nunfold &lt;g&gt;---I have the opportunity to make it better.

The text of a message from Kelly Lovejoy, written/posted Feb 26, 2008 -- <br/>\n<br/>\nChildhood Is Not A Dress Rehearsal<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;tag line&quot; of the accountability association I run in SC to allow families to homeschool is &quot;Childhood is NOT a dress rehearsal.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I get reminded of this every now and then. Not that I don&#39;t *need* to be reminded. It&#39;s just that I wish I weren&#39;t reminded in such a harsh way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most traditional, conventional parents think of something different when they hear or read it. I think they start considering that we only have this one chance to push our children to do better, to be better, and to strive harder for that medical degree or career choice or...&quot;success&quot; or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not the message I get.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been thinking about what to write now for several days to honor the memory of Hannah Jenner, who died two years ago on February 24. I&#39;d wanted to toss out there that we really DO only have so much time to spend with our children---and even though we *think* have the rest of their lives to do and be with them, there&#39;s no guarantee that they won&#39;t be taken from us a whole lot sooner than we think. The time they spend with us should be full of joy and fun and happy, happy thoughts. Their time with us should be filled with *our* joy in them---that they know that our world is a better place *because* of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah&#39;s short life is a tough reminder for me to enjoy the children I have---and every single minute. And not a day goes by that I don&#39;t think of Hannah (and Sam Wilkerson and Jacob Strebler). &#39;Cause I just don&#39;t know what I would do without Cameron and Duncan. But sometimes, when I&#39;m not my best and my temper is short, I *need* that little reminder---that this time is a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often, parents can work so hard helping our children &quot;become&quot; that we forget to enjoy Who They *Are*--right now, this minute. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman&#39;s passing yesterday has stunned this community. And I just can&#39;t imagine the pain and loss the Gauchmans are experiencing right now. But I *know* that the girls, Roxy and Fire, will know that their mom truly valued the time she had with them. She chose to keep the girls close and let them grow &quot;In Their Own Way, In Their Own Time.&quot; That&#39;s a gift we can ALL give our children. To accept Who They Are---and to revel in it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa understood that childhood is not a dress rehearsal. Lisa worked hard to give her girls he space they needed to grow. She gave them inspired, joyful childhoods. There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind that Roxy and Fire will thrive in spite of their huge, huge loss. And a big part of that is the love and acceptance Lisa showered on them. They will kept warm with her light.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHer passing will continue to be a reminder that *my* time with my kids is limited as well. I can choose to make the most of each moment with them as she did. Our world is brighter because of Lisa. And I&#39;m glad I got to know her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love and Many Hugs to Larry and Roxy and Fire.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\n    www.ourhapahome365.blogspot.com<br/>\nwww.mysquareone.blogspot.com         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217951851,"authorName":"c3_2323","from":"&quot;c3_2323&quot; &lt;craigiecarter@...&gt;","profile":"c3_2323","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Need help finding a recent post","postDate":"1228428077","msgId":37151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdoOWp2ZCtuZ2cxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37154,"prevInTime":37150,"nextInTime":37152,"topicId":37151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, Someone recently posted something about how they hung up reminders to help them keep perspective.
