We did more of that <br/>\nwhen<br/>\nthe kids were younger, but my personal interests have gotten more<br/>\naesthetic and my husband&#39;s have only gotten more literary, and the <br/>\nkids<br/>\naren&#39;t interested in sharing in what we&#39;re involved with that much.<br/>\nThey have their own stuff going -- reading, Model United Nations,<br/>\nlibrary volunteer work for the eldest; writing, SIMS, fashion design<br/>\nfor the youngest.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it depends.<br/>\nIf your kids are happy and they&#39;re aware those things exist, then it <br/>\njust might not be important at this stage in life. I&#39;ve found as my <br/>\nkids get older, our interests DO get more divergent and I&#39;m off with <br/>\nthe little ones more often.<br/>\nBut, if they are interested in these kind of activities, I think <br/>\nit&#39;s the parents job to provide them, even if it isn&#39;t a shared <br/>\ninterest.<br/>\nThere&#39;s always other families to share these activites with, or <br/>\nmaybe parents can take turns. There are ways to meet their needs for <br/>\na rich, interesting environment without being the only one to <br/>\nprovide it.:)<br/>\nIt sounds like their lives are interesting though, and maybe that&#39;s <br/>\njust where you all are right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4826,"nextTopicId":4822}}
