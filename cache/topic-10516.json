Others have mentioned gum (they obviously have to be old enough  not to <br/>\nchoke on it), twizzlers, pacifiers, straws, chew toys for babies, or  anything <br/>\nthat is hard enough to chew on.  Therapists often use rubber (some  kind of <br/>\nplastic) tubing that kids can chew on and wear around their necks if  they want <br/>\nas a necklace.  My daughter likes to chew on the edges of her  &quot;security&quot;pillow <br/>\nand has almost chewed thru several.  Some kids also like  to just have <br/>\nsomething in their mouth more often- here, have a carrot.<br/>\nWhen they get older- they chew the tops of their pens!<br/>\nAnd of course, also the dialogue about &quot;biting hurts, etc.&quot;  but if  they <br/>\naren&#39;t biting out of delight or malice, they are propbably just needing  more <br/>\noral stimulation than average.<br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nAmanda B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10503,"nextTopicId":10493}}
