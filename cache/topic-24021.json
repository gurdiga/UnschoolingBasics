It did<br/>\nnot go well at all.<br/>\n***<br/>\nIs this your husband you are talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, he needs to put some effort into doing the research too. Hsing,<br/>\nincluding unschooling, is not like public school. The choices are not<br/>\nmade for you. There is a lot of freedom and many choices and it takes<br/>\nsome research to find your own path. And then the patience and nerve to<br/>\nchange paths as needed! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne resource he might like is www.NHEN.org. It doesn&#39;t push unschooling<br/>\nbut has a lot of info on hsing in general. And it has a page called For<br/>\nDads by Dads -- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/dads/default.asp?id=306\">http://www.nhen.org/dads/default.asp?id=306</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt can take some time to become completely comfortable with hsing and<br/>\nunschooling. And some effort to understand all the options.<br/>\n<br/>\nUrge him to take the time and make the effort. He will be well rewarded!<br/>\nWho knows? He may well end up being one of the more outspoken advocates<br/>\nfor unschooling -- like my DH. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24010,"nextTopicId":10043}}
