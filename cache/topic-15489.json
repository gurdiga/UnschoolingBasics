Do we need to do this for our kids to get <br/>\nthe most out of the games, or can we just let them go at it and <br/>\nabsorb it on their own, to later think about the context of the game <br/>\n(or not)?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother article I came across cited a British study of kids and <br/>\nlearning through gaming, but the games used in the study were <br/>\nlimited to a few like Bob the Builder and such.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone out there have any links to actual studies, not just <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s writing citing a study?  <br/>\n<br/>\nTIA-<br/>\nDawn O</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15519,"nextTopicId":15524}}
