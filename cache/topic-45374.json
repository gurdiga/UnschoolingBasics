It&#39;s being given a lower priority than  <br/>\nrelationships and joy. Some parents have decided the risks of having  <br/>\nsome chemicals in their food is much less than the risks of  <br/>\ncontrolling their children&#39;s food.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can some parents do that when there&#39;s so much information about  <br/>\nhow bad some chemicals are?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst by recognizing that a massive amount of the information is  <br/>\ncreated by people who are afraid of the chemicals. And fearful people  <br/>\nare really good at proving their fears and not very good at being  <br/>\nobjective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t some truth buried in there but the level  <br/>\nof fear for some people is seen as out of proportion to the danger.  <br/>\nDrano is toxic. People shouldn&#39;t eat it. They&#39;ll probably die very  <br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something in a food (whether it&#39;s a food chemical like the allergen  <br/>\nin wheat or some processing chemical) has an immediate effect, kids  <br/>\ncan learn what makes them feel good and what makes them feel bad if  <br/>\nthey&#39;re given the freedom to be aware of their bodies by trying  <br/>\ndifferent foods out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something in a food takes decades to have an effect, this is not an  <br/>\nimminent danger. And some parents have decided the risks of control,  <br/>\nthe risks of living in fear of food are far greater than the risks of  <br/>\nthe chemicals. (They will provide information they believe is  <br/>\nimportant as it comes up in life but won&#39;t use it to steer their  <br/>\nchildren to make particular choices. It&#39;s information for the kids to  <br/>\nturn over and decide for themselves.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond by recognizing that over the course of a childhood, in a home  <br/>\nwhere healthy meals and snacks are provided, the amount of processed  <br/>\nfood the child will add to that will be small and the amount of fear  <br/>\nand control needed to eliminate that small amount in a world where  <br/>\nit&#39;s readily available will be large.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do we care for our children and allow them the freedom to eat  <br/>\n&gt; what we know is simply toxic?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re absolutely certain some foods are toxic then you keep those  <br/>\naway from your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make keeping toxic food from your kids a priority, when it clashes  <br/>\nwith other priorities like freedom to explore or experiencing the  <br/>\nguilt-free joy of a red dyed popsicle on a hot afternoon, then that  <br/>\npriority will need to override the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery choice, even the best choices, has its pros and cons. For you  <br/>\nthe pro of what you believe is a healthier body outweighs the  <br/>\npotential con of the effects of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor others, they&#39;re not as convinced that the potential (if any)  <br/>\nhealth benefits of avoiding processed foods outweighs the effects of  <br/>\ncontrol.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve read, I&#39;m assuming, loads about the toxic effects of some  <br/>\nprocessed food. Don&#39;t you also want to know the toxic effects of  <br/>\ncontrol so you can make an informed choice? Don&#39;t you want to know  <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re giving up to get what you believe you&#39;ll get by keeping  <br/>\nprocessed foods from your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what people are trying to do. There&#39;s very very little written  <br/>\nabout the effects of control on kids because it&#39;s a constant of most  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives. Most people don&#39;t know! They think kids act  <br/>\ndefiantly, are contrary, selfish because they&#39;re kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers, though, know differently. And we see how our kids aren&#39;t  <br/>\nacting like supposedly &quot;normal&quot; kids. We see how our teens aren&#39;t  <br/>\ndoing the antagonistic teen rebellion thing that supposedly comes with  <br/>\nbeing a teen. Because of that special knowledge, we can help people  <br/>\nmake more informed decisions around the idea of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour certainty in the rightness of your beliefs does not negate the  <br/>\neffects of control. Parents want it to! They want to be able to guide  <br/>\ntheir children to the right choices and have their kids embrace those  <br/>\nchoices because they&#39;re right choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut human nature doesn&#39;t work that way. A fundamentalist Christian is  <br/>\nabsolutely certain they&#39;re right, but that certainty doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nautomatically make me see their rightness. Their need to make me  <br/>\nbelieve makes me turn away. The more strongly someone wants me to  <br/>\nbelieve their version of truth, the more likely I am to back off.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if someone practices their values for themselves  <br/>\nand is careful to not impose them on me, if those values make them  <br/>\nhappy, I&#39;m more likely to be intrigued.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are a special breed of person because they are more likely to  <br/>\naccept parents&#39; information. (Not all kids! Some kids very much need  <br/>\nto decide for themselves by exploring, not by being told what&#39;s the  <br/>\nright decision.) So they&#39;re likely to trust us when we say Santa&#39;s  <br/>\nreal, or that food has toxic chemicals in it, or that the positive  <br/>\ntreatment of witches and magic in that movie will corrupt your soul.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if our information, our decisions for our kids are a roadblock  <br/>\nbetween kids and something they find intriguing, they start feeling  <br/>\nthe control in our &quot;help&quot; to help them be better people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you&#39;re right about the toxicity of chemicals in processed  <br/>\nfood, or where a soul goes if someone hasn&#39;t accepted Jesus as their  <br/>\npersonal savior, or the ability of TV to zombify brains, it still  <br/>\nfeels like control to the one who doesn&#39;t have the freedom to choose  <br/>\nand explore according to their own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nControl has some potentially negative consequences. I listed some  <br/>\nbefore (they&#39;re below). Here some others. You can dismiss them if you  <br/>\nwish. You can decide they&#39;re not as bad as the chemicals in processed  <br/>\nfood. But this list is about supporting people who want to put  <br/>\nrelationships and joy and freedom to explore first and then want to  <br/>\nfigure out how to fit the rest of life around that. Who want to figure  <br/>\nout how to hold strong beliefs without interfering with their  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s free explorations.<br/>\n<br/>\nControlling food or anything that most people have ready access to  <br/>\nlike books and movies has some special potential negative  <br/>\nconsequences. Kids will see other kids and adults eating the  <br/>\nsupposedly toxic foods and watching the supposedly toxic movies who  <br/>\nare not showing negative effects and:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) decide their parents are full of whooey and start taking their  <br/>\nadvice with a big load of salt.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) be afraid for those people and want to tell them how they&#39;re  <br/>\ndamaging themselves. (Unschooling parents have had fundamentalist  <br/>\nChristian kids say their kids are going to Hell because they read  <br/>\nHarry Potter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) be afraid the world is too complex and they&#39;re too ignorant to  <br/>\nfigure out what is safe so need experts to tell them. (Which is  <br/>\nsimilar to 4 below but slightly different.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the ones I listed before:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Kids can learn to sneak. If there&#39;s something they really want and  <br/>\nyou&#39;re a roadblock between them and it, they&#39;re put in a position of  <br/>\nneeding to find a way around you.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Kids can be so irritated by the control, they choose to go the  <br/>\nopposite way &quot;just because&quot;. The goal becomes choosing the opposite of  <br/>\nwhat the parent wants, regardless of the negative effects. (This is  <br/>\nthe root cause of teen rebellion. When there is no control. when kids  <br/>\ntrust their parents are on their side trying to find safe, respectful  <br/>\ndoable ways to get what they want, rebellion doesn&#39;t exist.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Control focuses attention on what can&#39;t be had, elevating its  <br/>\nimportance. Freely accessible Pringles are not nearly as desirable as  <br/>\nforbidden Pringles. I can have as many Pringles as I want. I had a  <br/>\nfair number of them as a child. As an adult, I don&#39;t want them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Kids can tune out their own inner voices in favor of experts who  <br/>\nknow what&#39;s best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This is not &quot;fear-mongering&quot;! As I said, If you do not agree with  <br/>\n&gt; this Look it up. Aren&#39;t we all about natural here when it comes to  <br/>\n&gt; growth of the human mind, etc? I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN&#39;T GO  <br/>\n&gt; HAND IN HAND.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because natural learning is about discovering for one&#39;s self. Limiting  <br/>\nkids to foods you believe is natural/healthful can only be done  <br/>\nthrough control.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can control &quot;nicely&quot; by explaining why but it&#39;s still control. (If  <br/>\nyour husband patiently explained why your favorite genre of novels  <br/>\nwere bad for you every time you wanted one, it wouldn&#39;t feel like  <br/>\nenlightenment. It would feel like control.) Depending on the child&#39;s  <br/>\npersonality, they may feel the &quot;nice&quot; control more strongly than more  <br/>\ncompliant kids. But even &quot;nice&quot; control will have negative effects.  <br/>\nYou may decide the negative effects are worth it but that doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>\nthey won&#39;t be there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might find a list about natural living suits you better. Some  <br/>\npeople confuse unschooling with natural living and get further  <br/>\nconfused when unschoolers talk about processed foods, TV and video  <br/>\ngames. If someone&#39;s priority is natural living, then *natural  <br/>\nlearning* can be part of that. But if someone&#39;s priority is  <br/>\nunschooling, then freedom to explore will take precedence when a child  <br/>\nwants an Oreo or HoHo or Pringles. (Unschoolers who are into natural  <br/>\nfoods will choose natural foods as the foundation of the food in their  <br/>\nhome but support their children&#39;s explorations into other foods by  <br/>\nadding their children&#39;s choices to the home rather than seeing it as  <br/>\nan either/or situation.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW the ingredients of Pringles are:<br/>\n<br/>\nDRIED POTATOES, VEGETABLE OIL (CONTAINS ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING:  <br/>\nCORN OIL, COTTONSEED OIL, SOYBEAN OIL, AND/OR SUNFLOWER OIL), RICE  <br/>\nFLOUR, WHEAT STARCH, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT AND DEXTROSE.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248233800,"authorName":"Alix deBohun","from":"Alix deBohun &lt;czarena_unrest@...&gt;","profile":"czarena_unrest","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Has Anyone Had This Experience? - the behavior of parents","postDate":"1291725080","msgId":45406,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxOTU1NC40MTEzNy5xbUB3ZWIxMTIwMDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzNjQ5My42NTA1Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlkamNmZitmODRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OENENjNCMDc0RjM3MTQwLTFBQjAtMzdCRDFAV2VibWFpbC1tMTE0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW5adTk2dXNWRjlobmpyQ0RXZ0x6c0pXdFhnbzNtY3JxUG56czJ5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NzczODMzLjk1Njk2LnFtQHdlYjExMjAwMS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw2MTE3OTMuNTAxOTEucW1Ad2ViODYyMDMubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPiA8NDA1NzcuNzMxODYucW1Ad2ViMTEyMDA2Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDUzNjQ5My42NTA1Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45405,"nextInTopic":45407,"prevInTime":45405,"nextInTime":45407,"topicId":45374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I guess I can see that, I just wish that people would be more careful with their words online.

Her comment about her unschooled kid beating <br/>\n<br/>\nup your can of Pringles and your pitcher of Kool-aid is about how not powerless <br/>\nthey are in the face of those food choices. The OP wrote that she couldn&#39;t have <br/>\ncertain food in her house because of her own inability to not eat it. Kelly&#39;s <br/>\nresponse was about how those foods don&#39;t become the center of her unschooled <br/>\nkid&#39;s world when they enter into the house. I honestly don&#39;t think rude is at <br/>\nall what she was intending. <br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that pringles and kool-aid are poisonous is a lie. Or it&#39;s a lie on the <br/>\nsame level as saying that water is poisonous. Water can kill you if you drink to <br/>\n<br/>\nmuch, you drown internally. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a> says <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Water can be considered a poison when over-consumed just like any other <br/>\nsubstance&quot; although I think that&#39;s a strange use of the word poison. Probably no <br/>\n<br/>\nmore strange than saying that pringles or kool-aid are poisonous though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is fear-mongering to talk about things as poison that aren&#39;t. To share a <br/>\nfear that isn&#39;t based in fact, to try and rally folks round to get them to be <br/>\nmore afraid of something than they already are. It is a kind of Chicken Little <br/>\napproach to food. The sky isn&#39;t falling.

Is stress more or less <br/>\ndetrimental to one&#39;s health then pringles and koolaid? Stress has been linked to <br/>\na lot of poor decision making and quite directly to early death. I&#39;m pretty sure <br/>\nthe jury is out on pringles and koolaid. Red dye number whatever may be a fear, <br/>\nbut it isn&#39;t nearly as awful on your immune system as stress is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&quot;When someone points out that it&#39;s unhealthy, those parents become defensive <br/>\n&gt;&gt;and accuse them of lying, fear mongering,judging, and the like.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think my lifestyle is an unhealthy life. I don&#39;t think the choices I <br/>\nmake and that I afford my children, and that&#39;s a big lot of choices, are ones <br/>\nthat make me feel in the least bit defensive. I can tell you that I have two <br/>\nhealthy children who have a very wide range of food choices. They drink soda and <br/>\nwater and juice and milk and lassis and koolaid and they eat chips, pringles <br/>\namong them, and melba toast and olives and pears and chocolate and broccoli and <br/>\nbread and beef jerky and chicken and pound cake ala Duncan Lovejoy and cabbage <br/>\nand apples and plums and clementines and bananas and, well, and and and. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth of what you don&#39;t seem to be reading, which I see written clearly in <br/>\nthe responses, is that limiting a food choice, saying that this is crap food and <br/>\nthis is good food is a great way to create a special and exciting class of <br/>\nfoods. I tend to eat what I&#39;m hungry for. I wanted fish and chips the other day <br/>\nand David and I went to a fish monger and bought lovely haddock and fried it up <br/>\nwith homemade chips (french fries) and had mushy peas as a side. It was <br/>\nwonderful. I thanked David and he said he likes to satisfy my cravings (eyebrows <br/>\nawaggling). Because we do the same with Simon and Linnaea there are often things <br/>\nthat come into our menu suddenly. Risotto is an oft requested food, or samosas <br/>\nor Simon was craving fry ups the last few days, so we got bacon and sausages <br/>\nfrom the local butcher and scrambled eggs and he had lovely homemade bread <br/>\ntoasted with lashings of butter. I asked him yesterday if he wanted us to get <br/>\nhim more of that, but he&#39;s moved on to other desires. Last night they had phad <br/>\nthai, we all had phad thai, but Simon and Linnaea supersized their bowlfuls <br/>\nwhile David and I had more modest portions to accommodate their desires. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one food is crap and another food is good and you really want the crap what <br/>\ndoes that make you? If one food is crap and another food is good and the crap <br/>\nfood makes you feel better what does that mean? I love potatoes at the moment. <br/>\nIt&#39;s dark and cold here and potatoes make me feel lighter and better. A friend <br/>\njust sent me an NPR thing on chip butties which just spiked my craving for a <br/>\nlovely french fry sandwich. It will be good for lunch today. It isn&#39;t crap, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t nutritionally devoid, it isn&#39;t empty calories, it&#39;s a lovely food that <br/>\nincreases my beta-endorphins. I get happier with potatoes. It&#39;s so cool. <br/>\nPringles are made from potatoes, maybe they do a similar thing? More than that <br/>\nthough, sharing a can of pringles with someone happily and talking about <br/>\nhyperbolic paraboloids will be better for them than denying and degrading their <br/>\ndesire. It will be better for your relationship with them, it will be better for <br/>\ntheir whole self health, it will let the pringles be secondary to the <br/>\nrelationship instead of more powerful than the love and care and nurturing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou write that &quot;dyes and chemicals in our food is NOT healthy, many think they <br/>\nare toxic even.&quot; And while there is some evidence for detrimental effects of <br/>\nchemicals on the health of people, much of those chemicals come from pollutants <br/>\nas opposed to ones that are directly in the food supply. Mercury in tuna comes <br/>\nto mind, or hormones from large scale meat production, the waste of hormonally <br/>\nmore than robust cattle washing into the water supply. Soy produces <br/>\nphytoestrogens which can screw with your hormonal balance in ways that have been <br/>\nshown to be both positive and negative. I don&#39;t know if pringles do that but <br/>\ntofu can. <br/>\n<br/>\nI bet you ever single person who has chosen to embrace choice in food for their <br/>\nchildren on this list is aware of at least the gist of the findings on sodium <br/>\nbenzoate or similar additives. And for each of those people they&#39;ve decided that <br/>\nthe fear of those things isn&#39;t as great as their desire to help their children <br/>\nto negotiate the world on their own terms. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote &quot;What I&#39;m seeing here is that some parents have chosen to give their <br/>\nchildren free choice over their nutritional intake with little to no <br/>\nexceptions.&quot;  I imagine that there are lots of exceptions in my children&#39;s <br/>\nlives. Availability is an exception. Affordability is an exception. Kraft <br/>\nmacaroni and cheese is a treat reserved for arrivals of gift packages or gift <br/>\nbearing visitors from the U.S. It isn&#39;t readily available in the UK. Maybe with <br/>\nKraft&#39;s owning Cadbury&#39;s now it will give them access to this market, but maybe <br/>\nnot. There are conversations about hunger in our house. About food. I talk a lot <br/>\nand about lots of things. My guess is that they make informed choices about <br/>\ntheir hunger and how to satisfy it rather than free choices. A lot of their <br/>\ninformation will be from experience. Simon loves carrot cake, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike me to make it very often because it becomes less special, more mundane. He <br/>\nwants the carrot cake to remain a special occasion food. That&#39;s a lot of <br/>\nunderstanding, and it was understanding that he had at 6. If I had dictated to <br/>\nhim his relationship with carrot cake rather than letting him dictate his own <br/>\nterms he would have felt powerless in the face of the all powerful carrot cake. <br/>\nBut there is no rush to carrot cake, there is no carrot cake is the biggest <br/>\nthing in the room. Carrot cake is a pleasure among many. It&#39;s so cool. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&quot;Why the accusations? Why are people being so hateful to each other <br/>\n&gt;&gt;while preaching to be kind to the children? &quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Where is the hate? Where is the horribleness? I see people writing about <br/>\nunschooling in response to someone writing about fear. Sometimes it can feel <br/>\nlike someone is being attacked, but if you go back and reread it with your mind <br/>\ntuned to hear kindness in the words of the writers your perspective may change. <br/>\nIt may help if you start with the knowledge that all of these writers are <br/>\nworking to help get the philosophy of unschooling out clearly and precisely. And <br/>\nthey are doing this without recompense, or, at least, without financial <br/>\nrecompense. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To tell someone that they are lying is the opposite of what we are trying to <br/>\ndo <br/>\nwith our children. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t quite know what that means. I have questioned the veracity of what Simon <br/>\nor Linnaea have said. The other day it was about the core temperature of the <br/>\nearth. Simon was sound in his understanding. And it was fun to be proven wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Alix deBohun &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:czarena_unrest@...\">czarena_unrest@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 7 December, 2010 2:28:56<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Has Anyone Had This Experience? - the <br/>\nbehavior of parents<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m seeing here is that some parents have chosen to give their children <br/>\nfree choice over their nutritional intake with little to no exceptions. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone points out that it&#39;s unhealthy, those parents become defensive and <br/>\naccuse them of lying, fear mongering,judging, and the like.<br/>\n  <br/>\nI tell my son that it is better to be wrong than to make up a story. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not say yes, I know it&#39;s not the healthiest but I feel it&#39;s important to <br/>\nallow them these choices.

He is still eating pringles just not exclusively.  As we speak he is eating tuna and crackers with a kool aide jammer watching Animaniacs.  He is quite content and so am I.  It took a lot of hard work on my part, a lot of letting go to get to this place of peace with food choices (and I am still working hard).  I will say we are all happier because of it.  Even when I am in the closet sitting on my hands so I don&#39;t unleash my negative food opinions on him I am happier because I know when he is my age he will eat because he is hungry and won&#39;t feel guilty about what he eats like I do.

That would never be the goal I am sure of anyone in this group. I understand fostering individualism and inner knowing. I am not arguing with those concepts. I bring to the table something that seems to be going ignored here. The truth of what IS in some of our foods that so many people do not want to notice as hazardous to human health. And yes, How do we care for our children and allow them the freedom to eat what we know is simply toxic? This is not &quot;fear-mongering&quot;! As I said, If you do not agree with this Look it up.

He lived on chicken nuggets and<br/>\nfrench fries for at least 2 years.  I didn&#39;t know about radical unschooling<br/>\nback then, and my mother insisted that I make him eat what we were eating<br/>\nfor dinner (I lived with her at the time).  He didn&#39;t eat dinner for almost<br/>\na month before I decided that wasn&#39;t going to work.  Even during that time<br/>\nI&#39;d give him chicken nuggets and french fries for breakfast and lunch, and<br/>\nadd veggies and other stuff to his plate which he would occasionally eat,<br/>\nbut not always.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards he refused to try new foods for almost 3 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he&#39;s 10 y/o.  He still loves chicken nuggets and french fries, but<br/>\nprefers homemade over mcdonalds or frozen ones.  He loves going into the<br/>\ngrocery store and picking out new foods to try.  He willingly tries almost<br/>\neverything I cook.  One of his favorite cooked veggies is brussel sprouts,<br/>\nanother is spinach.  I&#39;m allergic to spinach (will break out in a rash if I<br/>\ncome in contact with anything that has contacted spinach) and therefore he<br/>\nonly gets to have it when he cooks it himself or someone else is around to<br/>\ncook it, so it&#39;s a special treat for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we were going to a movie, which was financially a stretch for<br/>\nus. We discussed beforehand that we wouldn&#39;t be able to buy much at the<br/>\nconcession stand.  He asked if we could buy him dibs (the chocolate covered<br/>\nice cream bits).  They&#39;re around $7 at the theatre for a tiny box of them,<br/>\nso I said we couldn&#39;t buy them there, but would  get some after the movie at<br/>\nthe grocery store.  He instead asked if he could take a bag of banana chips<br/>\nand some baby carrots into the movie with him, because he didn&#39;t want<br/>\npopcorn or candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day he made a banana and Hershey kisses sandwich for lunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also went through a pringles phase, and I found them on sale at CVS for<br/>\nunder a dollar a can.  I think I bought 20 cans.  He went through 10 of them<br/>\nin a week, but it&#39;s been a few months now and we still have some unopened<br/>\ncans in the pantry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s a tall skinny kid who eats almost non stop throughout the day.  His<br/>\nchoices are wide and varied over the course of each week, however he tends<br/>\nto obsess on certian foods on any given day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s learned to listen to his body.  When he had some urinary problems after<br/>\ndrinking nothing but soda for weeks, we discussed that too much soda could<br/>\nbe part of the problem.  I didn&#39;t tell him he had to stop drinking soda, or<br/>\ntell him how much water he had to drink, but the next day he made a line in<br/>\nthe fridge of 2 bottles of water, followed by a can of soda, two more<br/>\nbottles of water, followed by a can of soda, etc. etc.  He asked everyone to<br/>\nleave those drinks alone because it was his way of making sure he drank<br/>\nenough water between sodas.  He no longer has to line them up in the fridge,<br/>\nbut when I offer to get him a drink he sometimes asks for water, sometimes<br/>\nfor soda, sometimes juice, sometimes tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no struggles over food here anymore.  Tonight we all decided on<br/>\ntaco&#39;s for dinner, then I realized we didn&#39;t have any ground beef.  I let<br/>\nhim know I was making them with chicken instead and he was hesitant, but<br/>\ntried them without an argument and said they were great.  If he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave liked them I would have cooked him something else, or let him have a<br/>\n&quot;buffet&quot; dinner of various snacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Dec 6, 2010 at 6:00 PM, Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Pringles and Kool-aid aren&#39;t poisonous.

Really, if you lived in the wild and gave your child free range choice for her diet, wouldn&#39;t you stop her if she reached for a poisonous berry or mushroom? It is one thing to offer free choice and it is another to avoid important information around what is healthy for the human body. Allowing your child to feast on nutrient void junk filled with toxic chemicals is to me the same as letting her eat poison. It just will take a bit longer to kill her. Our children need to learn about the dangers of eating toxic chemical laden foods, foods sprayed with pesticides, animal products pumped with hormones,etc. and foods genetically modified. Until they can read it for themselves labels should be a part of this free choice plan and education on what the ingredients are and where they come from, etc. I find my daughter makes very healthy choices for herself based on the facts that she understands about the ingredients in the foods. She does make exceptions and eats items that are not the healthiest choice sometimes, but with the knowledge of exactly what she is eating, she tends to keep unhealthy choices to a minimum. She generally opts for very healthy foods. Our home is stocked with mostly healthy foods and when we shop, if she picks up an item that she wants to try I have her read the ingredients. Mostly she makes very wise choices to keep her body healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Diane&quot; &lt;dianetargovnik@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I do think there can be a happy balance that doesn&#39;t include buying pringles (which are expensive! $3 for a can on sale is a lot more then ten cents an hour).

The goal becomes choosing the opposite of  <br/>\nwhat the parent wants, regardless of the negative effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Control focuses attention on what can&#39;t be had, elevating its  <br/>\nimportance.

I kept making monkey platters and he kept asking for pringles and kool aide jammers (I added these to the platters but when he ate what was there he just went and got the tube of chips for more.) I locked myself in the closet at one point and called a friend because my anxiety about it lasting much longer was getting really high.  I don&#39;t know what I would do if it lasted for months.  I don&#39;t have any advice but I feel for you and wanted to let you know.  Sometimes it&#39;s nice if I know I&#39;m not alone in a struggle.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45823,"nextTopicId":45843}}
