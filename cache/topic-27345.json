Like many post before, I&#39;ve noticed<br/>\nparents with good intentions posting thier advice and opinion, gets<br/>\ncritisized for non &quot;unschooling&quot; praticises.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s because it&#39;s an UNSCHOOLING list, and any advice that is counter <br/>\nto unschooling will be criticized---no matter what the intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver been on a vegetarian e-list and suggested that folks that eat just <br/>\na little meat are still vegetarians and maybe *should* eat a little <br/>\nmeat because it&#39;s good for you? Try it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe origin of this topic, I assumed was someone asking for support<br/>\nfrom other unschooling non-screen families, and perhaps wanting a<br/>\nbetter insight of these families work around thier tv issues and a<br/>\nlittle bit of support. And many did reply, offering scenarios of<br/>\nthier approach to tv, some are very suportive of tv, some not so,<br/>\nwhich was great, because now the person have a wide choice of options<br/>\nto mull about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those posts were made by people new to unschooling AND parents of <br/>\nvery young children. We let those posts go through, but no one was <br/>\ngoing to let them BE unschooling advice about TVs. It *will* get <br/>\nchallenged.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n And for a non-screen parent to offer some insights of<br/>\nhow thier &quot;limited screen time&quot; work in thier lives, it is offered in<br/>\ngood faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGood faith or not, it doesn&#39;t jive with helping others understand how <br/>\nNOT limiting things *does* work. It doesn&#39;t help others understand <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n She believes in what she<br/>\nconstitudes to be addictive behaviour in her children, and is doing<br/>\nwhat she believes is best for her children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is NOT addictive. It&#39;s entertaining and informative...and often the <br/>\nmost interesting thing in the house. By limiting it and making it a <br/>\nscarcity, she&#39;s making it even *more* attractive to her children. <br/>\nBringing *more* entertaining, *more* informative, *more* interesting <br/>\nthings into their lives will decrease their viewing---simply because <br/>\nchildren LIKE interesting, informative entertainment. If she&#39;s failing <br/>\nin that respect, her children *should* watch more TV. But they aren&#39;t <br/>\naddicted.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doeasn&#39;t mean<br/>\nshe felt we &quot;tv believing parents&quot; was irreponsible to allow our<br/>\nchildren to be tv- addict zombie. I don&#39;t think anybody should take<br/>\nit as a personal insult! She was merely stating what she believes is<br/>\nworking for them. (How and why, we won&#39;t know because we are not part<br/>\nof her family). And that to her the tv can invoke the addicitive<br/>\nelement, in her and her children and she&#39;s found a way to balance<br/>\nthat.  And this is possible. I have known of some children or adults<br/>\nwho&#39;s just not interested in tvs or pc at all, what luck for the<br/>\nparents!!<br/>\n<br/>\n---=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has nothing to do with luck. And if the *goal* is not to watch <br/>\nTV---whatthehell???<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you say the same for reading? &quot;I have known of some children or <br/>\nadults who are just not interested in books or reading at all. What <br/>\nluck for the parents!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould THAT make sense? Would that be lauded?<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is NOT the enemy. It&#39;s just a box.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach and every one of us has the means and opportunity to watch TV all <br/>\nday. I *have* done it! Days I&#39;m not feeling well. Days that there&#39;s a <br/>\nM*A*S*H or Law & Order marathon. &lt;g&gt; But mostly it&#39;s off. It is now. I <br/>\ncould turn it on, I&#39;m CHOOSING not to. Why would I do that? Why, when I <br/>\ncan do whatever I want, am I choosing to NOT watch TV?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is, if we can accord such courtesy and respect<br/>\nto our unschooling children, that we do allow them to make mistakes<br/>\nand not critisized them for it. Why can we do the same for other<br/>\nparents?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I assume that, when someone joins an unschooling list of her <br/>\nown volition, she actually wants to understand and embrace unschooling. <br/>\nOdd assumption, maybe---but to me it makes sense. I also assume that <br/>\nall of us will/do make mistakes (we call them learning-takes). But <br/>\nstating that TV is addictive isn&#39;t a mistake. It&#39;s a belief or <br/>\nmisinformation---or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I won&#39;t let a misunderstanding of how unschooling works cloud the <br/>\nmessage of this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that we all believed we shouldn&#39;t impose our opinions,<br/>\nlikes and dislikes onto our children, why then are some of us,<br/>\nstating so strong of our disagreement of another parents point of<br/>\nview? And that to disecting, analysing and critisizing thier words/<br/>\nactions of not being able to relinquish full control and trust to<br/>\nthier child?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one has to be on this list. No one has to take our suggestions <br/>\nseriously. No one has to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re on the list in order to understand how to make <br/>\nunschooling work in *your* home, I expect you to work at it and to <br/>\nseriously consider what is being offered here. Not that I would ever <br/>\nknow what you&#39;re doing.

Or<br/>\nthat my ideas are rubbish. I get very upset seeng other parents being<br/>\ncritised because I see it as bullying, and not the &quot;constructive<br/>\ncritism&quot; as one might try to defend it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*People* aren&#39;t being criticized. Their ideas or actions *are*.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if *you* feel not good enough, that&#39;s something *you* might need to <br/>\nwork on.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Many* ideas are rubbish. The majority of the world thinks that the <br/>\nidea of unschooling is rubbish. Does that make me feel &quot;not good <br/>\nenough&quot;? Should it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t control how upset *you* get or why. I can do something about <br/>\nhow upset my own children feel if I were to turn off or limit their TV <br/>\nviewing. Or throw away their game pieces because I didn&#39;t want to put <br/>\nthem away. *YOU* can choose to help your children navigate their worlds <br/>\nOR you can navigate their worlds for them by limiting and being <br/>\nresentful of the work you must put into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me question how much freedom am I allowed to share my<br/>\nproblems, experience and beliefs on this list, without getting a<br/>\nsharp reprove?  What works for my family, might not work for another,<br/>\nbut then maybe, just maybe, my answer might be able to provide some<br/>\nbetter alternative ideas, some comfort or perhaps support.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe. But if your answer won&#39;t hold water,....<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you defend your position? Just because you have an answer, does it <br/>\nmake it a good solution? Does it fit within unschooling principles of <br/>\ntrust and respect, patience and generosity?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this means if I&#39;m not ready to release full control to my son<br/>\nwith regards to tv or anything for that matter, does that invalidate<br/>\nall these unschooling living that we&#39;ve been doing for the past 11<br/>\nmonths?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you working towards a more joyful, respectful, trusting <br/>\nrelationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing we need when appealing to this list for comfort and<br/>\nsupport, or  share &quot;well meaning&quot; non-schooling ways of doing things,<br/>\nto help further ease the burden and scary journey into &quot;letting go of<br/>\ncentral command&quot;, is being told we&#39;re not unschooling enough, or that<br/>\nwe&#39;re failing our children because of not being able to release full<br/>\ncontrol to him!

But that&#39;s not its purpose or intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to agree that TV is addictive and that it&#39;s OK for parents to <br/>\nbe resentful and vindictive, would that actually HELP someone unschool? <br/>\nHow exactly would that help? If I were to agree that arbitrary limits <br/>\nare necessary in some familes, how would that help someone ease into <br/>\nunschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s only fair that everyone is allowed to post and received<br/>\nany message, no matter how silly/ non-unschooling it is, without any<br/>\nprejudice.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might seem fair to *you*.

Conventional parenting stops at &quot;Life&#39;s hard&quot; - I <br/>\ncan&#39;t even begin to catalog the times and ways I&#39;ve heard parents <br/>\nexpress that to kids as a way to end an argument. Life&#39;s hard. No <br/>\nfree lunch. Can&#39;t always get what you want. End of story. <br/>\nUnschooling *starts* exactly there. Life&#39;s hard - so let me help <br/>\nyou. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my deschooling teen, &quot;let me help you&quot; isn&#39;t always the best <br/>\nthing to say, directly. He&#39;s not *supposed* to need help. It takes <br/>\ntime to (re)build a relationship to a place of trusting support. <br/>\nThat&#39;s true of discussion lists as well. It takes time to build <br/>\nunderstanding and trust amongst a group of complete strangers, <br/>\nespecially since most of us come to the idea of unschooling from <br/>\nsomewhere else - often from the somewhere of school where <br/>\nhelpfulness is cheating at best and a set-up for an attack at worst. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ideas I rattle on and on about is that autonomy, at least <br/>\nin unschooling jargon, is a whole different ball-game than <br/>\nindependence. Part of autonomy is trusting that help is available - <br/>\nsomething I usually talk about in terms of supporting our kids, but <br/>\nit applies to the adults on this list as well. Most of us were <br/>\nraised to respect independence and distrust help. We&#39;re okay getting <br/>\nhelp by the back door, as it were - bitching about our problems in <br/>\norder to hear others bitch and maybe grab a nugget or two of useful <br/>\ninformation. Part of deschooling involves developing our own <br/>\nautonomy as parents. Being okay with saying &quot;I need some help here&quot; -<br/>\n to our spouses, friends, kids... and other unschoolers. Seeing help <br/>\nbeing offered, rather than critcism. Seeing good intentions. Those <br/>\nare some of the unschooling skills that take time and practice to <br/>\nlearn. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first came to unschooling lists I got my feelings hurt alot. <br/>\nI expected criticism, so I read every difference as an attack. I <br/>\nexpected a bitchy old-girl system and felt slapped around. I <br/>\nexpected to be graded on my performance as an unschooling parent and <br/>\nfelt like I was getting a D at best. It&#39;s interesting to me to look <br/>\nback at some of the same comments that offended and scared me a few <br/>\nyears ago and see the kindness being offered. It took some <br/>\ndeschooling on my part to be able to see that kindness - much as it <br/>\nhas taken some deschooling on my stepson&#39;s part to be able to see <br/>\n*my* kindness. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this has turned into something of a ramble, but I wanted to <br/>\nsay that in many many ways, the same principles we&#39;re trying to <br/>\napply in our families *do* come out on this board.

The practices are like balloons that support  <br/>\ntheir fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a  <br/>\nbottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>\nself examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>\nlist is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just  <br/>\nnot seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people decide to let go, when they bring a practice to the list  <br/>\nthat they want help with, it isn&#39;t because it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s because  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been examining that practice in a new light and they don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike the new vision. The new vision makes them more uncomfortable  <br/>\nthan the fear. One of their balloons doesn&#39;t look so comforting any  <br/>\nmore. They were only seeing the balloon part of the practice that was  <br/>\nholding them up and supporting their fears, but now they&#39;ve seen the  <br/>\nlead part that was weighing down their kids and holding themselves  <br/>\nback. They&#39;ve reached the point with that practice where they&#39;ve  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s scary to let go, but I can now see that where this  <br/>\nballoon is taking me is even scarier.

You don&#39;t like the  <br/>\nconsequences (they *are* temporary consequences!) of letting him have  <br/>\nall the screen time he&#39;d like. So you are *choosing* to limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is one piece of advice I could give people it would be to  <br/>\nsee everything they do as a choice. It is so incredibly freeing :-)  <br/>\nIt seems like the only reason we do so many unpleasant things in life  <br/>\nis because we don&#39;t have a choice. But it&#39;s the perception of not  <br/>\nhaving a choice makes them doubly onerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, I hated cleaning the toilet. It was just something you  <br/>\nhad to do every week (or month ;-) And just because I had to do it, I  <br/>\nnever wanted to and fought against it, often avoiding my  <br/>\nresponsibility for 6 months! But when I realized it was a choice,  <br/>\nthat I could choose to never ever ever scrub the toilet again, I  <br/>\nrealized that it was nice to see it not filthy. I could choose� when  <br/>\nI wanted to!�to have a clean toilet. And I found that once I realized  <br/>\nthere wasn&#39;t anyone making me clean, that I cleaned it a lot more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to let him have all the screen time he&#39;d like I promise  <br/>\nyou it will be hard! It will be hard to make the decision. It will be  <br/>\nhard on you to let go of control over a piece of your life. It will  <br/>\nbe hard to see the new problems letting go creates. But the place on  <br/>\nthe other side on beyond this transition period where your son sees  <br/>\nscreen time as just another thing to do and not something precious to  <br/>\nbe coveted is a really awesome place :-) And it will be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s something  <br/>\nbetter, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house and feel  <br/>\nthat tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to prevent  <br/>\nsomething that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only then will  <br/>\nyou be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to the list and  <br/>\nsays &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this group is open enough for me to be able to admit that  <br/>\nwithout serious accusations of being inadequate or such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be the crux of the difficulties people have with this  <br/>\ntype of list. Many people want places to vent, where they can air  <br/>\ntheir faults and have others say &quot;Yes, I have that exact same  <br/>\nproblem. I know what you&#39;re going through because I&#39;m going through  <br/>\nthe same thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what support lists are for :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a discussion list. It&#39;s a place to work out the things you&#39;ve  <br/>\ndecided to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are two types of people: People who want to work out  <br/>\ntheir problems in private while getting support for how hard it is.  <br/>\nAnd people who recognize that not being perfect is part of life and  <br/>\nwant a place to work on being better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if it&#39;s personality or school that causes people to think  <br/>\nthey&#39;re bad for not doing everything right? Probably personality but  <br/>\nthen school makes it worse :-/ But no one on the list sees anyone as  <br/>\nbad for not doing everything &quot;right&quot;. No one expects everyone to be  <br/>\ndoing everything &quot;right&quot;. Because there isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; so much as  <br/>\nthere is actively working towards better, or moving towards  <br/>\nunschooling instead of away.

It&#39;s the next  <br/>\nstep beyond &quot;Life&#39;s hard.&quot; That&#39;s why there isn&#39;t much support for  <br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s hard,&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; This type of list is the place to go when  <br/>\nyou want to ask &quot;So what do I do about that? How do I make it less  <br/>\nhard.

It&#39;s help to move on! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is just not a support list where people can post about how  <br/>\nhard life is and sympathize with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, life&#39;s hard.

They helped <br/>\ncreate more ease in our house about those activities.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Robbin, <br/>\n<br/>\nI found the same thing when we first started unschooling (about 3 <br/>\nyears ago)...reading other people&#39;s experiences, thoughts and ideas <br/>\nhelped us to get where we are today. I can&#39;t imagine getting here <br/>\nwithout people like Pam S. & Joyce...also Sandra. Reading about how <br/>\nthey did it gave me ideas on how to incorporate more and more of <br/>\nthat kind of parenting into my own family. After all, that&#39;s why I <br/>\nwas there (the message boards at unschooling.com that is - which is <br/>\nno longer there by the way).....because I wanted a change for my <br/>\nfamily and in my case, (and I suspect many of you) it had to start <br/>\nwith me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I wonder if there are readers lurking on this list who do not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have much screen time in their homes. What does that look like for <br/>\nyou?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s probably a good deal of members who don&#39;t have much screen <br/>\ntime because they don&#39;t own a TV (or fill in your screen-of-choice). <br/>\nI know I sometimes take for granted that everybody has a computer <br/>\n(or three like us), gaming systems, TV, DVD, VCR, etc. I feel <br/>\nfortunate that we have these things because they add to our lives, <br/>\nas do many of the things we own and are able to use.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, there are members who own those things, but they&#39;re <br/>\nchildren really aren&#39;t interested in them. We have Playstation 2 and <br/>\na ton of games and my daughters (( & 12) have gone weeks without <br/>\nplaying. Right now, a matter of fact, Shawna is sitting next to me <br/>\nplaying Spyro and trying to get past a level. She&#39;s played more <br/>\ntoday (about 2.5 hours and counting) than she has all month. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as I read in some of the posts, there are some that limit <br/>\ntheir children screen time. I would suggest to those members that <br/>\nyou read more about the experiences of those who have let go of <br/>\ncontrol and rules and replaced it with discussions, involvement, <br/>\ntrust, modeling, respect, etc. I really think that is the key to <br/>\nunderstanding unschooling. When you remove what used to be there, <br/>\nreplace it with something else, something different, something <br/>\nbetter. When we first started unschooling (maybe after about 6 <br/>\nmonths or so) I quickly noticed with Shawna that when ever I fell <br/>\ninto a routine (I would notice it after about 2-3 days) of not <br/>\nconsistantly connecting with her and being involved in what she was <br/>\ninterested in, she would start to slowly fall apart. It wasn&#39;t that <br/>\nthe rules had to be put back in place - it was that I had to get <br/>\ninvolved again. Sure, there are times we&#39;re all off and doing our <br/>\nown thing (my kids are 9, 12 & 15) but I don&#39;t let time go by with <br/>\nout connecting and talking and interacting. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** Joanne ***<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274177100,"authorName":"Vickisue Gray","from":"Vickisue Gray &lt;vickisue_gray@...&gt;","profile":"vickisue_gray","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: OT - Any non-screen households on this list","postDate":"1193672294","msgId":27417,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2NzA0LjE5MzI5LnFtQHdlYjU0MTA4Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":27413,"nextInTopic":27420,"prevInTime":27416,"nextInTime":27418,"topicId":27345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"((((APPLAUD)))) Very nicely stated, Ren.

It&#39;s not so easy to find people that will point out<br/>\nways to be MORE respectful to children and their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list has existed for over three years and has almost 1700<br/>\nmembers. No two people here do things exactly alike. Everyone is at a<br/>\nvery different place in their own journey. Nobody expects anyone to be<br/>\nanywhere other than where they ARE right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really thankful for this place where mainstream ideas are<br/>\nchallenged, where we can all talk about ways to respect children MORE,<br/>\nnot less. I&#39;m thankful this list stays true to it&#39;s purpose which is<br/>\nhelping people understand the environment unschooling will blossom in<br/>\nbest. I&#39;m thankful for the many voices that contribute, question and<br/>\nespecially for those that (year after year after year) answer<br/>\nquestions and help people see there are better options than control<br/>\nand limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I would ever have fully understood the idea of<br/>\npartnering with my children had nobody come along and challenged me to<br/>\nstretch and grow.

Like many post before, I&#39;ve noticed <br/>\nparents with good intentions posting thier advice and opinion, gets <br/>\ncritisized for non &quot;unschooling&quot; praticises.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe origin of this topic, I assumed was someone asking for support <br/>\nfrom other unschooling non-screen families, and perhaps wanting a <br/>\nbetter insight of these families work around thier tv issues and a <br/>\nlittle bit of support. And many did reply, offering scenarios of <br/>\nthier approach to tv, some are very suportive of tv, some not so, <br/>\nwhich was great, because now the person have a wide choice of options <br/>\nto mull about. For those of us who is supportive of tv, I suppose we <br/>\nwould all love to &quot;share&quot; our joy in finding the freedom and benefit <br/>\nof tv watching. And for a non-screen parent to offer some insights of <br/>\nhow thier &quot;limited screen time&quot; work in thier lives, it is offered in <br/>\ngood faith.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for anyone to start critising <br/>\nthem, for what they believe. I&#39;ve re-read the post many times, and in <br/>\nno way did sharilynn29 above said or implied we &quot;tv believing&quot; <br/>\nparents is wrong and failing our children. She believes in what she <br/>\nconstitudes to be addictive behaviour in her children, and is doing <br/>\nwhat she believes is best for her children. But that doeasn&#39;t mean <br/>\nshe felt we &quot;tv believing parents&quot; was irreponsible to allow our <br/>\nchildren to be tv- addict zombie. I don&#39;t think anybody should take <br/>\nit as a personal insult! She was merely stating what she believes is <br/>\nworking for them. (How and why, we won&#39;t know because we are not part <br/>\nof her family). And that to her the tv can invoke the addicitive <br/>\nelement, in her and her children and she&#39;s found a way to balance <br/>\nthat.  And this is possible. I have known of some children or adults <br/>\nwho&#39;s just not interested in tvs or pc at all, what luck for the <br/>\nparents!! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is, if we can accord such courtesy and respect <br/>\nto our unschooling children, that we do allow them to make mistakes <br/>\nand not critisized them for it. Why can we do the same for other <br/>\nparents? And that we all believed we shouldn&#39;t impose our opinions, <br/>\nlikes and dislikes onto our children, why then are some of us, <br/>\nstating so strong of our disagreement of another parents point of <br/>\nview? And that to disecting, analysing and critisizing thier words/ <br/>\nactions of not being able to relinquish full control and trust to <br/>\nthier child? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDescription of the frnt page of Unschoolingbasics. <br/>\n &quot;A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask <br/>\nexperienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out <br/>\nhow unschooling works in real families.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin <br/>\nor what an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you <br/>\nto discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural <br/>\nlearning and how it affects our entire lives. From parenting issues <br/>\nto learning from the whole wide world and beyond, come explore the <br/>\nissues that unschooling families have dealt with in the past and how <br/>\nto get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling lifestyle&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNowhere did it say, if you&#39;re not 100% unschooling, you&#39;re not <br/>\nwelcome. Nowhere did it say, if you&#39;re still unsure about going 100% <br/>\nunschooling, your non-unschooling ideas that worked for you, might <br/>\nget critised. Is it right that I should worry about sharing some of <br/>\nmy experience or post my ignorant non -unschooling opinions, and face <br/>\nthe possibility of being critized? I do get very upset if I&#39;m <br/>\ncritised because it&#39;s basically telling me I&#39;m not good enough. Or <br/>\nthat my ideas are rubbish. I get very upset seeng other parents being <br/>\ncritised because I see it as bullying, and not the &quot;constructive <br/>\ncritism&quot; as one might try to defend it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me question how much freedom am I allowed to share my <br/>\nproblems, experience and beliefs on this list, without getting a <br/>\nsharp reprove?  What works for my family, might not work for another, <br/>\nbut then maybe, just maybe, my answer might be able to provide some <br/>\nbetter alternative ideas, some comfort or perhaps support.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this means if I&#39;m not ready to release full control to my son <br/>\nwith regards to tv or anything for that matter, does that invalidate <br/>\nall these unschooling living that we&#39;ve been doing for the past 11 <br/>\nmonths? <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe it is thru all our differences replies, with our many <br/>\ndifferent views and different comfort level of unschooling, with our <br/>\nmany different ways of releasing trust to our children, is what <br/>\nallows us all to learnt more, off each other. And it is possible some <br/>\nfamilies have unschool so well that they do not feel they have <br/>\nanything more to learnt off others. But yet, it is thru all these <br/>\ndfferent stories of unschooling, some of you a &quot;successful&quot; 110%, <br/>\nsome a &quot;almost there&quot; 70%, some &quot;a confident and picking up speed&quot; <br/>\n50% and some maybe just &quot;a slow and still uncertain&quot; 30%, that help <br/>\nmany of us to push forth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing we need when appealing to this list for comfort and <br/>\nsupport, or  share &quot;well meaning&quot; non-schooling ways of doing things, <br/>\nto help further ease the burden and scary journey into &quot;letting go of <br/>\ncentral command&quot;, is being told we&#39;re not unschooling enough, or that <br/>\nwe&#39;re failing our children because of not being able to release full <br/>\ncontrol to him! What a slap to the face and confidence! <br/>\n <br/>\nThe fact that some of us is accessing this list, is proving enough <br/>\nthat we all want to unschool successfully, and is trying our bestest <br/>\nto improve and  undo all our bad parenting habit, by constantly try <br/>\nto find ways that doesn&#39;t spook us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s only fair that everyone is allowed to post and received <br/>\nany message, no matter how silly/ non-unschooling it is, without any <br/>\nprejudice. And that we are allowed the full freedom and the trust <br/>\nthat we will know what&#39;s best for our children and will eventually <br/>\nlearn to let go, slow but surely. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently helping a friend (a very traditional, no tv, no <br/>\ngamebox person) and her 9 yr old to unschool. And I very frequently <br/>\ntells her it&#39;s ok and it&#39;s not the end of the world if she&#39;s chickens <br/>\nout of relinquishing certain control back to her very active son, who <br/>\nhappens to be de-schooling big time with lots of gamebox, swearing <br/>\nand shouting. And that it&#39;s ok to only give a tiny bit of control to <br/>\nthe son and not alot, if that&#39;s what&#39;s she&#39;s comfrotable doing, for a <br/>\nstart. I very often points it out to her, that it&#39;s she who&#39;s having <br/>\na bad time de-schooling/ unschooling, and not her son. That she&#39;s the <br/>\none, who&#39;s scared, and not her son. And that she really wants to <br/>\nunschool because she&#39;s convinced it is for better, but yet, she&#39;s <br/>\nfnding it very very scary and hard. My words to her is &quot;Don&#39;t be hard <br/>\non yourself. You can&#39;t do everything in one day. When you&#39;re ready, <br/>\nyou will let go quite willingly, painlessly, and confidently.&quot; Never <br/>\ndid I once critised her for hanging onto the 1 hour tv limit and the <br/>\n1 hour gamebox playing, despite I could see how hard her son was <br/>\nrebelling against the limit. It&#39;s not my family nor my life to judge. <br/>\nThe only thing I could offer her was the constantly insight into our <br/>\nlife with my son&#39;s fulltime attachement to the online Disney <br/>\ncommunity and tv. And of course, to assured her that she&#39;s not a bad <br/>\nmum, just because she couldn&#39;t do what I&#39;m doing. Infact, she&#39;s a <br/>\nvery very good and brave mum, to attempt something that she couldn&#39;t <br/>\neven possibly contemplate doing 2 months ago. And that&#39;s to unschool, <br/>\nfor her son. And that most of we unschoolers all start off <br/>\nunschooling, feeling very very worried and very very unsure of <br/>\nourselves, and the only sure thing is that we all know we&#39;re doing <br/>\nthis for the best of our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Best Regrds to all,<br/>\nSharonC</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274933479,"authorName":"sharon currie","from":"sharon currie &lt;lyeping2607@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2607","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Any non-screen households on this list?","postDate":"1193653898","msgId":27409,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMTg0MC4yNjA4Ny5xbUB3ZWIyNzMxMC5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27389,"nextInTopic":27410,"prevInTime":27408,"nextInTime":27410,"topicId":27345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well said Tina.

We now have a PS2 and cable. Now that the tv is not a scarce resource, my zombies are coming back to life. We go days without turning on the television just <br/>\nbecause we have better things to do -- like cutting bamboo, walking to <br/>\nthe library, going to the zoo/park/museum, reading, or seeing just how <br/>\nbig of a mess can be made in the bedroom. Most days we&#39;re just too <br/>\nbusy to turn on the tv.&quot;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I can totally understand how some parents still cannot see tv as a learning tool, but rather tv is seen more like as a form of entertainment instead. Yes, I supposed being addicted to entertainment can be bad, especially when you&#39;re too busy having fun, not learning all those necessary survival skills of readng writing or maths or cooking or exercising our body. But I would like to say, have a think about this. When they grow up, will they get stuck in front of a tv, when they are at a friends place, when they are 15 or 16 yrs old, when you are no longer to monitor/ control them? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My answer is always &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Therefore, no reason to control/ monitor  him now, as I want to be sure that all the decisions that my son makes, from now onwards, is his own. I do not want surprises when he&#39;s 15, where he&#39;s might do a total &quot;flip&quot;, just like all my friends teenage kids&#39; done. Why the surprise? That&#39;s because when they are teen, they all of a sudden realised they have a choice, the choice to listen to mum/ dad, or the choice to follow thier heart. Naturally the heart  always wins. Which explains the moans of &quot;they are not doing what they always do;  this is so unlike them;  I don&#39;t know why he has changed&quot; &quot;they won&#39;t listen!&quot; . That&#39;s because &quot;what they always do&quot;, is not thier choice but merely the adults (parents, relatives, society). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So what are you going to do then, when they suddenly wouldn&#39;t bulge from the tv and they are too big for you to sent to thier room? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sometimes, it&#39;s worth considering the option to just &quot;let go&quot; and surrender to it? Then the  &quot;fear of addiction for electronic media being bad for our children&quot; will simply melt away. It can be a very scary, giving in to something that is so very alien, so bad. But you have to look forward, and think of the scenario/ environment your children will be living in. Electronic is becoming more and more involved in our life. Even Sony PSP is being introduced as a value-enhancing educating tool in school. In Maths, learning about the calculator is a legit topic on it&#39;s own! I bet when it first came out, it was considered evil too.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I know some of us might argue that a calculator screen cannot be compared to a tv screen. Why not? Well for one, it doeans&#39;t entertain. And it hasn&#39;t got a big screen, spewing out all those zombifying coloured pixels. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ah....nevertheless, coloured screen or not, the calculator is still after all &quot;a medium of easy access to information&quot; without our brain having to work hard. A short cut that only required our eyes and fingers. And it doesn&#39;t requires the conversation (but yet it can ceate conversations/ discussions opportunities, just like the tv) With a calculator, we learnt of the maths answer without having to stretch our brains, just the same as the tv, an easy source of information with having to rake thru an encyclopedia. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Isn&#39;t this bad for the brain? It&#39;ll just zombiefied them? Not at all, on contrary, I believe my son&#39;s brain is working even faster when he&#39;s watching any screen, because his brain is busy absorbing, making sense, cross referencing info and storing for later use. This is evident because very often, discussions can be strike-up about a certain scenario we watched on the tv, liinking it to another similar life situation.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I just think any electronic media be it tv or pc or calculator allows faster learning, leaving my child more time to do other things. In a way, it&#39;s like &quot;better time management&quot;. Having to utilised the minimal time resources for maximum gain of knowledge, leaves him more time to concentrate on harder things that cannot be achieved via the tv or pc. Like jumping on the trampoline, gardening, running around like a mad cave man, painting, or playing with toys, which will eventually happen, when his brain had enough and would like to take &quot;a break from learning&quot;.      <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  SharonC<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

What is appropriate for<br/>\na teen is not necessarily right for a 2 yr old.  (Just like quantity<br/>\nof food -- if you have a teenaged boy, you know that they eat a LOT<br/>\nmore food than any toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen ds was very young, and all the neighbors were plopping their kids<br/>\nin front of Sesame Street and Barney, I was playing with my ds.  We<br/>\nturned S.S. on once, for about 2-3 minutes.  They started out with a<br/>\nnice, gentle segment showing African animals -- got his attention. <br/>\nBut all too soon, they went to baby-MTV mode, flashing this and that<br/>\nso fast.  I think it is well designed to shorten attention spans, not<br/>\nwhat I wanted for ds.  Besides, he didn&#39;t like the flashy bit -- he<br/>\nwas a study-and-absorb kind of tot.  He walked away, I turned off the<br/>\ntube, and we never tried Sesame Street again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was about 2, in February, he came down with a cold, and was<br/>\nlistless, and asked to watch the Grinch.  So, in February, we watched<br/>\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas several times.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe taped the Shining Time Station stuff and edited out the idiocy, and<br/>\njust watched the Thomas the Tank Engine stuff -- he was a Thomas fan,<br/>\nwe had all the books, etc.  Again, this wasn&#39;t a huge part of his<br/>\nlife.  And -- we watched together.  I don&#39;t recall ever using the tv<br/>\nas an electronic babysitter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut much of what dh and I watched was, at the time, too intense for<br/>\nour sensitive guy.  So we time-shifted with the vcr, and watched while<br/>\nds slept.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he got older, though, there were things we were eager to share with<br/>\nhim, such as Star Trek.  (That was a lot later, btw, because, well, he<br/>\nwas so sensitive, and freaked at it at a much later age than many kids<br/>\nthese days.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we watch a fair amount, but still as a family.  We find it<br/>\nenjoyable together time, and often discuss the shows.  (Generally,<br/>\nthey are taped ahead of time, so we can skip commercials.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other screen -- the computer -- we didn&#39;t officially limit, but it<br/>\nwas fairly self-limiting when he was young.  We didn&#39;t use a lot of<br/>\nkiddie software, so it held little attraction.  DS was active, and had<br/>\nlots to occupy himself without the screen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he got older, I occasionally imposed a computer restriction when I<br/>\nsaw it adversely affecting his behavior.  The usual reaction was, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nbored...&quot;  then -- a burst of creativity in many diverse areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never had official time limits on hours/day or whatever.  Now,<br/>\nds wants to be a programmer, preferably game programmer.  Obviously,<br/>\nhe needs the &#39;puter to make his games.  The ONLY restriction we have<br/>\nis on Runescape.  And the way we set it up is we essentially gave him<br/>\na time budget -- so many hours/month, so many per year.  He has a log<br/>\nsheet to help keep track.  He agreed that it was fair (and we had a<br/>\npretty generous &quot;income&quot; of time for him.)  Since we instituted the<br/>\nbudget system, things got back into balance.  We didn&#39;t want to cut<br/>\nhim off cold turkey -- forbidden fruit always tastes so sweet.  But it<br/>\nwas making him off-balanced, and I think, if you asked him, he might<br/>\nagree.  (He currently is away at a scout volunteer activity, so I<br/>\ncan&#39;t ask him now.)  Does he play a fair amount of Runescape still --<br/>\nyup.  But he spends as much or more time on the &#39;puter working on his<br/>\ngames - graphics, scripting, that sort of thing.  (And, as an added<br/>\nbenefit, his knowledge of graphics is much better than mine, and he<br/>\nwas able to help me figure out a solution to importing pdf files into<br/>\nPublisher for my newsletter.  I love it when kids see the real value<br/>\nto their efforts.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you weren&#39;t looking for this level of detailed response!

If their  <br/>\ninterests include tv-watching, then far from restricting them,  <br/>\ninstead, I supported that interest. I did that by enthusiastically  <br/>\nwatching with them, playing tv-show based games online or as  <br/>\nvideogames, getting tv-based hands-on games and toys and puzzles,  <br/>\nnoticing when there might be a &quot;special&quot; on tv they&#39;d want to watch,  <br/>\nnoticing which shows they really liked and finding all kinds of tie- <br/>\nins (use Google to look for all kinds of things related to their  <br/>\nfavorite tv shows), bring up things happening in their favorite shows  <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re having conversations about other things, dress up like  <br/>\nthe tv show characters for Halloween or just for fun anytime, get  <br/>\nbooks and coloring books and activity books that are related, BUYING  <br/>\nwhole seasons of their favorite shows, getting cd&#39;s of the music from  <br/>\ntheir shows, getting books based on the shows or on which the shows  <br/>\nare based, AND finding creative ways of extending some of the  <br/>\ninevitable connections that every show brings up.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe sometimes people really just can&#39;t imagine how to respond to tv  <br/>\nin a way more consistent with showing the deep underlying trust in  <br/>\nour children on which unschooling is based.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those restricting tv, maybe just try this as an experiment. Next  <br/>\ntime you have the urge to make them turn it off, instead, look for a  <br/>\nway to support their interest and enrich their lives. A simple and  <br/>\nobvious way is to go cuddle up with them and enjoy watching together.  <br/>\nAsk questions, get involved. Maybe join them with a cup of cocoa and  <br/>\nsome cookies. Or get online and look for connections to offer. Choose  <br/>\nyour time - don&#39;t interrupt, but in between shows you can say, &quot;Oh,  <br/>\nlook, I found these Sponge Bob coloring pages for you and I brought  <br/>\nyou some crayons, if you&#39;re interested.&quot; And, talk about the show,  <br/>\n&quot;Did you know that the guy who made up SpongeBob is a real marine  <br/>\nbiologist?&quot; Or, &quot;I wonder why he didn&#39;t make SpongeBob look more like  <br/>\na real sea sponge? I mean, he looks like a kitchen sponge.&quot; (You can  <br/>\nbuy a piece of sea sponge at a craft store or in paint dept of Home  <br/>\nDepot - get some and have fun sponge painting with it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDecide to take that moment to SHOW you honor and support their  <br/>\nchoices. I wish I could get across to parents of younger children how  <br/>\nVERY wonderful it will be for you when your kids are teens if you  <br/>\nhave created that atmosphere of real trust. Don&#39;t you want to end up  <br/>\nwith teens who live up to that confidence you&#39;ve shown in them? You  <br/>\nundermine it every time you show your lack of trust - every time you  <br/>\narbitrarily restrict tv you are telling them, &quot;I don&#39;t trust you to  <br/>\nknow what&#39;s good for you.&quot; Instead, start from the beginning saying,  <br/>\n&quot;I trust your choices and will support them.&quot; This is not trivial;  <br/>\nthis is building the relationship you will have in a few years and  <br/>\nduring a time of life when most parents lose that closeness and  <br/>\nhonesty and confidence in their own teens. If you restrict tv now,  <br/>\nwill you try to restrict them from the things they want when they are  <br/>\nteens, too? It won&#39;t work and everyone knows it, but parents don&#39;t  <br/>\nknow what else to do. They act like they can control their teenagers,  <br/>\nbut that is so obviously not true, teens whose parents are  <br/>\nrestrictive will often put themselves in much more risky situations  <br/>\nthan otherwise. Start trusting them now if that is the relationship  <br/>\nyou hope to have when they are teens. You can&#39;t just manufacture it  <br/>\nlater, it is built on years of showing trust and confidence and  <br/>\nsupport of their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":314099889,"authorName":"Jamie Murray","from":"&quot;Jamie Murray&quot; &lt;CAHOLO@...&gt;","profile":"calicomama2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Any non-screen households on this list?","postDate":"1193498414","msgId":27385,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYWMwMWM4MThhYyRlMDc4OTZlMCQwN2IwYjk0M0Boc2QxLndhLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGZmdmpvbCtnZHEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27378,"nextInTopic":27389,"prevInTime":27384,"nextInTime":27386,"topicId":27345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I use the TV and the computer as a means for my son to learn.

My son loves to watch PBS sprout.  Although, the TV maybe on 24/7 pratically, my son doesn&#39;t watch TV most of the time.  But he&#39;s found ways to play, watch TV, learn, and other activities at his own pace and time.  I let him decide when and what to do.  Only structure we have is meals and sleeping schedules and even those have been known to change slightly from time to time.  My son loves to learn.  He&#39;s not even 4 yrs old yet, and he knows quite a bit more than the average child.  We are currently in the process of learning to read.  He knows his letters, knows some short words and his name.  He&#39;s even has done a type of exercise program to the TV.  He loves the care bears and one of his care bear videos has an exercise video.  Not all may agree with allowing him the freedom he has, altho, he can be quite busy most of the time.  Just curious, how does one deal with trying to homeschool and babysitting most of the day?  I feel we haven&#39;t done much the last couple weeks, since I started to babysit another little boy that&#39;s my son&#39;s age.  Most of the time it feels like they are playing and and even fighting.  I&#39;ve lost count on them hitting and bitting.  Which seems to be something that&#39;s getting better, but I still deal with it everyday (M-F).  <br/>\n<br/>\nJamie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, October 27, 2007 7:59 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Any non-screen households on this list?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~~Some would say that I don&#39;t follow the unschooling philosophy, but I<br/>\n  try to protect my kids from the addictive nature of video games.
