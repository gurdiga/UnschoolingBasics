I don&#39;t know why diffusing the situations before their crazed didn&#39;t come to mind.  I think I recognize the feeling of the frenzy started but I miss the cue that would keep it from a full scale tidal wave...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Some of our &quot;problem&quot; is that we have 2 1/2 year olds - 6 year olds in our pre-school.  Unfortunately sometimes my 5 or 6 year olds can almost be more disruptive than a 2 1/2 year old. Or at least I expect more from my 5 year olds than my 3 year olds!! My director and I have talked about separating these children but it never happens.    Anyway,  I try apply the lessons and such to all of them (just like I would if I was in a class room full of 5 year olds that all have different learning abilities..)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  That leads me to another thought.  One of my other co-workers boys is usually there for our pre-school than has to go off to another..  Her childs teacher practically said that her child is acting like he does in her classroom because of our pre-school/daycare setting.  This is my thoughts.. at the day care her child is learning to play with all ages and I don&#39;t put in constraints when it comes to &#39;testing&#39;....  So to me if one 4 year old can recognize and say the alphabet great !! but if another one says the alphabet but doesn&#39;t recognize the letters well that great too...!!! (thanks to unschoolers helping me to recognize that all children will learn at their own pace) Sure at times I am surprised when a 4 year old can&#39;t use scissors but......  have to catch myself here and realize it is all good1! <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Oh and on your thought on tools we do have quite a few games to use like shape, alphabet, number bingo and such.  And when it comes to &quot;math&quot; I try to make it game like and copy lots of creative ideas from the internet and books out there for different play centers.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Heck the more I write you folks I realize that I can do this... I just need to keep using tools and finding ways to make it fun...I think I do what you said and actually ask the kids which things they like best.... I have found out already they really love music. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Peters &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julieannpeters@...\">julieannpeters@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I&#39;ve got some suggestions for you...my DH and I used to <br/>\nhave &quot;bus/cafeteria duty&quot; for one of our church&#39;s kids ministries, <br/>\nwe are Cub Scout leaders, and have had kids in PS while trying to <br/>\nunschool at home...needless to say, unschooling is just easier if <br/>\nyou are not exposing them to 2 different standards on a daily <br/>\nbasis.

Thank you for your thoughts.  I will definitely look at how to find calm the waters before they escalate.  Unfortanately, my director isn&#39;t very good at this either.  However, I think  I&#39;m on the verge of figuring out a couple of things.   Yesterday, our fellow co-worker let the pre-school and he was so laid back that I think the kids followed suit.  And one thing he said is that he knows I worry about this and that and especially what my director/boss wants/says and he doesn&#39;t.... Sooo... maybe if I just learn to tune out any other thoughts except the fun we can have learning and what I have on the agenda...???  Anyway this is my very first year teaching beyond substitute teaching  and student teaching.  I guessing that I would have to go through some of this whether I had some unschooling thoughts or not.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I do understand it is my directors pre-school/daycare and she can run it any way she would like --- however she isn&#39;t very consistant --- oh well-- I&#39;ll just keep trucking along and keep finding a common ground with her -- and keep striving for a peaceful day. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  You had mentioned to observe someone else that exudes calm == however, that isn&#39;t my boss either/// but when she had another day care she said her girl over there was great at keeping the kids calm.  Hopefully I can pop over to that day care and watch her for a few hours///??  Again thanks  for the input ...

Be aware of what  <br/>\ndynamic leads to hitting and change it and defuse it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re getting loud then you need to change the dynamic before  <br/>\nthey get to the point where you need to raise your voice. It&#39;s a  <br/>\nspecial skill that I know I don&#39;t have ;-) but I know some people are  <br/>\nable to sense what to do and which child to go to to change the dynamic.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to figure out how to calm the waters before they reach  <br/>\ntsunami proportions. That doesn&#39;t mean shushing them all the time. It  <br/>\nmeans redirecting energy that&#39;s building up. You could ask your  <br/>\ndirector or another teacher who seems to be able to exude calm into  <br/>\nthe room.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think you can do unschooling in a room full of kids who  <br/>\nare used to being controlled. Even at home when someone&#39;s starting  <br/>\nout unschooling parenting, it&#39;s common for kids to go wild when  <br/>\ncontrols are removed until they figure out the new way things work.  <br/>\n(And it&#39;s why we suggest not removing all the controls at once and  <br/>\njust saying &quot;yes&quot; more.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids you have are probably controlled at home. If they come to  <br/>\nschool where it feels like control is a little iffy, they *will* go  <br/>\nwild and *will* test boundaries. It&#39;s what control does to kids. It&#39;s  <br/>\nlike school kids on a field trip. A goodly proportion are loud and  <br/>\nthey push boundaries when they&#39;re out of school. If you had full  <br/>\nfreedom at the preschool to help them understand what freedom feels  <br/>\nlike, and had a good sense of how to work the dynamic of a room, it  <br/>\ncould work, but being wishy washy on control is a recipe for disaster  <br/>\nI think.

I don&#39;t write much because I <br/>\nam just a newbee to this whole realm. I am writing because I just <br/>\nneed to vent/talk to those who may understand my frustration. <br/>\nHere&#39;s my thoughts.... .<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I work at a daycare as a pre-school teacher and luckily I get <br/>\nto take my two children with me (4 and 1&gt;) However, it is so <br/>\ndifficult to strive to live one way (unschooling, consensual, etc) <br/>\nwith my children but have to work where I have to follow &quot;schooling&quot; <br/>\nideas and such... So what I need help with is advice on how to turn <br/>\nmy thoughts into a more positive aspect and possibly throw a little <br/>\nunschooling in my pre-school.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s one dilemma -- unfortunately I have to follow the typical pre-<br/>\nschool routine where we cover the days of week, letter, and numbers <br/>\netc and unfortunately my boss wants me to still do flash cards --- <br/>\nyuck. I feel like we can use them once a week but more than that ---<br/>\nboring... I like to get the letters in my using them, plain all <br/>\ncoping/tracing them, and making cool crafts that entail letters and <br/>\nnumbers etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, she is pretty typical in &#39;discipline&#39; -- she wants them <br/>\nquieter than I would expect in turn that makes me always trying to <br/>\nkeep the quiet. She made a comment today that basically said that <br/>\nthey were great kids the two days I was off -- but seemed antsy, <br/>\nlouder, etc when I&#39;ve been there (let&#39;s not take into consideration <br/>\nthat today we had a easter party??!!). Now I agree that sometimes I <br/>\ncan be on edge and snappier with the kids by I am constantly <br/>\nstriving to make there environment fun and safe. I always try not <br/>\nto yell however sometimes when the whole group is crazed and just <br/>\ndon&#39;t hear me when I&#39;ve talked at a lower tone or normal voice I <br/>\nwill raise mine so they can hear me. (again boss doesn&#39;t like me to <br/>\nyell -- and neither do I but I&#39;m not sure what to do to get their <br/>\nattention -- ideas??) Basically -- dilemma is how to get the kids <br/>\ncalmed down and listen without yelling, having to sit them down <br/>\nphyscially, or give any type of time outs???&gt;??? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow at home I try to let my child live more freely, make choices, <br/>\nbut living between these two worlds I have to often refer back to <br/>\nsome of your ideas her at unschooling basics...
