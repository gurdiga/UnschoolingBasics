But if you can get over that  I recommend &quot;Billy  Elliott&quot; which is about <br/>\na striking coalminer&#39;s son that is born to be a  dancer.....great movie.  <br/>\nAlso, &quot;Impromptu&quot;, the story of Chopin&#39;s (early  Hugh Grant) affair with the <br/>\nfemale writer Georges Sands (nom de plume). I  haven&#39;t seen it for awhile, so I <br/>\ncan&#39;t remember anything to be aware  of.   And &quot;Room with a View&quot; (no f-word but <br/>\nfull frontal male nudity  when the men go for a swim).  It has Maggie Smith, <br/>\na.k.a. Professor  McGonnigal!  In a way, a great unschooling movie as it about <br/>\nliving with  passion and being true to oneself.<br/>\n <br/>\nI still haven&#39;t seen the Ice Storm, will put that on my Netflix  queue!<br/>\n <br/>\nHave fun!

My name is Paige Parr, and my family and I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1666772264\">Hi, group!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve posted here a handful of times, but I&#39;ve yet to offer <br/>\na &quot;formal&quot; intro (my bad!), so here we go!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Paige Parr, and my family and I live and learn and laugh <br/>\nand love in the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia <br/>\n(specifically, Waynesboro VA...about 30 min. from Charlottesville).  <br/>\nI&#39;m mom to four amazing girls:  Shelby (12), Tori (7), Ashlyn (6), <br/>\nand Loryn (aka Lolo, 3).  My two younger girls have been diagnosed <br/>\nwith autism.  Ashlyn&#39;s diagnosis was the main reason I held off on <br/>\nunschooling...I just thought it wasn&#39;t possible to unschool with <br/>\nkids on the spectrum...everyone I spoke with about autism, every <br/>\nbook I read on the subject, stressed the need for structure:  <br/>\nstructured school time, structured &quot;playtime&quot; (WHAT?), meals, <br/>\nbedtimes, etc.  To me, unschooling equaled FREEDOM, and every <br/>\nresource I stumbled across stressed that &quot;these children&quot; couldn&#39;t <br/>\nhandle that (glorious!) freedom.  It wasn&#39;t until I had dug deeper <br/>\nthat I found (through Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, and unschooling.info, and <br/>\nthe shine group) that MANY families with special needs kids were <br/>\nunschooling, and their children were living beautiful FULL lives.  <br/>\nSo we jumped in with both feet and haven&#39;t looked back since.  And, <br/>\nsurprise, surprise...autism has barely entered my vocabulary since <br/>\nwe began our journey.  It just hasn&#39;t been an issue...the girls are <br/>\njust their own amazing selves and we no longer focus on how <br/>\nto &quot;help&quot; them be more &quot;normal&quot; (whatever THAT is)!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the recent TV thread has been interesting to read.  Since we <br/>\nbegan deschooling (almost a year ago), we&#39;ve let go of tv controls.  <br/>\nWe have three TVs now, big plasma screen with DVR in living room, <br/>\nsmaller TV with Gamecube in Tori&#39;s and Ash&#39;s room, and another big <br/>\nTV in our bedroom (with PS2 and DVR).  My husband and I enjoy LOTS <br/>\nof TV, movies, and music that mainstream parents might try to <br/>\nshelter their kids from...and to be honest, I sometimes wonder if <br/>\nwe&#39;re a little *too* open with regards to what the kids listen to or <br/>\nwatch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne recent example:  Shelby and Tori caught the tail end of the <br/>\nmovie &quot;Love Actually&quot; the other night on Showtime or HBO (not sure <br/>\nwhich).  Well, it just so happens that it&#39;s one of my most favorite <br/>\nfilms ever, and it *was* at the end of the film, where all the <br/>\nlittle stories are being tied up, happy endings and all that.  *I* <br/>\nhad fun pointing out Alan Rickman, and telling the girls that he <br/>\nplayed Snape in the Harry Potter films (to which they replied, &quot;No <br/>\nhe DOESN&#39;T...that guy is too OLD!&quot;) and also Emma Thompson, who <br/>\nplayed Prof. Trelawney in the HP films, and that Liam Neeson had <br/>\nplayed Ra&#39;s al Ghul in the latest Batman flick, so on and so on.  <br/>\nShelby commented that Colin Firth was CUTE, then it was off and we <br/>\nwere getting changed for bed.  Shelby asked me to see if it came on <br/>\nagain, and if I could record it on the DVR.  She was pleased when I <br/>\ntold her that I owned the movie on DVD, and that she could watch it <br/>\nanytime she wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo then, next day I&#39;m putting laundry away and I see Shelby in the <br/>\ngirls room watching &quot;Love Actually&quot; on the DVD player.  I watched a <br/>\nbit with her, then went on with the laundry.  Fast forward an hour <br/>\nor so, and Shelby comes up to me and says, &quot;Hey Mom...what was the <br/>\ndeal with the actors who fell in love during the porn film?&quot;. (Side <br/>\nnote:  in the movie there is a sub-plot or side-story about a man <br/>\nand woman who *simulate* sexual positions on adult movies...they are <br/>\nnot the actual actors, but they &quot;act out&quot; the bits so that camera <br/>\npositions and lighting can be set up.  Anyway, the couple is very <br/>\nsweet and innocent, this is just a job to them, and they end up <br/>\ngetting to know each other and falling in love).  Well, you can <br/>\nimagine that for a split second I was completely flustered and <br/>\nkicking myself over NOT remembering that part of the movie.  I just <br/>\nhad to quickly remind myself to be honest with her.  I explained <br/>\nthat to me, it was funny...maybe ironic...that these two people <br/>\nwould fall in love on the set of an adult movie, and that sex had <br/>\nNOTHING to do with their relationship...they were just very <br/>\ninnocently falling in love.  She was just like, &quot;OK&quot;, and that was <br/>\nit...she just wanted to know more about that particular part of the <br/>\nflick.  No harm meant, and she trusted me enough to ask, and I <br/>\ntrusted her enough to answer her honestly, just as I would any <br/>\nadult. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, that&#39;s us.  I&#39;ve enjoyed being here, learning from all of <br/>\nyou, and I&#39;m looking forward to reading/learning even more here.  <br/>\nThanks for having me!<br/>\n<br/>\nPaige</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9312,"nextTopicId":9558}}
