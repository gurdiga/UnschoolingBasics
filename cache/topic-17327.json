Either do what I want (put on sun screen) or go ahead  and <br/>\nburn.  And I didn&#39;t understand the wound thing so I can&#39;t begin to come  up <br/>\nwith more solutions for that.  But turn it into a win-win  situation.  Where <br/>\nyou get what you want and so does the child.  If you  think about it in the sun <br/>\nburn issue, what mom wants is for the child to not get  sun burned (it really <br/>\nhas nothing to do with wanting the child to wear sun  screen and sun screen is <br/>\nonly one solution) and the child wants to swim, play on  the beach.  Try to <br/>\nfigure out a solution where both wants/needs are  met.  You can apply this to <br/>\nany scenario.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have dealt with some tough ones here that I wondered at times if we  would <br/>\never come up with a solution that would be agreeable to everyone.   But we <br/>\nkept working at it until we did.  Remember to think win-win.   Really identify <br/>\nwants and needs and be creative.  Also involve the child in  the process.  I <br/>\ntotally believe that only the individual can know what is  truly best for <br/>\nhimself.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust my thoughts,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17306,"nextTopicId":17271}}
