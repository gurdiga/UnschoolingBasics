The relationship is an integral part of radical unschooling <br/>\nby definition. The exploring and relationship are partners. They <br/>\ncoexist. The sum is greater than the parts :-) &quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t really get how parents could be unschooling and then realize they<br/>\nneed to change the way they are parenting. That seems like so much work! I<br/>\ndid the reverse. It seemed so natural. But I could have gotten off track<br/>\nquite easily. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been working on my relationship with my son from day 1. Sometimes I<br/>\nwonder if he hadn&#39;t been such a demanding baby if I would have been a<br/>\ndifferent parent. The way I am raising my son certainly isn&#39;t the way I was<br/>\nraised! I have empathy and compassion that wasn&#39;t shown to me. As it turned<br/>\nout, he hated to be left alone (in a bassinet, in a swing, in a stroller) so<br/>\nin order to not have to hear him cry, I held him a lot. I had slings, wraps,<br/>\nand carriers for different purposes. My back ached but my baby was happy. We<br/>\nquickly gave up on the bassinet idea and let him sleep with us. All things<br/>\ncentered on what made the baby happy because if he was happy, I was too. I<br/>\nfelt like a good mother.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt gets a little harder though, as kids grow up, to continue treating them<br/>\nthat way. I mean as I started to hang around other mothers and kids it<br/>\nseemed like there was a fine line between letting your child explore a room<br/>\nwhile keeping him safe and controlling what he explores. As the kids learned<br/>\nto talk, they could tell us what they wanted. It seemed like then the mother<br/>\ncould continue to give the child what he wanted or withhold for some reason<br/>\nand that&#39;s when mothers started to say no. For various reasons or seemingly<br/>\nno reason.<br/>\n <br/>\nChild: I want cookie.<br/>\nMom: No cookies, we&#39;re having lunch soon.<br/>\nChild cries. <br/>\nMom: Stop crying. Play with this toy.<br/>\nChild takes toy and throws across room while crying harder or screaming.<br/>\nMom yells at child to not throw toy and stop crying. Maybe even puts in time<br/>\nout.<br/>\n <br/>\nI can&#39;t say I had a lot of friends who were like that, but I did see<br/>\nepisodes like that. Mothers following a script of what they think they are<br/>\nsupposed to be doing. Somewhere we get off track. We stop following our<br/>\nbaby&#39;s cues and start trying to make them follow ours. And we don&#39;t even<br/>\nknow the reasons why we are doing some of the things we do! I can see where<br/>\nparents might start out with the best intentions and then get off track. Do<br/>\nI keep doing what feels right? I don&#39;t want a spoiled child. Or do I start<br/>\ndoing what everyone else is doing?<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I was just trying to explain how I feel like I started off on the<br/>\nright path to having a good relationship with my son, but was almost<br/>\nsidetracked into the folly of mainstream parenting as he got older. Many of<br/>\nmy friends started sending their kids to preschool at ages 2 and 3. I<br/>\nwondered why a SAHM would opt to send her child away, willingly, for someone<br/>\nelse to raise. I was a little more understanding of working moms doing that,<br/>\nI mean they had to work, right? But those who stayed home? I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand it. A few of my friends kept their kids at home and we continued<br/>\nmeeting up and going to the zoo and stuff like that. <br/>\n <br/>\nI could see where this was going though. They were going to put their kids<br/>\nin Kindergarten and we&#39;d part ways. I started to seek out new friends. I<br/>\nwanted more like minded friends who would support my journey because it felt<br/>\nright to be compassionate when my son had a breakdown and to say yes to<br/>\nthings he wanted. <br/>\n <br/>\nLuckily I found a good group of likeminded parents and a friend recommended<br/>\nthis unschooling conference to me. I went when my son was 3, almost 4, and<br/>\nthat changed my life! There were other parents helping their children<br/>\nexplore, saying yes, acting more as partners in learning than dictators. I<br/>\nliked that atmosphere so much! I finally felt like I could stay on this path<br/>\nand had examples of how kids could be if not sent to school. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo for me, unschooling flowed from the parenting relationship I had and<br/>\nwanted to continue! It seems so natural I can&#39;t see a distinction from the 2<br/>\nideas. It&#39;s just a continuation of how I wanted to raise my child. I must<br/>\nsay that it helped tremendously to see other people doing it and have a<br/>\nmodel to follow and connecting with others within that community. It would<br/>\nbe hard to do alone with no similar friends. <br/>\n <br/>\nKim in Oregon<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: What is the central intention of unschooling?","postDate":"1296944362","msgId":46078,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpa2lkYSttc2V0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MDZGMDA5LUE3NUEtNEIzRi1BMENCLUI1OTc4RUFBMDZFOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":46073,"nextInTopic":46082,"prevInTime":46077,"nextInTime":46079,"topicId":46062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I surely won t argue with that! :D JJ ...
