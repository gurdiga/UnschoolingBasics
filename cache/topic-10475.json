Start now saying you <br/>\nplan to homeschool. Period. No big details. General &quot;we&#39;ve got lots <br/>\nof time...we&#39;re exploring...we&#39;re looking into a lot of options...&quot; <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s all *true*. And just keep living your lives and <br/>\nwatching your wonderful DS grow. By the time he&#39;s &quot;school age&quot;, it <br/>\nwill seem pretty normal to just live life (you&#39;ll already have <br/>\ngotten through the &#39;no preschool&#39; questions by then). After a year <br/>\nor so of living life together with a &#39;school aged&#39; kid, who I pretty <br/>\nsure your whole family will love and cherish and think is a great <br/>\nkid, you can start substituting &quot;unschooling&quot; in discussions <br/>\nof &quot;homeschooling&quot;. Don&#39;t hit it really hard. More like, answer <br/>\nquestions but don&#39;t offer a lot of additional information (kind of <br/>\nthe same as dealing with any legal requirements, stick to the law <br/>\nand don&#39;t offer anything more). The proof of the pudding is in the <br/>\neating...in this case, they&#39;ll already see your wonderful DS in <br/>\naction and growing and thriving. Also, be proactive in <br/>\nproviding &quot;what we&#39;re doing&quot; tidbits...we went to the zoo, we built <br/>\na spaceship with Legos here are some pix of DS with his creation, <br/>\nthe local hs group had a beach day and here&#39;s DS and some other kids <br/>\nlooking for seashells...yadda yadda. So, on the one hand, provide <br/>\nlots of &quot;our days&quot; info that shows you&#39;re not hiding in a dark <br/>\ncloset somewhere but on the other hand, don&#39;t be doing a lot of <br/>\neducational philosophy debates. Odds are they don&#39;t *personally* <br/>\nknow what homeschooling looks like inside (just odd stories here and <br/>\nthere) so whatever you define as &#39;homeschooling&#39; is what you&#39;ve got <br/>\nto work with.

Some are living on one <br/>\nincome; some are juggling shifts/part time jobs; some are working <br/>\nfrom home or running their own businesses. All of these can have <br/>\ntheir own stresses - not unique to unschooling but definitely <br/>\nrepresented in the unschooling population.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother stressor possibly is dealing, fulltime, with medical and/or <br/>\nbehavioral issues (where having the child in school would provide a <br/>\nfew hours away). In those situations, sometimes creating a way to <br/>\nget &quot;time off&quot; - respite care, a babysitter, a bubble bath <br/>\n(depending on the situation) - can help out some in those situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[unschoolingbasics] stress in unschooling?
