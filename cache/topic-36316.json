It&#39;ll take place August 27-30, 2009. Yep, we&#39;re adding another day!  <br/>\nWe&#39;ll also have a brand new location with lots of space and amenities (Huge  <br/>\nhealth club with Olympic sized pool and tennis courts, free Internet in  <br/>\nconference attendee rooms, and lots more).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll have more details for you soon, but I wanted to make sure people got  it <br/>\ninto their calendars. The new web site will be up soon, assuming strange  <br/>\nthings don&#39;t happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn Baptista<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Looking for simple solutions to your real-life financial <br/>\nchallenges?
