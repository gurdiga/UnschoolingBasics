Adults cry, get angry, etc<br/>\nbecause we RELATE - I cry when I see children in harm&#39;s way, I cry happy<br/>\ntears when families reunite, I cry when ole yeller dies, I get angry<br/>\nwhen injustice happens. Not because I believe the situation really<br/>\nhappened in that way to those people but because I know that similar<br/>\nsituations DO happen to REAL people. I cry when the cast on MASH sets up<br/>\nan &#39;anniversary&#39; for BJ (a film of his wife going about the things they<br/>\nwould do on that day with a recording of her voice narrating, a kid<br/>\nplaying &#39;their song&#39; on a harmonica, Margaret dancing with him in lieu<br/>\nof his wife,...) because I know, just a teeny bit, what it&#39;s like to<br/>\nmiss your spouse (and a shout out to all the military spouses who are<br/>\nholding down the fort solo).<br/>\n<br/>\nUse media, don&#39;t fear it. You are a bigger, stronger influence than any<br/>\nTV program IF you don&#39;t lose your credibility and remain connected to<br/>\nyour child(ren). My DS is now almost 12 and has had full access to TV<br/>\nsince he could toddle (and actually noticed the TV). By 18 months, he<br/>\ncould put in his VHS tapes correctly (we had a combo TV/VCR that would<br/>\nturn on automatically when a tape was inserted, start playing, auto<br/>\nrewind and eject at the end, push it back in and it restarted). When we<br/>\ncould finally afford it, we got cable. Rather than fear it and limit it,<br/>\nwe gave him as much access as he desired. We were right there with him<br/>\nin it - I know more about Pokemon (and other favorites) than I ever<br/>\nconsidered possible LOL! We&#39;d mention &quot;this program has X in it, I know<br/>\nthat is something you didn&#39;t like before, do you still want to watch it?<br/>\nWe can start and switch if you want whenever&quot; And, because we never<br/>\ncontrolled what he watched, when we make a suggestion &quot;Hey, you might<br/>\nlike this&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to watch that, do you want to watch with me?&quot;<br/>\nHe&#39;s open to considering it - sometimes he says yes, sometimes he says<br/>\nno, sometimes he wanders in and out. He has no need to watch just to get<br/>\nin his allotted screen time (gotta make every minute count even if<br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing interesting, because I won&#39;t get any more until<br/>\ntomorrow) - he&#39;s more likely to put on the weather channel for<br/>\nbackground music or just turn it off entirely and do something else if<br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing he wants to watch. And, because he trusts our judgment<br/>\non it (we&#39;re not going to ban anything or limit him or control what he<br/>\nwatches), when we suggest something &quot;Hey you might like this&quot; he has no<br/>\nreason to suspect &quot;ulterior motives&quot;. He&#39;s got the entire set of MASH<br/>\nDVDs (by his request), for example, because DH and I were watching it<br/>\nand he was interested. Lots of amazing discussion fodder there (war,<br/>\nviolence, prejudice, history, geography, interpersonal relationships,<br/>\ndrug and alcohol use and abuse, sex/sexuality, and so on) - there was no<br/>\nneed to wait until he reaches age 15 (or 18 or 12 or whatever) to touch<br/>\non those things as they arise. The parts he was able to understand, he&#39;d<br/>\ntake in, the rest went over his head. He loved watching James Bond<br/>\nmovies for a while - he started watching them at around age 5 or 6.<br/>\nLoved the villains and gadgets. Took until he was around 10 for him to<br/>\nnotice &quot;he kisses a lot of girls&quot; - that was totally not of interest to<br/>\nhim (I&#39;ll admit I was a bit nervous about all the double entendres and<br/>\nsuch, e.g. the names of the &quot;Bond girls&quot;, but since HE had no knowledge<br/>\nof the double meanings, a name was just a name).

I had no idea she would be so overwhelmed by the loss of the character&#39;s parents. It was heartbreaking for me how she grieved, so much so that she could not continue to watch the movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a lot of talking about movies after that, about how sometimes there are sad parts, and if you can feel sad but keep watching the movie, then the sad parts change to happier times, and things work out better. Many movies were watched with her sitting right on my lap in case she needed to be comforted, and we&#39;d turn off the movie for awhile and maybe cry, maybe talk about the story, then at some point turn it back on and watch the rest. Those movies gave us reasons &quot;in the moment&quot; to talk about issues like loss, especially of parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll never forget that tiny girl curled up on her &quot;nest&quot; where she liked to watch tv, sobbing. She&#39;s 25 now, kind, sensitive, smart, and funny.

Its not necessary to set limits for children to experience that care. Helping children problem solve and find ways to overcome the very natural limits of the world around them shows them just as much care, as well as providing them with a valuable resource in the form of helpful parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I watch netflix and you tube at night when my baby is asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Babies aren&#39;t often much interested in tv or movies, they&#39;re interested in direct personal experience. Some young children adore movies and tv and find enormous value in being able to watch and watch and watch - while others will be passingly interested and not watch so much. In any case, what young children &quot;get&quot; from any particular show or movie is often very very different from what adults perceive. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;This way I am the one who shapes and expose him to the real world. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t about shaping children, its about living with them in partnership. Young children are remarkably good about letting parents know what they do and don&#39;t want to be &quot;exposed to&quot;. Its totally possible to learn to respond to your child&#39;s cues and discover what he or she finds marvelous - or unsettling or dull or otherwise inappropriate for that particular child at that particular time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Tv gives children the idea that whatever they are watching is real they don&#39;t know the difference. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, adults are the ones who do that - kids are pretty good about figuring out the differences for themselves, when adults don&#39;t confuse the matter by treating a moving picture like its real life. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Even adults cry with sad movies...why do we cry if it is not real<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We cry because we choose to explore those emotions. Just last night I climbed into the bathtub with a book I Knew would make me cry - it was an active choice on my part. When kids are empowered where media are concerned, they also have the ability to choose to explore. They can Choose to be scared, or disgusted, or sad, or they can choose to leave the room or say &quot;I don&#39;t want to watch this&quot; with the knowledge that that&#39;s okay. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I won&#39;t let my son watch tv until he can spell it and write the whole Â word<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability to write &quot;television&quot; doesn&#39;t have much to do with the ability to indicate that he does or doesn&#39;t want to watch a particular show. If you&#39;re watching something and your child is present, be aware of your child! That&#39;s a much better strategy than making some kind of rule. Watch your child watching and see what his reaction is. Is he bored? Find something else to watch. Is he upset? Find something else to watch. Is he confused? Watch Him more. Ask if he wants to talk about it, if he&#39;s the talking sort. Or play out some of the themes from the show to help him explore concepts if he&#39;d rather. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmpowering a child where any kind of media is concerned is a very interactive process in the same way empowering a child to learn about everything else is interactive. Children explore and experiment and they hope to have the support of their parents - not to stand in the way of what they want to explore, but to work with them so that they can be the ones to discover their own interests and their own comfort levels. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Where have the parents gone?

Its *effective* to offer your viewer/listener/reader a perspective of someone who is a little out of place, a little mystified and hampered by the complexities of the world of your story. It gives you reasons to explain things, or reasons to keep your audience guessing! The child or foreigner can also make mistakes that adults wouldn&#39;t be expected to make, which advances the plot nicely. In terms of character development, children are also convenient in that the audience is easily willing to accept growth and change - adults are often so ossified in who they are, and that&#39;s not so fun for the audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Where have the parents gone?

It shows what<br/>\nlife would be like or could be like if you had the ability to make your<br/>\nown choices (as a child).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was reading this and thinking about it, I also remembered that my<br/>\npretend play as a child was always about being abandoned or orphaned.
