We met, like you are planning once a week for about 3 hours at a time. All of us 4 had 2 kids each at the time, 4 mom&#39;s, 8 kids. We rotated homes, the kids played, the hosting family did do some prep/activity stuff, like cut out hearts if we were making Valentine&#39;s cards, pull out sand toys, whatever, and the kids could do what they wanted. We did some group singing, the kids all loved this, head and shoulders, dance around the rooms, we did outings together, visited the hospital helecoptor, the zoo, the parks alot, but one thing we did that the kids loved was had a meal together. The hosting family made a hot meal, either doubled up what they would have for dinner, made extra the night before. The kids and mom&#39;s loved this part and now my older 2 still have fond memories of our lunch group. It lasted until the other 3 families moved out of town over the years. I bet we would all still be having lunch group if the families still lived here, with young teens playing video games and listening to their ipods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary (can you tell I still miss this friends?)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8523,"nextTopicId":8629}}
