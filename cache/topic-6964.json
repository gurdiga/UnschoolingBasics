The assumptions behind this sentence could include<br/>\nthat you are in charge of her learning, that you have the important job of<br/>\ntesting her comprehension, that her reading is for the purpose of learning<br/>\nhow to read better or has some other overtly educational purpose. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther schoolish ideas include that it is ok to engage in inauthentic<br/>\nspeech with children (by which I mean that you have a hidden agenda to<br/>\ntest/quiz her) and that your educational agenda should be paramount, rather<br/>\nthan freeing her to take charge of her own learning journey. Lurking even<br/>\nmore deeply might be the ideas that quizzing has some kind of intrinsic<br/>\nvalue (I believe not) and that her academic achievements are important<br/>\nvalidations of your parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be tough to let go of the desire to keep track of a child&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;progress&quot; or to want to categorize their activities into schoolish terms. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are living in a reporting/assessing State, the temptation to keep<br/>\nliving in this mindset is even stronger. In that situation I have two<br/>\nrecommendations. The first is to keep the records and your record-keeping<br/>\nactions as private as possible, rather than burden your children with the<br/>\nState&#39;s expectations. The second is to keep your records in terms of what<br/>\nyour children have *done* if you can, (still using &quot;educationese&quot;) and leave<br/>\nthe educational authorities to make their own assumptions about what the<br/>\nchildren have *learnt*. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about a genuine conversation with her about what she enjoyed about the<br/>\nbook?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She *has* one I just haven&#39;t let her do 345+678= type math <br/>\nproblems w/it yet. She doesn&#39;t know how to do these on her own,she <br/>\ndoes play w/it and use it in her &#39;store&#39; etc &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say I&#39;m kinda floored by the concept of you not &quot;letting&quot; her use<br/>\nher own calculator for its primary purpose of calculating. I think you are<br/>\nstill dividing life into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot; (or perhaps<br/>\n&quot;trivial play&quot; would be more accurate). I&#39;m going to ask you to think about<br/>\nwhy you believe you have the right to tell her what to do with her own tool<br/>\nor to control her learning, and what you hope to achieve by living in that<br/>\nmode.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly wider society and the dominant school based culture in this<br/>\ncountry give parents both the legal right and the cultural sanction (to<br/>\nvarying points) to be authoritarian or controlling with their children.<br/>\nHowever Unschoolers at every moment are making the amazing choice to<br/>\nvoluntarily renounce these entitlements in favor of creating an environment<br/>\nand culture of freedom and autonomy for their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of that wonderful choice includes a much greater respect for privacy,<br/>\nespecially privacy of thought, on the part of the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that it is damaging to the relationship for a child to believe<br/>\nthat her parent is an arbiter or assessor of her learning or her worth. I<br/>\nbelieve it is damaging to the relationship for a child to be placed in a<br/>\nposition of being suspicious about a parent&#39;s motives when they initiate a<br/>\nconversation. I believe that it is damaging to the relationship for the<br/>\nchildren to feel that they need permission to engage in any passion or hobby<br/>\n(beyond the cooperative sharing of resources). I believe it is damaging to<br/>\nthe soul for it to be implied that one&#39;s play is less worthy than<br/>\ntraditional academic pursuits. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers who have let go of the schoolish in their thinking and their<br/>\nwords, are on the path to much deeper, wonderful, honest relationships with<br/>\ntheir children, where the concept of &quot;permission&quot; is utterly replaced with<br/>\nideas like &quot;co-operation&quot;, &quot;facilitating&quot;, &quot;pleasant surprises of unexpected<br/>\nkindness&quot; and most of all &quot;transcendent moments of magical timing&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My son has always played with calculators. His  <br/>\nfavorite thing was a piece of paper, pencil, calculator and some various dice,  <br/>\nand he would spend an hour or 2 just totally absorbed in his own world. We have <br/>\n quite a few cheapy little calculators lying around the house. And at almost <br/>\n6,  he can do math in his head faster than me... adding and subtracting. Even <br/>\nsome  simple multiplying. <br/>\n <br/>\nI never understood why schools basically &quot;forbid&quot; calculators... I was even  <br/>\nshamed for using my fingers. Yet, out in the REAL world, pretty much everyone  <br/>\nuses a calculator.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny<br/>\nMom  to Danny, Kelsey and Evelyn<br/>\nHappily homeschooling in  Greenfield<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br/>\nLearning is a  treasure that will follow its owner everywhere.  ~Chinese  <br/>\nProverb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela","from":"&quot;Angela&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: new member intro...","postDate":"1129119267","msgId":6976,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTEwMWM1Y2YyNiQ3ZTRlMTM0MCQ2OTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGRpZTVqZittanBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6975,"nextInTopic":6979,"prevInTime":6975,"nextInTime":6977,"topicId":6964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1197631123\">&lt;&lt;sometimes get caught up in when *I* learned a <br/>\ncertain thing and comparing her to others and I shouldn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you shouldn&#39;t. :) It is awful to be compared to someone else even if it<br/>\nis the memory you have of yourself as child.  Maybe when you think of doing<br/>\nthese things, you can take deep breaths and find something to do to amuse<br/>\nyourself.

Many unschoolers do not.  (I<br/>\ndo though, and it&#39;s great!)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Yet I worry if I don&#39;t *make* her do <br/>\nformal English lessons will she &#39;get it&#39; and be able to write reports <br/>\netc &quot;properly&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will still be exposed to writing every time she reads something.  I know<br/>\nwith my own children, who have always been unschooled, that they love to<br/>\nwrite and write often and they ask for help when they need it, whether it is<br/>\nfor spelling, punctuation, or clarity.  Over the years I when I have been<br/>\nhelping them with something that they are writing, I&#39;ve mentioned things<br/>\nthat will help them, like when to use punctuation to make things clearer and<br/>\nwhen to use a paragraph, etc.  My younger dd (9) loves to write stories and<br/>\nis very good at it.  My older dd enjoys writing articles for our family<br/>\nnewspaper, email, and lists of many things.  Both understand all they need<br/>\nto know to do what they want for now.  As they have the need, they will<br/>\nlearn more.  (And I&#39;ll be there to help them)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;She wants to use calculator NOW but I won&#39;t let her <br/>\nuntil she learns simple math &#39;by hand&#39; but she&#39;s NO real interest in <br/>\nthat now *sigh* and if I don&#39;t push her will she &#39;get it&#39; eventually?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, I would give her the calculator and let her play with it.<br/>\nThat is how my older dd (probably 9 at the time) learned about square roots.<br/>\nShe just asked what that button was for and we talked about it.  It&#39;s a very<br/>\nbasic concept.  My kids have a good understanding of basic math but they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t done a lot of it on paper. (We play lots of games that involve<br/>\nmoney, numbers, and logic) There is time for that and I don&#39;t worry about it<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s way more important to know when to use a certain function than<br/>\nto know have the basics memorized at a certain age.  There are all kinds of<br/>\nkids in school who can do the basic math but who don&#39;t know what function to<br/>\nuse to solve a real life problem.  There is one girl we know who freezes up<br/>\nevery time anyone asks her a question because she is so nervous about<br/>\ngetting it wrong. It&#39;s very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And how? I have these &quot;worries&quot; too but I KNOW I have made the right <br/>\ndecision for us as a family;) getting Mom to calm down is the major <br/>\nissue :)~<br/>\nTracy&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do that faster by reading these lists and Sandradodd.com and other<br/>\nunschooling resources.  It&#39;ll help you understand it better in your mind and<br/>\nmaybe then when you worry, you can learn to keep it to yourself.  :)  Good<br/>\nluck!<br/>\nAngela <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: new member intro...","postDate":"1129098092","msgId":6975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGRpZTVqZittanBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6970,"nextInTopic":6976,"prevInTime":6974,"nextInTime":6976,"topicId":6964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1311435250\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Yet I worry if I don&#39;t *make* her do <br/>\nformal English lessons will she &#39;get it&#39; and be able to write reports <br/>\netc &quot;properly&quot;? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she speak English?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Reports&quot; are entirely a schoolish phenomenon.

Unschooling by its very nature is entirely eclectic -<br/>\nsparkling, wide ranging, unlimited, individual - as infinitely varied as the<br/>\nwide world. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who are *home*schooling utilizing a variety of curriculum and<br/>\ninformation sources and styles, such as Unit studies combined with other<br/>\nschool-at-home options, are often termed &quot;eclectic&quot;. It is in comparison to<br/>\npeople using a specific single curriculum or Charter type situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
