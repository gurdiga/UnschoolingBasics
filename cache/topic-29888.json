Many folks receiving this are <br/>\nliable to get several copies of this (as I will), <br/>\nbut I wanted to ensure that I was thorough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people reading this probably know Lisa <br/>\nHeyman; she and her family attended Live & Learn <br/>\nlast year and several years, in fact.  She along <br/>\nwith her husband, Larry, has been a speaker at at <br/>\nleast a couple of L&L conferences and has been <br/>\ninvolved in the NE Unschoolers&#39; conference.  She <br/>\nhas been sharing her incredible wisdom on <br/>\nnational forums for years, and if you&#39;re lucky <br/>\nenough to live in her neck of the woods, as I do, <br/>\nyou also know that she is also a proactive <br/>\norganizer who, in creating a rich world for her <br/>\ndaughters, Roxanne and &quot;Fire,&quot; makes the world a <br/>\nricher, more interesting, more fun place for everyone else, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know Lisa, you may know that she has been <br/>\nhaving some health challenges for quite a while, <br/>\nnow, that have been manifesting as <br/>\nheart-related.  However, a definitive diagnosis <br/>\nhad been frustratingly eluding her.  But, last <br/>\nweek, after testing that included a biopsy of the <br/>\nheart itself, she finally got the diagnosis, and <br/>\nit&#39;s a tricky one.  She has been diagnosed with <br/>\namyloidosis (I&#39;m guessing primary amyloidosis, <br/>\nbut that&#39;s just a guess on my part), more <br/>\ninformation about which can be found here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amyloidosis.org/whatisit.asp\">http://www.amyloidosis.org/whatisit.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLisa asked me to let you know about this, and she <br/>\nis asking for the community&#39;s support in the following ways:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know Lisa well enough to call her, *please <br/>\ndon&#39;t*.  Her daughter, Roxanne, asks that folks <br/>\nnot call the house as she doesn&#39;t want to endure <br/>\nthe pain right now of having to answer questions <br/>\nand retell stories.  Roxy says would appreciate <br/>\nadults not asking her about what&#39;s going on; <br/>\nhowever, her friends have shown interest in how <br/>\nRoxy herself is doing, and that feels good to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa has gone no-mail on the lists she belongs <br/>\nto, so if you want to send her an email message, <br/>\nyou can send it to her home email address, if you <br/>\nknow it, or send your message to me, and I&#39;ll <br/>\nforward it to her (putting &quot;forward to Lisa&quot; in <br/>\nthe subject line will be extremely helpful!).<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, she asked me (directly quoting Lisa <br/>\nhere) to &quot;put a request out to the unschooling <br/>\ncommunity (e-lists at large) asking for healing <br/>\ncircle of energy to be sent our way.  I havent <br/>\nbeen terribly active on the lists over the past <br/>\nyear but do continue to read....We have booked <br/>\nour rooms at the NEUnschoolers conference and the <br/>\nLive and Learn Conference and look forward to <br/>\nseeing everyone there  but in the meantime I am <br/>\ncalling upon all to send us a welcome energy of <br/>\nlight, healing and well being to be sent our <br/>\nway.  I have called upon my community of friends <br/>\nand the love we feel from everyone is a great comfort.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will benefit, I believe, from all the <br/>\nconcentrated loving energy that can be focused on <br/>\nher, and I am asking folks to hold her in that kind of light.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nSending love,<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/\">http://www.joyfullyparenting.com/</a>&gt;Joyfully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/\">http://zintz-kunkel.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;Our Unschooling Life (a &#39;blog)<br/>\nLive Fully ~ Live JoyFully!<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29859,"nextTopicId":29808}}
