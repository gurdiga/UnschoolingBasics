And, this being your<br/>\nthird child, you must have gone through something<br/>\nsimilar, no?  My almost two year old went through the<br/>\nsame tv/video watching as yours starting in my late<br/>\npregnancy with my second child.  I believe this is a<br/>\ncommon occurrance, and there is actually an article<br/>\nwritten about it in a past Mothering issue. <br/>\nPersonally, videos can be quite helpful especially<br/>\nwhen there is another child who *needs* your<br/>\nattendance, and also to give mom some time to herself<br/>\n(teeth brushing, eating, bathroom- wow!).  So, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t feel too bad about it.  As your newborn gets<br/>\nolder, you will figure out what works for your family<br/>\nand what you all feel good about.  You can watch the<br/>\nprogram with your child as you nurse your baby!  Often<br/>\nnow, my first born will ask to watch a video first<br/>\nthing in the morning, and I usually try to encourage<br/>\nplaying first thing instead, or at least eating<br/>\nbreakfast before a video.  Playgroups are helpful too-<br/>\nyou can host one at your house and have extra help<br/>\nwatching/entertaining your older girls, or perhaps a<br/>\nfriend can take one/both of your girls to a playgroups<br/>\nthus giving you a little alone time with your newborn.<br/>\n Trips to the library are also fun, and you can get<br/>\nsome new books/ reading done there, AND check out new<br/>\nvideos/DVDs.  It&#39;s also a fairly easy outing- if your<br/>\nchildren are patient enough to stand in line while<br/>\nitems get checked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your newly expanded family!<br/>\n-Jennefer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/\">http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/yahoo/votelifeengine/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2308,"nextTopicId":2324}}
