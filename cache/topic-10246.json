I enrolled them in a small school and taught at their school; this seemed like the next best thing to homeschooling.  <br/>\n  Katrina blew into our lives and changed a lot of things.  We lived in Waveland, MS.  Since we lost our home we went to live with relatives while my DH got his work transfered to the DC area. <br/>\n   The kids and I embraced homeschooling - traveling across the states twice was really fun, (carschooling).  We knew we needed a break.  Time to curl up on the couch and read all day if that was what we wanted to do.  As a nontraditional teacher, I had already been reading unschooling information. After Christmas I decided not to start back with our homeschooling but let the kids (girl 12 and boy 8) slide into unschooling.  They came to me in Mid January upset that I hadn&#39;t been telling them what to do.  Can you believe it?  I was saddened to realize how programed for the positive feedback they had been in school.  <br/>\n  So, we had a big discussion about this.   Both kids were working in the math program at a level above their grade.  They had a big confidence boost when they went into the next grades&#39; classrooms.  This was important to them to keep &quot;ahead in&quot;.  So we do a math program that matches what they would be doing in school (Chicago Everyday Math).  Everything else is as they want to do it.  Kids that have been in school are acutely aware of what the &quot;others&quot; are doing.  So my solutions was for them to set goals for themselves.  If they want to do math or whatever then they set that goal and do it.  In our discussion I told them it was important to me that I was not in a roll of demanding that they do certain tasks.  And they also need to realize that they are doing these things now for themselves and not to be the top in the class.  This was harder for my dd at 12 and used to being at the top. <br/>\n  They also have maintained their sense of humor about all this.  If they write a letter orhelp me grocery shop and figure some math at the check out stand  one of them will say, &quot;So mom you would count this as a school day wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;  My standard reply is that everyday is a school day becasue we learn something.<br/>\n  Heavy eyerolling at this point. <br/>\n  Anyway I think that goals are useful if you set them for yourself.  And for a school kid coming to unschooling having the freedom to set some goals and then get there will feel great.<br/>\n  plantclan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
