My son doesn&#39;t have to tell him what he is doing for every<br/>\nmoment of the day but I do ask that he tell me when he is going outside.

When my youngest who has very curly, wild hair wanted to try kindergarten last year, we got notes sent home because the teacher thought she wasn&#39;t being cared for due to us not washing and combing her hair daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I sit and freak out over it?  No.  Do I take things into consideration?  Yes.

They  <br/>\nwashed them at night and one sent a lil note to the teacher.  I don&#39;t  think <br/>\nits rare at all..<br/>\n <br/>\nThe shoe situation was one I cringed about last week. I bought one of my  <br/>\nlittle guys a pair of sneaks I have been looking at and got a great deal on  <br/>\nthem. Our yard is mud pit. I hoped he wouldn&#39;t put them on to go out and play  <br/>\nbecause of the mud but also because it is so muddy he would be in deeper than  <br/>\nthe shoe. He did after a day or so decide to wear them and they did get covered  <br/>\nbut look just as new after a wash. No harm done.. Glad I didn&#39;t say  <br/>\nanything... a few years ago I may have.. <br/>\nWith four I buy backups. Not 60.00 but I buy right. <br/>\nYesterday I walked into Gap and found sneaker/shoes (quicklace) for  $2.97. <br/>\nCould have purchased 3 pair to replace the Vans I bought also on  clearance. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d say with love and support 10 out of 10 will result in no harm. It&#39;s ok  <br/>\nto help them. Saying no due to what if&#39;s is harder than saying yes..standing by <br/>\n them as support and being there with the hug or high five is way more fun. <br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;You know, I know that 9 times out of 10 letting him make his  own<br/>\nchoice will not result in any harm done. So, how do you draw the  line?<br/>\nJust on safety issues? For example, sometimes he wants to wear  the<br/>\nsame clothes 3 days out of a week to school (yes, he is in PS  right<br/>\nnow, we are moving to HS very soon). I&#39;m afraid people think  I&#39;m<br/>\nneglectful and don&#39;t buy him enough clothes! Is that crazy of me?  Or<br/>\nhe&#39;ll want to wear his brand new shoes outside to play. Should I  just<br/>\nlet him and explain that if they&#39;re ruined, that&#39;s fine, but no  more<br/>\nnew ones for X amount of time?

You can&#39;t get another person to <br/>\n&quot;learn self-motivation&quot;; you can only control yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here&#39;s my suggestion for getting out of his way and letting him be:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you become conscious of the thing that you want to change <br/>\n(you&#39;ve already done that:  You know you have to stop micro-managing <br/>\nhis affairs).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, you catch yourself *after* you&#39;ve done it, and you apologize <br/>\nto him for having done it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, you catch yourself *as* you&#39;re doing it, and you stop yourself <br/>\nin the process and apologize to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, you catch yourself just before you&#39;re going to do it, and you <br/>\ncongratulate yourself for not doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour process of doing this will be helpful to you and to everyone <br/>\naround you, especially your son, who will watch you transform <br/>\nyourself and will vicariously get to see how it&#39;s done.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, watch him make mistakes and grow and make choices and be late <br/>\nfor things and wear the wrong stuff and wear the right stuff and set <br/>\nthe alarm to get up and feel a little crummy from something he&#39;s <br/>\neaten and make a better food choice and watch him blossom and become <br/>\na thinking individual. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10573,"nextTopicId":10730}}
