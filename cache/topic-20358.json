How old is your child and will she/he have a meltdown if denied because she/he expects the answer to be yes as it usually would.  Is the child old enough to understand if you explained maybe later because so and so isn&#39;t allowed candy?  <br/>\n <br/>\nEven if you would at home, the answer can still be no.  Children of all ages need to learn that the rules are different at different places.  Like volume at the library, or running at the grocery store.  So if the issue was candy, I would probably say not now but later.  If it an issue that really would really rub me the wrong way, I would probably allow it.  Say the children are watching an interactive program on tv and the other family is only allowed to sit quietly and watch, even if the program asks the children to respond.  I wouldn&#39;t deny my child the right of expression (which seems appropriate in this case) just because this family does thing differently. <br/>\n <br/>\nMindy<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kristenhendricks55@...\">kristenhendricks55@...</a><br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sat, 6 Jan 2007 9:34 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHypothetically...<br/>\n<br/>\nLets say you are with your kids at your friends house and your child <br/>\nasks you if he can (for example) have some candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friends kids havent had dinner yet and you know she won&#39;t allow <br/>\nthem any candy.
