They are humoring me in regards to homeschooling  <br/>\n(basically supporting my decision but want Tristan &quot;mainstreamed&quot; back into  <br/>\nschool ASAP) but would be totally and utterly against the idea of  unschooling.  I <br/>\ncan see just an incredibly unhappy visit on the  horizon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n <br/>\nMalinda, maybe you should play up the fact that your husband is in  Iraq.  <br/>\nSometimes with families, you just have to buy a little  time.   You can tell <br/>\nthem that the stress of having a husband in  combat is overwhelming and that this <br/>\nis the best solution for now that you have  found.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThen when your husband comes home, you&#39;ll need your son home from  school for <br/>\nthe transition time.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter that, you&#39;ll be feeling much more sure of the unschooling and your  <br/>\nparents might even be able to see it working and they&#39;ll lay off of you.   That&#39;s <br/>\nhow it happened for me.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would give them as little info as you can get away with.  It was so  hard <br/>\nfor me to not tell my mom everything I was doing, but it turned out for the  <br/>\nbest.  She is now supportive of my homeschooling, but she still has never  heard <br/>\nthe word unschooling or asked me what we do all day. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf your parents make this an unhappy visit, I would say &quot;my husband is in  <br/>\nIraq.  I am doing everything I possibly can to make this a wonderful  Christmas <br/>\nfor Tristan.  If you have anything negative to say to me, please  hold your <br/>\ntongue until after the holidays.  All of our energy needs to be  focused on <br/>\ncreating a joyful holiday, Tristan and I want you here. But if you  cannot just be <br/>\npositive then I need you to not be here.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nAlthough it wasn&#39;t about homeschooling, my mother and I had a similar  <br/>\nconversation when my husband was in Iraq.  I had to tell her that my stress  level <br/>\nwas through the roof and I could not listen to her negativity at that  time.  <br/>\nShe got the point and quit bitching at me, actually she was really  quite sorry <br/>\nand didn&#39;t realize she had been doing that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll be thinking of you!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8412,"nextTopicId":8380}}
