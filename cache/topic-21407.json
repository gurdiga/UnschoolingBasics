Sadly after 4 months<br/>\nof us leaving, the cat was run over and died.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time my son was 3 years old, yet still walks around with his soft toy<br/>\ncat (of same colour and name as our previous real cat!) pretty much<br/>\npermanently, and spends a great deal of time making &#39;cat homes&#39;, &#39;cat play<br/>\nspaces&#39;, etc, etc. We have decided not to get another cat, as are thinking<br/>\nof returning to Europe in the near future, and do not want to put any of the<br/>\nfamily, particularly our son, through any similar emotional turmoil (plus<br/>\nthe cat!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I was wondering - does anyone please have any great ideas on how we can<br/>\n&#39;stretch&#39; his cat interest?!!! We have played vets, made cat sticker books<br/>\nand pictures, drawn houses and counted cats inside them, visited pet shops,<br/>\nand even looked after a friend&#39;s cats when they were on holiday. He loved<br/>\nall these activities, but I have to admit - I am running out of ideas!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of any great books (particularly easy chapter books) we can<br/>\nread to him, easy puzzles or board games involving cats, or just about<br/>\nanything?!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to the replies!

Sadly after 4 months<br/>\nof us leaving, the cat was run over and died.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time my son was 3 years old, yet still walks around with his soft toy<br/>\ncat (of same colour and name as our previous real cat!) pretty much<br/>\npermanently, and spends a great deal of time making &#39;cat homes&#39;, &#39;cat play<br/>\nspaces&#39;, etc, etc. We have decided not to get another cat, as are thinking<br/>\nof returning to Europe in the near future, and do not want to put any of the<br/>\nfamily, particularly our son, through any similar emotional turmoil (plus<br/>\nthe cat!).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I was wondering - does anyone please have any great ideas on how we can<br/>\n&#39;stretch&#39; his cat interest?!!! We have played vets, made cat sticker books<br/>\nand pictures, drawn houses and counted cats inside them, visited pet shops,<br/>\nand even looked after a friend&#39;s cats when they were on holiday. He loved<br/>\nall these activities, but I have to admit - I am running out of ideas!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone know of any great books (particularly easy chapter books) we can<br/>\nread to him, easy puzzles or board games involving cats, or just about<br/>\nanything?!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to the replies!
