We have a very slim budget, so we&#39;ve found ways to do that creatively. One solution we have is that we have an old, clunky computer that isn&#39;t hooked up to the internet and all non-internet games, movies and writing happens there. That helps a lot! I can do a lot of writing on the one and then use a flash drive to transfer it to the other computer and not be tying up the internet composing. It also helps us to have a &quot;games&quot; tv - one that&#39;s not hooked up to the dish. That tv is a little older and clunkier, too - a yard sale find. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":434067329,"authorName":"grandchawhe4","from":"&quot;grandchawhe4&quot; &lt;grandchawhe4@...&gt;","profile":"grandchawhe4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Sibling TV fights","postDate":"1269081680","msgId":43416,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhvMjhvZyt1b2wyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43417,"prevInTime":43415,"nextInTime":43417,"topicId":43416,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Awhile ago I posted that I had limited TV for my children.
