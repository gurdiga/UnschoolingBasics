One thing I haven&#39;t seen discussed <br/>\nis your husbands relationship with your boys.  He may use language that you <br/>\nthink is offensive but I wanted to let you know about my life.<br/>\nMy kids are now 20yob, 18yob and 17yog.... I spent too much of their earlier <br/>\nlife cringing at some of the (what I thought at the time) stupid and wrong <br/>\nthings my dh said.... However, I have realized... with the perception of <br/>\ntime... that my dh and my kids have their own relationships, quite different <br/>\nbut non the less -- SPECIAL!!!They can bs now about silly things and use <br/>\ntheir own slang and can talk to their dad about many things and in their own <br/>\nunique way... but I have  a different relationship (I am the more serious I <br/>\nquess - lol), and they can talk to me about more serious things. I used to <br/>\nthink that that made me more important.... but then, I realized, the stupid <br/>\nidiot I was, and realized that although my kids can always talk to me about <br/>\nANYTHING...the (what seems to me) more casual conversations they have with <br/>\ntheir dad are just as important to THEM.  It is a bond, a connection that <br/>\nbelongs to only them, just like my seemingly more serious connection really <br/>\nhappens with me.<br/>\nI say this because when my kids were as little as yours, my dh always would <br/>\nfall asleep watching shows like Baywatch, and I was APPALLED!! I mean, 3 yr <br/>\nolds shouldn&#39;t have been watching Pamela Anderson &quot;bouncing&quot; around and I <br/>\nwas at wits ends.... but my then 3yr old is now 18 and he doesn&#39;t remember <br/>\ntooo much about PA... just the times he spent w/ his dad.<br/>\nSo.... I guess in conclusion, I really only want to reasure you that the <br/>\nthings you think your kids may be picking up from what you think is your <br/>\ndh&#39;s &#39;bad language/behavior&#39;, is really only their own communication with <br/>\nhim.  It is special to them and looking down on it can only hinder your <br/>\nrelationship with your kids.  Please understand that just because it is <br/>\ndifferent, doesn&#39;t make it less special for your kids. Snizzle my jizzle. <br/>\nLOL.<br/>\nAccept that their relationship will be different than your relationship and <br/>\nrevel in the fact that they are blessed to have that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you my best and second and third the sleep option... I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nenough sleep for 5 years and realized a long time ago (too late of course) <br/>\nthat sleep deprivation caused my depression and lack of motivation, <br/>\netc....... do WHATEVER you can to get your sleep.

I <br/>\ncan&#39;t emphasise enough how much easier it is to deal with anything <br/>\nelse if you are not a walking zombie of exhaustion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I want to tell you other big things that have moved me to a <br/>\nbetter place. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter sleep the next big thing for me is these online groups. I am <br/>\nalso a member of others and recommend AlwaysUnschooled and Peaceful <br/>\nPartnerships. I immersed myself for months, just reading and reading <br/>\nand occasionally posting but gradually I realised that bit by bit I <br/>\nam truly changing. The knock on effect in my family has been great. I <br/>\nstill have plenty of days like yours but there is enough change to <br/>\nsee with great clarity that an unschooling life with my children at <br/>\nhome is not going to drown me. There is so much going on in your post <br/>\nthat will be addressed regularly on these lists and bit by bit I have <br/>\nbeen able to shift my thinking and my actions and habits. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the third big thing that pulled me from where you are atm was <br/>\nsimply my sons becoming that little bit older. It is easy to imagine, <br/>\nwhen thay are behaving as you describe, that unless you get a grip on <br/>\nit right now things will be even worse when they&#39;re older. But my <br/>\nexperience is that their growth and development does make things <br/>\neasier. Once you can trust that they will stop at the road, once you <br/>\nare able to leave them alone in another room for a few moments, once <br/>\nthey can deal with their own needs for a drink or opening a box etc <br/>\netc it makes a huge difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW if I saw you out with your kids behaving as you describe I would <br/>\nNOT think of you as a joke.

something (craft, paint, library???).  <br/>\nOr &quot;take a walk?&quot;  I dread it - my almost 4 year old doesn&#39;t listen.  <br/>\nNot to ANYthing I say.  He won&#39;t stay close while we walk, rides his <br/>\nbike at a pace I can&#39;t keep up with, doesn&#39;t listen when I yell stop <br/>\nor a car is coming, and runs into the house to pout if I &quot;get <br/>\nserious&quot; about trying to have him honor my &quot;rules&quot; for being in the <br/>\nstreets in our neighborhood.  And my 18-month old won&#39;t just &quot;sit&quot; in <br/>\na stroller, little &quot;chubby car&quot; or the homemade &quot;carrier&quot; I worked so <br/>\nhard on.  If I put him down to walk, he pulls his hand from mine or <br/>\nfalls to his knees<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  in protest, but if I let him just go, he tries to run in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>opposite direction from me - while my big boy is riding like the wind <br/>\nthe other direction.  It&#39;s exhausting chaos and isn&#39;t even REMOTELY <br/>\nfun.  I feel like all I&#39;m doing is complaining, but this is very <br/>\nseriously the state of things.  My kids are like wild horses when you <br/>\nopen the gates.  I see other kids staying close to their parents in <br/>\nthe mall or at the park, and am reduced almost to tears thinking I <br/>\nhave somehow failed to &quot;do&quot; something or impart some information to <br/>\nthem to impress upon either of them how important it is to be near me <br/>\nat important times.  It is absolutely exhausting.  I HATE to do it.  <br/>\nI mostly hate to go almost ANYwhere with them because it is like a <br/>\nridiculous circus act, me running in two separate directions <br/>\nthroughout the mall, or the library, park, grocery store, church, <br/>\nWHEREVER.  It&#39;s awful.  And sadly, I mostly stay inside with them <br/>\nbecause of it.  Even<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;

 <br/>\n&gt; But mostly, my feeling of being overwhelmed is compounded by the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>house.  It&#39;s not so much that there is more to clean, because I am <br/>\nalso somewhat inadequate in that area as well, cleaning on a sort of <br/>\nneeded basis only.  There&#39;s no schedule like, &quot;clean the sinks on one <br/>\nday&quot; or vaccum on another day or wash the kitchen floor on another <br/>\nday.  I absolutely feel like I am treading water with weights on my <br/>\nankles.  But the REAL irritation to me is that almost every room in <br/>\nthis house is still an absolutely DISGUSTING color left from the <br/>\nprevious owners.  One room has two walls that are neon orange, and <br/>\nthe other two are bright orange.  They used to have wallpaper decals <br/>\nbut I took them down over time.  But there is no way on earth that I <br/>\ncan paint &quot;little by little&quot; or do the sanding and patching that has <br/>\nto be done.  Our master bedroom is a disgusting cranberry with a <br/>\nwhite-trash special border along the top of the room that doesn&#39;t <br/>\neven match the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  paint.  It is intolerable.  When we moved in, the basement was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cocoa cola red, with another trashy border along the top of the <br/>\nentire room.  HOWEVER, (this will be one illustration of my husband&#39;s <br/>\natttitude about things), we paid a painter to remove the border and <br/>\npaint the entire room a sort of &quot;new house beige.&quot;  And my husband <br/>\nbought himself an oversized l-shaped sofa with 4 recliners built in, <br/>\nand a 47&quot; TV with a new theater and sound system.  I hate TV in <br/>\ngeneral, can&#39;t tolerate the constant &quot;noise.&quot;  I HAVE NOWHERE TO &quot;GO&quot; <br/>\nTO FIND MY PEACE AND SOLACE.  The living room is yellow and maroon (I <br/>\nkid you not) with our blue-based furniture and decor in it.  Our <br/>\ncranberry bedroom has all of my spa blue and orange bedroom <br/>\naccessories.  I was allowed to have the painters paint the kitchen - <br/>\nwas supposed to go from seafoam green with a maroon border to plain <br/>\nwhite, BUT THE GREEN BLED THROUGH and when I brought it to the <br/>\npainter&#39;s attention he got<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;

or &quot;all that well&quot; so can&#39;t I just deal with <br/>\nit.  And our &quot;office room&quot; is a fleshy colored pink that is <br/>\ndisgusting in daylight, and we are using two folding tables to <br/>\nsupplement our broken desk that we were supposed to replace with a <br/>\nblack desk system that I found (to match our black piano).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;

or understand that <br/>\nright now I&#39;m a mother FIRST, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that <br/>\nI am wrong or unbalanced because I don&#39;t take my kids to the local <br/>\ndaycare three days a week while I go to Target or enjoy &quot;me&quot; time.  I <br/>\nwent to a get together from a meetup.com mom&#39;s group that I&#39;m in, in <br/>\nmy town, and upon seeing all the moms ordering drinks with hard liquor<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  in them, I asked whether anybody was still nursing anybody.  And <br/>\n </span></blockquote>one of them said &quot;oh yea, I&#39;m secretly nrsing my 3 year old.&quot;  And I <br/>\nbelted out &quot;So am I&quot; except that she was joking.  That was her idea <br/>\nof a joke.  Apart from that, I think the group liked me well enough, <br/>\nbut you see where things were headed.  I&#39;m in that online mom&#39;s <br/>\ngroup, I have attended LLL meetings (though they&#39;re about 30 minutes <br/>\naway into the next state - Kansas - and there were no chilren <br/>\nsimilarly aged to my big boy), and am pretty sure there is a <br/>\nhomeschool group here in Joplin (though it is the religious-based <br/>\nfaction).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; What gives me joy / what do we do to get out of the house?  Nothing <br/>\n </span></blockquote>much.  I recently started taking violin lessons again after about 20 <br/>\nyears (I took them for 10 years when I was much younger), so that&#39;s a <br/>\nreal treat to get out of the house not just for the 30 minute lesson, <br/>\nbut for the fun of driving there and home without children in the <br/>\ncar - which means I can put all the windows down, listen to whatever <br/>\nmusic I want to listen to at whatever volume I want to...  It has <br/>\nbeen somewhat difficult to make the time to practice, though once I <br/>\ndid it while nursing my 18month old (which wasn&#39;t pretty) just so <br/>\nthat I could continue playing instead of stopping to hold him.  It&#39;s <br/>\na loud activity that I haven&#39;t been able to do while either child is <br/>\nsleeping/napping.  My husband initiated a weight loss contest at his <br/>\noffice and I&#39;m &quot;unofficially&quot; participating, so I&#39;ve been working <br/>\nhard to &quot;do the treatmill&quot; almost everyday (we have one in our <br/>\nbasement). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  That&#39;s not really a treat and is hard to do with the two kids <br/>\n </span></blockquote>repeatedly trying to get on it while I&#39;m on it, but in the larger <br/>\nscheme of things I do feel better after using it.  I&#39;d like to learn <br/>\nto knit.  Maybe get into a group that meets occasionally.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Being appreciated or appreciating my husband?  Yeah.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>really appreciate him, no.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am the <br/>\nonly parent in the house.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a <br/>\nhousekeeper.  Or a nanny.  No, I really don&#39;t appreciate much of what <br/>\nhe &quot;does for me.&quot;  There are two issues here, for me.  HIs parenting <br/>\nand his spouse-ing.  I feel like his parenting is so absolutely and <br/>\ncompletely divergent from mine, that I am so shocked, disappointed, <br/>\nirritated, and generally dismayed, that I find it difficult to <br/>\njust &quot;turn that all off&quot; (or maybe I should say &quot;turn on&quot; ) and let <br/>\nit all pass while we connect as spouses.  Which we don&#39;t do.  He is a <br/>\nhard-worker, with decent morals, motivated by the desire for <br/>\napproval.  He is an executive level administrator, working for the <br/>\nState of Missouri.  I, on the other hand, do not have a job - as he <br/>\nreminds me often while trying to make a joke of it to make himself <br/>\nseem like &quot;a big<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  man.&quot;  His ideas about parenting, SCHOOLING, and directing our <br/>\n </span></blockquote>small children are... well, almost opposite of mine.  He makes fun of <br/>\nme wanting to teach our children at home - saying that I can &quot;barely <br/>\nmanage them all day long&quot; and hand them off to him when he walks in <br/>\nthe door, and then I want to keep them home from school?  He does not <br/>\nfollow &quot;my&quot; procedures for running the home.  And my big boy has <br/>\nalready keyed into the idea that there are two sets of rules / ways <br/>\nof doing things:  The way mom does things while dad is at work, and <br/>\nthe way he (the child) can do things when dad is home.  And I&#39;m <br/>\ntalking about EVERYTHING.  If I say that he needs to put his socks <br/>\nand shoes on to ride his bike(stating a rule of safety), he will then <br/>\nask his dad whether he needs to put his socks on and my husband will <br/>\nsay that he DOES &quot;because it&#39;s cold out&quot; (implying that if it was <br/>\nwarm, you wouldn&#39;t have to wear them) - to which my son will <br/>\nsay, &quot;it&#39;s NOT cold<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  outside.&quot;  So, the whole issue morphs into an argument about the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>weather, rather than a safety rule.  I have tried to say that if he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to wear socks when it&#39;s cold out, then he will simply be <br/>\ncold (and I typically have extra warm/er clothes in the van.  But my <br/>\nhusband offers &quot;bogus&quot; reasons for doing things, especially after I <br/>\nsay something.  And lately he has started telling our son to &quot;ask <br/>\nMomma.&quot;  So, the responsibility falls back on me.  Like the other day <br/>\nI actually had a few minutes where I was able to take a bath (without <br/>\nhaving to bathe the children while I did it) and my husband actually <br/>\nsent my big boy into the bathroom to ask me whether he could play <br/>\nwith a golf ball inside the house!  Well, I answered while reminding <br/>\nof the house rule (no heavy, hard balls inside the house - it&#39;s too <br/>\nmuch to monitor with an 18month old) and sent him out of the <br/>\nbathroom.  Minutes later, my husband came in and asked whether I told <br/>\nXie that<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  he could play with the golf ball in the house, because he lied and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>said that mom said it was okay.  Well, duh, why would he have to ask <br/>\nme that?  Does he not know/live by the same house rules that the rest <br/>\nof us do?  My son knows the rule, but lately has taken to testing my <br/>\nhusband&#39;s knowledge of all of them.  And I don&#39;t care whether <br/>\nsomebody wants to tell me that my husband is sooooo busy at work all <br/>\nday long that when he comes home he wants to &quot;disengage&quot; or <br/>\ndecompress or whateve rthe excuse is.  He&#39;s not that stupid.  He&#39;s <br/>\njust lazy.  And he&#39;s a lazy parent because he CAN be.  meaning, <br/>\nbecause I ALWAYS take up the slack.  There is no other choice, for me <br/>\nat least.  So, every evening our house is chaotic, loud, and <br/>\ndisorganized, while my kids push the limits of everything and my <br/>\nhusband tries to squeeze in his sports games and whatever TV show he <br/>\nrecorded.  DId I mention that I hate the tv?  And the way it divides <br/>\nour family.  My husband<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  sits staring at the tv with his back against the couch, as if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sitting on the floor is a magical way to be at the kids&#39; level, but I <br/>\ncan hear each of them (the kids) yelling for him to look at them - he <br/>\nstares right over them at the TV.  Lately it&#39;s football - which seems <br/>\nto be on every day anymore not just monday nights.  And my son/s can <br/>\nbe standing on the couch, jumping and walking all over it, while my <br/>\nhusband sits there with his back against it, and I can be in the <br/>\nother room and I&#39;m to believe that I&#39;m the only one who can HEAR them <br/>\ngetting crazy while he&#39;s sitting RIGHT THERE?  I won&#39;t believe that.  <br/>\nI&#39;m responsible for the lives of two other souls all day long and I <br/>\nmanage to multi-task or do things in a way that I can still manage <br/>\ntheir safety.  And he cannot?  It&#39;s downright disgusting to me.  So, <br/>\nI end up being the one who comes into the room, states the rule (sit <br/>\ndown on the couch, or GET down) and the kids see me as the &quot;bad guy.&quot; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Plus, if I&#39;m in the tub, I can usually hear the savagery, which <br/>\n </span></blockquote>continues until someone gets hurt. ALWAYS.  And then the child who <br/>\ngets hurt ALWAYS walks into the bathroom crying, at which point, my <br/>\nprivate bath time is over.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Oh, and it really undermines my daily guidance of our boys when my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>husband uses ghetto slang with them. LIke telling them something <br/>\nis &quot;off the schnizzle&quot; (which my almost 4 year old repeats) or <br/>\nteaching him to do some vulgar movements after hitting a homerun <br/>\n(which he seems to expect him to do after my husband has a big hit at <br/>\na softball game).  Or teaching him to sing &quot;Whoop that trick.&quot;  I <br/>\nmean, what are we, in junior high?  During the day, I teach them <br/>\nsongs like &quot;Doe a Deer&quot; (From The Sound of Music) or to sing the <br/>\nalphabet - in other words, AGE APPROPRIATE things.  He is dumbing <br/>\nthem down with stuff that I would be mortified if either of them ever <br/>\nactually parroted my husband in public.  It&#39;s not even &quot;stuff&quot; it&#39;s <br/>\njust stupid crap that I don&#39;t think they need to be exposed to at <br/>\nthis tender age, like stupid little quips from the Jim Rome show <br/>\n(sports &quot;talkshow&quot; if you want to call it that) that my almost 4 year <br/>\nold repeats with enthusiasm<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  after my husband &quot;uses&quot; the lines on him.  They have the rest of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>their lives to hear all of that and to decide whether they want to <br/>\nemulate it.  I don&#39;t know whether the main unschooling tenets include <br/>\nexposing your kids to things that are totally age inappropriate, <br/>\nsocially inappropriate, and politically incorrect in the larger <br/>\nscheme of life, but I&#39;m not a fan of that sort of thing.  I can&#39;t <br/>\nimagine that&#39;s part of &quot;an education&quot; until the child has the skills <br/>\nand life experience to differentiate between desirable and <br/>\nundesirable language, behavior, and custom.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a victim, that&#39;s not my point of any of this.  Rather, I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>CHOOSE to actively parent, to be very aware of my kids and to try to <br/>\nmaintain some semblance of order in our house, whether it&#39;s <br/>\nenforcement of safety rules (like no swinging a sword at your little <br/>\nbrother&#39;s head or stopping the swordfight until I can help them have <br/>\none safetly, whereas he would just let them go at it until somebody - <br/>\nalways the baby - gets hurt), or just plain procedures to maximize <br/>\ngood hygiene (like accompanying Xie to the toilet where I&#39;ve seen <br/>\nthat he needs further assistance and guidance in learning to pee <br/>\nstanding up, because he&#39;s getting it all over himself, the floor, and <br/>\nhis clothes - whereas my husband just yells to him from the other <br/>\nroom whether he&#39;s &quot;okay&quot;), or somewhat regularly scheduled eating <br/>\nintervals (somehow on weekends he doesn&#39;t present food at least three <br/>\ntimes a day because he says he isn&#39;t hungry - hello, they&#39;re children <br/>\nwho typically eat three<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  times a day during the week, and when he doesn&#39;t offer them <br/>\n </span></blockquote>something to eat, the baby comes to me to nurse).  And really, <br/>\ndespite the level of detail here, I&#39;m not so difficult to get along <br/>\nwith that I can&#39;t make friends.  I used to have a nice network of <br/>\nfriends when we lived in Tucson, and I made friends quickly with a <br/>\nfamily that lived across the street from the house we had in Illinois <br/>\nbriefly, and I&#39;ve maintained some of those friendships while we&#39;ve <br/>\nmoved back and forth across the country like gypsies.  I&#39;m just <br/>\nfeeling like there is no substitute for having a girlfriend over, <br/>\neven with her kids, during the day and being able to get a few things <br/>\ndone while she&#39;s here because she can help with my chilren or help ME.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I do value your offer of virtual friendship.  And I was in tears <br/>\n </span></blockquote>reading your posts, touched by your warmth.  And I WILL do some of <br/>\nthe reading you suggested.  And I won&#39;t forget to savor the &quot;good <br/>\nmoments&quot; with my babies.  I WILL make adjustments.  I&#39;m not a lost <br/>\ncause.  There are just times when I feel like the weight of the world <br/>\nis on MY shoulders, alone, and would love to have a mother, <br/>\ngrandmother, husband, close friend who could come over, to <br/>\njust &quot;fight the good fight&quot; WITH me.  Instead of feeling like a mule <br/>\nchained to a heavy load, wishing I was a big powerful clydesdale <br/>\n(spelling?) pulling on a team that would get us to where we&#39;re going <br/>\nso much faster that we&#39;d probably have time to run wild in the field <br/>\nand eat the tall grass.  And my main concern is that all of my <br/>\nstruggles, mental, emotional, whatever, are being &quot;passed onto&quot; my <br/>\nboys.  The bottom line is that I want to change, better myself, make <br/>\na better environment for them,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  and to lay a better framework for helping them learn the things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they need to know in order to get to where they want in their lives.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m actually a lawyer.  I came from a family of divorce and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>remarriage of both parents.  My father was especially controlling, <br/>\nand continues to try to be.  His family is Italian, Catholic, and not <br/>\nformally educated (except for me and a few other same generation <br/>\ncousins) and maintained a strict hierarchy of governance that was <br/>\nheaded by his mother, until her death two Augusts ago.  There were <br/>\nplenty of family rules, plenty of SHOULDS, and CAN&#39;Ts.  I became a <br/>\nlawyer to &quot;show them&quot; that I COULD.  My mother (who died in 1991) was <br/>\nArmenian, from a differently controlling family that stressed <br/>\nconformity to overarching &quot;American&quot; ways - including a husband who <br/>\nworked, a stay at home mother with beauty school training who <br/>\ncould &quot;do hair&quot; in the basement for money on the side, and who took <br/>\npride in cooking, cleaning, and getting the children to and from <br/>\nschool.  My mother divorced my father, never went to beauty school, <br/>\nremarried a man with a couple<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  kids, had my brother, and initiated our move in the 1980&#39;s from <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Illinois to Arizona, after which &quot;The FAmily&quot; stopped talking to <br/>\nher.  She was a &quot;maverick.&quot;  And so, I like to think that I got the <br/>\nbest of both worlds from my parents.  Though I have spent <br/>\nconsiderable time (and money) in &quot;counseling&quot; trying to forge my OWN <br/>\npath.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt; And SO, here I am, trying to unschool mySELF (unsure of this <br/>\n </span></blockquote>context) and wanting more, or should I say LESS, for my own <br/>\nchildren... wanting them to find their own right path without forcing <br/>\nthem down MY &quot;right path.&quot;  I&#39;m discovering that I&#39;m not entirely <br/>\nsure what is my right path.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;

Sometimes we barely talk. The kids and I want his attention. We&#39;ve&gt; told him this hundreds of times. He likes the house to be very clean when he&gt; gets home. So the kids and I rush around trying to pick up everything, wash&gt; dishes, etc.  &lt;snip&gt; I think the way Dh is with us&gt; really effects us. He&#39;s also not very supportive of unschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a really, really important piece of the unschooling puzzle. Even if your husband is not 100 percent supportive of unschooling, he needs to be supportive of you and your children, and house cleanliness, dinner-on-the-table, etc., should be a lower priority for him, even if he is a Type A neat freak.  Most important, your DH needs to spend time with you and your children -- as much time as possible, until your cups are full of daddy/husband time and the resentment building up in your heart (and the kids&#39; hearts) dissolves.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe type of behavior you mention here could indicate that your husband is depressed. It&#39;s common among men, yet often is not diagnosed because it isn&#39;t seen as depression - there is no crying, etc., or what we women often think of as depression. Sometimes all it takes is for a man to realize he is depressed to then decide &quot;Oh, gee, I don&#39;t want to be depressed anymore. How do I fix this?&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nAs unschooling moms, we work hard to give our children LOTS of focused, undistracted time; we observe them, get to know them, and, perhaps most importantly, just CONNECT with them simply by spending hours and hours with them. When my children get enough time and attention from me, things naturally go smoothly. It&#39;s the same with a marriage: When DH and I get wrapped up in things outside of each other (work, kids, projects, etc.), our marriage suffers simply from the lack of time and focus on one another. If we shut out everything in the outside world and just hang out, goof off, make cookies together, drink a morning coffee together, we make a connection and I can relax just knowing he is there. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe went down a similar road a while ago, and luckily, my husband had a somewhat of an awakening, and is again the wonderful man I married eight years ago. (I also grew in many ways thanks to our whole experience, and continue to do so - it certainly is not a one-way street.) He would love having a spotless house and dinner on the table every night; I would love to present him with that! However I don&#39;t know how to do that and still be the mom my kids need. Maybe it&#39;s possible? Maybe it&#39;s a totally unrealistic expectation. Honesly, I don&#39;t know and probably never will! :)  But I do what is most important and I do what I *can* do, and at the end of the day, I know that *I* have given it my all. My DH thank goodness has come to appreciate that. I, in turn, don&#39;t demand perfection of him, and am appreciative of what he can do, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nReally, I have found the relationship with my husband to be a fully integral part of how I succeed (and how I feel!) as an unschooling mother. You can sweep issues under the rug for a while, but they are always there, and will be expressed through your children whether you try to cover them up or not.<br/>\n <br/>\n- Ariana<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nSee how Windows® connects the people, information, and fun that are part of your life<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/119463819/direct/01/\">http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/119463819/direct/01/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1226028208","msgId":36978,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdmMGNiZytibjFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4NjU5Q0IyLUI3QzQtNDA0NC1CN0U1LUI5QjAxM0UxNjRBNkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36976,"nextInTopic":36981,"prevInTime":36977,"nextInTime":36979,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... good ...

We keep a<br/>\nwide variety of balls for indoor play. I &quot;know&quot; you aren&#39;t suppose to play<br/>\nball inside but it works for us. Really I don&#39;t have much that is breakable<br/>\nbut the couple things I do I put up out of the way. We even do it in the<br/>\n&quot;big TV room&quot; and nothing has happened to the TV either. My kids climb,<br/>\nbounce, somersaults on our couches...we got couches that aren&#39;t super nice<br/>\n(used leather ones, easy to wipe clean). Right now my ds (almost 6) is<br/>\nrunning and doing tumbles and jumps on my bed, which is on the floor. DS<br/>\n*NEEDS* lots of activity. He has a bunk bed that is perfect for climb up and<br/>\njumping off (we put the bottom mattress on the floor and/or stuffies). We<br/>\nhave a rope ladder inside. we haven&#39;t hung that up yet but are hoping to do<br/>\nit this weekend. We don&#39;t have this now but we use to have a succesion of<br/>\nmini-trampolines, we have a big one out back now that we have a yard. My<br/>\nkids also slide in trash bags or plastic totes down the carpeted stairs. We<br/>\nrecently bought a small tent for a buck and filled that with stuffies and it<br/>\nis great to roll around in or jump into. DS is very tactile and needs to<br/>\nbump into things and hit against things and roll around in things...etc. We<br/>\nalso bring skateboards and scooters in the house. The bottom floor has a<br/>\ncircuit that the kids run around. The baby walks/runs that many. many times<br/>\na day, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have cleared out the kitchen cabinets so that ds and dd(13 months) can<br/>\nclimb in and through it. When it is hot we keep the tub filled for water<br/>\nplay. And in the winter after we turn on the heat too.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make tunnels and such by getting a ball of yarn and letting one or<br/>\nboth of the kids &quot;sew up&quot; the house. My ds loves to do that he weaves a web<br/>\nand crawls around. It is serious work. It is intricate. When they are done<br/>\ncut the yarn and throw away. If you are concerned about money get it off<br/>\nfreecycle or craigslist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of a jungle gym in the house. I think that might be a great<br/>\nwinter project for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, as the mama of three very spirited kids I understand keeping up.

So investing in <br/>\nways for them to play Large in the house can keep you sane. Clean <br/>\nwith a broom and snow-shovel if you have to! We did when we had the <br/>\nskateboard in the house - just shoved everything to one side and <br/>\npicked through it all when we had time. Happily, the Big toys tend to <br/>\nresult in less mess. All the fun is in interacting with the toy in a <br/>\nbig, physical way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Being appreciated or appreciating my husband?  Yeah.  I don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>really appreciate him, no.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am the <br/>\nonly parent in the house.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a <br/>\nhousekeeper.  Or a nanny.  No, I really don&#39;t appreciate much of what <br/>\nhe &quot;does for me.&quot;  There are two issues here, for me.  HIs parenting <br/>\nand his spouse-ing.<br/>\n****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds like a really stressful situation. I used to have *tons* <br/>\nof resentment towards my stepson&#39;s mother - it seemed like she <br/>\nwas &quot;using me&quot; as her nanny, housekeeper, etc. It took a concious <br/>\neffort on my part to remind myself, over and over, that I was <br/>\nchoosing to do what I was doing For Ray, and that I was glad to be <br/>\nable to care for him. That was important for my relationship with <br/>\nRay - if I was putting a lot of energy into resenting his mom, it <br/>\nmade it much much harder for me to deal with him when he looked or <br/>\nacted like his mom. In the longer run, it has also helped me <br/>\nappreciate the things his mom does do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And my big boy has already keyed into the idea that there are two <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sets of rules / ways of doing things:  The way mom does things while <br/>\ndad is at work, and the way he (the child) can do things when dad is <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n************************<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes. Have you and your dh ever talked about your principles/values? <br/>\nor about what kinds of people you want your kids to grow into? I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean doctors and lawyers I mean kind, thoughtful... those sorts <br/>\nof things? It helps to have some common ground. Then you can go on to <br/>\ntalking about how to get there - how does someone learn xyz? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t the sort of thing you can talk about when things are <br/>\ntense, though. It needs a calm, peaceful time. If you don&#39;t have <br/>\nthose times right now, you can start from a different place, and tell <br/>\nhappy stories about your day Every Day. You might need to practice <br/>\nfor awhile - tell yourself a happy story about the day every day for <br/>\na month so you get in the habit of really noticing the good stuff. <br/>\nThen, when dh comes home and you&#39;re tired and the kids are bouncing <br/>\noff the walls and the house looks like the aftermath of a circus you <br/>\ncan tell some sweet or fun story and help him have some context. <br/>\nMaybe email him a story a day at work, or some cute kid-pix or <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelling positive stories helps him connect with you and the kids. <br/>\nRight now, it may be hard for him to imagine your life - what can you <br/>\npossibly be doing all day? So tell/show him! The Important thing - <br/>\nand its Really Really important, too - is to tell/show the Good <br/>\nStuff, so that you wanting to be home and unschool doesn&#39;t seem so <br/>\ncrazy from his perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to how to pitch redesigning the house into an indoor <br/>\nplayground... here&#39;s a link to a page on &quot;Multiple Intelligences&quot; <br/>\nthat may give you a place to start. Your guys are Kinesthetic <br/>\nlearners! School&#39;s the worst place for them - they&#39;ll be penalized <br/>\nfor wanting to learn with their whole bodies. You can tell your dh <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve done some research on learning styles and this is good <br/>\nfor the kids. Maybe he&#39;ll go for it - it has the advantage of being <br/>\ntrue, anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/mi/dickinson_mi.html\">http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/mi/dickinson_mi.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1225987749","msgId":36970,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdldjRyNStkbDl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MTMwMi44NDQ2Mi5xbUB3ZWIzNzQwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36969,"nextInTopic":36974,"prevInTime":36969,"nextInTime":36971,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay Deborah, This is your chance.

They want <br/>\nto run and play and do not want to go to the mall unless it is to buy <br/>\nthem a toy. They do not want to sit still or follow quiet directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a big park and play ball with them. If you need to sit and <br/>\nrelax find the biggest indoor play area, AKA Mcdonalds, and let them <br/>\nrun. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake them to a pool and swim them for a few hours. Make bubbles, play <br/>\nplaydough. Fill up some dirt with some water and spend and afternoon <br/>\nplaying in the mud.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live somewhere there is a long winter. We often have tropical <br/>\ndays. We turn up the woodstove, wear summer clothes, turn on the <br/>\ntunes and have dance contests. <br/>\n<br/>\nEighteen month olds run into the street sometimes. Especially if the <br/>\ngame works good for mama to come chase. Really focus on chasing and <br/>\nplaying that has nothing to do with what he should not be doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nFour year olds are absolutely the most question asking , authority <br/>\nquestioning not yet adults. It is GREAT! It gives you a chance to <br/>\nquestion what you believe. So before you answer him.. Ask yourself <br/>\nwhat can I do to help him get what he wants for both of us to have <br/>\njoy?! If I say yes what is the worst thing that will happen? What is <br/>\nthe best thing that could happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids want our passion. They want us to notice and be intense with <br/>\nthem. If they cannot find our joy then what?<br/>\n<br/>\nFind some other unschoolers!!!!! Do not hang with the people who are <br/>\nmicromanaging their kids! Hang with the folks who have what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your house, forgive me, but quit being a victim. Buy a can <br/>\nof paint and do it! If you put plastic and duct tape the edges the <br/>\nkids can help. THEY REALLY CAN! Or get up an hour before they do and <br/>\npaint then. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping up with day to day stuff can feel monotonous. Buy a shopvac. <br/>\nIt can suck up socks, papers, food. Then you can trudge through the <br/>\nhouse and say do we want this.... NOPE suck it up! Gone clean. You <br/>\nare not a maid, or a nanny.. GET THAT GONE&gt; You hold the most <br/>\nimportant position that can be held. You are given this honor. <br/>\nRemember not to take stereotypes home with you. YOU MATTER&lt; WHAT YOU <br/>\nDO IN A DAY MATTERS&gt; I truly believe that there is nothing that <br/>\nmatters more. NOTHING&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFind a schedule for yourself as far as house stuff. 25 minutes in the <br/>\nmorning, or evening or after lunch with Sponge Bob on. Put on some <br/>\nrelaxing music and think of it as your workout. That 25 minutes you <br/>\ndecide what things you want done and make it so. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you and dh are in a power struggle. That you are not <br/>\nhappy in your own self right this minute so finding hapiness to share <br/>\nwith him or the kids becomes a struggle. Say to yourself what do I <br/>\nlike about this man. When he walks in thank him for that thing.  When <br/>\nI focus on the things I like about my hubby we are in a much nicer <br/>\nspace.You and he are not in a contest of who is right. You need to <br/>\nfind ways to like who each of you are.

My name is Michelle and we have seven children ranging in age from 15 months to 18 years old. Two of them will be 3 in December, so we have 3 littles under the age of 3 :) Life can get pretty hectic around here, but that is a good thing! I have made a few suggestions based on how we do things in our home and also based on what we are learning as we attempt to adjust to this new lifestyle of RUing :) If I am way off base here, please let me know. I am also a wife who truly appreciates her husband and the fact that he works so hard so I can stay home and raise our children. My husband is not demanding but our relationship has always been one of mutual respect toward each other (kind of RU amongst the two of us :). Now we are learning to treat our children with that same respect. Mike and I don&#39;t always do things the same, or look at things the same way. If something is bothering him but not me, then he will take care of it! Maybe some of the things you are worried about really don&#39;t bother him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;... in protest, but if I let him just go, he tries to run in the opposite direction from me - while my big boy is riding like the wind the other direction.  It&#39;s exhausting chaos and isn&#39;t even REMOTELY fun.  I feel like all I&#39;m doing is complaining, but this is very seriously the state of things.  My kids are like wild horses when you open the gates. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Take them to a park or some place they can actually run and be wild, someplace without restrictions. Someplace where they are free to choose their direction. This will help you also and you won&#39;t feel like you need to constantly be yelling at them. With 3 under the age of 3, I know it can be difficult without help. There are times I am running in all directions. But it can be done. Give them enough space where they can wonder off (still in your site) but still close enough for you to catch them if need be. Then sit and relax and watch them play.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I see other kids staying close to their parents in the mall or at the park, and am reduced almost to tears thinking I have somehow failed to &quot;do&quot; something or impart some information to them to impress upon either of them how important it is to be near me at important times.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Each child has their own personality and comparing them with other children is not fair to them! Our children will not stay next to us either. It is not part of their make up. They are too curious and adventurous! Adjust the environments you place them in to suite their personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is absolutely exhausting.  I HATE to do it.  I mostly hate to go almost ANYwhere with them because it is like a ridiculous circus act, me running in two separate directions throughout the mall, or the library, park, grocery store, church, WHEREVER.  It&#39;s awful. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t take them to these places if they are not ready for it yet! Is there an enclosed park you can take them to? a gym? Most public elementaries have enclosed playgrounds that are available for use after school hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;REally, I&#39;m sure the neighbors (and anybody else who happens to catch a glimpse of me) think I&#39;m a joke.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who cares? Let them think what they want to! Focus on your children and your family!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But there is no way on earth that I can paint &quot;little by little&quot; or do the sanding and patching that has to be done. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why not? It can be done, even with little ones! Close the door, place a piece of plastic on the floor to protect the flooring, give them little paint brushes and ask them if they would like to help! If they get paint on them &#39;oh well&#39;. Just make sure they start out with old clothes on :) I did this not to long ago and all 3 little one&#39;s had paint in their hair, clothes and body! But they had a blast and I got my older daughter&#39;s room painted! It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;HOWEVER, (this will be one illustration of my husband&#39;s atttitude about things), we paid a painter to remove the border and paint the entire room a sort of &quot;new house beige.&quot;  And my husband bought himself an oversized l-shaped sofa with 4 recliners built in, and a 47&quot; TV with a new theater and sound system.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Good for him! He wanted something done and he made it happen! Sometimes it&#39;s hard not to be jealous or upset with people because they are doing things we wish we could do. But we too can do the things we want! Involve your children in the process if they want to help (and usually little ones do!) They may not do it the exact way you want it done, but they will be enjoying themselves, and the task will be getting done :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I hate TV in general, can&#39;t tolerate the constant &quot;noise.&quot;  I HAVE NOWHERE TO &quot;GO&quot; TO FIND MY PEACE AND SOLACE.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This chapter in your life will be gone before you know it. Believe it or not you will miss the constant &quot;noise&quot; and you will tire of all the peace and solace you will have!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t really appreciate him, no.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You should! He works hard outside of the house so you can stay home with your children (Which is extremely hard work!).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a housekeeper.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want the house clean, and it seems as if no-body else does, Then you are. Maybe it just doesn&#39;t bother him? Most housewives are housekeepers, cooks, seamstresses, nurses, etc. It comes with the territory. If you don&#39;t want to keep the house clean don&#39;t. If it bothers him, he will pick things up :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or a nanny. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You are a mom!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I feel like his parenting is so absolutely and completely divergent from mine, that I am so shocked, disappointed, irritated, and generally dismayed, that I find it difficult to just &quot;turn that all off&quot; (or maybe I should say &quot;turn on&quot; ) and let it all pass while we connect as spouses. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does his parenting skills have to be like yours? It would be nice if they were similar techniques, but they don&#39;t have to be! You cannot control how he parents. Each parent contributes to the raising of their children the way that they feel best.

It is obvious that you don&#39;t feel like your husband could make one correct decision about your children, only your &quot;rules&quot; and decisions are the right ones.

We do not force them to eat. They will eat when they are hungry or when they feel they have the time to eat :) My obsessive behavior of making meals at set times still continues! But that doesn&#39;t mean they have to eat with me! The other night one of our 3 year olds was finally ready to eat at 11 p.m.! So that is when he ate his supper :)<br/>\nWe are just beginning our adventure with radical unschooling. I do feel that the respect we are giving to our children through RU, should also count for anybody else in our lives!

I&#39;m Stephanie. I&#39;m still new at this unschooling thing. I can<br/>\n  relate to a lot of things in your post. When my son was 4 he&#39;d hide in the<br/>\n  big department stores while I had the baby with me in the shopping cart. I<br/>\n  felt like a terrible parent. That my son wouldn&#39;t listen to me and just<br/>\n  behave you know. I don&#39;t have any friends either. My dh works long hours.<br/>\n  When he comes home he likes to eat, shower, and watch tv till he goes to<br/>\n  sleep. Sometimes we barely talk. The kids and I want his attention. We&#39;ve<br/>\n  told him this hundreds of times. He likes the house to be very clean when he<br/>\n  gets home. So the kids and I rush around trying to pick up everything, wash<br/>\n  dishes, etc. I also hate cooking but since I&#39;m the only one who has to, then<br/>\n  I cook. I try out new recipes. I really feel you on the paint colors. We had<br/>\n  a really ugly dark olive green in our living room. Neon yellow in the<br/>\n  kitchen and dining room. Purple in our bedroom rofl. My dh is a painter and<br/>\n  you&#39;d think our house would look nice because of that. Well it took him<br/>\n  probably a year to finally get it all painted. I think the way Dh is with us<br/>\n  really effects us. He&#39;s also not very supportive of unschooling. I<br/>\n  sometimes wonder how I fell in love with him. Anyway, I just want to to tell<br/>\n  you that you are not alone in this!<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Mon, Nov 3, 2008 at 5:32 AM, D Ferguson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xiezmom@...\">xiezmom@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m a little uncertain about whether it is best/most appropriate to<br/>\n  &gt; respond to the entire group, so please tell me if this is offensive. Thank<br/>\n  &gt; you for the advice, guidance, and direction. I don&#39;t know which &quot;area&quot; is<br/>\n  &gt; most important; most upsetting, but I feel drawn to talk about being<br/>\n  &gt; overwhelmed.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m not entirely sure how I can &quot;slow down&quot; or make &quot;less work.&quot; I feel<br/>\n  &gt; like I&#39;m barely treading water daily, what with just making meals, keeping<br/>\n  &gt; enough clean dishes to cook the NEXT meal and eat it, bathe the kids and<br/>\n  &gt; squeeze in personal hygiene time for myself, try to wash some clothes (I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt; not even talking about sheets and towels...), and maybe &quot;DO&quot; something<br/>\n  &gt; (craft, paint, library???). Or &quot;take a walk?&quot; I dread it - my almost 4<br/>\n  &gt; year old doesn&#39;t listen. Not to ANYthing I say. He won&#39;t stay close while<br/>\n  &gt; we walk, rides his bike at a pace I can&#39;t keep up with, doesn&#39;t listen when<br/>\n  &gt; I yell stop or a car is coming, and runs into the house to pout if I &quot;get<br/>\n  &gt; serious&quot; about trying to have him honor my &quot;rules&quot; for being in the streets<br/>\n  &gt; in our neighborhood. And my 18-month old won&#39;t just &quot;sit&quot; in a stroller,<br/>\n  &gt; little &quot;chubby car&quot; or the homemade &quot;carrier&quot; I worked so hard on. If I put<br/>\n  &gt; him down to walk, he pulls his hand from mine or falls to his knees<br/>\n  &gt; in protest, but if I let him just go, he tries to run in the opposite<br/>\n  &gt; direction from me - while my big boy is riding like the wind the other<br/>\n  &gt; direction. It&#39;s exhausting chaos and isn&#39;t even REMOTELY fun. I feel like<br/>\n  &gt; all I&#39;m doing is complaining, but this is very seriously the state of<br/>\n  &gt; things. My kids are like wild horses when you open the gates. I see other<br/>\n  &gt; kids staying close to their parents in the mall or at the park, and am<br/>\n  &gt; reduced almost to tears thinking I have somehow failed to &quot;do&quot; something or<br/>\n  &gt; impart some information to them to impress upon either of them how important<br/>\n  &gt; it is to be near me at important times. It is absolutely exhausting. I<br/>\n  &gt; HATE to do it. I mostly hate to go almost ANYwhere with them because it is<br/>\n  &gt; like a ridiculous circus act, me running in two separate directions<br/>\n  &gt; throughout the mall, or the library, park, grocery store, church, WHEREVER.<br/>\n  &gt; It&#39;s awful. And sadly, I mostly stay inside with them because of it. Even<br/>\n  &gt; in our yard, the &quot;baby&quot; spends most of our outside time running for the<br/>\n  &gt; street REPEATEDLY. And if I turn my back for a minute to try to occupy him<br/>\n  &gt; with an actual toy or game, my big boy rides his bike out of the driveway<br/>\n  &gt; and down the street with me yelling after him while trying to corral my<br/>\n  &gt; baby. It&#39;s a joke. REally, I&#39;m sure the neighbors (and anybody else who<br/>\n  &gt; happens to catch a glimpse of me) think I&#39;m a joke.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; But mostly, my feeling of being overwhelmed is compounded by the house.<br/>\n  &gt; It&#39;s not so much that there is more to clean, because I am also somewhat<br/>\n  &gt; inadequate in that area as well, cleaning on a sort of needed basis only.<br/>\n  &gt; There&#39;s no schedule like, &quot;clean the sinks on one day&quot; or vaccum on another<br/>\n  &gt; day or wash the kitchen floor on another day. I absolutely feel like I am<br/>\n  &gt; treading water with weights on my ankles. But the REAL irritation to me is<br/>\n  &gt; that almost every room in this house is still an absolutely DISGUSTING color<br/>\n  &gt; left from the previous owners. One room has two walls that are neon orange,<br/>\n  &gt; and the other two are bright orange. They used to have wallpaper decals but<br/>\n  &gt; I took them down over time. But there is no way on earth that I can paint<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;little by little&quot; or do the sanding and patching that has to be done. Our<br/>\n  &gt; master bedroom is a disgusting cranberry with a white-trash special border<br/>\n  &gt; along the top of the room that doesn&#39;t even match the<br/>\n  &gt; paint. It is intolerable. When we moved in, the basement was Cocoa cola<br/>\n  &gt; red, with another trashy border along the top of the entire room. HOWEVER,<br/>\n  &gt; (this will be one illustration of my husband&#39;s atttitude about things), we<br/>\n  &gt; paid a painter to remove the border and paint the entire room a sort of &quot;new<br/>\n  &gt; house beige.&quot; And my husband bought himself an oversized l-shaped sofa with<br/>\n  &gt; 4 recliners built in, and a 47&quot; TV with a new theater and sound system. I<br/>\n  &gt; hate TV in general, can&#39;t tolerate the constant &quot;noise.&quot; I HAVE NOWHERE TO<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;GO&quot; TO FIND MY PEACE AND SOLACE. The living room is yellow and maroon (I<br/>\n  &gt; kid you not) with our blue-based furniture and decor in it. Our cranberry<br/>\n  &gt; bedroom has all of my spa blue and orange bedroom accessories. I was<br/>\n  &gt; allowed to have the painters paint the kitchen - was supposed to go from<br/>\n  &gt; seafoam green with a maroon border to plain white, BUT THE GREEN BLED<br/>\n  &gt; THROUGH and when I brought it to the painter&#39;s attention he got<br/>\n  &gt; crappy and left me a gallon of white and told my husband to do it himself.<br/>\n  &gt; Then there&#39;s the issue of the electric stove that my husband said we&#39;d<br/>\n  &gt; change out for a gas one, which hasn&#39;t happened and doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; GOING to. He keeps saying that I don&#39;t cook &quot;all that much&quot; or &quot;all that<br/>\n  &gt; well&quot; so can&#39;t I just deal with it. And our &quot;office room&quot; is a fleshy<br/>\n  &gt; colored pink that is disgusting in daylight, and we are using two folding<br/>\n  &gt; tables to supplement our broken desk that we were supposed to replace with a<br/>\n  &gt; black desk system that I found (to match our black piano).<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; This is all sort of a waste of time for readers, as I complain about<br/>\n  &gt; ridiculous details of my life. I will make changes. I promise you. Your<br/>\n  &gt; posts / suggestions are not wasted. But I feel like without the details of<br/>\n  &gt; what&#39;s bothering me, does it really come together?<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Friends? I feel like I&#39;m just not &quot;clicking&quot; with the people I&#39;m meeting.<br/>\n  &gt; Maybe I expect too much? I don&#39;t know. But I really don&#39;t want to share my<br/>\n  &gt; time or my kids&#39; time with parents who are proud of letting their babies<br/>\n  &gt; just &quot;cry it out.&quot; HOpe I don&#39;t offend anyone here. Or I&#39;m having a hard<br/>\n  &gt; time feeling close to people who keep telling me to wean them saying that<br/>\n  &gt; doing that will make things soooo much eeeeasier for me. It won&#39;t. Or<br/>\n  &gt; people who tell me that I&#39;m selfish for wanting to keep my kids at home<br/>\n  &gt; while they learn. I feel like I&#39;m not meeting people who &quot;understand me&quot; or<br/>\n  &gt; understand that right now I&#39;m a mother FIRST, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily<br/>\n  &gt; mean that I am wrong or unbalanced because I don&#39;t take my kids to the local<br/>\n  &gt; daycare three days a week while I go to Target or enjoy &quot;me&quot; time. I went<br/>\n  &gt; to a get together from a meetup.com mom&#39;s group that I&#39;m in, in my town,<br/>\n  &gt; and upon seeing all the moms ordering drinks with hard liquor<br/>\n  &gt; in them, I asked whether anybody was still nursing anybody. And one of<br/>\n  &gt; them said &quot;oh yea, I&#39;m secretly nrsing my 3 year old.&quot; And I belted out &quot;So<br/>\n  &gt; am I&quot; except that she was joking. That was her idea of a joke. Apart from<br/>\n  &gt; that, I think the group liked me well enough, but you see where things were<br/>\n  &gt; headed. I&#39;m in that online mom&#39;s group, I have attended LLL meetings<br/>\n  &gt; (though they&#39;re about 30 minutes away into the next state - Kansas - and<br/>\n  &gt; there were no chilren similarly aged to my big boy), and am pretty sure<br/>\n  &gt; there is a homeschool group here in Joplin (though it is the religious-based<br/>\n  &gt; faction).<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; What gives me joy / what do we do to get out of the house? Nothing much.<br/>\n  &gt; I recently started taking violin lessons again after about 20 years (I took<br/>\n  &gt; them for 10 years when I was much younger), so that&#39;s a real treat to get<br/>\n  &gt; out of the house not just for the 30 minute lesson, but for the fun of<br/>\n  &gt; driving there and home without children in the car - which means I can put<br/>\n  &gt; all the windows down, listen to whatever music I want to listen to at<br/>\n  &gt; whatever volume I want to... It has been somewhat difficult to make the<br/>\n  &gt; time to practice, though once I did it while nursing my 18month old (which<br/>\n  &gt; wasn&#39;t pretty) just so that I could continue playing instead of stopping to<br/>\n  &gt; hold him. It&#39;s a loud activity that I haven&#39;t been able to do while either<br/>\n  &gt; child is sleeping/napping. My husband initiated a weight loss contest at<br/>\n  &gt; his office and I&#39;m &quot;unofficially&quot; participating, so I&#39;ve been working hard<br/>\n  &gt; to &quot;do the treatmill&quot; almost everyday (we have one in our basement).<br/>\n  &gt; That&#39;s not really a treat and is hard to do with the two kids repeatedly<br/>\n  &gt; trying to get on it while I&#39;m on it, but in the larger scheme of things I do<br/>\n  &gt; feel better after using it. I&#39;d like to learn to knit. Maybe get into a<br/>\n  &gt; group that meets occasionally.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Being appreciated or appreciating my husband? Yeah. I don&#39;t really<br/>\n  &gt; appreciate him, no. I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am the only parent in<br/>\n  &gt; the house. I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a housekeeper. Or a<br/>\n  &gt; nanny. No, I really don&#39;t appreciate much of what he &quot;does for me.&quot; There<br/>\n  &gt; are two issues here, for me. HIs parenting and his spouse-ing. I feel like<br/>\n  &gt; his parenting is so absolutely and completely divergent from mine, that I am<br/>\n  &gt; so shocked, disappointed, irritated, and generally dismayed, that I find it<br/>\n  &gt; difficult to just &quot;turn that all off&quot; (or maybe I should say &quot;turn on&quot; ) and<br/>\n  &gt; let it all pass while we connect as spouses. Which we don&#39;t do. He is a<br/>\n  &gt; hard-worker, with decent morals, motivated by the desire for approval. He<br/>\n  &gt; is an executive level administrator, working for the State of Missouri. I,<br/>\n  &gt; on the other hand, do not have a job - as he reminds me often while trying<br/>\n  &gt; to make a joke of it to make himself seem like &quot;a big<br/>\n  &gt; man.&quot; His ideas about parenting, SCHOOLING, and directing our small<br/>\n  &gt; children are... well, almost opposite of mine. He makes fun of me wanting<br/>\n  &gt; to teach our children at home - saying that I can &quot;barely manage them all<br/>\n  &gt; day long&quot; and hand them off to him when he walks in the door, and then I<br/>\n  &gt; want to keep them home from school? He does not follow &quot;my&quot; procedures for<br/>\n  &gt; running the home. And my big boy has already keyed into the idea that there<br/>\n  &gt; are two sets of rules / ways of doing things: The way mom does things while<br/>\n  &gt; dad is at work, and the way he (the child) can do things when dad is home.<br/>\n  &gt; And I&#39;m talking about EVERYTHING. If I say that he needs to put his socks<br/>\n  &gt; and shoes on to ride his bike(stating a rule of safety), he will then ask<br/>\n  &gt; his dad whether he needs to put his socks on and my husband will say that he<br/>\n  &gt; DOES &quot;because it&#39;s cold out&quot; (implying that if it was warm, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n  &gt; have to wear them) - to which my son will say, &quot;it&#39;s NOT cold<br/>\n  &gt; outside.&quot; So, the whole issue morphs into an argument about the weather,<br/>\n  &gt; rather than a safety rule. I have tried to say that if he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n  &gt; wear socks when it&#39;s cold out, then he will simply be cold (and I typically<br/>\n  &gt; have extra warm/er clothes in the van. But my husband offers &quot;bogus&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; reasons for doing things, especially after I say something. And lately he<br/>\n  &gt; has started telling our son to &quot;ask Momma.&quot; So, the responsibility falls<br/>\n  &gt; back on me. Like the other day I actually had a few minutes where I was<br/>\n  &gt; able to take a bath (without having to bathe the children while I did it)<br/>\n  &gt; and my husband actually sent my big boy into the bathroom to ask me whether<br/>\n  &gt; he could play with a golf ball inside the house! Well, I answered while<br/>\n  &gt; reminding of the house rule (no heavy, hard balls inside the house - it&#39;s<br/>\n  &gt; too much to monitor with an 18month old) and sent him out of the bathroom.<br/>\n  &gt; Minutes later, my husband came in and asked whether I told Xie that<br/>\n  &gt; he could play with the golf ball in the house, because he lied and said<br/>\n  &gt; that mom said it was okay. Well, duh, why would he have to ask me that?<br/>\n  &gt; Does he not know/live by the same house rules that the rest of us do? My<br/>\n  &gt; son knows the rule, but lately has taken to testing my husband&#39;s knowledge<br/>\n  &gt; of all of them. And I don&#39;t care whether somebody wants to tell me that my<br/>\n  &gt; husband is sooooo busy at work all day long that when he comes home he wants<br/>\n  &gt; to &quot;disengage&quot; or decompress or whateve rthe excuse is. He&#39;s not that<br/>\n  &gt; stupid. He&#39;s just lazy. And he&#39;s a lazy parent because he CAN be.<br/>\n  &gt; meaning, because I ALWAYS take up the slack. There is no other choice, for<br/>\n  &gt; me at least. So, every evening our house is chaotic, loud, and<br/>\n  &gt; disorganized, while my kids push the limits of everything and my husband<br/>\n  &gt; tries to squeeze in his sports games and whatever TV show he recorded. DId<br/>\n  &gt; I mention that I hate the tv? And the way it divides our family. My<br/>\n  &gt; husband<br/>\n  &gt; sits staring at the tv with his back against the couch, as if sitting on<br/>\n  &gt; the floor is a magical way to be at the kids&#39; level, but I can hear each of<br/>\n  &gt; them (the kids) yelling for him to look at them - he stares right over them<br/>\n  &gt; at the TV. Lately it&#39;s football - which seems to be on every day anymore<br/>\n  &gt; not just monday nights. And my son/s can be standing on the couch, jumping<br/>\n  &gt; and walking all over it, while my husband sits there with his back against<br/>\n  &gt; it, and I can be in the other room and I&#39;m to believe that I&#39;m the only one<br/>\n  &gt; who can HEAR them getting crazy while he&#39;s sitting RIGHT THERE? I won&#39;t<br/>\n  &gt; believe that. I&#39;m responsible for the lives of two other souls all day long<br/>\n  &gt; and I manage to multi-task or do things in a way that I can still manage<br/>\n  &gt; their safety. And he cannot? It&#39;s downright disgusting to me. So, I end<br/>\n  &gt; up being the one who comes into the room, states the rule (sit down on the<br/>\n  &gt; couch, or GET down) and the kids see me as the &quot;bad guy.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; Plus, if I&#39;m in the tub, I can usually hear the savagery, which continues<br/>\n  &gt; until someone gets hurt. ALWAYS. And then the child who gets hurt ALWAYS<br/>\n  &gt; walks into the bathroom crying, at which point, my private bath time is<br/>\n  &gt; over.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Oh, and it really undermines my daily guidance of our boys when my husband<br/>\n  &gt; uses ghetto slang with them. LIke telling them something is &quot;off the<br/>\n  &gt; schnizzle&quot; (which my almost 4 year old repeats) or teaching him to do some<br/>\n  &gt; vulgar movements after hitting a homerun (which he seems to expect him to do<br/>\n  &gt; after my husband has a big hit at a softball game). Or teaching him to sing<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;Whoop that trick.&quot; I mean, what are we, in junior high? During the day, I<br/>\n  &gt; teach them songs like &quot;Doe a Deer&quot; (From The Sound of Music) or to sing the<br/>\n  &gt; alphabet - in other words, AGE APPROPRIATE things. He is dumbing them down<br/>\n  &gt; with stuff that I would be mortified if either of them ever actually<br/>\n  &gt; parroted my husband in public. It&#39;s not even &quot;stuff&quot; it&#39;s just stupid crap<br/>\n  &gt; that I don&#39;t think they need to be exposed to at this tender age, like<br/>\n  &gt; stupid little quips from the Jim Rome show (sports &quot;talkshow&quot; if you want to<br/>\n  &gt; call it that) that my almost 4 year old repeats with enthusiasm<br/>\n  &gt; after my husband &quot;uses&quot; the lines on him. They have the rest of their<br/>\n  &gt; lives to hear all of that and to decide whether they want to emulate it. I<br/>\n  &gt; don&#39;t know whether the main unschooling tenets include exposing your kids to<br/>\n  &gt; things that are totally age inappropriate, socially inappropriate, and<br/>\n  &gt; politically incorrect in the larger scheme of life, but I&#39;m not a fan of<br/>\n  &gt; that sort of thing. I can&#39;t imagine that&#39;s part of &quot;an education&quot; until the<br/>\n  &gt; child has the skills and life experience to differentiate between desirable<br/>\n  &gt; and undesirable language, behavior, and custom.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m not a victim, that&#39;s not my point of any of this. Rather, I CHOOSE to<br/>\n  &gt; actively parent, to be very aware of my kids and to try to maintain some<br/>\n  &gt; semblance of order in our house, whether it&#39;s enforcement of safety rules<br/>\n  &gt; (like no swinging a sword at your little brother&#39;s head or stopping the<br/>\n  &gt; swordfight until I can help them have one safetly, whereas he would just let<br/>\n  &gt; them go at it until somebody - always the baby - gets hurt), or just plain<br/>\n  &gt; procedures to maximize good hygiene (like accompanying Xie to the toilet<br/>\n  &gt; where I&#39;ve seen that he needs further assistance and guidance in learning to<br/>\n  &gt; pee standing up, because he&#39;s getting it all over himself, the floor, and<br/>\n  &gt; his clothes - whereas my husband just yells to him from the other room<br/>\n  &gt; whether he&#39;s &quot;okay&quot;), or somewhat regularly scheduled eating intervals<br/>\n  &gt; (somehow on weekends he doesn&#39;t present food at least three times a day<br/>\n  &gt; because he says he isn&#39;t hungry - hello, they&#39;re children who typically eat<br/>\n  &gt; three<br/>\n  &gt; times a day during the week, and when he doesn&#39;t offer them something to<br/>\n  &gt; eat, the baby comes to me to nurse). And really, despite the level of<br/>\n  &gt; detail here, I&#39;m not so difficult to get along with that I can&#39;t make<br/>\n  &gt; friends. I used to have a nice network of friends when we lived in Tucson,<br/>\n  &gt; and I made friends quickly with a family that lived across the street from<br/>\n  &gt; the house we had in Illinois briefly, and I&#39;ve maintained some of those<br/>\n  &gt; friendships while we&#39;ve moved back and forth across the country like<br/>\n  &gt; gypsies. I&#39;m just feeling like there is no substitute for having a<br/>\n  &gt; girlfriend over, even with her kids, during the day and being able to get a<br/>\n  &gt; few things done while she&#39;s here because she can help with my chilren or<br/>\n  &gt; help ME.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I do value your offer of virtual friendship. And I was in tears reading<br/>\n  &gt; your posts, touched by your warmth. And I WILL do some of the reading you<br/>\n  &gt; suggested. And I won&#39;t forget to savor the &quot;good moments&quot; with my babies.<br/>\n  &gt; I WILL make adjustments. I&#39;m not a lost cause. There are just times when I<br/>\n  &gt; feel like the weight of the world is on MY shoulders, alone, and would love<br/>\n  &gt; to have a mother, grandmother, husband, close friend who could come over, to<br/>\n  &gt; just &quot;fight the good fight&quot; WITH me. Instead of feeling like a mule chained<br/>\n  &gt; to a heavy load, wishing I was a big powerful clydesdale (spelling?) pulling<br/>\n  &gt; on a team that would get us to where we&#39;re going so much faster that we&#39;d<br/>\n  &gt; probably have time to run wild in the field and eat the tall grass. And my<br/>\n  &gt; main concern is that all of my struggles, mental, emotional, whatever, are<br/>\n  &gt; being &quot;passed onto&quot; my boys. The bottom line is that I want to change,<br/>\n  &gt; better myself, make a better environment for them,<br/>\n  &gt; and to lay a better framework for helping them learn the things they need<br/>\n  &gt; to know in order to get to where they want in their lives.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m actually a lawyer. I came from a family of divorce and remarriage of<br/>\n  &gt; both parents. My father was especially controlling, and continues to try to<br/>\n  &gt; be. His family is Italian, Catholic, and not formally educated (except for<br/>\n  &gt; me and a few other same generation cousins) and maintained a strict<br/>\n  &gt; hierarchy of governance that was headed by his mother, until her death two<br/>\n  &gt; Augusts ago. There were plenty of family rules, plenty of SHOULDS, and<br/>\n  &gt; CAN&#39;Ts. I became a lawyer to &quot;show them&quot; that I COULD. My mother (who died<br/>\n  &gt; in 1991) was Armenian, from a differently controlling family that stressed<br/>\n  &gt; conformity to overarching &quot;American&quot; ways - including a husband who worked,<br/>\n  &gt; a stay at home mother with beauty school training who could &quot;do hair&quot; in the<br/>\n  &gt; basement for money on the side, and who took pride in cooking, cleaning, and<br/>\n  &gt; getting the children to and from school. My mother divorced my father,<br/>\n  &gt; never went to beauty school, remarried a man with a couple<br/>\n  &gt; kids, had my brother, and initiated our move in the 1980&#39;s from Illinois to<br/>\n  &gt; Arizona, after which &quot;The FAmily&quot; stopped talking to her. She was a<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;maverick.&quot; And so, I like to think that I got the best of both worlds from<br/>\n  &gt; my parents. Though I have spent considerable time (and money) in<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;counseling&quot; trying to forge my OWN path.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; And SO, here I am, trying to unschool mySELF (unsure of this context) and<br/>\n  &gt; wanting more, or should I say LESS, for my own children... wanting them to<br/>\n  &gt; find their own right path without forcing them down MY &quot;right path.&quot; I&#39;m<br/>\n  &gt; discovering that I&#39;m not entirely sure what is my right path.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; Okay, getting too deep for 4:30am and probably alienating members. I&#39;ll<br/>\n  &gt; stop. And I&#39;m going back to bed. For now.<br/>\n  &gt; Very sincerely,<br/>\n  &gt; Deborah.<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  No virus found in this incoming message.<br/>\n  Checked by AVG - <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.avg.com\">http://www.avg.com</a> <br/>\n  Version: 8.0.175 / Virus Database: 270.9.0/1771 - Release Date: 11/6/2008 7:58 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262940054,"authorName":"Stephanie Tavera","from":"&quot;Stephanie Tavera&quot; &lt;lilmamibella@...&gt;","profile":"earthangel21_2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1225981161","msgId":36968,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExZmRkNTEwMDgxMTA2MDYxOXI0MDVjZmFhNXZiMWY0MGRiMzNiZjEyZjhmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MTMwMi44NDQ2Mi5xbUB3ZWIzNzQwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY1MTMwMi44NDQ2Mi5xbUB3ZWIzNzQwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36959,"nextInTopic":36969,"prevInTime":36967,"nextInTime":36969,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Deborah!

I can<br/>\nrelate to a lot of things in your post. When my son was 4 he&#39;d hide in the<br/>\nbig department stores while I had the baby with me in the shopping cart. I<br/>\nfelt like a terrible parent. That my son wouldn&#39;t listen to me and just<br/>\nbehave you know. I don&#39;t have any friends either. My dh works long hours.<br/>\nWhen he comes home he likes to eat, shower, and watch tv till he goes to<br/>\nsleep. Sometimes we barely talk. The kids and I want his attention. We&#39;ve<br/>\ntold him this hundreds of times. He likes the house to be very clean when he<br/>\ngets home. So the kids and I rush around trying to pick up everything, wash<br/>\ndishes, etc. I also hate cooking but since I&#39;m the only one who has to, then<br/>\nI cook. I try out new recipes. I really feel you on the paint colors. We had<br/>\na really ugly dark olive green in our living room. Neon yellow in the<br/>\nkitchen and dining room. Purple in our bedroom rofl. My dh is a painter and<br/>\nyou&#39;d think our house would look nice because of that. Well it took him<br/>\nprobably a year to finally get it all painted. I think the way Dh is with us<br/>\nreally effects us. He&#39;s also not very supportive of unschooling.  I<br/>\nsometimes wonder how I fell in love with him. Anyway, I just want to to tell<br/>\nyou that you are not alone in this!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Nov 3, 2008 at 5:32 AM, D Ferguson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:xiezmom@...\">xiezmom@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   I&#39;m a little uncertain about whether it is best/most appropriate to<br/>\n&gt; respond to the entire group, so please tell me if this is offensive.  Thank<br/>\n&gt; you for the advice, guidance, and direction.  I don&#39;t know which &quot;area&quot; is<br/>\n&gt; most important; most upsetting, but I feel drawn to talk about being<br/>\n&gt; overwhelmed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not entirely sure how I can &quot;slow down&quot; or make &quot;less work.&quot;  I feel<br/>\n&gt; like I&#39;m barely treading water daily, what with just making meals, keeping<br/>\n&gt; enough clean dishes to cook the NEXT meal and eat it, bathe the kids and<br/>\n&gt; squeeze in personal hygiene time for myself, try to wash some clothes (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; not even talking about sheets and towels...), and maybe &quot;DO&quot; something<br/>\n&gt; (craft, paint, library???).  Or &quot;take a walk?&quot;  I dread it - my almost 4<br/>\n&gt; year old doesn&#39;t listen.  Not to ANYthing I say.  He won&#39;t stay close while<br/>\n&gt; we walk, rides his bike at a pace I can&#39;t keep up with, doesn&#39;t listen when<br/>\n&gt; I yell stop or a car is coming, and runs into the house to pout if I &quot;get<br/>\n&gt; serious&quot; about trying to have him honor my &quot;rules&quot; for being in the streets<br/>\n&gt; in our neighborhood.  And my 18-month old won&#39;t just &quot;sit&quot; in a stroller,<br/>\n&gt; little &quot;chubby car&quot; or the homemade &quot;carrier&quot; I worked so hard on.  If I put<br/>\n&gt; him down to walk, he pulls his hand from mine or falls to his knees<br/>\n&gt; in protest, but if I let him just go, he tries to run in the opposite<br/>\n&gt; direction from me - while my big boy is riding like the wind the other<br/>\n&gt; direction.  It&#39;s exhausting chaos and isn&#39;t even REMOTELY fun.  I feel like<br/>\n&gt; all I&#39;m doing is complaining, but this is very seriously the state of<br/>\n&gt; things.  My kids are like wild horses when you open the gates.  I see other<br/>\n&gt; kids staying close to their parents in the mall or at the park, and am<br/>\n&gt; reduced almost to tears thinking I have somehow failed to &quot;do&quot; something or<br/>\n&gt; impart some information to them to impress upon either of them how important<br/>\n&gt; it is to be near me at important times.  It is absolutely exhausting.  I<br/>\n&gt; HATE to do it.  I mostly hate to go almost ANYwhere with them because it is<br/>\n&gt; like a ridiculous circus act, me running in two separate directions<br/>\n&gt; throughout the mall, or the library, park, grocery store, church, WHEREVER.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s awful.  And sadly, I mostly stay inside with them because of it.  Even<br/>\n&gt; in our yard, the &quot;baby&quot; spends most of our outside time running for the<br/>\n&gt; street REPEATEDLY.  And if I turn my back for a minute to try to occupy him<br/>\n&gt; with an actual toy or game, my big boy rides his bike out of the driveway<br/>\n&gt; and down the street with me yelling after him while trying to corral my<br/>\n&gt; baby.  It&#39;s a joke.  REally, I&#39;m sure the neighbors (and anybody else who<br/>\n&gt; happens to catch a glimpse of me) think I&#39;m a joke.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But mostly, my feeling of being overwhelmed is compounded by the house.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s not so much that there is more to clean, because I am also somewhat<br/>\n&gt; inadequate in that area as well, cleaning on a sort of needed basis only.<br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s no schedule like, &quot;clean the sinks on one day&quot; or vaccum on another<br/>\n&gt; day or wash the kitchen floor on another day.  I absolutely feel like I am<br/>\n&gt; treading water with weights on my ankles.  But the REAL irritation to me is<br/>\n&gt; that almost every room in this house is still an absolutely DISGUSTING color<br/>\n&gt; left from the previous owners.  One room has two walls that are neon orange,<br/>\n&gt; and the other two are bright orange.  They used to have wallpaper decals but<br/>\n&gt; I took them down over time.  But there is no way on earth that I can paint<br/>\n&gt; &quot;little by little&quot; or do the sanding and patching that has to be done.  Our<br/>\n&gt; master bedroom is a disgusting cranberry with a white-trash special border<br/>\n&gt; along the top of the room that doesn&#39;t even match the<br/>\n&gt; paint.  It is intolerable.  When we moved in, the basement was Cocoa cola<br/>\n&gt; red, with another trashy border along the top of the entire room.  HOWEVER,<br/>\n&gt; (this will be one illustration of my husband&#39;s atttitude about things), we<br/>\n&gt; paid a painter to remove the border and paint the entire room a sort of &quot;new<br/>\n&gt; house beige.&quot;  And my husband bought himself an oversized l-shaped sofa with<br/>\n&gt; 4 recliners built in, and a 47&quot; TV with a new theater and sound system.  I<br/>\n&gt; hate TV in general, can&#39;t tolerate the constant &quot;noise.&quot;  I HAVE NOWHERE TO<br/>\n&gt; &quot;GO&quot; TO FIND MY PEACE AND SOLACE.  The living room is yellow and maroon (I<br/>\n&gt; kid you not) with our blue-based furniture and decor in it.  Our cranberry<br/>\n&gt; bedroom has all of my spa blue and orange bedroom accessories.  I was<br/>\n&gt; allowed to have the painters paint the kitchen - was supposed to go from<br/>\n&gt; seafoam green with a maroon border to plain white, BUT THE GREEN BLED<br/>\n&gt; THROUGH and when I brought it to the painter&#39;s attention he got<br/>\n&gt; crappy and left me a gallon of white and told my husband to do it himself.<br/>\n&gt; Then there&#39;s the issue of the electric stove that my husband said we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; change out for a gas one, which hasn&#39;t happened and doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; GOING to.  He keeps saying that I don&#39;t cook &quot;all that much&quot; or &quot;all that<br/>\n&gt; well&quot; so can&#39;t I just deal with it.  And our &quot;office room&quot; is a fleshy<br/>\n&gt; colored pink that is disgusting in daylight, and we are using two folding<br/>\n&gt; tables to supplement our broken desk that we were supposed to replace with a<br/>\n&gt; black desk system that I found (to match our black piano).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This is all sort of a waste of time for readers, as I complain about<br/>\n&gt; ridiculous details of my life.  I will make changes.  I promise you.  Your<br/>\n&gt; posts / suggestions are not wasted.  But I feel like without the details of<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;s bothering me, does it really come together?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Friends?  I feel like I&#39;m just not &quot;clicking&quot; with the people I&#39;m meeting.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I expect too much?  I don&#39;t know.  But I really don&#39;t want to share my<br/>\n&gt; time or my kids&#39; time with parents who are proud of letting their babies<br/>\n&gt; just &quot;cry it out.&quot;  HOpe I don&#39;t offend anyone here.  Or I&#39;m having a hard<br/>\n&gt; time feeling close to people who keep telling me to wean them saying that<br/>\n&gt; doing that will make things soooo much eeeeasier for me.  It won&#39;t.  Or<br/>\n&gt; people who tell me that I&#39;m selfish for wanting to keep my kids at home<br/>\n&gt; while they learn.  I feel like I&#39;m not meeting people who &quot;understand me&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; understand that right now I&#39;m a mother FIRST, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily<br/>\n&gt; mean that I am wrong or unbalanced because I don&#39;t take my kids to the local<br/>\n&gt; daycare three days a week while I go to Target or enjoy &quot;me&quot; time.  I went<br/>\n&gt; to a get together from a meetup.com mom&#39;s group that I&#39;m in, in my town,<br/>\n&gt; and upon seeing all the moms ordering drinks with hard liquor<br/>\n&gt; in them, I asked whether anybody was still nursing anybody.  And one of<br/>\n&gt; them said &quot;oh yea, I&#39;m secretly nrsing my 3 year old.&quot;  And I belted out &quot;So<br/>\n&gt; am I&quot; except that she was joking.  That was her idea of a joke.  Apart from<br/>\n&gt; that, I think the group liked me well enough, but you see where things were<br/>\n&gt; headed.  I&#39;m in that online mom&#39;s group, I have attended LLL meetings<br/>\n&gt; (though they&#39;re about 30 minutes away into the next state - Kansas - and<br/>\n&gt; there were no chilren similarly aged to my big boy), and am pretty sure<br/>\n&gt; there is a homeschool group here in Joplin (though it is the religious-based<br/>\n&gt; faction).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What gives me joy / what do we do to get out of the house?  Nothing much.<br/>\n&gt; I recently started taking violin lessons again after about 20 years (I took<br/>\n&gt; them for 10 years when I was much younger), so that&#39;s a real treat to get<br/>\n&gt; out of the house not just for the 30 minute lesson, but for the fun of<br/>\n&gt; driving there and home without children in the car - which means I can put<br/>\n&gt; all the windows down, listen to whatever music I want to listen to at<br/>\n&gt; whatever volume I want to...  It has been somewhat difficult to make the<br/>\n&gt; time to practice, though once I did it while nursing my 18month old (which<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t pretty) just so that I could continue playing instead of stopping to<br/>\n&gt; hold him.  It&#39;s a loud activity that I haven&#39;t been able to do while either<br/>\n&gt; child is sleeping/napping.  My husband initiated a weight loss contest at<br/>\n&gt; his office and I&#39;m &quot;unofficially&quot; participating, so I&#39;ve been working hard<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;do the treatmill&quot; almost everyday (we have one in our basement).<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not really a treat and is hard to do with the two kids repeatedly<br/>\n&gt; trying to get on it while I&#39;m on it, but in the larger scheme of things I do<br/>\n&gt; feel better after using it.  I&#39;d like to learn to knit.  Maybe get into a<br/>\n&gt; group that meets occasionally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Being appreciated or appreciating my husband?  Yeah.  I don&#39;t really<br/>\n&gt; appreciate him, no.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am the only parent in<br/>\n&gt; the house.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a housekeeper.  Or a<br/>\n&gt; nanny.  No, I really don&#39;t appreciate much of what he &quot;does for me.&quot;  There<br/>\n&gt; are two issues here, for me.  HIs parenting and his spouse-ing.  I feel like<br/>\n&gt; his parenting is so absolutely and completely divergent from mine, that I am<br/>\n&gt; so shocked, disappointed, irritated, and generally dismayed, that I find it<br/>\n&gt; difficult to just &quot;turn that all off&quot; (or maybe I should say &quot;turn on&quot; ) and<br/>\n&gt; let it all pass while we connect as spouses.  Which we don&#39;t do.  He is a<br/>\n&gt; hard-worker, with decent morals, motivated by the desire for approval.  He<br/>\n&gt; is an executive level administrator, working for the State of Missouri.  I,<br/>\n&gt; on the other hand, do not have a job - as he reminds me often while trying<br/>\n&gt; to make a joke of it to make himself seem like &quot;a big<br/>\n&gt; man.&quot;  His ideas about parenting, SCHOOLING, and directing our small<br/>\n&gt; children are... well, almost opposite of mine.  He makes fun of me wanting<br/>\n&gt; to teach our children at home - saying that I can &quot;barely manage them all<br/>\n&gt; day long&quot; and hand them off to him when he walks in the door, and then I<br/>\n&gt; want to keep them home from school?  He does not follow &quot;my&quot; procedures for<br/>\n&gt; running the home.  And my big boy has already keyed into the idea that there<br/>\n&gt; are two sets of rules / ways of doing things:  The way mom does things while<br/>\n&gt; dad is at work, and the way he (the child) can do things when dad is home.<br/>\n&gt; And I&#39;m talking about EVERYTHING.  If I say that he needs to put his socks<br/>\n&gt; and shoes on to ride his bike(stating a rule of safety), he will then ask<br/>\n&gt; his dad whether he needs to put his socks on and my husband will say that he<br/>\n&gt; DOES &quot;because it&#39;s cold out&quot; (implying that if it was warm, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have to wear them) - to which my son will say, &quot;it&#39;s NOT cold<br/>\n&gt; outside.&quot;  So, the whole issue morphs into an argument about the weather,<br/>\n&gt; rather than a safety rule.  I have tried to say that if he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; wear socks when it&#39;s cold out, then he will simply be cold (and I typically<br/>\n&gt; have extra warm/er clothes in the van.  But my husband offers &quot;bogus&quot;<br/>\n&gt; reasons for doing things, especially after I say something.  And lately he<br/>\n&gt; has started telling our son to &quot;ask Momma.&quot;  So, the responsibility falls<br/>\n&gt; back on me.  Like the other day I actually had a few minutes where I was<br/>\n&gt; able to take a bath (without having to bathe the children while I did it)<br/>\n&gt; and my husband actually sent my big boy into the bathroom to ask me whether<br/>\n&gt; he could play with a golf ball inside the house!  Well, I answered while<br/>\n&gt; reminding of the house rule (no heavy, hard balls inside the house - it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too much to monitor with an 18month old) and sent him out of the bathroom.<br/>\n&gt; Minutes later, my husband came in and asked whether I told Xie that<br/>\n&gt; he could play with the golf ball in the house, because he lied and said<br/>\n&gt; that mom said it was okay.  Well, duh, why would he have to ask me that?<br/>\n&gt; Does he not know/live by the same house rules that the rest of us do?  My<br/>\n&gt; son knows the rule, but lately has taken to testing my husband&#39;s knowledge<br/>\n&gt; of all of them.  And I don&#39;t care whether somebody wants to tell me that my<br/>\n&gt; husband is sooooo busy at work all day long that when he comes home he wants<br/>\n&gt; to &quot;disengage&quot; or decompress or whateve rthe excuse is.  He&#39;s not that<br/>\n&gt; stupid.  He&#39;s just lazy.  And he&#39;s a lazy parent because he CAN be.<br/>\n&gt; meaning, because I ALWAYS take up the slack.  There is no other choice, for<br/>\n&gt; me at least.  So, every evening our house is chaotic, loud, and<br/>\n&gt; disorganized, while my kids push the limits of everything and my husband<br/>\n&gt; tries to squeeze in his sports games and whatever TV show he recorded.  DId<br/>\n&gt; I mention that I hate the tv?  And the way it divides our family.  My<br/>\n&gt; husband<br/>\n&gt; sits staring at the tv with his back against the couch, as if sitting on<br/>\n&gt; the floor is a magical way to be at the kids&#39; level, but I can hear each of<br/>\n&gt; them (the kids) yelling for him to look at them - he stares right over them<br/>\n&gt; at the TV.  Lately it&#39;s football - which seems to be on every day anymore<br/>\n&gt; not just monday nights.  And my son/s can be standing on the couch, jumping<br/>\n&gt; and walking all over it, while my husband sits there with his back against<br/>\n&gt; it, and I can be in the other room and I&#39;m to believe that I&#39;m the only one<br/>\n&gt; who can HEAR them getting crazy while he&#39;s sitting RIGHT THERE?  I won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; believe that.  I&#39;m responsible for the lives of two other souls all day long<br/>\n&gt; and I manage to multi-task or do things in a way that I can still manage<br/>\n&gt; their safety.  And he cannot?  It&#39;s downright disgusting to me.  So, I end<br/>\n&gt; up being the one who comes into the room, states the rule (sit down on the<br/>\n&gt; couch, or GET down) and the kids see me as the &quot;bad guy.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Plus, if I&#39;m in the tub, I can usually hear the savagery, which continues<br/>\n&gt; until someone gets hurt. ALWAYS.  And then the child who gets hurt ALWAYS<br/>\n&gt; walks into the bathroom crying, at which point, my private bath time is<br/>\n&gt; over.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh, and it really undermines my daily guidance of our boys when my husband<br/>\n&gt; uses ghetto slang with them. LIke telling them something is &quot;off the<br/>\n&gt; schnizzle&quot; (which my almost 4 year old repeats) or teaching him to do some<br/>\n&gt; vulgar movements after hitting a homerun (which he seems to expect him to do<br/>\n&gt; after my husband has a big hit at a softball game).  Or teaching him to sing<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Whoop that trick.&quot;  I mean, what are we, in junior high?  During the day, I<br/>\n&gt; teach them songs like &quot;Doe a Deer&quot; (From The Sound of Music) or to sing the<br/>\n&gt; alphabet - in other words, AGE APPROPRIATE things.  He is dumbing them down<br/>\n&gt; with stuff that I would be mortified if either of them ever actually<br/>\n&gt; parroted my husband in public.  It&#39;s not even &quot;stuff&quot; it&#39;s just stupid crap<br/>\n&gt; that I don&#39;t think they need to be exposed to at this tender age, like<br/>\n&gt; stupid little quips from the Jim Rome show (sports &quot;talkshow&quot; if you want to<br/>\n&gt; call it that) that my almost 4 year old repeats with enthusiasm<br/>\n&gt; after my husband &quot;uses&quot; the lines on him.  They have the rest of their<br/>\n&gt; lives to hear all of that and to decide whether they want to emulate it.  I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know whether the main unschooling tenets include exposing your kids to<br/>\n&gt; things that are totally age inappropriate, socially inappropriate, and<br/>\n&gt; politically incorrect in the larger scheme of life, but I&#39;m not a fan of<br/>\n&gt; that sort of thing.  I can&#39;t imagine that&#39;s part of &quot;an education&quot; until the<br/>\n&gt; child has the skills and life experience to differentiate between desirable<br/>\n&gt; and undesirable language, behavior, and custom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not a victim, that&#39;s not my point of any of this.  Rather, I CHOOSE to<br/>\n&gt; actively parent, to be very aware of my kids and to try to maintain some<br/>\n&gt; semblance of order in our house, whether it&#39;s enforcement of safety rules<br/>\n&gt; (like no swinging a sword at your little brother&#39;s head or stopping the<br/>\n&gt; swordfight until I can help them have one safetly, whereas he would just let<br/>\n&gt; them go at it until somebody - always the baby - gets hurt), or just plain<br/>\n&gt; procedures to maximize good hygiene (like accompanying Xie to the toilet<br/>\n&gt; where I&#39;ve seen that he needs further assistance and guidance in learning to<br/>\n&gt; pee standing up, because he&#39;s getting it all over himself, the floor, and<br/>\n&gt; his clothes - whereas my husband just yells to him from the other room<br/>\n&gt; whether he&#39;s &quot;okay&quot;), or somewhat regularly scheduled eating intervals<br/>\n&gt; (somehow on weekends he doesn&#39;t present food at least three times a day<br/>\n&gt; because he says he isn&#39;t hungry - hello, they&#39;re children who typically eat<br/>\n&gt; three<br/>\n&gt; times a day during the week, and when he doesn&#39;t offer them something to<br/>\n&gt; eat, the baby comes to me to nurse).  And really, despite the level of<br/>\n&gt; detail here, I&#39;m not so difficult to get along with that I can&#39;t make<br/>\n&gt; friends.  I used to have a nice network of friends when we lived in Tucson,<br/>\n&gt; and I made friends quickly with a family that lived across the street from<br/>\n&gt; the house we had in Illinois briefly, and I&#39;ve maintained some of those<br/>\n&gt; friendships while we&#39;ve moved back and forth across the country like<br/>\n&gt; gypsies.  I&#39;m just feeling like there is no substitute for having a<br/>\n&gt; girlfriend over, even with her kids, during the day and being able to get a<br/>\n&gt; few things done while she&#39;s here because she can help with my chilren or<br/>\n&gt; help ME.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do value your offer of virtual friendship.  And I was in tears reading<br/>\n&gt; your posts, touched by your warmth.  And I WILL do some of the reading you<br/>\n&gt; suggested.  And I won&#39;t forget to savor the &quot;good moments&quot; with my babies.<br/>\n&gt; I WILL make adjustments.  I&#39;m not a lost cause.  There are just times when I<br/>\n&gt; feel like the weight of the world is on MY shoulders, alone, and would love<br/>\n&gt; to have a mother, grandmother, husband, close friend who could come over, to<br/>\n&gt; just &quot;fight the good fight&quot; WITH me.  Instead of feeling like a mule chained<br/>\n&gt; to a heavy load, wishing I was a big powerful clydesdale (spelling?) pulling<br/>\n&gt; on a team that would get us to where we&#39;re going so much faster that we&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; probably have time to run wild in the field and eat the tall grass.  And my<br/>\n&gt; main concern is that all of my struggles, mental, emotional, whatever, are<br/>\n&gt; being &quot;passed onto&quot; my boys.  The bottom line is that I want to change,<br/>\n&gt; better myself, make a better environment for them,<br/>\n&gt; and to lay a better framework for helping them learn the things they need<br/>\n&gt; to know in order to get to where they want in their lives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m actually a lawyer.  I came from a family of divorce and remarriage of<br/>\n&gt; both parents.  My father was especially controlling, and continues to try to<br/>\n&gt; be.  His family is Italian, Catholic, and not formally educated (except for<br/>\n&gt; me and a few other same generation cousins) and maintained a strict<br/>\n&gt; hierarchy of governance that was headed by his mother, until her death two<br/>\n&gt; Augusts ago.  There were plenty of family rules, plenty of SHOULDS, and<br/>\n&gt; CAN&#39;Ts.  I became a lawyer to &quot;show them&quot; that I COULD.  My mother (who died<br/>\n&gt; in 1991) was Armenian, from a differently controlling family that stressed<br/>\n&gt; conformity to overarching &quot;American&quot; ways - including a husband who worked,<br/>\n&gt; a stay at home mother with beauty school training who could &quot;do hair&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; basement for money on the side, and who took pride in cooking, cleaning, and<br/>\n&gt; getting the children to and from school.  My mother divorced my father,<br/>\n&gt; never went to beauty school, remarried a man with a couple<br/>\n&gt; kids, had my brother, and initiated our move in the 1980&#39;s from Illinois to<br/>\n&gt; Arizona, after which &quot;The FAmily&quot; stopped talking to her.  She was a<br/>\n&gt; &quot;maverick.&quot;  And so, I like to think that I got the best of both worlds from<br/>\n&gt; my parents.  Though I have spent considerable time (and money) in<br/>\n&gt; &quot;counseling&quot; trying to forge my OWN path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And SO, here I am, trying to unschool mySELF (unsure of this context) and<br/>\n&gt; wanting more, or should I say LESS, for my own children... wanting them to<br/>\n&gt; find their own right path without forcing them down MY &quot;right path.&quot;  I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; discovering that I&#39;m not entirely sure what is my right path.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Okay, getting too deep for 4:30am and probably alienating members.  I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; stop.  And I&#39;m going back to bed.  For now.<br/>\n&gt; Very sincerely,<br/>\n&gt; Deborah.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99005687,"authorName":"Sherri","from":"&quot;Sherri&quot; &lt;sherrildr@...&gt;","profile":"sherrildr2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re:On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1225756024","msgId":36955,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1MzlGMDQzOUVBMzRBNDFBNTc4NUNBODQ1MzFCQUYzQFNoZXJCZWFyPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNFQUY5RTM1MjFERDRBNjhCMzk1RUVFMzE3OTVCNUY1QE1jQ2hlc25leVBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PDNFQUY5RTM1MjFERDRBNjhCMzk1RUVFMzE3OTVCNUY1QE1jQ2hlc25leVBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":36951,"nextInTopic":36959,"prevInTime":36954,"nextInTime":36956,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s a lot to think about.

I will say that I wanted to home school our<br/>\nchild from birth.  My DH was against it and due to a chronic illness on my<br/>\npart, I gave in and put DD in prek and she then went on to K-3 grades.  What<br/>\nI found out is I should have gone with my gut.  My child was stressed and<br/>\nunhappy in school.  I didn&#39;t see another way with my condition.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the end of 2nd grade she had health issues directly related to<br/>\nbullying at school.  We went on medical supervision and found her a new<br/>\nschool.  We went to the new school and got a horrible teacher.  My daughter<br/>\nhas ibs and asthma, she missed 26 days of school because of stress induced<br/>\nillness.  The final straw was the wild witch teacher, (I have other names<br/>\nfor her) dumping her desk out as she got angry that she moved to slowly to<br/>\nget a book.  The teacher then yelled at her while the other children watched<br/>\nher in horror.  This happened Feb 25, 2008.  DD has not been back to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking her out of school was not convenient for us. I needed to have major<br/>\nsurgery and needed it at a hospital 2 hours away.  However, children aren&#39;t<br/>\nmeant to be convenient.  We tried a school in a box, we liked the world<br/>\nhistory aspect, skipped the religion and did what we wanted.  I had been<br/>\nreading all summer about unschooling and was really into the idea.  I did<br/>\nbuy another another school in the box, that last a week.  If I could find<br/>\nthe receipt I would send it back.  However, DD does love all the books and<br/>\ncool stuff.  We talked to people in homeschooling groups and realized not to<br/>\nworry so much about a label.  We are in a deschooling unschooling do what<br/>\nFaith wants place.  We are going to homeschooling groups.  Faith wants to<br/>\nunderstand Shakespeare and so we are following her passion.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is playing lots with friends after school, and lots of computer games.<br/>\nHowever, she is happier then she has ever been in her entire life.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been some really really stressful times for both of us.  I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t always said the right things.  However, I do talk to my child and<br/>\napologize when I am in the wrong and I work on my behavior.  We are now<br/>\nradical unschooling and it isn&#39;t easy to make the transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my point is this, if in your gut you want to unschool your children,<br/>\nor homeschool your children, you should follow your gut.  If I had it to do<br/>\nover again I would stop listening to all the nay sayers and find a local<br/>\nunschooler or even homeschool teen to help out a couple of hours a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week I got to experience my child and 24/7 with out Daddy from Sunday<br/>\nnight till late thrusday.  I was frustrated but I wouldn&#39;t trade the time<br/>\nwith my child for school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":260333665,"authorName":"D Ferguson","from":"D Ferguson &lt;xiezmom@...&gt;","profile":"xiezmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1225708343","msgId":36959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MTMwMi44NDQ2Mi5xbUB3ZWIzNzQwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36955,"nextInTopic":36968,"prevInTime":36958,"nextInTime":36960,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a little uncertain about whether it is best/most appropriate to respond to the entire group, so please tell me if this is offensive.  Thank you for the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-873809018\">I&#39;m a little uncertain about whether it is best/most appropriate to respond to the entire group, so please tell me if this is offensive.  Thank you for the advice, guidance, and direction.  I don&#39;t know which &quot;area&quot; is most important; most upsetting, but I feel drawn to talk about being overwhelmed.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not entirely sure how I can &quot;slow down&quot; or make &quot;less work.&quot;  I feel like I&#39;m barely treading water daily, what with just making meals, keeping enough clean dishes to cook the NEXT meal and eat it, bathe the kids and squeeze in personal hygiene time for myself, try to wash some clothes (I&#39;m not even talking about sheets and towels...), and maybe &quot;DO&quot; something (craft, paint, library???).  Or &quot;take a walk?&quot;  I dread it - my almost 4 year old doesn&#39;t listen.  Not to ANYthing I say.  He won&#39;t stay close while we walk, rides his bike at a pace I can&#39;t keep up with, doesn&#39;t listen when I yell stop or a car is coming, and runs into the house to pout if I &quot;get serious&quot; about trying to have him honor my &quot;rules&quot; for being in the streets in our neighborhood.  And my 18-month old won&#39;t just &quot;sit&quot; in a stroller, little &quot;chubby car&quot; or the homemade &quot;carrier&quot; I worked so hard on.  If I put him down to walk, he pulls his hand from mine or falls to his knees<br/>\n in protest, but if I let him just go, he tries to run in the opposite direction from me - while my big boy is riding like the wind the other direction.  It&#39;s exhausting chaos and isn&#39;t even REMOTELY fun.  I feel like all I&#39;m doing is complaining, but this is very seriously the state of things.  My kids are like wild horses when you open the gates.  I see other kids staying close to their parents in the mall or at the park, and am reduced almost to tears thinking I have somehow failed to &quot;do&quot; something or impart some information to them to impress upon either of them how important it is to be near me at important times.  It is absolutely exhausting.  I HATE to do it.  I mostly hate to go almost ANYwhere with them because it is like a ridiculous circus act, me running in two separate directions throughout the mall, or the library, park, grocery store, church, WHEREVER.  It&#39;s awful.  And sadly, I mostly stay inside with them because of it.  Even<br/>\n in our yard, the &quot;baby&quot; spends most of our outside time running for the street REPEATEDLY.  And if I turn my back for a minute to try to occupy him with an actual toy or game, my big boy rides his bike out of the driveway and down the street with me yelling after him while trying to corral my baby.  It&#39;s a joke.  REally, I&#39;m sure the neighbors (and anybody else who happens to catch a glimpse of me) think I&#39;m a joke.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut mostly, my feeling of being overwhelmed is compounded by the house.  It&#39;s not so much that there is more to clean, because I am also somewhat inadequate in that area as well, cleaning on a sort of needed basis only.  There&#39;s no schedule like, &quot;clean the sinks on one day&quot; or vaccum on another day or wash the kitchen floor on another day.  I absolutely feel like I am treading water with weights on my ankles.  But the REAL irritation to me is that almost every room in this house is still an absolutely DISGUSTING color left from the previous owners.  One room has two walls that are neon orange, and the other two are bright orange.  They used to have wallpaper decals but I took them down over time.  But there is no way on earth that I can paint &quot;little by little&quot; or do the sanding and patching that has to be done.  Our master bedroom is a disgusting cranberry with a white-trash special border along the top of the room that doesn&#39;t even match the<br/>\n paint.  It is intolerable.  When we moved in, the basement was Cocoa cola red, with another trashy border along the top of the entire room.  HOWEVER, (this will be one illustration of my husband&#39;s atttitude about things), we paid a painter to remove the border and paint the entire room a sort of &quot;new house beige.&quot;  And my husband bought himself an oversized l-shaped sofa with 4 recliners built in, and a 47&quot; TV with a new theater and sound system.  I hate TV in general, can&#39;t tolerate the constant &quot;noise.&quot;  I HAVE NOWHERE TO &quot;GO&quot; TO FIND MY PEACE AND SOLACE.  The living room is yellow and maroon (I kid you not) with our blue-based furniture and decor in it.  Our cranberry bedroom has all of my spa blue and orange bedroom accessories.  I was allowed to have the painters paint the kitchen - was supposed to go from seafoam green with a maroon border to plain white, BUT THE GREEN BLED THROUGH and when I brought it to the painter&#39;s attention he got<br/>\n crappy and left me a gallon of white and told my husband to do it himself.  Then there&#39;s the issue of the electric stove that my husband said we&#39;d change out for a gas one, which hasn&#39;t happened and doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s GOING to.  He keeps saying that I don&#39;t cook &quot;all that much&quot; or &quot;all that well&quot; so can&#39;t I just deal with it.  And our &quot;office room&quot; is a fleshy colored pink that is disgusting in daylight, and we are using two folding tables to supplement our broken desk that we were supposed to replace with a black desk system that I found (to match our black piano).<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is all sort of a waste of time for readers, as I complain about ridiculous details of my life.  I will make changes.  I promise you.  Your posts / suggestions are not wasted.  But I feel like without the details of what&#39;s bothering me, does it really come together?<br/>\n <br/>\nFriends?  I feel like I&#39;m just not &quot;clicking&quot; with the people I&#39;m meeting.  Maybe I expect too much?  I don&#39;t know.  But I really don&#39;t want to share my time or my kids&#39; time with parents who are proud of letting their babies just &quot;cry it out.&quot;  HOpe I don&#39;t offend anyone here.  Or I&#39;m having a hard time feeling close to people who keep telling me to wean them saying that doing that will make things soooo much eeeeasier for me.  It won&#39;t.  Or people who tell me that I&#39;m selfish for wanting to keep my kids at home while they learn.  I feel like I&#39;m not meeting people who &quot;understand me&quot; or understand that right now I&#39;m a mother FIRST, and that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I am wrong or unbalanced because I don&#39;t take my kids to the local daycare three days a week while I go to Target or enjoy &quot;me&quot; time.  I went to a get together from a meetup.com mom&#39;s group that I&#39;m in, in my town, and upon seeing all the moms ordering drinks with hard liquor<br/>\n in them, I asked whether anybody was still nursing anybody.  And one of them said &quot;oh yea, I&#39;m secretly nrsing my 3 year old.&quot;  And I belted out &quot;So am I&quot; except that she was joking.  That was her idea of a joke.  Apart from that, I think the group liked me well enough, but you see where things were headed.  I&#39;m in that online mom&#39;s group, I have attended LLL meetings (though they&#39;re about 30 minutes away into the next state - Kansas - and there were no chilren similarly aged to my big boy), and am pretty sure there is a homeschool group here in Joplin (though it is the religious-based faction).<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat gives me joy / what do we do to get out of the house?  Nothing much.  I recently started taking violin lessons again after about 20 years (I took them for 10 years when I was much younger), so that&#39;s a real treat to get out of the house not just for the 30 minute lesson, but for the fun of driving there and home without children in the car - which means I can put all the windows down, listen to whatever music I want to listen to at whatever volume I want to...  It has been somewhat difficult to make the time to practice, though once I did it while nursing my 18month old (which wasn&#39;t pretty) just so that I could continue playing instead of stopping to hold him.  It&#39;s a loud activity that I haven&#39;t been able to do while either child is sleeping/napping.  My husband initiated a weight loss contest at his office and I&#39;m &quot;unofficially&quot; participating, so I&#39;ve been working hard to &quot;do the treatmill&quot; almost everyday (we have one in our basement). <br/>\n That&#39;s not really a treat and is hard to do with the two kids repeatedly trying to get on it while I&#39;m on it, but in the larger scheme of things I do feel better after using it.  I&#39;d like to learn to knit.  Maybe get into a group that meets occasionally.<br/>\n <br/>\nBeing appreciated or appreciating my husband?  Yeah.  I don&#39;t really appreciate him, no.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am the only parent in the house.  I don&#39;t appreciate feeling like I am a housekeeper.  Or a nanny.  No, I really don&#39;t appreciate much of what he &quot;does for me.&quot;  There are two issues here, for me.  HIs parenting and his spouse-ing.  I feel like his parenting is so absolutely and completely divergent from mine, that I am so shocked, disappointed, irritated, and generally dismayed, that I find it difficult to just &quot;turn that all off&quot; (or maybe I should say &quot;turn on&quot; ) and let it all pass while we connect as spouses.  Which we don&#39;t do.  He is a hard-worker, with decent morals, motivated by the desire for approval.  He is an executive level administrator, working for the State of Missouri.  I, on the other hand, do not have a job - as he reminds me often while trying to make a joke of it to make himself seem like &quot;a big<br/>\n man.&quot;  His ideas about parenting, SCHOOLING, and directing our small children are... well, almost opposite of mine.  He makes fun of me wanting to teach our children at home - saying that I can &quot;barely manage them all day long&quot; and hand them off to him when he walks in the door, and then I want to keep them home from school?  He does not follow &quot;my&quot; procedures for running the home.  And my big boy has already keyed into the idea that there are two sets of rules / ways of doing things:  The way mom does things while dad is at work, and the way he (the child) can do things when dad is home.  And I&#39;m talking about EVERYTHING.  If I say that he needs to put his socks and shoes on to ride his bike(stating a rule of safety), he will then ask his dad whether he needs to put his socks on and my husband will say that he DOES &quot;because it&#39;s cold out&quot; (implying that if it was warm, you wouldn&#39;t have to wear them) - to which my son will say, &quot;it&#39;s NOT cold<br/>\n outside.&quot;  So, the whole issue morphs into an argument about the weather, rather than a safety rule.  I have tried to say that if he doesn&#39;t want to wear socks when it&#39;s cold out, then he will simply be cold (and I typically have extra warm/er clothes in the van.  But my husband offers &quot;bogus&quot; reasons for doing things, especially after I say something.  And lately he has started telling our son to &quot;ask Momma.&quot;  So, the responsibility falls back on me.  Like the other day I actually had a few minutes where I was able to take a bath (without having to bathe the children while I did it) and my husband actually sent my big boy into the bathroom to ask me whether he could play with a golf ball inside the house!  Well, I answered while reminding of the house rule (no heavy, hard balls inside the house - it&#39;s too much to monitor with an 18month old) and sent him out of the bathroom.  Minutes later, my husband came in and asked whether I told Xie that<br/>\n he could play with the golf ball in the house, because he lied and said that mom said it was okay.  Well, duh, why would he have to ask me that?  Does he not know/live by the same house rules that the rest of us do?  My son knows the rule, but lately has taken to testing my husband&#39;s knowledge of all of them.  And I don&#39;t care whether somebody wants to tell me that my husband is sooooo busy at work all day long that when he comes home he wants to &quot;disengage&quot; or decompress or whateve rthe excuse is.  He&#39;s not that stupid.  He&#39;s just lazy.  And he&#39;s a lazy parent because he CAN be.  meaning, because I ALWAYS take up the slack.  There is no other choice, for me at least.  So, every evening our house is chaotic, loud, and disorganized, while my kids push the limits of everything and my husband tries to squeeze in his sports games and whatever TV show he recorded.  DId I mention that I hate the tv?  And the way it divides our family.  My husband<br/>\n sits staring at the tv with his back against the couch, as if sitting on the floor is a magical way to be at the kids&#39; level, but I can hear each of them (the kids) yelling for him to look at them - he stares right over them at the TV.  Lately it&#39;s football - which seems to be on every day anymore not just monday nights.  And my son/s can be standing on the couch, jumping and walking all over it, while my husband sits there with his back against it, and I can be in the other room and I&#39;m to believe that I&#39;m the only one who can HEAR them getting crazy while he&#39;s sitting RIGHT THERE?  I won&#39;t believe that.  I&#39;m responsible for the lives of two other souls all day long and I manage to multi-task or do things in a way that I can still manage their safety.  And he cannot?  It&#39;s downright disgusting to me.  So, I end up being the one who comes into the room, states the rule (sit down on the couch, or GET down) and the kids see me as the &quot;bad guy.&quot; <br/>\n Plus, if I&#39;m in the tub, I can usually hear the savagery, which continues until someone gets hurt. ALWAYS.  And then the child who gets hurt ALWAYS walks into the bathroom crying, at which point, my private bath time is over.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and it really undermines my daily guidance of our boys when my husband uses ghetto slang with them. LIke telling them something is &quot;off the schnizzle&quot; (which my almost 4 year old repeats) or teaching him to do some vulgar movements after hitting a homerun (which he seems to expect him to do after my husband has a big hit at a softball game).  Or teaching him to sing &quot;Whoop that trick.&quot;  I mean, what are we, in junior high?  During the day, I teach them songs like &quot;Doe a Deer&quot; (From The Sound of Music) or to sing the alphabet - in other words, AGE APPROPRIATE things.  He is dumbing them down with stuff that I would be mortified if either of them ever actually parroted my husband in public.  It&#39;s not even &quot;stuff&quot; it&#39;s just stupid crap that I don&#39;t think they need to be exposed to at this tender age, like stupid little quips from the Jim Rome show (sports &quot;talkshow&quot; if you want to call it that) that my almost 4 year old repeats with enthusiasm<br/>\n after my husband &quot;uses&quot; the lines on him.  They have the rest of their lives to hear all of that and to decide whether they want to emulate it.  I don&#39;t know whether the main unschooling tenets include exposing your kids to things that are totally age inappropriate, socially inappropriate, and politically incorrect in the larger scheme of life, but I&#39;m not a fan of that sort of thing.  I can&#39;t imagine that&#39;s part of &quot;an education&quot; until the child has the skills and life experience to differentiate between desirable and undesirable language, behavior, and custom.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not a victim, that&#39;s not my point of any of this.  Rather, I CHOOSE to actively parent, to be very aware of my kids and to try to maintain some semblance of order in our house, whether it&#39;s enforcement of safety rules (like no swinging a sword at your little brother&#39;s head or stopping the swordfight until I can help them have one safetly, whereas he would just let them go at it until somebody - always the baby - gets hurt), or just plain procedures to maximize good hygiene (like accompanying Xie to the toilet where I&#39;ve seen that he needs further assistance and guidance in learning to pee standing up, because he&#39;s getting it all over himself, the floor, and his clothes - whereas my husband just yells to him from the other room whether he&#39;s &quot;okay&quot;), or somewhat regularly scheduled eating intervals (somehow on weekends he doesn&#39;t present food at least three times a day because he says he isn&#39;t hungry - hello, they&#39;re children who typically eat three<br/>\n times a day during the week, and when he doesn&#39;t offer them something to eat, the baby comes to me to nurse).  And really, despite the level of detail here, I&#39;m not so difficult to get along with that I can&#39;t make friends.  I used to have a nice network of friends when we lived in Tucson, and I made friends quickly with a family that lived across the street from the house we had in Illinois briefly, and I&#39;ve maintained some of those friendships while we&#39;ve moved back and forth across the country like gypsies.  I&#39;m just feeling like there is no substitute for having a girlfriend over, even with her kids, during the day and being able to get a few things done while she&#39;s here because she can help with my chilren or help ME.<br/>\n <br/>\nI do value your offer of virtual friendship.  And I was in tears reading your posts, touched by your warmth.  And I WILL do some of the reading you suggested.  And I won&#39;t forget to savor the &quot;good moments&quot; with my babies.  I WILL make adjustments.  I&#39;m not a lost cause.  There are just times when I feel like the weight of the world is on MY shoulders, alone, and would love to have a mother, grandmother, husband, close friend who could come over, to just &quot;fight the good fight&quot; WITH me.  Instead of feeling like a mule chained to a heavy load, wishing I was a big powerful clydesdale (spelling?) pulling on a team that would get us to where we&#39;re going so much faster that we&#39;d probably have time to run wild in the field and eat the tall grass.  And my main concern is that all of my struggles, mental, emotional, whatever, are being &quot;passed onto&quot; my boys.  The bottom line is that I want to change, better myself, make a better environment for them,<br/>\n and to lay a better framework for helping them learn the things they need to know in order to get to where they want in their lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m actually a lawyer.  I came from a family of divorce and remarriage of both parents.  My father was especially controlling, and continues to try to be.  His family is Italian, Catholic, and not formally educated (except for me and a few other same generation cousins) and maintained a strict hierarchy of governance that was headed by his mother, until her death two Augusts ago.  There were plenty of family rules, plenty of SHOULDS, and CAN&#39;Ts.  I became a lawyer to &quot;show them&quot; that I COULD.  My mother (who died in 1991) was Armenian, from a differently controlling family that stressed conformity to overarching &quot;American&quot; ways - including a husband who worked, a stay at home mother with beauty school training who could &quot;do hair&quot; in the basement for money on the side, and who took pride in cooking, cleaning, and getting the children to and from school.  My mother divorced my father, never went to beauty school, remarried a man with a couple<br/>\n kids, had my brother, and initiated our move in the 1980&#39;s from Illinois to Arizona, after which &quot;The FAmily&quot; stopped talking to her.  She was a &quot;maverick.&quot;  And so, I like to think that I got the best of both worlds from my parents.  Though I have spent considerable time (and money) in &quot;counseling&quot; trying to forge my OWN path.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd SO, here I am, trying to unschool mySELF (unsure of this context) and wanting more, or should I say LESS, for my own children... wanting them to find their own right path without forcing them down MY &quot;right path.&quot;  I&#39;m discovering that I&#39;m not entirely sure what is my right path.<br/>\n <br/>\nOkay, getting too deep for 4:30am and probably alienating members.  I&#39;ll stop.  And I&#39;m going back to bed.  For now.<br/>\nVery sincerely,<br/>\nDeborah.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118247794,"authorName":"missalexmissalex","from":"&quot;missalexmissalex&quot;

Nobody is perfect and you have a lot going on to top it off. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a five year old nursing too (like I believe Zoa said). I think four is a very trying year. There are trials with every growth period but four was particularly challenging. <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly all of my dd&#39;s friends are starting Kindergarten this year. Or most of them are. We have seen how much MORE difficult it is having them in a &quot;school&quot;. They have homework (they did in preschool too), school activities on top of things they are actually interested in, picking them up, getting them there, etc. I honestly think it is a bigger hassle from the outside looking in. I know for our family it would be a huge hassle for something we don&#39;t even believe is good for our dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my humble advice to you is to find some like minded friends (similar doesn&#39;t mean they will be exactly like you sometimes that is hard to remember). Getting involved in some sort of group might give you the friends you need and get your son involved so you feel like you are &quot;doing&quot; more. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling has been a wonderful thing for us. Radical Unschooling has opened up our lives even more. You might realize that some of those things you are going crazy about go away once you settle the real problems.

The situation is setting both of <br/>\nyou &quot;off&quot; - which may not seem helpful, but if you aren&#39;t beating <br/>\nyourself up over his behavior you might have an easier time finding <br/>\nother solutions. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that can help a whole lot in any kind of difficult <br/>\nsituation is to keep in mind that you&#39;re in a difficult situation. As <br/>\nsilly as that sounds, wanting things to just &quot;be&quot; better can be an <br/>\nenormous source of stress. Change is hard. Transitions suck. But its <br/>\nhuman nature to forget that and wonder &quot;what did I do wrong?&quot; So <br/>\nmaybe make a sign for your bathroom mirror or something as a <br/>\nreminder. Even a tiny bit less stress can make for a big shift in <br/>\ndynamics. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Big boy is also prone to &quot;fly off the handle&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It might help to know that 4yos typically crave a whole lot of <br/>\nautonomy - which means they want to be independent *and* they want <br/>\nmom to help them (but only in Exactly the way they want to be <br/>\nhelped). Making life less stressful for (and with) a 4yo involves <br/>\nfinding ways to make his life, well, easier! Look around your house <br/>\nand try to see it all from his perspective. How many things are out <br/>\nof reach? How many things are too complicated, too difficult? How <br/>\noften/loudly does he have to ask for help to get it? Can you make his <br/>\nlife easier? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Only people I know are through husband&#39;s job - nice enough <br/>\n&gt; people, but they keep suggesting that my life would be easier if <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wean my 18 month old and send the bigger boy to preschool. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yikes. Do you know anyone with a teen or pre-teen who likes little <br/>\nkids? Call local junior high and high-schools and see if they have a <br/>\nbaby-sitter &quot;club&quot; or listing, a Future Teachers club, or a Future <br/>\nHomemakers club. You may be able to get a little of the help you&#39;re <br/>\nlooking for! Tell whoever that you&#39;re not looking for a babysitter <br/>\nper se, but a &quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; - which means you can take on a <br/>\nyounger kid, as young as 10 maybe - since you&#39;re going to be right <br/>\nthere. Even someone to play with One of the kids will help you feel <br/>\nless overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If a hostile &quot;outsider&quot; <br/>\n&gt; was to observe my mothering / educating, they&#39;d think I was <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sleeping <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; late with them, feeding them too much french toast with powdered <br/>\n&gt; sugar and sharp cheddar (not at the same time) and scrambling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>around <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at the last minute to get the house barely organized (note:  not <br/>\n&gt; clean) before my husband comes home.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a word for that, y&#39;know: nesting. Doesn&#39;t that sound much <br/>\nnicer than &quot;lazing around&quot;? As crazy as this may sound, given that <br/>\nyou&#39;re feeling overwhelmed, try to shift your thinking to savoring <br/>\nthis time. Really relish the fact that you get to sleep late with <br/>\nyour sweet guys and spend the day loving them. My sweet guy is 15 - I <br/>\nmiss the little boy days, sometimes. I&#39;m glad I savored some of them. <br/>\nI did better savoring the little-girl days with my 7yo, and have been <br/>\nglad of that - a year ago my partner had an injury and I went to work <br/>\nft as a result, so days of sleeping in and eating french toast and <br/>\ncheese are confined to weekends and holidays for me. Any time you <br/>\nthink of it, savor the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that helps for those not-so-savory moments is to see them <br/>\nas individual instances, rather than stringing all of them together <br/>\ninto &quot;a bad day&quot; or words &quot;a bad kid&quot; - which isn&#39;t what you said, <br/>\nbut you did say a lot about negative behavior.

That helps life in general Be <br/>\nbetter, by reducing stress all &#39;round. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a place to start, anyway. Beyond that, would you like to lay <br/>\nout some specific incidents and look for possible ways to do <br/>\ndifferently next time?

With the 3rd, I&#39;ve had more stresses and<br/>\neven more than normal haven&#39;t been the mom I want to be.  Giving us both the<br/>\ngift of nursing has been so great and healing.  And in my case, he is likely<br/>\nmy last so I cherish every moment.

So many well-meaning people suggest weaning as a<br/>\nstress relief.  Intuitively, I knew that weaning my children before they<br/>\nwere ready would be painful on some level for both of us which would negate<br/>\nany stress benefit.  Of course YMMV, but I know that sometimes being in the<br/>\nnow, it is hard to evaluate the impact on the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nVirtual hugs,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie in NY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224031522,"authorName":"Zoa Conner","from":"Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt;","profile":"zoaconner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] On the verge of signing up for Early Childhood Program","postDate":"1225625882","msgId":36920,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM1MzJGQjRBLjExRDhBJXpvYWNvbm5lckBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlZ3ZkYytpcXEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36917,"nextInTopic":36926,"prevInTime":36919,"nextInTime":36921,"topicId":36906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Deborah, It sounds like you have already identified the basic problem.

I am having to take a look at myself and <br/>\nrealize that the children are behaving the way they do because of the <br/>\nway I have behaved for all of their lives (mine are 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, <br/>\nand 14...although the 12yo and one 14yo are my step-sons).  It is <br/>\nvery hard to undo what &quot;has been&quot; for so long, but I KNOW it&#39;s <br/>\npossible.  Your boys are so very young and it will honestly be SO <br/>\nworth it for you to make the changes you need to make in order to <br/>\nbring them up in a happy home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of it is going to be changing the way you think about <br/>\nthings.  I am trying to do lots of reading and I have heard great <br/>\nthings about Rue Kream&#39;s book (although now I can&#39;t remember what <br/>\nit&#39;s called).  You also need to be patient with yourself!  If you <br/>\nmess up, acknowledge it and let it go...try to think of it as a <br/>\nstepping stone on your journey to being the mom you want to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to focus on simply making sure my kids are treated in a <br/>\nway that shows them that they are loved, respected, and considered <br/>\nincredibly important.  My kids have not always felt safe voicing <br/>\ntheir thoughts or opinions or needs.  They are still learning to <br/>\ntrust that I really do care about their needs, thoughts, desires, and <br/>\nfeelings.  When they act in a way that makes me want to return to my <br/>\nold ways of parenting (sending them to their room, griping at them, <br/>\nnagging) I attempt to take a deep breath and remember that they are <br/>\ndoing the best the can in the situation.  I try to make sure I don&#39;t <br/>\ntake anything personally and I make sure that they know that no <br/>\nmatter what they say or do...I will love them and do whatever I can <br/>\nto meet their needs with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am NOT perfect and I make mistakes all the time, but I am learning <br/>\nto let the mistakes be a learning situation rather than a stumbling <br/>\nblock.  I don&#39;t beat myself up!  I acknowledge what I&#39;ve done wrong, <br/>\napologize genuinely (if needed), and I pack it away in my brain as a <br/>\nlearning experience that is taking me closer to the mom I am becoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once married to a man that made me feel less than whole and <br/>\nmade me feel incredibly taken advantage of and drained of all hope.  <br/>\nI think the best thing to do is make sure he understands how you&#39;re <br/>\nfeeling.  It&#39;s also really crucial that you are willing to listen to <br/>\nhim and his needs.  Just like with the kids, try to not let the <br/>\nthings he does or says hurt you in such a personal way (much easier <br/>\nsaid than done).  Try to remember that he really is doing the best he <br/>\ncan with what he knows how to do...and love him through his &quot;ugly <br/>\nbehavior&quot; too.  I also have to remind myself that it is not my job to <br/>\nchange someone else...but it is my job to surround myself with those <br/>\nthat treat me in a way that I deserve to be treated.  Along with that-<br/>\n-the people I surround myself with also deserve to be treated in a <br/>\nloving, caring, respectful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO, my best suggestion is to read!

My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1088508127\">I&#39;m writing to ask for some... for a mental &quot;boost,&quot; support, <br/>\nguidance, direction, whatever.  I am a stay-at-home-with-my-babies <br/>\nmother to two lovely boys.  My &quot;big boy&quot; will be 4 years old in a <br/>\nmonth and my &quot;baby&quot; will be 18 months old on the same day.  I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m doing NOTHING positive for either of them and am <br/>\nconsidering signing up my big boy for the Early Childhood Program at <br/>\nthe University in our (tiny) town.  Mostly because I am afraid that <br/>\nthe only behavior he&#39;s seeing is my overwhelmed-momma ranting.  <br/>\nSeems to me he is extremely NASTY, and because he sees ME being <br/>\nnasty as I&quot;m feeling isolated (moved here this past Jan and have no <br/>\nreal &quot;friends&quot;), overwhelmed (bigger house means bigger mess), <br/>\nunappreciated (by my husband for a variety of reasons), and unable <br/>\nto divide my time and attention properly between two darling <br/>\nchildren.  Big boy is also prone to &quot;fly off the handle&quot; (gee, <br/>\nwonder where he saw that?), yelling (so I look in the mirror), and <br/>\nbargaining with &quot;us&quot; parents (my husband is responsible for that <br/>\none).  I feel unable to change without SOMEBODY to come over and... <br/>\nnot &quot;watch&quot; me, but to just HELP me a little, or to do some hand-<br/>\nholding.  Only people I know are through husband&#39;s job - nice enough <br/>\npeople, but they keep suggesting that my life would be easier if I&#39;d <br/>\nwean my 18 month old and send the bigger boy to preschool.  I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t mentioned that the big boy still occasionally nurses <br/>\nfor &quot;love&quot; as he says.  Any of you live near Joplin, Missouri?  I <br/>\nwish I could get him into a little &quot;program&quot; maybe a couple hours, <br/>\ntwice a week...  But I&#39;m kinda like the person screaming that <br/>\nthey&#39;re going to jump from the ledge and never does, when it comes <br/>\nto &quot;sending him&quot; or &quot;leaving him&quot; anywhere.  We just recently &quot;left <br/>\nhim&quot; with somebody for the first time in those 4 years earlier this <br/>\nmonth on our wedding anniversary - and ended up driving to the store <br/>\nand home.  I just can&#39;t completely digest the idea of having a set <br/>\nschedule for &quot;dropping&quot; him off somewhere.  And I have TONS of <br/>\nsupplies to play with for learning at home, I just feel so... <br/>\noverwhelmed is the only word I can give.  If a hostile &quot;outsider&quot; <br/>\nwas to observe my mothering / educating, they&#39;d think I was sleeping <br/>\nlate with them, feeding them too much french toast with powdered <br/>\nsugar and sharp cheddar (not at the same time) and scrambling around <br/>\nat the last minute to get the house barely organized (note:  not <br/>\nclean) before my husband comes home.  Yeah, okay.  Sure, I guess.  <br/>\nAnd up until now, it&#39;s been FABULOUSLY successful in as much as both <br/>\nof my boys are borderline geniuses.  (I&#39;m showing off a little.)  My <br/>\n4 year-old (can I just call him that?) has a fantastic vocabulary, <br/>\noutrageously keen problem-solving skills, amazing empathy, and a <br/>\nflair for the dramatic.  BUT... he&#39;s also beginnig to &quot;do&quot; EVERY <br/>\nSINGLE ONE OF MY NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS.  Squared.  Okay, I&#39;m tired and <br/>\nI&quot;m rambling a little.  My 18 month old doesn&#39;t sleep longer than 1 <br/>\nhour and 40 minutes.  I haven&#39;t slept properly in about 4 years.  I <br/>\nWANT to live what I think - what I only BARELY understand - is, <br/>\nmight be, the unschooling lifestyle.  But I&#39;m struggling.  You each <br/>\nhad to &quot;start&quot; somewhere.
