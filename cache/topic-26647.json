My first dd weaned herself but I needed to help out my ds.<br/>\nHe was still nursing at 4 and some odd months when I got pregnant again. I<br/>\nhad just assumed either he&#39;d wean while I was pregnant or we&#39;d tandem nurse.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize how painful it would be for me! So I had to talk to him<br/>\nabout it after &quot;grinning and baring it&quot; for a couple weeks. I talk to him<br/>\nabout how I loved to nurse him and I knew that he loved &quot;boobie&quot; but that it<br/>\nwas physically hurting me and I felt like I couldn&#39;t do it anymore (at all,<br/>\nnot necessarily what your needs are). So we came up with a solution for<br/>\nweaning. I would try and nurse him when he asked but if it hurt then he&#39;d<br/>\nstop and we&#39;d try something else. He decided that back-rubs and cuddling<br/>\nwould work for him. So that is how we did it. It really didn&#39;t take long to<br/>\nacclimate to the substitute. Also, he wanted to be reassured that I would<br/>\nnurse him when the baby came. Well, he tried it, but had no idea how to<br/>\nlatch anymore. It had only been a couple months! But like you I had found<br/>\nhis latch becoming uncomfortable before I even got pregnant and had been<br/>\ndiscussing weaning but not active prior to that. He was very lax about<br/>\npositioning and it wasn&#39;t always comfortable. I would just ask him to<br/>\nre-latch or stop if he couldn&#39;t get on the boob in a way that was mutually<br/>\ncomfortable.I admire persitant in nursing in our society, it is so<br/>\nunsupported.

We also believe in child-led weaning.  I don&#39;t really have any tips for gently weaning but I do have some tips I have found for my sanity:). <br/>\nMost of the time, she knows that she can have &quot;nummies&quot; whenever. However, there are times when I am in a hurry that we have come up with &quot;hurry up nummies&quot;. It works great. Sometimes she asks me to count, sometimes she counts in her head or mumbles (quite cute), or sometimes it is just an approximate amount of time. Usually she HAS to have both sides but not always. <br/>\nThis has worked great for us in times that I truely am hurried and she truely needs me.<br/>\nThe other thing that you might want to think about is this. When I feel like dd is ALWAYS nursing, it is usually a few things that might be happening<br/>\n1) I am getting sick and amazingly she knows this and instinctively nurses a TON.<br/>\n2) I am more rushed than usually and she is telling me to slow down and spend some time with her.<br/>\n3)She is feeling sick, tired, rushed, sad, etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that could be happening for you (this is just a guess since I have an only child so far), is your daughter nursing more (maybe for one of the above reasons) and therefore your son wants to nurse more too? Or is he feeling neglected for some reason (I know 2 yr olds can take a lot of energy so maybe more time is going to your daughter right now?).<br/>\nThese are just all ideas. You son might just nurse a lot too. I know my daughter nurses a lot more than I thought she would. <br/>\nI would also like to say congrats on not only extended bfing, but also tandem nursing. I know I like to hear it and feel like usually I hear the opposite! :) As stressful as I know it can feel, the time is passing quickly. Can you believe your son is 5? It feels like my dd was just turning 1! She is now a little past 4. It flies by.<br/>\nAlso I can&#39;t remember if I introduced myself, but my name is Jessica. I am loving this list and all of the conversations on it. Our dd is 4 (obviously) and we kind of lead ourselves to unschooling through child-led weaning actually. It just made sense. We are loving the unschooling life we have picked. It is amazing how awesome are kids are when we just let them blossom:).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I answered your question Karen, but if you want to talk more you can e-mail me. <br/>\n<br/>\nJessica (off to bed because I just realized what time it is!)<br/>\n<br/>\nVisit my website at www.mytupperware.com/jessicamcchesney <br/>\nThere are all sorts of specials for the holidays.

Julian is 5, Julia  is <br/>\n2, they both want to nurse ALL the time (ok, it feels that way, lol) and I&#39;m  <br/>\nfeeling overwhelmed by it all. I really want to do child-lead weaning. But I  <br/>\nwant their time to be NOW, lol...well, Julian, mainly. Nursing him sometimes  <br/>\nhurts, the latch is awkward I think at this age, he has ALWAYS been an other  <br/>\nside twiddler which I&#39;ve ALWAYS gently redirected but he still does it (it&#39;s <br/>\nnot  always conscious, but sometimes it is for him). I don&#39;t know...I need a <br/>\nfew  things I think:<br/>\n <br/>\n1. Please help support my decision to allow child lead weaning! I need the  <br/>\nsupport to help continue what I know feels right for us. <br/>\n <br/>\n2. Ideas of GENTLE weaning approaches - the kind that are more of a gentle  <br/>\nredirection-see-what-happens-go-from-there kinda thing. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s making me crazy at times. And at times, I&#39;m grateful we are continuing  <br/>\non this path. But this fits into RU so well, and I just know that someone here <br/>\n will be able to help...<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks! <br/>\nKaren<br/>\nJulian 5, Julia, 2 <br/>\n(and Laura 19, James 18, Grace 15!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26935,"nextTopicId":26920}}
