As  <br/>\nan example, I think many of the posts about brushing not being the be  <br/>\nall and end all of cavity prevention come across as though the poster  <br/>\nwere saying &quot;Brushing isn&#39;t important. If they brush, fine, if they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t brush, fine too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what people are trying to do is help people approach a problem  <br/>\ncalmly and rationally without the fear driving them. There are many  <br/>\nsolutions to the issues kids have with brushing. (Brushing together,  <br/>\nusing just water, different toothpastes, and so on and so on.) But  <br/>\nit&#39;s much easier to see new solutions and try ones suggested if  <br/>\nparents do it from a position of knowledge rather than fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids *will* be more prone to cavities but that&#39;s not a reason to  <br/>\ntreat all kids as though that were true. Some kids may never get  <br/>\ncavities regardless of their brushing frequency but that&#39;s not a  <br/>\nreason to treat all kids as though that were true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we give them *real* information it will help them make better more  <br/>\ninformed decisions. Real information is &quot;Brushing will help most  <br/>\npeople prevent cavities.&quot; If we treat their objections seriously and  <br/>\nwith real respect, they will come to understand that we&#39;re trying to  <br/>\nhelp them. And we can better do that when we don&#39;t fear that a day or  <br/>\na week or even a month without brushing means their teeth will rot.  <br/>\nWe can help them better if we aren&#39;t hovering over them impatiently  <br/>\nwaiting for them to show they&#39;ve made the &quot;right&quot; decision by  <br/>\nbrushing their teeth everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":214857126,"authorName":"kristenhendricks55","from":"&quot;kristenhendricks55&quot; &lt;kristenhendricks55@...&gt;","profile":"kristenhendricks55","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: candy, teeth, and brushing","postDate":"1168321161","msgId":20540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVudjlxOStkZnBhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwYjYwMWM3MzNhZiQxMDVhNWY4MCRmYzY4OTA0NUBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":20533,"nextInTopic":20550,"prevInTime":20539,"nextInTime":20541,"topicId":20429,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OOOOOHHHH!!!

Now, I know that kids&#39; mouths are different than adults<br/>\nbut ?I can&#39;t imagine that the bacteria doesn&#39;t eventually grow to<br/>\ndangerous levels. I know that if my son doesn&#39;t brush his tongue every<br/>\ncouple of days, it looks disgusting and his breath just stinks!! Kids<br/>\n(like many adults) may not understand or care about the consequences<br/>\nbut the are very real - danger of rotting teeth, full body infection<br/>\n(this is more common than most people realize), and people not wanting<br/>\nto be around you. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, in terms of teeth and decay, obviously it&#39;s more than<br/>\njust sugar that does it. But sugar is a big factor. It readily sticks<br/>\nto the gums and teeth and is a perfect food to help the bacteria grow.<br/>\nBut chewing sugarless gum can help get rid of a lot of the sugar - it<br/>\nincreases the saliva production and helps to break down the sugars,<br/>\nwhich you just swallow with your saliva. A lot of dentists now<br/>\nrecommend this to parents for many kids who have had bad luck with<br/>\ncavities at a young age and it&#39;s not just for candy and chocolate -<br/>\nbut for anything with high sugar content, including fruits. Swishing<br/>\nwater in the mouth helps as well. Sometime this is better because the<br/>\nwater can go through the spaces between teeth. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not the greatest with teeth brushing (well, I am because I have<br/>\nhealth problems and can&#39;t afford any addition possibility of infection<br/>\nthrough my mouth) . As long as the kids brush at least once a day, I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy. They usually choose night time, but sometimes they will<br/>\nremember to brush in the morning too. And sometimes if they&#39;re really<br/>\ntired they won&#39;t brush at night. But I also buy mouth washes that they<br/>\nlike to use (both the flouride ones and the staining ones). IT<br/>\nmotivates them to brush and I&#39;m assuming (though maybe wrongly so)<br/>\nthat the alcohol in it must kill at least some of the germs in the mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20637,"nextTopicId":20595}}
