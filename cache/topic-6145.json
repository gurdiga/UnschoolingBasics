They&#39;re pay-as-you-go, so the per-minute chrage is  <br/>\nhigher, but it&#39;s cheaper for what I need. They have a good deal: $19.99 for a  <br/>\nbasic phone and 40 minute card of time. If you let me refer you, you get an  <br/>\nextra 100 minutes, and I get 100 too. (You don&#39;t have to let me refer you. I&#39;ll  <br/>\nlove you anyway.)  The site is _http://tracfone.com_ (http://tracfone.com)  <br/>\n <br/>\nTo keep the phone active you have to buy a new card every 60-365 days,  <br/>\ndepending on the denomination of the card. For example, the 40 minute card this  <br/>\nthing came with gives me 2 months time. So, with a phone, that&#39;s less than $10 a <br/>\n month. No activation fees, and if you activate your cards online (you can <br/>\nalso  buy the cards in stores, or activate by phone) they add extra minutes.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway....the phones are not sexy, and if you talk a lot on them, you&#39;re  <br/>\nprobably better off with a regular plan. But to send with the kids if they&#39;re  <br/>\naway or at friends, or for emergencies, they seem practical.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re open to me referring you, send me an e-mail at _KathrynJB@..._ <br/>\n(mailto:KathrynJB@...)  and they&#39;ll send you an  e-mail link. <br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6138,"nextTopicId":6146}}
