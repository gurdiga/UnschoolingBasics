I looked at him and said, &quot;What do you need?&quot;  He said,<br/>\n&quot;More love from you.&quot;  So we hugged some more.

When I joined these lists and read what the posters wrote <br/>\nabout how to deal with these &quot;tantrums,&quot; it made all the sense in the <br/>\nworld---just like my dad&#39;s statement.

It&#39;s ok for him to be upset that he <br/>\ncan&#39;t have everything he wants right this moment. He truly does not <br/>\nunderstand why not.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEmpathizing with your son may help. I talk to my ds about how hard <br/>\nit is to wait for things we really want and how much it really <br/>\nstinks to not be able to get everything we want right now. I tell <br/>\nhim about things that I want that I can&#39;t afford right now (and <br/>\nprobably never will be able to). That won&#39;t necessarily make him <br/>\nstop crying and screaming but I hope it lets him know that we all <br/>\nfeel that way and it&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n=======<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am livinf with a tyrant who will not<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; accept a no.

I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad to change my thinking and tell myself, if anyone is thinking <br/>\nanything about us, they are probably thinking that they know how it <br/>\nis (even if that may not be true it makes me feel better).<br/>\n<br/>\n=======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am not sure if having anxiety<br/>\n&gt; is incompatible with RU. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>========<br/>\n<br/>\nAnxiety is normal. Any feeling is normal. It&#39;s what you do with <br/>\nthose feelings that makes the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n========<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso we got large play balls. The kids kept<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; bouncing them and stuff.

I can <br/>\nsee how it might be dangerous. A ball could hit a person, even a <br/>\nsmall child, who could get hurt or it could hit some other things in <br/>\nthe store and break them. Maybe your ds would&#39;ve responded better to <br/>\nthat reasoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n=======<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also sent him to his room because I needed space from his almost<br/>\n&gt; constant verbal abuse today. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=========<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s prefectly ok for you to take a time out if you are <br/>\nfeeling very angry, upset, overwhelmed. There are ways to do it <br/>\nwithout it being a punishment for your child. Sometimes I tell my ds <br/>\nthat I&#39;m feeling very whatever and need a moment to myself and would <br/>\nlike to go in my room alone for a little bit. I couldn&#39;t do that <br/>\nwhen he was 3 but now that he&#39;s 4 he&#39;s getting better with this <br/>\nconcept.<br/>\n<br/>\n=========== <br/>\n<br/>\nHe just woke up in a crappy mood and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; takes it out on me and whoever is around.This is frequent.

Let him get out all his <br/>\nangry feelings in a safe place with you just there not passing <br/>\njudgement, not reacting at all. Let him lead. Hold him if he wants <br/>\nto be held.

But I think we had a break through today at<br/>\nthe grocery store.  He wanted to get a magazine (which I let him have).  But<br/>\nat the checkout, he changed his mind and asked for a Rockies baseball<br/>\ntoy--many of which were on display at the end of the checkout counter.  I<br/>\ntold him that it depended on which one.  (Some were more expensive than<br/>\nothers.)  He couldn&#39;t decide and it ended up that I was finished checking<br/>\nout before he could decide, so we left without one.  Of course he threw a<br/>\nfit.  But I&#39;ve been trying to be more understanding, and I could definitely<br/>\nsee his point of view on this, so I think that helped me stay calm.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally I would have forced him into the car or a quiet corner of the store<br/>\nwhere we could talk, and no one would be staring at us.  But I felt more<br/>\nconfident this time, for some reason, and didn&#39;t care who was staring.  We<br/>\ncalmly talked (with several not so calm shouts from him) about why he<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t have the toy.  He didn&#39;t care, but I was willing to stay and<br/>\ncontinue talking as long as it took.  I tried to stay very calm and loving.<br/>\nThen he started pulling all the toys off the rack and throwing them on the<br/>\nfloor.  I did physically have to stop him on this, and I carried him into<br/>\nthe cart.  I told him those weren&#39;t our toys, and I couldn&#39;t let him be<br/>\ndisrespectful.  In the past this kind of behavior has escalated into full on<br/>\nyelling and screaming and kicking on his part, especially if I have to<br/>\nphysically control him.  But he seemed okay with me putting him in the<br/>\ncart.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut in the parking lot, he refused to get out of the cart and into the car.<br/>\nHe started crying about how his life sucked and nothing ever goes right.<br/>\n(His usual response in situations like these.  But normally it goes on for<br/>\nat least a half hour.)  Instead of brushing that off or even trying to<br/>\nrespond to the comment, I just reached over and gave him a hug.  And he let<br/>\nme hug him.  Then I tried one more time to get him out of the cart, but he<br/>\nstill resisted.  I looked at him and said, &quot;What do you need?&quot;  He said,<br/>\n&quot;More love from you.&quot;  So we hugged some more.

(Getting there) and I only recently<br/>\n(maybe a week or two ago) started fixing the damage I feel I have done<br/>\nduring the course of this pregnancy.  I ended up getting one night<br/>\naway with my husband (anniversary) and (instead of enjoying his<br/>\ncompany - sorry) I did nothing but think about how I and we could fix<br/>\nwhat was happening.  It was just eating at me.  We were experiencing a<br/>\nlot of the same things you described, only mine is 9!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did, was really look deep to see how I had changed when I got<br/>\npregnant.  I had become something of a hormonal mess.  Or so i felt<br/>\nlike one anyway.  I was snappy and rude, short tempered, tired a lot<br/>\nmore, emotionally unavailable, and less sensitive to their needs.  It<br/>\nwas really hard to make the change, but i had to stop thinking about<br/>\nme and really focus on THEM.  I still feel that being pregnant takes<br/>\nso much out of their precious lives, but I suppose its a learning<br/>\nexperience for all of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sort of used the &quot;kill em with kindness&quot; thing.  I just practiced<br/>\nbeing as patient and as kind as humanly possible.  Until it became<br/>\nnatural again.  I made some special days for the older child (who seem<br/>\nto be suffering more).  We&#39;re painting his room, and I&#39;m really<br/>\nfocussing on paying more attention to him and his needs.  We brought<br/>\nsome more toys into the common area and I am playing with him more.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...  in a nutshell.  In order to figure out why my kids were<br/>\nsuddenly acting like they were before unschooling, I had to look at my<br/>\nown behavior and fix it.

It is with applying it.<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you&#39;re already halfway there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifics? Maybe we can help.<br/>\n<br/>\n========<br/>\nIt is so in my face right now...<br/>\nI would like to live consensually with my kids. I have been trying to<br/>\ntalk with then and come to agreeable solutions. Sometimes they (ok<br/>\nmostly the 5y/o) will refuse to talk or even listen. I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nto do. I learned to parent from Dr. Sears books. 2 years ago I learned<br/>\nabout radical unschooling and the philosophy lit up my heart. This is<br/>\nthe way my partner and I wanted to parent. So we are struggling to<br/>\ngive up our coercive ways and be more in partnership with our kids.<br/>\nW.e worked through US&#39;ing television, food, etc. I am still struggling<br/>\nwith chores, we don&#39;t have any for the kids but I still get bent about<br/>\nit occaisionally. My biggest road block is safety and disrespect. I do<br/>\nsometimes resort to punishment when I can&#39;t figure things out. But<br/>\nbecause I know there is a kinder way I feel horrible doing that.<br/>\nexample:<br/>\nToday at Target we went to buy outdoor toys. I am the house in town<br/>\nthat all the kids congregate so we needed to get more supplies like<br/>\nchalk, bubbles, etc. We made a list. When we get there they keep<br/>\nasking me for stuff. I explain the limited funds. Remind that that<br/>\nnext weekend we will be going away, etc. Still my ds5 pitches a few<br/>\nfits. I work through them, his sister even works thru one with him. He<br/>\nscreams that he does care about xyz he wants what he wants and he<br/>\nwants it now! I feel like I am livinf with a tyrant who will not<br/>\naccept a no. I feel really frustrated. I can&#39;t handle these frequent<br/>\nmelt downs emotionally. I get anxiety, I am not sure if having anxiety<br/>\nis incompatible with RU. Also we got large play balls. The kids kept<br/>\nbouncing them and stuff. But the store was not crowded but had a few<br/>\npeople. I asked them to put them in the car or hold on to them. I<br/>\nexplained that there were too many people to bounce balls and that it<br/>\nwould be disrespectful to do so.  ds5 kept doig it. I know he just<br/>\nforgot but when I reminded him he got really verbally abusive. I did<br/>\nafter severaln reminders tell him that if the ball left his hands<br/>\nagain i would put it away. I felt like that was a threat of punishment<br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also sent him to his room because I needed space from his almost<br/>\nconstant verbal abuse today. He just woke up in a crappy mood and<br/>\ntakes it out on me and whoever is around.This is frequent. Nothing<br/>\nhelps him to feel better. ok, at least nothing I have been able to<br/>\nfigure out. He is so full of anger and wants to hurt people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33530,"nextTopicId":33377}}
