Even now that we&#39;re deschooled, they still ask for a lot of things. They don&#39;t <br/>\nask as a means of obtaining permission, but it is a way to check in with me. It is also <br/>\nimportant because we&#39;ve had many experiences with someone eating all of the eggs, and <br/>\nnot having enough to make cookies, or them getting involved with a messy project and <br/>\nthen needing to quit in the middle to make another engagement that they&#39;ve been looking <br/>\nforward. So we&#39;ll say, &quot;Yes, you can have eggs but please leave two for a cookie batch.&quot; It&#39;s <br/>\njust common courtesy  in a family! So now my older children don&#39;t ask &#39;Can I&#39; but ask &#39;is <br/>\nthere a plan for this?&#39;<br/>\nAs someone else mentioned, be thankful that they are wanting to connect to you, smile, <br/>\nand gracefully say &quot;Yes!
