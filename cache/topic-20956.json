This is correct. Any essential oil can cause  <br/>\nsensitization if used undiluted. It may not happen the first time, or  <br/>\nthe tenth time, or the 100th time, but there is always the  <br/>\npossibility of sensitization occurring at some point. Once you become  <br/>\nsensitized, you probably will not be able to use that oil (and  <br/>\npossibly any other oil with a similar chemical structure) ever again.  <br/>\nSome essential oils, if used undiluted, can cause burns and scarring  <br/>\nas well. All essential oils can be toxic if used undiluted, in large  <br/>\nenough amounts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to &quot;The Aromatherapy Practitioner Reference Manual&quot; (one of  <br/>\nthe most highly respected reference books in the field) tea tree has  <br/>\nbeen &quot;tested at low dose non-toxic, possible skin irritant, not  <br/>\ntested for sensitization at levels higher than 1% dilution.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCommon dilutions for use with most essential oils is 1% for babies/ <br/>\nchildren and 2.5% for adults. Pregnancy is always an area of concern  <br/>\nfor topical application only because women commonly experience more  <br/>\nsensitivity and skin changes during pregnancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t mean to discourage anyone from using essential oils  <br/>\n- they can be a wonderful, natural way to treat common illnesses/ <br/>\ninjuries and enhance health and wellness.
