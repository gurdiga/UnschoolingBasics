I lay down with him at night and I rad to him for a while.  Then we talk a bit more.  Finally I tell him I am tired and we need to go to sleep.  He asked me tonight why I have less energy then he does.  He said I am an energetic boy.  I aid yes, you are (and actually felt proud of the fact even though  tired).  He asked me why I had less energy then he does and even though he knows I have MS I decided that we didn&#39;t need to talk about hat again right before nodding off.  So I just said well honey, sometimes grown ups just get tired before kids do.  He thought that was funny.  I know many nights after he has fallen asleep before I crawl out of his bed I lay there for a while just basking in the joy of having such a sweet kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are thinking about allowing him to stay up without having to go to sleep when we decide (so we can have an hour to talk alone in our bedroom).   <br/>\n<br/>\nOn school breaks I tried to keep him busy but I can see how that is not working so well for him now as I have rad others postings.  I think he needs less scheduled activities and some more &quot;down&quot; time :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 14, 2005 5:32 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [Norton AntiSpam] Re: [unschoolingbasics] Throwing things around<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;My five year old throws things around when he is angry.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Could you surround him with lots of soft toys and objects for awhile so he can throw and not hurt anyone or anything?
