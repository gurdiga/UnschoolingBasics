In some ways it&#39;s hard to talk about such a thing as an  <br/>\nunschooler (we don&#39;t WANT him to be &quot;done!&quot;), but there&#39;s also a lot of value in  <br/>\nritual and celebration. Julian is a musician planning to be a professional  <br/>\nmusician, so we chose to have him perform a concert for family and friends,  <br/>\nfollowed by a party.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was so amazing. He had a bunch of his best friends attend or participate  <br/>\nin the performance, and he did a great job. We had about 85 people, I think,  <br/>\nwith great music followed by partying. It was really nice. And his retired  <br/>\nschoolteacher grandmother actually behaved!!!!!!!  The concert ended with a  <br/>\nparticipatory version of Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;The Wall&quot; --- &quot;We don&#39;t need no  <br/>\neducation!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe had a passel of teenagers here for a nice long visit, and it was loud  and <br/>\ngiggly and fun. <br/>\n <br/>\nThis weekend we went to Vermont to visit Goddard College, which Julian will  <br/>\nattend in the fall. I am a graduate of Hampshire College, another progressive, <br/>\n alt-y place, but I think Goddard may be the most wonderful choice for <br/>\ndedicated  unschoolers. In the individualized BA program, each learner develops <br/>\ntheir own  plan during an 8 day per semester residency, then goes back into the <br/>\ncommunity  to learn. The campus itself is lovely, in rural Vermont. And they <br/>\nreally respect  unschoolers. (Goddard actually sent a rep to the last unschooling <br/>\nconference in  Peabody, MA)<br/>\n <br/>\nVery cool couple of weeks.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24066,"nextTopicId":23906}}
