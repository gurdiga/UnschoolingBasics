I love to learn new things right<br/>\nalong with the children. I don&#39;t have any old spoons,<br/>\nbut should be able to find one when we go to garage<br/>\nsales.  I am definately going to share this with my<br/>\nkids.  It makes for a fun experiment.  Any other ideas<br/>\nyou can share will be awesome.  We are always looking<br/>\nfor new and exciting ideas.  We will be taking a trip<br/>\nto Disney in February.  This is going to be fun. <br/>\nAlso, thanks for the explanation.  I will also share<br/>\nthat with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave an awesome weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n----Vanessa<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Michelle Leifur Reid &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamperedmichelle@...\">pamperedmichelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On 9/14/06, Vanessa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:psychomom95@...\">psychomom95@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Last week we tried experimenting on different<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things that might take the tarnish off from<br/>\n&gt; pennies-(something my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; son asked me if I knew how to do it/what would<br/>\n&gt; take it off).  We<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brainstormed, and tried baking soda and water,<br/>\n&gt; peroxide, and even my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; dad had told me he heard that coke will disolve a<br/>\n&gt; penny, so we tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that too. None of that worked. I was talking to a<br/>\n&gt; friend of mine,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and she said taco sauce would do it.  So we tried<br/>\n&gt; soaking the penny<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in taco sauce for like 15 minutes, and it worked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just baking soda won&#39;t work, but baking soda and<br/>\n&gt; vinegar will (watch out it<br/>\n&gt; will erupt everywhere - add bits at a time)  Also<br/>\n&gt; vinegar will do a fairly<br/>\n&gt; good job on its own.  Catsup is also a good way to<br/>\n&gt; shine a penny.  Now if<br/>\n&gt; you want to try something fun, make up some vinegar<br/>\n&gt; and soda water and take<br/>\n&gt; an old spoon you don&#39;t care about anymore (go to the<br/>\n&gt; thrift store and buy<br/>\n&gt; one for a quarter).  Put a post-1982 penny in a<br/>\n&gt; glass (don&#39;t use plastic or<br/>\n&gt; metal) bowl or cup.  Put in the baking soda and<br/>\n&gt; vinegar and then put the<br/>\n&gt; spoon in the cup with the penny, resting the spoon<br/>\n&gt; on the penny.  Leave it<br/>\n&gt; over night.  Then come back and see what happens. <br/>\n&gt; Also, if you are wanting<br/>\n&gt; to shine pennies for pressed penny machines, use<br/>\n&gt; pre-1982 as they don&#39;t have<br/>\n&gt; zinc in them and press prettier.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; SPOILER AHEAD - if you don&#39;t want to know what<br/>\n&gt; happens quit reading now,<br/>\n&gt; otherwise scroll down<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; 8<br/>\n&gt; OK, if you want to know what happens.  A chemical<br/>\n&gt; reaction takes place<br/>\n&gt; between the vinegar, baking soda and metal from the<br/>\n&gt; spoon.  The penny should<br/>\n&gt; have an corroded place where the spoon was resting<br/>\n&gt; on the penny *and* the<br/>\n&gt; spoon may be coated (depending on what kind of metal<br/>\n&gt; spoon you use - don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; use silver or silverplate) with a brown film. <br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s copper.  It works best<br/>\n&gt; with a post-1982 penny as there is more zinc in the<br/>\n&gt; pennies and this boosts<br/>\n&gt; the reaction.
