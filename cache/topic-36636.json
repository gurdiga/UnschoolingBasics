We <br/>\nlive in Southern Oregon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter has asked me to put the word out for her.  She is <br/>\nlooking for online friends.  People to hang out with on Club Penguin <br/>\nand Toontown or any other safe place that might be suggested.  If <br/>\nanyone has kids who would be interested in exchanging email addys <br/>\nwith her that would be great.  I am really hoping to attend the Life <br/>\nis Good conference next spring so it would be fabulous if she could <br/>\nmaybe build some online friendships with people she might actually <br/>\nget to meet.  She doesn&#39;t have IM at this time but I&#39;d be happy to <br/>\nhelp her set something up when the need arises.  Any other <br/>\nsuggestions anyone has as to how to help her get what she is looking <br/>\nfor (online friends that she can actually chat with without all the <br/>\nrestrictions club penguin and the like have due to safety) would be <br/>\ngreatly appreciated.  We are open to all ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if there are any hidden Southern Oregonians out there speak <br/>\nup.   We have had a very hard time finding any other un schoolers <br/>\nhere to hang out with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to mail me offlist and thanks in advance for any help <br/>\nanyone can give.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Lynda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPS...I was having trouble posting this so if other unfinished posts <br/>\ncame through, my apologies</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36613,"nextTopicId":36615}}
