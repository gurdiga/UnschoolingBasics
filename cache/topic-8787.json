I really wish my mom had let me do just that. There are games that are<br/>\nat the base nothing more then a story but you still learn something. Mine<br/>\nwas Willow for the original Nitendo. It was a role playing game and you had<br/>\nto build up your character, follow directions, find new equipment, make good<br/>\nchoice. Now there are games that are like that but better - PS2 and Xbox has<br/>\na jedi game that you can play over and over and each time it is different<br/>\ndepending of the life choice you make, there are ocean exploration games and<br/>\noftern getting the cheat books make good text books because there are maps<br/>\nto follow and helpful hints and interactions that some would not think of<br/>\nthat makes the game even more instructive.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven just playing Tetris all day can give the brain a work out. Eventually,<br/>\nthough they will search out something new because their fingers will begin<br/>\nto hurt. Also, one my son wants to get is the dance party game - I think you<br/>\ncan get it for PS2 as well (we have Xbox). There are days that my son sits<br/>\nand plays with play dough all day - is that any worse then a video or<br/>\ncomputer game?<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of nrskay<br/>\nSent: Monday, January 16, 2006 10:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: How many &quot;Unschoolers&quot; are trying to be<br/>\n&quot;Uncontrollers?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon:<br/>\n<br/>\nI walk away too when I make a suggestion and my dd says no.

Anyway, when I do start telling my son what to do - he tells me<br/>\nhe has had enough and that I need to go away now. Which I do and let him do<br/>\nhis thing. So my suggestion that when you feel that controlling beat spread<br/>\nover you... walk away. You don&#39;t need to watch your kids learn. If they make<br/>\na mess then you help them clean it up. I do believe in teaching taking<br/>\nresponsibility for yourself and that includes cleaning up after yourself.<br/>\nHowever, even that will be done in their own way. If they don&#39;t do it the<br/>\nway you would then let them clean and then clean behind them.
