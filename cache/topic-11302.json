I know I was raised with  this <br/>\nbrainwashing, and I believed it for a very long time.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe more people I&#39;ve met, the one thing I can say is that even though this  <br/>\nidea has been forced on nearly everyone......hardly anyone is truly  <br/>\nwell-rounded!  Most people have a couple of areas where they excel and some  where they <br/>\nare nearly useless.  If you happen to be useless in language  skills, it is <br/>\nvery difficult to get through the school system or college.<br/>\n <br/>\nMost people (outside of unschooling circles, of course) are pretty darn  <br/>\nboring.....maybe that&#39;s being well-rounded in dullness.....except those few that  <br/>\nhave a passion for something.  I&#39;m boring, unless I&#39;m talking about  <br/>\nunschooling.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband is military, so we have a forced social circle.  The  gatherings <br/>\nare wild because people drink excessively.  I think it is  because they are so <br/>\nbored with each other, it is the only way to make the time  together bearable. <br/>\n They all seem to be having so much fun, but nothing is  truly discussed or <br/>\nlearned.  Most of these people have been to college, the  men are mostly the <br/>\nelite (smartest, best of their military class) of the  military and even then, <br/>\nthey are painfully boring.  We have one guy that is  interesting, he is a <br/>\nsculptor and was a fine arts major in college.....different  from the usual <br/>\nphysical education majors the military seems to be full of.   :)  But maybe he is <br/>\ninteresting because he is different, not a truly  interesting person filled with <br/>\npassion.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"&quot;technically&quot; speaking","postDate":"1144239916","msgId":11302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMGN2Yyt0YW5nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11306,"prevInTime":11301,"nextInTime":11303,"topicId":11302,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Why does this country have to make things so difficult for people to be educated in areas of interest only, meaning they can still be self-learned but if they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1241895352\">&quot;Why does this country have to make things so difficult for people to<br/>\nbe educated in areas of interest only, meaning they can still be<br/>\nself-learned but if they WANT to go higher in just one area, WHY do<br/>\nthey HAVE to know a little about everything else?  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAh yes, archaic ideas that need to die out.<br/>\nIn reality, those that specialize are in DEMAND! I don&#39;t know that<br/>\nI&#39;ll ever specialize much in life, being a dabbler is more my style.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were discussing this at work a couple days ago. Some of the MAC<br/>\nartists and I were talking about how lame it would be to attend any<br/>\ncollege makeup artistry courses, because what we want is makeup<br/>\nartistry courses ONLY.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be forced to take English and Math to learn artistry<br/>\nskills. Dumb.  The whole idea of &quot;well rounded&quot; is ridiculous. The<br/>\nparts they want to &quot;round out&quot; are only in certain subjects. Subjects<br/>\nthat you pick up naturally anyway by LIVING!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople are naturally prone to being more focused OR being dabblers (or<br/>\nanything in between). There&#39;s a lot of genetics at work there. If<br/>\nsomeone is interested in a topic, it&#39;s absolutely imperative to delve<br/>\ninto that topic until the interest is satisfied (and maybe it never<br/>\nwill be).<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t get to be a good makeup artist by being coerced into taking a<br/>\nbunch of crap to make me &quot;well rounded&quot;. I got good at it by<br/>\nconstantly learning new skills, reading, attending classes, working in<br/>\nthe industry and asking questions of those more skilled than I.<br/>\nI continue to do these things (also called Learning) in order to gain<br/>\nmore skills as the years pass.  I don&#39;t need someone else deciding<br/>\nwhat *I* need to be &quot;well rounded&quot;.
