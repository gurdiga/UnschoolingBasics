I have finally received relief from the testing issue. I called my coordinator and she told me to not worry about what the test says. She said help him with the problems he needs help with or help him with all the problems. She said to give him all the examples that he needed me to give him. She knows me very well and she told me that she knows I teach my son very well. She also said Cody may have testing phobia and not all children can test. Cody also has ADHD so this makes testing much more difficult. So after all the worry we will not have to worry about testing after all.

I have something to say, again. Before I decided to try unschooling my 2 boys I sent for the CAT Test, it has came in and the boys have started taking it. My oldest, 17yrs, can&#39;t seem to test for anything. He hates testing but the cover school I&#39;m under requires the children to pass this test before he will allow them to graduate. What am I suppose to do since my son can&#39;t seem to test? Is testing even required in Alabama or is it just this cover school? Or if someone has any ideas to help him pass this test please send them my way. He was hoping he could graduate in May, he&#39;s actually in 11th grade this year. As we were looking at the test everything was what he had done in 9th and 10th grades. I&#39;m lost and hope someone out there can help. <br/>\n  Blessings, Cynthia<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nStay in the know. Pulse on the new Yahoo.com.
