Instead describe what is actually<br/>\nhappening. EG: Jayn is crying and stamping her feet, or rolling on the floor<br/>\nscreaming. It helps me not see the actions as endless, or give it more power<br/>\nin my mind. Conversely it helps me not say &quot;it&#39;s *just* a tantrum&quot; and I<br/>\nthen don&#39;t just ride it out without helping Jayn find what she needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next step is to express the best guess at what Jayn is feeling - angry,<br/>\nfrustrated, lonely, hungry, tired, distressed, afraid - whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It sounds to me like you are doing a great job.  <br/>\nAlthough you must be frustrated, it reads as if you are doing all the &quot;right&quot; <br/>\nthings to help your son work through his frustrations and issues.  <br/>\n <br/>\nTwo things.  The first is that we use Rescue Remedy here as well and I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel like it&#39;s a magical solution to stop tantrums in their tracks.  I feel <br/>\nlike helping your body or your child&#39;s body along using herbs can be a good <br/>\nthing.  Sometimes I feel so tight and tense and stressed out I want to scream.  <br/>\nOccasionally, herbs help to bring me out of that feeling.  They might help your <br/>\nson as well and maybe you&#39;ll find them helpful on your path to finding the <br/>\nsource of the problem.  So, just suggesting that you don&#39;t rule it out.  We also <br/>\nuse a California Baby &quot;Overtired and Cranky&quot; spray which contains essential <br/>\noils and you just spritz around your child&#39;s head and back of neck - my son <br/>\nloves it and sometimes just the funny feeling of the nice smelling spray is enough <br/>\nto distract him from his tantrum.  He never gets more mad because of the <br/>\nspray.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe second thing is that I read a Mothering magazine article about kids and <br/>\nhmmm... sorry I&#39;m going to not be totally sure what I&#39;m talking about because I <br/>\ncan&#39;t find the mag, but I thought it was about tantrums.  Emotional release <br/>\nwas a big thing.  It talked about parents doing everything they can to stop the <br/>\ncrying right away but that it wasn&#39;t good for the kids because they needed to <br/>\nscream and cry to release whatever that &quot;stuff&quot; is once in awhile and just <br/>\nget it out.  That certainly doesn&#39;t answer your post about ways to get to the <br/>\nsource of his tantrums, but at least it sounds to me from reading that article <br/>\nthat you are doing a great job being there for him during the tantrum and not <br/>\ntrying to stop it or suppress his feelings.  Hang in there.<br/>\n <br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2459,"nextTopicId":2448}}
