There is a safe area within a person&#39;s frame that weight can be a<br/>\nconcern - it should not be an issue though.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine&#39;s son has a severe weight problem and though he had no<br/>\nrestrictions they have worked together - the doctor, my friend and her son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day they had him write down what he ate - even if it was one grape<br/>\nor one cookie. Then they analyzed the calories, fat, carbs and nutrients.<br/>\nThe doctor noticed that though he was eating a lot of junk food it had a lot<br/>\nof vitamin B in it and so they added a Vitamin B supplement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey then set limits - reasonable limits like drinking enough water as well<br/>\nas other fluids, eating a variety of food and keeping his carb intake to 100<br/>\nor less a day and ways he can do that and still eat his favorite foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that a nutritionist will help you but it may be worth your<br/>\ntime. It wasn&#39;t for my husband or my father who are both Diabetic.

They should stop gaining weight and let their height catch up with their weight.  And gaining weight is the usual response to dieting, so I don&#39;t think that limiting what she eats is a good idea.   Meeting with a registered dietician might be helpful to you.  And shame on your doctor if he didn&#39;t recommend that referral.  Besides what he eats, make sure there is plenty of water easily accessible in a format he/she loves best.  My kids want it cold.  With ice is even better.   Find out how your child likes it.  (I can recommend a reverse osmosis water filter if your tap water tastes bad)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a good idea is physical activity.   Get your child a good pair of shoes and take her for a stroll every day.  Find out what she is interested in doing and then the two of you need to go do it everyday.   Together.  (Is there a heated pool near you?)  Also, I think we all need to be reminded of the value of fidgeting.  My daughter is constant motion.  She literally hops up and down when she is talking!  Talk about burning some calories!   I think we tend to want children to be still.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI get irritated when people start lamenting the fact that kids are heavier than they used to be.  When I was a kid, we were turned loose.  My parents knew I was in the neighborhood somewhere.....  We rode our bikes, wandered around in the undeveloped areas around our subdivision, walked to the TG&Y (a dollar store), climbed trees.  There was very little limitation on our movements.  My kids don&#39;t have that freedom, even though we live in a small town, and I imagine yours don&#39;t either.   It  isn&#39;t considered safe anymore.  We go for bike rides together, but that takes getting mom to stop what she is doing.  That limitation on movement means less exercise.   And heavier kids.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDeirdre</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":218449772,"authorName":"zenmomma@comcast.net","from":"zenmomma@...","profile":"zenmomma2kids","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]new to list","postDate":"1140929249","msgId":10210,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMjYyMDA2MDQ0Ny4xNDY4Ni40NDAxMzJFMTAwMDkwRThFMDAwMDM5NUUyMjA3MDIwODUzMEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":10206,"nextInTopic":10215,"prevInTime":10209,"nextInTime":10211,"topicId":10171,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My 16 year old is upstairs reading. Later he&#39;ll probably be researching websites for an Anime convention he wants to go to in Seattle. For that he&#39;ll use his own money that he&#39;s earned working for the past two years in our family coffeeshop. My 12 year old is creating a dance routine while I post. We&#39;ll watch the end of Harry Potter when I&#39;m done. She&#39;ll also continue reading the Harry Potter series later tonight.  Earlier today she was creating a rescue operation for her stuffed dog and then  treating him in her makeshift animal hospital. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have the freedom to watch tv or play computer all day if they want. They use that freedom to make good choices. They follow their interests. Sometimes it&#39;s tv and computer and that&#39;s great. Sometimes it&#39;s not and that&#39;s great too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;BUT, for my sanity could anyone come up<br/>\n </span></blockquote>with any benefits of watching TV? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTry reading here. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Also, any unschooling tips on how to get my 10 yo to loose weight without being too controlling about it?

I&#39;ve have doctors suggest several things for my kids that didn&#39;t turn out to be either necessary or in their best interest. So I tend to question, ponder and decide for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would focus on having fun together. I&#39;d plan ways to get the family up and moving in ways that appeal to the 10 year old. I&#39;d have lots of nutritious proteins and complex carb foods around to eat. I&#39;d also make sure she knows she&#39;s wonderful and loved just the way she is. <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.
