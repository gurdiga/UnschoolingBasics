I would hate to have to justify my instictive parenting choices to anyone, let alone someone who wants custody rights over my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to go into that meeting armed with lots of paper. Lawyers like paper. &lt;g&gt; Maybe you could print out pages from different websites outlining the benefits of your parenting and educational choices. There have been studies and such showing the benefits of attachment parenting and home education. (I&#39;d probably leave out the part about unschooling right now if you think it will just cause more trouble.) I&#39;d show big, important sounding people talking about the importance of a child being with her mother and the learning that happens from birth. There&#39;s tons out there on the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want your child&#39;s dad to be a part of her life? If so, I would make sure he knows that. If you are trying to keep him out of her life, I would come to the meeting with the reasons for that decision clearly outlined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if this helps at all. Maybe if you ask some specific questions, I&#39;d have a better idea of what kind of help you&#39;re needing.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.
