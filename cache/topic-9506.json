I came in and  asked him <br/>\nif he was enjoying those shows.  He shrugged.  I told him  that those shows <br/>\nwere mostly for adults and that he could watch them if he liked  but he might <br/>\nprefer a DVD or PBS Kids (I really got the feeling he wasn&#39;t  enjoying them, <br/>\notherwise I would have left it).<br/>\n <br/>\nA few weeks later I heard him tell his sister when ASwim came on &quot;these are  <br/>\ngrown up shows, let&#39;s watch something us kids like!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel like he was watching it not because he liked it but because it was  on <br/>\nCartoon Network and he felt like he was supposed to like it.  So  sometimes a <br/>\nkid with freedom doesn&#39;t necessarily see the choice  available and he might <br/>\nneed some guidance in interpreting the world.<br/>\n <br/>\nLast night I was up late watching &quot;Object of My Affection&quot; where Jennifer  <br/>\nAnniston is in love with her gay roommate.  My daughter (5) couldn&#39;t  sleep and <br/>\nstarted watching with me. There are some gentle love scenes between  two men <br/>\nand I thought about these TV discussions.  I was glad that she was  exposed to <br/>\nthis sweet portrayal of non-typical couples in love, something she  probably <br/>\nwon&#39;t see in real life where we live.  I saw no need for  discussion right <br/>\nthen, it either went over her head or she saw nothing  unusual.  Oh, she loves Sex <br/>\nand the City (we watch the broadcast versions),  I think because it has women <br/>\ndressed up and fabulous.  She calls it the  &quot;baby show&quot; because she <br/>\nespecially likes the ones with Miranda&#39;s baby.
