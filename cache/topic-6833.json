The plastic tubing<br/>\nis sold in the pond sections of home improvement stores, or a water<br/>\ngarden store. It&#39;s cheap and sold by the foot.<br/>\nIf you ran a piece from the pump, up under your volcano, then filled<br/>\nthe volcano with runny chocolate, I think it would work. Everytime you<br/>\npushed on the pump, you&#39;d get some nice bubbles and run off. Just pump<br/>\ngently to start with...I don&#39;t know if it could really send some goo<br/>\nflying!! You might end up with chocolate on your ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, it will be a great experiment.<br/>\nIt will be interesting to see what chocolate volcanoes lead into....<br/>\n<br/>\nHow inspirational! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6832,"nextTopicId":6836}}
