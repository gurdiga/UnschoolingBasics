I&#39;ve been wondering what you <br/>\nseasoned unschoolers would do/ do in the situation I&#39;m in right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest, Christian (11 1/2), caught a strep infection. It ended up <br/>\nin a lymph node on the right side of his face/neck area. Tuesday, he <br/>\nwent to the dr, rapid test for strep came back neg/ rest ,etc etc <br/>\nwas the instructions. By Wed, the swelling and discomfort was much <br/>\nworse so I called in and they put him on antibiotics. Thurs the <br/>\nextended test finally came back and was positive. By Friday, <br/>\nChristian looked like he was growing another head on the right side <br/>\nso he went back to the dr. They sent him (with my husband) to the <br/>\nER. I finally got out of work and was there with him at 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on with the crazy experience we had but my bottom <br/>\nline  question is this. How do seasoned unschoolers handle situation <br/>\nlike this? I thought about all of you when Christian was fretting <br/>\nabout getting an IV put in. Also when he had to have a CT scan (at <br/>\nleast it was the open kind and I stood in the room w/him) When he <br/>\nwas being admitted. Etc etc.. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s on the mend now, just to make sure I add that!, but it looks <br/>\nlike he won&#39;t be able to come home until 48 hrs worth of IV <br/>\nantibiotics are administered which brings us to Mon am. He&#39;s VERY <br/>\nunhappy with that but, like they said, it&#39;s important to make sure <br/>\nit&#39;s totally under control before he leaves. ( I had a strep <br/>\ninfection in my finger about 3 yrs ago and it VERY QUICKLY got <br/>\nserious and I landed in the hospital for two and a half days! Argh!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s doing MUCH better, it isn&#39;t an abcess, like they feared, and <br/>\nhe&#39;s much closer to &#39;himself&#39; than he has been in DAYS so we are <br/>\nvery thankful BUT he had to go through many things he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto, that he didn&#39;t feel comfortable about. He did them all, though. <br/>\nThere was no traumatic struggle or anything like that. I listened to <br/>\nhim and tried to comfort him. I was with him the whole time (besides <br/>\ntonight, when my husband is there b/c I&#39;ve not had much sleep in two <br/>\ndays with all of this and don&#39;t want to land in the hospital <br/>\nmyself). I stayed until I knew he was doing better and all the <br/>\nresults were in. I couldn&#39;t leave before that. And, for the record, <br/>\nhe&#39;s totally fine with my husband staying in place of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there are procedures that one has to go through. How does a <br/>\nparent respect and honor the child but still make &#39;the executive <br/>\ndecision&#39; for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nTonya</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22468,"nextTopicId":22506}}
