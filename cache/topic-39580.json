I think they know how I feel, but maybe they don&#39;t.  It does suck.  I really do love the chicks.  I always wanted some myself.  Today we went to the feed store to buy more feed and saw some bantams.  We fell in love with them, too.  I want them just as much as they do.   But, I can&#39;t see spending 40 minutes just driving to take care of them everyday.  That could be the time spent WITH them, not driving to them.  Plus, we would have to build the entire structure, knowing that we really don&#39;t want to keep this drive up indefinitely, yet spending all the money on the coop and hen house.  That&#39;s a lot of dough.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter knows I want them and acknowledges is isn&#39;t reasonable to spend that money and driving time.  But, she says she wouldn&#39;t mind going over there.  We are still looking for other people and locations, but we&#39;ve only got a couple three weeks left.  I can give the 4-H office a couple days notice and they can find someone to take them, but then my kids can&#39;t take them to fair and they really want to do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, this weekend she wanted to go to a friends house and I had to say we can&#39;t unless we find someone to feed and water them.  It is a lot harder than leaving our cat!  He&#39;s easy!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would all be so much simpler if we lived out of town!

Its totally reasonable to talk with your kids about that, put your heads together and do some brainstorming. Perhaps you could sell or give away most of the chicks - check with local feed stores and homeschooling groups to see if you can find takers for them. Where are you? Maybe someone on this list could stand a few chicks, for that matter. Or, if there are any health food stores in the area, see if you can post a flyer. Is there a food buying co-op or a local CSA? Those are great for networking with folks with small farms.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do end up making a top-down decision to get rid of the chicks, be as kind and gentle as you can, but also be prepared to appologise to the kids.

I like the idea of putting the more &quot;schoolish&quot; type things in his basket right alongside everything else--and yes, we are currently working our way through all the Captain Underpants books. (We read them aloud together, taking turns with the chapters. They are hilarious!) Anyway, if the feeling moves him to do a few workbook pages, he can just grab it and start working on it on his own.

In my state, the laws are practically non-existent (you&#39;re not in NJ by any chance, are you?). And I know that if anything ever came up, the onus is on the state to prove that we&#39;re NOT providing an equivalent education, rather than the other way around. Also, I don&#39;t know a single person that has ever happened to, and I&#39;ve been around homeschoolers for a good 20 years. After much consideration, I decided I&#39;m being paranoid, and I should just chill out, write my blog, and stop worrying about it. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, <br/>\n<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Thursday, April 16, 2009 1:44:58 PM GMT -05:00 US/Canada Eastern <br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Our first &quot;yes&quot; and a question <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t most unschoolers have to be able to convert their daily <br/>\nactivities into &quot;eduspeak&quot; for the state? <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say &quot;most&quot; - in some states they have testing, some have <br/>\nlogs, etc. Whether a log is needed depends on the state laws - we don&#39;t <br/>\never have to show anyone anything UNLESS push comes to shove and someone <br/>\ntakes us to court (not an easy thing, since they&#39;d have to have grounds <br/>\nfor neglect to even start the ball rolling).

There&#39;s never an issue of &quot;you (kid) have to be the one to feed it&quot;. They often do, but they also don&#39;t always, every day, without fail, take care of the pets.

We talked with some of our neighbors who do dog-rescue to see if they&#39;d be willing to be the official caretakers of the dog, we also talked with Ray&#39;s bio mom, who has had dogs in the past. Eventually, Ray was able to find another family for the dog to live with.

I&#39;m beginning to see what you mean about the Unschooling Handbook. Lots of great ideas, but I&#39;m realizing that what I&#39;m reading about here and on the sites you recommended is a totally different animal. N ot so much a method as an entire lifestyle. And why wouldn&#39;t it be?

I was an attachment parent when my kids were little, I breastfed all of them into toddlerhood (and beyond). Heck, I was a La Leche League Leader and knew plenty of unschoolers back in the day. But when my kids hit school-age, I don&#39;t know, my childhood programming kicked in and I never even considered doing anything other than send them to public school. (Probably the fact that I&#39;m the daughter of a teacher and school administrator had a little something to do with that...) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;ve added both books to my wish list and will read them ASAP.

It might be <br/>\nuseful as a jumping-off point, and might help if you are constrained <br/>\nby state laws to write things down. But there are better places to <br/>\nlearn about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I was also mentally figuring out how I was going to classify <br/>\n&gt; everything we did on our &quot;learning log&quot;--a grid-like form I got from <br/>\n&gt; a book (the family who used it were unschoolers). I need to keep <br/>\n&gt; some kind of record of what we do, and be able to show (if we&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; ever asked) that we&#39;re providing &quot;an equivalent education&quot; to what <br/>\n&gt; he would be receiving in public school. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you *have to*? <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t most unschoolers have to be able to convert their daily <br/>\n&gt; activities into &quot;eduspeak&quot; for the state? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo! And each state had completely different requirements. <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Am I worrying too much about record-keeping? It&#39;s difficult to look <br/>\n&gt; at that blank grid and NOT think in terms of fitting everything into <br/>\n&gt; neat subject areas. (Although I did homeschool two of my older kids <br/>\n&gt; for several years, and nobody ever asked to see my records.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThrow out the blank grids.

I made the *gift* of<br/>\ncaring for our family&#39;s dog (we&#39;re a team, he&#39;s OURS) a pleasant one to give<br/>\n(as I&#39;d be giving it every day, that was really a gift for ME).

A\r<br/>\nfavorite &quot;craft&quot; when I was an arts & crafts organizer at a week long\r<br/>\nsummer camp was smashing - we (the adult coordinators) would scope out\r<br/>\nsome interesting shaped rocks (maybe an inch in diameter) and spray\r<br/>\npaint them gold. Then we&#39;d mix up some plaster and pour it into paper\r<br/>\ncups. Let it firm up for a couple minutes then drop in the rock. Let it\r<br/>\nset and peel off the cup. Hand the kids a hammer and a nail (or other\r<br/>\nsimilar type tool) and let them sit out in the sunshine outside the door\r<br/>\nand mash that plaster to find the &#39;gold&#39;. It was so popular that we had\r<br/>\nto set up a waiting list because we couldn&#39;t keep up with the demand (it\r<br/>\ntook overnight to set the plaster properly and such so we couldn&#39;t do it\r<br/>\nquite &#39;on demand&#39;  - we&#39;d use the list to gauge how many to make each\r<br/>\nday and try to get each person on the list at least one shot at\r<br/>\n&#39;treasure&#39;).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nEvery so often DS will ask me to make him some &#39;math questions&#39; to do.\r<br/>\nSo I do it - I ask how many he wants me to do, what types (addition,\r<br/>\nmultiplication, etc), how big the numbers should get (does he want 4x5\r<br/>\nor 40x50), and any other parameters that might apply. I might check in\r<br/>\nwith him on whether he recognizes/understands certain symbology before\r<br/>\nusing it (for instance, the difference between 2+(2x5) and (2+2)x5 - is\r<br/>\nthe parenthetical order of operations something he &#39;gets&#39;). He can do\r<br/>\nall of the resulting questions, some of the questions, ask me to clarify\r<br/>\nthem, etc. Sometimes he wants me to check them, sometimes once he&#39;s gone\r<br/>\nthrough it he&#39;s done and doesn&#39;t care to have me check, and sometimes he\r<br/>\nwants me to explain them a bit, how/why it comes out the way it does.\r<br/>\nDoes it look like school? Maybe somewhat. Is it school? Nope - school\r<br/>\npresumes that the &#39;teacher&#39; is in charge and decides what and when and\r<br/>\nhow and such. Some unschooled kids choose to pick up a textbook on some\r<br/>\nsubject or other  - it actually looks like school. But the driving force\r<br/>\nis not the &#39;teacher&#39; but the &#39;learner&#39; and the motivation is internal to\r<br/>\nthe learner not externally enforced. If you&#39;ve already got workbooks,\r<br/>\nput them on the bookshelf next to the coloring books and the Captain\r<br/>\nUnderpants books and the Klingon-English dictionary (yes, we do own one\r<br/>\nof those - DH had it before we got married).

Can you imagine a child feeling overwhelmed by the task of caring for these creatures they love and want and having an adult sweetly come out and help them twice per day?

Expecting him to understand and agree &lt;immediately that recreating school at home will not be allowed &lt;doesn&#39;t take his expections or needs for security or safety into &lt;your lifestyle change. He is stating a need and may <br/>\n&lt;have to reassure himself he can add and subtract in a more &lt;formal manner; so whether it is to do formal math or smash a &lt;toy car there is no need to judge. If he self-directs and insists on &lt;a workbook for math why not give him one or ask him to &lt;consider making up his own &quot;worksheets&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with this 100%. I haven&#39;t given him the impression that workbooks are now verboten--they&#39;re actually sitting right out on the kitchen counter where he left them. (He already did some on his own, last week while he was still in p.s.) He&#39;s a kid who LOVES that kind of thing, so I would never abruptly take them away. I just think that he was waiting for me to say, &quot;Okay now, Logan, today I want you to sit down and do pages 5 and 6...&quot; because to him, homeschooling means that I am now his teacher and should be directing him. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Also, asking his opinion on what he feels comfortable doing &lt;might reveal his need to wean from school slowly, why not &lt;honor that need? If he wants to schedule time and work on &lt;&quot;Math&quot; in the way school presents math divorced from context, &lt;he may find his skills have appeared out of nowhere and when <br/>\n&lt;he &quot;tests himself&quot; with the workbook will feel very confident &lt;about not needing to decontextualize any discipline in order to &lt;learn it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s already got mad math skills! ;) Seriously, he&#39;s such a math whiz that I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t just pick it up and work on it today for fun. He also loves those timed tests (his school called it &quot;rocket math&quot;) and I offered to print a few of those for him, but he wasn&#39;t into it today. I guess I&#39;m trying to find a balance between suggesting, encouraging and supporting without slipping into &quot;teacher mode&quot;, which would be all too easy since that&#39;s what he wants me to do. I respect his need for direction, but at the same time, I&#39;d like to help him understand that he can direct his own learning now. When I homeschooled my two older kids years ago, they became way too dependent on me to tell them what to do. I would like to avoid getting into that dynamic if at all possible. For now, we&#39;re just going to take it verrrry slowly, but I appreciate the reminder to carefully consider his needs.

Don&#39;t think about deschooling your<br/>\n&gt; son--focus on you.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What will help the most is just taking a break. A looooong break. Forget<br/>\n&gt; about school. Forget about math and &quot;music appreciation&quot;--what the heck is<br/>\n&gt; &quot;music appreciation&quot;, anyway, and who cares about that subject other than<br/>\n&gt; teachers who get paid to teach it?

You were adding<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and subtracting, budgeting and buying things, making change, and you were <br/>\n&gt; doing it all in your head, too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>On deschooling:<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that he needs to know the terms &quot;unschooling&quot; or &quot;deschooling&quot;,<br/>\nor really anything about the process initially.  The next time he asks &quot;when<br/>\nare we starting?&quot; tell him that since he stopped going to public school, he<br/>\nnow gets a very long vacation to do whatever he wants...a summer break, if<br/>\nyou will, or a long spring break.  When you talked to him about<br/>\nmath/reading/science/music appreciation, you were talking &quot;schoolish&quot;.  You<br/>\nwere all set to bring school into your home until recently, but now you&#39;re<br/>\nunschooling.  Unschooling looks *nothing* like school or homeschool.  Yes, I<br/>\nknow it&#39;s considered a &quot;form&quot; of homeschooling.  But arguing with your child<br/>\nto prove (to him?  to yourself?) that he&#39;s still learning &quot;school stuff&quot; by<br/>\nplaying Monopoly won&#39;t help you deschool.  It not only stops deschooling in<br/>\nits tracks, but puts you back to square one.  As in, due to that interaction<br/>\nyesterday, consider *today* your very first day of personal deschooling.<br/>\nEvery time you slip into schoolish &quot;how is he learning math today?&quot;<br/>\nthinking, deschooling starts all over.  If he was involved in the schoolish<br/>\ndiscussion, deschooling starts over from square one for him, too.<br/>\nDeschooling could take a matter of weeks/months, OR it could take many<br/>\nmonths/years, depending on how willing you are to just Let Go of the idea<br/>\nthat kids need edumacation.  Deschooling is about the parents questioning<br/>\ntheir own beliefs, in my mind.  Don&#39;t think about deschooling your<br/>\nson--focus on you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will help the most is just taking a break.  A looooong break.  Forget<br/>\nabout school.  Forget about math and &quot;music appreciation&quot;--what the heck is<br/>\n&quot;music appreciation&quot;, anyway, and who cares about that subject other than<br/>\nteachers who get paid to teach it?  JUST PLAY!  Play music on the stereo,<br/>\nloud, and dance.  Get some bongos and go crazy.  Get him some drumsticks so<br/>\nhe can bang on things (inside and outside).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo borrow Diana Jenner&#39;s thinking on this (gawd, this has been so helpful to<br/>\nme):  What would your life look like if your son had an incurable disease<br/>\nthat will probably mean death in 2009?  How would your days look if your<br/>\nonly goals were to connect with him and hear his desires and feed them by<br/>\nplaying with him and helping him play...to help him enjoy life to the<br/>\nfullest?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust tell him he&#39;s on break, and have fun!!! -=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240684971,"authorName":"pellegrina@comcast.net","from":"pellegrina@...","profile":"elysgrl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Our first &quot;yes&quot; and a question","postDate":"1239777425","msgId":39580,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2MDM3MjExMy4yMzQzODQxMjM5Nzc3NDI1NDU0LkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAc3owMTEwYS53ZXN0Y2hlc3Rlci5wYS5tYWlsLmNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39581,"prevInTime":39579,"nextInTime":39581,"topicId":39580,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone-- This is my first post since my intro a couple weeks ago.

I&#39;ve been reading like a fiend and learning so much! My son Logan, 7, had his last day of public school a week ago, so we&#39;re now &quot;official&quot; unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had read that it&#39;s not a great idea to make any grand pronouncements, to just start gently by saying &quot;yes&quot; more. So the first question that tested me--&quot;Hey, Mom, now that we&#39;re homeschooling, can I get a mohawk?&quot;--I said &quot;yes&quot;. In the very recent past, this would have been an instant knee-jerk &quot;no.&quot; I would have been worried about what people would think--of ME. But it&#39;s his head, right? We got some weird looks on Easter, but he actually looks pretty cool. I gotta admit, I kind of admire the fact that he&#39;s self-possessed enough at 7 to just let his freak flag fly. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat first &quot;yes&quot; felt really really good, and soon another opportunity presented itself: &quot;Mom, can I go outside and smash some of my Hot Wheels with a hammer?&quot; First, knee-jerk reaction was &quot;No! I paid good money for those cars! Plus you&#39;ll smash your finger or shoot your eye out with flying hot wheel shards! Why would you want to do something so destructive anyway?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I only said that in my head. In reality, I took a deep breath, handed him a hammer and some safety goggles, and said, &quot;Sure.&quot; He literally did a double-take. &quot;Really??&quot; &quot;Sure, why not? You&#39;ve got like 400 of them. You can spare a few.&quot; I watched him through the window. He was so happy! Every so often he&#39;d run in and proudly show me a particularly mangled one. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the baby steps are going well so far. My question involves DEschooling, I suppose. Today, after what I thought was a particularly unschoolish day--we played the Wii together, we ran some errands, went to the library, read some books, played Monopoly, made dinner, watched American Idol (go Adam!)--he said to me, &quot;When are we going to start homeschooling?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;We already did. Today, you had reading, math, science, music appreciation...&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I didn&#39;t have math!&quot; he burst out. Meaning, he didn&#39;t do any work in the math workbooks I bought before I decided on unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sure you did. We played Monopoly and you were the banker. You were adding and subtracting, budgeting and buying things, making change, and you were doing it all in your head, too.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe looked doubtful, very, very doubtful, kind of like he&#39;s wondering if Mom has any clue what she&#39;s doing after all. I told him we&#39;d talk about it tomorrow, that I was trying something a little different called unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...any advice on what I should tell him at this point? It&#39;s clear that he has certain expectations that involve me acting more like a teacher. I thought I&#39;d start by asking him what he&#39;s been expecting homeschooling to be like, what he wants it to be like, and go from there. I would love to hear from anyone that made the transition from structured or public school to unschooling, and how I might help Logan ease into the idea, without making it seem like some big, scary, life-changing thing right off the bat (even though I am very cognizant of the fact that it may well turn out to be all of those things!) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much in advance for any and all advice, and if there&#39;s anything naively un-unschoolish in my post, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll let me know. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nDenise <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39654,"nextTopicId":39685}}
