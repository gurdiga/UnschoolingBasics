It doesn&#39;t bother me that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want a sports team....but it does bother me how people <br/>\nseem to expect us to sign DS up for &quot;something&quot;.  In fact, I&#39;m <br/>\nstarting to feel a slight anxiety about this now!  Is he missing <br/>\nout?  What exactly is he missing out on??  I&#39;m definately not <br/>\ncomfortable with coersing him into joining something.  I might add <br/>\nthat we are the only ones in our neighbourhood who are unschoolers <br/>\n(and homeschoolers too I&#39;m sure).  I guess I&#39;m just feeling the <br/>\npressure of all my conventional neighbours.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS loves being outside, exploring nature and working in our gardens. <br/>\nHe is really in his element doing those things.  At my mom&#39;s we&#39;re <br/>\nputting a massive veggie garden in and in the evenings, DS wants to <br/>\nhelp me plant and reap.  If he sees a bush that needs deadheading, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll just dig in and do it.  This is one of his loves. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also LOVES tinkering with tools and wood.  He wants to build our <br/>\ndog a house. He also helped build our deck last week. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are his summer activities as well as our camping trips.  His <br/>\nloves....<br/>\n<br/>\nAny opinions out there?  Will the lack of team experience in his <br/>\nyoung years have horrible results later in life?

I have three children.  I have always homeschooled, more<br/>\nrecently committed to an unschooling style.  My husband and I were<br/>\nboth gymnasts, we teach gymnastics, we live athletically, and our<br/>\nchildren have taken to enjoying the sport.  My oldest two are on<br/>\ngymnastics teams.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn their earlier years, they were content with a class or two here and<br/>\nthere.  As they grew, they sought out friendships and peers who were<br/>\ninterested in their own interests.  It happened to be gymnastics.  I<br/>\nfeel that they have led me to this position.  Though I want them to<br/>\nfeel a certain responsibility to their team, I do not wish for them to<br/>\ncontinue if it does not fulfill their wants or needs any longer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to fall into the trap of wanting to do what *everyone* else<br/>\nthinks you should do.  In my experience, my children spent their<br/>\nyounger years clinging to my interests and looking for ways to connect<br/>\nwith me.  As they got to be 6-8 years old (depending on the child...<br/>\nso far in my experience), they started to lead me in different<br/>\ndirections of their interests.  I became a follower.  A supporter. <br/>\nTheir biggest fan.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are feeling pressure, take a step back, ask yourself why you or<br/>\nhe have chosen the activities that you have, and check in with your<br/>\ninstinct.  Are you doing what is right for your boy at this time? <br/>\nChildren change interests and needs rapidly.  Spend your time in the<br/>\nnow.  Offer the world to your child, but be prepared for him to want<br/>\nnothing to do with it till he&#39;s found his own direction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s totally okay to not be involved teams, clubs, sports, etc.  It&#39;s<br/>\nyour job to show him many paths, it&#39;s his choice to step on that path<br/>\nor not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake a deep breath and do what you feel is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\nMom to Lauren (9), Cory (7), and Becca (4)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255816758,"authorName":"beensclan","from":"&quot;beensclan&quot; &lt;beensclan@...&gt;","profile":"beensclan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"clubs, teams and such....","postDate":"1209729191","msgId":32323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2ZXZiNys4dmF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":32328,"prevInTime":32322,"nextInTime":32324,"topicId":32323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone, It is that time of year in my part of the world, when parents sign their children up for sports teams, summer clubs, etc.  My 6 year old son has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-424472362\">Hi Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is that time of year in my part of the world, when parents sign <br/>\ntheir children up for sports teams, summer clubs, etc.  My 6 year old <br/>\nson has no interest in joining anything.  It doesn&#39;t bother me that <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want a sports team....but it does bother me how people <br/>\nseem to expect us to sign DS up for &quot;something&quot;.  In fact, I&#39;m <br/>\nstarting to feel a slight anxiety about this now!  Is he missing <br/>\nout?  What exactly is he missing out on??  I&#39;m definately not <br/>\ncomfortable with coersing him into joining something.  I might add <br/>\nthat we are the only ones in our neighbourhood who are unschoolers <br/>\n(and homeschoolers too I&#39;m sure).  I guess I&#39;m just feeling the <br/>\npressure of all my conventional neighbours.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS loves being outside, exploring nature and working in our gardens.  <br/>\nHe is really in his element doing those things.  At my mom&#39;s we&#39;re <br/>\nputting a massive veggie garden in and in the evenings, DS wants to <br/>\nhelp me plant and reap.  If he sees a bush that needs deadheading, <br/>\nhe&#39;ll just dig in and do it.  This is one of his loves.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also LOVES tinkering with tools and wood.  He wants to build our <br/>\ndog a house. He also helped build our deck last week.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are his summer activities as well as our camping trips.  His <br/>\nloves....<br/>\n<br/>\nAny opinions out there?  Will the lack of team experience in his <br/>\nyoung years have horrible results later in life?  ( I ask that tongue-<br/>\nin-cheek, but this is the thinking in my part of the world.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nMel</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32361,"nextTopicId":32381}}
