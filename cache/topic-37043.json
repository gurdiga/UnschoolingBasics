I don&#39;t live in NY, but what I do for Ray&#39;s <br/>\nmom is to observe what Ray does and &quot;translate&quot; that into schoolish <br/>\nlanguage so that she feels good about his &quot;education&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, a couple weeks ago I gave her a list of &quot;courses&quot; <br/>\n(and forgot to keep a copy! I&#39;m still kicking myself). Top of the <br/>\nlist was &quot;shop&quot;. We happen to have a woodshop and Ray likes to dabble <br/>\nnow and then. So its a convenient way to talk about how he&#39;s learning <br/>\nall about measurement and fractions and angles, blah blah blah... and <br/>\nif we really need to (or she decides to grill Ray) we can pull out <br/>\nsamples of projects to show her. If we were reporting this to a state <br/>\nagency, we&#39;d probably take digital pix and keep a &quot;folder&quot; of them <br/>\nwith notes for some kind of portfolio review. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, you have a 7yo, not a 15yo, so lets see if I can find something <br/>\nfrom *my* 7yo&#39;s life... This morning she got her train set out! Oh, <br/>\nthat&#39;s a cakewalk... what&#39;s something harder? The hamser. Okay, so <br/>\nshe has a hamster and one of these balls so he can run around the <br/>\nfloor and not be stepped on or eaten by cats. She likes to play games <br/>\nwhere she sets up obstacles for the hamster - so she has to estimate <br/>\nthe size of the ball and the amount of force the little guy can exert <br/>\nto get over and through different kinds of spaces. So there&#39;s <br/>\nestimation, measurement, geometry. Periodically he knocks things <br/>\nover - probability, number theory, counting, addition, <br/>\nmultiplication, subtraction. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to report this to anyone I&#39;d take some pix and write short <br/>\ndescriptions. I know the lingo - I used to tutor math - which helps <br/>\nme alot. It might help you to look through some math books from the <br/>\nperspective of learning the language you need to *talk* about math.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an &quot;umbrella school&quot; option in your area? If so, if you can <br/>\nfind one that&#39;s more compatible with unschooling it will make your <br/>\nlife sooooo much easier. We&#39;re umbrella&#39;d through The Farm - the old <br/>\nhippie place in Summertown TN. I don&#39;t think its a valid umbrella <br/>\nschool outside TN, more&#39;s the pity, but they&#39;re very supportive of <br/>\nunschooling. Some of the more intensely Christian umbrella schools <br/>\nare also compatible with unschooling in the sense that they don&#39;t ask <br/>\ntoo many questions about specifics - worth looking into if this is an <br/>\noption for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m honestly not too worried about the other<br/>\n&gt; subjects b/c he naturally wants to learn about science, loves <br/>\n </span></blockquote>books, is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; interested in history, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You might want to do some research on your own - there&#39;s quite a bit <br/>\nof math in science and history, too. Even literature, although you&#39;d <br/>\nhave to be more creative to figure out how to report that. Check some <br/>\ncurriculum resources that include biographies of mathematicians and <br/>\nscientists... that sort of thing. Not so much for him as for you. <br/>\nMontessori sources might also have useful information for you - some <br/>\nof those curricula have options for teaching math *via* other <br/>\nsubjects. Again, I&#39;m not suggesting it for him, but to give you some <br/>\nideas of how to report the very real math he *is* learning - part of <br/>\nthe challenge is that you have to learn to *see* it and &quot;translate&quot; <br/>\ninto terms the state will recognize. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217951851,"authorName":"Christie Craigie-Carter","from":"&quot;Christie Craigie-Carter&quot; &lt;craigiecarter@...&gt;","profile":"c3_2323","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"7 yr old and questions about QRs","postDate":"1226848762","msgId":37043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNGM0ZDBhMDgxMTE2MDcxOWw0ODAzYmMxNnBhMjQ2MzA3MmUyMDcyODJlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37050,"prevInTime":37042,"nextInTime":37044,"topicId":37043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This quarter I m all set, as we did enough Saxon Math to be able to report it on the QR.
