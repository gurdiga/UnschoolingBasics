It was\r<br/>\na given that they&#39;d develop in things like walking, talking, eating with\r<br/>\na spoon and fork, etc in their own way, at their own time. Project that\r<br/>\nforward...that&#39;s unschooling. To paraphrase a song (Tae Kwon Leep by the\r<br/>\nFrantics) Unschooling is not a road to a door but a path leading ever on\r<br/>\nto the horizon.  When you let go of the idea that there actually is\r<br/>\nsomething they might miss or that there is something called a grade\r<br/>\nlevel, then there&#39;s nothing to fear from them - in order to have a level\r<br/>\nor to &#39;miss&#39; something, there has to be the idea that there is a fixed\r<br/>\npackage of something that is required or necessary. If I need 2 eggs to\r<br/>\nbake a cake and I only have one, I&#39;m &quot;missing&quot; an egg. Ponder on the\r<br/>\nthought that EVERY college has remedial classes in reading, writing,\r<br/>\nmath. 98% of all people entering college went to institutional schools,\r<br/>\nthey weren&#39;t homeschooled or unschooled. So, seems to me, even IF a kid\r<br/>\ngoes straight through public school, they may still end up needing\r<br/>\nsomething if they choose to go to college, they&#39;ve &quot;missed&quot; something.\r<br/>\nHeck, there are probably things you know that I don&#39;t and vice versa -\r<br/>\ndid one of us &quot;miss&quot; something? Is there something &quot;wrong&quot; with that?\r<br/>\nOr, rather, are we different people with different interests who held\r<br/>\nonto those things that were of interest and/or useful to us. Also,\r<br/>\nschooling has us trained to believe (a) there is indeed a set packet of\r<br/>\ninformation bits that every person must absorb (b) that information is\r<br/>\nan end in itself. They are both incorrect. Does every person need\r<br/>\ncalculus, physics, German, Asian history? Nope. Literacy and numeracy\r<br/>\n(reading, writing, arithmetic) are TOOLS just like a food processor or a\r<br/>\nhammer.  And, in some cases, those tools are just one way to proceed\r<br/>\nwith a task. A century ago, information was transmitted on the printed\r<br/>\npage and by word of mouth. That was pretty much all you had. Reading was\r<br/>\nimportant. If you wanted to know what happened in the Civil War, you\r<br/>\nread a book, and maybe (back then) tracked down those &quot;old guys&quot; in your\r<br/>\ntown who were there and talked to them about it. Now, can&#39;t find Civil\r<br/>\nWar vets around to talk to (unless you know some folks who are over 140\r<br/>\nyears old). And, yes, books about it still exist (and continue to be\r<br/>\nwritten). But, that&#39;s not it - you&#39;ve got documentary films, websites\r<br/>\nfull of photos, those same books on CD/tape...you can see and hear the\r<br/>\ninformation, not just read it.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs far as the fear of missing something or not keeping up (keeping up to\r<br/>\nwhat?) just in case they have to go back...do you continually base your\r<br/>\nlife in general on fear? Your kids might not live past next week, you\r<br/>\nmight not live past next week. Do you want to base your decisions today\r<br/>\non a fear of something that may or may not happen a year or 5 from now?\r<br/>\nThat&#39;s a great way to suck the joy from today when you have your kids\r<br/>\nright with you.

I assume that this decision was prompted by a desire that your children had to something other than public schooling, which is a hard decision for them, I&#39;m sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll likely get a number of replies to your note suggesting things to read or places to start, so I&#39;ll let the others offer that help. That said, I do have three suggestions for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, don&#39;t have too many expectations about the transition - what it will be like, how long it will take, how well your household will adjust, how permanent it will be. Like all changes, this one will have a life of its own - and you&#39;ll add exponential levels of stress if you have rigid notions about how the transition &quot;needs&quot; to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you&#39;ll get a ton of advice and suggestions, but in my opinion you&#39;ll be happier if you don&#39;t focus on searching for the &quot;right way to do it.&quot; Unschooling is both obvious and subtle, and there are so many variables that it is bound to look and feel slightly different in each family. There are fundamentals, philosophies, principles - but no road map for right and wrong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast, and most critically, have FUN. Learning in freedom is a wonderful journey, filled with many unexpected benefits if you can trust enough to let go and enjoy the ride. I wish you well!<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 4/1/09, lbgjones &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lindajones@...\">lindajones@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: lbgjones &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lindajones@...\">lindajones@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Considering Unschooling<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, April 1, 2009, 8:13 AM<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;             Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re new to homeschooling (in fact, the kids are still<br/>\n&gt; in public school and will be taken out April 24th) and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m considering unschooling - but I&#39;m having a hard<br/>\n&gt; time really understanding what it is and how to do it. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure you have already had millions of posts<br/>\n&gt; regarding this topic, what should I search for to find those<br/>\n&gt; posts?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve also heard a million<br/>\n&gt; times, how do you get over your fear of the kids missing<br/>\n&gt; something or not keeping up with their grade level (in case<br/>\n&gt; they ever go back to school)?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Linda<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt;     <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299167699,"authorName":"lbgjones","from":"&quot;lbgjones&quot; &lt;lindajones@...&gt;","profile":"lbgjones","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Considering Unschooling","postDate":"1238598794","msgId":39235,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyMDBhYStocDBhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":39242,"prevInTime":39234,"nextInTime":39236,"topicId":39235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, We re new to homeschooling (in fact, the kids are still in public school and will be taken out April 24th) and I m considering unschooling - but I m","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1151662569\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re new to homeschooling (in fact, the kids are still in public school and will be taken out April 24th) and I&#39;m considering unschooling - but I&#39;m having a hard time really understanding what it is and how to do it.
