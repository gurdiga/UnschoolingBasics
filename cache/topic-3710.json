LOL! <br/>\n <br/>\nFirst, my husband did not grow up in America.  He has none of the TV  baggage <br/>\nthat I do.  It makes me think that so many of our negative TV  ideas are just <br/>\nplain social conditioning.  I love how they talk about  how bad TV is *on <br/>\nTV*!!<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I grew up in a family that liked TV.  This same family is very  well <br/>\nread.  We often read in front of the TV.  No, we aren&#39;t &quot;do-ers&quot;  like some <br/>\npeople, no one in my family has ever put on a conference of any type,  but if the <br/>\nTV wasn&#39;t there we would probably be reading 24/7.  My mom is a  good example, <br/>\nshe likes all sorts of TV programs from news to documentaries to  crafts to <br/>\nsitcoms.  She is also reading at any given time 5 to 7 books  ranging from <br/>\nlight fiction to literature to history.   I don&#39;t  think it is because she can&#39;t <br/>\nfind anything else to do, this is what she does  because she enjoys it.  If she <br/>\nread classical literature all day people  would call her an intellectual, if <br/>\nshe played a classical instrument all day,  people would admire her passion.  <br/>\nIf she played sports all day, she would  be noted for her athleticism.  If she <br/>\nwatches TV all day, she is lazy and  uninspired.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think our prejudice against TV is intellectual superiority.  I don&#39;t  think <br/>\neverybody needs to install a satellite dish,  but we love ours!   I can admit <br/>\nthat to you people!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC, proud satellite owner since July   :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3906,"nextTopicId":3908}}
