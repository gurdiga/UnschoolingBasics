It appeared safe. I had been recieveing a number of invites from people in groups I was familiar with so I clicked to check out what it was since it seemed a large number of friends were joining. I had no idea that it was auto generating messages. IT had not been even 12 hours since I clicked to see what grouply was about when someone messaged me letting me know what was going on. I had actually been banned for several groups because of it and had no idead at all what was going on. I wish those mods would have emailed me about it because I have been a victim of this site as well. Anyway, I spent half of yesterday making peace, creating new email accounts, deleteing old nicks, chaging passwords, etc etc to secure my email and profile. I was able to get onto grouply and delete (as far as I am aware) any trace of me and sent very worded email to the creators of groupley. It seems though their intentions were innocent they have much work to do on that site as to how the system handles invites and acsesses group information. I got apologies back from them but the damage has been done and I am voicing my opinion to everyone I am in contact with in groups and email.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have sent the mods in the groups I am in messages explaining the situation asking them to warn their groups as a whole. I have also rejoined many of my groups under new accounts just in case. I deeply apologize to anyone who recieved messages seemingly from me. It was NOT me that sent those invite but auto generated junk from grouply masked as my email and identity.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217951851,"authorName":"Christie Craigie-Carter","from":"&quot;Christie Craigie-Carter&quot; &lt;craigiecarter@...&gt;","profile":"c3_2323","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: BEWARE!!
