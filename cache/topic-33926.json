We get a lot more mileage from games by not playing the intended<br/>\ngames or making up our own rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to play a video game and be competitive with yourself and<br/>\nquite another to lose a board game when you&#39;ve played your best.  Especially<br/>\nat 4.  A little embarrassing maybe.  I love to find ways (and it&#39;s a<br/>\nchallenge) to play so that everyone wins.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike with Connect4 ...  how many rows can *we* make?  I can do a little<br/>\nmath, I thought, and find out.  Yet the actual turnout was more than I had<br/>\nfigured on.  If you can count each piece more than once, there&#39;s lots more<br/>\nrows you can make.  Now what kind of picture does it make?  Ds loved that<br/>\nidea too and laughed because he says it&#39;s silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought several much cheaper versions of board games at $5 a piece.  They<br/>\nwere at a place called Family Dollar and were these neat little travel<br/>\ncompact versions.  Ds loves these little games.  I&#39;ve noticed he likes<br/>\nminiatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/23/08, lauramae117 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lauramae117@...\">lauramae117@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I just wanted to share our experience at dinner yeasetday.
