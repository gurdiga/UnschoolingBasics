I feel like I should get everything I need to do out of the way before I can have any fun.  I am a perfectionist (something I have been working on getting rid of) and it is very hard for me to look at a messy house.  Anyone have any suggestions to help me change my mindset.  I feel my priorities are wrong.  I have come a long way in the last year, but still have a &quot;ways&quot;  to go!<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren in Alabama<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Angela Berry <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 08, 2006 9:14 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Getting things done?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I totally get that too about asking my girls what they want to do <br/>\n  today.
