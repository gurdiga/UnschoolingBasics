I live in the Boston area and this <br/>\nis our first’official’ year unschooling with our 6 yr old son. We also have <br/>\n13 month old twin daughters. I flied my letter of intent last week and have <br/>\nbeen surprised at how much anxiety I am feeling over the whole prospect of <br/>\nmaking this commitment. I have been reading and thinking and talking about <br/>\nunschooling for so long and living an unschooling life since my son was a <br/>\nbaby that I ama bit bewildered at how I am feeling. It’s not that I don’t <br/>\ntrust in unschooling or my son, but more that I am worried about being able <br/>\nto take care of my three kids (2 still so very young) and the needs of the <br/>\nhome and family as we move forward on this journey. I feel overwhelmed many <br/>\ndays with just the basic needs of the family and I have to admit that when I <br/>\nhear other non-unschool moms talk about the break they get when kids are in <br/>\nschool, I feel this twinge of wondering maybe if that would be helpful here <br/>\ntoo. But I detest the idea of sending him to school for babysitting <br/>\npurposes!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow have others managed to get thru the days and meet the needs of each <br/>\nfamily member, including yourself, especially with very little ones around? <br/>\nBelieve me, I am not the type who needs a perfect home, perfect cooking, <br/>\nperfect klids, whatever. Just getting the basics done  like a shower once in <br/>\na while and some food in the fridge and content kids would be fine with me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJen, in need of some BTDT from families who have made it thru the baby years <br/>\nin one piece!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6424,"nextTopicId":6423}}
