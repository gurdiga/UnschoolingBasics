I tried to educate her teachers (guidance <br/>\ncounselor, principal etc) about this, but got a lot of &quot;lip <br/>\nservice&quot;.  They were not interested.   So, I figured since I was <br/>\nspending so much time with her at home after school trying to keep <br/>\nher from failing her courses (never mind actually LEARNING the <br/>\nmaterial, how many really remember everything after they&#39;ve &quot;passed <br/>\nthe tests&quot;), then I might as well homeschool her!<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m still trying to understand - anyone have any insight?).&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That makes perfect sense to me - if it&#39;s 4:30 then I&#39;ve been <br/>\n </span></blockquote>reading for an hour and now it&#39;s time to get ready for dinner.

She often also asks what <br/>\nday it is (not being in school, she has no point of reference as <br/>\nshe&#39;s been staying home quite a bit (not many outside activities, <br/>\nlike karate on Tuesdays, etc etc), except for the past 2 months <br/>\nshe&#39;s been going to sing in the middle school chorus twice a week (I <br/>\nthink I shared that story, of how she asked a few months ago if <br/>\nshe&#39;d be able to sing with them for the rest of the year?).  Even <br/>\nthen, I had to remind her the night before that I&#39;d be waking her up <br/>\nearlier than her normal &quot;getting up when she was done sleeping&quot; time <br/>\nto get there on time.   And I had to push her to move out the door <br/>\nto get there ON TIME.  NO sense of urgency, as in &quot;oh, I&#39;d better <br/>\nleave now because I know it takes us 5 mins to get there to be in <br/>\nthe chorus room by 1:15&quot;.

Fortunately, having spent <br/>\nquite a few years sharing a room with a 5 yrs younger sibling, I can <br/>\nsleep with lights, music, TV, just about anything - up to and <br/>\nincluding DS draped all across me (providing, of course, that I&#39;ve <br/>\ngot a wee space to breath through lol).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He also has to have a <br/>\n&gt; running commentary at times when watching a movie etc, which <br/>\n&gt;drives <br/>\n&gt; ME crazy as I&#39;m trying to focus on what&#39;s actually happening and <br/>\n&gt; absorb it for later refection.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes DH will do this - and sometimes he wants to absolutely <br/>\nfocus and not be interrupted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I like to read (he does not) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>DH and I both love reading which works out nice when we all snuggle <br/>\nup, each with a book, and read through a long winter&#39;s night. But, <br/>\nyeah, sometimes he&#39;ll just start commenting on something and <br/>\nI&#39;m &quot;huh? I didn&#39;t catch that - I was reading.&quot; He&#39;s finally learned <br/>\nto signal (say my name or something) and then pause for me to look <br/>\nup before he starts on whatever he wants to say - or he knows that <br/>\nhe can talk and talk and I will eventually catch up - sometimes he <br/>\njust has to say a thought out loud and doesn&#39;t really -need- me to <br/>\nreact to it or respond so he&#39;ll just say it.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;   She&#39;s also a <br/>\n&gt; visual/spatial learner, right brained, big picture, non-sequential <br/>\n&gt; and part of that is her 3-D way of thinking.   <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oddly enough, I&#39;m way more left brained, detailed, list making, <br/>\nprinted word oriented. As I&#39;ve gotten older, though, I&#39;ve moved more <br/>\ntoward the center between left and right brained. My sister is very <br/>\nmuch right brained (graphic artist by training and by choice) - I <br/>\nspent a couple years helping &quot;translate&quot; word problems into picture <br/>\nproblems when she was in high school - once she could picture it, <br/>\nshe had no problem solving it, the words just got in the way and <br/>\ncaused confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Even though she knows <br/>\n&gt; how to tell time by looking at a clock (both digital and analog), <br/>\n&gt; she VERY often asks me &quot;what time is it?&quot;, and that&#39;s when there&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; clock in the same room for her to reference.   I don&#39;t think it <br/>\n&gt; actually has anything to do with wanting to know the actual TIME, <br/>\n&gt; but more with &quot;where am I?&quot; (and that&#39;s not a very good <br/>\n&gt;description, <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still trying to understand - anyone have any insight?). <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That makes perfect sense to me - if it&#39;s 4:30 then I&#39;ve been reading <br/>\nfor an hour and now it&#39;s time to get ready for dinner. Sort of <br/>\nsimilar to when you&#39;ve been on vacation for a week and get home, put <br/>\nyour stuff down, and look around the room *even though no one&#39;s been <br/>\nthere for a week, nothing&#39;s changed*. It&#39;s a way to orient yourself. <br/>\nLike in Dr. Who (the final episode for the season is on tonight! I <br/>\nthink I&#39;m going to miss the current Doctor when the new one starts <br/>\nnext season) one of the first questions they ask is &quot;What year is <br/>\nit?&quot; The answer to that fills in a whole myriad of information - <br/>\npeople, places, situations, events all fall into place just by <br/>\nknowing the year (time). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I <br/>\n&gt; ask her why she asks, she looks at me with a blank expression, <br/>\n&gt;she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; truly unaware of why I&#39;m even asking her.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>well, yeah - to her time and space are all one large entity so <br/>\nasking what time is it? makes perfect sense in orienting oneself to <br/>\nthe environment. I&#39;ll often ask DH or DS what time it is if I can&#39;t <br/>\neasily see a clock and even sometimes when I can, if I know they can <br/>\nalso. DS is 8 and he already knows that quelle heur est&#39;il? (don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if I spelled that correctly) means I want to know what time it <br/>\nis. Or, I&#39;ll tap my left wrist with my right index finger like <br/>\ntapping a watch and they know.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213809267,"authorName":"jlh44music","from":"&quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt;","profile":"jlh44music","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Multi &quot;Noise&quot;","postDate":"1149884738","msgId":14273,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2Y2xnMis5cm90QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZEMTA2NzlBLTkyREEtNDdFOS05MEQwLTE2QTgzRUIxRDhFM0Bjb3gubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":14272,"nextInTopic":14277,"prevInTime":14272,"nextInTime":14274,"topicId":14250,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... working on being more accepting of it, but I don t know how. right now I just breath and tell myself it s normal.

Otherwise it wandered - I&#39;d be writing a sentence and wondering if Mom had been to the store yet or if my boyfriend was done with basketball practice -- whatever. I think it is my own personal &quot;attention trait&quot; -- I also read three or four books at a time - Not a disorder - just a thing I like to do!
