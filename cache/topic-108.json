It may have <br/>\ncome across as so because, like I said, we decided to relax the food <br/>\nissue over a holiday weekend, then visited my parents&#39; where there <br/>\nwas constant access to junk/sweets.  We allowed the kids to bring <br/>\nhome &#39;treats&#39; offered by family (why do they always try to force us <br/>\nto take home all the junk?) which we rarely do.  Also, before the <br/>\nweekend, I allowed the girls to &#39;purchase&#39; toostie pops and ice cream <br/>\nat the store (without thinking about the holiday coming up) because <br/>\nwe have been out of easter candy for awhile.

This (moderation) doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem all that restrictive to me.

If Ava (younger dd) needs a nap, Ava goes to the kids&#39; <br/>\nbedroom.  If I need quiet time or a nap on the couch (which is more <br/>\nand more often, as I am 8 months pregnant) we have been trying to <br/>\ngive Orion the choice of a chilling out in the living room chair with <br/>\na quiet activity, reading books, watching a movie at low volume, etc. <br/>\nbut she has not been able to remain quiet enough to let me rest (I <br/>\nhave always been sensitive to noise and it has increased during this <br/>\npregnancy).  She simply cannot sit or keep her voice low for any <br/>\nlength of time -- she is a mover and constantly talks or sings to <br/>\nherself, and cannot resist initiating conversation.  So if my need is <br/>\ngreat and dh is not occuppying our bedroom, a few times we have asked <br/>\nher to go there for a short time with some books and toys, while I <br/>\nlay on the couch. I do not feel comfortable leaving her alone in the <br/>\nrest of the house while I rest in the bed (too many possibilities for <br/>\na 5yo).<br/>\n<br/>\nSigh.  I guess this &#39;other issue&#39; is really about conflict of needs <br/>\nand how to go about solving these kind of conflicts in a way where <br/>\neveryone feels respected, and satisfied.  I don&#39;t want to force my <br/>\nkids to do anything anymore, but coming to that place is really <br/>\ntaking effort and much more creativity/abilty than it seems we have <br/>\nat times!

Have cantaloupe, honeydew, and <br/>\nwatermelon chunks available in the fridge in small baggies so the kids <br/>\ncan grab one on the go.<br/>\nTry putting a little cinnamon on apple slices - have them cold or, in <br/>\nthe evenings, heat them in the microwave.<br/>\nCelery sticks with cream cheese and raisins is called &quot;ants on a log.&quot;<br/>\nPeanut butter balls (dried milk, honey, peanut butter, raisins) We like <br/>\nthese frozen.<br/>\nTrail mix - again, have it available in little baggies so they can grab <br/>\nit quickly.<br/>\nMini boxes of raisins.<br/>\nCute little cheeses.<br/>\nPudding - store bought or make your own.<br/>\nCustard in little cups.<br/>\nPeanuts in shells!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are all the great frozen treats:<br/>\nchunks of banana dipped in melted chocolate or caramel and rolled in <br/>\ncoconut - this is just SO good - thin the chocolate or caramel so it is <br/>\njust a thin coating.<br/>\n<br/>\njuice frozen in ice cube trays<br/>\n<br/>\nand our all-time most favorite never-get-tired-of-it treat is FROZEN <br/>\nGRAPES!!!!

Why couldn&#39;t you have been separate with <br/>\nyou in your room, hubby in the garage (I gathered?) and daughter <br/>\nwherever she was content - her room, living room, kitchen... etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother control <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; issue...or a sanity issue?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When I am about to drop over, I tell the kids as much.

A couple times of that and there&#39;s <br/>\na good chance:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.The magic will be gone as the taboo has been lifted. <br/>\n<br/>\n2.She&#39;ll likely realize all on her own that maybe a whole box of <br/>\ncookies at one sitting doesn&#39;t really agree with a person most often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI seriously doubt she&#39;ll end up eating entire boxes of cookies on a <br/>\nregular basis.

Once she gets her fill and realizes <br/>\nthe barrier isn&#39;t going back up, and that she&#39;ll be able to help <br/>\nherself to whatever is on the buffet whenever she&#39;s feeling the <br/>\nneed, the binging will pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, I see now.

Not <br/>\nthings that are hard for the kids to just grab or that need prep.  <br/>\nMy kids love having a veggie platter in the fridge... chopped up <br/>\nveggies and a dish of ranch dressing... sliced cheese on a plate <br/>\ncovered in plastic in the fridge... and some crackers... think of <br/>\nthings that are easy to grab.  I even eat &quot;junk&quot; if I&#39;m not feeling <br/>\nlike prepping something - even if I&#39;m craving something healthy.  <br/>\ntsk.  :)<br/>\nI got the suggestion from another list to start by saying yes <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more often, but it almost seems like you are suggesting total <br/>\n&gt; freedom?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I believe that is exactly what we&#39;re suggesting.

And to offer my support.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are struggling with just these issues at our house.  My ds Ben is<br/>\n4 and his diet is atrocious, when he chooses to eat at all.  (My 11<br/>\nmonth old eats more than he does.) My heart says to step back and let<br/>\nhim make his own choices about what he eats, but my head says he<br/>\ncan&#39;t be trusted to make good choices.  But how can he learn to make<br/>\ngood choices without being able to make his own choices and learn<br/>\nfrom the consequences?  And round it goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps if it were easier for him to get his own foods that were<br/>\nhealthy he would eat them more.  It is so easy to pull out a cookie<br/>\nor a popsicle or fruit leather.  Not so easy for him to get out<br/>\nveggies or fuits or even open a cheese stick.  Hmmm....I&#39;m going to<br/>\nmake a bowl in the fridge and a bowl in the cupboard of good stuff<br/>\nthat he can have free access to and see how it goes.....I&#39;ll keep you<br/>\nposted!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJonell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- melissazietlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Zietlowfamily@...\">Zietlowfamily@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;When she stays at my mother&#39;s, she is allowed anything she<br/>\n&gt; pleases <br/>\n&gt; (unlimited sweets), and therefore rarely eats healthy food over <br/>\n&gt; there.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **But if being able to make her own choices was not a special treat<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; she wouldn&#39;t feel a need to binge when the opportunity presents <br/>\n&gt; itself.**<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Today we were at my parents&#39; and no sooner had we arrived than a<br/>\n&gt; box <br/>\n&gt; of chocolate covered graham crackers was discovered.

As we walked away, Orion said she <br/>\n&gt; wanted more cookies.  I said we left them in the garage.  She said <br/>\n&gt; she wanted to go back to the garage to see grandpa.  I said, &#39;I<br/>\n&gt; think <br/>\n&gt; you want to go back to the garage to eat more cookies.  I would <br/>\n&gt; rather you did not do that because I am about to make dinner and I <br/>\n&gt; think you may be too full to eat the good food I make if you eat <br/>\n&gt; more&#39;.  She said &#39;no I won&#39;t&#39; and I let her go to the garage.  She <br/>\n&gt; and sister had several more there, then brought the box back to the<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; patio with them.  They took turns playing and coming back for more <br/>\n&gt; cookies -- Orion eyeballing me all the time, younger dd asking me<br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; more.  I allowed it without making a big deal, except to ask Orion<br/>\n&gt; if <br/>\n&gt; she thought eating 10, 11, 12 (TWELVE!!) cookies before dinner was<br/>\n&gt; a <br/>\n&gt; good idea.  She said she would eat dinner, which she of course did <br/>\n&gt; not.  I tried so  hard not to show my complete frustration, and<br/>\n&gt; even <br/>\n&gt; allowed a popsicle (!!)  before we left, because they beg for one <br/>\n&gt; when ever we leave there.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I have been trying to communicate my feelings and opinions about<br/>\n&gt; her<br/>\n&gt; about her food choices instead of controlling,&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; **I would be careful about doing this.

On the way home we stopped at<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; my grandmother&#39;s (next door) and she promptly started whining for a<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; cookie.  At this point I was losing my patience and focus, and said<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; no, because she had so many cookies and a popsicle already, and did<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; not eat her dinner. I told her that I would really like to let her <br/>\n&gt; make her own choices about what she eats, but I would like to see<br/>\n&gt; her <br/>\n&gt; make some healthy choices, so that I know her body will grow <br/>\n&gt; healthy.  Then I talked a little about sweets and snack foods, and <br/>\n&gt; the fact that they do not give us energy that lasts, and that is<br/>\n&gt; why <br/>\n&gt; she was still hungry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As we pulled in the driveway, she said, &#39;Mom, I want a healthy<br/>\n&gt; snack <br/>\n&gt; before bed -- PBJ sandwhich&#39;.  So she had 1 and 1/2 (ALOT for her).<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; We also negotiated milk instead of a can of grape pop (which she <br/>\n&gt; brought home from family function and is not normally allowed to<br/>\n&gt; have <br/>\n&gt; at all).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So goes our first week of new mindset.  Ugh.  I am so conflicted,<br/>\n&gt; and <br/>\n&gt; hope I am not damaging them in this process!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Melissa Z.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.

If she is still getting the <br/>\nmessage that you do not think she will make good choices what she <br/>\nchooses could be in reaction to that rather than based on what she <br/>\nmight actually want.**<br/>\n<br/>\nI am failing this one in a huge way.  On the way home we stopped at <br/>\nmy grandmother&#39;s (next door) and she promptly started whining for a <br/>\ncookie.  At this point I was losing my patience and focus, and said <br/>\nno, because she had so many cookies and a popsicle already, and did <br/>\nnot eat her dinner. I told her that I would really like to let her <br/>\nmake her own choices about what she eats, but I would like to see her <br/>\nmake some healthy choices, so that I know her body will grow <br/>\nhealthy.  Then I talked a little about sweets and snack foods, and <br/>\nthe fact that they do not give us energy that lasts, and that is why <br/>\nshe was still hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we pulled in the driveway, she said, &#39;Mom, I want a healthy snack <br/>\nbefore bed -- PBJ sandwhich&#39;.  So she had 1 and 1/2 (ALOT for her).  <br/>\nWe also negotiated milk instead of a can of grape pop (which she <br/>\nbrought home from family function and is not normally allowed to have <br/>\nat all).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo goes our first week of new mindset.  Ugh.  I am so conflicted, and <br/>\nhope I am not damaging them in this process!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":187496042,"authorName":"Kym Dean","from":"&quot;Kym Dean&quot; &lt;kdean@...&gt;","profile":"catsmeowjewelry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question/comment","postDate":"1086058473","msgId":134,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZORUlKTk9DSUpFTUhHT0lLTUhJSUVHQURFQUEua2FkQG5lb24tY2l0eS5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PEZORUlKTk9DSUpFTUhHT0lLTUhJSUVGTkRFQUEua2FkQG5lb24tY2l0eS5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":133,"nextInTopic":135,"prevInTime":133,"nextInTime":135,"topicId":108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, all.

LOL&nbsp; Of course, I said yes to the first 3 and no \n      to the 4th.&nbsp; :P&nbsp; Just kidding!&nbsp; I was dying!&nbsp; After \n      she started to &quot;get it,&quot; we talked about the possibilities.&nbsp; She \n      loved the fact that she would be called names, hit, pinched, pushed, or \n      made fun of.&nbsp; How sad is that???&nbsp; The other thing she liked was \n      that there were no pop quizzes!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Other than that, she liked \n      that she would be with me (hey, I got to take it while I still can!&nbsp; \n      LOL), and that we could learn whatever she wanted, whenver she wanted to \n      learn it instead of waiting for the teacher to get to that topic.&nbsp; \n      After talking about it a bit, we decided we would do a little bit this \n      summer to get used to the idea (not much, but a little), and then she just \n      started going on about everything she wanted to learn!&nbsp; It was \n      great!&nbsp; It was funny, because she started trying to come up with \n      ideas for field trips, and her ideas were to go to the store to buy \n      something and to go to a family members event (like a school play).&nbsp; \n      Ok, so she doesn&#39;t totally get it.....I told her those are things we do \n      normally and wouldn&#39;t really qualify as field trips, but would qualify as \n      learning!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So, on to my question......</font></span></div>\n      <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-872349000660265600-01062004\"><font face=\"Tahoma\"\n size=\"2\"></font></span>&nbsp;</div>\n      <div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-872349000660265600-01062004\"><font face=\"Tahoma\" size=\"2\">The first \n      thing Cae wants to learn after school gets out is how to make a teepee and \n      everything about them!&nbsp; How cool!&nbsp; So, I need some good \n      resources about where I can find a how-to on these if someone has \n      it.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking we will make one big enough for the backyard, but \n      thought we could make one for her dolls if that is too much of a \n      chore.&nbsp; The next thing is that she wants to learn about &quot;Abraham \n      Lincoln or whoever it was that invented electricity.&quot;&nbsp; Ok, what the \n      heck have they been teaching this kid???&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; So, Thomas Edison \n      and electricity will be next.....any ideas on cool projects for \n      that??&nbsp; I figure that will be good for the summer since she will be \n      doing a lot of camping with my mom.&nbsp;

ANyway, we play \n      this in the car on trips to see our family (2-3 hour drives), but it could \n      be played anywhere.&nbsp; We call it the ABC game.&nbsp; You take turns (1 \n      starts with A, then the next B, etc).&nbsp; You get 3 guesses to figure \n      out the word they are thinking of.&nbsp; After the 2nd guess you can ask \n      for a hint.&nbsp; Rarely do we get it right, and sometimes we bend the \n      rules a little (like she gets a 2nd clue out of me, or gets one after the \n      1st guess), but she has a ball and the words she comes up with are \n      phenomenal!&nbsp; I didn&#39;t even know she knew some of these!&nbsp; Most of \n      her guesses are 7 or more letters!&nbsp; It&#39;s a great vocabulary \n      builder.&nbsp; SOmetimes our clues are things like....it ends with a t, or \n      it has an r in the middle.&nbsp;

Once the novelty wears off, it should settle <br/>\ndown.  Plus, don&#39;t forget to have plenty of good stuff around the <br/>\nhouse - fruit, melon, string cheese, etc... as well as some sweets. <br/>\nHow about making some chocolate covered bananas or caramel apples?  <br/>\nIt&#39;s fun to do, tastes good, and you get sweets and fruit all at <br/>\nonce.  :) <br/>\n<br/>\nI was more &quot;controlling&quot; about it with my girls - especially the <br/>\noldest who is 20 now.  By the time my son came along (now 8), I was <br/>\npretty lax.  (We&#39;ve even had &quot;dessert&quot; before dinner, or instead of -<br/>\n one of my faves was the occasional hot fudge sundae for lunch.  Why <br/>\nnot?  If you want a hot fudge sundae, what is the sense in filling <br/>\nup on food that is &quot;good&quot; for you first - then you&#39;re full and the <br/>\nsundae isn&#39;t nearly so enjoyable.)  He&#39;s actually the best eater of <br/>\nthe three of them as far as choosing &quot;good&quot; foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here&#39;s a fine example of the result.  The other day, we went to <br/>\na restaurant.  He ordered not from the children&#39;s menu, but from the <br/>\nadult side dishes - he usually orders from the adult menu as he <br/>\nlikes the variety.  Anyway, he ordered 3 slices of bacon, cottage <br/>\ncheese, and a half a cantalope.  That may not be overall the <br/>\nhealthiest combo on the planet, but it&#39;s better than deep fried <br/>\nchicken chunks and french fries (the only thing ever on a kids <br/>\nmeal!)... The waitress asked how we got him to eat &quot;healthy&quot;.  He <br/>\nsaid, &quot;I just do it myself&quot;   He eats candy too sometimes, don&#39;t get <br/>\nme wrong.  But candy and cheese and fruit and yogurt and cucumber <br/>\nslices are all equal choices in his mind... it just depends on his <br/>\nmood at the moment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd funny, none of my three kids likes cake - we stick candles in <br/>\nother things for birthdays - pudding, pizza, shrimp scampi - <br/>\nwhatever they are into that birthday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a friend ask what kind of cake my son had for his recent <br/>\nbirthday.  When we told him that Jay didn&#39;t want a cake - that none <br/>\nof the kids even liked cake, the friend said... those kids aren&#39;t <br/>\nright.  lol.  He says that a lot - but lovingly.  They&#39;re <br/>\nnot &quot;normal&quot;... the way they eat, the way they think, the interests <br/>\nthey pursue, the way they are - and all these things I think is what <br/>\nmakes them so awesome.  They are definitely themselves - enough so <br/>\nthat the world seems to take notice sometimes.  Most of all, they&#39;re <br/>\nhappy.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Alyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159596184,"authorName":"melissazietlow","from":"&quot;melissazietlow&quot; &lt;Zietlowfamily@...&gt;","profile":"melissazietlow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"FOOD for Thought","postDate":"1086026600","msgId":108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5ZnMxOCtvMjdnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":111,"prevInTime":107,"nextInTime":109,"topicId":108,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello again, As I seriously reconsider the unschooling lifestyle/mindset, I have been trying to let go of my hang-ups on regulating food.

This is a <br/>\ntopic I have seen much discussion about, but was not really ready for <br/>\nuntil now.  It came up after one of my recent posts to the discipline <br/>\nboard, but I thought it might be more appropriate to pursue the <br/>\nconversation here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been very confused and hung up on making healthy diet choices <br/>\nfor my children since birth.  I have always thought it was my duty as <br/>\na parent to see that they eat right, and have limited sweets, etc.  I <br/>\nhave been very skeptical as to how kids can learn right choices about <br/>\nfood at young ages, if they are allowed to eat what they choose.  I <br/>\nalways thought kids will of COURSE choose what tastes good, and of <br/>\nCOURSE sweets and junk food taste better than most other things!  <br/>\nAfter all, when they are very young, they cannot understand what <br/>\nhealthy means. To me, this has been logical thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I posted on another list: My hang-up is that my older dd is very <br/>\npicky, and I worry she will not get enough healthy food in without <br/>\nintervention. If we allow her to snack/drink before a meal, she will <br/>\nnot eat the meal, etc. When she stays at my mother&#39;s, she is allowed <br/>\nanything she pleases (unlimited sweets), and therefore rarely eats <br/>\nhealthy food over there. I notice she whines and begs over food <br/>\nthere, and then she comes home and throws up or keeps me up all <br/>\nnight. It really irks me. I keep coming back to the thinking that she <br/>\nis not mature enough to self-regulate in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got several responses from another list that have made me re-think, <br/>\nand over the last several days, I have allowed Orion more freedom in <br/>\nchoosing what she eats when.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this <br/>\nwas a holiday weekend and everywhere we went, there were sweets and <br/>\njunk food.  She has gorged herself full of both and eaten very little <br/>\nhealthier food.  I inwardly almost had a heart attack over what she <br/>\nconsumed at these family gatherings. Surprisingly, she did not get <br/>\nsick this time, but I almost did!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been trying to communicate my feelings and opinions about her <br/>\nfood choices instead of controlling, to which she has listened but <br/>\nstill chose to eat chips over pasta salad, etc.  I have been told <br/>\nthat a child will binge when first tasting (ha) freedom, but then <br/>\nwhat can I expect?  It is not easy to sit back and wait to see.  I <br/>\nfeel such a sense of parental responsibility for her health!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":227,"nextTopicId":150}}
