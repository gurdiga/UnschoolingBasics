When I seen your name I had to open the post.  You are<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; wonderful and encouraging someone.  I think that helping her step through<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; her obstacles is what she was asking for and some of us were not as<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; encourgaging.  I just wanted to personally thank you -- you are one that has<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; always had great ways to help me through hang ups and dilemmas I have had<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and do have through out my unschooling path.  thank you for your light.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ---<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&#92;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you very much. I am happy to know that my journey has helped another<br/>\n<br/>\nfull and connect more fully with her child/ren. As flattering as that is, I<br/>\n<br/>\ndo believe that everyone on here is offering encouragement in the form of<br/>\n<br/>\nhelpful advice. Each person needs are different and what you or I may think<br/>\n<br/>\nis harsh another harsh another person may find to be exactly what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally love a direct kick in the butt style. I have been practicing<br/>\n<br/>\nkindness more since Meredith wrote that amazing post a few weeks ago and I<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that is reflected more in my writing style.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI love this list for what it is, a huge community of folks helping one<br/>\n<br/>\nanother their own way. Each of us comes with our own different way.Whatever<br/>\n<br/>\nhelps people grow on the unschooling journey is wonderful :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember that if you read something that offends you first try to<br/>\n<br/>\nfigure out why. Dig deep. Challenge yourself. And if you don&#39;t need it or it<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t resonate let it go and accept that it likely helped someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://faithvoid. blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.bearthmama. com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40196,"nextTopicId":40123}}
