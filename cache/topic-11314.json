We rented Mario  <br/>\nparty a  month ago or so, and the kids and I had such a good time  <br/>\nwith it. We decided we wanted to buy it, at which point Josh  <br/>\nexplained that there were seven versions! I was shocked, but we  <br/>\ntalked about it for a while, and he called around to all the used  <br/>\ngame stores to see which versions they had, and how much they were.  <br/>\nWe went to Toys R Us (just he and I) and played all the different  <br/>\nversions, and then agreed which one we liked best. In the end, when  <br/>\nhe was camping this weekend with the scouts, i went to Game Stop and  <br/>\nbought his favorite version, along with a membership card. He was so  <br/>\nthrilled to come home and find that on his desk. I felt like I did  <br/>\nsomething right!<br/>\nWe played it Sunday afternoon, most of Monday and a great deal of  <br/>\nyesterday.<br/>\nWe also went and bought Narnia yesterday, so we&#39;re waiting til  <br/>\neveryone is awake today, and going to pop a big bowl of popcorn and  <br/>\nwatch it as many times as we want ;-)  It&#39;s making the chickenpox go  <br/>\nby much more quickly!
