He started asking for more and I said<br/>\nwell I have this recipe that might make something like what you had - want<br/>\nto try it? He asked if he could make it any color he wanted and I said of<br/>\ncourse. We even went out and bought more food dye color so he had more<br/>\noptions.

He generally goes to bed when the last adult<br/>\ngoes to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think as he gains full independence and do more for himself, I think he<br/>\nwill have more freedom.

This list because it helps to redirect &quot;school&quot;<br/>\nthinking and coercive parenting in a way that is more forgiving, is not seen<br/>\nas a radical unschooling list.  Many newbies may not even know what Radical<br/>\nUnschooling is and what it entails.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, like you, there are many many times where I don&#39;t respond when I want<br/>\nto and/or rewrite my replies because I keep the &quot;basics&quot; in<br/>\nunschoolingbasics in mind.  I realize that there are many who come here who<br/>\ndon&#39;t even have a grasp on what unschooling is at all.  I most certainly don<br/>\nt want to scare anyone away by getting radical on them until they seek it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n-------Original Message-------<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen<br/>\nDate: 02/27/06 19:34:10<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] some questions<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;well, being that this isn&#39;t a radical unschooling list, you won&#39;t get<br/>\na lot of negative reaction to your need to control your children in<br/>\nany way.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what led to this impression, since most of the regulars<br/>\nand  both moderators and owners are radical unschoolers!!:)<br/>\nWe try to gently point people towards radical unschooling since it IS<br/>\na beginners list.  I bite my tongue a lot when I read some<br/>\nposts...I&#39;ll admit.  There are a lot of posts I just don&#39;t hit the<br/>\n&quot;send&quot; button on!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the list description it says &quot;... this is a place for you to<br/>\ndiscuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural<br/>\nlearning and how it affects our ENTIRE lives. From parenting issues to<br/>\nlearning from the whole wide world and beyond....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re here to explode the myths about traditional parenting, we&#39;re<br/>\nhere to tell you that you CAN give your child freedom to choose and<br/>\nthey will be fine, we&#39;re here to say that controlling food,<br/>\ncontrolling tv/video games etc... is NOT going to help unschooling unfold.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s up to each person what they use and don&#39;t use here. Nobody is<br/>\nhere to tell you how to run your household, just offer up useful<br/>\nadvice that could potentially be lifechanging. <br/>\nI think every step closer to unschooling is a step closer to better<br/>\nrelationships and more joyful/peaceful households...so it&#39;s all good.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home<br/>\nschool education <br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Middle school<br/>\neducation <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
