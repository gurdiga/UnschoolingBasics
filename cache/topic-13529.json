By the time I was<br/>\n6 mo. pregnant I looked 8-9 months.  People were always coming up to me<br/>\nsaying, &quot;Oh must be twins.&quot;  No, I was just huge!  Speaking of rude people<br/>\nDH and I stopped at a buffet diner in a small town btwn Dallas and Houston.<br/>\nI (an already abnormally beg eater though I&#39;ve never been bigger than a size<br/>\n8) was loading my plate, when an elderly woman next to me says, &quot;You know<br/>\nyou&#39;re not really eating for two.&quot;  I thought DH was going to take her out.<br/>\nSo like others have said, no matter what the situation you&#39;re going to meet<br/>\nrude disapproving people.  Just gotta keep your chin up.  I agree that if it<br/>\nhappens again it&#39;s important to let your ds know it was them not him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13332,"nextTopicId":13530}}
