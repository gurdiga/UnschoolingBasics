I don&#39;t know that we could ever change her mind. I am only a year younger than she is and it took a little to show me that with all the resources out there now days (for example T.V., Libraries, Computers - all the stuff our ancestors did not have), why make children go to a traditional school unless they chose to go?

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love her. However, on another \r<br/>\nboard about 2 days ago, there was a post about her essay contest for \r<br/>\nher newest book club selection, and the fact that homeschooler are \r<br/>\nNOT eligible to participate in the contest. Here are some exerpts:\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;Oprah&#39;s essay contest excludes homeschoolers\r<br/>\nHost taken to task for requiring &#39;state accredited&#39; education\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;Contest open to all legal residents of the U.S. who are currently \r<br/>\nenrolled full-time (and in good standing) in a public or state-\r<br/>\naccredited private or parochial school, grades 9-12,&quot; states the fine \r<br/>\nprint on a page explaining the contest on Winfrey&#39;s website. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDespite the restriction, a letter from Winfrey announcing the \r<br/>\ncontest, which will judge essays on the book &quot;Night,&quot; says it is \r<br/>\nopen &quot;to high school students across America.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMichael Smith, president of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, \r<br/>\nor HSLDA, wrote an open letter to Winfrey protesting the policy. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;We contacted your show to see if homeschoolers could be included and \r<br/>\nwere rebuffed,&quot; wrote Smith. &quot;While we do not believe that your show \r<br/>\nwillfully excluded homeschoolers, the fact that homeschoolers were \r<br/>\nexcluded in the first place is troubling.&quot; \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIan Slatter, a spokesman for HSLDA, told WND he spoke to an Oprah \r<br/>\nrepresentative about the policy. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&quot;We asked whether or not they could make an amendment to the rules to \r<br/>\nallow homeschoolers to participate, and they were not willing to do \r<br/>\nthat,&quot; Slatter said. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAccording to Slatter, the Oprah organization would not commit to \r<br/>\nallowing homeschooled students to participate in future contests.&quot;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n~Carri Ann~\r<br/>\nmom to Star Wars/lego obsessed 10 y/o\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYAHOO!
