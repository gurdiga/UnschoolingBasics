We had a busy weekend but I was reading the replies. Something Meredith said struck me about my son’s best friend all of the sudden turning into a drivers ed teacher. That made perfect sense. I spoke to him about it, asking him if that’s the way he felt. Before I could even finish he was nodding his head. He said it threw a weird dynamic into our relationship. He said he’s used to us being on equal footing and all of the sudden I’m there with a clip board trying to instruct him. He said it was a pride thing. (I’m not sure I understand that-maybe a guy thing?) He also apologized for the way he has spoken to me. I told him that I thought we should tackle this the way we have always tackled things and that’s with compromise. We talked about my 4 big issues-driving with your knees, texting, speeding, and following too closely. We discussed each one and why it was dangerous and how to avoid it. He agreed to do better with those things and I agreed to keep instruction to a minimum, as long as he was driving safely. He does drive well when he wants to. Our talk went on for quite awhile but that’s the gist of it. After we talked his body language relaxed and he seemed like his old self. I’m sure I did too. We have less than a month left until he gets his license and I’m thinking that now that we understand each other we’ll get through this just fine. <br/>\nThanks so much for the thoughtful responses. <br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49221,"nextTopicId":49219}}
