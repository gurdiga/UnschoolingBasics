Tying shoes is just like that, your brain will be ready and  you&#39;ll <br/>\npractice and practice and then you&#39;ll do it!&quot;  Someone gave me that  advise once, and <br/>\nit really helps my kids smooth over those feelings.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for math and the other comments being made, somewhere on my unschooling  <br/>\njourney I learned that math is nothing more than permanence, pattern and  <br/>\npredictability and the language (symbols) to discuss these concepts.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son can easily understand the concepts, but is unable to speak the  <br/>\nlanguage well.  Once we go into the land of symbols, it falls apart.   Anytime your <br/>\nbrain engages the &quot;three p&#39;s&quot;, you are doing math and that is  probably most <br/>\nof the time.  Now, speaking the language is a different thing  entirely, some <br/>\npeople catch on easily and for some people it takes longer.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhich brings me to my next point.  On another list, we discuss that  some <br/>\npeople are visual/spatial or right brain learners.  This learning  style tends to <br/>\nunderstand the whole concept long before the individual  parts.  Would your <br/>\nson benefit by you telling him that his brain will  understand math (and that <br/>\nis very cool!) before his brain will want to *do*  math? (or some variation of <br/>\nthat?).<br/>\n <br/>\nMy doctor recently tried to tell me that my son might have mental  <br/>\nretardation because he couldn&#39;t do first grade math.  I said &quot;well, he CAN  do first <br/>\ngrade math, but not written problems....you are asking him the wrong  questions&quot;. <br/>\n Of course, that made no impact on the doctor, but I kept  thinking if my <br/>\nunschooling friends were around they would totally get it!!

Fox.  He was talking<br/>\nabout his education and he said he never had any patience for math.  He said<br/>\n(paraphrased), &quot;Two and two is always four.  What good is that?  No matter<br/>\nif you do it or I do it or someone else does it, two and two will always be<br/>\nfour.&quot;  I thought about how true that was.  Math is (mostly) finite in the<br/>\nway it operates.  Whether you learn 2+2=4 when you are 4 or 40 it is always<br/>\ngoing to be the same.  So why not learn it when you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it may be important to remind your son that he *is* doing math all the<br/>\ntime.  When he helps you in the kitchen he is doing math.  When he is<br/>\ncounting the blocks or red lights until you get home he is doing math.  When<br/>\nhe is keeping score on a game and needing to collect x-number of points to<br/>\nget &quot;whatever prize&quot; he is doing math.  You can&#39;t escape from math!  It&#39;s<br/>\neverywhere you look.  Just because he can&#39;t do *arithmatic* doesn&#39;t mean he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t understand math.

Both my boys had vacations with my in <br/>\nlaws (one at a time) and my typically VERY non confrontational MIL <br/>\nmust have fed him some things because now he&#39;s saying &quot;I dont even <br/>\nknow math!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and don&#39;t know how to tie my shoes!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 7 and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to read&quot; Well, the shoe tying is true but I told <br/>\nhim, &quot;Uh, you can LEARN if you want to&quot; As far as the math and <br/>\nreading, I gave him an example of &quot;I have 6 lollipops. How many do <br/>\nyou and your brother and sister get?&quot; and he knew and I told <br/>\nhim &quot;That&#39;s math!&quot; And then, when he&#39;s playing games on the <br/>\ncomputer/game cube, he can read &quot;Game over&quot;, &quot;Loading&quot;, etc etc! <br/>\n*LOL* So, what I&#39;m getting at is Rory only attended preschool for <br/>\ntwo years (of which he had a BLAST!) and half day K for a year and <br/>\nhe&#39;s ALREADY thinking that you can&#39;t learn unless you are in school <br/>\nor sitting with workbooks.

Delayed to<br/>\nwhat?  Delayed to some arbitrary guideline that says what children &quot;should&quot;<br/>\nbe doing by a certain age?  Those guidelines work well for children who are<br/>\nin school and for a school that needs to run smoothly.  The school system<br/>\nhasn&#39;t figured out how to educate 30 children who may not all be on the same<br/>\nlevel.  So they have classifications that tell parents where children should<br/>\nbe by a certain age in order to fit in with the rest of the class or<br/>\nschool.  Here&#39;s an even scary thing:  the charts that doctors and &quot;child<br/>\nexperts&quot; use for developmental advances are also based on how to best get a<br/>\nchild ready for school.  It&#39;s like grades and grade levels.  They are<br/>\ntotally irrelevant to an unschooling lifestyle.  They are a means for a<br/>\nlarger &quot;machine&quot; to operate smoothly.  They have nothing to do really with a<br/>\nchild&#39;s ability or understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say he is making advances and I ask you, &quot;Advances to what?&quot;  As you<br/>\nlearn more about unschooling you will find that you need to deschool<br/>\nyourself.  Stop thinking in terms of grades, grade levels, developmental<br/>\nadvancements.  Through mindful parenting, living joyfully and being where<br/>\nyour child needs to be you will see  your child grow and expand and become<br/>\nthe person that is best him.  By stopping the schooling earlier it will help<br/>\nyou get to joyful living sooner and seeing how unschooling can enrich your<br/>\nlives more fully!  It can be a scary step when you have a child whose needs<br/>\nare different from &quot;normal&quot; but later you will ask yourself why you ever<br/>\nfeared taking that step and why you didn&#39;t embrace this change sooner!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] newbie in Rhode Island","postDate":"1154873600","msgId":16322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ5MzUxQUMzLTM5RUUtNDZEQS04NEFDLTZBOTUwMUNFNTZFM0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA2MTEyOTU2LjExODc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1OTAxLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA2MTEyOTU2LjExODc3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1OTAxLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16319,"nextInTopic":16323,"prevInTime":16321,"nextInTime":16323,"topicId":16294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jen, I just wanted to second what Ren said, I m not going to judge YOU on what you do, everybody makes their own choices.

A  <br/>\nlot of people join and say their kid has this or that, as a way to  <br/>\nexcuse away why they *have* to do this school, or that therapy, or  <br/>\nsome kind of training. I just wanted it out on the table that there  <br/>\nare already people here who radically unschool their children with  <br/>\nsevere disabilities, and it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter had a great program too...she loved school! Preschool for  <br/>\ndisabled kids is easy, laid-back and usually little more than  <br/>\nbabysitting (of course, there are exceptions...I&#39;ve heard gramercy  <br/>\nschool in NY is great). What happens when they get older is that they  <br/>\nare either put into a program for severely disabled, and are  <br/>\nbasically babysat, or they are mainstreamed. I have seen it over and  <br/>\nover again (I&#39;m a parent advocate for the autism society) that the  <br/>\nkids have these ideals of how school should be, and then suddenly the  <br/>\nrules change. Someone who needs structure has a hard time dealing  <br/>\nwith change!! If it works out differently than that, it&#39;s because the  <br/>\nparents have advocated and fought for the modifications they need,  <br/>\nand actually wind up doing most of the work ensuring that the schools  <br/>\nand teachers follow the IEP, because they get sneaky when it gets  <br/>\nhard (I&#39;m not bitter, honest ;-)  I&#39;m thankful things went wrong so  <br/>\nsoon after regular ed started for Bre, it was the kick in the pants  <br/>\nwe needed)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think basically what I said in my first email, was to watch him  <br/>\ncarefully for signs of discontent. If he&#39;s like my Josh, he seems  <br/>\nhappy because it&#39;s what he knows. He likes the structure....and he  <br/>\naccepted that school is what it is...even when people were laughing  <br/>\nat him (yes, in kindergarden). Yes, preschoolers are vicious,  <br/>\nespecially in large, barely managed groups. Both my middle girls went  <br/>\nto regular preK, and I was blown away by how knowledgeable they are.  <br/>\nJosh was out of school for 18 months before he said that he didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow back then that the way he felt was ambivalent. He liked the  <br/>\nschool because it was predictable, he liked it because they told him  <br/>\nconstantly how &#39;good&#39; he was and how smart he was. He had no  <br/>\nintrinsic value of self.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I say anything, it&#39;s because I worry about any kid sent to  <br/>\nschool, but especially because I&#39;ve been where you are now....<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 6, 2006, at 6:29 AM, Jennifer Long wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yes and he&#39;s extremely high functioning.

I dont know what it is. I really didnt join this list boasting about how great school is-I happened to briefly mention that my son was in preschool and everyone kind of took it from there. I really appreciate everyone&#39;s input believe me, but I still have to say that it may take ME a while to adjust to an unschooling life style. I went thru a typical school and graduated, etc... and its not until I had put my daughter into preschool (which didnt work out either) that I started seriously looking at homeschooling as an option. Its that<br/>\n scared feeling of turning down therapy, possible further delays, that always kept me away from taking the plunge and living our lives the way I always thought was best. And with my son, well, he just kinda went in the same direction my daughter has gone except that he LOVES school. I&#39;ve always been 110% involved in every aspect of their schooling and I have no problem whatsoever pulling him if I feel he needs to be pulled. My daughter actually was going to get speech therapy this year and I&#39;m completely turning it down to keep her home.

There are a lot of unschoolers who sent their children to <br/>\nschool before they knew about unschooling, and virtually all of them <br/>\nwish they had never sent them to school.  Once children get the idea <br/>\nthat they need someone else to teach them in order to learn, it can <br/>\nbe really hard for them to trust their own ideas and abilities <br/>\nagain. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe natural process of learning to speak or read is wonderful and <br/>\nmysterious and very individual.  I think that it is contradictory to <br/>\nsay there is nothing wrong with your son EXCEPT that he&#39;s speech <br/>\ndelayed.  A delay implies that someone is not doing something when <br/>\nhe should, and we are saying that perhaps your son is learning <br/>\nexactly when he should for his own unique development.  There are <br/>\nmany many children who hardly speak at all at the age of 3 or 4 and <br/>\nyet they speak perfectly well a few years later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son may enjoy going to school.  Lots of kids do.  But there are <br/>\nother ways for him to be social without the restrictions of school.  <br/>\nEven the most play-based schools and therapies still have <br/>\nexpectations, and even kids as young as 3 can sense these <br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and just to let you know-there is nothing wrong with my son.

Just because some kids get <br/>\npulled for therapy shouldnt mean there&#39;s something WRONG with them. <br/>\nThats the kind of thinking that makes kids who are pulled out THINK <br/>\nsomething is wrong with them when there isnt. He is so young still <br/>\nthat who in the class is even thinking there&#39;s something wrong with <br/>\nhim? No one.

My brother was<br/>\nabout that age as well before he was talking in sentences. I &quot;spoke&quot; for him<br/>\nfor the first 3 or 4 years of his life.  After I went to school he had to<br/>\nlearn some words but would speak in one word (and preferbly monosyllabic<br/>\nones at that) &quot;sentences.&quot;  Lots of &quot;point and grunt.&quot;  My brother still<br/>\nisn&#39;t much of a talker.  He talks when necessary.  He&#39;s a man of few words.<br/>\nWhen he does talk we listen.  With Keon he was frustrated at not being able<br/>\nto communicate his wants and needs.  My brother not so.  My brother was so<br/>\nlaid back and adaptable that if he wanted apple juice but was given orange<br/>\njuice he would just drink it.  Keon would spill it in a rage as I didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand what it was he wanted.  While I think that having him speak at a<br/>\nyounger age would have been wonderful, all the speech therapy in the world<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have worked any faster.  He would have learned to speak when he was<br/>\ndevelopmentally ready.  We can&#39;t make those synapses connect faster by going<br/>\nto therapy.  They are going to form at their speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell you the number of times that I have had friends whose<br/>\ntraditionally schooled children were in speech therapy and after *years* of<br/>\ntherapy &quot;suddenly&quot; it all paid off.  It didn&#39;t &quot;suddenly&quot; pay off.  The<br/>\nchild *finally* got to a point where they could comprehend what was going on<br/>\nand most likely would have gotten there with or without therapy, but<br/>\nprobably with a whole let less stress, self-doubt and without feeling<br/>\nlabelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an uncle that I remember that as a child (we are only a few years<br/>\napart) had a horrible speech impediment.  L&#39;s, R&#39;s, and F&#39;s were all<br/>\npronounced like W and S&#39;s were SH.  He also did something else weird.  Only<br/>\nthose of us that knew him well could understand him.  My grandfather refused<br/>\nto put him in speech therapy (basically because my grandfather didn&#39;t want<br/>\nhim labeled &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;special needs&quot;)  Suddenly in 6th grade his speech<br/>\ncleared up.  Today you could never know that he had any problems speaking.<br/>\nI miss my grandfather.  He was a self-educated man who quit school when he<br/>\nwas 14 to go to work on the railroads.  He would have been my biggest<br/>\nsupporter of unschooling.  I think he could really relate to the way that I<br/>\nam raising my children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":273016258,"authorName":"Jennifer Long","from":"Jennifer Long &lt;jenjen71379@...&gt;","profile":"jenjen71379","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] newbie in Rhode Island","postDate":"1154794711","msgId":16296,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA1MTYxODMxLjYxMDY3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1OTA4Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGViMmJmaSs2NjdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16294,"nextInTopic":16298,"prevInTime":16295,"nextInTime":16297,"topicId":16294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren, I was reading the welcome message and one of the things that was posted was that anything you put in a post is pretty much up for discussion: I LOVE this!","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1317695268\">Ren,<br/>\n   I was reading the welcome message and one of the things that was posted was that anything you put in a post is pretty much up for discussion: I LOVE this!
