Because each time I somehow missed the<br/>\n&quot;pivotal&quot; moment ... that&#39;s assuming it&#39;s something you can SEE<br/>\nhappen!   I was determined with my 4th child that I was going to watch<br/>\nclosely!   Each of my kids have started off with a love a books, been<br/>\nread to constantly etc... each reach a point in their individual<br/>\ndevelopment where they would ask how to spell something or what does<br/>\nthis word say or write something and want me to tell them what it says<br/>\n... this past week my 6 yr old was writing words like &quot;balooky&quot;  which<br/>\nonce he heard pronounced he thought hilarious!   From there he said<br/>\n&quot;oh balooky rhymes with lacooky&quot;   and off he went writing lots of<br/>\n&quot;nonsense&quot; words that rhymed.  They don&#39;t have to be real words to get<br/>\nthe idea of rhyming and sounds like this and that... Dr. Seuss made<br/>\nquite a nice living of doing just that.   I think like everything else<br/>\nthey explore it when they are ready and on their own terms ....they<br/>\nask us for help when they need it.  I hate nothing more than to see a<br/>\nchild ask a parent what a word is and they get this whole long ...<br/>\nwell sound it out what does this letter say and what does this letter<br/>\nsay now put it together ...meanwhile the kid is in tears and just<br/>\nwanted to know what the word was he didn&#39;t ask for a lecture or a<br/>\nlesson on what letters say!   To me that&#39;s just showing them how<br/>\n&quot;hard&quot; reading is and killing the desire!  It&#39;s different if the kid<br/>\nwants to know what this letter says or that letter says or wants help<br/>\nsounding out.  If my kids ask what a word is I tell them...usually the<br/>\nnext time they encounter it they know the word!  <br/>\nWe have lots of things that the kids can handle as well... a moveable<br/>\nalphabet, lots of Montessori objects and word cards, the pink, blue<br/>\nand green word matching cards and such as that.  They love to pull<br/>\nthose out and spell out the objects with the alphabet letters because<br/>\nit&#39;s fun... they haven&#39;t been drilled on it because that is NOT fun! <br/>\n   Mostly they see us read magazines, books, games, cards etc and are<br/>\nimmersed in a print rich environment.   My kids love books and will<br/>\nask for a book if given their choice of getting something in any<br/>\nstore.   One relishes a reference book like no one else on earth..it<br/>\nused to bother me that she didn&#39;t enjoy fiction.... I just didn&#39;t call<br/>\nit reading if she was poring over reference books... I enjoy fiction<br/>\nand thought she was missing out!   I had to let go of that perception<br/>\nand alot of perceptions along the way like everyone else!  <br/>\nTo me seeing my kids read for the first time is just as exciting as<br/>\nthose first wobbly steps! <br/>\nLisa B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":280852700,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"&quot;Schuyler&quot; &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyler_waynforth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Reading Question","postDate":"1190738716","msgId":26484,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBkOTkwMWM3ZmY5MyQ3NDFiMjU4MCQ0MDAxYThjMEBEYXZpZD4=","referencesHeader":"PGZjYmgwcStwMm5yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OEM5Q0Q5OTNFRjlBNDJDLTM2OC00MEQ5QEZXTS1NMDQuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26474,"nextInTopic":26500,"prevInTime":26483,"nextInTime":26485,"topicId":26168,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Thanks for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see this the first time, I still haven&#39;t completely caught up after <br/>\nhaving returned from the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I have two children who are both coming to terms in their own way <br/>\nwith reading. Simon, who is 10, isn&#39;t quite reading yet. Or, at least, not <br/>\nat a point where he could read a whole book on his own, although he has read <br/>\na few Asterix and Obelix comics on his own (he says that some of the longer <br/>\nwords he just skips over, and with Goscinny&#39;s sense of humor there are a <br/>\nquite a few long names). Linnaea, who is 7, has been reading fluently for <br/>\nmaybe 8 months, maybe 10. When she started reading there really wasn&#39;t any <br/>\nobvious run up to reading. She was ready and she was interested and she <br/>\nread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think that if Simon applied himself, he would be reading, but I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think that anymore. I don&#39;t think it is a lack of intention, I think <br/>\nit is a lack of readiness. I&#39;m not saying this because Linnaea&#39;s reading is <br/>\nsomehow evidence that I am creating an environment rich with reading <br/>\nopportunities. I am more saying that because his approach to reading is so <br/>\ncompletely different from Linnaea&#39;s. It is an almost methodical approach. We <br/>\nwere in the car with my mom a couple of weeks ago and Simon and Linnaea were <br/>\ntrying to spell words. Simon was either absolutely nailing spellings or a <br/>\nvowel off. So black was blck sort of thing. Linnaea was miles away. She&#39;d <br/>\nstart a word and then go wandering off letter by letter, until she was so <br/>\nfar away from what she was trying to spell that there was no way I could <br/>\nguess what she was attempting. There is, for her, at this point (or at the <br/>\npoint 4 weeks ago) a disconnect between what she sees on the page and what <br/>\nshe can see in her head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there is any way that I could make Simon read. And if there <br/>\nwas, if by sitting him down and making him do worksheets and work on <br/>\nflashcards I could make him read,  at the end of that process Simon would <br/>\nknow that reading was hard and ardous and that he was kind of stupid when it <br/>\ncame to reading, and probably wouldn&#39;t really want to read. But right now, <br/>\nnot being a fluent reader, he knows that his relationship with words is his <br/>\nown. He knows that Linnaea may be reading now but he will be reading <br/>\nsomeday. He doesn&#39;t have any doubts. I keep thinking he will, I keep <br/>\nthinking the fact that many of his friends read will distress him, and it <br/>\nabsolutely never does.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess, what I would tell your friends and family who are sure that not <br/>\nbeing taught to read means that you end up with illiterate adults is to <br/>\nfirst ask how many of those illiterate adults went to school. I mean if not <br/>\nbeing taught to read means you end up illiterate, surely being taught to <br/>\nread makes you literate, right? Given an interesting, engaging environment <br/>\nthat has reading as an aspect in it (and reading is an active part of much <br/>\nof our lives--video games, television, books, magazines, comics, road signs, <br/>\ngrocery stores, typewriters, computers, the internet, game cheat codes, and <br/>\nso on) children will want to solve the puzzle, and when they are <br/>\ndevelopmentally ready, they will solve that puzzle. Giving them a piece at a <br/>\ntime, slowly prepping them for the day they are supposed to read will only <br/>\nwork if the day they are supposed to read coincides with the day that person <br/>\nis ready to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that is too much to say, maybe that is for a deep conversation. Maybe <br/>\nyou&#39;d be better off just saying they are doing a lot of pre-reading work. <br/>\nAlso make sure you tell your friends and family, that they aren&#39;t doing it <br/>\nalone. They are doing it with you and with each other, that it is just part <br/>\nof growing and developing. And you aren&#39;t asking them to do it in a vacuum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Reading Question","postDate":"1190731269","msgId":26474,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOUNEOTkzRUY5QTQyQy0zNjgtNDBEOUBGV00tTTA0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZjYmgwcStwMm5yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZjYmgwcStwMm5yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26313,"nextInTopic":26484,"prevInTime":26473,"nextInTime":26475,"topicId":26168,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooled children learn <br/>\njust fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that unschooled children don&#39;t learn to read <br/>\n&quot;completely by themselves.&quot; *We* are there to answer their questions. <br/>\nWe supply tons of books and magazines and magnetic letters and games <br/>\nand computers and ...whatever we can find that has letter and words. We <br/>\nread for them. We read to them. We listen as they read to us. We play <br/>\nwith words and letters. We sing songs and make up poetry. We solve <br/>\nriddles. We joke. We play with words---words are not to be feared.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools choose to try to teach thirty children in the same way. Those <br/>\nwho can already read or who are ready to read are ushered on as <br/>\n&quot;readers.&quot; The rest are left struggling, thinking they are stupid and <br/>\nare forever non-readers. They grow up like that. Because they&#39;ve been <br/>\nlabeled. So they become adult non-readers---but then they&#39;re called <br/>\nilliterate.

It was very cool to watch. That kind of reading to kids  <br/>\n(or maybe &quot;reading for&quot; is a better term) is very very significant  <br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what they want to know how to read.

We read to her since<br/>\nshe was little. She knew some of those little kid<br/>\nbooks by heart. When she wanted to learn to read, she<br/>\npicked up those books and tried to associate the words<br/>\nshe knew with the words on the paper. She didn&#39;t do a<br/>\nwhole lot of that.

She had no use<br/>\nfor any &quot;easy readers&quot; because she found them boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son did something similar when he wanted to learn<br/>\nletters. First of all, he had no use for letters till<br/>\nhe could learn entire words - such as his name and his<br/>\nsister&#39;s name. Then one day he asked me to put the<br/>\nmagnetic letters in order on the refrigerator.  Then<br/>\nhe sang the ABCD song many times while touching each<br/>\nletter as he sang it.

Also schools divide<br/>\nreading into many small steps that are to be mastered<br/>\nsequentially. But there was nothing linear and<br/>\nsequential in the way my daughter learned to read. She<br/>\ncan read long words when they appear in context, in<br/>\nsomething that interests her - like Yu Gi Oh cards and<br/>\nI&#39;m sure she&#39;ll fumble on many of the &quot;100 sight<br/>\nwords&quot; if presented as a list.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon&#39;t let your dream ride pass you by.
