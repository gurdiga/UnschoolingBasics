What I&#39;d do is find a way to give<br/>\nhim what he&#39;s &quot;needing&quot; in a way that is not hurtful to the other people in<br/>\nthe house.  So given his age, what I&#39;d do is first of all, is get behind the<br/>\nneeds...I&#39;d respect that for him it&#39;s important to try this &quot;role&quot; he&#39;s<br/>\ncalling &quot;mean&quot; on right now, that he needs to act out something he saw so<br/>\nthat he can &quot;own&quot; it.  It&#39;s his way of learning about what he saw, to make<br/>\nsense of something that he saw or heard someplace.  So I&#39;d work on ways for<br/>\nhim to do this.  I&#39;d give him some &quot;mean&quot; materials - some soft balls or<br/>\nsmall stuffed animals or something he can throw without hurting someone and<br/>\nexplain they are for when he wants to pretend he is &quot;mean&quot;.  For the<br/>\nhitting, biting and scratching, maybe you could suggest a big stuffed<br/>\nanimal, or just ask him what he thinks he could use so that he&#39;s not<br/>\n&quot;really&quot; hurting anyone.  He&#39;s already got the message from you that the<br/>\nother stuff hurts, but what he doesn&#39;t have is a suggested outlet for what<br/>\nhe wants to do that doesn&#39;t hurt anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":91534698,"authorName":"Bethryco@aol.com","from":"Bethryco@...","profile":"bethryco","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"toddler frustrations","postDate":"1094868291","msgId":3110,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlLmQyNDFkNS4yZTczYjc0M0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3115,"prevInTime":3109,"nextInTime":3111,"topicId":3110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So I m fairly new to the unschooling thing.

Not ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1900344457\">So I&#39;m fairly new to the unschooling thing.  It&#39;s definitely what I want for <br/>\nmy son who is still a toddler and I&#39;m working on the &quot;living it&quot; as well.  Not <br/>\njust waiting for him to grow up so we can do it.  :)  KWIM?  Of course you <br/>\ndo.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy little boy is a doll and I love him totally and completely.  He going <br/>\nthrough something right now where he crinkles his nose at me, which means he&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;mean&quot; (a word he uses) and will throw the closest object at my head or try to <br/>\nhit, scratch or bite me, his older brother (my stepson) or his dad.  It happens <br/>\nmuch more often with me and his brother thought.  I&#39;ve tried lots of things.  <br/>\nThe thing that doesn&#39;t work at all is to get mad at him.  It makes that cute <br/>\nlittle nose crinkle even more and his aim gets better!  But I find myself <br/>\ngetting more and more frustrated with this behavior.  I try my best to keep my cool <br/>\nand get down to his level.  Talk to him about how hitting hurts, blocks are <br/>\nnot for throwing they are for building, and/or letting him know that if he <br/>\nthrows/hits with whatever object he is holding I will take it away.  I&#39;m sure this <br/>\nis just a phase he is going through.  I&#39;m just looking for some suggestions <br/>\nwhile I wait this one out.  Anyone have any ideas??  This seems to me a good <br/>\ntime to &quot;live it&quot; and I just want to make sure I&#39;m handling it well.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3062,"nextTopicId":3105}}
