They each lost a child. <br/>\nAt five (car wreck), at eight (falling through ice), and at nine <br/>\n(leukemia).<br/>\n<br/>\n  There&#39;s *nothing* that brings me back to what&#39;s important faster than <br/>\nthinking---for just a moment: &quot;What would I do without him?&quot; &quot;What if <br/>\nhe weren&#39;t here at all?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Slams me right back into the &quot;now&quot; in the blink of an eye.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *I* need LOTS of alone time. Duncan needs LOTS of stimulation and to <br/>\nbe surrounded by friends. One family just moved to Atlanta---took <br/>\n*three* of his friends! I&#39;ve had to be more available lately---*just* <br/>\nwhen I need MORE alone time. It&#39;s really hard. It makes me *very* <br/>\ntired. I can do small spurts of it, but day after day after day is <br/>\nvery, very hard for me. The team&#39;s been and continues to be stretched <br/>\nthin: Ben&#39;s working longer days lately, and Cameron just left for a <br/>\nweek in Oregon---they&#39;ve been very unavailable for him too lately. It&#39;s <br/>\nall fallen on me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Duncan&#39;s ten, so it&#39;s a bit easier than with a five year old! &lt;g&gt; I <br/>\ncan ask him to play upstairs a few hours and let me have a few <br/>\nuninterrupted hours to myself. August has turned into <br/>\n&quot;Get-it-yourself-month&quot; around here---I&#39;ve asked him to cut down on the <br/>\n&quot;Mom, can you get me...&quot; requests and just come down and get things <br/>\nhe&#39;s capable of.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But the advice you&#39;ve already gotten---to fill him UP---helps a bunch. <br/>\nI asked for a few hours to myself yesterday, but only *after* we&#39;d <br/>\nspent the day together shopping and running errands. Plus, his new iPod <br/>\narrived yesterday, so he could play with that (AFTER *I* had downloaded <br/>\na bunch of songs for him! &lt;g&gt;). We&#39;re leaving in a bit today for <br/>\nCarowinds (theme park), where he and I will play all day together. That <br/>\ntime totally devoted to HIM will fill him for a while (drain me! &lt;g&gt;). <br/>\nBut he will get what he needs of me, wholly and completely, which will <br/>\nalso allow me to have some quiet time alone. When *he* is filled up, he <br/>\ncan allow *me* to fill up. It&#39;s a dance. Not as easy a dance to learn <br/>\nas the one with my older son, who has the same temperament that I do! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt; But we manage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My guess (because I&#39;ve been there! &lt;G&gt;) is that you&#39;re thinking of him <br/>\nas a burden. Really and truly---just changing *your* thinking will <br/>\nchange the way *he* acts!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Know that every moment could be your last. Start enjoying the time you <br/>\n*do* spend with him---TRULY enjoying that time, and he&#39;ll start needing <br/>\nyou less. Well, it&#39;ll *seem* that way. He&#39;ll still need you, but he <br/>\nwon&#39;t BE as *needy*.<br/>\n<br/>\n  AND...he gets older every single day. &quot;This too will pass&quot;---better <br/>\ncarve it on your forehead or tattoo it on your ass... &lt;g&gt; Nothing lasts <br/>\nforever---enjoy each moment you DO have!<br/>\n<br/>\n  OH!

Your kids will be all grown, have lives of their own and you will have days when you wish for the company of an inquisitive (even &quot;demanding&quot;) youngster. I am very rarely alone ( I even have people look for me when I make a 30 second run for the bathroom;).<br/>\nI have 6 very energetic, inquisitive, marvelous kids living at home so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever have an empty home ;)  My &quot;alone&quot; time is usually right now (a.m.).  Maybe you could work around the kids sleep time?  That way you get your time & you&#39;re refreshed for when they need you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****You mentioned you son is like this, what do you do when he gets to frustrated and you can&#39;t be there immediately?****<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I drop what I&#39;m doing & go help him.  I really try during the day not to get involved in something I cannot leave at a moments notice. I find with Coty that the longer he has to wait for that help the longer it takes him to calm down. <br/>\n I have other kids here so they help out at times but I can&#39;t expect or totally depend on them to be able to help the situation.  Sometimes its just a matter of ME being there.  When I find Coty is getting frustrated with something first I try & help out but if that doesn&#39;t work, I work on getting his attention on something else. Sometimes I go thru 10 things before we find one thing that works.<br/>\nA song ( loud singing & crazy dancing;), a book, making cookies, my new rocking chair works great, a massage - sometimes I do him & sometimes he wants to do me !, something he can take his frustration out on (punching bag, smashing crackers for a future casserole, even ripping up newspaper works), we&#39;ve even had an indoor &quot;snowball&quot; fight with balls of newspaper, and best of all lots of really big hugs !!<br/>\nIf you can find someone else to help out that would be great if he just needs help, but sometimes there is no substitute for MOM ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n**** We do have a room just for trains, but the tracks get broken or he wants them different.****<br/>\n<br/>\nCoty&#39;s favorite thing is making new tracks. Sometimes he makes the tracks & doesn&#39;t even run the trains on them.

She<br/>\nmade sure that it has crossings and overpasses and places to<br/>\n&quot;uncouple&quot; trains but it was big enough and simple enough that they<br/>\ncould move the cars around and do imagination play.  As they got older<br/>\nand were better able to engineer the rails to do what they wanted them<br/>\nto then she pulled out the huge (and ever growing) box of wooden<br/>\nrails.  The other thing that was nice about this is that it slid under<br/>\ntheir beds so it stored easily even if they left it scattered.  She<br/>\ncould easily just dump everything onto the plywood and slide it under<br/>\nthe bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there are &quot;rail design programs&quot; on the internet that tell<br/>\nyou how to build different configurations.  I haven&#39;t been to one in<br/>\nmany years, but remember finding them when Keon was wanting<br/>\n&quot;blueprints&quot; like his daddy&#39;s model railroads.  Sometimes though, you<br/>\ncan find unique ways to foster self confidence by helping them.  Help<br/>\nhim sort his rails into different sizes and shapes, show him how the<br/>\nsmall curves make tight circles and the large curves make big circles<br/>\nand how switching them around you can make S&#39;s or other squiggles.<br/>\nSee how long you can make a track through your house without going in<br/>\na circle (something that still gets done here and it surprises me how<br/>\nmany feet of track we actually own!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you may not have an interest in playing with trains your son<br/>\ndoes.  Get excited about his world.  Strew trains for him!  Find out<br/>\nfrom a local terminal or railyard when trains come through and couple<br/>\nand uncouple and see if you can arrange to go watch it (even if just<br/>\nfrom a safe distance).  Once, though, I took my son to a lumber yard<br/>\nthat had deliveries and the owner let us go and sit on one of the<br/>\ndelivery docks and watch the trains back up and uncouple.

Instead of seeing this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1055080202\">There are several things here that I would like to comment on.  <br/>\nFirst, you have labeled your son&#39;s reactions as a `negative <br/>\nattitude&#39;.  Instead of seeing this as an attitude problem it might <br/>\nbe more helpful to see his reaction as an attempt to communicate his <br/>\nneeds.  `Negative Attitude&#39; makes it sound like he is not trying his <br/>\nbest or is being lazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I question lumping together the help he needs when playing <br/>\nlegos etc. and the help he needs when putting a dish away.  It is <br/>\nunlikely that he is motivated in the same way when doing these two <br/>\nactivities.  Being asked or told to put a dish away is very <br/>\ndifferent than sitting down to some legos to play.  Perhaps each <br/>\nproblem should be addressed separately.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mind you, I was doing the rest and<br/>\nhe just was asked to do one plate, since he was standing there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your motive for asking your son to put away a dish? Was it <br/>\nreally because he was standing there?  Or, is it for some other <br/>\nreason?  Do you wish for him to participate in family chores?  Do <br/>\nyou think that putting away a dish will make him more independent?  <br/>\nMore confident?  Are you using this to get your five year old to <br/>\nrecognize just how hard it is being a mom/grown up?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you say to him right after he said it would take all day?  <br/>\nDid your words validate or invalidate his feelings?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly, can your son say, `No&#39;, without being made to feel <br/>\nguilty or ashamed?  If the putting the plate away comes piled with <br/>\nguilt/shame/lack of choice, then perhaps moving all those ucky <br/>\nfeelings along with it _does_ seem as if it will take all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would just feel fabulous if I could say no and my Mom made me feel <br/>\nthat it was ok.  Alternatively, I can imagine how much lighter the <br/>\ntask would be for me if I got help with the plate when asked to put <br/>\nit away.  If you and he work together, the plate may become a moment <br/>\nto share and not an object of struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I want to help him feel more confident and more<br/>\nindependent.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFive is so very young to put such heavy words on a little one such <br/>\nas confidence and independence. Hold him, play with him and drink in <br/>\nevery moment of him.  These things will give him the firm foundation <br/>\nto become confident and independent in his own time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how difficult it can be when a little one is frustrated with <br/>\nhis play things and wants you to be right at his side.  My son would <br/>\nspend hours lining up hot-wheels cars up in rows and demand that I <br/>\nbe present and want me to occasionally place a car myself.  There <br/>\nwas one car that was very difficult to tell its front from its back <br/>\nand I made the mistake of lining it up wrong one day.  My son cried <br/>\nfor an hour (or at least it seemed as long).  Those were trying <br/>\ndays, but I would never have wanted him to be more independent.  He <br/>\nneeded me right there for every car and every row.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa H","from":"&quot;Lisa H&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: negative attitude","postDate":"1156200982","msgId":16622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVY0QkQxMTJGQkEwNUQ0MTJGQ0M5MjlEMTQxMEBwaHguZ2JsPg=="},"prevInTopic":16616,"nextInTopic":16624,"prevInTime":16621,"nextInTime":16623,"topicId":16615,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The first thought that came to mind is why this is perceived as a negative attitude?

Maybe it&#39;s just not a clear communication of his desire.  Perhaps he doesn&#39;t want to put his dish in the dishwasher.  Is he allowed to say no?   As for the toys, wow, he&#39;s asking to engage with you.  He needs your assistance.  A time will come when he won&#39;t ask for your help.  The last thing i would want is to turn my daughter away from feeling comfortable asking me for help with anything.  It doesn&#39;t always mean i&#39;m always able to drop everything and help at that very moment but i wouldn&#39;t want her to not trust that i am available to her when she needs help.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I want to help him feel more confident and more independent. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think confidence comes from being respected.  If his request for help or his declining to help you is not respected he is being judged negatively.  Perhaps the negative attitude is not your 5yo sons at all &lt;g&gt;.  As for independence, is pushing someone towards something really independence? Is moving someone in a direction they are not ready or willing to do really independence?  Is behavior as a result of being manipulated really independence?   I think an unschooled child does become independent because they know what is it to be trusted and respected and valued.  Not manipulated, pushed or devalued.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is so young.  I would respond positively to him with a loving gentle voice.  Watch out for your expectations of what you think he should be doing or not doing.  He will surprise you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts a wonderful journey.<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263883708,"authorName":"camden","from":"&quot;camden&quot; &lt;ccoutlaw@...&gt;","profile":"ccoutlaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] negative attitude","postDate":"1156178828","msgId":16616,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNGEwMWM2YzU0MSRkYzk2ZTMyMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBuZXdsYXA+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwODIxMTQzMTI1LjEyMzgwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTExLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16615,"nextInTopic":16622,"prevInTime":16615,"nextInTime":16617,"topicId":16615,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*****I wanted to ask what you do about a negative attitude***** I have a 7yo who sounds just like your son.

I don&#39;t have an answer for your son but I know when Coty says its too hard, its usually just because he wants company. If the other kids have gone to bed and he wants a track made he makes the most amazing tracks all by himself, so I know he can do it by himself, he just doesn&#39;t want to be alone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCoty gets easily frustrated also, so I try & keep the frustrating activities to a minimum and if he wants to try something I think would be frustrating for him we try it together.  Could it be your son is not being negative but is frustrated or just doesn&#39;t think he has the ability to do the task (?) before him?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be possible to have an area where the tracks could be set up for a long period of time so he doesn&#39;t have to set them up everytime he wants to use them?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven at 7 I love the fact that Coty is so dependant on me ;)  My older kids are much more independant and I love having a little one ask me for help in his adventures.

Here&#39;s an example.  I was clearing the table after dinner and asked him to help by putting a plate in the dishwasher.  He says &quot;I can&#39;t do this alone, it will take all day.&quot; Mind you, I was doing the rest and he just was asked to do one plate, since he was standing there.   It is the same thing when he wants to build a train track for his Thomas Trains or Lincon logs, legos, imaginex.  He cannot do it, he needs help.  We have this come up several times every day.  I usually try to be around, but I ready don&#39;t want to play trains by myself and it is even too hard to do, even with me.  He is easily frustrated in many situations.  I want to help him feel more confident and more independent.  <br/>\n <br/>\n Amanda<br/>\n Eli 5 Samuel 3.5<br/>\n <br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nHow low will we go?
