I call that a daily order, some might call it structure.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI call it control. (well, maybe...I&#39;d need more information first)<br/>\nNow eating meals at predictable times might just be a natural rhythm <br/>\nin your family, but we&#39;ve found that we all get hungry at different <br/>\ntimes and have different needs for food intake. So there are <br/>\npredictable times that I&#39;m fixing food throughout the day, but we <br/>\nall might not be hungry at that moment. And someone is always <br/>\nneeding a snack when I&#39;m not fixing food, so I help them find <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\nWe have some predictability, yes. But it&#39;s not decided by the adults <br/>\nin the home. It&#39;s simply a natural flow of everyone getting their <br/>\nneeds met.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are set times that people are USUALLY tired around here, but <br/>\nit varies a lot. I don&#39;t decide a bedtime for anyone but myself. My <br/>\ntwo younger children go to bed when I do, so that&#39;s pretty <br/>\npredictable.<br/>\nI don&#39;t have an arbitrary time I put people to bed though. We sleep <br/>\nwhen we get tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older boys usually stay up later than anyone, but last night they <br/>\nwere asleep (with a friend spending the night) by 9:30pm!! Highly <br/>\nunusual. They had played paintball all day though, so they were <br/>\nexhausted. If I had a set bedtime, I guarantee you they&#39;d be staying <br/>\nup until that set time and ignoring the needs of their body.<br/>\nThey have no fascination with staying up late though, so going to <br/>\nbed early just made sense last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you find the list a useful place to question just how parents <br/>\nare able to give children these choices without having chaos in <br/>\ntheir homes, how unschooling unfolds better in these conditions and <br/>\nhow people arrived at these various places in their journey to <br/>\nunschooling.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5030,"nextTopicId":5039}}
