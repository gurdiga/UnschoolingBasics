It is not nice to<br/>\nhim either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s none of MiL&#39;s business. Tell her you promise not to make *her* <br/>\nfuture incontinence a topic of conversation--and that you will help her <br/>\nfind those adult diapers when she&#39;s ready. &lt;g&gt; But your sons&#39; issues <br/>\nare his alone, so she needs to step back.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I used to insist that he change, but we ended up<br/>\nin a battle of wills.  He is very intense and I think I probably am<br/>\nas well.  Since I&#39;ve been a part of this group, I&#39;ve let go of my<br/>\ninsistance that he change his wet pullup.  MIL means well, but she<br/>\nthinks I am nuts, I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, but she had her chance to rear her own children. Now it&#39;s YOUR <br/>\nturn.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all this talk about poopy/wet diapers has really got me thinking.<br/>\nAm I on the right track of letting him wear his pullups at night?<br/>\nThe doctor is not concerned and says that sometimes it takes some<br/>\nkids, esp. boys, longer to have bladder control in the night.  BTW,<br/>\nds still has accidents during the day periodically.  I&#39;m not sure if<br/>\nit is a bladder issue, or if it is that he is so involved in what he<br/>\nis doing and has such a hard time with transitions.  Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI distinctly remember when I was in fourth grade: I would *dream* that <br/>\nI was getting up and walking into the bathroom, sit on the <br/>\ntoilet,.......and then pee all over my bed. What&#39;s fourth grade? <br/>\nten/eleven years old??? I had just moved to Columbia and was having a <br/>\nreally hard transition with the move. My mother wavered between being <br/>\nvery understanding and LIVID that she had to wash sheets aGAIN. That <br/>\ndidn&#39;t help much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI so wish they had Pull-ups or Goodnights back then!<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron&#39;s friend, Noah, would bring his GoodNights over until I think <br/>\nhe was 12-ish. He was on meds that made it difficult for him to hold it <br/>\nin all night.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but I<br/>\nknew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a<br/>\nblood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was so<br/>\ndifferent.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very upset.<br/>\nThey held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had some<br/>\ninexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took<br/>\nseven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I was<br/>\nnot aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with unschooling<br/>\ntype of ideas.  I comforted her the best I could and cried along with<br/>\nher.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---now you know! Be a bitch! This is your CHILD and you have LOTS <br/>\nof rights and don&#39;t have to tolerate bad medicine!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, fast forward a couple of years and dd is feeling bad, sore<br/>\nthroat, etc., won&#39;t drink anything, and I have other options than<br/>\nforcing her to take medication or to drink water.  I get myself out<br/>\nin the rain to the store and buy everything I can think of to entice<br/>\nher to get fluids in her.  I got popsicles, ice cream, chocolate<br/>\nmilk, jello, pudding, chicken noodle soup, gatorade, sprite, etc.<br/>\nShe chose the popsicle and is now eating her second one.  I&#39;ve<br/>\noffered her medicine and told her that if she wanted it, it is<br/>\navailable.  So, am I on the right track here?  Since I am fairly new<br/>\nto the idea of unschooling and living life without coercion, I<br/>\nquestion what I am doing, and whether or not I am honoring my child.<br/>\nBut I still fear another hospital episode.  She is very small - 38<br/>\nlbs at nearly 9 years old.  I believe that is probably one reason she<br/>\ngets dyhdrated so quickly.

He also <br/>\nhad occasional daytime accident until he was probably 8. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow for sure what the primary cause was. I do think it went on as <br/>\nlong as it did because of issues with his bio dad. The reason I <br/>\nthink that is because he stopped wetting the bed initially around 7 <br/>\nafter his dad had been completely out of the picture for a couple of <br/>\nyears. When his dad re-entered his life but was very inconsistent <br/>\nand unreliable the bed-wetting started again. It almost always <br/>\nhappened right after contact with his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe eventually got an underwear alarm. It attaches to the underwear <br/>\nand beeps when it gets wet. It woke everyone up and then we could <br/>\nget ds to the bathroom. It wasn&#39;t used in any shameful or forcing <br/>\nway. It was offered to him and he wanted to try it. He was at the <br/>\nage that he was afraid to have sleepovers because he would be <br/>\nembarassed if he wet the bed. Anyway, after only 3 nights of that he <br/>\nstopped wetting the bed. I guess he learned how to recognize the <br/>\nurge to urinate while asleep and would get up and go on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the medicine, the medicines you mentioned are only for relief of <br/>\nsymptoms. They don&#39;t do anything to speed healing. They are not <br/>\nnecessary. So, if your children don&#39;t want to take them, I think <br/>\nthat&#39;s fine. I think you are on the right track with finding things <br/>\ntaht your dd will eat or drink to keep from getting dehydrated <br/>\nrather than forcing meds. <br/>\n<br/>\nChicken soup is a good way to get fluids. Saline nasal sprays and <br/>\nsalt water gargles are natural ways to relieve congestion and sore <br/>\nthroats. Hot/warm lemony and/or ginger and/or peppermint liquids are <br/>\ngood, too. I&#39;m sure there are other herbs and spices that could <br/>\nhelp.

Also I noticed the other day that Pampers is making a size 7 now - finally in reality that kids aren&#39;t done with diapers at 2 years of age when they get a chance to do it on their own schedule!  I can&#39;t believe the number of people, some total strangers, who feel it&#39;s their business to inform me that &#39;you really need to get those girls out of diapers!&#39;.  They are perfectly happy in their Dora pullups that they chose last time at Walmart :o).  And a stat I read recently is that the average age of kids moving out of diapers is 3 1/2, which means there are lots of kids older than 3 1/2 who are still in diapers.  Another example of really unhelpful comparing...&#39;behind&#39;...behind whom???  My sister wet the bed at night until she was 7, there was no bladder problem, and it stopped when she was ready.  I have a funny memory of this long lanky 6 year old laying down on the bed at night to get her<br/>\n diaper put on, and thank god my mom didn&#39;t make it a big deal.  So I love the sharing I&#39;ve read about just letting these kids *be* where they&#39;re at.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\nguideforthree &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:guideforthree@...\">guideforthree@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ****Am I on the right track of letting him wear his pullups at <br/>\nnight?

Talk about control freak. Ack!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease know that the laughter we share about this is directly due to the<br/>\nfact that I have long forgiven my parents for passing on to me and my<br/>\nsiblings what was done to them but I still have to work hard at not passing<br/>\nit on to my two daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 25 years old and out on a date with my boyfriend (we married 5<br/>\nyears later), my parents drove around looking for me and actually went to<br/>\nthe home of friends of mine (married with two boys), knocked on their door<br/>\nand demanded to know, &quot;Where&#39;s my daughter?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeavy sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to this list and also to unschooling but certainly not to free will<br/>\nchoice and non-interference in other&#39;s choices. I kept my dd Hannah who is 9<br/>\nout of public school until Grade 2 but was truly unaware of unschooling and<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t imagine homeschooling...the thought of creating school in my home<br/>\nmade me ill.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince finding radical unschooling...well...it&#39;s a perfect fit although I am<br/>\nstill peeling layers and changing behaviors. Whoa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am saddened by the damage that was done in school but do believe it is<br/>\nalready reversing itself quickly in the three weeks since I pulled her out<br/>\n-- at her request. There were so many signs of suffering and no one listened<br/>\nor rather I suppose no one could hear me. I suppose that was good too in the<br/>\nlong run as this is the BEST solution for us. I know that to the core of my<br/>\nbeing and so does she.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far it&#39;s been a wild, emotional and wondrous ride. Fraught with fresh<br/>\nemotions that I had felt I&#39;d worked through...New layers...woo hoo. grin<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is quite chaotic here but that&#39;s so great. Hannah has created a fort in<br/>\nour living room and claimed it as her bedroom now. She slept there one night<br/>\nbut was back in bed with me last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other daughter who is 11 and in Grade 6 chose to stay in school. I wince<br/>\nwhen she tells me she feels better when I tell her it&#39;s time to go to bed. I<br/>\ndo trust she will connect back with herself and her innate intelligence in<br/>\ndue time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see both my children not has little humans but as big spiritual beings who<br/>\nhave chosen me as their mother. Not all believe that and that&#39;s OK. Free to<br/>\nchoose what to believe too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut knowing they are not humans to mold or control helps me to remember to<br/>\ntreat them with dignity and respect and live in integrity with myself and my<br/>\nbeliefs in honoring free will in all beings. That is I believe how this<br/>\nentire creation turns...according to free will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also helped me to know I chose my parents and the experiences I<br/>\nencountered growing up. I know for certain it is NOT what I want for my<br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t expect I&#39;d write this much but Heather&#39;s comments about control<br/>\nreally touched me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 16, 2008 5:14 PM, swissarmy_wife &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heatherbean@...\">heatherbean@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Me too.

We&#39;ve always done the <br/>\nco-sleeping, but dh started insisting that the kids sleep in their <br/>\nown beds (he would always end up having to sleep on the couch or the <br/>\nfoot of the bed) so I helped the kids to gradually get used to their <br/>\nbeds.  I would lay down with them until they went to sleep.  I still <br/>\nsit between them and pat their backs until they go to sleep, or still <br/>\neven rock them with their long legs hanging over the sides of the <br/>\nchair! (we have the rocking chair in their bedroom right next to the <br/>\nbed) They take turns as to who gets to be rocked first.  Both like to <br/>\nbe next to someone when they sleep.  Usually, during the night, dd <br/>\ncomes and gets between my dh and me.  Then, along comes ds and I get <br/>\nout of bed and go back with him to their twin bed.

Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow about medicine.  It&#39;s interesting that this issue is being <br/>\ndiscussed right now because ds and dd are both sick with sore <br/>\nthroats, fever, congestion, etc.  In the past, I would have insisted <br/>\non them taking the yucky medicine (they do like the berry flavored <br/>\nibuprophen, though, but hate the purple medicine for congestion).  <br/>\nToday, dd would not drink anything or eat anything because her throat <br/>\nwas hurting so bad.  Some background here:<br/>\n<br/>\nDd has been hospitalized twice for dehydration.  The first time, I <br/>\ndid not realize it but she was close to dying.  She was limp and <br/>\nunresponsive when I took her to the doctor.  The doctor took one look <br/>\nat her and said to take her immediately to the hosptial (his office <br/>\nis right next to the hospital).  When we got there, we went straight <br/>\nto the pediatric ward and were met by several nurses who rushed dd <br/>\noff (with me in tow) to a room where they immediately put in an I.V.  <br/>\nDd did not really even respond while they did this.  Later, the doc <br/>\ntold me that she was close to dying.  Scared me.  She stayed in the <br/>\nhospital for two days, but with the fluids, she gained back strength <br/>\nand felt so much better. <br/>\n<br/>\n The next time she was hospitalzed, she was not that far gone, but I <br/>\nknew what to look for.  We took her to the doctor and they did a <br/>\nblood test and sent her to the hospital again.  This time, it was so <br/>\ndifferent.  When they tried to put in the i.v., dd was very upset.  <br/>\nThey held her down and caused her all sorts of trauma.  They had some <br/>\ninexperienced person who was training to try the i.v.  They took <br/>\nseven attempts to get it in!  I was furious, but at that time, I was <br/>\nnot aware of my rights as a parent or even familiar with unschooling <br/>\ntype of ideas.  I comforted her the best I could and cried along with <br/>\nher.  Boy, if I could do that over again .....<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, fast forward a couple of years and dd is feeling bad, sore <br/>\nthroat, etc., won&#39;t drink anything, and I have other options than <br/>\nforcing her to take medication or to drink water.  I get myself out <br/>\nin the rain to the store and buy everything I can think of to entice <br/>\nher to get fluids in her.  I got popsicles, ice cream, chocolate <br/>\nmilk, jello, pudding, chicken noodle soup, gatorade, sprite, etc.  <br/>\nShe chose the popsicle and is now eating her second one.  I&#39;ve <br/>\noffered her medicine and told her that if she wanted it, it is <br/>\navailable.  So, am I on the right track here?  Since I am fairly new <br/>\nto the idea of unschooling and living life without coercion, I <br/>\nquestion what I am doing, and whether or not I am honoring my child.  <br/>\nBut I still fear another hospital episode.  She is very small - 38 <br/>\nlbs at nearly 9 years old.  I believe that is probably one reason she <br/>\ngets dyhdrated so quickly.  What else can I do to help my daughter <br/>\nfeel better and honor her choices as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now my throat is sore, and I think I&#39;ll try one of those <br/>\npopsicles.  It does sound a whole lot better than that nasty throat <br/>\nspray!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all so much for your straightforwardness.  I really <br/>\nappreciate the posts here and am learning sooooooo much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30030,"nextTopicId":30038}}
