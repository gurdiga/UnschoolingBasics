It makes me sad sometimes when I look at Cimion and <br/>\nI know that his life could have been very different, had he been <br/>\ngiven even even half the respect and compassion Jacqueline has been <br/>\ngiven. Jacqueline is the same age now that Cimion was when they were <br/>\nremoved from their bio. home and she is also the same age that <br/>\nShawna was when we met them. To look at her, at this age  and to <br/>\nthink back to where Cimion & Shawna&#39;s life was at the same age, is <br/>\nlike night and day. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I know....the more I trust my girls and give them freedom <br/>\nover their choices...the more they thrive, blossom, sparkle, grow, <br/>\nlove, trust and learn. It&#39;s am amazing process to watch. I feel very <br/>\nlucky to be part of it. We&#39;re enjoying the journey very much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, Jacqueline was playing barbies.
