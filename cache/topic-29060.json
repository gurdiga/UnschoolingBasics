Anyway, sounds like a day at my house!!  If DH refers to husband then he usually is good at &quot;words of affirmation&quot;, to me regarding my parenting and lets me know that I am doing a great job.  He realizes this isn&#39;t an easy task 24/7.  He will go and have a talk with them and give me some time to breath.  My kids are older 9, 8, 6, and 20 mo.  We tend to have to revisit the same issues daily.  As long as you and your wife are on the same page with parenting, disciplining issues, and the like, and be consistent with follow through on things then hopefully you will be gracious to her if she phones you during the day for encouragement or to vent to you.  That always helps in my situation.    <br/>\nYou need communication and compassion between each other, and turn your family into the &quot;Saxon Team&quot;.  Have a family meeting  and discuss the &quot;team motto&quot; and what team work means.  Let your kids see they are part of the family, their importance to the team, &quot;The Saxon Team&quot;, and your family.  This helps them to see again their value and position they hold thus, they will hopefully be more likely to &quot;follow the rules&quot;, respect the &#39;team leaders&quot;, DH, DW, and have more responsibilities especially during those times  when DW needs to have one on one time with another team member.  Give rewards where needed, not bribery or they will expect it in order to get what YOU want.  You can even make a tee-shirt with your own family team name on it, a wall mounted Team motto and what you stand for.  Something tangible to see to remind you you are all part of this endeavor together in the good and bad.  Positive words of affirmation to the hurting one is key, and offering to help by &quot;their&quot; direction is also key.  Don&#39;t try to &quot;fix it&quot;, DW just wants you to listen #1, and then go on her lead as to what you can do to help.  Yelling, getting angry are no no&#39;s.  Work together to solve the issue.  It also works both ways if the shoe happens to be on the other foot.  Just be careful not to condemn the caregiver and unload about the day you have had, know what I mean?  It only makes it worse.<br/>\n    <br/>\n We try this as well, it works if there is consistancy,<br/>\n        <br/>\nbest to you<br/>\n Alita<br/>\n    <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Robert Saxon&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TheSaxons@...\">TheSaxons@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 27, 2008 1:33 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] What kind of support from DH?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  RU Ladies,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I need your perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is our scenario: DW has been working all day to stay connected with<br/>\n  dd2 (4.75), who is hitting her sister, throwing things, and spitting in DW&#39;s<br/>\n  face. Add to this at dinner, DW&#39;s mom comes over and talks to us about kids<br/>\n  needing to respect their parents. Enter frustration, anger, and<br/>\n  discouragement. And this kind of stuff has been happening a bit more often<br/>\n  than we&#39;d like (esp. the &quot;concerned mother&quot; bit). Understandably, DW is<br/>\n  about to strangle someone or something at the end of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So here&#39;s my question. If this were you, what things could your DH do to<br/>\n  help encourage you? What could he do to really help you feel good about the<br/>\n  decision to parent the way you do?

A couple things to throw on<br/>\nthe table once you get to the &quot;okay, how do WE deal with this?&quot; (the We<br/>\npart is important)<br/>\n- let &quot;Mom&quot; know that she&#39;s welcome to come over for dinner on Thursdays<br/>\n(or Mondays and Wednesdays or whatever you choose) but that you&#39;d like<br/>\nto have dinners be just family times the rest of the week (maybe even<br/>\nquote all those &quot;the family who eats dinner together...&quot; public service<br/>\ncommercials. That you appreciate her concern but what would really help<br/>\nmost is for you and DW to have some uninterrupted time with the girls.<br/>\n- give your DW some space regularly to have a soak int he tub or<br/>\nwhatever she finds refreshing - maybe even something like a<br/>\nstitch&#39;n&#39;bitch group at the local Starbucks or a yoga class at the<br/>\ncommunity center. Whatever it is that helps her feel refreshed and<br/>\nrenewed and re-centered.<br/>\n- do a bit of an &quot;autonomy&quot; inventory regarding your little one. That<br/>\nage can be particularly rough in general and particularly if the child<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel heard or allowed to be more autonomous. Things like being<br/>\nable to get her own juice, snacks, etc may seem like small things but go<br/>\na long way toward getting through this age. Include in the discussion<br/>\nthings like when is the negative behavior (hitting, throwing, spitting)<br/>\nmost likely to occur - tired? hungry? hurried? etc I know that if I try<br/>\nto hurry DS, he can dig in and find any number of ways to make things<br/>\n&quot;difficult&quot; because he&#39;s feeling pressured. Or, if we overstay someplace<br/>\nthat he&#39;s reluctant to be in the first place - for instance, FIL has<br/>\nbeen hospitalized for the last two months and, while DH goes to visit on<br/>\nhis own, there are times when he&#39;d like to have me with him - which<br/>\nmeans bringing DS along as well. If we stay at the hospital more than<br/>\nabout an hour, despite a bag full of things (handheld videogames, puzzle<br/>\nbooks, snacks, sketchpad, etc - all things DS chooses to bring), DS gets<br/>\nmore and more in my face (and DH&#39;s - and I mean literally as in putting<br/>\nhis hands over my eyes or poking my neck with his finger repeatedly) to<br/>\nmake it clear &quot;We need to leave&quot; rather than simply saying &quot;Can we<br/>\nleave?&quot; he expresses his frustration physically. [PS yes, we have cut<br/>\nback the number of times and duration that DS is at the hospital and<br/>\nwe&#39;re trying to figure out some sort of child care arrangement - but<br/>\nthis is going to be long term, possibly for the rest of FIL&#39;s life, that<br/>\nhe&#39;ll be in some sort of caregiving institution so there&#39;s a bit of<br/>\ncomplication there]<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Sometimes if my DH has a doubt I just try to put him in the kids shoe so he can see with their little eyes.<br/>\n  Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] What kind of support from DH?","postDate":"1201437696","msgId":29068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDgwMTI3MTI0MS5tMFJDZmlsYjAxMDc2OUBvbXIzLm5ldHdvcmtzb2x1dGlvbnNlbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDgwMTI3MTIyMC5tMFJDS0lYbTAwMDQ0NEBvbXIxNC5uZXR3b3Jrc29sdXRpb25zZW1haWwuY28gbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDgwMTI3MDAzM3AyZjUxNmY0MnIyMTdhMDE4NTkwMGVmNmUwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8MjAwODAxMjcxMjIwLm0wUkNLSVhtMDAwNDQ0QG9tcjE0Lm5ldHdvcmtzb2x1dGlvbnNlbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29066,"nextInTopic":29071,"prevInTime":29067,"nextInTime":29069,"topicId":29060,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Do you have any brothers?  (Just kidding!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRob, the thing that I have always needed and craved most of all from <br/>\nmy husband when things were going rough for me has been simply his <br/>\nloving support in the form of empathic, reflexive listening.  He <br/>\ntends to want to fix things and tell me what I should do, but unless <br/>\nI&#39;ve specifically asked what he thinks I should do, I don&#39;t want or <br/>\nneed someone fixing my life.  *I* can fix my life.  What I need is <br/>\nsomeone who loves me, who hears that I&#39;m in pain, and holds a loving <br/>\nspace for me to get through my rough feelings.  He&#39;ll listen, and the <br/>\nfeedback I most want is, &quot;Wow! That sounds really hard!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter she&#39;s gotten through the roughest of her feelings, you might <br/>\nalso *offer* to brainstorm ideas with her for dealing with her mom <br/>\nand ways your wife can hold it together while your daughter is going <br/>\nthrough *her* rough patches.  Does your wife post here?  (That could <br/>\nbe one of the ideas.)  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that you probably already do this, but picking up some <br/>\nof her responsibilities would probably also help tremendously (i.e., <br/>\ngetting dinner together or hanging with the kids while your wife goes <br/>\noff and replenishes herself).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps a little.
