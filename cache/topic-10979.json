Whenever I see someone else with dreads, they just fascinate me.  But they smell like dirty hair, which I just can&#39;t tolerate in close spaces, like my car, so it would be really challenging for my kids to have smelly hair and go anywhere with me.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I do suggest shampoo when my children&#39;s hair smells too dirty, because the smell genuinely is a problem for me -- it&#39;s so distracting in the car I can&#39;t concentrate on anything else and it makes me grumpy that I feel ill just because someone else didn&#39;t wash his hair.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

When <br/>\nmost of Jossilyn&#39;s(then 8) hair fell out after chemo it made her <br/>\nlook like a sick little old man.  It was thin and wispy and almost <br/>\nwhite.

But it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nvery permanent, probably due to the chemo. The Kool-Aid would have <br/>\nbeen much cheaper.  We ended up doing it twice between June and <br/>\nAugust.  Then in August before we went to Boston for her BMT (bone <br/>\nmarrow transplant) we tried blue instead  (it didn&#39;t suit her as <br/>\nwell.)

We had the exact same &quot;test&quot;. Last night at<br/>\n11 my 15 yo (Deven) told my 5 yo (Jake) to go get the scissors and cut<br/>\nhis hair. All these horrible thoughts of ears being cut off flashed through<br/>\nmy mind but I bit my tongue. After a few min. of discussing hair styles,<br/>\nDeven looked at me and asked if I would fix it. His face was priceless, a<br/>\nlittle scared and a touch defiant. I told him I would in the morning but by<br/>\nthen he realized what could happen. My DH stepped in and told him he would<br/>\ncut it for him, so at midnight my DH gave both boys a haircut. I was<br/>\nsuprised by this way of &quot;testing&quot; until I got up this a.m. and read your<br/>\nmessage.  Do alot of boys test this way? For the week that we&#39;ve been<br/>\nunschooling, I&#39;ve had more fun that the past 7 yrs of homeschooling.<br/>\nCharlene in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232225755,"authorName":"jsnhawkins","from":"&quot;jsnhawkins&quot; &lt;jsnhawkins@...&gt;","profile":"jsnhawkins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"officially deschooling and &quot;the test&quot;","postDate":"1143034149","msgId":10979,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR2cmpmNSt2OGM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10980,"prevInTime":10978,"nextInTime":10980,"topicId":10979,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I finally convinced DH to go along with letting me pull DS (10) from school now instead of waiting till the school year is over.

Now<br/>\nwe&#39;re officially deschooling and taking a well-deserved vacation from<br/>\nanything remotely academic. I&#39;m so thrilled!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, you may remember me posting about how to stop micromanaging<br/>\neverything. It&#39;s been going great. I&#39;ve have backed WAY off and DS&#39;s<br/>\nattitude is already improving. I told him that I was going to refrain<br/>\nfrom making decisions for him unless it was a safety issue of<br/>\nimperative  for some unusual reason. He didn&#39;t believe me. So a few<br/>\ndays later he decided he was going to cut his hair by himself. I<br/>\nlooked at him funny but said &quot;whatever you wanna do&quot;. He proceded to<br/>\ncut a chunk of hair out, spazzed out for a second after realizing what<br/>\nhe had done, and then told me he was &quot;just testing me&quot; to see if I&#39;d<br/>\ntell him he couldn&#39;t. That absolutely cracked me up. I guess he trusts<br/>\nme now. Afterwards I gave him a new haircut (per his request) with<br/>\nbuzzed sides so that you can&#39;t see the missing chunk. So, on with our<br/>\nunschooling adventure. Thanks for the advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10986,"nextTopicId":11010}}
