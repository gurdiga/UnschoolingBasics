That&#39;s Part of what it is to be a young teen, swamped with hormones and all that goes with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe very idea that you have feelings is probably enough to make her feel overwhelmed - OMG, I have to deal with YOUR feelings TOO? Blaaaaaahhhhhhhh! <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s incredibly needy right now, but part of the problem is she doesn&#39;t know what she needs. She has entirely new sensations moving through her body and mind, and that&#39;s baffling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems that no matter what I say or do she sees it as controlling her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Remember the toddler who wanted to pour her own juice even though she made a mess every time? Did any of your kids do that? Or the baby who was sure she could walk down a flight of stairs and why are you picking me up, mom? I can do this. Its the same thing, but bigger, newer and scarier bc she has more skills and information, now. She&#39;s wanting to do more of Everything her own way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I asked if she was ready. She whined a bit. I asked<br/>\n&gt; her did she want to go or not. We could table it for sometime next week. No<br/>\n&gt; she needed socks (I can&#39;t pick them out) and she needed to get them. So she<br/>\n&gt; went but with a begrudging attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She wants to buy socks but doesn&#39;t want to go to the store and doesn&#39;t want you to pick them out. Gosh do I know That feeling! The difference is that I&#39;ve had twenty five more years to figure out how to deal with that internal conflict than she has - I wasn&#39;t exactly graceful about it at 13, lemme tell ya! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I asked her<br/>\n&gt; what I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get<br/>\n&gt; experiences that she wanted even in this society. She shut down. I didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know why and I asked her what was up. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It might help you to catch yourself when you see her as &quot;shutting down&quot;. She&#39;s developing more internal skills, and dealing with big new feelings, so turning her attention inward may be a really important activity for her. She needs time and space to process, and she may not be able to do that while talking - I can&#39;t process while talking or while someone else is talking! I have to go away and think and then come back to something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I asked her what was up she told me that I was complaining about her and<br/>\n&gt; telling her what is wrong with her. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Instead of arguing, try to hear the feelings behind the words. She took your comment critically. That&#39;s not about you, its about her, her uncertain emotions right now, but its something you can respond to by being more careful of your words. Wait more before saying or asking Anything, even for clarification. Assume there&#39;s a whole Pile of processing going on while you wait, and that&#39;s all about her right now. Its not something you can, necessarily help with.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;On the way home she told me that she wished I would be a different<br/>\n&gt; parent and why couldn&#39;t I just punish her and not talk. It is really<br/>\n&gt; frustrating because she says this alot.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Personally, when someone is trying to talk, to get me to talk, and I want to think about something I feel like I&#39;m drowing in a sea of words! I get so overwhelmed I can&#39;t hear what the other person is saying. Being required to isolate myself would seem like sheer heaven in that kind of situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s true of your dd, then No Wonder she&#39;s saying she&#39;d rather be punished! She&#39;s lost the moment you start trying to help! Poor kid! Poor helpful mom! You&#39;re using the wrong strategy. Its NOT you, or her, its that you&#39;re using a communicaiton style that&#39;s utterly ineffective under these circumstances. The good news is that you can change that. You can learn to talk less and listen more, to give your dd the space she needs to think. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just feel like she could have said...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She had conflicting urges, was feeling overwhelmed. In that kind of situation, I often can&#39;t &quot;just&quot; say anything. Saying anything is an enormous effort involving finding words to fit feelings and Then finding words that aren&#39;t &quot;Leave me the F*** alone (but not too alone, can you maybe just hide outside the door and cough occasionally so I know you still love me?)!!!!&quot; Even with two decades more practice than your dd has, I still usually get stuck trying to find the nicer, more coherent, less whiney, way of expressing that, and tend to shut down. Happily, I have a partner who understands all this and knows what &quot;Grrr... not now&quot; really means!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo step back, please, and see that her process is very very different from yours right now. Talking is the last thing she can do. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a thought - she likes to write? Can you start a project of writing back and forth to each other? It doesn&#39;t matter what, I don&#39;t think, at first, just see it as a way to start another kind of dialog, one where she has alllll the time and space she needs to clarify her own thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: adolescents","postDate":"1258224362","msgId":42049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhkbXR0YStobjI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2NzUwMi4xMjE5MS5xbUB3ZWI2MzQwMS5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42048,"nextInTopic":42050,"prevInTime":42048,"nextInTime":42050,"topicId":42041,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

On a long car trip my grandmother would pay me a quarter for 15 minutes of silence. Those were hard 15 minutes and quickly quarters became not worth it. My talking is a non-issue when things are good. But when things are bad, my desire to discuss, at great length, whatever is going on is not helpful. It doesn&#39;t change anything. It doesn&#39;t improve anything. It just adds words to hurting and sensitive ears who hear me as being critical or harsh. I don&#39;t want to do that. So I&#39;ve learned to be quieter. I&#39;ve learned that not everything needs to be discussed. <br/>\n <br/>\nAbout the socks. If it were me and Linnaea wanted to go get socks I&#39;d offer to take her. If she was too busy in that moment to go I&#39;d say I can take you but we have to go by whenever or we&#39;ll have to do it another day. And that would be it. My offering is a gift. What she does with that gift is her deal. If she came to me too late to get them I wouldn&#39;t be snippy or grouchy, I&#39;d be honestly sympathetic and talk about going on Saturday (even with the crowds) or ordering them on-line or knitting a pair or whatever. <br/>\n <br/>\nAbout the grounding. I wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;d go upstairs and say I don&#39;t want to ground you. I don&#39;t want to have grounding be part of my parenting toolbox. I&#39;d free her and offer to go get socks now or whenever was good for the both of us and I&#39;d let it go. <br/>\n <br/>\nTalk less and listen more. Don&#39;t worry about something not happening again. It&#39;ll happen again even if you can verbally peg down why it happened. Things happen. Lightening strikes the same place many times. Be willing to bend and not break or snap back. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to have things not be controllable, but people are often not controllable. <br/>\n <br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":309081207,"authorName":"Beth Williams","from":"Beth Williams &lt;beth.s.williams@...&gt;","profile":"mongoosewilliams","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: adolescents","postDate":"1258163720","msgId":42047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmN2YzYTczMDkxMTEzMTc1NW0zNjM0NmExb2M0OTI2OTI2NzE2NDI5YjFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU2MTE1OS4xMTMzOS5xbUB3ZWIxMTMyMDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhka3FlYStqNTQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTYxMTU5LjExMzM5LnFtQHdlYjExMzIwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42046,"nextInTopic":42048,"prevInTime":42046,"nextInTime":42048,"topicId":42041,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for this thread Faith.

Well, you can&#39;t force her to talk any more than you can force her to learn! She *will* talk to you, and you *will* have opportunities to share your opinions and hopes, etc., and you *will* continue to have moments of amazing connection and communication. But it&#39;s going to happen more and more on her schedule, at her whim even--some of my deepest, warmest conversations with MJ now come out of the blue, just &#39;cause she&#39;s in the mood to talk. And if there are situations that come up that I want to discuss, the discussion is always made better by delaying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate the sentiments behind this: &quot;I asked her what I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get experiences that she wanted even in this society.&quot; Just keep in mind that you can *offer* help without asking a question.

 i doubt it! :)  maybe i am misunderstanding the grounding thing...<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat has really helped the communication with my daughter is me backing way way off whenever there is any hint of her putting up a wall.  and then, after a little space - reaching out with NO reference to the previous wall. finding ways to connect, to relax, to enjoy each other&#39;s company.  and one of the ways in which she&#39;s shown her need for &quot;something new&quot; in terms of her own control over her life, etc., is to come to ME if she needs my help with  plans, as opposed to me trying to organize it for her.  so, if she  needed socks, and i knew she wanted to pick them out, i&#39;d way til she asked me to set up a time to go get them, rather than pushing or encouraging her to do something on  a schedule that seh clearly wasn&#39;t happy with.<br/>\n<br/>\ni am not clear what part of the discussion about her need for more freedom and  independence your daughter was perceiving as criticism - do you have clarity on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nalso have you read &quot;parent-teen breakthrough: the relationship approach&quot;?

She has<br/>\nalways been unschooled and we live in a family that respects the needs and<br/>\nwants of everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that no matter what I say or do she sees it as controlling her. I<br/>\ntry to be gentle and respectful and she talks and acts like I am punishing<br/>\nher. If I say anything about my feelings, concerns, etc she shuts down. She<br/>\nrefuses to acknowledge anything that isn&#39;t about her. It feels like she has<br/>\nbecome tyrannical and controls the family. Its like she has decided that she<br/>\ncan&#39;t be uncomfortable or unhappy without it being someones fault, usually<br/>\nme or her younger brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I asked her if she wanted to buy some socks. She had said that she<br/>\nneeded some. We had money. She said, &quot;Cant&#39; we go another day?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Well It&#39;s Friday so this weekend with be mobbed.&quot; (the stores are<br/>\ngetting crowded with holiday shoppers already and I have a panic disorder).<br/>\nAlso she has recently started school at her request, so during the week she<br/>\nis too tired to do anything more than school. Today was a day off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we came up with the solution that she would go for a walk and then have a<br/>\nbit to space out and play video games. Then we would go get socks. The time<br/>\ncame to go get socks. I asked if she was ready. She whined a bit. I asked<br/>\nher did she want to go or not. We could table it for sometime next week. No<br/>\nshe needed socks (I can&#39;t pick them out) and she needed to get them. So she<br/>\nwent but with a begrudging attitude. I centered myself and got ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the car we were chatting about things. Her brother wants to try school<br/>\nbecause she likes it so much. It was nice. I am not sure how it came to it<br/>\nbut we were talking about how she is really ready to live her own live but<br/>\nthat society doesn&#39;t work that way and its frustrating for her. I asked her<br/>\nwhat I could do to help make her life more her own. To help her get<br/>\nexperiences that she wanted even in this society. She shut down. I didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow why and I asked her what was up. She got really grumpy and pissy. When<br/>\nI asked her what was up she told me that I was complaining about her and<br/>\ntelling her what is wrong with her. I tried to explain that I wasn&#39;t, and<br/>\nreiterated what I was saying. She just got more distance and angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe told me that she didn&#39;t even want to go shopping and wanted me to just<br/>\nstopped talking. SO I didn&#39;t shut up and started getting really panicky and<br/>\nfrustrated. I pulled it together and centered myself. So we went home. No<br/>\nsocks. On the way home she told me that she wished I would be a different<br/>\nparent and why couldn&#39;t I just punish her and not talk. It is really<br/>\nfrustrating because she says this alot.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike if she does something I don&#39;t like (like leave the house without<br/>\ntelling me and I have no idea where she is, I feel scared) I will talk to<br/>\nher about it. I want to figure out how it wont happen again. She just wants<br/>\nme to ground her and it be over.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s where we are right now. She is &quot;grounded&quot;. She is in her room<br/>\ncleaning it. She has to come home from school and straight home each night<br/>\nfor a week. She said she prefeers this to &quot;Talking&quot;. I feel manipulated. I<br/>\nhave never punished any of my kids! And I don&#39;t want to but feel like I have<br/>\nrun out of options with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nA) she didn&#39;t want to go shopping and &quot;kicked and screamed&quot; til we didn&#39;t go<br/>\nB) she didn&#39;t want to take responsibility for her actions so she refused to<br/>\ntalk<br/>\nC) she wanted to explore being grounded so she set up a scenario to be<br/>\ngrounded.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just feel like she could have said that she didn&#39;t really want to go and<br/>\nwork out an alternative time. I feel like she could have respectfully ask to<br/>\ntable the conversation if she was too tired or whatever. I feel like if she<br/>\nwanted the experience of anything she could get it without manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am just feeling at wits end with her. She has become more and more selfish<br/>\nand controlling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help with a perspective change and any useful suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42036,"nextTopicId":42064}}
