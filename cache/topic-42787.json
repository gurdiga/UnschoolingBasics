To the boys, and myself, and probably anyone within earshot.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of really hearing the boys, I am coming up with arguments and exceptions and rebuffs to what they say. It&#39;s like I am looking to find some way that they are wrong about what they&#39;re saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sure as heck hope I haven&#39;t *always* been this way, and it&#39;s just now in my awareness. I don&#39;t think I have been!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know where this is coming from, this need to be right and prove wrongness. Even for simple things - Seth said he wished they&#39;d make a sequel to &quot;Bee Movie&quot; and rather than *hearing* him, I was like, &quot;Why?!&quot; and listed all the ways I didn&#39;t like Bee Movie, said that&#39;s NOT how flowers work, etc. I mean, WTH?! Even if I didn&#39;t like the movie, I could have just enjoyed his enthusiasm and idea for a sequel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know I&#39;ve been in kind of a down space lately, and a previously painful hidden childhood memory surfaced recently. Wondering if it&#39;s the little kid part of myself, needing to be right, to be heard. This was going on before that, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in the past, if I&#39;ve written stuff out, even if I didn&#39;t send it, it helped resolve it. Figured I&#39;d try it for this!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m present, I remember to breathe and smile before I speak - that usually nips any negativity I want to spew in the bud! And I know from experience that bringing it to my own awareness will help me make changes to stop it - I&#39;ll catch it earlier, I&#39;ll catch it BEFORE I say anything, then I won&#39;t need to say anything at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else dealt with this, seen this in themselves?<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nand thanks,<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42807,"nextTopicId":42738}}
