That was back in 1975.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe came from an orphanage, where he says he was beat,<br/>\nand the rats bit him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince he became a part of our family, he hasn&#39;t seen<br/>\nany councelors, or shown any bad behavior or anything.<br/>\n I know this is probably a little different from your<br/>\nsituation, but I thought it might help to know of<br/>\nother people&#39;s stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am proud to say that he graduated high school and<br/>\ncollege, and has been proudly serving in the Army, for<br/>\nat least 17 years.  He has raised a beautiful family,<br/>\nand is currently waiting to be sent abroad again.  He<br/>\nhas been in Afghanistan, during the war, and has come<br/>\nhome safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your little boy with be just fine.  We are<br/>\nwhite, and he is Korean.  There is a difference in<br/>\nskin color only.  I think the biggest thing a child<br/>\nneeds is a lot of love and understanding.  There are<br/>\nchildren out there that have had it worse than my<br/>\nlittle brother.  He was abandoned at a train station. <br/>\nSo he has had to deal with the feeling of not being<br/>\nwanted, but he is definately loved alot by all of us<br/>\nin our family.  I hope this helps in some way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and I hope all turns out well for you. <br/>\nSometimes just one horrible thing that has happened to<br/>\na child can scare everyone.  I think it depends on the<br/>\nsituation, and how the child is raised.  <br/>\n--- Elenita Santaballa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:esantaballa@...\">esantaballa@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all.

Our 12 yr. old is developmentally challenged,  bipolar <br/>\nand has reactional attachment disorder. It is a constant struggle with  him. <br/>\nWe were the 13th home he was placed in. He may never completely trust  anyone. <br/>\nOur 10 yr. old we have had since she was 5 is just now starting to feel  <br/>\nreally safe. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy youngest two were adopted as infants. They are very attached to us and  <br/>\nthough the 8 year old knows he&#39;s adopted, he is so attached to us. He recently  <br/>\nmet his birth parents and didn&#39;t really want to have much to do with them. The <br/>\n youngest is 2.5 and she is a mommas girl. I have co-slept with both of them, <br/>\n practiced complete AP parenting and I do not foresee any major problems.<br/>\n <br/>\nCongratulations on your adoption.
