Horrors! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 13 and enjoying the heck out of his life. Good for him!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen does he do other things? When he wants to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when he wants to go to Tae Kwon Do -- he gets up and gets himself in gear to go. He&#39;s a black belt getting ready for a tournament right now. He goes 2-3 times a week for a couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to know more about getting into that code that controls the games? hmmm. . . He takes himself online and finds something that is helping him figure it out. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe wants to join us on an outing? He gets up and comes along. He doesn&#39;t want to, he doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much freedom? Too out of step? Not for us. Not for him. He&#39;s doing just fine. Smart and happy and way too tall but a pleasure to talk to about news and politics and, if you can follow along, what he&#39;s up to in his game (he plays Halo 2).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I have to go buy some locks. A variety of locks. Because he saw something online and wants to really see how the mechanisms work. Really see for himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Because.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s good enough for me. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy unschooling to all! <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1731,"nextTopicId":20266}}
