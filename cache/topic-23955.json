That has <br/>\nworked for my frustrated children.  Rather than focusing on the rage or <br/>\nlabeling your children raging kids, figure out why they&#39;re frustrated enough to <br/>\nthrow the crayons, hit others or whatever it is that you&#39;re calling rage.  <br/>\n <br/>\nFor those who send their kids to their rooms (or ask their kids who have been <br/>\ntrained to excuse themselves when they lose control), or put them in time out <br/>\ndo you follow up after they&#39;ve calmed themselves?  Do you help figure out <br/>\nwhat their unmet needs were that sent them into the rage? If you train yourself <br/>\nto look for signs and cues before the child becomes enraged you can avoid the <br/>\nrages and meet the needs before things get thrown or anyone gets hit.  I&#39;m not <br/>\ntalking about hypoglycemia, hormones, terrible twos or other excuses people <br/>\noffer up on behalf of their frustrated kids; I&#39;m talking about not being heard <br/>\nby the one person who the kid expects to hear them -- their Mommy.  I&#39;m talking <br/>\nabout the gumball that big brother got from the neighbor but that 2 year old <br/>\nTommy missed out on and he is MAD about the unfairness of it so he&#39;s hitting <br/>\nhis brother, his mother and the dog.  I&#39;m talking about the teenager who really <br/>\nwanted to wear the spaghetti strap shirt but the mom refused to let her <br/>\nbecause she felt it was inappropriate and the teen has shut herself in her room and <br/>\nis swearing at her mother and mad at the world over the shirt.  Mainstream <br/>\nparents might address the swearing and the rage, bring Dad in to discuss <br/>\nparental respect and other BS but ignore the cause.  Mindful parents find a solution <br/>\nwhether it be to go shopping for a shirt they both agree is perfect to wear or <br/>\ndiscuss why the mother feels spaghetti straps make the child look cheap and <br/>\ndiscuss the mother&#39;s feelings of insecurity about people thinking she&#39;s not <br/>\ndoing a good job because she allows her daughter to dress that way.  The part of <br/>\nthis that makes people so uncomfortable is the self exploration that goes <br/>\nalong with being mindful.  It&#39;s A LOT easier to blame hormones or food allergies <br/>\nthan it is to change ourselves, our expectations and our reactions.  My <br/>\nfavorite label is the *fussy* or *colicky* baby.  The baby clearly has needs that are <br/>\nnot being met, whether its movement or feeding or whatever the cause, people <br/>\n(doctors included) label the baby as colicky and therefore give him the excuse <br/>\nto be crying all the time.  People bounce, rock, feed, drive around and do <br/>\nanything and everything to get the baby to stop crying.  That&#39;s what we need to <br/>\ndo with teenagers, too. You don&#39;t have to try everything with teens though <br/>\nbecause they can express themselves orally and usually discuss their problems.  <br/>\nSometimes we have to help them figure it out and find solutions together and be <br/>\nreally creative like when they were crying babies.  The ultimate goal being <br/>\nto help them stop crying/raging by meeting their needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nLastly, we&#39;re all hormonal beings throughout our lives so forget about it and <br/>\nget on with it!  Its no excuse to mistreat people or to be mistreated.  <br/>\nSometimes people just need to vent, too.  Why is it okay in our society for adults <br/>\nto become enraged but kids and teens earn negative labels for doing the same?  <br/>\nSometimes events (like war) and people (who do stupid stuff) enrage me, and <br/>\nmy husband *tries* to help me find solutions to end my rage.  Sometimes he just <br/>\nreminds me to breathe.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeacefully,<br/>\nRobin in Cape Cod, MA, enjoying a house full of hormonal people ages 3 - 43.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23958,"nextTopicId":23914}}
