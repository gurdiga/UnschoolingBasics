It has been just what I needed to hear.  <br/>\nI haev done lots of reading - all the books you all mentioned (well <br/>\nmost of them) I read years ago... I have even put up some of that <br/>\nstuff on my conscious parenting website... <br/>\n<br/>\nwww.labouroflove.org <br/>\n<br/>\n...funnily enough, I remember when I did the education section fo it <br/>\nwhen Dan was still in school, I used to joke to people that it was <br/>\nprobably some hidden prophesy that I never did add anything to the <br/>\nSteiner/Waldorf section, and that the only thing that had anything <br/>\nin it was the homeschooling section! I think I have some Gatto <br/>\narticles & stuff liek that. So, I have been in tune with all that <br/>\nstuff for a while.  I guess with Flynns birth I kind of went to <br/>\nsleep again, allwrapped up in baby stuff. I needed to awaken again <br/>\nto my first born son.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat &quot;woke me up&quot; again was reading Grace Lewellyns stuff - <br/>\nreading :&quot;11 teenagers who donlt go to school&quot; at the beginning of <br/>\nlast year. I thought to myself &quot;what the $@%# am I doing to my <br/>\nson!!!&quot; and anyway, he was out 6 months later. I will never forget <br/>\nhim running to me on his last day of school saying &quot;I&#39;m free!!!&quot; <br/>\nmakes me tearful to remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t remember who talked about Runescape, but Daniel is absoutely <br/>\nmad on it, has been for the past 3 - 4 months!  I&#39;ll find out his <br/>\nusername, and pass your kids ones onto him!!  Thanks for helping me <br/>\nto see the educational value in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that after having spent years in teh Waldorf system, I have <br/>\nalot of stuff to shake off around rules, and whats appropriate or <br/>\nnot. I relaxed so much from where I was 7 or 8 years ago when I was <br/>\na bit of a pain in the ass purist, but I know that &quot;role&quot; still <br/>\nlives in me!<br/>\n<br/>\nHey - thanks again everyone for such an awesome welcome, such <br/>\nheartfelt and useful replies. I will be contacting some of you <br/>\ndirectly on some of teh more specific issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith love & appreciation<br/>\nHilary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4905,"nextTopicId":4864}}
