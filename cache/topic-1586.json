Yes, IF such a thing came about.  My kids wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell me if they didn&#39;t want to show animals anymore.  In fact, my oldest son did.  He went about a year without showing animals and then came back and said he wanted to again, so he is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are on a schedule due to the realities of our lives, not some arbitrary belief that sleeping past 8 is a mortal sin.  It is how we figured things out when we decided to add activities to our lives, things we considered and talked about when trying to figure out how to let everyone do the things they want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do prefer that we are on a schedule, I like it this way.  But I certainly don&#39;t force it on the kids. If the kids would rather sleep in than do their activities or be able to help me think of way they could still do their activities and sleep in, I would do what they wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also prefer vanilla icecream but the kids like chocolate and that is what they eat.  My having a preference doesn&#39;t equal everyone doing things my way.  I originally mentioned that I prefer us being on somewhat of the same schedule in response to a mom who was having trouble with her son&#39;s sleeping pattern.  I wanted to give her &quot;permission&quot;, if you will, to verbalize that perhaps she simply had a preference, if indeed that were true for her.  If we can learn to identify the boundaries between preferences (I just like how this feels) and needs (he must learn to sleep on a schedule to get a good job), I think it is then the first step to identifying boundaries between persons (my preference is fine for me but I don&#39;t get to impose that on you).  But just as it is ok for my kids to express their desires based on nothing more than preference, I think it is just as ok for me to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Sunday, December 18, 2005 4:46 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] sleep<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;By saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to get up to feed and clean stalls anymore,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d rather sleep.&quot; or by saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to get up to attend<br/>\n&gt; guitar lessons anymore, I&#39;d rather sleep.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying really hard to understand here, so I&#39;m asking for <br/>\n&gt; clarification.<br/>\n&gt; Earlier, you said the kids had NOT &quot;expressed a desire&quot; to change <br/>\n&gt; their sleep schedule.

His energy builds as the day goes on.  He seems most productive (probably not the best term, but you get the picture) and agreeable at night.  I am the exact same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Having seen so MANY teenagers...get onto these all-night patterns and then be able to easily switch  to different schedules whenever the need arises, I&#39;m just not worried  about sleep.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s reassuring to hear, Pam.  I think the biggest thing I&#39;m concerned about is this sleep schedule becoming an ingrained pattern that would be difficult to switch about if it becomes disruptive to the family.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;It seems like this Tristan is okay being up all night - keeping  <br/>\nhimself busy, right?&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, he definitely can keep himself busy....playing on the computer, watching movies, reading, doing puzzles, etc.  He&#39;s a very responsible kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;I think if he is comfortable with it, I&#39;d let it go - just not make  <br/>\nANY comments or point about it, not for a good long while. Since  <br/>\nsleep was already a big issue for him, when he was in school, it  <br/>\nmakes sense that this is the place he might (subconsciously) test out  <br/>\nall this new unschooling lifestyle stuff.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the insight, Pam.  I was thinking along these lines but wasn&#39;t sure if it was just me trying to rationalize his actions to make myself feel better about allowing him to stay up, if that makes sense.  It&#39;s wonderful to hear the input of others!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;As Rue said, this is all assuming he isn&#39;t keeping other family  <br/>\nmembers up. That&#39;s a different issue than HIM staying up.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part he&#39;s been very quiet.  If the a movie gets a bit loud before I crawl into bed, I mention it to Tristan, and he gets very apologetic and turns it way down.  The exception, of course, was when I intervened early this morning and made him go to bed. (mistake on my part)  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Also - we have a small house and it is hard for people to be quiet  <br/>\nall the time - so when one person is staying up most of the night and  <br/>\nwanting to sleep past noon, it starts to get hard to keep the house  <br/>\nquiet enough - nobody can sing loudly, play music, etc, without  <br/>\nwaking others up. That&#39;s a reasonable thing - to tell the kids that  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll try to keep the house quiet until a certain time, like noon.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a small home, too, so I feel like I have to tiptoe around while Tristan&#39;s in bed.  I know how I hate to be woken up and want to extend him the same courtesy.  There is a time, however, when I do need to get some things done around the house (laundry, etc.), and that is bound to wake him up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the idea of telling him that I can keep the house quiet until a certain time.  That would also give me some much needed quiet time in the mornings while he is still asleep - I used to get this after he went to bed, but it looks like that may be a thing of the past. ;o)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, December 15, 2005 5:36 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] sleep<br/>\n<br/>\n  Right - sorry I got carried away explaining how normal it is for  <br/>\n  teenagers to start getting more energy in the evenings and forgot to  <br/>\n  get back to Tristan, himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":179628783,"authorName":"Malinda Mills","from":"&quot;Malinda Mills&quot; &lt;saprswife@...&gt;","profile":"saprswife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] sleep","postDate":"1134709706","msgId":8392,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZDIwMWM2MDIwMyRhNjFhYTdjMCQwOGJkZmVhOUBNQUxJTkRBPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRudDJvMStscXQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8391,"nextInTopic":8394,"prevInTime":8391,"nextInTime":8393,"topicId":1586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684833553\">&lt;&lt;I guess it would all depend on how much his sleep schedule affects <br/>\neveryone else, that&#39;s the part you need to deal with, not what hours <br/>\nhe sleeps.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, you&#39;re right.

Put some food on a plate for him to snack on during the  <br/>\nnight, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, thinking about this, it all seems so familiar and that&#39;s  <br/>\nbecause my youngest daughter, Rose, who is now almost 15, was about 9  <br/>\nor 10 and was wanting to stay up really late even when her sisters  <br/>\nhad gone to bed, so I sometimes slept out on the couch so that she&#39;d  <br/>\nhave company.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Rue said, this is all assuming he isn&#39;t keeping other family  <br/>\nmembers up. That&#39;s a different issue than HIM staying up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - we have a small house and it is hard for people to be quiet  <br/>\nall the time - so when one person is staying up most of the night and  <br/>\nwanting to sleep past noon, it starts to get hard to keep the house  <br/>\nquiet enough - nobody can sing loudly, play music, etc, without  <br/>\nwaking others up. That&#39;s a reasonable thing - to tell the kids that  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll try to keep the house quiet until a certain time, like noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - my kids have always fallen asleep watching videos - ones  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve seen before, often over and over. So if I really thought  <br/>\nsomeone needed to get to sleep, I could often put on a video, start  <br/>\nwatching it, lower the lights around the house, ask people to quiet  <br/>\ndown/settle down, and usually the sleepy kid would be drawn into the  <br/>\nmovie and would relax and fall asleep. I&#39;d cover the kid with a nice  <br/>\nwarm blanket and let them sleep all night wherever they fell asleep -  <br/>\nbecause if I tried to move them, sometimes that would get them all  <br/>\nwide awake again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter had a friend who would stay up ALL night  <br/>\nwhenever she stayed here. Her family had just a tiny tv that was kept  <br/>\nin the parents&#39; bedroom and the father dominated it - kids were  <br/>\nalmost never allowed to watch anything unless they watched with their  <br/>\nfather, whatever he wanted to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter would turn on the tv and they&#39;d watch movies, but my  <br/>\ndaughter would fall asleep. I&#39;d get up at 7 in the morning and the  <br/>\nother girl would be still watching movies, she&#39;d be FORCING herself  <br/>\nto stay awake and keep watching one movie after another. Her mother  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Oh she&#39;d NEVER go to sleep if the tv was on, she&#39;d watch tv 24  <br/>\nhours a day if I&#39;d let her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yeah, because it was a huge big deal for her, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam - easily sidetracked today &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"sleep","postDate":"1134693953","msgId":8386,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRudDJvMStscXQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1743,"nextInTopic":8387,"prevInTime":8385,"nextInTime":8387,"topicId":1586,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i know MANY teenagers who stay up most of the night - especially those who play online games.
