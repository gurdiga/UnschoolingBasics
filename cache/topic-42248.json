You naturally absorb them. I have a brownie recipe nearly<br/>\nmemorized simply because I use it so darned much. DH can make a batch of<br/>\nbagels from scratch without the cookbook because he&#39;s done it so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading, math, etc are all tools to accomplish a goal. When there&#39;s a<br/>\nreason and a purpose for using those tools, it makes sense to work on<br/>\nthose skills. Why is it that schools require memorizing parts of speech<br/>\nyet don&#39;t require daily/weekly hammering practice? Odds are, being able<br/>\nto use basic home repair tools would be more useful than knowing a<br/>\ngerund from a participle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that &#39;stuff&#39; you&#39;ve been doing together - museums, hikes, etc - keep<br/>\ndoing it. Also go to the grocery store, the post office, the bank, sit<br/>\ntogether and pay bills (not as a lesson, though - DS often helps simply<br/>\nbecause he likes to chat with me as we work...when he was littler he<br/>\njust liked putting the self-adhesive address labels and stamps on the<br/>\nenvelopes...but he&#39;d leave the licking the envelopes to me because it<br/>\ntastes yuck lol). <br/>\n<br/>\nAll those &quot;basics&quot; really ARE basic - they are part of everyday life.<br/>\nAnd life is not divided into subjects like &quot;history&quot; - when you sit<br/>\naround the holiday table talking about great-grandma emigrating to the<br/>\nU.S., that&#39;s History. Watching Bugs Bunny is tons of &quot;history&quot; (and<br/>\nliterature and classical music and lots of other stuff as well).<br/>\n&quot;Academics&quot; are pretty immaterial - they have little to do with actually<br/>\nlearning. Sit back and try to see the learning that happens every day -<br/>\nit probably looks nothing like school or &quot;academics&quot; because &quot;academics&quot;<br/>\nare artificial constructs; living life is organic. Kind of like the<br/>\ndifference between commercially mass produced white bread and home made<br/>\nwhole wheat bread. There&#39;s only a passing resemblance because there&#39;s<br/>\nwheat and yeast involved. The taste and texture and look are very<br/>\ndifferent. Similarly, learning organically only has a passing<br/>\nresemblance to commercial mass produced schooling because some of the<br/>\nsame information is involved. The taste, texture, and look are<br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS is 11 and has never been to school, never been schooled at home<br/>\neither. The other day, we went to a gathering of like-minded folks (but<br/>\nfolks he didn&#39;t know well). He introduced himself to someone there by<br/>\nsaying he knows pi to the second 5 (3.141592385) I learned pi to the<br/>\nfirst 9 way back when (it was part of the cheer for the high school math<br/>\nteam). But, on &quot;Pi Day&quot; this year (3-14) he picked up the next 4 digits<br/>\n(which I didn&#39;t know and sometimes still need to ask him for). He&#39;s<br/>\nplanning to add a couple more digits next year on Pi Day. He knows what<br/>\nit&#39;s used for (he asked) but he just likes knowing it mostly, it&#39;s not<br/>\nyet something he needs to use. He knows nouns and verbs because he likes<br/>\nMad Libs. If you ask him about &quot;history&quot; he&#39;ll look at you sideways.<br/>\nBut, if you ask him about the Korean War, for example, he can give you<br/>\nsome info because he likes watching MASH episodes on DVD. When my mom<br/>\nhad her aortic valve replaced recently, she needed a cardiac<br/>\ncatheterization first. When I was discussing the situation with DS, he<br/>\nsaid &quot;Oh yeah, I saw that on House&quot; - he understood  the procedure and<br/>\nwhat the purpose was without sitting in a biology or anatomy or whatever<br/>\nclass. We pull out resources AS resources - books with anatomy pictures,<br/>\ndictionaries, other reference materials, websites, etc. They are used to<br/>\nanswer or supplement questions/curiosities that come up - like why is it<br/>\ncalled a &#39;window&#39;? what&#39;s the difference between a cape and a peninsula?<br/>\nWhere is Hungary? Why is Oklahoma &#39;tornado alley&#39;?

You *don&#39;t* have to specifically memorize those things to learn them. Memorizing them doesn&#39;t guarantee retention, either, certainly not into adulthood. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo how do people who don&#39;t memorize such things learn them? By being interested in those subjects and having a use for the information. Really. If your dd ends up using a lot of multiplication in her life she&#39;ll come to remember it easily, the same way a carpenter or mechanic can tell you without hesitation that 3/16 is in between 1/8 and 1/4 - although most of them can&#39;t do the math to tell you why! Similarly, most professional writers have a pretty fair grasp on the parts of speech without knowing what a &quot;future perfect&quot; is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Am I just suppose to let her do anything she wants all day in hopes that she finds something constructive to do??<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at someone&#39;s life through a lens of &quot;constructive&quot; or not, you miss a fair amount. What does your dd enjoy? Offer her more things she does, and may enjoy. Those are things that are &quot;meaningful&quot; to her on a personal level, an emotional and spiritual level. That&#39;s something education can&#39;t begin to touch, but unschooling can. Offer her those things that bring light to her eyes, whether that be a day of window shopping, or at the zoo, or snuggled under a big blanket watching tv. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t &quot;leave her&quot; to do any of those things unless she seems to want solitude - be a part of her life. At her side, you can learn to see what she values, what brings her joy, and she&#39;ll learn those things from you, too. Not because you make a lesson of them, but because she&#39;ll value you&#39;re presence. Kids Want to learn from their parents until we suck the joy out of learning by trying to educate them. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappily, that joy in learning is so intrinsic to human nature that it can and does grow back with unschooling. There&#39;s often a transitional time, where your dd might decompress by wanting to avoid anything &quot;educational&quot; for awhile. You can use that as a time to love her and enjoy her company (and research how people learn naturally if you&#39;re freaking out).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would no academics involved at all. She hates math and really doesn&#39;t enjoy reading even though she reads at her grade level or above. She couldn&#39;t care less about history no matter how it is presented to her.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy now-16yo stepson was much the same the year we pulled him out of school, at 13. He claimed to hate learning in every form. A year ago, when his bio mom expressed concern about what he was &quot;learning&quot; though, he said &quot;everyone learns all the time, its impossible to not learn anything....except in school&quot;. He no longer thinks of learning as something to avoid. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s learning math through wood and metal working. He&#39;s discovered there are things he likes to read - some novels, even. Just last night we were talking about the history of food - doesn&#39;t sound very academic, but we touched on the industrial revolution, the effect of immigration on American culture, and the temperance movement, all from me standing in the kitchen making eggnog. Those aren&#39;t subjects he wouldn&#39;t have cared much about if they&#39;d been &quot;presented&quot; to him, but I wasn&#39;t presenting, I was chatting and one thing led to another. That happens a lot in unschooling homes, in the same way it happens a lot with groups of friends. Someone says &quot;hey did you know...?&quot; and then everyone is sharing interesting knowledge or tidbits. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would no academics involved at all.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really depends on what you mean by &quot;academics&quot;. If you mean she may never sit down with a textbook again, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. They&#39;re not always the best resources in the real world! But if she&#39;s interested in nature its unlikely that she&#39;ll avoid seeking more and new information, it just won&#39;t look very much like writing reports. She might dabble in bird identification or want to watch movies about the rainforest. She might wonder about what zoo animals eat and how that differs from what they eat in real life and ask to look that up on the internet - or ask to make real food for a pet or pretend food for a toy. Those are all things my 8yo has done relatively recently. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want &quot;school&quot; to be a battle everyday like it has been the past year.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to battle, but it will involve you stepping back from the idea that learning looks like &quot;education&quot;. It looks like someone enjoying an interest! If you look for ways to support your dd&#39;s interests, and toss out new ideas now and then, when she seems to be running dry, you won&#39;t have nearly so many battles in your life.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New here......","postDate":"1259492275","msgId":42255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZBQkQ5M0JCLTFFNTMtNDQ3NS1BRTE0LUZBQ0VFQzM4MkI3RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhlc2I1cCt0c2FpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhlc2I1cCt0c2FpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42253,"nextInTopic":42264,"prevInTime":42254,"nextInTime":42256,"topicId":42248,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It might look like planning what to spend  <br/>\nbirthday money on.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids -- people -- are constantly constructing a web of connections  <br/>\nthat helps them see how the world works. So, if a child is in a *rich  <br/>\nenvironment with engaged parents*, whatever the child chooses to do  <br/>\nis constructive. (The rich environment with engage parents is vital.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the hard parts of unschooling! We need to trust that  <br/>\nwhatever has captured their imagination is important to them. We may  <br/>\nnot understand its purpose or what they&#39;re using it for, but the  <br/>\nengagement means they&#39;re doing some heavy duty constructing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helps is being with them so parents can absorb enough about what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re into to have conversations about it and to support it  and  <br/>\nstrew some related things. The way you might do with a friend or your  <br/>\nhusband. Don&#39;t take over the interest. Let it be theirs.

The majority of people&#39;s eyes will glaze over at the  <br/>\nendless stream of dates and politics in history class. Not only does  <br/>\nit turn them off of what is a fascinating subject but they forget as  <br/>\nmuch as they can as soon as they can.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil someone has a reason for wanting to know why life was like it  <br/>\nwas and why the strings were being pulled one way rather than  <br/>\nanother, the dates and politics are meaningless.

The enjoyment of visiting  <br/>\nanother world, getting wrapped up in how people used to live is  <br/>\nenough for now. It&#39;s like constructing a giant jigsaw puzzle, one  <br/>\ninteresting area at a time. The more interesting areas that are  <br/>\ncreated, the more likely they&#39;ll fit together and the more larger  <br/>\npatterns will emerge. But she needs to do the constructing, working  <br/>\non areas she thinks are interesting. If you try to direct her, it  <br/>\nwould be as interesting as someone sitting you down and telling you  <br/>\nwhat area of their puzzle you need to work on and what order to put  <br/>\nthe pieces in.

My name is Laura and I have been homeschooling my 8 1/2 yo dd all of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never bought a formal curriculum and have always just used resources that I find via the net. I have always structured our schooling to be like a school room atmosphere....the desk, charts, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil recently she never minded. Lately, we have both been not &#39;feelin the love&quot; with the way I have been &quot;teaching&quot; her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always toyed with the idea of unschooling, but no matter how much I read my insecurites would seep back in and I would start &quot;teaching&quot; her again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith her being an only child we are able to go and do alot of things...museums, hiking, zoos, etc. She is very worldly in the fact that we have always gone and done alot of stuff so she is very &quot;socialized&quot; and aware of everyday things that most kids aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest concern with unschooling is how do kids learn their multiplication tables, parts of speech, etc. The sort of stuff that you actually have to memorize and learn? Am I just suppose to let her do anything she wants all day in hopes that she finds something constructive to do??<br/>\n<br/>\nI know for a fact that if I totally left it up to her there would no academics involved at all. She hates math and really doesn&#39;t enjoy reading even though she reads at her grade level or above. She couldn&#39;t care less about history no matter how it is presented to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need insight and encouragement from someone who has been there and did that.  I don&#39;t want &quot;school&quot; to be a battle everyday like it has been the past year. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance,<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42247,"nextTopicId":42163}}
