As I mentioned, I do<br/>\nbelieve in giving our children conflict resolution tools.  It&#39;s just<br/>\nthat I had just read an article in &quot;Life Learning&quot; that said the<br/>\ncomplete opposite.  So, as I usually do, I put it out to the group to<br/>\nsee if anyone else had a similar experience and if I was missing<br/>\nsomething contrary to what I was currently doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe responses have been very helpful in reaffirming that I am doing<br/>\nthe right thing by being there and helping them with their conflicts.<br/>\n Unfortunately, I was never taught the appropriate way to resolve<br/>\nconflict, so I am continuing to learn along with them and sometimes<br/>\nfeel like I am lacking good tools.  So, I continue to lurk, post, and<br/>\nread in hopes to fill my own tool box with good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your time.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m doing my best to wipe up<br/>\nthe spills, before my kids fall - lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot;<br/>\n&lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; On 9/1/06, hilltowner4 &lt;marla@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I was just reading an article in the most recent &quot;Life Learning&quot; about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; trusting children.

Are you in another room involved in your own thing or are you<br/>\n&gt; sitting on the sidelines waiting for them to figure it out?  Be *with*<br/>\n&gt; them.  They really need you at this age especially if they have not<br/>\n&gt; had good models before.  Try to avoid the conflicts by circumventing<br/>\n&gt; them or heading them off before they start.  Be proactive in seeing<br/>\n&gt; when a conflict might happen and put the brakes on it by going into<br/>\n&gt; action to help them not have to argue or fight.  Look at what their<br/>\n&gt; most common complaints are and see what you can do to fix that.  We<br/>\n&gt; had a problem with three kids wanting to watch 3 different things on<br/>\n&gt; tv (or use tv in 3 different ways such as PS2, PIU, DVD) at the same<br/>\n&gt; time.  Our solution?  Three tv&#39;s and a DVR!  that didn&#39;t completely<br/>\n&gt; solve the problem, but it still helped ease many many arguments over<br/>\n&gt; who gets to watch what when.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do your children see you dealing with conflict resolutions?  A<br/>\n&gt; phrase that I heard often when I was growing up was, &quot;It will be<br/>\n&gt; interesting to see how you work this out.&quot;  My mom said it to us when<br/>\n&gt; we were fighting over tv (and, gosh, we only had 4 stations on a black<br/>\n&gt; and white tv with rabbit ears! LOL!) or when we were having issues<br/>\n&gt; with friends (or teachers) at school.  We were never given effective<br/>\n&gt; tools yet we were expected to find our own solutions.  I will admit<br/>\n&gt; that I do use that phrase often, but with adults.  Like my friend who<br/>\n&gt; decided to park in a handicap parking spot because it was raining and<br/>\n&gt; she was only running in for one thing and ended up with a $500 parking<br/>\n&gt; ticket and whined that it &quot;wasn&#39;t fair&quot; that all the good spots are<br/>\n&gt; taken up by handicap spaces.  I just looked at her and said, &quot;It will<br/>\n&gt; be interesting how you work this out.&quot;  However, my child coming to me<br/>\n&gt; because his sister came in and cleared off aproject he was working on<br/>\n&gt; from the table without asking him first needs me to be involved.<br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ve asked for my help and I am going to offer it.  Your children<br/>\n&gt; are asking for your help as well, even if they aren&#39;t coming directly<br/>\n&gt; to you and saying, &quot;Mom, help us work this out.&quot;  If you heard your<br/>\n&gt; child crying because they had fallen would you go to them?  Yes.  If<br/>\n&gt; your child fell because there was a spilled glass of water on the<br/>\n&gt; kitchen floor wouldn&#39;t you clean it up so that the next time your<br/>\n&gt; child wouldn&#39;t spill?  And (better yet) if you saw a puddle of water<br/>\n&gt; on the kitchen floor and you knew that your child could (not<br/>\n&gt; necessarily would) slip on it wouldn&#39;t you clean it up to keep that<br/>\n&gt; from happening?  Helping our children with conflict resolution is much<br/>\n&gt; like cleaning up a spill on the floor, answering to a cry of pain (or<br/>\n&gt; frustration) from a fall and observing why those falls happen in the<br/>\n&gt; first place and what we can do to prevent them in the future.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -- <br/>\n&gt; Michelle<br/>\n&gt; Michelle Leifur Reid<br/>\n&gt; YOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n&gt; 850-474-0817<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\n&gt; Check out my homeschool cooking classes!<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Conflict resolution: to interfere or not interfere","postDate":"1157296697","msgId":17069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MDMwODE4bTQ5OTQwMzU2dmZmMWE5ODNmNTkxNGEyZmRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkZXB2dis0bXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MDIwODM4cDI4MjU1ZjVjazZmY2E0MGM1MTBkMWU4N2RAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8ZWRlcHZ2KzRtdDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17068,"nextInTopic":17071,"prevInTime":17068,"nextInTime":17070,"topicId":17026,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He was building something with Legos and had<br/>\nleft them there.

What do you choose to do?   My children<br/>\nenjoy spending some time alone and do.   We also spend *a lot* of time<br/>\ntogether, though.  I watch hours of them playing video games or<br/>\nwatching their shows with them (I usually knit or embroidery or sew<br/>\nwhile I do these things because honestly there are only so many times<br/>\nthat I can watch the same episodes of Full Metal Alchemist)  Sometimes<br/>\nI just sit in the room where they are and listen to them interact<br/>\nwhile doing my own thing.  Sometimes I am an active participant in<br/>\ntheir play or projects.  Sometimes they ask me to go away.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We had a problem with three kids wanting to watch 3 different<br/>\n&gt; things on<br/>\n&gt; &gt; tv (or use tv in 3 different ways such as PS2, PIU, DVD) at the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time.

I didn&#39;t say it resolved all the problems, but it did<br/>\nsignificantly help in such a way that if I needed a fourth tv to<br/>\nfurther help I would buy one.  I was just using the tv scenario as an<br/>\nexample of finding ways to lessen avoidable conflicts.  We have a much<br/>\nlarger house than I had ever wanted, but I had 5 people who all wanted<br/>\ntheir own space.  This was the way that we chose to honor that.  We<br/>\nchose to have a larger house and a larger house payment in order to<br/>\nmeet some needs that the members of the family have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess my question is do radical unschoolers actually ever punish<br/>\n&gt; their children or do they stop at reflecting feelings when a<br/>\n&gt; conflict does escalate or a child does something very unfair and<br/>\n&gt; unkind to a sibling?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What purpose does punishment serve in being respectful to another<br/>\nperson?  We think in punitive terms because of our society.  &quot;You do<br/>\nsomething bad, you serve time.&quot;  That goes for murder as well as<br/>\nsquabbling with a sibling.  Does punishment work?  I would look at how<br/>\nmany repeat offenders we have in our prisons as an answer.  Even the<br/>\nstates that have &quot;three strikes then life&quot; have not had much of an<br/>\nimpact on repeat offenders.  They only stop after three times because<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have the ability to offend any longer.  Parental<br/>\npunishments are much the same just on a more local and smaller scale -<br/>\nbut generally with the same results.  If you have used punishment in<br/>\nthe past as a means for controlling a situation, has it worked?  In<br/>\nthe long run?  Or are you still punishing for the same &quot;offenses?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; BTW, I did like how you say &quot;It will be interesting to see how you<br/>\n&gt; work this out?&quot;  I am going to try to start saying that when the<br/>\n&gt; opportunity presents itself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like I said, I don&#39;t use it with my children because it is not an<br/>\neffective tool in helping them learn to resolve conflict.

Helping our children with conflict resolution is much<br/>\nlike cleaning up a spill on the floor, answering to a cry of pain (or<br/>\nfrustration) from a fall and observing why those falls happen in the<br/>\nfirst place and what we can do to prevent them in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":89238718,"authorName":"amazzingpet@aol.com","from":"amazzingpet@...","profile":"amazzingpet","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Conflict resolution: to interfere or not interfere","postDate":"1157206683","msgId":17047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4NS4zZWNlOWMwLjMyMmFlYzliQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17045,"nextInTopic":17051,"prevInTime":17046,"nextInTime":17048,"topicId":17026,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... that the way he advocates speaking seems so fake","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1209365888\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;I never could get past the feeling<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that the way he advocates speaking seems so fake&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla - The response to your question was great, and very informative.  She <br/>\nreally had a lot of great things to say, backed up with experience since her <br/>\nchildren are older now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am with 2 children, I validate and mirror each childs feelings.  Thus, <br/>\nI do not take sides.  I just repeat in my words what each child has just <br/>\nsaid.  I continue to do this, until they resolve it on their own.  I am there to <br/>\nmake sure no one gets hurt, but stand back coaching to help them resolve on <br/>\ntheir own.  I think that Thomas Gordon in PET talks about this.  It is also very <br/>\nhelpful when dealing with a friend or spouse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can appreciate the other posts opinon on NVC.  My experience with NVC has <br/>\nbeen nothing short of awesome!!!   I don&#39;t want you to get discouraged or <br/>\nscared about your workshop that you are going.  I think that if a person is <br/>\nauthentic when they speak in NVC, then what they say will sound authentic.  If you <br/>\nare just reciting it, then it certainly could sound fake.  If you are feeling <br/>\nit, then it will sound authentic.  We read this book for a book club that I was <br/>\nin.  I printed up a sheet with feelings, on it.  When (or afterwards to <br/>\nreconnect) my dh and I get into a dispute, we pull the sheet out and identify what <br/>\nwe are feeling.  I think this is very helpful for men, since they often were <br/>\nnot allowed to identify or have feelings.  This method has helped more marriages <br/>\nwith the people that I know, than any other method.  It is so simple.  If you <br/>\ngo to the seminar, and your dh doesn&#39;t,  you can just give him the sheet of <br/>\nNVC.  My dh never read or attended a seminar.  He just used the one page sheet <br/>\nthat I made up.  I will see if I can post it to the homepage.  In times where <br/>\nI am feeling heated, it gives me a &quot;script&quot; to fall back on; since I am not <br/>\nmuch in &quot;thinking&#39; mode at that time.  It helps me to focus on my feelings, <br/>\nrather than the other person being annoying, rude, irritating, mean, etc.  I feel <br/>\nthat identifying and expressing feelings is modelled to children, they have a <br/>\ngreat basis for futher communication.  My ds is only 3, but he has already <br/>\nstarted expressing how he feels.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and enjoy the seminar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nCynthia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Conflict resolution: to interfere or not interfere","postDate":"1157204971","msgId":17045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1MDk5Q0U4LTUwRDctNDA3NC1BRjE4LTEzNDFBODcwRDg5RUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkOW5hNStzbTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVkOW5hNStzbTZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17028,"nextInTopic":17047,"prevInTime":17044,"nextInTime":17046,"topicId":17026,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
