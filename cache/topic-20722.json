Its a gift that he is offering. At the moment he is trying to <br/>\nnegotiate with a friend&#39;s father so that his friend can have a cat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you would have offered, when the friend wanted to stay and the mom <br/>\nwanted him to go, to bring the friend back later? Could you have stepped in <br/>\nand upped the pressure on the friend&#39;s mom to negotiate something else. I <br/>\nthink what your son is doing is a powerful thing, he&#39;s saying that there <br/>\naren&#39;t only two choices in any given moment and that negotiation is a good <br/>\nthing. If it was Simon I would explain why I thought the other parent was <br/>\nsaying no, after the incident, so like with the cat my belief is that the <br/>\nparents don&#39;t want pets of any kind and that they will come up with lots of <br/>\nreasons, when really it is just that they don&#39;t want to find a way to say <br/>\nyes. Maybe help your son to see that some moms don&#39;t want to look for <br/>\nsolutions outside of what they&#39;ve already said must happen. But don&#39;t tell <br/>\nhim that it isn&#39;t worth trying to help find other solutions.

Newbie chiming in here ... new to the list not to homeschooling or unschooling.    <br/>\nMy kids have ALWAYS done this from the time they could speak... not so much offering it to other folks but as far as our conflicts are concerned.    One time in particular was hilarious when my then 8 yr old suggested that Grandpa maybe needed to take a walk and find his calm when he was frustrated with the loss of his favorite binoculars by a friend who wasn&#39;t careful with the possessions of others!!    At any rate we have had a few situations over the years when they have offered suggestions to other families that weren&#39;t well received.   I have tried to remind them that as kind as it was to help that sometimes other families prefer to talk out their own solutions.    Usually later I explain that we should respect other&#39;s rights to find what works for them and how proud I am of their kindness in offering help.    I had a mother once SCREAM at my then 7 yr old to &quot;mind her own damn business&quot;  when she suggested that the other mother&#39;s child was just feeling rushed (in her<br/>\n view which I would have to agree with!)  and perhaps if she could give her just 5 minutes to be ready to leave.   Given that situation we felt it was best to explain to our kids how some folks just don&#39;t like to be helped in that way and some folks don&#39;t respect children in the same way we do in our home.    I find that children that are parented in kind, compassionate, respectful ways tend to always want to help everyone... they are the champions of the underdog and the one that is going to defend all downtrodden!     I don&#39;t suppose that&#39;s a bad thing at all.     I consider it a victory that my parents realize my point now about respecting children as people with full rights to freedom rather than extensions of the parent and little people who need to be controlled.   My mother in particular has been in my home many times when my circle of friends are here and the kids are playing... she is amazed at how 10-20 kids of all ages can play and hang out and rarely have a<br/>\n conflict and at how gentle the parents are with their children.    In her day it just wasn&#39;t a concept that  many embraced.     I will have to say that my parents must have embraced it to some extent because I never felt confined (other than in school)  and I always knew that if I disagreed with their rules or whatever I was free to discuss why and my opinion was respected (I didn&#39;t always get my way but I always felt heard!)   Anyway  I am so glad to find this list (THanks Lena!)  and glad to spend more time with Ren whom I meet at last fall&#39;s FLT gathering here in NC (My two oldest were the ones that sat intently watching for two days while you did makeup ...Sarah 16 and Anna 13)   <br/>\nCheers, <br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNever Miss an Email<br/>\nStay connected with Yahoo!
