We are in the process of figuring out this same question.  When we changed over to the unschooling way of thinking, things have not settled into a set routine.  Hubby wants to have sit down dinners when he is home.  He travels 4-5 days a week, and usually is gone 2-3 weeks out of the month.  Since we have changed our way of thinking, my son is into watching TV whenever we are home.  He loves cartoon network.  He does not want to leave the TV to eat dinner.  We had a talk just today, and came up with several alternatives that work for all of us, so everyone is happy.  We have decided that we will now eat dinner at a later time some nights, so he will not miss the shows that are the most important to him.  On those nights, I will have a snack ready for hubby, if he is in town.  When he gets home from work, he is starving, but said that it would work out for him that way.  We also agreed-ed that we would video<br/>\n tape the shows he is missing if we have an earlier dinner, an he can watch after he is done with dinner.  This agreement is good with everyone, and no one feels like they are being slighted.   <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\nDana Matt &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hoffmanwilson@...\">hoffmanwilson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salgenovese@...\">salgenovese@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &quot;So I&#39;m curious what unschooling families do--skip<br/>\n&gt; big sit<br/>\n&gt; down big meals, have them completely optional, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we have &quot;meals&quot; at our house.

Sierra was just asking for some Thai noodles, it <br/>\nwas about 10:30pm here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we had a small friend over. I had platters of <br/>\ncheese,homemade bread, breadsticks, grapes, cut apples, peanut <br/>\nbutter, jelly, yogurt and M&M&#39;s, all set out on the table. The kids <br/>\ngrazed all day. They love it when I have platters set out!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would personally love to get into more of a pattern of eating <br/>\nmeals together in the evening. If you like that, and it works for <br/>\nyou, GREAT. If something else works better, GREAT.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, it just isn&#39;t working out for us to all be together at <br/>\nthe same time in the evenings...other times we are and I feel like <br/>\ncooking. It all depends.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have much of anything set in stone over here. We do what <br/>\nworks today, and don&#39;t worry about it.
