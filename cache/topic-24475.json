We have only lived here for about 10 months so we didn&#39;t know any of the 3 kids well.  I don&#39;t know why this has happened here but from what my son told me about the way the students are treated at school and the way some of the teachers spoke to the kids and from what I saw when I was there, the atmosphere was much more like a war zone than an institute of learning.  I also experienced this to a bit lesser degree in the elementary school my dd started in.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I understand how easy it can be to not be mindful and loving and respectful, without any bad intention, but with devastating results.  I am so deeply sad that those 3 young people were desperate enough to end their lives.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My son has taken up his own unschooling campaign.  When he was still in school, he told everyone he spoke to at school about it and told them to read the Teenage Liberation book.  Now that he is out of school, he is talking about it on his MySpace and emailing all the kids he knows.  He wants them to know that there is a choice that they can make.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If I hadn&#39;t stumbled across this way of life by accident, it never would have occurred to me to take my kids out of school and let them learn on their own.  I am sure there are many others that would do the same.  As an example, I have an older sister who stopped speaking to me when I first took my dd out of school in Jan.  Recently, I sent out an email to my family and a few close friends explaining the changes we have gone through and a bit about unschooling.  My sister read it and went on line and researched unschooling.  Then she wrote me and told me that her grandson was having a lot of trouble in school and she was thinking of buying some unschooling books for his mom.  <br/>\n  You never know...<br/>\n   <br/>\n  in peace,<br/>\n  Dianna<br/>\n  thehomeopathicway.blogspot.com<br/>\n  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          <br/>\nIn a message dated 6/13/2007 11:24:18 P.M.
