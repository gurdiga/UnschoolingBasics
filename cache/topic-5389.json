My <br/>\nyoungest<br/>\nson is going to be 3 in a few months time.  He is a bit of a handful (a<br/>\ngorgeous one however!) - yeah, he takes a lot of energy!<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other folks on the list who have a similar situation with <br/>\na<br/>\nbig age gap?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys are 17 and nine, so yes. Cameron came out of school at 12 (the <br/>\nend of sixth grade). Duncan was four.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest (daniel) seems to be happy, but he is also a little bored, and<br/>\noften seems at a loose end.  He complains sometimes about feeling <br/>\nlonely.<br/>\nThis is nto a huge issue, but I just feel that he does need to be doing<br/>\nmore.  I find I am often feelign so damn tired from the smaller one <br/>\nthat my<br/>\ncreativity just kind of flies out the window.  I am not doing enough,<br/>\nstrewing enough.  I feel really lazy actually. Feel like I am just <br/>\ndoing the<br/>\nbasics and nto much else (I mean survival basics).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron spent his first 18 months out of school doing nothing biut <br/>\nwatching tv, sleeping, talking on the phone, and eating. So, yeah... it <br/>\nseemed as if he were a bit bored! &lt;g&gt; But he was healing. From the <br/>\ndamage of school. He spent a good deal of time on the computer chatting <br/>\nwith friends, and we had someone over here as much as possible---or he <br/>\nwent there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a tough age. They sleep a lot---are you letting him sleep as <br/>\nmuch as possible? As late as possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSO often when I think about doing something with Dan, I get disheartened<br/>\nbecause I know it will inevitably lead to little one wanting to get in <br/>\non<br/>\nit, and then Dan getting frustrated with him. I find this stresful. I <br/>\nfind<br/>\nmy energy levels are not so good lately and so its very easy for me to <br/>\ntalk<br/>\nmyself out of doing stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe baby would probably enjoy just about everything Dan would like--on <br/>\na smaller scale. Just take him along! Duncan went everywhere with us. <br/>\nIn fact, Duncan went MORE places! I&#39;d tell Cameron that we (Duncan & I) <br/>\nwere going to the zoo, museum, beach, park, eat sushi.... whereever. <br/>\nDid Cameron want to come with u?  It took a while for him to start <br/>\njoining us, but he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they are best buds. They do lots of things together---even with the <br/>\nbig age gap!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had a few really bad days in a row here lately. Cameron took <br/>\nDuncan out for the day to give me some space (that car is worth every <br/>\npenny! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best suggestion is for YOU to just DO. Let the boys tag along. Do <br/>\nfun stuff. Things YOU never got to do as a child. Find wonder in <br/>\neverything. BE interested. BE interesting! They&#39;ll join you when THEY <br/>\nare ready!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, btdt! &lt;G&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help with big age gap!","postDate":"1113321319","msgId":5392,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzZ3IxNytqcThuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5391,"nextInTopic":5398,"prevInTime":5391,"nextInTime":5393,"topicId":5389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Having sat and pondered more on this - maybe YOU are the one who needs to get out more (or stay in and have the kids go out more).

I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking of children&#39;s museums, the zoo, etc. Also - places like <br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s place space gives your little one something to do while you <br/>\nand Dan talk or play cards or other simple games. We&#39;d go there and <br/>\nspend hours - I&#39;d get a cup of coffee and the kids would get an ice <br/>\ncream. We met some other homeschoolers there - doing the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvite other homeschoolers over to hang out with Dan. Have a movie <br/>\nnight once a week. Or a gaming afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely go to park days - if you don&#39;t have park days to go to, <br/>\nstart a group. It is VERY VERY easy and doesn&#39;t take a lot of energy - <br/>\nreally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee if Dan wants to sign up for something new - karate, 4H, etc., so <br/>\nthat he has something more on his calendar and something to work on at <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nMovies? Do you have Netflix? Dan could browse the movies looking for <br/>\nthose that interest him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you get to the library weekly?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know other people here will disagree but I&#39;m not at all opposed to a <br/>\ncouple of hours a few days per week of preschool for younger kids, to <br/>\ngive mom and older kids some time. I was lucky that my mom ran a <br/>\npreschool, so my little ones could go to Grandma&#39;s school. And I know <br/>\nit can be hard to find an old-fashioned non-academic free-play <br/>\nnon-daycare preschool. But they ARE still out there - many high schools <br/>\nand community colleges have lab schools that are NOT academic and allow <br/>\nkids to come for just a couple of hours a couple of days per week. <br/>\nThere are also such programs run by city recreation departments. This <br/>\noption works very well when the younger kid is outgoing and social and <br/>\nenjoys that extra time with a group of other children. Not all kids do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr - maybe just set up a &quot;trading kids&quot; day with another mom. I&#39;m just <br/>\ntalking about a couple of hours - but then you can plan on having that <br/>\ntime with your older son and the two of you can plan ahead what you&#39;re <br/>\ngoing to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to know what else to suggest without knowing your older son <br/>\n- what his temperament is like and the kinds of things in which he is <br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 12, 2005, at 5:06 AM, Hilary Jackson wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  I find I am often feelign so damn tired from the smaller one that my<br/>\n&gt; creativity just kind of flies out the window.

Then work together to <br/>\nseek out opportunities for it. Use tidbits of time before the little <br/>\none is awake or after he falls asleep to talk about what you are <br/>\nfinding and make plans.
