It doesn&#39;t help with school and CPS worker, police or suspicious neighbors -- more importantly though, it doesn&#39;t help YOU inside your own skin.  Sometimes what is needed isn&#39;t only &quot;deschooling&quot; but a whole &quot;decompression&quot; of attitude about the world and other people and how everything works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are all wound up for a fight, which is taking you in exactly the wrong direction of peaceful relationships and successful unschooling, interfering with your thinking, talking, reasoning and choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not a lawyer but I had credentials and decades of expertise in education policy and education legislation at every level (local, state and federal) before becoming a newbie homeschool-unschool mom.  I urge you to hear and believe me when say that on balance, the legal/political defend-my-rights view has gotten in my way much more than it has helped us, to successfully unschool.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39750,"nextTopicId":39777}}
