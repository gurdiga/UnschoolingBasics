My 7 year olds social skills and ability to cope are more like that of a 3 year old. She can not get along with her sister, and she is bigger than her older sister. I can not just tell them to work it out or play together when the 7 year old is pummeling the 8 year old. For my 7 year old it&#39;s not about attention. She has no self control, no impulse control and no ability to keep her hands to herself. I as a parent have to step in and protect my 8 year old. I have to step in and model appropriate behavior, and I have to separate them if need be. And I can&#39;t turn away.

I assume<br/>\nthat if they&#39;re doing something to get attention, then I should have<br/>\nbeen giving them attention long before they had to pull out a really<br/>\npoor tool to get what they need! If 2,3 and 4 year old children are<br/>\nusing poor behavior to get attention, why on earth weren&#39;t they<br/>\ngetting that attention WAY before that? THey&#39;re little. They NEED a<br/>\nlot of attention and parental involvement. <br/>\n<br/>\nFighting is a sign for more attention, true. But not because they just<br/>\nwant you to notice them, they need better tools for solving problems<br/>\nwith each other and they can&#39;t possibly have them at those young<br/>\nages!! So basically, you&#39;re saying the biggest, strongest, meanest<br/>\nsibling gets their way? That is horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list does not promote ignoring children, parents being the<br/>\n&quot;queen&quot; of their household (we prefer using methods that are<br/>\nconsensual and honor every person regardless of age) or any other<br/>\npunitive or disrespectful methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kind of behaviors (on the parents part) really get in the way of<br/>\nunschooling. The trust factor needs to be very high for unschooling to<br/>\nunfold in the best possible manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids need to trust that you&#39;ll protect them (even from each other),<br/>\nthat you see and hear them, that you light up when they come into the<br/>\nroom and that their needs/wishes/desires will be taken seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend you read the book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; as soon<br/>\nas possible. Your babies need you to be there for them, not ignore<br/>\ntheir most difficult moments.

I assume<br/>\nthat if they&#39;re doing something to get attention, then I should have<br/>\nbeen giving them attention long before they had to pull out a really<br/>\npoor tool to get what they need! If 2,3 and 4 year old children are<br/>\nusing poor behavior to get attention, why on earth weren&#39;t they<br/>\ngetting that attention WAY before that? THey&#39;re little. They NEED a<br/>\nlot of attention and parental involvement. <br/>\n<br/>\nFighting is a sign for more attention, true. But not because they just<br/>\nwant you to notice them, they need better tools for solving problems<br/>\nwith each other and they can&#39;t possibly have them at those young<br/>\nages!! So basically, you&#39;re saying the biggest, strongest, meanest<br/>\nsibling gets their way? That is horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list does not promote ignoring children, parents being the<br/>\n&quot;queen&quot; of their household (we prefer using methods that are<br/>\nconsensual and honor every person regardless of age) or any other<br/>\npunitive or disrespectful methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose kind of behaviors (on the parents part) really get in the way of<br/>\nunschooling. The trust factor needs to be very high for unschooling to<br/>\nunfold in the best possible manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids need to trust that you&#39;ll protect them (even from each other),<br/>\nthat you see and hear them, that you light up when they come into the<br/>\nroom and that their needs/wishes/desires will be taken seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend you read the book &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; as soon<br/>\nas possible. Your babies need you to be there for them, not ignore<br/>\ntheir most difficult moments. If Mom doesn&#39;t know what to do when they<br/>\nfight, how on earth are wee children going to know what to do ? <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288459721,"authorName":"Georgette Teekel","from":"Georgette Teekel &lt;beautifulsassyprincess@...&gt;","profile":"beautifulsassyprincess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Fighting Siblings","postDate":"1174998051","msgId":22601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5NjY5MC44NzA3OC5xbUB3ZWI1NzgwOC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2NTU2MS42NDM5OC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMS5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":22600,"nextInTopic":22604,"prevInTime":22600,"nextInTime":22602,"topicId":22573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE,IF YOU TURN AWAY AND LET CHILDREN KNOW IT DOESN T BOTHER YOU in my EXPERIENCE that ll make them stop,there only doing it in m","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1111278466\">I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU PEOPLE,IF YOU TURN AWAY AND LET CHILDREN KNOW IT DOESN&#39;T BOTHER YOU in my EXPERIENCE that&#39;ll make them stop,there only doing it in m EXPERIENCE to get attention and there again my CHILDREN ARE 2,3 AND 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nVickisue Gray &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:vickisue_gray@...\">vickisue_gray@...</a>&gt; wrote:          I agree with Kelly and Ren on this one (and pretty much everything else, lol)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an older brother who was just plain violent.

Have <br/>\nyou talked with the kids about what you are doing and why or just <br/>\nsaid &quot;no more rules, no more punishment&quot;? What do they think of the <br/>\nidea?<br/>\n<br/>\n*Siblings without Rivalry* is a good place to start. It would <br/>\nprobably also be a good idea to start holding the expectation that <br/>\nyou will be spending a LOT of time with your kids for awhile, <br/>\nhelping them figure out how to communicate and learn to problem <br/>\nsolve and resolve conflicts. At this point, they are back to having <br/>\nthe social skills of two year olds - you took away the &quot;rules&quot; but <br/>\nthey haven&#39;t had the chance to learn the kinds of skills people need <br/>\nto get along with each other without those rules. No wonder they are <br/>\nhitting and biting and name-calling!<br/>\n<br/>\nLet everything else go, if necessary, and focus on building a new <br/>\nfamily relationship. Let the kids know that *you* are learning this <br/>\ntoo, right along with them. Ask them if they would like to read the <br/>\nbook with you or read on some websites about different ways to get <br/>\nalong. Actually, if the kids are interested in doing some reading <br/>\n(or having you read to them) I totally recommend *Parenting a Free <br/>\nChild* by Rue Kream. I recommend it anyway - its a wonderful look at <br/>\nhow an unschooling family works. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Fighting Siblings","postDate":"1174946153","msgId":22585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV1OWZoOSt2N21pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwNjQ2Ni41ODA5MC5xbUB3ZWI1NzgwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22584,"nextInTopic":22586,"prevInTime":22584,"nextInTime":22586,"topicId":22573,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I tell my children if they can t get along they have to ONLY play with the one that there having trouble with,you ll be amazed how quick they ll be nice to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1934197885\">~~I tell my children if they can&#39;t get along they have to ONLY play<br/>\nwith the one that there having trouble with,you&#39;ll be amazed how quick<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be nice to one another if they only have each other to play with~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWow...if someone made me hang out with people that were annoying me,<br/>\nI&#39;d REALLY resent them.
