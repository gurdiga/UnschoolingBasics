In all this time, we have broken one <br/>\nglass and one very old, already chipped small plate.  And we use zero <br/>\nplastic, all materials in our kitchen are real.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think both of my kids know, that if mommy doesn&#39;t get her work <br/>\ndone, like going to the grocery store, working the garden, cleaning <br/>\nthe kitchen, preparing meals, we really do not eat.  It is a matter <br/>\nof life and death, the work we do and I take it seriously, and they, <br/>\ntoo, grasp the seriousness of life&#39;s necessities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDDs daddy, he just doesnt know what to do with her when he tries to <br/>\nplay with her, because he does the thing above, &quot;what do you <br/>\nwant&quot; &quot;what is it, Ani, what would you like to do?&quot;  She&#39;s two, she <br/>\nwants YOU to do something interesting, something that she can learn <br/>\nfrom, something that is a rich experience.  That&#39;s why she follows me <br/>\naround all day, because I do interesting stuff, and take the time to <br/>\ninclude her in it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my son, who&#39;s much older (11 next Friday!), he&#39;s not quite as <br/>\nkeen on watching me work any longer, but he loved to watch me when he <br/>\nwas a baby.  Actually, I think that&#39;s where he got his love of <br/>\nmusical theatre, because I thought I should be talking to him as I <br/>\nworked, but I didnt know what to &quot;say&quot; to a baby about cleaning and <br/>\ncooking and so on, so I just sung about everything I did, all day <br/>\nlong, throughout the day.  Whistle while you work?  He wasn&#39;t as <br/>\nphysically included in the work, but he was still with me, being a <br/>\npart of the larger plan that keeps life going.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, though, he&#39;s beginning to embark on his own vocation <br/>\nand isn&#39;t as interested in my daily drudgery.  He actually said one <br/>\nday, &quot;I don&#39;t need to learn how to do dishes, I&#39;m going to be rich, <br/>\nand I will not have to do dishes when I am older.&quot;  Good plan, and <br/>\nhe&#39;s probably right.  I think he&#39;s also afraid I may ask HIM to do <br/>\nsome of the work, and he&#39;s learned--from schooling--that &quot;work&quot; is <br/>\nnot fun or importatnt; rather it is a trivial time-waster.  We&#39;re <br/>\nstill deschooling, in that sense, with him.  So, I don&#39;t try to make <br/>\nhim find my work interesting, I let him pursue his own, and support <br/>\nhim in his interests.  Whenever he completes a lego vehicle or new <br/>\nplaymobil scene, he comes to get me, and I admire his ingeuinety.  He <br/>\nknows that he is welcome to be a part of what I may be doing if he <br/>\ndoes find it interesting, and I will slow down for him, too, to <br/>\ninclude him in the work, if that is his need or desire. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest issue is that of the larger society, a society that does <br/>\nnot value children, women&#39;s work, or real work, in general.  Even <br/>\namong the pro-child, activist circle in which I run, many of the <br/>\nmothers, when they come out to do something (support Midwives, do LLL <br/>\nfunctions, etc), they leave their children at home.  Many times, when <br/>\nI am out in public, we (me & my children) are the only people, <br/>\nanywhere, with children, unless it is a place specifically FOR <br/>\nchildren.  I believe children belong in, and should be within, the <br/>\nlarger society, to learn, to grow, to contribute.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, to me, the Continum Concept, applied to our modern, western <br/>\nlife.  <br/>\n<br/>\nlaura<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Therese&quot; <br/>\n&lt;theresefranklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; So have most of you read this book?

What are your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it to be highly fascinating.. but difficult to see how to <br/>\napply her wisdom attained from the Yequana, to our Western ways.  <br/>\nDon&#39;t get me wrong, I have worn dd2 to my body, co-sleep and <br/>\nbreastfed since birth- thats not a problem.  But as the kids get to <br/>\nthat 2 year old stage, it seems that the more I ask what she wants <br/>\nall the time, the more unhappy she is.  Liedloff seemed to view child-<br/>\ncenteredness as the issue because what she saw was the Yequana <br/>\nchildren being rarely the &#39;center&#39; of attention, instead the adults <br/>\nwere focused on doing their work in order to survive, while the <br/>\nchildren were steeped in this real-life learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my dd&#39;s are looking for me to be more of a leader.  To go <br/>\nabout more adult- real-world activities for her to view / be apart <br/>\nof.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the article by Liedloff about &#39;Whose in control&#39;..<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html\">http://www.continuum-concept.org/reading/whosInControl.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I am running into is that I have no problem going about <br/>\nmy day- but I worry that my dd&#39;s are frustrated at the lack of &#39;adult <br/>\nstuff I do&#39; when what they mostly sees is A.) Me on the computer and <br/>\nB.) Doing static things like dishes and laundry, etc.  Whereas the <br/>\nYequana children, while not being the &#39;center&#39; of attention, were <br/>\nentrenched in real-world survival skills around them all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo this thinking led me to this AWSOME article by Scott Noelle about <br/>\nthis very subject;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scottnoelle.com/parenting/child-centered.htm\">http://www.scottnoelle.com/parenting/child-centered.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWOW.
