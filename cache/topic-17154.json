It involves <br/>\nfinding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both parties <br/>\nare not only considered but addressed. Everyone&#39;s wants and needs are <br/>\nequally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or needs are <br/>\ndiscussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or negotiated <br/>\nwhich meet the underlying needs of all parties. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living <br/>\nconsensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be <br/>\nopen to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore <br/>\nthe issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences. Parenting <br/>\nis a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to practice <br/>\nthis process, and can do so if the environment remains one of respect, <br/>\ncompassion, exploration and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195223619,"authorName":"SquishyMommy1@aol.com","from":"SquishyMommy1@...","profile":"steveshotwife2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Mindful Parenting Group?","postDate":"1157877318","msgId":17156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzYy4yNDVhMTIzLjMyMzUyODQ2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17154,"nextInTopic":17157,"prevInTime":17155,"nextInTime":17157,"topicId":17154,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"_http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mindfulparenting/_ (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mindfulparenting/) There ya go In a message dated 9/9/2006 7:44:08 P.M.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1762529810\">_http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mindfulparenting/_ <br/>\n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mindfulparenting/) <br/>\n <br/>\nThere ya go<br/>\n <br/>\nIn a message dated 9/9/2006 7:44:08 P.M.
