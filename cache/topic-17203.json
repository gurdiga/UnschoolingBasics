My kids and I have done that lots of times. But that&#39;s different than a forced schooling situation. It takes a *really* strong parent and child to overcome the messages being given.

Even  <br/>\nfor kids who&#39;ve been in school for a short while. (How deeply buried  <br/>\nthey get often depends on personality and the parents&#39; attitudes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI pursued a lot of interests while I was in public school but I was  <br/>\npursuing them through the idea that they weren&#39;t as important to my  <br/>\nfuture as what I &quot;should&quot; be learning in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids see school as bogus right from the beginning. If a parent  <br/>\nshares that opinion, but the child needs to go to school for what  <br/>\never reason (problem divorce, financial reasons or  whatever), then  <br/>\nthe idea that school learning is important won&#39;t have as great an  <br/>\nimpact as it would on most children.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most children don&#39;t have that advantage.

Why shouldn&#39;t they?  <br/>\nOver 90% of the people around them believe it. They *have* to believe  <br/>\nit or all the torture they&#39;re going through to succeed in school is  <br/>\nfor nothing. It&#39;s self-preservation to believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo just because it&#39;s possible to pursue interests while still  <br/>\nschooling, doesn&#39;t mean that every child who does trusts that what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing is important.

I was talking <br/>\nabout parenting respectfully. AP, positive parenting, any of the <br/>\nother labels it is given. THAT is not synonymous with unschooling.  <br/>\nSome parents who send their children to school still parent this <br/>\nway. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I agree that seeing the value in our childrens interests, <br/>\nand seeing learning everywhere, not just at school is very <br/>\nimportant.  But you could still go to school and think this way.  It <br/>\nwould be more difficult to combat all the opposite thinking from <br/>\nschool.

It takes the power to learn away <br/>\nfrom the individual and puts it in the hands of the &quot;professionals.&quot; <br/>\nAdd to that the way parents are pressured to have their kids conform <br/>\nand acheive and we have the situation as it is today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.  But I&#39;m talking about seeing school in a different light. <br/>\nJust because it gives that impression doesn&#39;t mean she and her child <br/>\nhave to see it that way.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree wholeheartedly that schoo is just another tool.

I will be the first to admit I am not <br/>\na big advocate of public/traditional schooling. Or *schooling* at <br/>\nall for that matter.  But I don&#39;t believe we have to believe or live <br/>\nby those ideas just because sometimes circumstances force us to <br/>\nparticipate.  There IS value in school, an art class for example, or <br/>\nsome other activitiy where you want to learn more about something. <br/>\nBut you only have to take away from it what you feel is valuable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Keep parenting respectfully.

He spent about 4 hours yesterday trying NOT to do his<br/>\nhomework. It&#39;s not that he has trouble understanding the stuff, but he<br/>\nsays it&#39;s so boring... I need to talk to someone at school and see<br/>\nwhat they can do... either give him some more challenging work to do<br/>\nor find a different approach to teaching him. Part of the problem is<br/>\nthat he&#39;s not SHOWING that he can do the work because he&#39;s resisting<br/>\nit so much...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know better now, different approach: let him learn at his own pace...<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to his teacher was a waste of time...the jist of it was that<br/>\nwe HAD to MAKE him do his work or he&#39;d fail... he did manage to pretty<br/>\nmuch get all A&#39;s... almost always at the last minute for some things...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had some problems with his brothers re: homework to a lesser<br/>\ndegree... at the school the boys went to, they gave homework 2 or 3x<br/>\nweek in KINDERGARTEN...can you say insane?? They didn&#39;t call it<br/>\n&quot;homework&quot; but parent-child learning or somesuch oddness... Was 4x<br/>\nweek from 1st grade on... (and from 3rd grade on, all homework &<br/>\nschoolwork was tied to the school&#39;s precious achievement<br/>\ntests...teaching To The Test in other words, ugh..that was one of the<br/>\nreasons I pulled the boys, the other was we hardly saw our then-7 yo<br/>\nbecause he would come home & be asleep within an hour of returning<br/>\nhome & wake up in time to go to school)...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the boys had handwriting problems and his teacher was making<br/>\nhim stay in at recess to practice it...I didn&#39;t know that, else I<br/>\nwould have had a MAJOR fit... at the time I was concerned about<br/>\nhandwriting but not to the point of traumatizing my kid over it.. ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad they&#39;re out of that environment...this is our 2nd &quot;year&quot;.. (or<br/>\nrather they&#39;ve been free of public school system for 15 months now)...<br/>\nwe started with something of a curriculum (Robinson Curriculum which<br/>\nis set up for them to teach themselves) but we found out pretty quick<br/>\nthat we didn&#39;t want to do schoolwork patrol... it was more than that,<br/>\nthough: why pull them from school to do more or less the same stuff<br/>\nthey&#39;d do IN school?

However, I can&#39;t imagine<br/>\n&gt; &gt; YOUR child would be the ONLY child that has had slipping grades.<br/>\n&gt; No, but until now she&#39;s been &quot;the best&quot; in class, with &quot;the best&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; grades and certificate for the year and so on. She could read before  <br/>\n&gt; school started and was very excited one year ago (unfortunately, she  <br/>\n&gt; has lost interest in all the subjects which are taught by strict  <br/>\n&gt; teachers, math for instance). If she would suddenly drop grades it  <br/>\n&gt; would be kind of &quot;suspicious&quot; I think � the teacher really likes her  <br/>\n&gt; and she would probably instantly ask if something is wrong at home  <br/>\n&gt; etc. It would be awkward if she suddenly told at school that at home,  <br/>\n&gt; her mother tells her she &quot;doesn&#39;t have to do&quot; homework or something  <br/>\n&gt; like that. It is very much expected that the parents cooperate - and  <br/>\n&gt; even that the parents are &quot;on the same side&quot; as the teachers (like,  <br/>\n&gt; if the teachers think it&#39;s reasonable to punish somehow, they expect  <br/>\n&gt; the parents side with the teachers, not with the children (&quot;punish&quot;  <br/>\n&gt; is such a hard word though, they are very &quot;kind&quot; in their  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;consequences&quot;, I just don&#39;t know a better word in English). So I&#39;m  <br/>\n&gt; just afraid they will start wondering too much. But of course, they  <br/>\n&gt; cannot interfere with my parenting style unless it seems *really*  <br/>\n&gt; damaging to them. And also, I think a part of me is just not  <br/>\n&gt; deschooled enough (what will my family think? how can I explain? what  <br/>\n&gt; if she has to repeat classes?)...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What happens to parents that just can&#39;t make their kids do their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; homework?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;d have to stay longer at school, a mixture of punishment and  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;promotion&quot; (?) &quot;furtherance&quot; (?) to &quot;help&quot; them get better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I never did my homework, rarely went to school for that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; matter when I was in Junior High and High School. My mom tried<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;make&quot; me. It didn&#39;t work. I only did what I felt necessary or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interesting. Don&#39;t make her. Help her if SHE wants to do it, and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; make sure she knows YOU think it&#39;s ok if she doesn&#39;t get it. You<br/>\n&gt; &gt; are her biggest advocate, supporter and influence. If you don&#39;t put<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the same kind of emphasis on &quot;school&quot; as you do on just learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; naturally, she probably wont either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really understand what you are saying and I wished it was that  <br/>\n&gt; easy. Actually, that&#39;s what I would like to do most � but I&#39;m just  <br/>\n&gt; afraid she&#39;ll have to repeat class then, or I dunno! Maybe she&#39;ll  <br/>\n&gt; never do homework again and then the teacher is mad and then school  <br/>\n&gt; is even worse for her and the less she&#39;ll want to do anything at all;  <br/>\n&gt; then other children start picking at her etc... well it&#39;s probably  <br/>\n&gt; the worst scenario and maybe not what will really happen. But she  <br/>\n&gt; herself is terrified whenever she jsut *forgot* homework, and thinks  <br/>\n&gt; that something horrible is going to happen (she doesn&#39;t know what  <br/>\n&gt; will happen though, i&#39;ve asked her what would be the worst thing, but  <br/>\n&gt; she can&#39;t answer this, I dunno why she is so terrified actually)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think I saw in a previous post that you were going to be moving in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the future (a couple of years?) to a place where homeschooling was<br/>\n&gt; &gt; legal? Maybe that was someone else though...but either way, if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; were you, I would just keep moving toward that goal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yeah that was me � we&#39;ll do our best, but England is expensive, and  <br/>\n&gt; we&#39;ll have to save up a loooooot of money and it will take some years  <br/>\n&gt; to do this. But we really want to go and have started saving up.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Keep parenting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respectfully. Keep learning through life. That&#39;s all we are all<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doing anyway. Just let her &quot;school&quot; experience be another tool in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her learning toolbox.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you, and thank all the others who have answered my question. I  <br/>\n&gt; will do some kind of mix, I&#39;ll talk to the teacher, I&#39;ll talk to my  <br/>\n&gt; daughter, I&#39;ll make her feel it&#39;s not that important, if she asks  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll tell her my feelings  and thoughts about school, I&#39;ll help her  <br/>\n&gt; with her homework if she wants to do them, I&#39;ll try to find other  <br/>\n&gt; games and activities which could be fun to excercise math without  <br/>\n&gt; forcing her or being disappointed if she doesn&#39;t like it... and I&#39;ll  <br/>\n&gt; do some of the homework for her if I know she understands it anyway  <br/>\n&gt; and she&#39;ll probably be so thankful she&#39;ll have fun and will love that  <br/>\n&gt; idea. We&#39;ve been using the calculator as well, but I didn&#39;t allow to  <br/>\n&gt; use it unless for checking the results, but we&#39;ll use it next time if  <br/>\n&gt; she wants to.. maybe she finds out very quickly that the same numbers  <br/>\n&gt; add up to the same results each time... or maybe she learns that  <br/>\n&gt; cheating doesn&#39;t help her :-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So thank you all for your advice!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Johanna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

It gives the impression that learning is &quot;there&quot; and held by only a few trained teachers.

Don&#39;t get me <br/>\n&gt; wrong, my kids are unschooled and the idea and lifestyle is grand.  <br/>\n&gt; But the label &quot;unschooling&quot; just doesn&#39;t fit in my mind.  <br/>\n&gt; (Unfortunaely sometimes in our world we have to use labels to <br/>\n&gt; explain what we mean.) If &quot;unschooling&quot; is actually a thing, then <br/>\n&gt; EVERYONE is an unschooler, even those who use traditional school.  <br/>\n&gt; They just aren&#39;t getting all the great benefits that people with <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;unschooling&quot; mindset get.   What you are doing with your child <br/>\n&gt; right now, while she is still in school, is what many parents <br/>\n&gt; (certainly not as many as I would like to see) do everyday.  Whether <br/>\n&gt; they send their kids to school or don&#39;t.  You are parenting <br/>\n&gt; respectfully.  You are treating your child as an equal human being <br/>\n&gt; with less life experience than yourself.   At least that is what I <br/>\n&gt; think you mean when you say &quot;radically unschooling&quot;.  So, no if I <br/>\n&gt; were in your shoes, I wouldn&#39;t stop what you are doing.  I would, if <br/>\n&gt; necessary, explain to her that if it were up to you she wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have to go to school if she didn&#39;t want to. (I wouldn&#39;t do this <br/>\n&gt; unless she asks or you find another reason it is necessary only <br/>\n&gt; because it could be hard for her to understand...maybe not though.  <br/>\n&gt; Only you can answer that.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I know you wouldn&#39;t send your children to  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; school in the first place � but maybe you still have some <br/>\n&gt; creative  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ideas on how to deal with our problem. My daughter is 7 in the <br/>\n&gt; 2nd  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; year - &quot;school&quot; is not really the problem, because she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; question it (yet), she knows it has to be and likes it (partly). <br/>\n&gt; But  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; homework is horrible. She cries sometimes (especially math)... <br/>\n&gt; she  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; gets so frustrated and I really don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I would!! If they wanted to go.  Traditional forms of school are <br/>\n&gt; just ANOTHER tool for learning.  I just wouldn&#39;t put the same <br/>\n&gt; emphasis on school as many (almost all) parents would. I would go to <br/>\n&gt; school myself if I felt a need for it, and if they gave me <br/>\n&gt; information I didn&#39;t see a need for, I would let it go in one ear <br/>\n&gt; and out the other.  I may use some of the information given, and not <br/>\n&gt; use some.  I would allow my children the freedom to do the same if <br/>\n&gt; they decided they wanted the experience of traditional school or <br/>\n&gt; even just wanted to take one class.  School isn&#39;t really the problem <br/>\n&gt; in my eyes.  It&#39;s the way children are treated in regard to school.  <br/>\n&gt; It isn&#39;t allowed to be a place where one might go and learn from <br/>\n&gt; someone who is knowledgable in a certain area (the teacher) as it <br/>\n&gt; would be for you and I as adults.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I understand you are in a difficult position because your parenting <br/>\n&gt; ability could be questioned by the school.  However, I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\n&gt; YOUR child would be the ONLY child that has had slipping grades. <br/>\n&gt; What happens to parents that just can&#39;t make their kids do their <br/>\n&gt; homework?

Since I  <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t seem to keep track who is who here, I guess you cannot know who  <br/>\n&gt; I was... so I&#39;ll state again in what situation we live in: we are  <br/>\n&gt; from Germany and cannot unschool radically. It is illegal to not send  <br/>\n&gt; your kids to school here, so we have to stick with that. We have been  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; as good as possible then, for three weeks with  <br/>\n&gt; incredible results and we are all loving it. But of course, we have  <br/>\n&gt; one problem: School. So I know you wouldn&#39;t send your children to  <br/>\n&gt; school in the first place � but maybe you still have some creative  <br/>\n&gt; ideas on how to deal with our problem. My daughter is 7 in the 2nd  <br/>\n&gt; year - &quot;school&quot; is not really the problem, because she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; question it (yet), she knows it has to be and likes it (partly). But  <br/>\n&gt; homework is horrible. She cries sometimes (especially math)... she  <br/>\n&gt; gets so frustrated and I really don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Options I&#39;ve thought about:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; a) telling her she doesn&#39;t need to do them and I&#39;d support her if the  <br/>\n&gt; teachers don&#39;t understand, letting her really freedom to choose  <br/>\n&gt; whether or not to do them - but since she has to hold some standart,  <br/>\n&gt; or else they will start wondering and calling youth offices and stuff  <br/>\n&gt; if she starts getting bad grades.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; b) telling her she has to do them, try to force her to do them as  <br/>\n&gt; quickly as possible so she has lots of time afterwards, kind of  <br/>\n&gt; seeing it as a part of school which is unavoidable anyway and so keep  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;schooling&quot; until she is done with that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; c) doing them myself, or helping her a lot giving her the results if  <br/>\n&gt; she needs them (that would come close to supporting as much as  <br/>\n&gt; possible � I feel like she would be very grateful for this and really  <br/>\n&gt; feel that I want to help her - but she still has to learn it for  <br/>\n&gt; school. aaah! if she shows perfect homework and then doesn&#39;t knwo  <br/>\n&gt; what they are talking about in school, it might seem strange for them  <br/>\n&gt; and she could be in trouble...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know this is hard, but maybe you have some tiny small ideas! I&#39;ve  <br/>\n&gt; read many times that children going to school need to destress all  <br/>\n&gt; afternoon and so on � she kind of needs it too, it&#39;s a shame she  <br/>\n&gt; cannot unfold as much as she could :-( We&#39;ve implemented the ideas of  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling very well in the rest of our parenting and lifestyle and  <br/>\n&gt; it is really working out well. I wished I could do better for her...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please don&#39;t tell me to move to a place where we can unschool (cause  <br/>\n&gt; this is a plan but just not possible at the moment) or to fight the  <br/>\n&gt; law by going to court and so on (because this is expensive, doesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; really help and is stressful to everbody. Not even homeschoolers with  <br/>\n&gt; a curriculum win those, it&#39;s really hard in Germany). I really hope  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m still doing the right thing, maybe some of you think I shouldn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; do any part of unschooling if I cannot do it completely, cause it  <br/>\n&gt; will screw up both of the systems? sigh... I was trying to think I  <br/>\n&gt; should do the best I can - now I&#39;m wondering if this can really work.  <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling and going to school really doesn&#39;t seem to fit together.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; greetings<br/>\n&gt; Johanna<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

If she would suddenly drop grades it  <br/>\nwould be kind of &quot;suspicious&quot; I think – the teacher really likes her  <br/>\nand she would probably instantly ask if something is wrong at home  <br/>\netc. It would be awkward if she suddenly told at school that at home,  <br/>\nher mother tells her she &quot;doesn&#39;t have to do&quot; homework or something  <br/>\nlike that.

He spent about 4 hours yesterday trying NOT to do his homework. It&#39;s not that he has trouble understanding the stuff, but he says it&#39;s so boring... I need to talk to someone at school and see what they can do... either give him some more challenging work to do or find a different approach to teaching him. Part of the problem is that he&#39;s not SHOWING that he can do the work because he&#39;s resisting it so much...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know better now, different approach: let him learn at his own pace...these days he busies himself with bead jewelry projects, programming on the computer, reading and sometimes he just stares into space... thinking? absorbing? resting? not looking at anything in particular... whatever kids do... I remember doing something along those lines when I was younger.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to his teacher was a waste of time...the jist of it was that we HAD to MAKE him do his work or he&#39;d fail... he did manage to pretty much get all A&#39;s... almost always at the last minute for some things...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had some problems with his brothers re: homework to a lesser degree... at the school the boys went to, they gave homework 2 or 3x week in KINDERGARTEN...can you say insane?? They didn&#39;t call it &quot;homework&quot; but parent-child learning or somesuch oddness... Was 4x week from 1st grade on... (and from 3rd grade on, all homework & schoolwork was tied to the school&#39;s precious achievement tests...teaching To The Test in other words, ugh..that was one of the reasons I pulled the boys, the other was we hardly saw our then-7 yo because he would come home & be asleep within an hour of returning home & wake up in time to go to school)...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the boys had handwriting problems and his teacher was making him stay in at recess to practice it...I didn&#39;t know that, else I would have had a MAJOR fit... at the time I was concerned about handwriting but not to the point of traumatizing my kid over it.. ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad they&#39;re out of that environment...this is our 2nd &quot;year&quot;.. (or rather they&#39;ve been out of public school for 15 months now)... we started with something of a curriculum (Robinson Curriculum which is set up for them to teach themselves) but we found out pretty quick that we didn&#39;t want to do schoolwork patrol... it was more than that, though: why pull them from school to do more or less the same stuff they&#39;d do IN school? We still have a workbook or two in case anyone wants to use it and sometimes my almost-9 year old does...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The main reason that i pulled him was<br/>\n&gt; homework he refused to do it. When he was young he had the same issue<br/>\n&gt; with it. I did everything to make the homework go smoothly (Ha ha). I<br/>\n&gt; said frig it. What happen was the school made him stay in  at recess.<br/>\n&gt; Then when he got older they had the after school program.

What you are doing with your child <br/>\nright now, while she is still in school, is what many parents <br/>\n(certainly not as many as I would like to see) do everyday.  Whether <br/>\nthey send their kids to school or don&#39;t.  You are parenting <br/>\nrespectfully.  You are treating your child as an equal human being <br/>\nwith less life experience than yourself.   At least that is what I <br/>\nthink you mean when you say &quot;radically unschooling&quot;.  So, no if I <br/>\nwere in your shoes, I wouldn&#39;t stop what you are doing.  I would, if <br/>\nnecessary, explain to her that if it were up to you she wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to go to school if she didn&#39;t want to. (I wouldn&#39;t do this <br/>\nunless she asks or you find another reason it is necessary only <br/>\nbecause it could be hard for her to understand...maybe not though.  <br/>\nOnly you can answer that.) <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I know you wouldn&#39;t send your children to  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; school in the first place  but maybe you still have some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>creative  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ideas on how to deal with our problem.

She cries sometimes (especially math)... <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; gets so frustrated and I really don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But I would!! If they wanted to go.  Traditional forms of school are <br/>\njust ANOTHER tool for learning.  I just wouldn&#39;t put the same <br/>\nemphasis on school as many (almost all) parents would. I would go to <br/>\nschool myself if I felt a need for it, and if they gave me <br/>\ninformation I didn&#39;t see a need for, I would let it go in one ear <br/>\nand out the other.  I may use some of the information given, and not <br/>\nuse some.  I would allow my children the freedom to do the same if <br/>\nthey decided they wanted the experience of traditional school or <br/>\neven just wanted to take one class.  School isn&#39;t really the problem <br/>\nin my eyes.  It&#39;s the way children are treated in regard to school.  <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t allowed to be a place where one might go and learn from <br/>\nsomeone who is knowledgable in a certain area (the teacher) as it <br/>\nwould be for you and I as adults.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand you are in a difficult position because your parenting <br/>\nability could be questioned by the school.  However, I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nYOUR child would be the ONLY child that has had slipping grades. <br/>\nWhat happens to parents that just can&#39;t make their kids do their <br/>\nhomework?  I never did my homework, rarely went to school for that <br/>\nmatter when I was in Junior High and High School.  My mom tried <br/>\nto &quot;make&quot; me.  It didn&#39;t work.  I only did what I felt necessary or <br/>\ninteresting.  Don&#39;t make her.  Help her if SHE wants to do it, and <br/>\nmake sure she knows YOU think it&#39;s ok if she doesn&#39;t get it.  You <br/>\nare her biggest advocate, supporter and influence.  If you don&#39;t put <br/>\nthe same kind of emphasis on &quot;school&quot; as you do on just learning <br/>\nnaturally, she probably wont either.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I saw in a previous post that you were going to be moving in <br/>\nthe future (a couple of years?) to a place where homeschooling was <br/>\nlegal?  Maybe that was someone else though...but either way, if I <br/>\nwere you, I would just keep moving toward that goal.  Keep parenting <br/>\nrespectfully. Keep learning through life.  That&#39;s all we are all <br/>\ndoing anyway.  Just let her &quot;school&quot; experience be another tool in <br/>\nher learning toolbox.    <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck! <br/>\n<br/>\nLynda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217204862,"authorName":"Misty","from":"&quot;Misty&quot; &lt;misty@...&gt;","profile":"mistyfelner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling and school","postDate":"1158296254","msgId":17211,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVlZGJydStmNnJkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU5QTlGMzdELUM5MDQtNDdEQy1BMjFFLTU4MUQ1MTdCQjkxMUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17210,"nextInTopic":17212,"prevInTime":17210,"nextInTime":17212,"topicId":17203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... she ...

As <br/>\na teacher I had a parent tell me that one spelling homework I used <br/>\nto assign weekly greatly frustrated her son and that he would spend <br/>\nsometimes close to 2 hrs. trying to do it.

I recall as a <br/>\nteenager taking algebra not doing homework and my mom was called b/c <br/>\nmy average was I think a D almost entirely due to the homework <br/>\nissue.  (of course my mom&#39;s solution was to get a list of the <br/>\nhomework and keep me locked in the study everyday until it was all <br/>\ncompleted, and of course the teacher gave me zero credit for it, so <br/>\nI still ended up with a C average).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could discuss with the teacher doing less homework if she <br/>\nassigns 20 problems maybe your dd could do 5.

What <br/>\na real gift you are giving!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I have to say that doing them yourself came to my mind <br/>\nbefore I even got to that part of your post.  I have a son, soon to <br/>\nbe 15, that was in public school up until this past April.  He <br/>\nstruggled so much when he was younger, and I actually did this.  <br/>\nThink about it.  If your daughter is sitting with you and you make <br/>\nit a positive, fun experience she IS learning...and SO MUCH more <br/>\nthan the school is actually trying to teach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times the homework given is SO repetitive.  Maybe she could <br/>\ndo a few, and you could do a few.  You could take turns.  I&#39;ve even <br/>\ngone as far as to make my handwriting look like theirs and write it <br/>\nmyself.  I have even had them dictate the answers to me and wrote a <br/>\nnote explaining that the child did the brain work, and I wrote the <br/>\nanswers.  I don&#39;t know if you could actually do that with your <br/>\nsystem, but it&#39;s been done in our home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter has you with her creating a beautiful experience <br/>\nshe has so much to gain.  There are many creative ways you could <br/>\napproach this.  You know what your daughter likes and both of your <br/>\nstrengths and weaknessess.  Draw on that.  Examples like using mud <br/>\nto write in or cereal to count those are great starting off points <br/>\nto get creative.  Talk with your daughter.  Get her input.
