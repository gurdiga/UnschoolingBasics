I am new to homeschooling<br/>\nin general (that is, keeping my kids out of schools), as well as<br/>\nunschooling.  I had an easier time coming to unschooling than my<br/>\nhusband did, esp. where it touches the rest of our lives.  I know my<br/>\nkids are too young for me to even worry about reporting, yet, but the<br/>\ntime felt right, to us, to consider schooling or not.  We are living<br/>\nin an area where we are already getting questions about what<br/>\npreschools we are looking at, and so forth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI came to unschooling by way of earning a teaching credential.  I<br/>\nspent about 3 semesters teaching in CA schools, and completed most of<br/>\nthe work for my credential. I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to commit to<br/>\nteaching, now that I knew what it was like in the classroom. <br/>\nGenerally speaking, I consider my teaching experience a positive one<br/>\n-- I didn&#39;t have many Problem Kids, but that is probably my own<br/>\npersonality and world view coming into play, to be honest.  I was<br/>\ncreative, I did everything I could for my students, and I know that<br/>\nmost of them appreciated my efforts.  More of them cried on my last<br/>\nday than I ever expected, and I went home wondering if I&#39;d made a<br/>\nmistake in walking away, after all.  Still, after only a year and a<br/>\nhalf, I was burnt out, emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last credential class, one in assessment, took me 3 years to<br/>\nfinish, and ultimately led me to decide to keep my own kids out of the<br/>\nSystem.  I tried to finish the work even after I had left my teaching<br/>\nposition.  I missed the students.  But over the course of trying<br/>\nseveral times to do the coursework, I detoured several times, looking<br/>\nfor ways I could reconcile Teaching with The Rest Of My Life.  I<br/>\ndetoured, investigating Montessori Method.  Some of the course<br/>\nreadings were actually from Alfie Kohn!  These readings were utimately<br/>\nwhat led me to decide against going back to teaching.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I am rambling, now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWendy McD</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77817828,"authorName":"LOWRIEK@aol.com","from":"LOWRIEK@...","profile":"nancylowrie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Another Intro","postDate":"1085978675","msgId":102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5NS4yYTY1MTBjMi4yZGVjMTIzM0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12132,"prevInTime":101,"nextInTime":103,"topicId":102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello all, my name is Nancy and I live in Prince George , BC, Canada.

Usually found nude with ice cream on her face, jumping on the trampoline, in the sandbox or checking the three elderly chickens for eggs.<br>\nWe live on 2 acres about 25 mins out of town, in&nbsp;&nbsp; a log house with 2 cats and one senile Schipperke. We have two horses, and the aforementioned chickens.<br>\nI will try not to get too chatty on the list, but am very isolated from like-minded individuals. I try to only lurk on Unschooling Discussion, because I really am not so sure I know what I am doing. So glad to come to this list.
