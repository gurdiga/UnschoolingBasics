Once we discovered the term for it, we came to <br/>\nmore information on radical unschooling and are currently devouring <br/>\neverything we can read on the topic and making gradual yet important <br/>\nchanges each day!  We hope to attend the NEU conference too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, as far as &#39;school&#39; we are great at unschooling and <br/>\nstrewing, we also have easily relaxed our limits on bedtimes, tv, <br/>\nfood and chores and are seeing the positive results. We have an 8 <br/>\nmonth old ds, 6 and 8 year old dd, and a 14 year old (my step son, <br/>\nalthough we have custody, his mom will not allow us to homeschool <br/>\nhim...on a side note, he received a detention the other day for <br/>\nbeing &quot;non productive in studyhall&quot; - he was reading a skateboarding <br/>\nmagazine, aarrgghh - but that is another topic for another place!)<br/>\nOur challenge is really more the smaller, yet important, daily <br/>\nfrustrations: sibling squabbles, meltdowns, and more importantly - <br/>\nmy frustration point being lower than I would like.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong post, so sorry, but I am getting to my question - really!
