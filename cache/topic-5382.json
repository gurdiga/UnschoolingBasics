I graduated high school in 1979 and <br/>\nwe had actual final exams in phys ed.

Some things, like gymnastics, had more <br/>\ninstruction and information along the way as we got to more and <br/>\ndifferent types of appartus. But, in younger years (1-6 grades), gym <br/>\nwas mostly for running and playing. Of course, back in my grammar <br/>\nschool days, we&#39;d wear &#39;hot pants&#39; (boy am I dating myself there lol!) <br/>\nunder our skirts so we could change for gym easily and then change <br/>\nback - jeans weren&#39;t allowed at all and I was in 5th grade by the <br/>\ntime &#39;pant suits&#39; were even allowed.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"scrapgal","from":"&quot;scrapgal&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Learning to play baseball","postDate":"1113170257","msgId":5382,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzYzdnaCtqbmRtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5383,"prevInTime":5381,"nextInTime":5383,"topicId":5382,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it was on this list that Ren posted something about how kids would hate to play baseball if it were taught like we teach history.

Instead of just experiencing baseball they are first <br/>\ntaught the history of baseball and then the positions and the key <br/>\nplayers in history then all the rules, etc. And *then* tested on how <br/>\nmuch they know about baseball instead of just experiencing the <br/>\ngame.  (Sound familiar?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was chatting with one of Emily&#39;s friends who is in middle <br/>\nschool and asked how school was going.  &quot;Fine.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are you doing anything exciting?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, we are studying softball in PE.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh really?  What position are you playing?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh we don&#39;t play softball.  We are just studying it right now.  YOu <br/>\nknow the rules and how it all got started.  That kind of stuff.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Are you actually going to get to *play* softball?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Maybe.  We have a test next week and then I guess we will play it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just floored.  It seemed so odd that Ren prophesied what is <br/>\ngoing on in our school systems.  The one class each day that kids <br/>\ncan &quot;play&quot; and they can&#39;t even play anymore.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - wondering if she can still hit a ball</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5378,"nextTopicId":5384}}
