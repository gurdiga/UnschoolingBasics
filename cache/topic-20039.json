Very few people in society know what respected children are  <br/>\nlike. They only know what controlled (and neglected) children are  <br/>\nlike. All the advice society hands out is about controlled and  <br/>\nneglected children, not respected children. So a lot of what we say  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make sense. Our advantage is that we *have* respected  <br/>\nchildren so we know how they behave. And since we&#39;ve discussed this  <br/>\nso much, because we trust ourselves to see our kids as who they are  <br/>\nrather than filtered through society&#39;s vision of them, we know why  <br/>\nthey&#39;re different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just feel that its my role as a parent to be there and<br/>\n&gt; help consider good choices<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As do we.

(Quite often doing things  <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot; (but really unconventionally!) is a more powerful way to  <br/>\nlearn than doing things right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that so much of what society fears will cause harm  <br/>\nto kids we know from experience just isn&#39;t true.<br/>\n<br/>\nControl and lost (parent) trust has caused much more damage than  <br/>\nvideo games ever will.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As we have limits on ourselves, so do they.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are real limits.

He only keeps as many as he can <br/>\ncare for and got angry at Cameron&#39;s girlfriend, who played with his DS <br/>\nand bought another dog---but then went home after the weekend, leaving <br/>\n*her* new dog for Duncan to care for. &quot;Doesn&#39;t she realize that a dog&#39;s <br/>\na big responsibility? That she can&#39;t just *get* one and then forget <br/>\nabout it?&quot; So he&#39;s *very* attached to and cares a lot about his virtual <br/>\npets.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he also realizes that these are just pixels.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow...I don&#39;t really know what a &quot;pixel&quot; IS, but I do know that they <br/>\naren&#39;t real dogs. &lt;g&gt; Nevertheless, the boy who was starving his <br/>\nvirtual dog had my stomach in a knot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was experimenting with the GAME.

I guess I *know* that in my mind, but my heart was breaking <br/>\nfor this starving pup...uh...pixel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many adults have a hard time understanding that these are <br/>\nsimply games---NO ONE is getting hurt---not a soul! Nor would these <br/>\nchildren purposefully harm anyone IRL. But this a VIRTUAL world. Wild <br/>\nand crazy things can be done in a virtual world---things none of these <br/>\nchildren would ever *consider* doing in real life! They can be strong <br/>\nsuper-heroes and super-villains. They can starve sweet, little pups. <br/>\nThey can save and destroy planets. It&#39;s a GAME! Absolutley NO violence <br/>\nis being committed! Absolutely NO damage is being done!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent trivializes what a child holds dear or throws away or <br/>\nsells a child&#39;s game or denies a child time to play...then REAL damage <br/>\nis being done to that child and that relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe *parent* has the power over the child and is wielding it to suit <br/>\nthe parent. A child feels small and powerless. THAT&#39;s real damage! A <br/>\nparent that spanks or pops or smacks or paddles or whips a <br/>\nchild---THAT&#39;s real violence!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the children that DO play violent games and then go out and <br/>\nshoot up a school?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that those children were loved and accepted for Who They <br/>\nAre by everyone close to them? Or do you think they were laughed at and <br/>\nridiculed and coerced and denied and trumped on a regular basis? Do you <br/>\nthink they were trusted and respected and treasted with kindness and <br/>\npatience and generosity? Or do you think their parents wished they <br/>\ncould fix or change them---or just wish that they were *different*?<br/>\n<br/>\nColumbine shooters don&#39;t get that way because they were allowed to play <br/>\nvideo games. They get that way because the people who should have loved <br/>\nthem most didn&#39;t treat them with respect and kindness and accept that <br/>\nWho They Are was good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve met almost all the kids whose parents write here regularly. Not an <br/>\naxe-murderer among them! &lt;G&gt; Gentle, kind, thoughtful kids who love to <br/>\nkill and starve pixels. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Might over Right will get you short-term results. Using Right <br/>\nover Might takes a little longer---more thought, more patience, more <br/>\nwork!---but it&#39;s a life-long relationship you&#39;re after, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games don&#39;t cause violent children.

My boys are 10 and 13 and  have <br/>\nnever had controls placed on them.  I can tell you that working out  solutions to <br/>\nproblems that arise is a valuable tool.  At first when they  would argue about <br/>\nwho played first or for how long, I would mediate a little, to  first calm <br/>\nthe situation, then talk about what exactly each person wants.   Then we would <br/>\nstart throwing out solutions for the problem until we hit on one  that everyone <br/>\nwas happy with.  So those types of &quot;problems&quot; can be worked  out in a <br/>\nmutually agreeable way.  Now they are very good at working out  agreeable solutions <br/>\nwithout my help.  It works for 2 boys and when the boys  have friends over they <br/>\nwork out solutions that are agreeable to 3 or 4  boys.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nI am not sure if I had removed the game system when a  problem arose that <br/>\nwould have helped them learn problem solving tools.  I  am not a &quot;gaming&quot; person <br/>\nmyself.  But dh is, and the game systems are a way  for him to reconnect with <br/>\nthe boys at the end of his work day.  So it has  worked out in a very positive <br/>\nway for our family as a whole as well as leading  to lots of interesting <br/>\ntangents for the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPam  G<br/>\n<br/>\nOur Blogs:<br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)\">http://ourgreenerpastures.blogspot.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255297978,"authorName":"Dawn Bennink","from":"&quot;Dawn Bennink&quot; &lt;bennink4@...&gt;","profile":"mhbmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: video games","postDate":"1167348395","msgId":20076,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMTgwMWM3MmFkNyRhMTdiMzUxMCQwYTAwYThjMEBCTFNDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVuMG5wNitmODA1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20054,"nextInTopic":27523,"prevInTime":20075,"nextInTime":20077,"topicId":20039,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**** I didn t think til later to explain that since we homeschool, we are together almost 24/7 and have plenty of conversation. **** That how I feel about","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1409060834\">**** I didn&#39;t think til later to explain that since we homeschool, we are <br/>\ntogether almost 24/7 and have plenty of conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n**** That how I feel about &quot;family sit-down dinners&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot long ago my boys saw one of the commercials for &quot;the family table.&quot;  My <br/>\n6yo ds said, &quot;We don&#39;t always sit down and have a family table dinner. <br/>\nDaddy is working at dinner a lot.
