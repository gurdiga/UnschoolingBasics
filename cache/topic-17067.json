He is a full-time realtor and I work<br/>\npart-time for MAC cosmetics as a makeup artist. I also freelance jobs<br/>\non the side occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve worked around each other&#39;s schedules for the last few years. <br/>\nOccasionally, our older children would watch the younger one&#39; during<br/>\nany  gap in our schedules. I don&#39;t like asking them to babysit, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen very often.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ages of my children really affects my ability to work....having<br/>\nolder kids has helped make it possible. I love my work, but it does<br/>\nget hectic to work around each other consistently. In the past it was<br/>\npretty easy for dh to flow around my schedule (he ran his own decking<br/>\ncompany in Pensacola) but now that he&#39;s doing realty, it&#39;s going to<br/>\nget challenging. I can&#39;t count on him to always be here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...it&#39;s probably good that as he&#39;s starting to get busier, I&#39;m going<br/>\nback to 12 hours per week. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is, it can work out just fine with a little creativity and<br/>\nperseverance.:)  One of our best friends is a single mum that started<br/>\nan internet business and is doing great with that.  There are creative<br/>\nways to make money and unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my work as it&#39;s a big part of creative expression for me. I get<br/>\npaid well for what I do and I meet a ton of interesting people. I&#39;d be<br/>\ndoing this even if I didn&#39;t get paid (though probably not for another<br/>\ncompany).<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17059,"nextTopicId":17026}}
