Have you never had a chance to attend a conference and have heard everyone <br/>\nsharing how much they loved the one that just past? Do you belong to unschooling yahoo <br/>\ngroups but don&#39;t have time to get on and read as much as you would like since you are <br/>\nbusy doing other things with your family? Would you like to know about other types of <br/>\nconferences where there will be at least one speaker who will be talking about <br/>\nunschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is one place where all statewide and larger unschooling conferences, gatherings, <br/>\nspeakers and events can be posted so that those of us who would like to &quot;ride the circuit&quot; <br/>\ncan easily find which ones are coming up. This includes anything from statewide to <br/>\ninternational. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis particular yahoo group is not covering local unschooling groups. For local get-<br/>\ntogethers find a list for your local area.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you know of an unschooling conference, gathering, speaker or event that is not posted <br/>\nhere, please add it to our list! If you know of a different type of conference, gathering, <br/>\nspeaker or event not specifically related to unschooling but which you think other life <br/>\nlearners might also be interested in, please e-mail me so we can consider posting it here <br/>\nas well. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to meeting you on the journey,<br/>\nJoanne O&#39;N.<br/>\ndh: Charlie<br/>\nds: Kevin (7)<br/>\nhb: Terlingua, TX<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:seagullcaller@...\">seagullcaller@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGroup Email Addresses<br/>\nPost message:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingcircuitriders@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingcircuitriders@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubscribe:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingcircuitriders-subscribe@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingcircuitriders-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nUnsubscribe:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingcircuitriders-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingcircuitriders-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nList owner:\t<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingcircuitriders-owner@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingcircuitriders-owner@yahoogroups.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26093,"nextTopicId":26098}}
