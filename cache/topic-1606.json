That is a great idea.  I do have to <br/>\ncheck on them and usually just call a name and they answer because I <br/>\ncan&#39;t say I have ever made them come inside from playing.  lol!  My <br/>\nkids are pretty free to do what they want.  I have asked dd to tell <br/>\nme when she is going outside to play and why I need her to do that <br/>\nand she always does.  She is a very &quot;spirited&quot; child and has been <br/>\nsince birth.  (I am not into labels-this is just the only way to give <br/>\nyou an idea of her personallity.)  <br/>\nDD really can and does rub people the wrong way A LOT.  To the point <br/>\nwhere they don&#39;t want to be bothered with her.  This makes me very <br/>\nsad for her and I don&#39;t know what to do about it.  She also acts out <br/>\nwhen this happens.  We are dealing with this right now. Her older <br/>\nsister and her boyfriend just moved on our property (a very temporary <br/>\nsituation) and her boyfriend treats the 2 yr old dd (Heather) all <br/>\nsweet and he pushes 6 yr old dd (Spring) away.  And even when he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t, you can tell from his stiff body language that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant her near him.  Spring can &quot;feel&quot; this.  Everyone can.  My mother <br/>\ndoes the same thing, so when she visits life is horrible.  Spring is <br/>\nout of control the whole time her grandmother is here.  (Not saying <br/>\nwe control her-it is her own actions that become out of control.)  My <br/>\nloving child becomes a monster!  <br/>\nI have my home set up child friendly.  Which means that they <br/>\nbasically have total freedom.  If they are hungry they can reach <br/>\nfoods to eat and don&#39;t have to ask-though I have tried to get them to <br/>\nlet me know they are hungry in case it is almost dinner time and we <br/>\nwill be eating real soon (and I still tend to feed them a quick snack <br/>\nbecause they are hungry and shouldn&#39;t have to wait).  :)   <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions about how to handle this situation above with others <br/>\nnot wanting her near?  I am really lost on this one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect my kids to act &quot;right now&quot; unless it is a dangerous <br/>\nsituation.  They know they can say &quot;wait a minute&quot; just like we can <br/>\nif necessary.  Sometimes things do have to wait.  (Like when you are <br/>\nin the bathroom and they need something &quot;right now&quot;-lol!)  There are <br/>\ntimes in our family life when we all have to wait a minute or two for <br/>\nsomething.  We do try to meet all needs asap simply because it is  <br/>\nimportant no matter what age they are.  DH and I always try and make <br/>\nsure one of us is available to them at all times.  This can be <br/>\nchallenging when you are out rounding up a calf that has just gotten <br/>\nout of it&#39;s pen.  lol!  But we try.  Treating kids with respect is <br/>\nthe only way to go.

If we ignored our kid&#39;s needs and requests they would  <br/>\nfeel it as disrespectful.  IYKWIM.  Isn&#39;t it the same in  reverse?  <br/>\nHow do we teach them this?  Or is it something that is  just learned <br/>\nin time?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nQuestion is---have you ever ignored her requests &quot;to do it right NOW&quot;?  Maybe <br/>\nshe got that from you? <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it IS learned over time. They don&#39;t pop out respectful. They pop  out <br/>\nneedy. They will learn respect if they are respected. And how to be  <br/>\ndisrespectful if not respected.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have no idea how it worked for us. My children and my dogs: if I yell,  <br/>\n&quot;NO!&quot;----they all automatically stop and sit and stop whatever they were doing,  <br/>\nwhereever they are. They NEVER hear &quot;NO!&quot; unless it&#39;s an emergency. When I  <br/>\nscream, &quot;NOW!&quot;---they all come running to me. Again, I never yell &quot;NOW!&quot; unless  <br/>\nit&#39;s an emergency. I don&#39;t know what I did to reinforce this. I&#39;m guessing <br/>\nit&#39;s  all in the tone of voice and the look of fear in my eyes: they KNOW I&#39;m  <br/>\nserious.<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe you could set up a scene where you talk about there being a bear or  <br/>\nsomething else scary nearby. This is what you&#39;d yell, and this is what she  <br/>\nshould do----run straight for you because you&#39;re scared for her life. <br/>\n <br/>\nI know a lot of Cameron&#39;s friends would not &quot;hear&quot; their moms call for  <br/>\nthem----thinking that they would be called in from playing outside and from  having <br/>\na good time. &quot;Selective&quot; hearing. I wanted to avoid that. I&#39;d call out  <br/>\n&quot;Cameron Check!&quot;, and he&#39;s answer, &quot;Mommy Check!&quot;  And vice versa: if he  needed to <br/>\nknow where I was, he could call out, &quot;Mommy Check!&quot; and I&#39;d answer,  &quot;Cameron <br/>\nCheck!&quot; All that was was a way for each of us to know that the other  was <br/>\nnearby. I never used it to find him to tell him it was time to go or to stop  him <br/>\nfrom playing. It was just a &quot;check&quot;----to make sure he was close.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think if there were bears in my yard, I would let her know in NO  uncertain <br/>\nterms that she needs to come when I call. That&#39;s not open for  debate. I <br/>\nthink my children need to come when I call at all times, but  at the same time, <br/>\nthey KNOW I won&#39;t call them unless it&#39;s important.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat looks funny when I read back what I wrote. But they KNOW when I NEED  <br/>\nthem to do what I say when I use that tone of voice. They never ask questions  <br/>\nwhen they hear that tone.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":125789604,"authorName":"Onesnotenough@aol.com","from":"Onesnotenough@...","profile":"justlikemama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: gentler way of talking to kids AND an added quest...","postDate":"1089336216","msgId":1606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliLjRhMWQ5MzJiLjJlMWY0ZDk4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1721,"prevInTime":1605,"nextInTime":1607,"topicId":1606,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/8/2004 5:29:31 PM Central Daylight Time, earthmothergypsy@hotmail.com writes: BEAR is  in the yard!!!!!!
