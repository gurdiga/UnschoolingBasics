I have <br/>\nprinted them out and have highlighted many bits to think about and <br/>\nwork on. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral of you questioned whether there is stuff from the past to do <br/>\nwith control and power struggles getting in the way. I developed some <br/>\nawareness that this is the case after a huge argument with DH a while <br/>\nago about a chicken. We were having supper of some leftover chicken <br/>\n(not as much as we would have liked) and I got annoyed that DH was <br/>\ngiving most of it to DS1. My position was that it was spoiling him <br/>\nand he would learn to be selfish etc etc. Talking later we were able <br/>\nto connect this to our mothers. DH&#39;s mother always gave her children <br/>\nthe best she could even if it meant she went without (and this was in <br/>\ncommunist Poland when times were very hard). I, of course, was <br/>\nfollowing my mother&#39;s way. It honestly didn&#39;t ever occur to me until <br/>\nthis unschooling path that my mother could have been wrong about such <br/>\nthings. It was so ingrained in me. She believed that it you give them <br/>\nan inch they take a mile. You train kids and if you take your eye off <br/>\nthe ball they&#39;ll turn out bad. She didn&#39;t see why she should ever <br/>\nshortchange herself. She lives very defensively and is always on <br/>\nguard against being taken advantage of. And I learnt that from. That <br/>\nchicken argument really woke me up. Not only did I totally get it but <br/>\nmy respect for my DH and my MIL shot up too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI realise I still have a lot of work to do in this area. I am <br/>\nbeginning to see the depth and breadth of the control and coercion my <br/>\nmother exerted in my childhood home. It shakes my sense of her and of <br/>\nmy childhood to see these things. A good example is church <br/>\nattendance. I was raised Catholic, and this means I was baptised as <br/>\nan infant, made my first confession at six, first communion at seven <br/>\nand was due to be confirmed at twelve. I put my foot down (and I <br/>\nrarely stood up to my mother) and told her that the meaning of <br/>\nconfirmation was that I was confirming to the Church that I accepted <br/>\nit MYSELF, and that I couldn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t believe in it. I have <br/>\nalways held that my mother was respectful of me because she agreed, <br/>\nand didn&#39;t make me get confirmed into Catholicism. But I now think <br/>\ndeeper and ask, why then did she make me go to mass every week for <br/>\nanother FOUR years until I was 16?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while trying to maintain my good relationship with my mother I <br/>\nmust reject a lot of what I learnt from her. It is painful to realise <br/>\nthat in order to parent in a way I believe is best for my children I <br/>\nmust do it very differently from her. It makes me sad for my `child <br/>\nself&#39; too. However, I feel very positive for my `mother self&#39; that I <br/>\nhave some very good guidance as to the most important work I have to <br/>\ndo now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all again<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nwith DS1 (6) and DS2 (3)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You feel like he&#39;s laughing at your helplessness because you can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; control him.

Yes and no are <br/>\nnot unconditional... there are reasons to say no but if you loose your <br/>\ncool you are giving them power. If they are used to taking your power <br/>\nthis will get worse before it gets better. My DH has some anger issues <br/>\nand he can loose his cool with our DD 3 3/4 y.o. I often have to <br/>\nintervene and let her know that Dad is not going to get angry and if she <br/>\nneeds attention she can have a hug or get a book and Dadddy will read to <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my kids wanted to play in the street I would tell them no and we <br/>\nwould talk about why.

Attachment <br/>\nparents help their children explore their world but there is a <br/>\ndifference to doing something to get attention and exploring their <br/>\nworld. My DD will do things that get her attention because she wants it <br/>\nall the time. This is normal she is almost 4.

There is the everyday and no day is the same - it <br/>\nwould be easier if it was but that would not be unschooling. If you can <br/>\ntake a day for yourself. Get out of the house, go to a movie, go to a <br/>\nbookstore, go somewhere with a friend, go shopping, go dancing, do <br/>\nsomething without the kids - just for you. This is very hard for me and <br/>\nit only happens probably once a month but I do also take mini breaks <br/>\ntoo. A shower, a chapter in a book, a walk in the yard sometimes it is <br/>\nwith one of the kids but I really try to get at least 15 minutes to <br/>\nmyself all by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they want to see in the oven - say &quot;oh you want to see in the oven?&quot; <br/>\nWalk over to the oven open it up or if the child already has, get down <br/>\non their level and look in the oven. What do you know about ovens? Is <br/>\nyours electric or gas? What are the dangers of electric, gas and high <br/>\nheat? Make it a learning oppurtunity. Show that it doesn&#39;t bother you <br/>\nthat they are curious about everything. No slashing in the town square? <br/>\nTry an exchange. &quot;The town doesn&#39;t want us to spash people here but we <br/>\ncan go home and splash water at home.&quot; The frig door, lights or water <br/>\ngetting left on? Do a unit or watch a program on conservation/green <br/>\nliving. There are lots of fun ways to guide your children to responsible <br/>\nliving and being good citizens. Try and turn no into yes.

If you let go a little you will have a little peace; <br/>\nif<br/>\nyou let go a lot you will have a lot of peace; if you let go completely <br/>\nyou<br/>\nwill have complete peace. *<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can come to wholelife unschooling with the thought that it&#39;s just <br/>\nlike<br/>\nauthoritarian parenting except that parents say &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;no.&quot;  <br/>\nAs<br/>\nthough it were another 1-2-3 method.  It&#39;s not.  Authoritarian parents <br/>\nnever<br/>\nneed a reason for saying no.  Parents who are unschooling are choosing <br/>\nto<br/>\nunderstand and talk about why they&#39;re saying &quot;yes&quot; and why they&#39;re <br/>\nsaying<br/>\n&quot;no.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn 8/29/08, almadoing &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:almadoing@...\">almadoing@...</a> <br/>\n&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:almadoing@...\">almadoing@...</a>&gt;   &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:almadoing@...\">almadoing@...</a>&gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    We have been moving into unschooling for more than a year now but I<br/>\n&gt; am feeling very discouraged.

The other day we were out and my children were playing in<br/>\n&gt; the fountain (not disallowed by the town). DS1 (6) was deliberately<br/>\n&gt; splashing passers by. When I approached the fountain and called his<br/>\n&gt; name to come and talk to me he ran away laughing. I felt so out of<br/>\n&gt; control and helpless I just wept. Later when I talked about it with<br/>\n&gt; him he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell<br/>\n&gt; him off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things that should feel positive just don&#39;t. Instead of cooking three<br/>\n&gt; meals a day I am always preparing snacks and different meals for<br/>\n&gt; everyone. Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the<br/>\n&gt; children are still up beyond my saturation point.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful � I am<br/>\n&gt; doing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough � it<br/>\n&gt; feels like I can never satisfy them. And however much I am trying to<br/>\n&gt; respect their own autonomy they do not respect (OK � obey) the things<br/>\n&gt; I do ask.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am finding it very hard to justify to others (eg my mother) my move<br/>\n&gt; towards unschooling because it does not seem to be making my family<br/>\n&gt; any happier. DH is on board but feels much the same as me. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or<br/>\n&gt; good enough to offer our children this lifestyle.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can hear the negativity in my voice, and I am so churned up to have<br/>\n&gt; to admit this, but I feel far from living joyfully.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where am I going wrong?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Alison<br/>\n&gt; With DS1 (6) and DS2 (3)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Still shouting, still feeling overwhelmed, still not experiencing the environment I believe is possible for our home.  Katherine said that it can take years to learn to parent well, but I feel like I don&#39;t have years.  My girls are 3 1/2, almost 4, and I feel like I&#39;m on the clock to get it better NOW.  <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------<br/>\nAbsolutely, you don&#39;t have years. I think it is a good thing to realize. It is a finite period of time that you are working with. Sandra Dodd makes a wonderful suggestion of making the better choice in any given decision. Don&#39;t worry so much about the best choice, but the better choice is worth worrying over. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy\">http://sandradodd.com/peace/noisy</a> is really worth reading. While you are at it read here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully,\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully,</a> as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Linnaea got really upset at David. I spent 2 hours just being with her while she worked through that upset. It was a long time and it was important for me not to get agitated or press her to find a better feeling right now. And when I did feel myself growing agitated, or cold, we were outside on a cool British evening for much of the time, I had to breathe through and let it be her upset, not mine. When she was done she was done. 2 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have been able to make it as capably as I was last night. 2 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have had the patience. I didn&#39;t get the patience overnight, but it grew, every day it grew.  My patience is the product of a series of better choices. And because of that, in that whole 2 hours of being upset Linnaea didn&#39;t say anything hurtful about herself or about me or about David, she didn&#39;t hit or bite or do anything physical to me. Part of that is about growing up, but more of that is about me choosing the<br/>\n better path of two repeatedly. It means that she feels safer and more respected and less like she needs to make big statements to feel that she is being heard. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee it as changing the way you respond the next time. Don&#39;t see it as fixing yourself for all the times.

That&#39;s one of the reasons it&#39;s hard to keep up<br/>\nwith.  You are changing by learning (hopefully) and so are your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My girls are 3 1/2, almost 4, and I feel like I&#39;m on the clock to get it<br/>\n&gt; better NOW.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If it could happen in a second, there wouldn&#39;t be so many people who stay on<br/>\nthese lists for years.  The key is to keep on learning more.  If you&#39;re<br/>\nhoping for automatic pilot, that&#39;s not what relationships are about.<br/>\nBecause when you think you&#39;ve got it, your child/ren go through other stages<br/>\nand develop other needs to be met. And there we are again, having other<br/>\nthings we want to know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add that it does become a lot more fun and developing a new<br/>\nsense of how to make life fun is a big part of what unschooling is about.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Still too many &quot;no&quot;s","postDate":"1220030295","msgId":35610,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1NUY0Rjg1LUIzMDktNDM5OS1CODA3LTkyNzY5Qzc5NTc2NkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5OHEybytsM2oxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc5OHEybytsM2oxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35609,"nextInTopic":35611,"prevInTime":35609,"nextInTime":35611,"topicId":35603,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think you need to learn the arts of overlooking, redirecting, and setting the stage. ...

If you have a  <br/>\nglass chandelier about to be destroyed &lt;G&gt;, then say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s  <br/>\nmarch out the door with that. Hup two three four....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ·\tnot to touch the walls with paint on their hands<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Set the stage so that there isn&#39;t much likelihood of them wandering  <br/>\naround with paint on their hands.<br/>\nSet up painting activities outdoors - or in the bathtub (that&#39;s what I  <br/>\nused to do). If they are painting in the house, be right there to get  <br/>\nthings for them so they never need to get up. Or put stools up in  <br/>\nfront of the kitchen counter right next to the sink for them to sit  <br/>\nand paint. Kitchens and bathroom walls and cabinets are made to be  <br/>\nwashed off - so a little paint won&#39;t hurt them - you just wipe them  <br/>\noff. Mine sat on the kitchen floor for messy activities - and we have  <br/>\na small narrow kitchen.

Put a lot of towels on the floor. We used our tub for a lot  <br/>\nof fun - make it possible for them to slosh a lot. That&#39;s a sweet gift  <br/>\n- water play is SO good! Take pictures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ·\tnot to open the oven door<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Help them open it safely - I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re curious. Encourage that.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ·\tnot to leave the fridge door open<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just shut it. If you start nagging about that now, you&#39;ll still be  <br/>\ndoing it in 15 years. Save yourself 15 years of nagging and just know  <br/>\nthat it will once in a while get left open. That&#39;s life. Get over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; ·\tnot to hit<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Help them with the specific problem. Help them find alternative ways  <br/>\nto resolve problems. Don&#39;t talk about it too much - I get the feeling  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve already learned to tune you out, anyway. Use few words and  <br/>\nconfident, easy actions. One kid is in the process of hitting another?  <br/>\nStep in, wrap your arms around him as firmly as you have to and as  <br/>\ngently as you can and say, &quot;Hey, sweetie, what&#39;s the deal?&quot; LISTEN to  <br/>\nthe hitter - he is frustrated to the point of hitting.

You can develop your positivity by reframing  <br/>\nyour thinking - what &quot;CAN&quot; we do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DS1 (6) was deliberately  splashing passers by.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Children playing in a fountain and people were passing nearby and not  <br/>\nexpecting to get splashed?

I doubt that very much. He&#39;s a kid - he&#39;s having fun.<br/>\nBut, you&#39;re thinking in terms of who is in control, who has power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I felt so out of<br/>\n&gt; control and helpless I just wept.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote the above before I read the next line - so it IS about how you  <br/>\nfeel out of control and helpless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Later when I talked about it with<br/>\n&gt; him he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell<br/>\n&gt; him off.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course. He knows when you call his name like that that he&#39;s &quot;in  <br/>\ntrouble.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to set up their world for them to be successful so  <br/>\nthey can&#39;t get &quot;in trouble.&quot; That is my suggestion to you - to think  <br/>\nabout how to do that.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things that should feel positive just don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Should should should.

REVEL in the grazing - change your way of thinking  <br/>\nabout cooking and food. Plan ahead for the family to graze on the good  <br/>\nstuff you&#39;ve prepared. Make what they like and have it ready when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re ready for it. The point is to have good (healthy and good- <br/>\ntasting enjoyable) foods, right? There is nothing sacred about three  <br/>\nmeals per day - it isn&#39;t even the healthiest way to eat. Don&#39;t just  <br/>\nlet it go - get INTO the alternatives. Figure out how to do this -  <br/>\ngood practice at being creative and thinking outside the box.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the  children are  <br/>\n&gt; still up beyond my saturation point.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids their age can be exhausting - that&#39;s reality. instead of thinking  <br/>\nof evenings as your recharging time, and resenting it that you&#39;re not  <br/>\ngetting that time, focus on getting chances to recharge your own  <br/>\nbatteries at other times - especially times that INCLUDE the kids!  <br/>\nWatch a movie - watch some silly tv show. Get into the fountain WITH  <br/>\nthem (okay - it is in public, maybe that&#39;s too undignified for you -  <br/>\nbut go to a pool, instead). Read good books aloud. Cuddle. Also - take  <br/>\n1-minute vacations. Focus on those couple of minutes you get to  <br/>\nyourself throughout the day - there are many more of them than you  <br/>\nthink, but you&#39;re ignoring them because they&#39;re so short. Instead -  <br/>\npay attention and spend 30 seconds deep breathing. Wash your face with  <br/>\nsomething that smells really good. Put some really nice hand lotion at  <br/>\nthe sink - you can massage your own hands and arms for 30 seconds. I  <br/>\nlike the Body Splash that they sell at Bath and Body Works - I spray  <br/>\nit sort of into the hair in my direction and stand in the mist for a  <br/>\nsecond or two. Refreshing moment. Have a glass of cold water - enjoy  <br/>\nit, savor it. In other words, take care of yourself in the little  <br/>\nmoments between other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful – I am<br/>\n&gt; doing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough – it<br/>\n&gt; feels like I can never satisfy them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You have an idea in your head of what them being satisfied would look  <br/>\nlike, I suppose. And the resentment is that they aren&#39;t getting with  <br/>\nthe program (YOUR program). You&#39;re doing your part - they&#39;re not  <br/>\nresponding like they are supposed to, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And however much I am trying to respect their own autonomy they do  <br/>\n&gt; not respect (OK – obey) the things I do ask.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wish I could put a pair of glasses on you that would let you &quot;see&quot;  <br/>\nfrom a different perspective. It is like you&#39;re currently looking  <br/>\nthrough lenses that make the world look like it is filled with power  <br/>\nstruggles - you&#39;re &quot;seeing&quot; who is in control, who is being  <br/>\nrespectful, who is being obedient, who is in charge, who is running  <br/>\nthings, who is being listened to, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe try this mental/physical trick. Either do it physically, if  <br/>\npossible, or imagine doing it. Stand &quot;beside&quot; your child - facing the  <br/>\nsame direction. You are a team. You are NOT competitors or  <br/>\nadversaries. Physically stand next to each other - don&#39;t &quot;face off.&quot;  <br/>\nDon&#39;t look into his eyes - (I know - goes against conventional wisdom)  <br/>\n- glaring into someone&#39;s eyes is threatening and hostile.<br/>\n<br/>\nASSUME the child wants to feel good and that you want to support that.  <br/>\nAct like you KNOW it is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were splashing passersby, you were embarrassed and angry at  <br/>\nthem for not knowing better and making you seem like a bad parent. You  <br/>\nthought about what those passersby would be thinking about the parent  <br/>\nof those bratty children. And, maybe, you thought things like,  <br/>\n&quot;They&#39;re so unsocialized, rude, uncaring....what kind of people will  <br/>\nthey be when they grow up?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could you have thought/been different? I&#39;m not saying let them run  <br/>\nwild and be a big rude inconvenience to other people in the world. It  <br/>\nisn&#39;t a choice of that versus control them, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, instead, you were thinking, &quot;Wow, you guys are having SO much fun  <br/>\nin that fountain. We should come at a time when other people won&#39;t be  <br/>\ngoing by so you can splash as much as you want. I wonder when would be  <br/>\na good time? I wonder if there are other places to play in water like  <br/>\nthis? Maybe we should plan a trip to a water park? Or, gosh, do you  <br/>\nthink we could set up a mini-water park in our own yard? Have you guys  <br/>\never played on a slip-n-slide?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine that saying these kinds of things to them would create  <br/>\nan entirely different atmosphere and engender a lot more cooperation  <br/>\nwith you than you lecturing them about how rude it is to splash other  <br/>\npeople and how those people walking by didn&#39;t like it and blah blah  <br/>\nblah. If they expected cool ideas to come out of your mouth, they&#39;d  <br/>\ncome running when you called their name, not run the other way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am finding it very hard to justify to others (eg my mother) my move<br/>\n&gt; towards unschooling because it does not seem to be making my family<br/>\n&gt; any happier.

I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or<br/>\n&gt; good enough to offer our children this lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is good - you know what the problem is, deep in your heart you  <br/>\nknow you need to be more create and more pro-active. My experience is  <br/>\nthat those who worry about this are the ones who CAN do it!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can hear the negativity in my voice, and I am so churned up to have<br/>\n&gt; to admit this, but I feel far from living joyfully.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Where am I going wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It is all about how you think - work on changing the way you think  <br/>\nabout you and the boys. Work on thinking of yourself as their  <br/>\nsupporter. Maybe instead of thinking in terms of &quot;not saying no&quot; -  <br/>\nthink of more and more ways to say yes.

And the nice-mean-guilt cycle repeats.<br/>\nSome parents find relief by persuading their children to want less.

The resentment probably doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp, but you might look at it this way, you aren&#39;t here to satisfy  <br/>\nthem. I have unschooling friends in real life who KNOCK themselves  <br/>\nout trying to make their kids happy, and you really just cannot. Part  <br/>\nof the problem is that six and three and still so very young, and you  <br/>\naren&#39;t being sneered at, probably, they are probably just clueless as  <br/>\nto why what they are doing would upset you so. Can I offer what I  <br/>\nmight do in some of the situations you mentioned? It&#39;s easier for me  <br/>\nto say what I would have done, I know it&#39;s not easy to do it,  <br/>\nespecially when you are still making the transition, we&#39;ve only been  <br/>\nunschooling for three years. I guess when we started we had a  <br/>\nnewborn, 2yo, 4yo, 5yo, 6yo, 8yo, and 10yo. So I really do understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, forcing the door against the hinge: ask yourself why?  <br/>\nWhat are they trying to learn there? Experimenting to see what  <br/>\nhappens to the door, or what happens with YOU? If it&#39;s you, then it&#39;s  <br/>\neven more important to retain your cool. I&#39;m wondering how many of  <br/>\nthese things they persist on just because they are testing to see  <br/>\nyour reaction. They don&#39;t buy the whole unschooling thing because the  <br/>\nconsistency isn&#39;t there. For example, for the door, have dh nail a  <br/>\nstrip of wood in the jam to keep it from swinging the opposite way.  <br/>\nAll it took was breaking one cabinet door for our girls to realize  <br/>\nwhy they shouldn&#39;t bend it. I said a few times, giving them  <br/>\nknowledge, &quot;Bending that back will break it, and I&#39;d rather it didn&#39;t  <br/>\nget broken&quot; When it broke, I was upset, but I just took the door off  <br/>\nthe hinges and put it in the garage for dh to glue back together.  <br/>\nLesson learned. Now the boys have bent their hinges swinging on the  <br/>\ndoor. It doesn&#39;t quite fit into the jam anymore. Lesson learned. They  <br/>\ndon&#39;t really care. Dh and I figure when they get to be teens and care  <br/>\nmore about privacy, we&#39;ll replace the hinges anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, when I started going through your list, it just seemed  <br/>\noverwhelming. I think if you are thinking ALL these things aren&#39;t  <br/>\nworking, it&#39;s too much. Honestly, there&#39;s just one thing wrong here,  <br/>\nand it&#39;s the trust. But I&#39;d ask myself, why can&#39;t they open the oven  <br/>\ndoor? Because it&#39;s hot? Why not give them the knowledge and the  <br/>\nopportunity to do it safely? &quot;Hey, that&#39;s hot. If you want to open  <br/>\nit, we need hot pot holders. Talk about how the heat feels on their  <br/>\nbodies when they are close, and how far away they stand to not feel  <br/>\nit anymore. Get a cheap oven thermometer and look at it when the door  <br/>\nis first opened, and after it&#39;s been opened a while. Try to bake a  <br/>\ncake with the door open and time how long it takes. What&#39;s the cost  <br/>\nof a little electricity for them to SEE the difference? Same for the  <br/>\nfridge.

For some, like me, it&#39;s vital to keep<br/>\nour motivations to unschool our children ever before us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time for kids to believe parents.  You&#39;re changing parenting styles<br/>\nmidstream.  They haven&#39;t welcomed it because they don&#39;t see what your<br/>\nefforts can mean to them.  They&#39;re probably still hearing the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; more<br/>\nand finding the &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; perplexing, rather than part of a plan to become a<br/>\nmore peaceful loving parent/child.  After all, the majority of their lives<br/>\nhave been spent very differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time to learn an unconventional way to parent.  I think it&#39;s easy<br/>\nto think that if only parenting could operate more or less automatically,<br/>\nthings would be great.  Why isn&#39;t it like that?  Well, for instance, &quot;no&#39;s&quot;<br/>\ndepend on the adults in the family to gang up on the kids and be<br/>\n&quot;consistent&quot; in order to function.  Many adults could do authoritative<br/>\nstyles of parenting without ever doing any thinking.  It would be easy<br/>\nbecause they know it like the back of their hand and they wouldn&#39;t get any<br/>\nresistance from other adults around them about their parenting style.  In<br/>\nfact, I would get much better acceptance from others in my family if I were<br/>\nmore authoritarian.  My conscience would hurt until it I got it dampened<br/>\ndown enough to tolerate, but other than that I could do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGentle parenting and unschooling take many people quite a bit of effort.<br/>\nMore than others who were raised similarly to that style.  It can be tons<br/>\nmore than I want to do at times.  Many times I find that I flat out don&#39;t<br/>\nknow what I&#39;m doing.  Yet I&#39;m very motivated and I also want to keep myself<br/>\nmotivated.  So I keep reading on this list and others because I want to<br/>\nlearn differently than I grew up knowing about parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting is like a lot of things we might put effort into, like learning to<br/>\nfingerpick on the guitar or banjo or mandolin, and those skills can take<br/>\nyears and years to accomplish.  Unschooling doesn&#39;t necessarily take long<br/>\nbut since it isn&#39;t easy for me I want to keep after it.  It IS a lot for me<br/>\nAND after doing it for a while I have been able to see that it&#39;s worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes &quot;no&quot; is fine word but overused it can become a very difficult<br/>\nthing to deal with in unschooling because that word represents how attached<br/>\nwe are to controlling others instead of relating to them.  And so learning<br/>\nto relate to others more is a lot like this quote: * Do everything with a<br/>\nmind that lets go. If you let go a little you will have a little peace; if<br/>\nyou let go a lot you will have a lot of peace; if you let go completely you<br/>\nwill have complete peace. *<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can come to wholelife unschooling with the thought that it&#39;s just like<br/>\nauthoritarian parenting except that parents say &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;no.&quot;  As<br/>\nthough it were another 1-2-3 method.  It&#39;s not.  Authoritarian parents never<br/>\nneed a reason for saying no.  Parents who are unschooling are choosing to<br/>\nunderstand and talk about why they&#39;re saying &quot;yes&quot; and why they&#39;re saying<br/>\n&quot;no.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/29/08, almadoing &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:almadoing@...\">almadoing@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   We have been moving into unschooling for more than a year now but I<br/>\n&gt; am feeling very discouraged.
