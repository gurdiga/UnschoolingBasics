If you think this is the<br/>\ncase with your son, I wonder if talking to him about what he&#39;d do if the<br/>\nother kids were back at school would help.  Maybe you could work with him to<br/>\nfigure out ways to do some of those things now, although not as<br/>\nspontaneously?<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a difficult situation.

He went through it <br/>\na while ago.  It wasn&#39;t too long or too intense.  Currently he&#39;s kind <br/>\nof freaking me out.  He is SO bored.  He sometimes walks around in <br/>\ncircles in the back yard because he can&#39;t think of anything to do.  <br/>\nHe spends a lot of time walking around sighing, etc.  When I ask him <br/>\nwhat&#39;s up he says he&#39;s bored.  When I ask him what he wants to do he <br/>\nsays he doesn&#39;t know.  If I offer suggestions of things he might like <br/>\nto do he&#39;s not interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the appropriate response to this dilemma?  Have any of you <br/>\nbeen through this?  The poor kid just doesn&#39;t really seem too <br/>\ninterested in anything.  I&#39;m looking forward to the time when the <br/>\nother kids that are going back to school get there.  I know it may <br/>\nsound mean to some, but that&#39;s when we can truely be ourselves and <br/>\nspend our days the way we&#39;d like to without interference.  It really <br/>\nis difficult raising one unschooled child, with so many others in <br/>\npublic school.  Can anyone relate to this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny input on this subject would be greatly appreciated.  I&#39;ve really <br/>\nbeen enjoying reading the discussions that have been going on <br/>\nlately...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2796,"nextTopicId":2804}}
