Our country was named, he was elected.<br/>\nThat makes him the first leader in my book.<br/>\nThe position did not have the same power or significance at that<br/>\ntime...our current constitution was not drafted yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The failure of the Articles of Confederation led to calls for<br/>\nestablishment of a centralized federal government with much broader<br/>\npowers than the Congress of the Confederacy, a task accomplished<br/>\nthrough the drafting and ratification of a new Constitution in<br/>\n1787-88. It was this Constitution, not the Articles of Confederation,<br/>\nthat created the office of a chief executive as part of a truly<br/>\nfederal government for the United States Â— an office bearing the title<br/>\n&quot;President of the United States of America&quot; and first filled by George<br/>\nWashington, unanimously selected as the first President in February 1789.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I just find it interesting that our country was founded, 8 leaders<br/>\nelected to govern the main branch of government at the time and yet<br/>\nwere never mentioned in my U.S. History classes in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a very in-depth look at our history in my opinion.  George<br/>\nWashington was the first president under our current<br/>\nconstitution...but he was the 9th elected leader of our country.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10686,"nextTopicId":10713}}
