He hasn&#39;t had any antibiotics in as long as I can remember, so I&#39;m not concerned about that, but I will do some research and see if yeast might be connected to his cravings. I had a friend years ago who suffered with candida albicans, unknowingly. He had a lot of topical skin rashes, especially in the crook of his elbows and knees, and an allergist recommended a lot of dietary changes (no mushrooms, no fermented foods, no yeast products, etc) and gave him tube after tube of cortisone, to no avail. I was a &quot;health food nut&quot; back then and had read about candidiasis. I diagnosed him correctly after looking just once at his arms and legs and asking some questions about his &quot;allergies&quot;. A few months and several bottles of lactobacillus acidophilus pills later, his rashes were fading, and within a year he was a different person entirely. No more mood swings, fatigue, or rashes at all. <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is the problem, but it is good for people to be aware of this condition. In my friend&#39;s case, it was truly debilitating at times, and his lack of a proper diagnosis resulted in years of pain and suffering.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also have what my mom called a sweet tooth, so I can sympathize with my son. I love candy, but i don&#39;t feel great when I eat it, and neither does he. I just want him to feel good, and he hasn&#39;t seemed to lately, so I figured I&#39;d ask for some advice.<br/>\n <br/>\nToday he chose a small plate of grapes over a cup of pudding. I just walked into the room where he was playing and put both nearby. We had been swimming and I figured he was hungry. I wanted to just give him something quick and easy, and those we the two quickest available things. He didn&#39;t even touch the pudding and even exclaimed, &quot;Yum! Grapes!&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was pretty awesome.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 8/6/08, Julie WH &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie.wh68@...\">julie.wh68@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Julie WH &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:julie.wh68@...\">julie.wh68@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] re: food restriction<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wednesday, August 6, 2008, 12:37 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Angela,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mention of sugar cravings made me wonder if maybe your son has an underlying health concern that could be driving it. All my life I&#39;ve dealt with yeast infections (and not just &quot;down there&quot; :). Yeast thrive on sugar, and the more yeast (candida) you have in your body (basically any mucus membrane, like your guts) the more sugar you crave. The yeast feast on it and multiply -- it&#39;s a nasty cycle. A severe yeast infection also has symptoms like fatigue and irritability. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son struggles with yeast at times. He&#39;s still transitioning out of diapers (he just turned 3) and occasionally gets yeast infections around his bum. He clearly craves sugar when he&#39;s got yeast down there. I help him deal with it, not by restricting any foods, but by offering LOTS more low/no carb foods as well as fruit (which still has sugar, but less so than say a cookie) and also by temporarily buying artificially sweetened products of his sweet favorites like ice cream. (I put aloe and tea tree on his bum to kill the yeast topically, and encourage more naked time without a diaper. I also take lots of garlic so he&#39;ll get it in my milk when he nurses. And I put liquid acidophilus in his drinks to help the healthy bacteria grow so the yeast doesn&#39;t have &quot;room&quot; to thrive.) <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also talk a bit about how his bum hurts from the yeast, that the yeast need sugar to grow, and that cookies, etc., have lots of sugar. I try to make sure I say it in a way that&#39;s simply informational and not at a moment when he&#39;s having a strong craving and not particularly &quot;rational&quot;. :) I don&#39;t want him to feel bad about eating sugar, only to understand how it can affect his body. Even at his young age, he often decides to eat non-sugary things because he knows it&#39;ll help his bum feel better. (Once while changing a poopy diaper I casually mentioned his bum looked red, uncomfortable and yeasty, and he replied, &quot;Oh, I ate lots of cookies this morning.&quot; I had to catch myself not to LEAP on that &quot;learning moment&quot; and replied as laid-back as possible, &quot;Hmm, yep, looks like the yeast ate that sugar right up,&quot; and left it at that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you might google &quot;candida yeast infection&quot; and see if the symptoms fit for your son. (Especially suspect yeast if your son has been on antibiotics recently or often in the last couple years.) I would imagine there might be other physical conditions that could cause sugar craving, so you could research that as well. Or better yet, consult your favorite alternative- minded doctor/naturopath/ homeopath/ herbalist.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have mentioned, it could very well just be a phase, such as preparing for a growth spurt.

And that is simply because the food I offer is usually slightly more complicated than the food that Simon and Linnaea get on their own. It&#39;s carrots and celery and bell peppers and tortilla chips with dips or it&#39;s a chocolate fondue with apples and pears and bananas and strawberries to dip, or it&#39;s pbj&#39;s cut up and apples with cinammon and sugar and cheese puffs. Often if I see Linnaea grabbing her third bag of chips (single portion is about the only way that chips are packaged in the UK) I will offer to, or will just make a plate of food for her to have. Sometimes you want a bunch of chips, sometimes you want food and you aren&#39;t being specific, just going for ease of access. It isn&#39;t about what you are buying it is more about what you are making easily accesible.

I am <br/>\ntroubled because I see that he has gained a lot of weight over the <br/>\npast seven months. I have never restricted food, and I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nbegin, but I really see my son&#39;s body changing, and he does not seem <br/>\nas healthy and energetic as he was before he gained the weight. He no <br/>\nlonger seems to want to ride his bike, he gets tired easily when we <br/>\nrun and play tag, and I don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening. I want him to <br/>\nfeel good and strong and healthy. <br/>\nBecause I want to help him, I have started shopping a little <br/>\ndifferently. I don&#39;t buy all the things I used to buy, because I want <br/>\nto offer him healthy foods, and not so many treats. I have trusted <br/>\nhim in the past to choose a little of both, but he has always chosen <br/>\ncookies, ice cream, and sweets over everything else. He also had a <br/>\nvery painful cavity in one of his back teeth very recently and had to <br/>\nhave the truth extracted. The dentist asked about his diet and I told <br/>\nhim my son eats a lot of sweets. He suggested we try to cut down and <br/>\neat more vegetables and fresh, raw foods. <br/>\nI need help with this. I am fairly new to this lifestyle and feel <br/>\nlike I am sitting on the fence on some issues, and is one is by far <br/>\nthe toughest I have dealt with so far. I don&#39;t restrict bedtime, and <br/>\nthat has never been a problem, nor have I had any trouble with my <br/>\nchildren being home, aside from the occasional sibling argument and <br/>\nsome minor violence from my son. I&#39;ve been able to feel confident in <br/>\nmy choices and my children&#39;s choices on all other issues, so this is <br/>\nvery frustrating to me. Do I continue to shop alone, slowly <br/>\neliminating as many sweets as possible? Do I just let him deal with <br/>\nthe consequences of eating too much sugar and fat? I want to help him <br/>\nbe a healthy boy, but I don&#39;t want to shame him in any way because he <br/>\nis getting...what do I say here without sounding judgmental.. .heavy.<br/>\nThis may sound like a silly problem, but it&#39;s really begun to bother <br/>\nme, and I truly need some help.<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n_    <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food restriction","postDate":"1217931885","msgId":35131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFMUY5RDM4LTRBRDAtNERBQy1CRDlFLTRGODJCNTNBRjRBNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3OTQxNC44MDgxNi5xbUB3ZWIzMzIwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQ3OTQxNC44MDgxNi5xbUB3ZWIzMzIwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35129,"nextInTopic":35132,"prevInTime":35130,"nextInTime":35132,"topicId":35124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If he asks for ice cream for breakfast, I give him ice cream for breakfast. Or anything else. He chooses to have cereal often, and I keep his favorite here. We use organic dairy products and meats. My husband is often baffled because I bring home organic cheese and eggs but also Reese&#39;s peanut butter cups. To his mind I am &quot;inconsistent&quot;, but the way I see it is, we like candy, and I like to buy foods that I know are healthful, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have never, and will never, shame my son or make him feel fat. My son is a beautiful boy, with a heart of gold. I am just concerned about his health because of the obvious weight gain and apparent lack of motivation that I have observed since he started to eat so much sugar and fattening food. I want him to feel good, emotionally and physically. And it seems to me that he is not feeling very good physically. He is choosing sugar over everything, every time, even with little buffet style meals that include healthier selections. He seems to have lost all interest and/or desire for wholesome food, and it is taking a toll. When I offer things, he chooses the sweet, every time.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for cavities, I have started looking into xylitol. This is a new thing for me. I am trying to find out what we can do about his teeth so he doesn&#39;t have to go throught that terrible experience again (toothache and extraction).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 8/4/08, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom:IAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food restriction<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nDate: Monday, August 4, 2008, 5:54 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh My !

My sister says she does not restrict foods too but I see her tell the kids:<br/>\n&quot;Just one candy now&quot;<br/>\n&quot; You got to eat your food before the ice-dream&quot;<br/>\n&quot; I am not going to by candy this time&quot;<br/>\n&quot; I will not give you cake if you don&#39;t behave&quot;<br/>\nAnd she hides the candy so they don;t eat all at once.<br/>\nSo that makes candy scarse and kids feel that and if they have the chance they will eat as much as they can becasue they don&#39;;t have all they want at any time.<br/>\nIn my house my kids go thru fases. A while ago my son wanted Laffy-Taffy. I just bought him 3 huge bags of it.<br/>\nThat was like a month ago.<br/>\nThe first bag went fast. The second they ate slowly all but left the banana flavor and the last still here. I alwasy have at leat one bag of peanut butter cups and my dd just likes to open them and sometimes take one tiny little bite. She never eats them. They are in the cabinet if they want whenever they want.<br/>\nSecond;<br/>\nHow old is your son. Pre-adolescence( pre-teens) tend to put on weight to get ready for a growth spur. I had so many chunky friends until they where 13-15 that shot up and became skinny all by themnselves including my step-son who lost all his weight and was never bothered by his mon or my ex. <br/>\nThird;<br/>\nUnschooling is not just letting them eat  without guidance. Guidance does not mean any type of control<br/>\nThere has been a lot written about food in this board.This is what I wrote a while ago:<br/>\nI think what a lot of new to unschooling parents don&#39;t get about letting kids<br/>\nchoose what they eat is that you just don&#39;t just leave those kids alone to<br/>\nfigure things out.<br/>\nEspecially little ones need to have parents that are present and attuned to<br/>\nthem.<br/>\nYou, the parent, is still responsible to having AND OFFERING a variety of<br/>\nhealthy choices to your child every so often.<br/>\nThings that a parent can do is:<br/>\n* Have the Monkey Platter available ( we call it &quot;Goodies Plate)What I do is I<br/>\nprepare a big plate with little portions of snacks and foods that can be eaten<br/>\nby hand like raisins, carrots, celery, chocolate chips, deli meat or other,<br/>\ntofu, cheeses, breads( cut up cute and small), baby spinach, potato chips,<br/>\nbroccoli, you get the point... ( all those are examples of what my son likes and<br/>\nI buy them all organic and whole grains etc) I will also ad whatever else they<br/>\nwant maybe M& Ms, chocolate chip cookies or Gummy Bears, etc<br/>\n* I bring then something every 2 hours the most ( my kids are 4 and a half and<br/>\nalmost one- the baby nurses a lot still). I found out that if they go longer<br/>\nwithout eating they get real hungry and head for the less healthy , more sugary<br/>\nand handy stuff. If I anticipate the hunger they prefer to eat the cut up pear,<br/>\nthe organic yogurt ect.<br/>\n*&#39;If my son is playing games and does not want to stop but I know he is hungry (<br/>\ngetting moody and frustrated at the game) I will hand feed him. No problem and<br/>\nhe really appreciates plus it is a moment that he feels special since I spend so<br/>\nmany times taking care of the baby.<br/>\n*If we are shopping and he wants something I just buy it for him. Whatever it<br/>\nis. &quot;Junk&quot; or not. He can have it. Most times he will try it and not like it. If<br/>\nhe does we just always buy for him or ask if he wants it when we are shopping. I<br/>\nlike to buy what he likes to have at home at all times if possible.<br/>\nWe talk about healthy foods and I read labels and try to simply explain why some<br/>\nthings are good and some are not.<br/>\nLately he heard about trans fats and found out that the cookies Daddy likes have<br/>\nlots of it. So he now asks me to make some healthy cookies for him. Of course if<br/>\nhe still wants those because we don&#39;t have ready healthy cookies he will just<br/>\ngrab the other so it is up to me to make sure he has healthy ones.<br/>\nHe has eaten maybe one or two of the &quot;trans fat&quot; cookies...since that discovery.<br/>\nI need to make more healthy one ASAP<br/>\nHe also asked for orange juice about a month ago when he had a little head cold<br/>\nand needed his vitamin C.<br/>\nIf he is eating a little too much sugar I offer some protein to help his body<br/>\nnot have a sugar crash. He does take my advice because I have pointed out when<br/>\nhe was having a sugar crash and he does not like to feel that way.<br/>\nKids want to feel good. Give them a chance, Respect their choices, be proactive,<br/>\nbe there, do not be judgmental of their choices.<br/>\nIf my ds asks for ice cream for breakfast he gets ice cream. I don&#39;t tell him<br/>\nice cream is bad and he should choose something else. I have a healthier ice<br/>\ncream that I buy and he loves. I just give to him.<br/>\nA little later I offer him other things to eat.<br/>\nSo what I am trying to say is that when you unschool food you don&#39;t just start<br/>\noffering candy and pop and let your kids figure it out by themselves when they<br/>\nare hungry when they are only 3.<br/>\nOffer them choices, let them eat what they want or not. let them ask for<br/>\nsomething else. Let them have the cake once, three times, ten times, but offer<br/>\nin a plate other choices. More likely than not they will also eat other things<br/>\nand not only the cake.<br/>\nSometimes I ask my ds if he wants like say pasta and chicken for lunch and he<br/>\nwill tell me he wants ice cream first. He will eat his ice cream and his other<br/>\nfood.<br/>\nHope it helps<br/>\nAlex<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nFourth:<br/>\nHere about cavities ans xylitol ( to help prevent)<br/>\nI have done  a lot of research on cavities and sugar alone will not cause it.<br/>\nThere are many factors involved.

I am <br/>\ntroubled because I see that he has gained a lot of weight over the <br/>\npast seven months. I have never restricted food, and I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nbegin, but I really see my son&#39;s body changing, and he does not seem <br/>\nas healthy and energetic as he was before he gained the weight. He no <br/>\nlonger seems to want to ride his bike, he gets tired easily when we <br/>\nrun and play tag, and I don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening. I want him to <br/>\nfeel good and strong and healthy. <br/>\nBecause I want to help him, I have started shopping a little <br/>\ndifferently. I don&#39;t buy all the things I used to buy, because I want <br/>\nto offer him healthy foods, and not so many treats. I have trusted <br/>\nhim in the past to choose a little of both, but he has always chosen <br/>\ncookies, ice cream, and sweets over everything else. He also had a <br/>\nvery painful cavity in one of his back teeth very recently and had to <br/>\nhave the truth extracted. The dentist asked about his diet and I told <br/>\nhim my son eats a lot of sweets. He suggested we try to cut down and <br/>\neat more vegetables and fresh, raw foods. <br/>\nI need help with this. I am fairly new to this lifestyle and feel <br/>\nlike I am sitting on the fence on some issues, and is one is by far <br/>\nthe toughest I have dealt with so far. I don&#39;t restrict bedtime, and <br/>\nthat has never been a problem, nor have I had any trouble with my <br/>\nchildren being home, aside from the occasional sibling argument and <br/>\nsome minor violence from my son. I&#39;ve been able to feel confident in <br/>\nmy choices and my children&#39;s choices on all other issues, so this is <br/>\nvery frustrating to me. Do I continue to shop alone, slowly <br/>\neliminating as many sweets as possible? Do I just let him deal with <br/>\nthe consequences of eating too much sugar and fat? I want to help him <br/>\nbe a healthy boy, but I don&#39;t want to shame him in any way because he <br/>\nis getting...what do I say here without sounding judgmental...heavy.<br/>\nThis may sound like a silly problem, but it&#39;s really begun to bother <br/>\nme, and I truly need some help.<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nAngela</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22463,"nextTopicId":35173}}
