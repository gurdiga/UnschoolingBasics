I have hoped this is normal, and have chosen to say little <br/>\nabout it.  It makes dh very uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rented an Arthur video with an episode about baseball, since <br/>\nOrion <br/>\njust started t-ball.  She must have watched (studied) that movie 20 <br/>\ntimes.  I did not sit and watch the entire thing with her, but heard <br/>\nenough to recognize some of DW&#39;s negative phrases coming out of <br/>\nOrion&#39;s mouth the following week.  &quot;No one likes me,&quot;  &quot;No one <br/>\nloves <br/>\nme anymore,&quot; and &quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot;  She was repeating so often <br/>\nwe <br/>\nhave had to address it, almost to no avail.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m reading this wondering where the problem is???:)<br/>\nIt all sounds so normal to me, really. I don&#39;t see why that would <br/>\nmake anyone <br/>\nuncomfortable. I remember playing with barbie&#39;s just like that, only <br/>\nmuch more <br/>\nintimate. This is very normal for children.<br/>\nThey act out things they don&#39;t understand, try on behaviors just <br/>\nlike clothing. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all part of learning. It&#39;s HEALTHY....sounds like she&#39;s a <br/>\nreally bright <br/>\nchild that is absorbing and trying to make sense of the world around <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":721,"nextTopicId":755}}
