They are there for <br/>\ninformation.  And yes your ways will be  questioned and asked to be explained.  <br/>\nIf you are a sensitive person these  lists are not for you.  They are not <br/>\nmeant as a personal attack on you or  your parenting styles it is merly a way to <br/>\nget to you to maybe look at it from a  different way.  To get you to see there <br/>\nare other options maybe better  options then the ones you presented.  Most <br/>\npeople who are on these lists  that you think are rude are there for that <br/>\ninteraction.  They want to  be questioned and asked why and how and what it will <br/>\naccomplish.  It  is how we grow as parents and partners to our kids.   Once again  <br/>\nif you go and read the mission statement for most of the groups it clearly <br/>\nsays  these are NOT support groups. And that if you get easily offended then <br/>\nthese  lists are probably not for you.  But there are a lot of great groups that  <br/>\nARE support groups if that is what you are looking for.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Alyssa <br/>\nSlightly crunchy, unschooling Mom to Landen(2 1/2)  and Gage(7 months)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Work like you don&#39;t need the money, love like you&#39;ve  never been hurt, and <br/>\ndance like you do when nobody&#39;s  watching.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Wondering","postDate":"1147635110","msgId":13108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUzMEUxNkM2LUNDQjUtNEM1Qi05MTQyLTYyQzVFREJDMjMwQUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0N212bSszZWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU0N212bSszZWZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13099,"nextInTopic":13116,"prevInTime":13107,"nextInTime":13109,"topicId":13098,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
