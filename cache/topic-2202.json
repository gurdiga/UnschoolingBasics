We live in<br/>\nPerth, Western Australia.<br/>\nI have been having a great time for the last couple of weeks reading<br/>\nall the great posts and checking out the sites recommended by you <br/>\nguys.  Unschooling both in lifestyle and schooling is the way I want<br/>\nmy life to go,especially after all that I have seen.  In a lot of <br/>\nthings I have a long way to go I know coz I still find my self saying <br/>\nand doing things I could kick myself for afterwards, but I guess we <br/>\nall have to start somewhere.<br/>\n  The advice I need help with is how do I explain that my son is <br/>\nprogressing in recquired(by the education department not me) fields.<br/>\n  I got a letter from them to say they need to make another <br/>\nevaluation as they are not satisfied with his literacy,numeracy and <br/>\nbehaviour.  I have only had him out of school since September last <br/>\nyear btw.<br/>\n  He reads what he needs to and asks for help with things if he wants <br/>\nto know and personally I am fine with that, for example he got given <br/>\nan old typewriter and tonite has been typing peoples names and typed <br/>\nme a little letter.<br/>\n  Behaviour wise he will improve eventually but it will take time is <br/>\nmy thought and gut feeling and maths I am sure he is doing somewhere <br/>\nin there but I am not sure how to show those two things.<br/>\n  So after all that rambling on I guess my question is to those of <br/>\nyou who are more experienced in all this than me if you have any <br/>\nsuggestions to help me I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n  Oh btw we did try the school at home method to start with and it <br/>\ndefinitly doesn&quot;t work well with my son unless people love listening <br/>\nto a mother and son yell at each other.....no fun for him or me lol.<br/>\n  Anyway thanks for reading my long intro and hope to talk with you <br/>\nall soon,<br/>\n<br/>\nSue</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2151,"nextTopicId":2204}}
