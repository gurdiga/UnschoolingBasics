She&#39;s getting to that age where<br/>\nshe wants &quot;cool stuff&quot; and if she had the freedom to do that for<br/>\nherself she might see things differently.  I think that my oldest<br/>\nchild was about the same age as your daughter when she told me once<br/>\nthat she hated her siblings&#39; birthdays because they got something and<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t fair that she had to wait until November every<br/>\nyear for her birthday when their birthdays were earlier in the year<br/>\nand Daddy doesn&#39;t heve have to wait but 23 days each year for his<br/>\nbirthday.  She couldn&#39;t see that everyone has to wait 365 days from<br/>\nbirthday to birthday.  Now she delights in her siblings&#39; birthdays and<br/>\nenjoys planning their presents and surprises.  She talks says things<br/>\nlike, &quot;Oh Keon would LOVE this for his birthday&quot; or &quot;This would be so<br/>\ncool to give Mary Elayne for Yule!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I have to do with my son when we go out shopping is to<br/>\nstate what it is we are shopping for.  That this is all we can get<br/>\ntoday.  It really lessens the &quot;I wants&quot; plus he has his own money and<br/>\nif he truly wants something he knows he can buy it.  He has the<br/>\ncontrol to get it if he really wants.  I think it helps him with<br/>\ndecision making on spending.  &quot;Is this something that I would be<br/>\nwilling to spend my money on?  If not then perhaps it isn&#39;t something<br/>\nthat mom would spend her money on either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the more freedoms your daughter has the easier things will be<br/>\nfor her.  BTW, I have a child who also has anxieties that are<br/>\nportrayed by selective muteness.  She&#39;s been known not to talk for<br/>\ndays.  She&#39;s 11 now we have fewer and fewer days where this is an<br/>\nissue.  Sometimes she just can&#39;t express what is causing her<br/>\nanxieities.  Although knowing that mom can try to fix something if she<br/>\nunderstands it has really helped.  Building that trust took several<br/>\nyears.  She feels her emotions physically.  She had an incident a<br/>\nwhile back and two days afterwards she told me, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nexplain how I feel.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m being pushed in from two different<br/>\nsides and being squished.&quot;  I&#39;ve learned to ask her how she feels<br/>\nphysically, not emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace!<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":108258695,"authorName":"hanjkyla","from":"&quot;hanjkyla&quot; &lt;kyleac@...&gt;","profile":"hanjkyla","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Introduction & allowance","postDate":"1162042705","msgId":18644,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVodm1naCtrdTQxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18645,"prevInTime":18643,"nextInTime":18645,"topicId":18644,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi.

We also have an 11yr old DS who wants to <br/>\nstay in PS.  I didn&#39;t choose unschooling because it is what I wanted <br/>\nto do.  Our dd has Selective Mutism, an anxiety disorder.  She was <br/>\nhaving a really bad year and being mis-treated at school.  She came <br/>\nhome with bruises.  So we decided to homeschool to protect her. She <br/>\nchose unschooling because PS was such a horrible experience for her <br/>\nthat if you put anything in front of her that even slightly <br/>\nresembles PS work she just shuts down.  I know this is what she <br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been home two weeks now and mostly its been good.  Yesterday <br/>\nthough was a bad day.  My dh runs his own business and needed some <br/>\nsupplys. I wanted to start Christmas shopping.  I was bored.  My <br/>\nsister invited us to go shopping with her.  I asked dd if she wanted <br/>\nto do that, saying we could look for some supplys for a project we <br/>\nwere planning togeather. She said yes.  We get to the store to get <br/>\ndh&#39;s supplies and dd asked for a new halloween costume.  I said no <br/>\nbecause I&#39;d already bought her a new costume this yr that she picked <br/>\nout and wore at the &quot;halloween camping weekend&quot; we went to in Sept.  <br/>\nIn Sept I told her I didn&#39;t want to spend $ on a pre-made costume <br/>\nbecause they are expensive but so cheaply made.  She came up with a <br/>\ncostume idea to make but when we got to the store she changed her <br/>\nmind about it and asked for a pre-made costume.  I said ok.  She <br/>\ntook forever to decide on one because she kept changing her mind <br/>\n(decisions are hard for her because of her anxiety disorder).  She <br/>\nended up loving what she got and wore it a lot.  So back to <br/>\nyesterday....I said no I wasn&#39;t buying her a second one. I told her <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t have money for that because we needed to get gloves, <br/>\nboots, & hats, our project & Christmas presents. She was angry with <br/>\nme and then refuse to walk with us through the store.  I tried <br/>\ncheering her up and my sister did too.  I tried explaining to her <br/>\nand telling her lets just get his boring stuff done & then we&#39;ll get <br/>\nlunch, you can pick where, and we&#39;ll look for our fun stuff for the <br/>\nproject, ect, ect.  She wouldn&#39;t budge or talk.  So I left our cart <br/>\nand took her to the car.  She wrote I hate you on her pants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like she thinks things will make her happy but they don&#39;t.  <br/>\nShe asks me to buy her something every time we go to the store but <br/>\nthe majority of the time she doesn&#39;t touch it again when we get <br/>\nhome.
