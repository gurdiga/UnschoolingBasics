I seek to go with the flow of living and learning and that includes my children having the same freedom.  I am finding on my personal spiritual journey that it is not going with the flow that causes us to have the bumps and falls that we experience.  I hope that my children have less backtracking to do than I have and I feel that unschooling is the way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nTyra<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: 2006/08/19 Sat AM 09:20:40 CDT<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Late readers; was support<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no &quot;moving on&quot; in unschooling...just the flow of living and<br/>\nlearning.
