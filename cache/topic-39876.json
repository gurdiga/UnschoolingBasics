Linnaea has had periods of time that were<br/>\nmarked by huge mood swings and volatile emotions. The last one was when<br/>\nshe was 7 almost 8 and it lasted for a few months. It was hard and<br/>\ndepressing and exhausting. I kept looking for ways to fix her. To make<br/>\nher better. I wanted her to see that she wasn&#39;t happy and to make the<br/>\neffort to be happier. It didn&#39;t work. It just made her feel bad. After<br/>\nshe blew up she felt so awful for the blow up that she&#39;d stay upset and<br/>\nthe upset would become self-loathing. I stopped trying to fix it. I<br/>\nstopped seeing it as something I could solve if I could just get the<br/>\nwords right so that she would understand. I started to just sit with<br/>\nher when she was upset and to be with her much more when she wasn&#39;t. I<br/>\nplayed with her more, I got us all out more for sword and light sabre<br/>\nbattles at castle ruins and days in town. I made sure that hungry<br/>\nwasn&#39;t coming into play. I upped all of my care and attention, both for<br/>\nher and for Simon. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I don&#39;t know what stopped the cycle. I don&#39;t know if it was<br/>\na phase, a developmental period of incredible discomfort that she moved<br/>\nthrough. I do know that the attention made a difference. I do know that<br/>\nme being more present really helped enormously in lengthening the time<br/>\nbetween her meltdowns and the duration of each one. I also know that trying to talk to her about what was going on seemed to make it worse. But listening and sitting with her and holding her when she was ready to be held made it better. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote that there weren&#39;t specific triggers, but you also said that<br/>\nhe is demanding recompense when things aren&#39;t going his way. Can you<br/>\nwork to meet his demands? Can you do what you can to get things to go<br/>\nhis way? You said you are open to your children coming up with<br/>\nalternate solutions, I liked his solution of going to the library to<br/>\nrent the dvd of the television show he was missing. Could you have also<br/>\nlooked on-line and seen if you could have rented it from netflix or<br/>\nwatched it on the channel&#39;s webpage? It will help him to feel more<br/>\nvalued if you do make the effort to meet his needs when he is being<br/>\nasked to submit to someone else&#39;s needs, like going to pick up his<br/>\nsister from school. I do it a lot with Simon and Linnaea. If I need to<br/>\ngo do something, and there isn&#39;t any way that I can let them stay at<br/>\nhome or accomodate their preference, I will offer incentives, payments, for them coming along. A stop at a gaming store, a trip to<br/>\nBurger King or whatever else they might like, those things make the<br/>\ntrip not just about what I need to get done, but also about giving them<br/>\npleasure. Giving him what he asks for, no matter how he asked, isn&#39;t spoiling him or rewarding him for bad behaviour, it&#39;s helping him to get what he needs. The more you do that, the better he&#39;ll feel about himself and about you and the less likely he is to feel a need to call you stupid or stick his tongue out at you. Those are the actions of someone who feels powerless, help him to feel powerful. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s been leveling ultimatums about the conditions under which he will or won&#39;t do something, as well as telling us what we have to do to make things up to him if things aren&#39;t going 100 percent his way.
