There&#39;s a lot more to do constantly. It&#39;s never done.

Then, another 5 minutes to toss it<br/>\ninto the dryer and again 30-45 minutes or so for it to dry. Save the<br/>\nfolding for when everyone&#39;s content to watch a video or something. My DH<br/>\nis the at home parent (and DS, turned 10 TODAY) is an only child so<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t siblings handy to &quot;play with&quot; if DH is not available.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve decided that it works best (given there&#39;s only 3 of us) to spend<br/>\none day per week doing laundry. DH will get it sorted early in the<br/>\nmorning (he&#39;s up around 6, DS gets up anywhere from 7 to 11 depending on<br/>\nwhen he went to sleep) and down to the basement laundry room. They&#39;ll<br/>\nplay videogames or whatever usual stuff they want to do with short<br/>\npauses for DH to switch laundry loads. Around 9 pm it all gets carried<br/>\nback upstairs to the bedroom when DH and I head up. We&#39;ll pop in a DVD<br/>\nor pick a TV program and have a folding party - DS often pops in if he&#39;s<br/>\nnot doing anything else and handles the washcloths, towels, and his<br/>\nclothing (easier to manage because it&#39;s smaller than DH&#39;s 3X t-shirts).<br/>\nSometimes, if DS is occupied and DH wants to, he&#39;ll fold it as it gets<br/>\nfinished but that&#39;s not &quot;required&quot; - there are busy weeks when we live<br/>\nout of the clean laundry baskets (we have separate baskets for clean and<br/>\ndirty laundry).<br/>\n<br/>\nDishes sometimes get done immediately after the meal - since that&#39;s a<br/>\n&#39;break in the action&#39; anyhow - but more often than not, the day&#39;s dishes<br/>\nget done after dinner. Sometimes, DH will get the previous day&#39;s stuff<br/>\ndone in the early morning while DS is still asleep. And sometimes he&#39;ll<br/>\ndo it while DS is otherwise occupied in something (He&#39;s heavily into<br/>\ndesigning new maps/scenarios in Warcraft, not WoW, related but not the<br/>\nsame thing). <br/>\n<br/>\nStuff like bathroom cleaning and sweeping floors and all (wood floors in<br/>\nall but one room) gets done in one swoop usually on Saturday mornings.<br/>\nThat way, DH and I are both there and can kind of &#39;tag team&#39; so that one<br/>\nof us can be available when DS needs. For that matter, sometimes DS<br/>\nchooses to come grocery shopping with me of a Saturday and DH will do a<br/>\nonce over on the house while we&#39;re gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, sort out the &quot;really need to get to&quot; stuff from the &quot;voices<br/>\nin my head say I have to&quot; stuff. Note there&#39;s no &quot;have to&quot; category<br/>\nbecause there are really very few &quot;have to&quot;s in life - aside from death,<br/>\nmost other stuff is &#39;optional&#39; we&#39;re just trained to think it&#39;s<br/>\nrequired. Don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; eat or breath or sleep even - of course, the<br/>\nconsequences of those are pretty dire past a certain point. This<br/>\nmorning, the dishes at our house &#39;really need to&#39; get done - busy<br/>\nweekend left more dishes than usual in the sink. Plus, with warmer<br/>\nweather, the odds of flies and other critters increases so doing dishes<br/>\nrises in the priority level. So, that&#39;s high on DH&#39;s list for today<br/>\n(it&#39;s not a physical list, more of a general mental idea of what he<br/>\nwants to do for the day) - dishes, duct tape, and DS&#39; birthday dinner<br/>\ntonight at our favorite sushi place. Everything else is negotiable. Last<br/>\nnight, DS asked if we could play MegaMonopoly after dinner - no problem,<br/>\njust let me clear the table of the dinner stuff first, then I need to do<br/>\nmy 30 minutes on the treadmill (as a type 2 diabetic, daily exercise is<br/>\ncritical for my health so that&#39;s a priority item), so I should be ready<br/>\naround &lt;time&gt; to play. I *could* have said &quot;No I can&#39;t play, I have to<br/>\ndo the dishes&quot; but really, there&#39;s no &quot;have to&quot; re: dishes - they&#39;ll<br/>\nstill be there in an hour or a day. The one thing that does get priority<br/>\nis our individual mugs that we use for our evening tea time (somewhere<br/>\nbetween 8 and 9 pm most evenings) - those get washed out even if there&#39;s<br/>\nstill a stack left, tea time is a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know if this will help much or if it&#39;s pretty much just an early<br/>\nMonday morning ramble...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

My 17 yo cleared up the bathroom yesterday, but didn&#39;t  <br/>\nsweep the floor and I have that on my mental list to do, because I  <br/>\nnotice every time I visit the bathroom (now that the room is clean,  <br/>\nthe unswept floor is calling to me &lt;G&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe house is cluttered. The kids do their own laundry - but mine is  <br/>\npiled up in the laundry room waiting to be folded and put away. In the  <br/>\nmeantime, I&#39;m running out the door to go to my 23 year old&#39;s house -  <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to cook some stuff from a new cookbook we both just got  <br/>\n(Hungry Girl) and we&#39;re going to make artist trading cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - just get used to doing what you can, ignoring the rest. And  <br/>\npractice fitting it in in little bits during the whole day&#39;s flow. It  <br/>\nis STILL like that for us. The BIG secret for me, about housework, was  <br/>\nnot to think of it as big lumpy jobs, but as constant little bits of  <br/>\n&quot;not-much.&quot; Fold a few things here, put a few things away there. Wipe  <br/>\noff a counter, clean a sink. I don&#39;t often &quot;clean the kitchen&quot; - but I  <br/>\nclean up bits of it almost every time I&#39;m in there. I don&#39;t &quot;clean out  <br/>\nthe refrigerator&quot; but I clean out the inside of one door or just the  <br/>\nfruit drawer - or I sort of browse through the fridge when I&#39;m getting  <br/>\nsomething and I toss some old leftovers right then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo lots of housework gets done sort of without fanfare or much notice.  <br/>\nWhen I decide to tackle something bigger - clean out a closet or  <br/>\nreorganize shelves or something - kids will soemtimes get involved if  <br/>\nI say, &quot;Hey, want to help?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-Pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95478866,"authorName":"Kelly & Rachel","from":"&quot;Kelly & Rachel&quot; &lt;kelly-rachel@...&gt;","profile":"kellynrachel","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Need help finding my way","postDate":"1212249144","msgId":33292,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM4YzMzNiQ1MWYzNzg2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBrcnBjPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33300,"prevInTime":33291,"nextInTime":33293,"topicId":33292,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am relatively new to the concept Radical Unschooling.
