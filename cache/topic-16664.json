The idea is not to startle a kid out of  <br/>\nthis gentle, fantasy world, so the whole thing has a rhythm to it, with the  <br/>\nadults being directive, although not usually too intrusive. (The adults are even <br/>\n supposed to dress in these flowy outfits.)  And they play this game called  <br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s pretend things like tv, computers, video games, and plastic toys don&#39;t  <br/>\nexist.&quot; While it&#39;s a somewhat interesting game occasionally, it&#39;s hard to buy <br/>\n into.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16658,"nextTopicId":16669}}
