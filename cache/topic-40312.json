We lived on a very minimal budget, and I found work where I could. I worked with a temp. bartending service on the weekends the boys were with their dads, trying to get as many hours in as I could when they were not home. I did odd jobs here and there, babysat, helped a friend paint her house... <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the while, learning more about radical unschooling, getting more and more in tune with my boys. I lucked into a job a few years ago... a friend needed someone to work in his office 10 - 15 hours a week. I talked it over with the boys, and they were OK with me going in. On the second day there, I realized it was a job I could do from home, and I went into my boss&#39;s office and asked if he would be willing to look at that. He was, I got a home office set up a few months later, and I&#39;ve been with them ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth boys&#39; dads are in their lives, and I&#39;ve gotten regular child support all along (with a couple of exceptions, that were dealt with quickly). I have asked my friends for financial help several times. This wasn&#39;t a time that I could afford to be too proud to ask. I wouldn&#39;t have made it without that help. When I&#39;m more stable, I&#39;d love to set up an unschoolers help fund, a pot of money that would be used to help unschoolers in need. Right now, I need to focus on my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the past few months, I&#39;ve realized as grateful as I am for this job, I&#39;m not liking how unavailable I am as I&#39;m working. I can do things for the boys, take frequent breaks, there&#39;s a lot of flexibility with my hours... but there are still several hours every weekday that I&#39;m not available to really BE with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m working with a life coach to help me reach my dream job, which would let me be with the boys more, earning a lot more per hour so I could work fewer hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trusting that as their needs change, I can recognize that and change things up, go with the flow to make a life we all love.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s perfectly ours and it&#39;s really, really good. We need a car, now - I&#39;ve been without one for some time. My oldest has reached a point where he wants to be around people more, so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to make that happen. My youngest has always been social; we live in a neighborhood with kids his age so he&#39;s been able to play with them after their school time and on weekends. We would all benefit from being around unschoolers more, so I&#39;m keeping my eyes out for a miracle vehicle, and in the meantime learning how to save. I&#39;ve had to grow up a lot, in a lot of different ways, to make this work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s been an undercurrent lately in some unschooling messages that if you don&#39;t have a perfect life, you&#39;re not doing your kids any favors by unschooling. I call bulls**t. My boys love unschooling, and the freedom it provides. It&#39;s not just for privileged, two-parent families.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey see through their schooled friends what they would have dealt with in school, and are very grateful to have lived our unconventional life instead. We talk a lot about choices - we just had to take our kitty to the vet, and sadly, had to have him put down. Before we took him in, the boys said they&#39;d rather pay the vet bill than the cable bill; he was definitely more important than Nicktoons Network and the DVR. Would I like to provide both? Yes, and I&#39;m seeing if I can get some extra hours to do that. But if I can&#39;t, it will be OK, we&#39;ll work it out.

We kept expecting him to do dishes and reminding him to do them, and it gradually began to seem, to all of us, more like nagging than reminding. He started doing less dishes, and doing a half-a&#39;ed job. So we stopped reminding, stopped even mentioning dishes. George and I were imediately happier - we weren&#39;t nagging any more! Doing the dishes stopped being an Issue. It was probably a year, though, before Ray washed a dish again. Now he&#39;ll walk into the kitchen and start doing dishes entirely on his own.

After my ex moved out, I took a bit of<br/>\ntime to recover my equilibrium, then I got a part time job, I was only<br/>\nworking 15-20 hours a week and I hated it. I can understand why you are so<br/>\noverwhelmed with you working 2 jobs! What Ren said about her friend getting<br/>\ncreative in ways to make income is a great idea. Are there things that you<br/>\nlike to do that could bring you a decent income, but allow you to be home<br/>\nmore, therefore having more time for yourself, your kids and your house? I<br/>\ngot my certification to be a Postpartum Doula and to teach infant soothing<br/>\nclasses. I can set my own schedule and not work more than 20 hours a week,<br/>\nyet still bring in a good income. Definitely worth looking into. It&#39;s so<br/>\nworth it to be able to find a way to enjoy the Now!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think the advice that Deb gave was great also. Do you know how he is<br/>\nfeelingand have you talked to him about what you&#39;re feeling? I don&#39;t know<br/>\nhow long you&#39;ve been a single parent, but you might be suprised the affect<br/>\non him. Once I went to work part-time, my girls had a hard time. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe divorce that was hard for them, but me being gone. I had been a stay at<br/>\nhome mom their whole lives, and my older daughter, Kianne, took on too much<br/>\nresponsibility while I was away, that was very hard on her. That was when I<br/>\ndecided to quit and focus on my own businesses. Now, I know when I do go to<br/>\nwork, (I keep putting it off, lol) we will handle it better this time<br/>\naround!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just this year that my girls and I have settled into really living<br/>\nunschooling and it is a huge relief to all of us. I found that after a bit<br/>\nof time, I didn&#39;t mind that I was the one doing the majority of the work, it<br/>\nwas actually better. I wasn&#39;t nagging, creating an unhappy environment for<br/>\nall of us. Now, when I am feeling overwhelmed and need some help, I just<br/>\nask, I usually get a more than willing yes from one or both of them. Now<br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t being made to do &quot;chores&quot;, and honestly there weren&#39;t that<br/>\nmany prior to our unschooling discovery, they do what they do much easier<br/>\nand happier. And, now when I clean up, unless it&#39;s the kitchen, they hate<br/>\ndoing the kitchen, lol, they will often help pick up as I am doing, or start<br/>\na load of laundry when we are running out of clothes, things like that. Plus<br/>\nthe fact that we are all ok living in a fairly messy house, occasionally<br/>\ndoing a great clean, which is mostly done by me, but that&#39;s ok. It did take<br/>\ntime though, not only deschooling, but adjusting to this new life as a<br/>\ndifferent family. Which is now a much happier family!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helped a bit, feel free to ask more!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jun 2, 2009 at 9:22 AM, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br/>\n&gt; Amy Voss Dolce &lt;avd@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for all the responses.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I know that there are as many ways to unschool as there are families,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but I wondered how other single parent families approached<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschooling....<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Amy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My friend LeaAnn in Pensacola has unschooled three of her children for most<br/>\n&gt; of their lives (Aaron is now 22 I believe, so it&#39;s been a while).:)<br/>\n&gt; She wasn&#39;t single the entire time (her dh died over 10 years ago though)<br/>\n&gt; but most of those years.

I was a courier in CA for 7 mos.until 3 wks ago when we &quot;hit the road&quot; again.  WOOHOO!!!! Previously I was an OTR (Over The Road) truck driver and they were with me. The boys have been to every state, mostly just through them but a few highlights were visited i.e. Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, St Louis Arch, Graceland, Mall of America, Statue of Liberty & NYC, Canada, deserts, mtns, plains etc. We are now enjoying our time away from schedules and other time restraints.  We are currently tenting our way up and down from CA (Redwoods, Monterey Bay Aquarium) to OR(hit a few state parks), WA(LIFE is Good Unschooling Conference), ID(my best friend from HS days lives there now and was going to go to Yellowstone with us, visited Craters of the Moon Nat&#39;l Park), MT(Yellowstone), WY(Grand Tetons--currently doing laundry here while I&#39;m e-mailing you), UT (plans for Lagoon waterpark in SLC, Arches Nat&#39;l park & Bryce<br/>\n Canyon), NV(meeting some unschooling friends from CA who are getting their timeshare for 2 wks and wanted us to spend a wk with them there in Las Vegas), AZ, NM, TX & OK to finally get to our RV that I bought last year when we got off our truck in Aug. we then went to the Bahamas for the boys b-day on a cruise and then headed off in the wild blue yonder.  My sister had some health issues which took us to CA to be with her and where we were &quot;stuck&quot; for those 8 mos of which 7 I had a j-o-b.  It sucked!  LOL  Now we are back to being even more free!! On June 24th we are going to be in Baltimore, MD to set up a fireworks booth for only 10 days in which we will profit $ 3,000-5,000.  We belong to yahoo group called FOTR (Families on the Road) and there I&#39;ve found alot helpful info and guidance in being able to earn some income while doing what we love.......travel! The boys have made friends everywhere and stay in touch with them either in person<br/>\n when passing through somewhere or their cell phones or miraculously the internet!!  I am also owner/moderator to an unschooling group for single parents, which is deathly slow. <br/>\nSooooo I hope that&#39;s been helpful info into what WE do as a single unschooling family who are just living our life, and enjoying it.  If you have more questions feel free to e-mail me privately but I think I&#39;ve given enough info here. :)  Good luck on your journey........maybe we&#39;ll meet along the way!  <br/>\n <br/>\nJana --unschooling myself and living life fully with my 2 awesome guys Jake (13) & Josh (11)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 6/2/09, Amy Voss Dolce &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:avd@...\">avd@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all the responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there are as many ways to unschool as there are families, <br/>\nbut I wondered how other single parent families approached <br/>\nunschooling. ...<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155775465,"authorName":"Amy Voss Dolce","from":"Amy Voss Dolce &lt;avd@...&gt;","profile":"momofonespirit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Asking for help","postDate":"1243949753","msgId":40375,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyOTM3RTFFLTU0MTItNEU5OC1CRjU5LTY0RkQwM0NDNjVBMEB0YWNvbmljLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":40357,"nextInTopic":40377,"prevInTime":40374,"nextInTime":40376,"topicId":40312,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for all the responses.

You say, &quot;I am working two jobs and am the only one in the household and do everything ( and do not have the time I had when I was married and not working to devote to him- but this is another issue)&quot; and in that phrase I can really hear a sense of isolation, loss, and frustration with having to be totally independent. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, perhaps you could simply share your feelings and needs with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say, &quot;I am feeling resentful, desperate, and disappointed which tells me that I&#39;ve got some unmet needs.  I think those needs are for support and empathy.  Sometimes I come to you to meet those needs.  Although, you know, it may be up to me to find a way to get those needs meet somewhere else.  I&#39;d take any ideas or help you have to offer me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might be surprised to find out that he shares these needs with you, or that he has other needs he&#39;s been keeping inside as well that he decides to share with you now that you&#39;ve opened up to him.  After all, he suffered a loss as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTogether the two of you may come up with a strategy to help meet your needs for support and empathy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, you may have to come up with the strategy on your own.  After all, you are responsible for meeting your own needs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, he may stew on what you&#39;ve said and come up with his own strategy to meet your needs, which can be such a delicious surprise as it will come straight from his heart to yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let go of asking for help around the house, and instead, open up to him with your feelings and needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Asking for help","postDate":"1243678157","msgId":40327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDMTA2RTI4LUMwNDctNERERS04QTE0LTM3MDVDMTM1Q0JDQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2b2xlNStrZHJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd2b2xlNStrZHJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40312,"nextInTopic":40328,"prevInTime":40326,"nextInTime":40328,"topicId":40312,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
