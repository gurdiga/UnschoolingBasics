But in thinking about the<br/>\ncontrol in my family, I came up with the possibility<br/>\nthat it might be more fear than control.  Meaning that<br/>\nthe fear is stemming from keeping up with the Jonese<br/>\nor the law or whatever.  And of course, those fears<br/>\nget handed down generation to generation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Glad you woke up and started making your children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; feelings more<br/>\n&gt; important than the extended family!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hehe...I&#39;ve been awake.  I remember back in high<br/>\nschool telling my best friend that I am never sending<br/>\nmy kids to school and that I&#39;ll be home with them all<br/>\nday, every day; baking cookies, going to the park, tra<br/>\nla la la la....  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt guess was because I just couldn&#39;t find the right<br/>\nwords to explain my position or they just didn&#39;t<br/>\nlisten.  Who knows, but THEN after 42 years of life,I<br/>\ncome to find out, (insert lightbulb here), it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmy voice after all! &lt;g&gt;  It was the ACTIONS that I<br/>\ntook with my kids. <br/>\nOk now all say it with me....Actions speak louder than<br/>\nwords.  LOL!  I know you all were thinking it. ;p  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just did it.  Like jumping into a pool. <br/>\nThey freaked; John acted like Fred Sanford going to<br/>\nmeet Elizabeth, Mom wrung her hands and fretted at me,<br/>\nIn-laws threatened to never speak to me again, blah...<br/>\nBut everyone is backing off now that they see the kids<br/>\naren&#39;t dead or had their brains ooze out of their ears<br/>\nfrom lack of school.  They see happy, confident kids<br/>\nwith minds of their own (staying in their skull). <br/>\nEww..gross I know. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway...Hope and I are off today to go to the dog<br/>\npark to see who we can meet.  She came up with that<br/>\nidea. :D <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a Happy Saturday!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does education often do?
