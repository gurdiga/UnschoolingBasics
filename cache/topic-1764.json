Eggs are cheap. They aren&#39;t worth harming <br/>\nthe fragile emotions of a child.<br/>\nGo buy two dozen really cheap eggs. Throw them against a tree, or <br/>\ndrop them from a deck. Tell her that eggs can be replaced, but she <br/>\ncan&#39;t and that the important thing is the love you all share. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your dh is going to get really pissed about eggs, I have to warn <br/>\nyou, the older children get, the more expensive the breaks!:)<br/>\nWe&#39;ve lost windows, fragile things, food (hell, Jalen dumped a $7 <br/>\nbag of dried blueberries today) and eventually CARS.<br/>\nIt&#39;s just stuff.<br/>\nTrevor made a huge error and left $2,000 worth of camera and video <br/>\nequipment on the back of my car, when he was supposed to put it IN <br/>\nthe car. It was all destroyed...all but one really old camera. I <br/>\nstill mourn for my equipment! But as he cried, knowing how much it <br/>\nsaddened me to lose it, I simply hugged him and said &quot;Trevor, these <br/>\nkind of things happen in life, it&#39;s stuff I loved, but it&#39;s stuff I <br/>\ncan replace. I&#39;m really, really glad nothing bad happened to one of <br/>\nyou, I can&#39;t replace the people I love.&quot; and also &quot;that camera <br/>\nequipment could never be as important as your feelings, you matter <br/>\nmore to me than anything I own.&quot;<br/>\nIt helped a lot. He already felt absolutely horrible. There was no <br/>\nreplacing that equipment by making him feel worse!  If you live to <br/>\nbe my age, and not destroy something valuable, plus a lot of <br/>\ninvaluable things, then you are unusual. You might as well accept <br/>\nthese accidents as part of life, and allow her the freedom of <br/>\nknowing she is still a good, wonderful person, in spite of making <br/>\nmistakes.<br/>\n{{{{{Thanks Ren, for this post! }}}}}}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1762,"nextTopicId":1542}}
