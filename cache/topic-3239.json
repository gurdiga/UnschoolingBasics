Go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a> <br/>\nto join. This is a place to talk about all those toddler issues and <br/>\nunschooling your pre-school aged children whether you have older <br/>\nunschooled children or are just starting your unschooling journey. Below <br/>\nis the list description:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Are you Unschooling small children? Do you find yourself ducking <br/>\nquestions about when your kids will start preschool, kindergarten or <br/>\ntelling people that you&#39;ve already made the commitment to homeschool? <br/>\nCome join us for a discussion of Unschooling in the early years!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Unschooling becomes more widespread, the deliberate choice to <br/>\nUnschool comes early as a way to fend off pressure for Head-Start, <br/>\nPreschool and Pre-K<br/>\nprograms. Many mothers are emphatically resisting the push toward early <br/>\nacademics and choosing, instead to nurture freedom, joy, childhood and <br/>\nnatural learning, trusting that their children will learn all they <br/>\ngenuinely need to know-- the very foundations of Unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nList owners are working to create a space in which Radical Unschooling <br/>\ncan be seriously discussed as it applies to young children. Although <br/>\nsecular in nature, we welcome unschoolers from all walks of life. Our <br/>\ndiscussions focus on exploring topics like natural learning, respectful <br/>\nparenting, joyful living, freedom and autonomy, living by principles, <br/>\nsingle parent unschooling, convincing family, surviving panic and <br/>\ncriticism, living without fear, resisting enrollment, non-coercive <br/>\nparenting, deschooling ourselves, and letting go of controls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an on-topic list specifically dedicated to achieving a deeper <br/>\nunderstanding of a Radical Unschooling lifestyle as it applies to young <br/>\nchildren--topics that fall outside this description belong, please, on <br/>\nmore appropriate lists. This list is geared towards thoughtful <br/>\ndiscussion and exploration of what Radical Unschooling looks like in the <br/>\nearly years, from toddlerhood to around age 8 or so. Experienced and new <br/>\nUnschoolers can discuss how they made the transition from peaceful <br/>\nparenting to Unschooling in daily practice, when that transition <br/>\noccurred and what benefits children gain by Unschooling from the <br/>\nbeginning. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re very excited about creating a space where we can seriously discuss <br/>\nUnschooling small children and the many, many benefits children gain <br/>\nfrom being Always Unschooled. We hope you&#39;ll join us!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3147,"nextTopicId":3242}}
