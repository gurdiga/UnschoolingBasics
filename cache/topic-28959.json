I am again organizing the Homeschool Valentine<br/>\nExchange. This exchange is done by mail and we usually exchange with<br/>\nchildren from many states. It is a good geography lesson as<br/>\nwell..since most families use a map to locate where they are sending<br/>\nthem too and then when they receive the valentine, they mark it on the<br/>\nmap or post it in an area close to where it came from if you use a<br/>\nvery large map. Also,along with your valentine card, please include<br/>\nsomething about the area you live in...is it in the mountains? or near<br/>\nwater? large city? small town? what is it famous for? just a fact or 2<br/>\nabout where you live. <br/>\nolder children and or teens often participate to make a little list or<br/>\nparagraph or picture of things in their area as well as a small card<br/>\nthey either buy or make. They usually don&#39;t care for the mushy<br/>\nparts..just different areas that they get a response from!If we get<br/>\nalot of response from the older and younger children we will break it<br/>\nup into age groups: middle and high school ages and elementary school<br/>\nages. But it works out in the end! It is alot of fun for the children.<br/>\nUsually, cards that go to one family will be mailed in one envelope,<br/>\nbut with the correct amount of cards...one per child.<br/>\nMaking the cards count as art as well! This is open to homeschoolers<br/>\neverywhere! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to participate, please email me by Jan. 31st at :<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:oceanblue_1000@...\">oceanblue_1000@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease include the following with your emailed response:<br/>\n1. Your name,<br/>\n2. Your child(rens) name(s),<br/>\n3 .child(rens) ages(in case we break it up into older and youngers if<br/>\nwe get alot of responses),<br/>\n4 .email address<br/>\n5. Postal Mailing address<br/>\n<br/>\nI will compose a list from the emails as they come into me and will be<br/>\nsending each person a copy of it by email around Feb 3 .<br/>\n<br/>\nPebs</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28980,"nextTopicId":29013}}
