It&#39;s title is &quot;The Hidden Feelings of Motherhood&quot; by <br/>\nKathleen A. Kendall-Tackett, PH.D., and I found it highly <br/>\nenlightening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis particular book, unlike any I&#39;ve previously read, broaches <br/>\ntough subjects and *feelings* that are relevant to current <br/>\ndiscussions here.  I think every woman could benefit from reading <br/>\nthis book, but highly recommend it for anyone that is the survivor <br/>\nof abuse in any form and/or anyone with a spirited child.  Also, <br/>\nanyone that has ever lost a child.  The chapter line-up is as <br/>\nfollows:<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 1   Stress<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 2   Depression<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 3   Burnout<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 4   Hearth and Home<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 5   For Love or Money<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 6   Less Work for Mother<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 7   So Tired<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 8   The Long Shadow<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 9   Challenging Child I<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 10  Challenging Child II<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 11  Hello-Goodbye<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned this is NOT an unschooling book.  It is a book about <br/>\nthe history of motherhood.  It is a book about noticing the <br/>\npositive.  It is a book of resources.  It is a book with insight and <br/>\ninspiration and tools.  It is a book supportive of &quot;Mindful <br/>\nParenting&quot; which goes along with current discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope anyone that is interested finds it as beneficial to read as I <br/>\ndid.  Enjoy...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15840,"nextTopicId":15847}}
