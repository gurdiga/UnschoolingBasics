My first spouse was(is) a manic depressive, who was(is) violent.  I beg you to seek counsiling as nothing good comes from the rages.  Yes, the kids could cool the rough-housing, yes, his needs can be met better (maybe).  But as someone who has lived the life of walking on eggshells, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.  In four years of marriage, he shattered 16 doors.  The list is long and sad and violent.  The ex has gotten much (much, much) worse even though we live far away now. (We keep a constant watch out for him, still, as he said he was going to kill us.)  My only advise is to prepare for the what if&#39;s and make a plan.  Then put down the ultimatum.  This stops!  Get help! Or we leave!  My daughter (and I) still carries the emotional scares from her father&#39;s temper and threats.

Your post suggests that some life  changes have <br/>\nincreased his anger outbursts. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen looking for so possible solutions, please consider this and find a  <br/>\ntherapist who will consider the possibility.  While it is important for you  and <br/>\nyour husband to work together to create a nurturing home,  change  needs to <br/>\nhappen within him and not with you changing the environment for  him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nEmotional abuse of this kind that causes a child to be frightened of their  <br/>\nfather can have life long consequences.  It&#39;s very easy to make excuses for  <br/>\nthe abuser and also to think that your actions can keep it from happening  <br/>\nagain.  I grew up in a home like this and was in a marriage like this  without <br/>\nunderstanding the damage it caused to both me and eventually my  children.  There <br/>\nare answers but it may take a considerable amount of time,  money and energy <br/>\non both of your parts to find what works for you.

He doesn&#39;t like roughhousing  <br/>\nand running through the house, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about that. Or  <br/>\nmaybe it is and he&#39;s sucking it up as long as he can stand, and  <br/>\nlosing it. I really think it&#39;s about him needing a break, and needing  <br/>\nto feel listened to. If he&#39;s working all day, and then needs time to  <br/>\nrelax, then there should be a meeting to discuss how that can happen.  <br/>\nMaybe he  needs to stop at a coffee shop once or twice a week before  <br/>\nhe gets home to unwind.  Maybe the kids could just not run while he&#39;s  <br/>\nhome. Maybe they could be gently reminded to take it outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have lots of reasons why roughhousing does not occur in our four  <br/>\nwalls. Primarily because we have a baby and a toddler who have gotten  <br/>\nreally really hurt. We have an autistic daughter who can&#39;t handle the  <br/>\nnoise, and also tries to imitate and causes unintentional damage.  <br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about letting kids run wild, it&#39;s about considering  <br/>\nthe needs of everyone. You mentioned several issues that may be  <br/>\ncontributing, they should be taken into consideration as well. If dh  <br/>\nis sad, he needs extra help. If he lost his mother, then it&#39;s a great  <br/>\ntime to explain to the kids, &quot;Dad isn&#39;t feeling good today, he&#39;s sad.  <br/>\nCan we find a quieter way to play?&quot; Talk to dh and ask him to tell  <br/>\nyou guys before he&#39;s losing his temper that he can&#39;t handle loudness  <br/>\nright now. EIght is plenty old enough to understand other people&#39;s  <br/>\nfeelings, and old enough to brainstorm alternatives to place, time  <br/>\nand play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my house, i would talk to dh one night, after kids are asleep or  <br/>\nout on a date, and just say that we&#39;re not mind readers, and if he  <br/>\nneeds something, he can talk about it. For a long time here, we  <br/>\ndismissed all adult needs and it really does not work well.

He&#39;s never hit them,<br/>\nbut has threatened once (by holding up his fist to my older daughter).<br/>\n I&#39;ve been with him over 24 years, and he has never hitten me, either.<br/>\n My older daughter (who is 8 yo.) says he&#39;s scary, but that she knows<br/>\nhe wouldn&#39;t hurt her physically.<br/>\n<br/>\n In all the time that I&#39;ve been with my husband, since he was a teen,<br/>\nhe rarely lost his temper, though, since we&#39;ve had kids (especially 2<br/>\nkids), it has increased.  Also, my husband&#39;s mom died a little over a<br/>\nyear ago and his anger has seemed to have significantly increased<br/>\nsince her death.  He also has a very stressful job that he really<br/>\nhates.  We&#39;ve looked for other jobs, but haven&#39;t found one that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require at least a significant drop in pay (and currently we<br/>\nhave too much debt to consider a large reduction in his pay, though,<br/>\nwe are trying to pay off the debt so this can eventually happen). <br/>\nHowever, we will continue to look for a job.  He also sees a therapist<br/>\nevery now and then, and although this helps, it is limited in value.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I&#39;m at a loss.  I&#39;ve tried to empathize, but maybe it&#39;s too<br/>\nlittle too late.  How can I let my kids be kids without my husband<br/>\nlosing his temper?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nAnon poster<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18096,"nextTopicId":18111}}
