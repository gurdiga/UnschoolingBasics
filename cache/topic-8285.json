I still get it and usually  over <br/>\nthe slightest of things  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI deal with it several ways.  I have an unschooling friend that I call  and <br/>\nwe have a good laugh about it.  Or I get on these lists and read  archives or <br/>\nget on Joyce&#39;s list and read.  Print out some &quot;inspiration&quot; and  keep them <br/>\nhandy.<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps the best thing is to stop what you are doing and go sit with your  <br/>\nkids.  See them through the eyes of unconditional love, not as the &quot;sole  source <br/>\nof their education&quot;.  Relax and have fun.  Go someplace new or  watch a <br/>\nvideo.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and Kelly would say &quot;go to the Live and Learn Conference next  year&quot;.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247861255,"authorName":"homeschoolcrew6","from":"&quot;homeschoolcrew6&quot; &lt;homeschoolcrew6@...&gt;","profile":"homeschoolcrew6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"newbie with of course questions.","postDate":"1134475670","msgId":8285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRubWRpbStmbW9zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8292,"prevInTime":8284,"nextInTime":8286,"topicId":8285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello I am new to the group and just thought I would send in a little intro.
