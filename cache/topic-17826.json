Her goal is for uncensored<br/>\ndiscussion and respectful exchanges. She just opened the site<br/>\nyesterday morning. Please consider suggesting it to anyone who might<br/>\nbe interested.

We are committed to making waves.<br/>\nPeaceful, loving waves that change the world-powerful in their<br/>\nkindness and compassion. There are a multitude of perspectives on how<br/>\nto achieve peace. This is a place for sharing challenges and ideas<br/>\nwith others who share our ideals of a non-violent world. We can learn<br/>\nfrom each other in an atmosphere of mutual respect for our common<br/>\ngoals. Our alternative points of view will demand debate and<br/>\nstretching our mental and emotional boundaries. However, namecalling<br/>\nand hateful exchanges are not welcome in our shared efforts for<br/>\ncreating peace. Peaceful exchanges will be encouraged and openly<br/>\nsupported. All concerns regarding hateful posts may be brought to the<br/>\nattention of administration. All moderation involvement will be done<br/>\nopenly and without secrecy. Please feel welcome to contact<br/>\nadministration regarding your concerns at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is expected that people will not agree with all the ideas found<br/>\nhere. An open mind, tolerance for differences and a willingness to<br/>\nexplore and learn are strongly suggested as prerequisites to<br/>\nparticipating here. Most members have experienced a paradigm shift in<br/>\nthinking and that means that on the surface that our cultural context<br/>\nwill be a limitation to growth and understanding. If this is not the<br/>\nplace for you, please let us discuss our lives in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for joining us in discussing the political, socio-economic,<br/>\nreligious, cultural and parenting beliefs associated with creating a<br/>\npeaceful world together.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has open registration.
