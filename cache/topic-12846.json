Then do it *once* for his <br/>\ndad! On a *good* day! As good as Cameron became at magic, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nBen *really* misses it as Cam&#39;s all-consuming passion. I do! :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n  Luckily, he traded magic for music and film, passions Ben can enjoy! <br/>\n&lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think there&#39;s a real possibility that he could be made to feel bad <br/>\nabout his passion.

He didn&#39;t realize how valuable that one <br/>\ncard was. There were a couple of older kids who kind of kept an eye on <br/>\na few of the ...ummm...trickier kids.

I am trying to find<br/>\n other venues for playing with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n  Try Barnes & Noble or other gaming stores. Dragons & Heroes here in <br/>\ntown has huge Saturday tournaments. Another baseball trading store has <br/>\nonce a month tournaments.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For Duncan&#39;s birthday this year, we had a Yu-Gi-Oh! party. We emptied <br/>\nthe music studio of instruments and put up Yu-Gi posters. We set up <br/>\nseveral tables for play and got an older boy to be the judge. I had <br/>\ndecks of cards as prizes and smaller packs and Yu-Gi pencils and wrist <br/>\nbands and such as favors. We played _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie_ DVD in the <br/>\nbackground. We had origami paper and manga drawing books with plenty of <br/>\npaper for the non-players. We served rice balls, tuna and cucumber roll <br/>\nmaki, teriyaki chicken, and Japanese sweets---all with chop sticks. We <br/>\nhad a Yu-Gi cake. Duncan wore his kimono and his sandals. We had a <br/>\nYu-Gi pinata! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  To show you that&#39;s not even far enough! ---Duncan has a Yu-Gi-Oh! <br/>\nroom. I painted the walls a royal blue. One wall has a 5&#39;X5&#39; full-color <br/>\nYu-Gi on it. The opposite wall has a Three-headed Blue-eyes Ultimate <br/>\nDragon (8&#39;X10&#39;). Other walls have smaller figures of the Dark Magician, <br/>\nDark Magician Girl, Karibo, and some freaky bat! He has a Yu-Gi <br/>\nbedspread and pillow cases and a blanket.<br/>\n<br/>\n  His room *was* a Batman room before---with a glow-in-the-dark <br/>\nbatsignal, a batmobile, and Gotham City painted on the walls! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n I really do believe in feeding passions! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe show this to your husband---maybe he&#39;ll see *your* son&#39;s <br/>\ninterest as normal once he sees how crazy *I* am! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously---this will NOT last forever. He&#39;ll move on to another <br/>\npassion. Be as supportive as your budget allows. It&#39;s relatively cheap, <br/>\nas passions go! He&#39;s learning all SORTS of cool things: patterning, <br/>\nsequencing, categorizing, reading (and *tiny* print, at that! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>\nmanaging money, caring for his psoessions. GOOD, IMPORTANT STUFF!<br/>\n<br/>\nEnable him!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh! And enjoy it while you got it. You&#39;re going to miss it when it&#39;s <br/>\ngone!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s the *next* passion going to be? &lt;g&gt; Your husband may be begging <br/>\nhim to go back to Yu-Gi!

No limits.  This &quot;finding value&quot; and limiting in the cards sounds much like the conversations about video games I&#39;ve heard so often.  To bring/force mainstream educational values in something he enjoys just serves to cheapen his interest.  If he was interested in plumbing (in that it&#39;s a skill that has common value outside of educational norms), would you limit him??  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Maybe you could strew some Yu Gi Oh things to broaden his interest.  There&#39;s a Yu Gi Oh video game for PS2 which my son enjoys.  There are puzzles, stickers, books, drawing books, toys, a dueling deck, and more, I&#39;m sure.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  To connect with others who play Yu Gi Oh, try asking at the library if they know of a group or at the toy store (not Wal Mart, but a toy store.  Our local KB Toyworks has groups posted).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  For your dh, try explaining it in terms of something he really likes.  My dh is glued to the TV now with basketball playoffs.  He watches them freely, no limits, no barraging, no nagging (I don&#39;t even ask him to take out the trash!!  LOL!!).  Your son&#39;s passion deserves the same respect.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Fwiw, my 9yo son loves video games.  Some days &quot;that&#39;s all he does&quot;.  We&#39;ve learned to read from them, we&#39;ve learned value, numbers, community, and *much* more.  At first, to &quot;allow&quot; my dh to connect to what was going on, I pointed out the &quot;educational&quot; value to the games (not to mention thinking skills!!!).  Once he saw the mainstream value, he was able to let go a little easier.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  HTH!!<br/>\n  Jane Powell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nHow low will we go?
