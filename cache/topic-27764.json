As I said I am learning. I was a public school girl and I never thought it would be so hard to change my ways of thinking in that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter (the one who has the rabbits) was born at 22 weeks gestation and 1.5lbs. She is perfect other than mild cerebral palsy (which you wouldn&#39;t even know she had unless you saw her run). She is intelligent beyond her years. At 2 she knew all her colors, shapes (including hexagon, pentagon, cresent and oval), letters not only by sight but by name and knew that Mommy started with the letter M and Daddy started with the letter D. She has read The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe at least twice on her own. Her vocabulary is beyond even my abilities. She has a 7 year old body but a mind of so much older in a lot of ways. It gets hard sometimes to remember she is only 7. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways- someone posted and said that I should take over the responsibility of the rabbits entirely and let her help when she wants to. She will watch me taking care of them and learn that way. They also said how she showed and interest in something and how I am now punishing her with them. That floored me and got me to thinking. I know this sounds silly but I just never thought of taking care of them for her and allowing her to help if she wanted to. So this morning I asked her if she wanted me to take care of the rabbits completely and she said yes. She was worried that if I did it all that it meant that we would give the rabbits away. I felt so bad and started crying. I never ever ever meant for it to be that way. I just had the public school mentality of they want it then they do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI thank everyone of you for emailing me. My parents expected way more of me as a child. More than any child at my age should of handled. I&#39;m trying to get out of that mindset. Thank you for the being truthful with me. That&#39;s the only way I learn! <br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly <br/>\nhappily taking care of all the animals now! Ha ha!

DH would help out (his help was particularly good<br/>\nfor filling the self-watering thing because it&#39;s heavy) but I handled<br/>\nfeeding and cleaning the yard and vet appointments and all. Over time,<br/>\nDS has learned how much to feed and all and he&#39;ll just do it sometimes -<br/>\ntypically I feed the dog when I leave in the morning and when I get home<br/>\nin the evening. But, some evenings I&#39;ll get home and DS is already<br/>\nfeeding the dog - not as a chore or responsibility but as a -gift- to<br/>\nme. For that matter, he&#39;ll sometimes feed the fish as well - he asked to<br/>\nhave fish and we worked it out to finally fit it into things BUT we<br/>\nnever required that he be their sole provider/caretaker (and he was 8<br/>\nwhen we got the fish). <br/>\n <br/>\nAs others have said, a 7 yr old is really NOT ready to handle sole<br/>\nresponsibility for that many living creatures - even one bunny as a pet<br/>\nis a LOT of responsibility. As an &quot;assistant&quot;, sure but not as the<br/>\nprimary caregiver. If the adults in the household are not willing to<br/>\nhandle the majority of it, it needs a major rethinking. Also, why is it<br/>\nthat the rabbits &quot;have to&quot; be fed/watered/cleaned up after first thing<br/>\nin the morning? Would it be less of a struggle if the bunny care could<br/>\nhappen before lunch (for example)? I&#39;m guessing the rabbits don&#39;t care -<br/>\nthey&#39;ll adjust to whatever schedule you set up. Maybe revisit the idea<br/>\n(sounds like a tape from way back when in your head) that &quot;chores&quot; must<br/>\nbe done first thing as soon as you get up. Why is that? Does it make a<br/>\ndifference WHEN (or IF) her bed gets made? Does it even really matter,<br/>\nif you&#39;re not going out of the house, when she gets dressed? Many a day<br/>\nmy DS (he&#39;s 9 1/2) spends the day in PJs (and in summer that means<br/>\nbasically a pair of colorful boxers). I noted that her chores also<br/>\ninclude cats and hamsters. So, not only does your 7 yr old have total<br/>\nresponsibility for half a dozen rabbits but also the cats and hamsters?<br/>\nGood heavens! I don&#39;t even want to have responsibility for that many<br/>\ncritters - we&#39;ve got two tanks of fish and a dog that has free access to<br/>\nthe outdoors (electric fence and doggie door) and that&#39;s about all we<br/>\nwant to deal with.

Pretend today is the last day you<br/>\nhave with her and maybe the whole project will seem like a fun thing<br/>\nto share. She is more important than those rabbits and she needs to<br/>\nknow you are on her side.

We bought them for her and told her that if she would like to<br/>\nearn some money she could get up to 8 females and one male. We would<br/>\nbuy all the cages, water bottles, feeders, rabbits, two bags of food,<br/>\none bale of hay and then let her loose with it. She is going to leave<br/>\nthe male in with one female for a week and then rotate him so they can<br/>\nall have babies. She will then take the babies (once they are old<br/>\nenough) to the auction to sell and whatever she makes there will be<br/>\nher own money. From that money she has to turn around and buy more<br/>\nfood and bedding for them. She has to clean out their cages, etc. We<br/>\nwill help her but we will NOT do everything for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far as I said we have 6 rabbits (4 female, 2 males- one male given<br/>\nto us by a friend that is neutered), 2 cages (one is separted into 2<br/>\nto technically make it 3 cages) and water bottles, feeders, bedding<br/>\nfor all. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe goes to bed when she wants, gets up when she wants and takes<br/>\nforever to do her chores. Don&#39;t yell at me or send me nasty emails. I<br/>\nam still learning. Her chores are making her bed, getting dressed,<br/>\nfeeding the cats, feeding and getting fresh water for the rabbits and<br/>\nfood and water for her hamsters. It is taking her forever to do her<br/>\nchores once she wakes up. She wants to lay in my bed, hug on me (which<br/>\nI love) but then she doesn&#39;t get anything done and I will not allow<br/>\nthose rabbits to sit out there hungry and thirsty while she gets her<br/>\ntummy filled. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nKimberly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27809,"nextTopicId":27789}}
