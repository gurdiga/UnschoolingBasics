It&#39;s about living<br/>\nlife and the learning that naturally results from that. Unschoolers<br/>\ndon&#39;t learn math for the purpose of maybe needing it one day, we<br/>\nsimply do what we love and as we do those things, we learn<br/>\nmath/reading/history etc... We learn new things to facilitate doing<br/>\nwhat we love. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo forget about math, or workbooks or anything schoolish and be on<br/>\nVACATION, starting right now.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, instead of telling your child to look spelling up in the<br/>\ndictionary, just BE her resource.  Much better that they can trust you<br/>\nto tell them the answer when they need it, than to struggle with<br/>\nlooking it up. If YOU don&#39;t know the answer, look it up for them/with<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI swear my kids have all learned how to spell by yelling &quot;Mom, how do<br/>\nyou spell ________?&quot; from the computer. That&#39;s it. I do a lot of<br/>\nspelling for them, keeps me on my toes!:) <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the journey, and welcome to the list Penny!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16617,"nextTopicId":16629}}
