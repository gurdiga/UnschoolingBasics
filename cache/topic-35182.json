I think Family Guy is like<br/>\n&gt; All in the Family in that they address a lot of social issues in ways<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; are meaning to SOME people. Yes, they&#39;re vulgar and many people<br/>\n&gt; cringe...but that shouldn&#39;t dismiss all of the topics they do touch<br/>\n&gt; on...drinking, sexism, ageism, ableism...the list goes on. &lt;snip&gt; They<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; parody societal norms to such an extreme that perhaps someone who<br/>\n&gt; appreciates subtle humor would no longer be amused.

It seeks to<br/>\n&gt; throw a humorous spotlight on our frailties, prejudices, and concerns.<br/>\n&gt; By making them a source of laughter we hope to show, in a mature<br/>\n&gt; fashion, just how absurd they are.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All in the Family was notorious for featuring language and epithets<br/>\n&gt; previously absent from television, such as &quot;fag&quot; for homosexual, &quot;hebe&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for Jews, &quot;spic&quot; for Hispanics, &quot;dago&quot; and &quot;wop&quot; for Italians, &quot;chink&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for Asians, &quot;spade&quot; for Blacks, and phrases such as &quot;God damn it.&quot; It<br/>\n&gt; was also famous for being the first major television show to feature<br/>\n&gt; the sound of a flushing toilet; it became a running gag on the show.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; While moral watchdogs attacked the show on those grounds, others<br/>\n&gt; objected to the show&#39;s portrayal of Archie Bunker as a &quot;lovable&quot; bigot.<br/>\n&gt; Defenders of the series pointed out that Archie usually lost his<br/>\n&gt; arguments by reason of his own stupidity.<br/>\n&gt; **********************<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, except maybe that &quot;in a mature fashion&quot; part. &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s dumb to them, there are more<br/>\n&gt; appropriate ways to phrase that one does not appreciate the humor or<br/>\n&gt; the topic in the show.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=--=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree. I groan PLENTY at Family Guy....but I find myself laughing<br/>\n&gt; often just seconds later.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Dumb&quot; it is NOT. It&#39;s VERY clever and smart. Painful and gross and<br/>\n&gt; absurd and grosser a LOT. Not dumb.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It tends to be on the &quot;boy side&quot; of humor. &lt;g&gt; Lots of potty<br/>\n&gt; references-----and boys (even 46 year old ones &lt;g&gt;) really dig that.<br/>\n&gt; But they *do* challenge society---and the music and historical<br/>\n&gt; references are fabulous.

My mother hated All in the Family but it was one of daddy&#39;s favorites so we all watched it. The Simpsons, Southpark, etc all of them have some merit if nothing else to open the floor to conversation and quite a bit of laughter. As for sex being taboo discussion, I can sympathize. My mother was very conservative and my father was not. So I did have an outlet. My husband and I also decided years ago that we wanted our children to be able to talk to either one of us about anything. So we have simply told them to ask what ever questions they have on any topic and we will answer them to the best of our ability. My daughter is comfortable talking to her daddy about growing up and hopefully my son will be as comfortable with me when he begins getting older.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the discussions we have had over these shows have been quite interesting and insightful. I honestly love to sit back and look at the world as brand new through the eyes of our children.

Some things he laughs at just because *we* do <br/>\nor because the laugh track says, &quot;Laugh NOW!&quot; But a lot of it gets <br/>\nquestioned. He&#39;s not shy about asking! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily Guy, Futurama, South Park, The Simpsons, and American Dad (my <br/>\nleast favorite) can lead to ALL open season on sex and all sorts of <br/>\nsocial issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen answering questions (and watching the shows with them), try really <br/>\nhard not to *look* flustered or embarrassed or confused. &lt;g&gt; Just SAY <br/>\nit. Laughing about it really helps. If you get angry or turned off, <br/>\nthey don&#39;t necessarily know *what* you&#39;re angry about. If we can laugh <br/>\nand enjoy it, it&#39;s easier to chat about. Clamming up about something <br/>\nthey enjoy makes them clam up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply waiting for children to bring it up may result in its never <br/>\nhappening. If it doesn&#39;t come naturally to the parents, the parents <br/>\nneed to make an environment which IS natural. Family Guy can get you in <br/>\nthat environment by remote control. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUse it. Abuse it. Make it yours! &lt;G&gt; OWN those shows. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-===-<br/>\n<br/>\nSex was definitely not talked about around my house when I was growing <br/>\nup but I<br/>\nwanted to do things differently as a parent.

Must be time for me to put in my two cents worth. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone who&#39;s been reading here for a couple of years has probably seen my<br/>\nposts about just this topic (South Park, too).  I can&#39;t stand Family Guy --<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t enough adjectives in the English language for me to adequately<br/>\nexpress my dislike for this show -- but my kids love it.  They watch it.<br/>\nThey DVR it and watch the same episodes over and over and over again... I<br/>\nrarely sit and watch it with them, tho I&#39;m usually nearby and can hear the<br/>\ndialogue.  When I hear something I&#39;d like to comment on, I often say &quot;Do you<br/>\nget why that joke was funny?&quot; which gives me the opening to discuss the<br/>\ncontext of the joke, the historical aspects, and how it relate to current<br/>\nissues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Family Guy and South Park (Simpsons, too, but I like them) we&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked about all kinds of things that otherwise may not have come up in day<br/>\nto day conversation. The topics parents are told they &#39;must&#39; talk about with<br/>\ntheir kids -- sex, drug, morals -- become just part of life instead of being<br/>\nheavily weighted sit-down conversations (lectures) with kids.  So, altho I<br/>\nreally can&#39;t stand Family Guy, I defend my kids&#39; right to watch it -- have<br/>\nto from time to time with my husband, who is even more offended by those<br/>\nshows than I am.  So much so that he can&#39;t see any value in them at all, but<br/>\nhe trusts me on this one.  He just has to leave the room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think it&#39;s perfectly okay for your kids to know you don&#39;t like a<br/>\nparticular show, or book or whatever.  We all have different tastes and<br/>\nopinions.  Just because I don&#39;t like a TV show doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s forbidden<br/>\nto them.  I have interests and passions my kids don&#39;t share, and likely<br/>\nnever will.  Different strokes for different folks. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, we&#39;ve asked them not to watch FG, SouthPark, or even The<br/>\nSimpsons when we&#39;re visiting the in-laws. It&#39;s just not worth the discomfort<br/>\nfor others, which allows even more discussion about consideration for<br/>\nothers, and why their grandparents feel as they do about the influences of<br/>\nTV on kids. They agreed that watching those shows when we visit grandparents<br/>\nor aunties (we&#39;ll be visiting both in CA in 3 wks) would just be more<br/>\ntrouble than it&#39;s worth.  We just DVR what they&#39;ll miss while we&#39;re gone and<br/>\nthey can have a Family Guy/South Park Marathon when we get home.  No big<br/>\ndeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n(Ren)<br/>\n<br/>\nSexual innuendos are only a problem if someone is uncomfortable with sex as<br/>\na topic. I think it&#39;s one of the best shows for making connections to tons<br/>\nof cultural references and musicals. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nRen, you know I love ya, but I have to disagree here.  I am very comfortable<br/>\nwith sex as a topic. Sometimes too comfortable. &lt;g&gt;  I can talk about with<br/>\nkids, friends, nursing Moms I just met. I&#39;ve talked about sex one-on-one and<br/>\nin groups, in private settings and not-so-private setting.  However, I don&#39;t<br/>\nfind any of the sex talk on Family Guy to be funny, or anything other than<br/>\noffensive and ugly.  My reaction is deeply visceral, but I can move above<br/>\nthat and manage to parlay that awful stuff into conversations about sex and<br/>\nrelationships, history and culture, because I think it&#39;s essential that our<br/>\nkids be aware of the connotations of sex in our culture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree the cultural references are great, downright invaluable in exposing<br/>\nand explaining so much about our world.  I seldom get the musical references<br/>\n(because I simply can&#39;t stand musicals), but I&#39;ve noticed that whenever<br/>\nWill&#39;s girlfriend is over she explains, for example, that a reference to<br/>\n&quot;pirates in pants&quot;  comes from Pirates of Penzance.  Then again, she is<br/>\nMusic Theory major who sings opera, so that aspect of entertainment is her<br/>\nforte.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, hey, if you really want your boundaries stretched on this topic, buy<br/>\nyour kids a copy of Grand Theft Auto!  So many opportunites to stretch and<br/>\ngrow. &lt;g&gt;  I am having conversations about things I never thought I&#39;d<br/>\ndiscuss with a 12yo boy, much less a 7yo boy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\nwww.ourhapahome365.blogspot.com<br/>\nwww.mysquareone.blogspot.com      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Family Guy","postDate":"1218144638","msgId":35203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwNzE0Mi40Mjk1MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35202,"nextInTopic":35204,"prevInTime":35202,"nextInTime":35204,"topicId":35182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oof, your e-mail feels so harsh.

Quagmire bugged me, he still does a bit. But watching Family Guy with Simon and Linnaea and David, oh, David&#39;s face splits in two he laughs so hard, I get it. And they love giggity, giggity, goo. Between a few friends of theirs and them it is a big joke. It is waning, but it was the funniest thing for a long time. I really love being able to decide that I want to find out what they like in something. Y&#39;know, sit and watch and pay attention and watch what gets them laughing or responding the most, and be there to talk about the huge number of cultural references that are going on in any episode, or whatever other conversation spins off from watching the episode. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would feel awful if I dismissed something that my children liked with the comment that my lack of interest hadn&#39;t stopped the world from spinning. There have been some pretty powerful things that have occured and the world just keeps spinning. I don&#39;t know that it is a particularly reliable gauge of the effect your dismissal of something they like may have on your relationship with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is actually a very thoughtful show. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to like it or not think it is dumb. There is a show where Seth McFarlane, the creator, interviews people who hate Family Guy. They don&#39;t know who he is. It is wonderfully funny. I can&#39;t find it on-line. Maybe it was on only in the UK.

I rarely sit and watch it with them, tho I&#39;m usually nearby and can hear the dialogue.  When I hear something I&#39;d like to comment on, I often say &quot;Do you get why that joke was funny?&quot; which gives me the opening to discuss the context of the joke, the historical aspects, and how it relate to current issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Family Guy and South Park (Simpsons, too, but I like them) we&#39;ve talked about all kinds of things that otherwise may not have come up in day to day conversation. The topics parents are told they &#39;must&#39; talk about with their kids -- sex, drug, morals -- become just part of life instead of being heavily weighted sit-down conversations (lectures) with kids.  So, altho I really can&#39;t stand Family Guy, I defend my kids&#39; right to watch it -- have to from time to time with my husband, who is even more offended by those shows than I am.  So much so that he can&#39;t see any value in them at all, but he trusts me on this one.  He just has to leave the room.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think it&#39;s perfectly okay for your kids to know you don&#39;t like a particular show, or book or whatever.  We all have different tastes and opinions.  Just because I don&#39;t like a TV show doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s forbidden to them.  I have interests and passions my kids don&#39;t share, and likely never will.  Different strokes for different folks. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, we&#39;ve asked them not to watch FG, SouthPark, or even The Simpsons when we&#39;re visiting the in-laws. It&#39;s just not worth the discomfort for others, which allows even more discussion about consideration for others, and why their grandparents feel as they do about the influences of TV on kids. They agreed that watching those shows when we visit grandparents or aunties (we&#39;ll be visiting both in CA in 3 wks) would just be more trouble than it&#39;s worth.  We just DVR what they&#39;ll miss while we&#39;re gone and they can have a Family Guy/South Park Marathon when we get home.  No big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n(Ren)<br/>\n<br/>\nSexual innuendos are only a problem if someone is uncomfortable with sex as a topic. I think it&#39;s one of the best shows for making connections to tons of cultural references and musicals. <br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nRen, you know I love ya, but I have to disagree here.  I am very comfortable with sex as a topic. Sometimes too comfortable. &lt;g&gt;  I can talk about with kids, friends, nursing Moms I just met. I&#39;ve talked about sex one-on-one and in groups, in private settings and not-so-private setting.  However, I don&#39;t find any of the sex talk on Family Guy to be funny, or anything other than offensive and ugly.  My reaction is deeply visceral, but I can move above that and manage to parlay that awful stuff into conversations about sex and relationships, history and culture, because I think it&#39;s essential that our kids be aware of the connotations of sex in our culture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree the cultural references are great, downright invaluable in exposing and explaining so much about our world.  I seldom get the musical references (because I simply can&#39;t stand musicals), but I&#39;ve noticed that whenever Will&#39;s girlfriend is over she explains, for example, that a reference to &quot;pirates in pants&quot;  comes from Pirates of Penzance.  Then again, she is Music Theory major who sings opera, so that aspect of entertainment is her forte.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, hey, if you really want your boundaries stretched on this topic, buy your kids a copy of Grand Theft Auto!  So many opportunites to stretch and grow. &lt;g&gt;  I am having conversations about things I never thought I&#39;d discuss with a 12yo boy, much less a 7yo boy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.ourhapahome.blogspot.com<br/>\n    www.ourhapahome365.blogspot.com<br/>\nwww.mysquareone.blogspot.com         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Family Guy","postDate":"1218131348","msgId":35194,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFEQ0M1QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":35193,"nextInTopic":35196,"prevInTime":35193,"nextInTime":35195,"topicId":35182,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m not so fond of Family Guy and that s okay.
