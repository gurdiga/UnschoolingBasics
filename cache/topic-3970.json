It&#39;s nice at<br/>\nleast one person can disagree without attacking me or<br/>\nfeeling attacked when I didn&#39;t mean to have that<br/>\nhappen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still going to unsubscribe, because there are<br/>\nthose who really don&#39;t want to hear another viewpoint.<br/>\n I have been told that I should not share my views<br/>\nhere, and I won&#39;t again.  I&#39;m not angry, but don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to continue to stay here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are very happy with our situation as you noticed<br/>\nand really don&#39;t feel the need to move in the<br/>\ndirection you all are telling me I should.  What I<br/>\nhear described is not only how I don&#39;t want my kids to<br/>\nbe educated, but how I don&#39;t want us to live. <br/>\nLearning is an extension of our whole life, or rather<br/>\nis so integrated sometimes  we can&#39;t define the line<br/>\nbetween living and learning.  My worldview is very<br/>\ndifferent from the people here, and I am not going to<br/>\nchange my beliefs about children and life and learning<br/>\nbased on what I read here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t mind not being seen as an unschooler.  It<br/>\nseems to be too rigid.  My kids love unit studies and<br/>\nsometimes enjoy workbooks.  I will educate my kids as<br/>\nis best for them and not worry about the labels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I am not viewed negatively, but please don&#39;t<br/>\nput my views down to naivete.  I was raised in a very<br/>\nrelaxed homeschool family, have been exposed to many<br/>\ndifferent people and cultures, researched education<br/>\nand learning for many years, as well as working at an<br/>\nalternative school.  I have a lot of experience with<br/>\nvarious types of education and have not made my<br/>\ndescisions about it lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you all.<br/>\nChrista<br/>\n--- Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;You have made a point though.
