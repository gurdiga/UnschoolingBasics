The kids in the top 10 percent are <br/>\nbored silly and the kids on the bottom fall out of the system <br/>\ncompletely. I&#39;m a bottom 10 percenter myself. I stopped going to <br/>\nclass in 8th grade because I was constantly told that I would<br/>\n&gt; be a failure if I couldn&#39;t do better than a C-minus average. I <br/>\neventually dropped out and left home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since then I have taught myself typography, programming, SGML, <br/>\nmarketing, cooking, candle making, and screenwriting (Honorable <br/>\nMention, Best of The West Film Festival, 1999, &quot;Life&quot;). I pursued <br/>\nthose endeavors because they interested me. It is certain that no <br/>\nschool would have taught me those disparate subjects; even <br/>\nprogramming wasn&#39;t available to me because of my infinite <br/>\ndeficiencies in mathematics. Interestingly, I became a programmer <br/>\nwithout any of the prerequisite math that educators demand.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In 2003 I left a programming job to buy a modest coffee shop in <br/>\nCorvallisbefore that day I had never been in a coffee shop, worked <br/>\nin food service, or owned a business.

My life was miserable because the only  <br/>\nfocus I was taught was to achieve, to get good grades. I have no self  <br/>\nesteem because I was bullied by adults my entire life to &#39;live up to  <br/>\nmy potential&#39;. I wasted over $50,000 in student loans going to  <br/>\ncollege when really all i wanted was to be left alone. I love being a  <br/>\nstay at home mom, the adults from my high school and my family  <br/>\nthought I was a dismal failure. That&#39;s not the system i want my kids  <br/>\nin...my dad and my aunt now, have always been proud of me, but I  <br/>\nnever saw that for all the failure I saw in other&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, my brother was considered the bottom percentage. He grew up  <br/>\nbeing compared, unfortunately to me. He had the guts to quit, to  <br/>\n&#39;fail&#39;, to stop trying to live up to others expectations. He&#39;s a  <br/>\nbrilliant guy. He figured out electronics by himself, he&#39;s a genius  <br/>\nwith computers, and understands them intuitively. He&#39;s got the same  <br/>\nissues I have, no self-esteem, much self-loathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the question is odd, what JOBS do these people have. Why not  <br/>\nask how happy they are? All in all, I&#39;d rather live happily in a  <br/>\ncrummy apartment and work in pizza (one of my favorite jobs, I might  <br/>\nadd, in college) than be wealthy and miserable (as premed, I worked  <br/>\nat a hospital, it sucked and NO ONE was happy). We&#39;re both happy now,  <br/>\nafter 30 years of life, because we finally had the nerve to buck the  <br/>\nsystem. He&#39;s married a homeschooler, and they plan on unschooling.
