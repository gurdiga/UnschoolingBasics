I can&#39;t say<br/>\nthe same.  I am used to being surrounded by family and of course food and<br/>\nsome presents.  Well, we had the &quot;some presents&quot; and some food, but I<br/>\nstruggled with the family aspect. My BIL was at our house with his Wii so<br/>\nall dh wanted to do was play that with his brother whom he rarely sees.  My<br/>\ngirls just wanted to play video games too.  In fact, presents didn&#39;t even<br/>\nhold their attention.  I dealt with it, which basically means I pushed my<br/>\nfeelings aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am better now, but I was being a HUGE martyr.

SOOOOOOOOO...........<br/>\n<br/>\nI took deep breaths and tried to *feel* abundance, but that feeling is<br/>\nstrange and unfamiliar to me. I don&#39;t recall ever feeling *enough*<br/>\nwithout the feeling of *but not for long*. I thought peace. I could<br/>\nfeel peace. I thought love. I could feel love. But I don&#39;t have any<br/>\nmemory of abundance. I will make one. Sooooooooooo.........<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagined what I thought abundance might feel like. Is this *right*?<br/>\nIs this what real abundance feels like? I don&#39;t know..... but I also<br/>\ndon&#39;t care. It feels way better than unabundance. In time real<br/>\nabundance will be in my *now* because I will know what it feels like,<br/>\nbut for this moment, I will create abundance for Megan and Sophia and<br/>\nBrandon.Sooooo....<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning was wonderful.
