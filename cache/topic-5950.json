Unfortunately all the library <br/>\nbooks are ANCIENT!---nothing since 1975. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I ran across this passage and thought I&#39;d share:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is up to you to make of the sport what you want. The achievements <br/>\nwill be yours. This is true of anything you study. The teacher can&#39;t <br/>\ngive it to you, like pouring milk into a pitcher that just sits there. <br/>\nYou must take it. You must look at it from several angles, think about <br/>\nit, tear it apart and put it back together, try, make mistakes, correct <br/>\nyourself, practice, ask questions, try again. The teacher can show you, <br/>\npoint out where you went wrong, suggest what you can do to improve.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Happily, there is no time limit and no grading. Stick with it and you <br/>\nsoon will become proficient. You will know that you have made <br/>\nprogress---not in comparison to anybody else, but from your own <br/>\npersonal starting place, according to your own characteristics, and <br/>\ntoward your own goals, or for your own purposes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is _Complete Fencing_ by Albert Manley.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5929,"nextTopicId":5966}}
