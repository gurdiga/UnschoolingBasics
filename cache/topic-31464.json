Or go to a park and you spend time with your son  <br/>\nwhile the others play.

I relate to you as I too am one who needs space.  It&#39;s  <br/>\neasier for me now as my kids are older but I do remember the day when  <br/>\nthe kids were little.  My husband would try to take the kids out from  <br/>\ntime to time for a day or give me a day out whichever I was needing.   <br/>\nThe problem was that I wouldn&#39;t get the time until I was so stressed  <br/>\nand miserable.  We would talk about having scheduled time off so I  <br/>\ncould plan and look forward to it but we never made that happen.   <br/>\nThere was a time when I found a young lady .... early 20&#39;s who would  <br/>\ncome once or twice a week for a couple of hours and either help me  <br/>\naround the house or take the kids out to the park or out to do  <br/>\nsomething fun.  If she took them out for a treat or a movie I would  <br/>\npay for that ... but usually she took them to do something that  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t cost.  They loved their time with her.   We couldn&#39;t pay her  <br/>\nmuch but we came up with an agreeable pay.  Even at once a week for  <br/>\nonly 2 hours I so looked forward to that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I know, Cecily, it is sooo important for you to take  <br/>\ncare of you and give yourself what you need.  Be creative ... think  <br/>\noutside the box if you have to but figure something out.  Your cup  <br/>\nneeds to be filled so that you have something to give to others -  <br/>\neven your family.  I&#39;ve talked to women so stressed out that they&#39;ve  <br/>\nmade themselves sick.  Getting sick is your body&#39;s way of saying  <br/>\nenough!  For crazy busy women I&#39;ve been known to suggest what I call  <br/>\nlove activities.  Sounds weird, I know ... but giving to yourself is  <br/>\na way of expressing self love.  Find and make time in your day to  <br/>\ngive to you even if it&#39;s only 15 minutes maybe while the kids nap.   <br/>\nIn those 15 minutes do something that you love, that&#39;s  <br/>\ndestressing ... something that will help fill your cup.  You  <br/>\nmentioned knitting.  I know 15 minutes isn&#39;t long but 15 minutes is  <br/>\nbetter than 0 minutes.  And maybe you can do a couple of 15 minutes  <br/>\nchunks of time throughout the day.  If not.. it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s a place to  <br/>\nstart.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this gives you some ideas or inspires some ideas of your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nShileen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341368225,"authorName":"The Patersons","from":"&quot;The Patersons&quot; &lt;tuipiri@...&gt;","profile":"tuipiri","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Stress and unschooling","postDate":"1207095717","msgId":31464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGIwMWM4OTQ1NyQ4ZmQ4YjlmMCRhZjhhMmRkMCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31468,"prevInTime":31463,"nextInTime":31465,"topicId":31464,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, I was looking through some things you ve written about unschooling, and I found this: I can t imagine being stressed while unschooling.
