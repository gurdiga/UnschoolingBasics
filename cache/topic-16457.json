You can <br/>\nask 100 different unschoolers and get 100 different definitions.  It <br/>\nlooks different in every family.  I personally don&#39;t think there is a <br/>\nstandard definition of unschooling, that is why you see so many <br/>\ndisagreements on lists.  LOL.  For me I would consider an eclectic <br/>\nhomeschooler someone who uses mis-matched stuff to achieve their <br/>\nlearning goals for their children.  Maybe a unit study that includes <br/>\nreading, science and history, with a math text thrown in and <br/>\nhandwriting sheets.  Or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me unschooling is part of our lives.  We live consensually and <br/>\nagree that school or any part of school is not what we want in our <br/>\nlives.

Just when I think that I have unschooling defined in my own mind","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2073902707\">Anyone care to define for me the difference between homeschooling <br/>\neclecticly and unschooling?  Just when I think that I have <br/>\nunschooling defined in my own mind and all my paradigms shifted, I <br/>\nhave read several heated discussions on other boards as to the true <br/>\ndefinition of unschooling, whether or not purposely introducing <br/>\nthings is unschooling, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI for myself (at least at this moment, ha ha) lean towards <br/>\nunschooling being not COMPLETLEY child led (ie-you do not neglect <br/>\nyour kids, you are actively engaged in their interests, discuss and <br/>\nenter their world and share interests and neat things with each other <br/>\nor something cool that the other may like, and we do a &quot;dance&quot; <br/>\ntogether).  This may or may not involve curriculum or textbooks if <br/>\nthat is what your child wants. However, I now think that it is our <br/>\nown motives and goals and &quot;agenda&quot; if any that is what separates us <br/>\nfrom eclectic homeschoolers and especially very structured <br/>\nhomeschoolers on the other end of the spectrum.  Would it be safe to <br/>\nsay that an eclectic approach or a more structured approach would say <br/>\nthat there are certain things that one must know, and that you will <br/>\nlearn them no matter what in a certain prescribed way, with the <br/>\neclectics allowing a little more &quot;fun&quot; and choice in the matter (but <br/>\nthat you will learn about XYZ), but the underlying &quot;expectation&quot; is <br/>\nthat it be learned and there is an underlying fear that it might not <br/>\nbe?  And that unschooling would be trusting that the writing and <br/>\nreading and math and whatever would come as the child does it as a <br/>\ntool to aid their interests (ie-as Joyce says its a &quot;side effect&quot; of <br/>\nexploring what they love), and the parent has no expectations of <br/>\nkeeping up with grade level or whatever, because they have an innate <br/>\ntrust in them?  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, with my 6 yr old, who has not printed any thing much <br/>\nmore than a word or two in months after a 3-4 month flurry of using <br/>\nevery scrap of paper in the house :) , an eclectic would expect <br/>\nwriting to be done in some form (chikadee magazine, workbook, lets do <br/>\na letter to Grandpa, sort of stuff) with the idea that it must be <br/>\ndone, and getting upset (inwardly at least) if it isn&#39;t, where as an <br/>\nunschooler would trust that once she finds more &quot;meaningful to her&quot; <br/>\nreasons to write that she will, in the meantime keeping the chikadee <br/>\nmags and stuff around in case their is an interest and because there <br/>\nis Trust it&#39;s no big deal if it not done for a while, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long, but this has been really picking my brain <br/>\nlately and has been in my mind for a while, I was interested in <br/>\nhearing what all you ladies thought...especially about parental <br/>\nmotives and how that affects our approach to homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16459,"nextTopicId":16464}}
