I think what you are saying makes alot of <br/>\nsense.  I will definitely start saying &quot;what is the problem&quot;.  But <br/>\n(isn&#39;t there always a but...) I was wondering whether I could <br/>\nsay &quot;let&#39;s try to solve problems by discussing rather than hitting&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;can you think of another way to get what you want without <br/>\nhitting&quot;.  In other words, my underlying message is that hitting is <br/>\nwrong when you are angry for not getting what you want.  I agree that <br/>\nhitting is okay for self-defense or rescuing someone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo your boys ever want you to punish the other when they&#39;ve been <br/>\nhurt?  Mine always demand that I do (because I have in the <br/>\npast).  &quot;You aren&#39;t even going to do anything to Mark...he hurt me <br/>\nand you never punish him!&quot;.  I don&#39;t know how to respond to that.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to outright tell them that I won&#39;t be punishing them <br/>\nanymore.  I am seeing though that when I don&#39;t punish, it is helping <br/>\nme stay out of it moreso and them realizing they are accountable for <br/>\ntheir conflicts.   By staying out of it, I mean taking a listening <br/>\nrole and hopefully being there so it doesn&#39;t escalate.  The big <br/>\nproblems occur when I&#39;m not nearby and I am worried that someday one <br/>\nof them will get seriously hurt, most likely the younger one who is <br/>\nalmost 20 pounds lighter.  My older son has sensory integration <br/>\nissues (some Asperger characteristics) and really does struggle with <br/>\nregulation.  He is generally happy, but can become explosive.  I <br/>\nread &quot;The Explosive Child&quot; a few years back, and am wondering if <br/>\nthat&#39;s the one where they want you to make them do exercises as an <br/>\nextreme if they don&#39;t comply.
