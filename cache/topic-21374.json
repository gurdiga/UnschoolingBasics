I was impressed with the things he will eat!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole food thing is quite an issue for me personally and through <br/>\nUnschooling I find we are defooding (like deschooling!).  We have <br/>\npretty much let meal times fall away.  I have noticed that I eat way <br/>\nless (a good thing for me I think) when I eat when I am hungry and <br/>\nnot when it is meal time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things my son loves to eat (Apples, carrots and <br/>\nJerkey) So I make sure I toss them around during the day.  This is <br/>\nnew and has helped quite a bit.  For me the less I say the better.  I <br/>\nused to say everytime he got frustrated &quot;do you want something to <br/>\neat?&quot;  How annoying is that??   While probably true...-he is often <br/>\ntoo absorbed in play to break for food, can&#39;t be bothered.   That is <br/>\nmy cue to just cut up an apple and set it there and for me to walk <br/>\naway (important in our dynamic).  I think he knows he is hungry but <br/>\noften can&#39;t be bothered.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we found Unschooling we were leaning in the Waldorf <br/>\ndirection.  I learned some interesting things!  (that&#39;s another <br/>\nstory!)  Not sure how to describe without rambling too much...but <br/>\nanyway a tidbit of information that helped me relax a bit about DS <br/>\nbeing thin and really not interested in food (there is so much <br/>\ncultural hype about a healthy appetite, what is &quot;normal&quot; etc etc) was <br/>\nthe concept of what is refered to in Waldorf circles as the four <br/>\ntemperaments(like personality types).

However,<br/>\nthe dog was old and she just happened to die while I<br/>\nwas taking care of her. We have to protect our 2<br/>\ngeckos from my cat. Spike (my cat) is very SMART. So,<br/>\nsmart he knows where his fake mice are, the geckos,<br/>\nand the crickets for the geckos are. And he tries to<br/>\nget them. He wants to play with them. But he would<br/>\nkill them if he could. But Im smarter than him, and<br/>\nIve put the crickets and his mice in a cupboard that<br/>\nis child proof.

Also if you<br/>\ncould maybe she should pet sit for a day, to see how<br/>\nit would be in her room? Because that is always<br/>\ndifferent than just holding a friends or seeing them<br/>\nat the pet store. Too many animals wind up in shelters<br/>\nor worse because people didnt do their homework<br/>\nbefore hand.

I dont say this<br/>\nharshly, I say it because I worked for a pet store,<br/>\nand too many times, I was asked after a customer<br/>\nbought a pet, could they return it or did they know<br/>\nanyone who wanted it, because they didnt do their<br/>\nresearch. when you find the right pet, it&#39;s great for<br/>\nall. <br/>\n<br/>\nwith our 3 cats, we have a fun time watching them<br/>\nchase the laser pointer, spike plays fetch with his<br/>\nfake mice, our little dog chases the cats and even<br/>\nthough our geckos are kinda boring, we like to watch<br/>\nthem walk up the walls of their cage. and if we had<br/>\nmore room, and a little bit more money, i&#39;m sure we&#39;d<br/>\nhave more pets. i know we are crazy. <br/>\n<br/>\ndanie<br/>\nit&#39;s just my 2 cents. i can&#39;t stand irresponsible pet<br/>\nowners, because they give the responsible pet owners a<br/>\nbad name. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nDon&#39;t get soaked.

It&#39;s my first experience with a rodent and I have to say it&#39;s pretty much what I expected it to be -- not very exciting.  (I&#39;ve only had dogs and a cat before.)  But then, my kids don&#39;t take it out and play with it although every other child who comes over is obsessed with it.  The friends from whom we got the hamster (theirs had babies), love them.  They take it in and out of the cage all day, hold them, pet them, etc.  I think if your child really loves animals and wants a pet to play with they&#39;re relatively inexpensive and little work.  The more expensive litter *is* better.  We also got two little rooms that attach to either end of the cage and essentially litter-box trained the hamster (he uses one for a bedroom and one for a bathroom), so we can do a quick clean to cut down odor without having to change the whole cage as frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve seen with friends (the ones with a hamster also have a guinea pig and had a rabbit), the bigger the pet the more interesting they tend to be.  On the other hand, the odor is stronger and you need more/bigger of everything.  Their rabbit was a lot of fun, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe vacations, we can leave the hamster with enough food for several days.  If we&#39;re gone longer than that we tend to take him with us.  Definitely think about whether you have someone to pet sit if you&#39;re going to be away longer and can&#39;t take the animal.  While I&#39;m sure plenty of people own both cats and hamsters, I&#39;m hesitant to ask someone else to take on the responsibility of protecting our pet from their cat.  A lot of the friends I would otherwise ask to hamster-sit have cats.

All of the possiblities that you listed are all very social animals just like dogs and cats. Granted, they are not as large, and can stay in cages, but they love to be held and loved. If they go without that for a while, they can become aggressive, particularly rabbits. Do you have someone, a friend or family member, that would be willing to come make sure that they are fed, watered and have a little play time while you are away? <br/>\n  My best suggestion would be the hamster. We have had several and then we moved up to rabbits and a rat. The rat is a wonderful pet, but you do have to interact with it everyday. You also should not feed them through the cage. This will also make them aggressive. <br/>\n  I hope this helps. I can understand the anxiety of picking out that first pet for your child. Trust me. It gets easier.

My name is Christy and I have a 9 year old son and 12 year old daughter. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My son is very much like yours in that matter. He has been that way almost all of his life! When he was 2 he went through at period where almost all he would eat was popsicles. A few months later almost all he would eat would be carrots! I guess they have a way of balancing themselves out lol. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, I offer him food at the times we eat, and sometimes he will eat it and other times he won&#39;t. I have learned that I can&#39;t stress over it because I don&#39;t want to make a huge deal out of food. He is thin too and really eats a lot in the evening. I think a lot of times, he is just so busy playing his games or building legos or whatever, that he doesn&#39;t think of eating. Then evening comes, and he&#39;s watching tv and realizes he is hungry. He usually will eat supper pretty well because he is hungry, but breakfast and lunch are pretty much hit and miss. We tend to sleep late, so breakfast might be partial lunch too. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t stress over it. I know the crashing thing is hard. He goes through that too, and I then I just say, &quot;Kyle, I think you are hungry. Maybe you should go in the kitchen and see if there is something you want to eat.&quot; I think he probably DIDN&#39;T realize he was hungry because he was so busy, and then he got irritable. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope this helps some. I know it isn&#39;t a solution, but sometimes it helps just to know other kids do the same thing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Christy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":253716183,"authorName":"Heather Elliott","from":"Heather Elliott &lt;justinsmom128@...&gt;","profile":"justinsmom128","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: DS won&#39;t eat","postDate":"1171244132","msgId":21394,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyMzkxOS43Nzc3LnFtQHdlYjM1MTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":21389,"nextInTopic":21395,"prevInTime":21393,"nextInTime":21395,"topicId":21374,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Julie, The doctor suggested that we put our son on Pedisure.

Well he is finally drinking them. I get the Kroger brand for about 6.99 for a six pack and they have three flavors. He really likes it. He favors the vanilla kind though. Sometimes he will drink two a day and I noticed that he is finally gaining some weight. He finally reached 40 pounds and we shouted for joy! He just turned seven. I try to get him to eat a lot of protein during the day or around supper. He needs to gain some weight. The doctor said he was okay but I think he needs some weight.

Those are easy to drink while you&#39;re doing<br/>\nother things and it would supplement his sporadic appetite until this<br/>\npasses. Get him a good multi-vitamin and try to keep trusting him.
