She was going to school by choice and came home by choice so i dont know if maybe the transition was easier for her. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Currently she has 2 or 3 different characters going on world of warcraft and spends a lot of time late at night playing. Last night she was up untill about 1:30 playing WoW. She got up about 9 and played me a couple games of chess......I have no idea where she learned to play...then I took her and a friend to a store and she decided how she wanted to spend her $5 while I got socks for her and little sister . Her friend found some headbands she likes so i got those for her. Then we went to mcdonalds and on home. She drew for a while and we had to leave to get her brother from the bus and go pick up dad. We got home and decided to order pizza for dinner and all the kids played outside a while. Right now she is back her with me watching mythbusters. i usualy go to bed around 11 and she usualy stays up a while after me. We have a few guidelines like ive asked her not to cook while mom and dad are asleep but all she has to do is wake me if she is hungry. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yesterday she made cookies from a mix , read for a bit, told me about airplanes and how they will fall with the nose straight up, watched the history channel and came and asked who hitler was, watched her favorite Paula&#39;shome cooking, blew bubbles while washing her hands, and more I cant remember right now. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We do things because she enjoys them not because she might learn something from them but its impossible to stop her from learning :)<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

Deschooling <br/>\nrefers to &quot;detoxifying&quot; from the school setting, getting the toxic <br/>\nideas, beliefs, behaviors, sorted out and gone. This applies to ALL <br/>\nschooled people who are looking at changing, not just children - <br/>\nadults most of all, since we&#39;ve had 12+ years of schooling/school <br/>\nthinking. Rule of thumb is 1 month of &#39;deschooling&#39; per year of <br/>\nschooling, which means us grown ups can take over a year to shake <br/>\nthe schoolish thinking and ideas. Obviously, it can vary <br/>\nindividually - some kids who&#39;ve only been in school for 1 year but <br/>\nhad a really toxic nasty time might need way more than a month to <br/>\ndetox while others who have been in school but not &#39;of&#39; school for <br/>\nyears might be able to drop those fetters and be free fairly quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is living as if school wasn&#39;t there. A common idea is to <br/>\nlive as if it&#39;s summer vacation. Which is helpful some but even <br/>\nsummer vacation still has school hanging over it just over the <br/>\nhorizon. So, is there a &#39;typical&#39; day in your household when you&#39;re <br/>\nall on vacation? Yeah, probably, since most folks like some sense of <br/>\nrhythm or pattern to their days. Will it look like my household? Not <br/>\nlikely, though there may be similarities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our house, typically, I&#39;m up and out to work around 7:30 am (I <br/>\nWOH fulltime, DH is at home fulltime with 9 1/2 yr old DS). My guys <br/>\nget up when they choose (this morning DS was up around 5, other days <br/>\nhe sleeps until around 9, he just sleeps and wakes as he needs, not <br/>\nby any kind of rule or &#39;bedtime&#39; regulation). Somewhere in the <br/>\nmiddle of the morning, they eat something. Mid day they eat <br/>\nsomething. Snacks happen whenever. TV, videogames, computer games <br/>\nand such, building with various sorts of materials (from knex to <br/>\nlegos to toilet paper tubes...) often happens, currently DS is into <br/>\nsketching assorted aliens and monsters (often with lots of weapons <br/>\nand armor and such), dishes and laundry get done, dinner gets <br/>\nprepared, I get home and we have dinner, evenings include TV, games <br/>\n(board, video, etc), and whatever else we might like to do - Monday <br/>\nnight, for instance, we went out after dinner to just drive around <br/>\nand look at Christmas lights and ended up relaxing with warm <br/>\nbeverages at Starbucks. Currently, too, we&#39;ve added in trips to the <br/>\nhospital because FIL is in ICU (heart, lungs, kidneys) which has <br/>\nalso added discussion about various organs and systems and medical <br/>\nthings (what&#39;s a biopsy?). And, with the additional drive time, <br/>\nwe&#39;re playing lots of Geography in the car (that game where I say a <br/>\nplace name and you have to pick a place that starts with the last <br/>\nletter of the place I said - for instance, I say Hartford, you say <br/>\nDenmark, I say Kentucky, you say Ypsilanti...) There might also be <br/>\ntime playing in the snow, yard work, canoeing, hiking, etc as the <br/>\nseason permits. June/July is berry picking and jam making (we have <br/>\nwild blackberries in the back yard). Holiday time usually means lots <br/>\nof baking. Winter often includes a fire in the fireplace of an <br/>\nevening and cocoa and a movie while summer often has campfires and <br/>\ns&#39;mores in the backyard. We&#39;ve watched meteor showers and eclipses <br/>\nand a fly over by the space shuttle and ISS. We&#39;ve made soaps (from <br/>\npre-made glycerine base, not from scratch with lye and all) and <br/>\nlittle magnet and copper wire motors and pored over maps and watched <br/>\nthe X Games and the Olympics and this Friday we&#39;re going to our <br/>\nmonthly hockey game (Hartford has a farm team of the NY Rangers - Go <br/>\nWolfpack!) <br/>\n<br/>\nLife goes on and learning happens<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215663104,"authorName":"shari bergquist","from":"&quot;shari bergquist&quot; &lt;shari.bergquist@...&gt;","profile":"stampymom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Need to understand","postDate":"1198019839","msgId":28598,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0MzQ3NzE0MDcxMjE4MTUxN3IxOTAxZjk4ZXlhMjU3OGY1MDVkZDg4ZDZkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwOTg2MC4zNDExNi5xbUB3ZWI2MDUyMC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDcwOTg2MC4zNDExNi5xbUB3ZWI2MDUyMC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28595,"nextInTopic":28602,"prevInTime":28597,"nextInTime":28599,"topicId":28595,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For us so far it has been a lot of tv and video games.  recently there has been more creative play and my middle daughter actually went and did some workbook","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1544767141\">For us so far it has been a lot of tv and video games.  recently there has<br/>\nbeen more creative play and my middle daughter actually went and did some<br/>\nworkbook pages(no one told her to do this)  We&#39;ve been deschooling for about<br/>\n3 weeks or so.
