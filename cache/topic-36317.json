(Thanks to  <br/>\nthe person who pointed that out!)<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI am pleased to announce that there will be a 2009 Northeast Unschooling  <br/>\nConference. It&#39;ll take place August 27-30, 2009 at the Sheraton Colonial Hotel  <br/>\nin Wakefield, Massschusetts, just north of Boston. Yep, we&#39;re adding another  <br/>\nday! We&#39;ll also have a brand new location with lots of space and amenities <br/>\n(Huge  health club with Olympic sized pool and tennis courts, free Internet in  <br/>\nconference attendee rooms, and lots more).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll have more details for you soon, but I wanted to make sure people got  it <br/>\ninto their calendars. The new web site will be up soon, assuming strange  <br/>\nthings don&#39;t happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn Baptista, running through that Who-What-Where-When-Why thing.  <br/>\nObviously the How is eluding her right now<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Looking for simple solutions to your real-life financial <br/>\nchallenges?
