I chuckled to myself, because this activity would <br/>\nhave not been allowed to me growing up.  I think we probably all <br/>\nheard our parents tell us to get out of or stay out of the puddles.  <br/>\nOkay, I know in the past it wasn&#39;t safe to play in a puddle in the <br/>\ncity due to sanitation issues and disease-and even today it could be <br/>\nquestionable-even on a farm in the country where animals free range <br/>\nthere is a question of disease.  But here on our little farm in the <br/>\nmiddle of the woods, my kids can play in the puddles and learn.  :)<br/>\nMy 2 yr olds dd saw her sister outside playing in the puddles and of <br/>\ncourse wanted outside to play too.  So, I put on her sweater (no <br/>\nshoes) and sent her out the door.  Off she was to go play in the <br/>\npuddles along side her sister.  They played and played -or should I <br/>\nsay, they learned and learned,  ;)  until it was just too cold to <br/>\nplay anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I sat watching this, I got to thinking about how great it is to <br/>\nlet my children learn so freely.  This kind of learning they couldn&#39;t <br/>\nget in any classroom setting.  It is so innocent, this <br/>\nplay/learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also made me think about my own raising.  How when I was growing <br/>\nup &quot;playing in puddles&quot; wouldn&#39;t have been allowed, but how now the <br/>\nsame parents-now turned grandparents, would allow their grandkids to <br/>\nplay in puddles.  Why the difference?  Well, honestly, our parents <br/>\nwere acting as they were taught to act.  It was automatic to them, <br/>\njust as it can be with us if we aren&#39;t on guard.  The difference <br/>\ncomes from age and wisdom actually.  It comes from a place where they <br/>\nare looking with hindsight and have come to see that what they once <br/>\nthought was a bad thing, really isn&#39;t.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger kids have a benefit of being born later in our lives.  <br/>\nThey get the benefit of having parents that have that hindsight <br/>\nalready and know how important it is not to stifle a child&#39;s freedom <br/>\nto learn hands on.  Even if it does mean getting soaking wet and <br/>\nmuddy playing in a puddle.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1000,"nextTopicId":1227}}
