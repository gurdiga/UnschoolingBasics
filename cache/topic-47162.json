It also shows that employer that he is interested and curious. Many employers can use a teen to do field/grunt work, so it can lead to a paying job. I work in air pollution and have studied wildlife biology and environmental science in grad school. If you have more specific questions I&#39;d be happy to try to help.<br/>\nValerie Thorp Virgin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] new and  14 yr old questions","postDate":"1312846489","msgId":47167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTI4NDY0ODkuMzA4NjQuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGoxb2kzbys3a3Q0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGoxb2kzbys3a3Q0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47166,"nextInTopic":47168,"prevInTime":47166,"nextInTime":47168,"topicId":47162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"what does he like to do?
