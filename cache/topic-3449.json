So I am curious how<br/>\nother &quot;unschoolers&quot; handle this.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell...I can tell our method. My dh feels like yours, that they should learn<br/>\nhow to save long term. I stood firmly on the ground that it should be their<br/>\nchoice, he agreed, but still wanted some kind of long term savings...so<br/>\nhere&#39;s the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids get regular money from us. I have a jar they keep any money they<br/>\nwant to save or keep safe, it has a paper in it for keeping track of<br/>\ndeposits and withdrawls. A home &quot;bank&quot; of sorts that they have complete<br/>\ncontrol over. They can spend or save whatever they want.<br/>\nThen they have a savings account at a real bank. I explained that Dad is<br/>\nreally into seeing them save for a car or college or whatever big things<br/>\nthey might want one day when they were older. <br/>\nI told them that money would not be accessible, so whatever they put in<br/>\nwould be gone for a long time.<br/>\nIt&#39;s completely and totally their choice to put nothing in that account, or<br/>\na small amount or whatever. That way, dh is happy because they have a long<br/>\nterm savings and the boys still  control their money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor has about $300 in long term savings and Jared has almost $200 last<br/>\ntime I checked. They&#39;ll usually give Dad a few bucks at a time to put in.<br/>\nThat&#39;s how we&#39;ve kept everyone happy and stayed true to unschooling ideals<br/>\naround here. Maybe that would work for you? The key is dh has to promise not<br/>\nto bug them about the amount to put in, or how they use their spending<br/>\nmoney.<br/>\nMarkus will ask the boys if they want to put some in long term when he sees<br/>\nthey have a chunk of money, but if they say &quot;no&quot; or give him a couple bucks,<br/>\nthat&#39;s fine and he drops it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!

I <br/>\nverbalize my thoughts when I do this, but they are just not getting it.<br/>\n=====<br/>\n<br/>\nAaaahhh, but see that&#39;s disingenuous. You don&#39;t really get $2.00 a week <br/>\nor you would probably do different things with it. You&#39;re getting $2 a <br/>\nweek in order to teach them a lesson about money, however subtly. As <br/>\nlong as that teaching impulse is there, Unschooling ain&#39;t gonna work. ;) <br/>\nSeriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with others who&#39;ve said that kids need to have enough <br/>\nmoney to do something with and need to have been getting it for a long <br/>\nenough time for it to mean something.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids get $10 a month (not much more than the $2 a week, granted) but <br/>\nit&#39;s taken them several months for it to be something actually to save. <br/>\nAt first they were only getting about $7 a month, and that just wasn&#39;t <br/>\nenough for them to have some money to spend and enough to save as well. <br/>\nThey&#39;re still not thinking about charity even with the $10; they&#39;re only <br/>\njust now starting to think about not spending it impulsively just to <br/>\nspend it. Now, they&#39;re actually starting to say that they will save it <br/>\nuntil the next store because they don&#39;t see anything they like or need. <br/>\nAnd, I think that&#39;s a *huge* step. I can see what a struggle that is for <br/>\nthem, and I applaud it--especially as a person who tends to let money <br/>\nburn a hole in my own pocket.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you&#39;d posted this on the AlwaysUnschooled list as well ;) not <br/>\njust to plug my own list but because I think this discussion is really <br/>\npertinent and different when applied to young kids. I think that with <br/>\nthe little ones, we tend to impose our own value systems and wishes onto <br/>\nthem without giving them the room to grow and the time necessary to <br/>\ndevelop the empathy and desire to give. Yes, I think some kids are born <br/>\nmore empathetic and with a greater sense of wanting to right the <br/>\ninjustices of the world. But many of us need to move through our own <br/>\nself-centered desires to arrive at that kind of broader philanthropic <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, part of *getting* to Unschooling is letting our own hopes and values <br/>\nbe *our* hopes and values, modeling behavior honestly for our children, <br/>\noffering the rationale behind our own actions and allowing our children <br/>\nthe leeway to form their opinions and make their own choices whether <br/>\nthey mirror are choices or not. A child who comes honestly and naturally <br/>\nto giving is a child who gives without resentment or hope for return. <br/>\nIsn&#39;t that really what we hope our children will do?<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Blue hair was  more money questions","postDate":"1097280708","msgId":3468,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDA4MjAyNDMwLjU0MjU2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUwNDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3467,"nextInTopic":3470,"prevInTime":3467,"nextInTime":3469,"topicId":3449,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Many people have had great success with Kool Aid for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-166200088\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (although if I were to suggest dying their hair blue he may have a<br/>\nthing or two to say!!).  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people have had great success with Kool Aid for dyeing kids&#39; hair<br/>\ndifferent colors.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some reason, other than adult discomfort, why they shouldn&#39;t dye<br/>\ntheir hair if they wanted to?

I verbalize my thoughts when I do this, but they are just not getting it.  Further, the boys especially, spend their money every week on junky stuff -- things that are cheap and/or break quickly.  We have negotiated that I will warn them when I think that something will break or is of poor quality, but the final choice is theirs.  As ds #1 put it, &quot;It&#39;s my money.

I stood firmly on the ground that it should be their choice, he agreed, but still wanted some kind of long term savings...so here&#39;s the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids get regular money from us. I have a jar they keep any money they want to save or keep safe, it has a paper in it for keeping track of deposits and withdrawls. A home &quot;bank&quot; of sorts that they have complete control over. They can spend or save whatever they want.<br/>\nThen they have a savings account at a real bank. I explained that Dad is really into seeing them save for a car or college or whatever big things they might want one day when they were older. <br/>\nI told them that money would not be accessible, so whatever they put in would be gone for a long time.<br/>\nIt&#39;s completely and totally their choice to put nothing in that account, or a small amount or whatever. That way, dh is happy because they have a long term savings and the boys still  control their money.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor has about $300 in long term savings and Jared has almost $200 last time I checked. They&#39;ll usually give Dad a few bucks at a time to put in. That&#39;s how we&#39;ve kept everyone happy and stayed true to unschooling ideals around here. Maybe that would work for you? The key is dh has to promise not to bug them about the amount to put in, or how they use their spending money.<br/>\nMarkus will ask the boys if they want to put some in long term when he sees they have a chunk of money, but if they say &quot;no&quot; or give him a couple bucks, that&#39;s fine and he drops it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3474,"nextTopicId":3538}}
