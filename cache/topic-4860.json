This is way more  important <br/>\nthan what you are or are not able to provide for them.  Watch tv  with them or <br/>\nplay board games, are there places in your life where you can shift  your <br/>\nfocus a bit?  Is there a neighborhood or homeschooling teen  willing to fill in <br/>\nthe gaps a bit for a little money?  Are there places you  can go where the <br/>\nchildren can keep themselves occupied but you can sit...(like  the library  or the <br/>\npark or something)?  Do you belong to Netflix or  something similar where they <br/>\njust send you movies in the mail?<br/>\n <br/>\nI know it must be hard.  We all have some sort of challenge that keeps  us <br/>\nfrom being the ultimate unschooling family.  Forget the ideal, work on  what <br/>\nyour particular family needs may be.  What is your alternative?   Put them in <br/>\nschool and deal with that?  That is exhausting too!<br/>\n <br/>\nMake the most of what you can do, figure out ways to maximize that and  enjoy <br/>\nyour children.  Be with them *in the moment*.  When things  aren&#39;t going <br/>\nwell, forgive yourself.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband is in the military and can be gone for months at a time.  I  worry <br/>\nthat the kids aren&#39;t getting enough during those times.  I try to  shift my <br/>\nfocus to *being* with them and not so much *what* they are doing.   A few <br/>\npeople on this list know my kids and can tell you that they are fine,  well, better <br/>\nthan fine I think!<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":169847153,"authorName":"blessed54321@wmconnect.com","from":"blessed54321@...","profile":"blessed543212003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] homeschooling malaise","postDate":"1107911515","msgId":4893,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxLjUxYThlYzA3LjJmM2FiZDViQHdtY29ubmVjdC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4892,"nextInTopic":4900,"prevInTime":4892,"nextInTime":4894,"topicId":4860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/8/2005 6:06:52 PM US Mountain Standard Time, ... jenni,,you do what you can...we have dont projects while im in bed ,,,i still have bouts","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1991177285\">In a message dated 2/8/2005 6:06:52 PM US Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jmm12_5_62@...\">jmm12_5_62@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s getting better now, but I&#39;m still wondering how <br/>\n&gt; other families homeschool when the primary home parent has a chronic <br/>\n&gt; illness.

They didn&#39;t get dressed for many years unless we went out<br/>\nsomewhere or they went to bed dressed.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Sure, my mother<br/>\nwould pop in from time to time and comment that they weren&#39;t dressed but the<br/>\nkids just blew it off.  It never bothered them.  We aren&#39;t very conventional<br/>\nanyway, so my mom got used to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;   And how do we unschool and not push things, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>while still covering what&#39;s required and not totally ditching <br/>\nour &quot;Individual Home Instruction Plan,&quot; which we are required to file <br/>\nin August and do a certain percentage of?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can think of that stuff as a governmental hoop to jump through and take<br/>\nit upon yourself to fill in the paper work any way you choose.

Find out how other unschoolers in your state fulfill the<br/>\nrequirements, figure out how you can meet them without putting the burden on<br/>\nyour children,  and then spend the rest of the year enjoying your children.<br/>\nPlay with them, watch TV with them, read with them, go places with them,<br/>\ntalk with them, love them. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my advice.

I kind of, in my head, keep track <br/>\n as to how well they do their &quot;jobs&quot; and then they receive a paycheck  <br/>\n(allowance).  I do not buy them their extras, like if they want a dvd, cd,  yugioh <br/>\ncards, etc.  They use their own money, which also keeps them from  begging me <br/>\nfor something when we are shopping for grocerys and necessities at  Meijers or <br/>\nother stores.  My job is to provide them with clothes, food,  haircuts, an <br/>\neducation, curriculum needs - those kinds of things.  It has  worked out very <br/>\nwell for all of us.  Part of them learning at home is for  them to be responsible <br/>\nand that we all work together as a family to acheive our  goals.  With their <br/>\nown spending cash, they learn math and how to  save.  Both of my two youngest <br/>\nchildren have great savings accounts.   They can add up how many months it <br/>\nwill take them before they can purchase  something and if they want it sooner, <br/>\nwill find outside jobs like babysitting  the neighbors children or raking the <br/>\nneighbors yards.  My children are very  much interest led and I let them run <br/>\nwith it, learning everything they can,  which, in some cases, will include <br/>\nreading, writing, science, math, history and  geography.  We keep track of <br/>\neverything by taking pictures and putting the  pictures in albums, writing about our <br/>\nexperience and also I write everything  down on my calendar, in case I need to <br/>\nrefer back.  I have kept all of my  calendars for the past 10 years.  They are <br/>\nin 4-H, Odyssey of the Mind,  Girlscouts, Boyscouts, Awanas, baseball, gym, <br/>\npiano, etc.  There is just so  many areas in which they are learning that I do <br/>\nnot worry about it too  much.  Maybe some of these ideas will help you out.<br/>\n <br/>\nHave a good day.<br/>\nCheryl in Michigan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213787919,"authorName":"jmm12_5_62","from":"&quot;jmm12_5_62&quot; &lt;jmm12_5_62@...&gt;","profile":"jmm12_5_62","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"homeschooling malaise","postDate":"1107734633","msgId":4860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGN1NmI5OStmNnRpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4862,"prevInTime":4859,"nextInTime":4861,"topicId":4860,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 2 children, ages 12 and 9 (as of spring 2005) went to public school through 4th and 1st grades, respectively.

This is our 2nd <br/>\nyear homeschooling.  They seem to want to just lie around and read <br/>\nall day, often balk at getting dressed, brushing teeth, doing a few <br/>\nsimple chores to help out (I have been slowly dealing with and <br/>\nrecovering from chronic fatigue-type symptoms, and energy level <br/>\nfluctuates).  I feel like I have to nag for anything to happen.  I <br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to figure out how to get the basic, necessary <br/>\nfood/clothes/rudimentary housework done AND make sure we have some <br/>\nsort of learning experiences.  We live in NY state, which has <br/>\nrequirements in many subject areas, not sure how to cover what&#39;s <br/>\nasked for while unschooling, also am worried that we are just <br/>\ndrifting along.  My 12-yr-old wants to go back to school for high <br/>\nschool (she thinks, anyway) and I don&#39;t want her to be behind and <br/>\nhave to cram at the last minute. Is it normal and OK for the children <br/>\nto be doing so little?  If it&#39;s better for them to be more active, <br/>\nhow can I motivate them?  And how do we unschool and not push things, <br/>\nwhile still covering what&#39;s required and not totally ditching <br/>\nour &quot;Individual Home Instruction Plan,&quot; which we are required to file <br/>\nin August and do a certain percentage of? And how do I not let this <br/>\nstuff drive me crazy?  Any suggestions are welcome.  Thank you so <br/>\nmuch.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4878,"nextTopicId":4903}}
