Mostly with smell and texture.  It can smell great to him, but he gags on it because the texture is not right.  I can be asked to eat somewhere else, if I have something he doesn&#39;t like the smell of (like oatmeal), and if I don&#39;t move, he will gag on his food - even when it is something he loves.  He eats: bagel and cream cheese, popped corn with butter and nutritional yeast, candy, ice cream and will drink milk, orange juice and sometimes water (but only out of a bottle or with a straw.  No veggies (except an occasional corn on the cob), no fruit (except an occasional fresh raspberry if they are really, really fresh).  These issues have only been around since he was about 4.  I have long since stopped buying anything from the store for just him - unless he asks for it directly - except for those things listed above.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe had stopped trying to get him interested in food other than those listed above.  Since we stopped asking if he&#39;d like to eat with us (even though we had not expected him to say yes) he has tried 3 things this week alone.  He didn&#39;t like one.  He ate all of another, but hasn&#39;t asked for it again, and has added the third to his list.  I see this as a minor miracle.  I don&#39;t expect him to change his diet over night, nor do I worry about him.  He&#39;s still growing, he has a ton of energy and his brain is still faster and better than mine and he is learning like crazy.<br/>\n <br/>\nI trust him to know when his body needs something and then jump on anything that he says he wishes.  I have been known to go to the store to buy something at the time he asks for it (I have to do this for the older one, too).  My older son eats a very balanced diet, but didn&#39;t pre-4 years old.  Go figure!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have been known to make up to 3 things for the littlest one because once he got it, it didn&#39;t seem right to him.  He finally decides he needs to wait for food or he finds something he will eat.  I used to get distressed about the cost, but don&#39;t anymore.  I used to get distressed about the hassle, but don&#39;t anymore.  I&#39;m trusting him to let me know his needs and I do my best to fulfill them.  Sometimes it takes a while to understand those needs.  I trust him to figure it out...and I try to provide what I can to get him there through providing a safe environment and a load of options he could choose from.<br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nIn Peace,<br/>\nGinger<br/>\nKai(8) and Kade(6)<br/>\n<br/>\nLOVE has impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s not our differences that divide us.
