We are so new to all of this but it was nothing <br/>\nshort of fascinating to see other unschooling families and also, to be <br/>\nlooking at everyone&#39;s name tag to find familiar names! I&#39;ve met a few <br/>\npeople who post here and am looking forward to going back tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nBen Lovejoy was SO enthralling. There were maybe 20-30 people in the <br/>\nroom. His talk made SO MUCH SENSE. It was also great to hear that, for <br/>\ntheir son, it took 18 months to deschool. I&#39;m there! And it&#39;s a scary <br/>\nfeeling, at times. I&#39;m excited for my husband to go to the Dad&#39;s talk <br/>\ntomorrow! I can&#39;t imagine a skeptic remaining after hearing Ben talk :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m beaming! And I had to share! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly<br/>\nTonya<br/>\nProud mama to<br/>\nChristian 5-30-95<br/>\nRory 6-9-99<br/>\nAlannah 6-18-03</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13719,"nextTopicId":13728}}
