Dan said that it isn&#39;t the easiest thing to build these<br/>\nkinds of worms because you really have to know your way around the<br/>\noperating systems, know where the weaknesses are and how to make the<br/>\nworm adapt - learn - as it is passed.  He frequents different<br/>\nprogramming boards since he is a programmer and he has to learn how to<br/>\nsafeguard his work computers from these type of worms.  It is well<br/>\nknown in the programming world that one way to bypass required<br/>\neducation is to build a successful worm or virus, get arrested for it<br/>\nand get it known that you did it.  Why?  Because when you have paid<br/>\nyour fine or served your time someone is going to be waiting for you<br/>\nwith a job offer.  Those that build the virus today are those that are<br/>\nbuilding virus protection tomorrow.  There have even been a few cases<br/>\nwhere companies have helped a programmer plead out and get a reduced<br/>\nsentence and part of his &quot;punishment&quot; is having a job!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100519971,"authorName":"Alyce","from":"&quot;Alyce&quot; &lt;alyce13j@...&gt;","profile":"alyce13j","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Spam","postDate":"1150219039","msgId":14511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2bXJ1dis2MDgxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjkwMWM2OGVlYSRhOGQ0ZmQyMCQwMWZlYThjMEBzcXVpZD4="},"prevInTopic":14490,"nextInTopic":14518,"prevInTime":14510,"nextInTime":14512,"topicId":14490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... an attachment called Lesbian Pics or something like that. ...
