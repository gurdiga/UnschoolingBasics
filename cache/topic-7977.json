I forgot to mention scrabble the first time, which is definitely <br/>\na favorite at our house. Sometimes it is difficult to play with young <br/>\nkids because their vocabularies are not as large as an adult&#39;s, but <br/>\nmy dd doesn&#39;t seem to care. For example, I would generally *go easy* <br/>\non a young child in a game so that we could both enjoy ourselves, but <br/>\nwith scrabble my dd really LIKES to see the &quot;advanced&quot; or otherwise <br/>\ncool moves. So I just play like I would with anyone else and neither <br/>\nof us cares about the scorecard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also like Quiddler, which has elements in common with scrabble in <br/>\nthat you make words out of a group of letters, only it is a card <br/>\nrather than board game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther fun ones include Connect 4 and Equate (like scrabble only with <br/>\nmath equations). Sometimes I play variations of Nim with my daughter <br/>\nwhich is sort of a mathy/logic game, but we can only play because she <br/>\nhasn&#39;t yet realized that you are guaranteed to win if you go first <br/>\n(and use the right strategy). So she always goes first. :) She likes <br/>\nthe Sudoku puzzles as well, but I&#39;m not really a fan of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmelie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"games; was failing at unschooling","postDate":"1133186738","msgId":7977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRtZjJyaStkZzF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7984,"prevInTime":7976,"nextInTime":7978,"topicId":7977,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We also like Set since just about any age can play it.

I bought &quot;5 <br/>\nCrowns&quot; last year, but we haven&#39;t pulled that one out yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis new game store we discovered, has a really intense strategy <br/>\ngame based on WW11, called &quot;Memoir 44&quot;.

It looked a bit <br/>\ncomplicated to me, but if you have any gamers that like fantasy or <br/>\nwar game type stuff, they might love it.<br/>\nHe also asked me to buy &quot;heroscape&quot;, which has a 3-dimensional <br/>\nplaying board and cool fantasy pieces to go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also told at that store, that many girls (and some guys) are <br/>\nreally hooked on this game called &quot;Killer Bunnies&quot;. Too <br/>\nfunny...reminds me of Monty Python&#39;s &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;.  So we&#39;ve got <br/>\nsome new ones to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrandie also recommended the Sudoku (sp?) games...we haven&#39;t really <br/>\nchecked it out yet.
