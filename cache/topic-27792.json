Mass Arrest Planned for Parents Who Refuse to<br/>\nVaccinate in Maryland<br/>\n*The parents of more than 2,000 students in Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland<br/>\nhave been ordered to appear in court this Saturday and have their children<br/>\ninjected with mandatory vaccines, or face a fine of $50 for every day that<br/>\nthey do not comply, or a possible ten days in jail.<br/>\nState&#39;s Attorney Glen Ivey (the Maryland equivalent of a District Attorney)<br/>\nis running the roundup. He was quoted as saying, &quot;We can do this the hard<br/>\nway or the easy way, but either way this needs to be done.&quot;<br/>\nLast year 50 parents were rounded up in Washington DC, now it is thousands<br/>\nin Maryland. What ever happened to, &quot;Life, liberty and the pursuit of<br/>\nhappiness.&quot; Is this America in 2007? Or Moscow in 1935?<br/>\nThis is a issue of national importance: Call State&#39;s Attorney for Prince<br/>\nGeorge&#39;s County Glen F. Ivey and tell him to read the Constitution and stop<br/>\nthese mass arrests. He is an elected official and remind him that even if<br/>\nyou can&#39;t vote in his district you can send a check to whoever runs against<br/>\nhim.<br/>\nState&#39;s Attorney, Glen F. Ivey<br/>\nCourthouse<br/>\n14735 Main Street<br/>\nUpper Marlboro, MD 20772-3050<br/>\n(301) 952-3500<br/>\nFax: (301) 952-3775<br/>\nAnd call Maryland Governor Martin O&#39;Malley and demand that these police<br/>\nstate tactics stop.<br/>\nOffice of the Governor<br/>\n100 State Circle<br/>\nAnnapolis, Maryland 21401-1925<br/>\n(410) 974-3591<br/>\n(800) 811-8336<br/>\nFAX: (410) 974-5735<br/>\nMost of the students are middle-schoolers who have not complied with a new<br/>\nstate mandate to get hepatitis-B or chicken pox *boosters*. Two of the most<br/>\nquestionable mandated shots in the American vaccine schedule.<br/>\nBeginning in the early 90s most children in the United States were given at<br/>\nbirth a hepatitis-B vaccine. This shot contained a quantity of mercury<br/>\nvastly in excess of the maximum exposure limits set for adults. Hepatitis-B<br/>\nis transmitted from a mother to a child during birth if the mother is<br/>\ninfected. After that it is transmitted via the exchange of bodily fluids or<br/>\nsharing needles for intravenous drug use. The middle-schoolers in Maryland<br/>\nhave virtual no chance of contracting hepatitis-B unless they are having<br/>\nunprotected sex or are mainlining heroin. Several years after hepatitis-B<br/>\nwas mandated the vaccine industry revealed that the shot loses most of it&#39;s<br/>\nefficacy by the time a child is seven which lead to the requirement for a<br/>\nbooster.<br/>\nThe United States is the only country in the world that requires the chicken<br/>\npox (varicella) vaccine. Other countries have assessed it and determined<br/>\nthat chicken pox is too mild of a disease and the chicken pox shot to<br/>\nineffective to justify the huge expenditure needed to mandate a shot. As<br/>\nwith the hepatitis-b, several years after the shot became mandated the<br/>\nvaccine industry revealed that it too diminishes in effectiveness over time<br/>\nand boosters are now mandate in many states. The failure to contract wild<br/>\nchicken pox as a child makes a person far more susceptible to the disease<br/>\nshingles as an adult. Shingles is generally considered a far more serious<br/>\ndisease than chicken pox. It is acknowledged by the vaccine industry that<br/>\nthe widespread use of the chicken pox vaccine will lead to an epidemic of<br/>\nshingles. Merck, the developer of the chicken pox vaccine now has a vaccine<br/>\nfor shingles as well.<br/>\nThe chicken pox shot has such marginal value, even by the very low standards<br/>\nof the American vaccine industry, that the only way the Advisory Committee<br/>\non Immunization Practices, the federal board comprised of vaccine industry<br/>\nrepresentatives that determines the mandatory schedule in the United States,<br/>\ncould only justify its use by making an *economic* argument that it would<br/>\nprevent parents from losing time from work and therefore was justified on an<br/>\neconomic, not medical basis. And now we have parents being thrown in jail so<br/>\nthat they don&#39;t miss time from work.<br/>\nAct now!
