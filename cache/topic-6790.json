I found by joining my local <br/>\nhomeschool group, I not only get notification about any &quot;field trips&quot; <br/>\netc they have planned (many are doing more traditional curriculum, <br/>\nbut sometimes there are things that interest us) but some of the <br/>\nmembers list themselves as unschoolers, and I&#39;ve, slowly, been able <br/>\nto connect with other unschoolers in my area.  Also, did you search <br/>\nfor a yahoo group for your state for homeschoolers (there&#39;s one here <br/>\nin MA, they&#39;re again mostly more curriculum oriented, but were <br/>\nINVALUABLE when I was writing my first letter of intent to homeschool <br/>\nand helped with getting me started as far as what&#39;s REQUIRED).   This <br/>\nsite is wonderful for those of us new to unschooling (my dd just <br/>\nfinished 6th grade, we&#39;re currently deschooling and healing).   <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully you can find some local unschoolers who can help you with <br/>\nhow they&#39;ve done their reporting and give you some tips.  I have a <br/>\nlist of &quot;educationese&quot; words that&#39;s helpful, we&#39;re writing a <br/>\nnarrative report once a year, but if you have to show work samples <br/>\n(?) you might have better luck trying to find others in your state <br/>\nwho homeschool, and particularily unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead as much as you can about unschooling.  It&#39;s hard to let go of <br/>\nthe old notions of &quot;school&quot; but if you feel in your gut that it&#39;s the <br/>\nway to go for your kids (I wasn&#39;t sure at first, had never HEARD of <br/>\nunschooling up until about a year ago!  but kept coming back to it), <br/>\nthen TRUST that and learn as much as you can.

Bite your tongue when<br/>\nyou feel like imposing lessons on them and offer to take them somewhere fun<br/>\nor play a game with them.  Let them help you cook and garden and tend the<br/>\nanimals, etc.  Work on making your home a place your children will be<br/>\nenthusiastic to be.  Buy fun games and neat toys and books.
