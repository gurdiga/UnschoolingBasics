My best buddy is a school-at-home-er but we have so much in common besides that and our kids have such a great time together, it&#39;s fine.  I just playfully roll my eyes at her when she complains it&#39;s &quot;like pushing a string, Melissa!&quot; sometimes (referring to homeschooling her kid).  She laughs and says, &quot;I know, I know--unschool!&quot;.  She&#39;ll admittedly never go the unschooling route as it just doesn&#39;t make sense to her but it&#39;s fine. <br/>\n<br/>\n Also, just because someone STARTS OUT doing school-at-home type homeschooling doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be converted.
