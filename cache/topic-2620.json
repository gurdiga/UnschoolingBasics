My brother used to smoke, but he&#39;d quit last I heard.  I know Will, my oldest son, has smoked socially -- at parties and such -- and may have taken it up full time.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.  My ex (his bio-Dad) was/is a smoker, as are my ex-mil and her dh.  There&#39;s a long history of love-hate relationships with smoking in my family.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy Dad&#39;s dad died of lung cancer at 55 yo -- lived 4 yrs after diagnosis, spent his last two years bedridden -- the result of smoking since his early teens.  My Dad smoked pipes for much of my childhood, one uncle smoked for a few years in his early 20&#39;s, one still smokes the nastiest cigars I&#39;ve ever smelled. ::shudder:::  So, my Dad was horrified when we all became smokers in our late teens.   In part, I think I may have started as a defiance -- I know my sister did it for defiance.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy Mom started smoking at 15,  with her parents&#39; permission, tho she did not smoke when for most of my childhood, having been bullied into quitting while pregnant with my younger sister.  The day she and my Dad split up 15 yrs later, she bought a carton of cigarettes.  She&#39;s stopped once or twice since then, but never for more than a few months.  Now, she&#39;s at a place where she recognizes it&#39;s self-medication for depression, but figures it&#39;s less expensive and more enjoyable than being on Paxil or some other drug for the rest of her life.  Both of her parents smoked -- Grandpa died at 42 from a massive heart attack (heart damage from Rheumatic Fever); Grandma at 75 from ovarian cancer.  Grandma had tb as a teen, lost a lung and was sent home to die at 15.  She began smoking after being widowed, and smoked 2 packs a day (menthol) to her death. All of the folks in her family smoked, and most of them lived long lives.  So there&#39;s some sense that maybe they (including my Mom) are somehow<br/>\n immune to smoking&#39;s effects.<br/>\n <br/>\nI quit smoking in &#39;86, tho I&#39;ve been known to have the occasional cigarette thru the years since then.  Sometimes, on a cool spring morning, I smell a neighbor&#39;s cigarette (or my Mom visits) and I can literally taste that first drag, but I don&#39;t buy a pack.  I don&#39;t because Gary is allergic to smoke, because the kids think it&#39;s gross.  I wonder if I were single and childless, if I&#39;d be a smoker.  Most times, I think, probably yes.  I actually enjoyed smoking, except for the expense.  I only quit because I was looking for work as a secretary and didn&#39;t want to &#39;be a smoker.&#39;  It was about remaking myself, I think.  Then I met Gary and I couldn&#39;t smoke, so I don&#39;t.  Gary has never smoked a cigarette -- never even tried one. Neither do his parents or most of his extended family.  A few of his cousins smoke, I think.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe inlaws would be just aghast to find out Will (my oldest) smokes.   They&#39;d never understand it as experimentation, or self-med of stress, etc.  I figure if he smokes, it&#39;s his life and health, and those are his choices to make.  If he gets hooked, he&#39;ll either quit or he won&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t want him smoking at home around Gary the younger boys, but I knew I couldn&#39;t tell him to not smoke at all, and expect compliance.  I wouldn&#39;t have bought cigarettes for him, but I didn&#39;t control how he spent his money when he lived at home.  I know he spent some on pot, some on beer.  I know we can&#39;t expect to control what our kids do outside our home, and that it&#39;s not fair to ban them from things we allow guests to do in our home.  My Mom doesn&#39;t smoke in the house --  no one smokes in our house, because of Gary&#39;s allergies and because we have small children.  <br/>\n <br/>\nUltimately, our kids are free agents who will do what they choose with their own bodies.  Telling them what they may not do just because we don&#39;t approve only invites more grief, and for a child who is feeling controlled, it may give them a reason to go to any lengths to defy a parent.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

Nobody in either side of our families smokes, so I&#39;m relieved<br/>\nthat there is no role modeling there of smoking, which I think is a big plus<br/>\nfor kids.  I also think that in an atmosphere where my kids know their<br/>\nchoices are always respected, they would never feel the need to &quot;sneak&quot;<br/>\ncigarettes or any decision so that they were *already* addicted at the time<br/>\nthey brought the subject up for discussion.  It almost seems like their<br/>\nasking &quot;permission&quot; after being addicted is a lose/lose situation.  If I say<br/>\n&quot;no&quot; then I run the risk of alienating them.  If I say &quot;yes&quot; then it may<br/>\nwell feel to them (depending on the discussion) that I&#39;m approving smoking.<br/>\nIn a situation where they were already addicted and asked my &quot;permission&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;d try to change the conversation to a different one.  I&#39;d talk about what<br/>\nI know of cigarettes, what it does to people&#39;s bodies, and how the addiction<br/>\nworks.  I&#39;d talk about ways to quit so it&#39;s not as hard and offer a few<br/>\nthings...my love for them and worry about their bodies if they continue to<br/>\nsmoke, and my help if they would like to quit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like I said, in an unschooling atmosphere, I&#39;d have a hard time for them<br/>\nfeeling the &quot;need&quot; to sneak it since there are no punishments for their<br/>\nchoices.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found so far in our young family life is that we&#39;ve already ended<br/>\nup talking about smoking.  My daughter (5.9) asked earlier this year &quot;what<br/>\nis that mom?&quot; pointing to an ashtray.  We were in a public place.  I think<br/>\nthere was someone there using it.  So that started a fairly basic discussion<br/>\non what the man was doing with that stick in his mouth, what the ashtray was<br/>\nfor.  What smoking does to your body.  That people don&#39;t always do things<br/>\nfor the &quot;smart&quot; reason.  Why it&#39;s so hard to stop.  I think this type of<br/>\ndiscussion will certainly go a lot longer a way in her life than something<br/>\nlike &quot;He&#39;s doing something yucky that you&#39;re never allowed to do&quot; or<br/>\nsomething along those lines which I&#39;ve heard other parents do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my hope and belief is that my kids will talk to me beforehand which will<br/>\nallow me to give them my strong beliefs and good information for them to<br/>\nmake what I hope will be the decision not to smoke.  If they do decide to do<br/>\nit, it&#39;ll be hard, but I will respect it while not telling them I think<br/>\nsmoking is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n&quot;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than<br/>\nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it.&quot;  ...
