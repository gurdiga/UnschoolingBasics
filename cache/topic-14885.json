When I was teaching, there was so much talk about the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way to teach children how to read.  I always wondered why teachers<br/>\nwere so resistant to the idea that maybe you have to look at each individual<br/>\nchild and teach them in their own way.  Now I know that even that is not the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way to teach reading, because in fact you are not teaching, they are<br/>\nlearning!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t teach her. I helped her learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made her experience with the written word pleasant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made sure she had access to the types of things she needed to read<br/>\n(walk throughs for games, for instance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI read to her (because she enjoyed that).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe listened to books on tape.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched movie versions of books she&#39;d read or heard. (Because it&#39;s<br/>\nfun! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI answered her questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept paper and writing instruments handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to write down her stories. (And kept quiet when she wanted<br/>\nto do it herself even if no one else could read them! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe played word games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the concept of &quot;word jail&quot; that someone came up with ages ago<br/>\nwhere words whose spelling doesn&#39;t follow the regular rules go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI pointed out the origins of words that had baffling spellings (like<br/>\nbeautiful and photograph) because there is a reason for the spellings!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, because when my son was in his preschool years, I thought I was<br/>\nteaching him how to read.  One day we were visiting Nana and Papa, who don&#39;t<br/>\nsee our children very often, and they were surprised at how well he was<br/>\nreading since the last time they saw him.  Trying to be funny, they asked<br/>\nhim, &quot;Who taught you how to read?&quot;  (They always joke about how lucky my<br/>\nkids are to have a teacher as a mom!  These comments absolutely drive me<br/>\ncrazy now! )  To everyone&#39;s surprise, my son answered, &quot;No one.  I taught<br/>\nmyself!&quot;<br/>\nIt took me awhile to not get offended by that comment.  I used to think<br/>\nabout how much work I did to set up his environment so he would learn to<br/>\nread, and how much effort I put forth to make sure he was &quot;reading&quot; things<br/>\nhe enjoyed, and that I never made reading look like a work--it was always<br/>\nsomething fun.  How could he say that I didn&#39;t teach him to read?  And then,<br/>\nas I am learning about unschooling, and the whole idea that I don&#39;t teach,<br/>\nchildren learn; I finally get it!  I should be proud of myself that I set it<br/>\nup and supported him so that he was able to learn to read on his own, not<br/>\nthat I taught him to read!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Joyce.

The <br/>\nschool has a methodical way of &quot;teaching&quot; reading. What they never consider <br/>\nis reading is not something can be taught and that people only read when <br/>\nthey are ready to read. So those children who are not ready at seven or <br/>\neight get slotted into the dumb group, get told they need special education, <br/>\nare separated out and made to feel stupid, defective, different. In every <br/>\ninteraction between teacher and kid the kid is never allowed to forget he&#39;s <br/>\nmissed the mark.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading becomes a dreaded task. Reading aloud is a lesson in humiliation. <br/>\nIt becomes easier to not read than to continue to try to read and suffer the <br/>\nshame and segregation that brings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know statistics on adult literacy but I&#39;d guess close to half the <br/>\npeople considered illiterate are immigrants who&#39;s first language is not <br/>\nEnglish. Of the rest I&#39;d bet ALL of them went to school at least through <br/>\nthe early grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a man who is considered illiterate. He graduated high school when he <br/>\nwas eighteen. He has friends who love him, a good paying job, a really <br/>\nsweet wife, a nice home and cars. He is not a member of the dregs of <br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly every sign with words also has a picture, due in part to our many <br/>\nresidents and visitors who are not English speakers/readers. Nearly all <br/>\nproducts are labeled so that we know the contents by the graphic. Much news <br/>\nand information is transmitted via TV, video, audio and telephone. While <br/>\nreading is really useful the fact that there are people living well with <br/>\nminimal reading skills is evidence it&#39;s not vital, at least not to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have a different approach to reading. They believe that all <br/>\nchildren who live in an environment where reading is a useful tool will <br/>\nlearn how to use that tool. They&#39;ll want to use it because they&#39;ll see <br/>\nit&#39;s useful. They&#39;ll have opportunity to play and experiment with it <br/>\nwithout pressure to master it. They will have help when they want it and <br/>\npeace when they don&#39;t.

If reading is a natural<br/>\nthing then how do you explain this?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed this the first time &#39;round.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea in school is that everyone needs to read at the same time.  The <br/>\nschool has a methodical way of &quot;teaching&quot; reading.  What they never consider <br/>\nis reading is not something can be taught and that people only read when <br/>\nthey are ready to read.   So those children who are not ready at seven or <br/>\neight get slotted into the dumb group, get told they need special education, <br/>\nare separated out and made to feel stupid, defective, different.   In every <br/>\ninteraction between teacher and kid the kid is never allowed to forget he&#39;s <br/>\nmissed the mark.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading becomes a dreaded task.  Reading aloud is a lesson in humiliation. <br/>\nIt becomes easier to not read than to continue to try to read and suffer the <br/>\nshame and segregation that brings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know statistics on adult literacy but I&#39;d guess close to half the <br/>\npeople considered illiterate are immigrants who&#39;s first language is not <br/>\nEnglish.   Of the rest I&#39;d bet ALL of them went to school at least through <br/>\nthe early grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a man who is considered illiterate.  He graduated high school when he <br/>\nwas eighteen.  He has friends who love him, a good paying job, a really <br/>\nsweet wife, a nice home and cars.   He is not a member of the dregs of <br/>\nsociety.<br/>\n<br/>\nNearly every sign with words also has a picture, due in part to our many <br/>\nresidents and visitors who are not English speakers/readers.   Nearly all <br/>\nproducts are labeled so that we know the contents by the graphic.  Much news <br/>\nand information is transmitted via TV, video, audio and telephone.   While <br/>\nreading is really useful the fact that there are people living well with <br/>\nminimal reading skills is evidence it&#39;s not vital, at least not to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have a different approach to reading.   They believe that all <br/>\nchildren who live in an environment where reading is a useful tool will <br/>\nlearn how to use that tool.   They&#39;ll want to use it because they&#39;ll see <br/>\nit&#39;s useful.  They&#39;ll have opportunity to play and experiment with it <br/>\nwithout pressure to master it.  They will have help when they want it and <br/>\npeace when they don&#39;t.  They will know reading might come at the age of four <br/>\nor seven or nine or nineteen but it will come and their psychology will not <br/>\nbe altered by shame and frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a new concept for most people, that life is not ruined by later <br/>\nreading.

We painted and he had some <br/>\nletter stickers so decided to put a letter sticker of the first letter of <br/>\neach of his friends names on each letter.  Some he did on his own some he <br/>\nasked about.  He also asked to how to write his friends names or asked me <br/>\nto.  He signed all the cards.  None of this was staged or set up.  I thought <br/>\nit was interesting that he noticed after writing ANNA that it was the same <br/>\nforward and backward.  I just thought this was so much more natural a way to <br/>\nlearn these things than by staging a practice session for him to practice <br/>\nwriting and insisting he try to sound out words. etc.  he loves to write <br/>\nbooks, make cards etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;From: Kelly Weyd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellmar98@...\">kellmar98@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: learning to read<br/>\n&gt;Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2006 19:15:02 -0700 (PDT)<br/>\n&gt;MIME-Version: 1.0<br/>\n&gt;X-Originating-IP: 68.142.198.120<br/>\n&gt;X-Sender: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kellmar98@...\">kellmar98@...</a><br/>\n&gt;Received: from n23.bullet.scd.yahoo.com ([66.94.237.52]) by <br/>\n&gt;bay0-mc9-f7.bay0.hotmail.com with Microsoft SMTPSVC(6.0.3790.2444); Tue, 17 <br/>\n&gt;Oct 2006 19:25:19 -0700<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [66.218.69.3] by n23.bullet.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 18 Oct <br/>\n&gt;2006 02:23:55 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [66.218.67.96] by t3.bullet.scd.yahoo.com with NNFMP; 18 Oct <br/>\n&gt;2006 02:23:55 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 41885 invoked from network); 18 Oct 2006 02:21:53 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (66.218.67.33)  by m39.grp.scd.yahoo.com with QMQP; <br/>\n&gt;18 Oct 2006 02:21:53 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from unknown (HELO web31408.mail.mud.yahoo.com) (68.142.198.120)  <br/>\n&gt;by mta7.grp.scd.yahoo.com with SMTP; 18 Oct 2006 02:21:52 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: (qmail 53656 invoked by uid 60001); 18 Oct 2006 02:15:02 -0000<br/>\n&gt;Received: from [208.104.121.149] by web31408.mail.mud.yahoo.com via HTTP; <br/>\n&gt;Tue, 17 Oct 2006 19:15:02 PDT<br/>\n&gt;X-Message-Info: LsUYwwHHNt0VsocX36cuMA3wCJQZ7uhK9+jukuWOFlI=<br/>\n&gt;Comment: DomainKeys?

If reading is a natural <br/>\nthing then how do you explain this?  ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nOne word; SCHOOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a real-life scenario that played out right before my eyes. The<br/>\nneighbor kids in Pensacola hung out at our house virtually every day.<br/>\nThe boy was about the same age as Jared. As Jared joyfully pursued his<br/>\ninterests in Pokemon, video games, art and dragons he slowly built a<br/>\nmodel of his universe, which included reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrai however, was in school, learning that he was dumb. Both of these<br/>\nboys were on a very similar developmental schedule in terms of<br/>\nreading. Jared never saw himself as flawed because he couldn&#39;t read.<br/>\nTrai believed with all his heart that he was &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;learning<br/>\ndisabled&quot; and &quot;not very good at reading&quot;. He was only 9 years old when<br/>\nhe was telling us this stuff....by NINE years of age they had<br/>\nconvinced the child he wasn&#39;t good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he grows up illiterate, it will be because enough damage had been<br/>\ndone early on, to convince this child he should give up. How many<br/>\nilliterate adults do you know that didn&#39;t go to school? If they didn&#39;t<br/>\ngo to school, did they have interested, interesting adults sharing<br/>\ntheir passions and helping them navigate the world? I highly doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany years ago, illiteracy would have been easier to understand<br/>\nbecause homes weren&#39;t filled with books and computers and many<br/>\nopportunities to read! That isn&#39;t true any longer. We live in the<br/>\ninformation age folks!! There&#39;s no lack of resources for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are probably more illiterate people in today&#39;s age than<br/>\nin years past. All that school damage makes children give up. Once<br/>\nyou&#39;re convinced you&#39;re stupid, why bother?  <br/>\n<br/>\nReading is completely natural. Every child will approach it in the<br/>\nbest way for them....with an interested, curious adult there to assist<br/>\nthem as needed, they WILL learn to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe method in which Jared learned to spell was this:<br/>\n&quot;Mom, how do you spell giraffe?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;G-I-R-A-F-F-E&quot;<br/>\n&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>\nA few minutes later;<br/>\n&quot;Mom, how do you spell English?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;E-N-G-L-I-S-H&quot;<br/>\n&quot;ok thanks&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on......<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t even ask that often anymore and it was just a few months<br/>\nago that he started writing. It will happen. For some it seems to be a<br/>\nslower process that is built in small moments...for other it seems to<br/>\n&quot;click&quot; overnight. In any case, I don&#39;t believe there will be many<br/>\nilliterate unschoolers, if any.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282271960,"authorName":"susangould1","from":"&quot;susangould1&quot; &lt;ggould1@...&gt;","profile":"susangould1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: learning to read","postDate":"1161128299","msgId":18391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVoM3BoYis2Y2h0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVoM2wydSt0dWh1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18390,"nextInTopic":18392,"prevInTime":18390,"nextInTime":18392,"topicId":14885,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not trying to argue but trying to believe that kids will eventually catch on and read.

If one isn&#39;t ready,  <br/>\nhe&#39;s just not going to be able to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime will take care of it. In the mean time, read to him, turn on the  <br/>\nsubtitles on the TV, label things around the house (and then switch  <br/>\nthe labels.) There&#39;s also Peggy Kaye&#39;s Games for Reading book that  <br/>\nhas some fun games. Find things that he enjoys. None of those will  <br/>\nmake him read, but it will be information available for when he&#39;s  <br/>\nready to put it together.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":263780269,"authorName":"wyldwoodswoman","from":"&quot;wyldwoodswoman&quot; &lt;kbe6910@...&gt;","profile":"wyldwoodswoman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"learning to read","postDate":"1151179667","msgId":14885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3azYyaitsZDZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14886,"prevInTime":14884,"nextInTime":14886,"topicId":14885,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ds(6 yo) WANTS to learn to read.
