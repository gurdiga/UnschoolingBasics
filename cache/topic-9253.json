We have been discussing unschooling versus other styles of learning at home.  We were discussing what students need to learn to go to college.  A few of the other parents were saying that they teach their children what they need to learn to go to college because certain subjects are needed.  I told them about the recent posting on this group where the mother said that she would meet with college officials and show her son&#39;s portfolio and resume, etc...  I told them that what unschoolers help me to realize is that there is always out of the box experiences and approaches to life.  Where everyone is taking Road A because that is what we are told we are supposed to do in order to arrive at Place A, unschoolers have helped me to realize that there are an infinite number of roads that can get me to Road A.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo many parents think that unschooling equals less parenting, but I believe that once parents talk to and see unschoolers in actions, it will make them realize that everything they were conditioned to believe makes a good parent is up for question.  This group has definitely busted parenting myths for me, especially in the area of TV and candy eating.  What I know that many parents don&#39;t understand is that there is so much more freedom in this way of living.  I have more time to connect with my children rather than regulate them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Speaking of bedtimes","postDate":"1137645250","msgId":9254,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxbjRzMiszaXY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9253,"nextInTopic":9274,"prevInTime":9253,"nextInTime":9255,"topicId":9253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So let s greet our children with love in the morning, our husbands with a smile and a hug and all that we meet with a friendly, warm smile and sincerely ask","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-490965539\">&quot;So let&#39;s greet our children with love in the morning, our husbands<br/>\nwith a smile and a hug and all that we meet with a friendly, warm<br/>\nsmile and sincerely ask them how they are and take a minute to truly<br/>\nlisten to<br/>\nthat person.
