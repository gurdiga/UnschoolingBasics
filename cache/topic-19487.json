They&#39;re like a chess game  <br/>\nwith new rules for each game. Games draw on mapping skills, 3D  <br/>\nvisualization, reading, math concepts, strategy, planning .... Even  <br/>\nwhen kids &quot;cheat&quot; (eg, look at walkthroughs on line) they&#39;re using  <br/>\ngood problem solving techniques.
