So I don&#39;t anymore :)  I bought these<br/>\nthingies made by Kablam (which I think is actually owned by Orange Glo) They<br/>\ngo into the back of the toilet tank and keep the toilet clean with every<br/>\nflush.  I was a bit skeptical at first because I&#39;ve tried other products<br/>\nthat claim the same.  The bleach tablets always ate away at the gaskets and<br/>\nI was forever changing valves and gaskets in the tank.  This thing feeds the<br/>\nwater right into the tank and so the chemicals (although they say they are<br/>\nsafe for a dog to continue to drink from the bowl - not that I&#39;m going to<br/>\ntest that theory and glad I don&#39;t have a dog LOL!)  don&#39;t harm the tank<br/>\nparts.  No change in the water color, no chlorine smell, just a clean<br/>\ntoilet.  Change the unit every 3 months or so and no more toilet scrubbing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13594,"nextTopicId":13480}}
