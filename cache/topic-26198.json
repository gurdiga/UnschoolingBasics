Yeah, its a fun image, but it doesn&#39;t help you (I know *you* <br/>\nweren&#39;t the one who talked to her, but I have a feeling you&#39;ve met <br/>\nother &quot;poodles&quot;). Usually when someone freaks out that impressively <br/>\nthat person is expressing a whole lot of fears and insecurities all at <br/>\nonce. If you think of you own insecurities around your kids and their <br/>\nwell-being, its possible to connect with the *feelings* even if the <br/>\nways they were expressed was.....less than generous to say the least!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the interesting things about RU is how many people report <br/>\nbecomming more sensitive and compassionate to other adults in the <br/>\nprocess of learning to have better relationships with our kids. The <br/>\nsame principles really apply to all human relationships - look for the <br/>\nunderlying needs, seek to communicate (not just talk), assume positive <br/>\nintent first, and trust that the other person is doing the best she can <br/>\nwith what she has in the moment. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more, but right <br/>\nnow.... the sunshine is calling me!!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":274176358,"authorName":"One of the Wechts","from":"&quot;One of the Wechts&quot; &lt;erw@...&gt;","profile":"usoah1841","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: worms, friends vaccines and homeschool","postDate":"1189878507","msgId":26231,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNzgwMWM3ZjdjMCRhYTlmODEzMCQ4YTQyOWIwNEBNVVNJQ1JPT00+","referencesHeader":"PGZjZ3U0ZitrYW8xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26229,"nextInTopic":26232,"prevInTime":26230,"nextInTime":26232,"topicId":26198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"SNIP ... thing in children, and come of walking barefoot and stepping where pinworms (usually where animals have gone to the bathroom).

It&#39;s hard when<br/>\nfaced with any kind of prejudice and close-mindedness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not be true for you in this situation, but I have always<br/>\nthought of people who vocalize against choices I&#39;ve made as a mirror,<br/>\nshowing me that small voice of doubt within myself. It&#39;s an<br/>\nopportunity for me to look within, and see if anything they&#39;re saying<br/>\nresonates as truth for me. I&#39;ve found that the further along I am on<br/>\nthis unschooling journey, the less I hear things like that. And if I<br/>\ndo, they really just roll off my back. I have more confidence now that<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been doing this for 7 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ego is especially adept at finding those places where I still have<br/>\ndoubts and am still hanging on to old ways of doing things (in my<br/>\nmind, if not in my actions). Invariably, *those* are the things that<br/>\nare brought up to me by someone else<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach West African drumming and lead drum circles. Just recently, a<br/>\nfriend - someone who I really enjoyed being around, enjoyed her energy<br/>\n- basically called me out for teaching West African drumming, saying I<br/>\nshould leave that for the African-American teachers. (She is<br/>\nAfrican-American, I am white.) It&#39;s yet another thing stolen from<br/>\nAfrican Americans, in other words, by white people who could afford to<br/>\ntravel to West Africa and learn from teachers there. I was shocked to<br/>\nsee this belief being expressed by her. Our conversation came at the<br/>\nsame time I was taking a class at my church, looking at racism inside<br/>\nme and inside our community, and in the history of our city. No<br/>\ncoincidence there! She was giving voice to those whisperings of doubt<br/>\nI carried in myself. I took a lot of time with coming to my own truth<br/>\nabout what she was saying, really spending a lot of time in prayer and<br/>\nmeditation, talking to other drummers, other black women, etc. What<br/>\nhas come about as a result is my further confidence in what I&#39;m doing<br/>\n- there are kids who might *never* hear West African rhythms if I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t bring them to their school or camp. I have this knowledge - I<br/>\nam supposed to share it. If someone were to confront me now, I&#39;d be<br/>\neven more secure in my choice to teach - a gift of that most difficult<br/>\nencounter with my friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - if someone is expressing doubt in my choices, if I am secure in<br/>\nthose choices it doesn&#39;t blow me about in that storm of judgement - I<br/>\ncan let them be where they are. It&#39;s when I have doubt about those<br/>\nchoices that it really shakes me up, and it&#39;s an opportunity for me to<br/>\nlook within, and find the truth for myself. It becomes less important<br/>\nwhat others think of me or my choices when I am at peace.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace to you - <br/>\n<br/>\nGassho ~<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198023026,"authorName":"caradove","from":"&quot;caradove&quot; &lt;caradove@...&gt;","profile":"caradove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: worms, friends vaccines and homeschool","postDate":"1189872833","msgId":26217,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZjaDBjMSsxMDI5a0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyNjk0NS42NzIxNy5xbUB3ZWIyODAwOS5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":26214,"nextInTopic":26221,"prevInTime":26216,"nextInTime":26218,"topicId":26198,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, that gave me a laugh!

Her 5.5yo daughter and<br/>\nthe little 4yo girl from across the street were listening to it all<br/>\nand when her daughter reached out to my 1yo in my arms her mom pulled<br/>\nher away. She was very loud, angry and rude to me and then slammed the<br/>\ndoor in my face.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was so shook up I came home and cried, I could hardly speak through<br/>\nsobbing when I called my DH at work to tell him. I have so few friends<br/>\nin the area that it is a real shock to be treated that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I am posting this here because maybe some of you can give<br/>\nme a bit of insight or comfort as to how to deal with some one<br/>\nattacking with &quot;dirty, freaky, unvaccinated homeschoolers&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now how to deal with my children being left out and several moms<br/>\ndeciding I am to blame for their kids contagious illness? My 6yo<br/>\noverheard me on the phone and said &quot;who says we are dirty mommy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26157,"nextTopicId":26216}}
