Matt<br/>\nRidley is a very witty science writer. Steve Jones, a geneticist, has two<br/>\nbooks on genes. One, called Y: The Descent of Men, David&#39;s read it, but<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember it. Natalie Angier, who is a science writer for the New York<br/>\nTimes, wrote a book called Woman: An Intimate Geography, which covers alot<br/>\nof the genetic difference between men an women. Melissa recommended Richard<br/>\nDawkins&#39; book The Selfish Gene, which isn&#39;t so much about DNA as it is about<br/>\nselection working at the genetic level instead of at the level of the<br/>\nindividual. Larry Gonick&#39;s Cartoon Guide to Genetics might be good.<br/>\nActually, looking through amazon.com, Matt Ridley has done a lot on<br/>\ngenetics, even a biography of Francis Crick. You might want to see if the<br/>\nlibrary has any of his books and see if his writing appeals to your son. I<br/>\nlove Matt Ridley&#39;s writing. I can&#39;t read Dawkins, though, so I recognize<br/>\nthat writing style is everything for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Brenda Potter Reynolds&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:brenda@...\">brenda@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 08, 2007 1:45 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] books on DNA, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi, all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 16-yr-old son is suddenly interested in DNA, genes, heredity.
