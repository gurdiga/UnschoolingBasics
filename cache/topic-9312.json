Just don&#39;t push because that will certainly take the joy out of the experience of reading.  And it reflects your lack of acceptance in who he is. Focus on the wonderful gifts and skills he has.

Way back when, I tried that with my son and that turned out to be the source of his problems rather than any help at all. REading aloud is sooo different than reading silently to oneself. Once I left him alone for awhile, and he was ready, all those reading problems and &quot;learning disabilities&quot; seemed to melt away. He&#39;s a voracious reader now, but didn&#39;t really start reading fluently until 9 or 10 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion would be to relax. Don&#39;t start on any reading programs. He&#39;s not in school so he&#39;s got time to develop and advance at his own rate. Schools push early reading to keep the kids on the school conveyor belt. They need them reading independently by fourth grade so they can start assigning textbook reading and homework. You&#39;re free from all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him time off for good behavior &lt;g&gt; and just read to him. Get him comics and manga and magazines with lots of cool pictures, play games together, and listen to books on tape. Surround him with the written word and let him pick and choose what he wants to look at. Help him read if he asks but don&#39;t ask him to read. It&#39;ll happen  when he&#39;s ready and you&#39;ll wonder why you ever worried so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary, unschooling mom to Conor (16) and Casey (11)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>\n                            ~Ren Allen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198566854,"authorName":"Laura Gallagher","from":"Laura Gallagher &lt;lauradbg@...&gt;","profile":"lauradbg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New here!

For others, it is very gradual over many years.  It isn&#39;t uncommon at all for boys especially to not read until 12 or so.  My son, now 12, taught himself to read playing video games and Yu-Gi-Oh.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: lewis52005 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lewis52005@...\">lewis52005@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Thursday, January 19, 2006 2:52 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] New here!  Have questions about reading!<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi! For the last few months, I have been feeling a pull to <br/>\n&gt; unschool <br/>\n&gt; my 3 children.  Just a little history on us.  This is our 4th year <br/>\n&gt; homeschooling.  My 2 older boys went to ps for 2 years.  They <br/>\n&gt; stuggled everyday and hated anything to do with learning.  The <br/>\n&gt; school system did nothing but test my children.  When the test <br/>\n&gt; would <br/>\n&gt; come back and show that there was nothing wrong, they (ps system) <br/>\n&gt; would tell me that they would need to test again.  After all that <br/>\n&gt; craziness, I took a deep breath and jumped into this wonderful <br/>\n&gt; world <br/>\n&gt; of homeschooling.  It has been very rough at times, but very <br/>\n&gt; rewarding.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Okay I will get to my questions.  My middle son (age 10 next <br/>\n&gt; month) <br/>\n&gt; is still having a very hard time reading.  We have tried a lot of <br/>\n&gt; things.  At this point we are just starting over, using an old <br/>\n&gt; copy <br/>\n&gt; of llatl (blue program).  He is catching on better.  Here are the <br/>\n&gt; questions.  When you unschool, how do you teach your dc to read?  <br/>\n&gt; Do <br/>\n&gt; they learn on their own or do I need to guide them?  Do you use <br/>\n&gt; any <br/>\n&gt; kind of program? Also, is it normal that he is taking so long to <br/>\n&gt; learn to read?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks so much!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
