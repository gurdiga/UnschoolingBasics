LOL  I  still do it, its <br/>\none of my favorite past times, and it drives my MIL  crazy.  She would have <br/>\nbeen the woman yelling.  One time my son *gasp*  had the audacity to pee on a <br/>\ntree outside.  We live in the middle of  nowhere and I don&#39;t see the need to come <br/>\ninside just to go to the  bathroom.  Anyway, we were at my MIL&#39;s house.  And <br/>\nJared just walked  up to the tree and pee&#39;d.  I laughed, but she threw a FIT.  <br/>\nShe yelled  and screamed at Jared, then I yelled at her LOL because she had <br/>\nno right to yell  at him for something I saw nothing wrong with.  Granted when <br/>\nwe got home I  did explain to him that that was inappropriate and you don&#39;t <br/>\npee in the middle  for your grandma&#39;s front yard.
