School was starting in days and he couldn&#39;t bear the thought of it. His &quot;well-educated&quot; parents insisted he go. The high school here is well known to be a brutal environment in many ways. I suggested that his emotional health was at stake, maybe even his life, and they could worry about his &#39;education&#39; when he got his joy in life back.  They said, no, he&#39;s got to get through this, to keep his life on track.  Of course there were other issues than school, but it was  a very big problem. Ss far as I know, he went one more year.  I have just found out he is dead at 17, unspecified cause.  His senior year, I think, was coming up.  I may be wrong...but I believe that based on my conversations with him, school and lack of being heard may have driven him to take his <br/>\nlife.  I don&#39;t know why I wanted to tell this, as I hate to spread sadness, but I wanted to tell someone how sad it made me.  And put this in any discussion of public schools.

But this was an<br/>\nolder child(7th grade)and he was made well aware of the what would<br/>\nhappen. I don&#39;t think it was a punishment so much as a lesson in<br/>\ntaking responsibility for one&#39;s actions. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if my dh makes me &quot;well aware&quot; of what can happen, then he has the<br/>\nright to force me to do something I don&#39;t want to do? Children are the<br/>\nonly members of society that are made to put up with such behavior.<br/>\nIt&#39;s wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can a person take responsibility for their own actions when<br/>\nsomeone else is forcing them to do something? That isn&#39;t personal<br/>\nresponsibility at all! How can a child feel safe in coming to a parent<br/>\nwith stress or unhappiness if the parent made it very clear there<br/>\nwould be no help in solving the problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not lay that heavy burden on my child. I want them to know I<br/>\nsupport THEIR decisions and will be there for them no matter what. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want them to be afraid to discuss issues with me due to<br/>\njudgement about the choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t try to talk my child out of going to school either. I would<br/>\nlay out all the information, help them research all ends of it and<br/>\ntrust their choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest child is looking to move out of the house this fall. He&#39;s<br/>\nnever held a job long-term (worked for his Dad a few months and<br/>\nvolunteered with a friend for a while), he doesn&#39;t have his drivers<br/>\npermit yet. I could be a negative force in his decision. I don&#39;t think<br/>\nthat will do anything but put a wedge between us. He knows we support<br/>\nhim 100% and will do everything in our power to help him figure this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s already decided to purchase a bike and not drive for now. I<br/>\nreally had the idea that he would be home for a few more years...it&#39;s<br/>\nnot easy to let go. I also know that he may change his mind, we will<br/>\nsupport that 100% too. He knows we are on his side. He knows we trust<br/>\nhis choices and won&#39;t berate him for those choices regardless of the<br/>\noutcome. I think that is vital to trust and in unschooling, trust is<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom. com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25864,"nextTopicId":25867}}
