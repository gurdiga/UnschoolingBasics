The book helps you set up a game plan for when you are<br/>\ndepressed.  Maybe it would help to write out a plan of things you can do to<br/>\nmake your life simpler if you do become depressed after the second child<br/>\narrives.  You are sure to have many creative and positive ideas now, while<br/>\nyou are still feeling better to prepare for a time you are not doing well.<br/>\nThis would include stocking up on things to make meals easier and developing<br/>\na safety net, so to speak, of family and friends that can give you some<br/>\nassistance if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Sherri-Lee Pressman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sherri--lee@...\">sherri--lee@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Saturday, June 26, 2004 4:44 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Fears?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest fear is that I don&#39;t really like to &quot;play&quot; her games all that<br/>\nmuch.
