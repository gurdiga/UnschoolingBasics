Any<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ideas?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Dear Chris and all:<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I, not only had our youngest son to contend with.but a DH as well. Both these<br/>\n&gt;&gt; men are highly creative, intellegent and active BUT super sensitive to their<br/>\n&gt;&gt; feelings, place blame on everyone but themselves, and PERFECTIONISTS. (both<br/>\n&gt;&gt; these men are highly<br/>\n&gt;&gt; musical!) gentle creatures at best!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I always felt like I was walking on eggshells for fear of saying the wrong<br/>\n&gt;&gt; things and hurting their feelings. I was raised to be independent, &quot;damn the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; torpedo attitude &quot; and go for it, quite the opposite from these family<br/>\n&gt;&gt; members. I could not understand their &quot;meekness&quot;. THey saw anger as being<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;bad&quot;, I saw it as a normal human response to an undesierable situation.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I did find a book called &quot;Perfectionism and Gifted Children&quot; by Rosemary<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Callard-Szulgit and bought it, because<br/>\n&gt;&gt; a) I am a reader mom<br/>\n&gt;&gt; b) I was getting desperate because I was the &quot;bad guy &quot; all the time! (not<br/>\n&gt;&gt; whining just stating the facts!)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I gently placed the book on my husband&#39;s  pillow one night and asked him to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; just read the &quot;checklist&quot; for perfectionistic traits. At first he refused<br/>\n&gt;&gt; because of pride(he wasn&#39;t doing anything &quot;wrong&quot;) it was just how he sees<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the<br/>\n&gt;&gt; world. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Anyway he read the short book (not diagnostic language) and confirmed that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;maybe&quot; he would ease up on himself (and the rest of us!)<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It is a very difficult line to draw between living up to our potential.&quot;doing<br/>\n&gt;&gt; your best&quot;, and knowing when to ease up on yourself&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I really think folks with perfectionistic traits NEVER think their efftorts<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are satisfactory for their own &quot;imaginary&quot; standards   that they arbitrarally<br/>\n&gt;&gt; set. They may have low self esteem and think that  the way anyone is going to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; like them is be people pleasers,while never pleasing themselves. It can be a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; very frustrating time dealing with this situation.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; S ince all of us parents come from different famiily upbriingings, we all<br/>\n&gt;&gt; have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;imprints&quot; on the way our parents interacted with us; we probably tend to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; raise our kids as we were raisedWITH IMPROVEMENTS!<br/>\n&gt;&gt; One thing that I resolved to do is not take it as a personal attack, try to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; see the situation through their eyes, be affrimative but GENTLY coach them to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ease up on themselves and not be so demanding.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I hope this is not a melodrama family -bashingepisode,,,,,Since life on earth<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is nothing but relationships and those that we live with on a daily basis<br/>\n&gt;&gt; mean<br/>\n&gt;&gt; more to us than anything, we always strive towards peaceful relations with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; those we love the most!

He says he wishes he understood mathematical<br/>\nconcepts and applications better but he makes no effort to do so. He&#39;s<br/>\nnearly quit playing his clarinet completely.  No band this year and he<br/>\nrefuses private lessons with the teacher who made him feel so happy and good<br/>\nabout playing the clarinet in the past. He compares his body and appearance<br/>\nto his tall, athletic, early-developed, gregarious best friend (who also is<br/>\ndrifting towards full-time, accelerated schooling - destined for greatness<br/>\nI&#39;m sure) and feels short, pudgy, out of shape and unattractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need help.  I need help with ideas for gently and gradually helping him to<br/>\nfeel more confident in himself.  I need ideas for ways to help him not worry<br/>\nabout what other&#39;s may think or be afraid of making mistakes.  I need ideas<br/>\nfor useful phrases/affirmations to say or teach to him, activities to try<br/>\nwith him, books to read (I&#39;m reading Valerie&#39;s The Unprocessed Child right<br/>\nnow.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\non 10/2/04 4:07 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; From: Colleen in GA &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:technomom4@...\">technomom4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: kids asking for things./ reply from Colleen in GA<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reference:<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve done a fine job of teaching him what is wrong with him and now I<br/>\n&gt; need a<br/>\n&gt; way to undo as much of that as possible and show him what a beautiful,<br/>\n&gt; bright, talented, compassionate, and interesting fellow he is.   Any<br/>\n&gt; ideas?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris<br/>\n&gt; Dear Chris and all:<br/>\n&gt; I, not only had our youngest son to contend with.but a DH as well. Both these<br/>\n&gt; men are highly creative, intellegent and active BUT super sensitive to their<br/>\n&gt; feelings, place blame on everyone but themselves, and PERFECTIONISTS. (both<br/>\n&gt; these men are highly<br/>\n&gt; musical!) gentle creatures at best!<br/>\n&gt; I always felt like I was walking on eggshells for fear of saying the wrong<br/>\n&gt; things and hurting their feelings. I was raised to be independent, &quot;damn the<br/>\n&gt; torpedo attitude &quot; and go for it, quite the opposite from these family<br/>\n&gt; members. I could not understand their &quot;meekness&quot;. THey saw anger as being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bad&quot;, I saw it as a normal human response to an undesierable situation.<br/>\n&gt; I did find a book called &quot;Perfectionism and Gifted Children&quot; by Rosemary<br/>\n&gt; Callard-Szulgit and bought it, because<br/>\n&gt; a) I am a reader mom<br/>\n&gt; b) I was getting desperate because I was the &quot;bad guy &quot; all the time! (not<br/>\n&gt; whining just stating the facts!)<br/>\n&gt; I gently placed the book on my husband&#39;s  pillow one night and asked him to<br/>\n&gt; just read the &quot;checklist&quot; for perfectionistic traits. At first he refused<br/>\n&gt; because of pride(he wasn&#39;t doing anything &quot;wrong&quot;) it was just how he sees the<br/>\n&gt; world. <br/>\n&gt; Anyway he read the short book (not diagnostic language) and confirmed that<br/>\n&gt; &quot;maybe&quot; he would ease up on himself (and the rest of us!)<br/>\n&gt; It is a very difficult line to draw between living up to our potential.&quot;doing<br/>\n&gt; your best&quot;, and knowing when to ease up on yourself&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really think folks with perfectionistic traits NEVER think their efftorts<br/>\n&gt; are satisfactory for their own &quot;imaginary&quot; standards   that they arbitrarally<br/>\n&gt; set. They may have low self esteem and think that  the way anyone is going to<br/>\n&gt; like them is be people pleasers,while never pleasing themselves. It can be a<br/>\n&gt; very frustrating time dealing with this situation.<br/>\n&gt; S ince all of us parents come from different famiily upbriingings, we all have<br/>\n&gt; &quot;imprints&quot; on the way our parents interacted with us; we probably tend to<br/>\n&gt; raise our kids as we were raisedWITH IMPROVEMENTS!<br/>\n&gt; One thing that I resolved to do is not take it as a personal attack, try to<br/>\n&gt; see the situation through their eyes, be affrimative but GENTLY coach them to<br/>\n&gt; ease up on themselves and not be so demanding.<br/>\n&gt; I hope this is not a melodrama family -bashingepisode,,,,,Since life on earth<br/>\n&gt; is nothing but relationships and those that we live with on a daily basis mean<br/>\n&gt; more to us than anything, we always strive towards peaceful relations with<br/>\n&gt; those we love the most!
