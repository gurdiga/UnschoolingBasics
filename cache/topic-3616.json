What are <br/>\nthe<br/>\noptions for taking care that our children can continue Unschooling if<br/>\nsomething were to happen to us? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really lucky that way. I have a dh that completely supports <br/>\nunschooling and has agreed the kids will never go to school unless <br/>\nthey choose it themselves. If I die, he will hire outside help <br/>\noccasionally. His schedule allows him to be home a lot, so he would <br/>\nhave a way to make money and be with the kids most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we both die, my sister in Alaska is an unschooler and her and my <br/>\nbil have agreed to raise our children should that happen. She has <br/>\nthree children, so it would be a full house to be sure! But they are <br/>\nfinancially sound and believe in gentle parenting and unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know of a better back up plan than that! I do realize we are <br/>\nextremely fortunate to have such a plan. It gives me a sense of calm <br/>\nto know my children would retain their rights and their freedom <br/>\nshould something happen to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3514,"nextTopicId":3617}}
