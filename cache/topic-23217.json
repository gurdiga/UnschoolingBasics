My feeling was he needed <br/>\nto be surrounded by his family. To feel the security that a small <br/>\nbaby has the luxury of. It worked well for him.He was with us every <br/>\nmoment for the past two years and now can comfortably go with other <br/>\nfolks for a bit without feeling insecure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not think that kids who are in  the midst of loss and change as <br/>\nhuge as a new family are really in a place to face schools stupid <br/>\nexpectation.
