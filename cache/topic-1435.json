We even still have her infant toys put<br/>\nsomewhat away in a box. She is adamant about keeping them. Then of course if<br/>\nwe have a baby visitor, as occurs often, she is so delighted to be able to<br/>\nget them out for the baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nI notice that Jayn returns to her toys after a period of time, sometimes<br/>\nafter more than a year. She will suddenly, spurred by I don&#39;t know what,<br/>\njust ask where such-and-such is. I keep her toys and tiny accessories<br/>\norganized by using two different sizes of Ziploc bags and do a lot of<br/>\ncategorizing with her. It helps her find stuff. She is also gradually mixing<br/>\nher different types of toys more and more in her games. Our house is a bit<br/>\nof a haven for other kids whose parents don&#39;t give them stuff on principle.<br/>\nHowever we don&#39;t have so much stuff that Jayn can&#39;t find it when she wants<br/>\nit. I only buy her toys she asks for, not extras.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving lots of ready made toys does not stop Jayn from wanting to be<br/>\ncreative, an argument I sometimes hear in non-unschooling circles. Jayn<br/>\nstill likes to make paper dolls and figures, and is really into creating<br/>\ndoll furniture from ordinary household objects and packaging materials. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are beginning to sew clothes for her Barbies also. I will bring the crazy<br/>\nhat she designed and we made together to the conference. If anyone would<br/>\nappreciate it, it would be you guys. I have gotten a few odd looks from<br/>\nmembers of the public when wearing it, but Jayn is so proud.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
