She is exposed to the germs that are around her 24/7 sticking her thumb in her mouth isn&#39;t going to make the germs any less there.  The human mouth is a filthy thing in its own right.  Kids are sticking things in their mouths all the time, not just their thumbs.  Most respiratory illnesses are passed through airborne bacteri and virii.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you talked to her in a nonsensical manner about why thumbsucking can cause her teeth to shift?  Some kids react well to just knowing *why* they should or shouldn&#39;t do something.  For instance handwashing after one goes potty never sunk in with my middle child until we talked about (in a very scientific manner) the kinds of germs and waste that she was exposed to when she went potty.  Also, what are the chances that she would need braces anyway?  Did you or her father need braces?  Could her thumbsucking be coincidental to what her teeth would do anyway?  I&#39;m not saying just let her suck her thumb and deal with the consequences later, but it may be a moot point if she is a candidate for braces anyway.  Another thought is that I have known quite a few kids who just naturally stopped sucking their thumbs when their front teeth started becoming loose.  It was too uncomfortable and by the time those front four teeth had finally all come out they were out of the habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust food for thought<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173456984,"authorName":"mommyquilter2000","from":"&quot;mommyquilter2000&quot; &lt;claddagh@...&gt;","profile":"mommyquilter2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Any ideas to stop thumb sucking?","postDate":"1097882679","msgId":3706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNrcG03bitqMm1xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3708,"prevInTime":3705,"nextInTime":3707,"topicId":3706,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone have any ideas to stop thumb sucking?
