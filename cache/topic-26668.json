I am a raw feeder, leaving the veterinary field<br/>\n&gt; because I could not longer look people in the eye and repeat the garbage<br/>\n&gt; that I was taught about how kibble is the only thing dogs should eat.<br/>\n&gt; Kibble is not biologically appropriate food for cats or dogs.  Whole prey is<br/>\n&gt; what they should be eating.  That&#39;s what is natural and best.   I resisted<br/>\n&gt; this knowledge at first because it was not what I was taught.  But then I<br/>\n&gt; looked at who was teaching it and it was the pet food companies!  That is<br/>\n&gt; who teaches nutrition at vet schools.

I<br/>\nwithheld vaccines because the risk wasn&#39;t acceptible to me when they were<br/>\nbabies.  They co-slept with us until they were sleeping through the night.<br/>\nIt was when I had to hand them over to the school that I became so rigid<br/>\nabout rules etc...and I&#39;ve been struggling with what I think are things that<br/>\naren&#39;t right to me.  But the light has come on now.  I can see it.  I just<br/>\nneed to parent them as I did when they were babies.  Only now I don&#39;t have<br/>\nto be ever-vigilant.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will come in time and I don&#39;t have to abdicate parenting them to do<br/>\nthis well.  They are good boys not because we&#39;ve forced them to be, but<br/>\nbecause they are good kids and despite my shortcomings I am a good parent.<br/>\nI&#39;m involved and invested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you everyone but especially Joyce and Karen for talking me through<br/>\nthis hard transition.  Karen Pryor calls it a &quot;prelearning temper tantrum.&quot;<br/>\nShe says, &quot;in humans prelearning temper tantrums often seem to take place<br/>\nwhen long held beliefs are challenged and the subject knows deep inside that<br/>\nthere is some truth to the new information.  The recognition that what has<br/>\nbeen learned is not quite true seems to lead to the furious comeback, to<br/>\nexcessive response, far beyond disagreement, discussion or querying that<br/>\nmight off hand seem more probable and appropriate.&quot;  She goes on to say,<br/>\n&quot;However, I have come to regard the prelearning temper tantrum as a strong<br/>\nindicator that real learning is actually finally about to take place.  If<br/>\nyou stand back and let it pass over, like a rainstorm, there may be rainbows<br/>\non the other side.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to get about the business of unlearning what I&#39;ve accepted as truth but<br/>\nwhat felt wrong all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\n&quot;Family isn&#39;t about whose blood you have.
