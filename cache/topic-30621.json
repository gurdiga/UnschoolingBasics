It seemed like such an <br/>\nimpossible<br/>\ndream at the time but I was able to look at the reality of what stood<br/>\nbetween us and our dream of horse ownership, then I was able to address<br/>\nthose issues and make it happen. It was the beginning of a wonderful<br/>\njourney for us~ an incredible learning/loving experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if I wrote about the purchase or our second horse last <br/>\nsummer,<br/>\nbut Leigh, my 11 yo dd, took ownership of Sugar, our first horse, and we<br/>\npurchased a second horse for Lilly (8 at the time) named Snickers.<br/>\nUnfortunately, over the next few months we came to the realization that<br/>\nSnickers just wasn&#39;t going to work out. (she bucked and spooked and spun<br/>\nand was just too much horse for Lilly once she got in shape) We ended up<br/>\nputting her up for sale last fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn January, someone came to look at her. We explained the problems we <br/>\nwere<br/>\nhaving with her. She asked us if we had found an appropriate mount for <br/>\nLilly<br/>\nyet. We told her no we hadn&#39;t. She offered us a trade.our mare for her<br/>\nolder gelding. We went to meet Skippy and try him out and even though we<br/>\nweren&#39;t positive that he would work out, we felt good about the trade<br/>\nbecause he was at least a safe horse that we felt we could work with <br/>\nand if<br/>\nnot, we knew we could sell him more easily because he didn&#39;t buck or <br/>\ntake<br/>\noff on you, he was only a bit on the quick side and a little nervous. <br/>\nAnd<br/>\nwe knew that Snickers was going to a good knowledgeable home where they<br/>\ncould handle her issues. It was almost too good to be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Skippy is working out working out really well and we love him a <br/>\nlot!<br/>\nA couple months ago we tossed around the idea of building a small barn <br/>\nand<br/>\nriding arena at home and in the end we decided to do it. (it&#39;s always <br/>\nscary<br/>\ngoing further into debt but in this case, it&#39;s a win-win situation for <br/>\nus.<br/>\nOur barn loan payment will about equal our board payments and it&#39;ll <br/>\nincrease<br/>\nthe value of our property to boot.) I finally feel like I know enough <br/>\nabout<br/>\nhorses to care for them ourselves (it&#39;s amazing what hands on experience<br/>\nwill do for you) and I feel very comfortable with handling both of our<br/>\nhorses and their quirks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wonderful and latest news is that our barn is almost finished! Our<br/>\nfencing is all up and in about a week our horses will be coming to live <br/>\nat<br/>\nhome. Because we won&#39;t be working at the boarding barn anymore (we <br/>\nshovel<br/>\nstalls and water 16+- horses 7 days a week most weeks in exchange for <br/>\npart<br/>\nof our board) we will have a lot more time to enjoy our own horses. <br/>\nWe&#39;ll<br/>\nbe able to look out our windows and see our favorite furry friends at <br/>\nany<br/>\ntime of the day or night. We&#39;ll have a lot more time to just enjoy them <br/>\nand<br/>\nhang out with them and we are really excited!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur last name begins with an S and our horses&#39; names both begin with an <br/>\nS<br/>\nand so we decided to name our farm &quot;Big S Farm.&quot; Say that three times <br/>\nfast!<br/>\nLOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a blog to show some pictures of our new barn if you want to <br/>\ncheck it<br/>\nout. www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/\">http://www.bigsfarm.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30347,"nextTopicId":30628}}
