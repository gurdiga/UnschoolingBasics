I know I have stopped myself from buying a <br/>\nparticular piece of clothing because of that inner voice in my head <br/>\nthat thinks &quot;What would someone else think of this?&quot;  I am learning <br/>\nbetter and better to be true to myself and my OWN inner feelings about <br/>\nthings.  It has helped me quite a bit in better trusting my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal is not to have these &quot;smart&quot;, &quot;well-behaved&quot; children but to <br/>\nhave an awesome relationship with my children and to have healthy, <br/>\nhappy, joyful children who are doing the things they love!!  The most <br/>\nsuccessful people are not those that are making great money and have <br/>\nall these nice things, the successful ones are those that are HAPPY <br/>\nand joyful doing the things they love to do!  The ones that are LIVING <br/>\nlife!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16513,"nextTopicId":16515}}
