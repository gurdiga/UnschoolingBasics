When I first started, I would look for &quot;obvious&quot; learning -<br/>\nsomething that looked like what they might learn in school, even if<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t arrive at that by a schooly method. After a couple years,<br/>\nI completely gave up the idea that they HAD to learn ANYTHING.<br/>\nOriginally, I believed &quot;unschooling is living your life as if there<br/>\nwere no such thing as school&quot; - and I still like that a lot!

It sounds kinda<br/>\nnegligent. LOL But it&#39;s not that way at all.

I completely trust they are learning,<br/>\nbecause we are alive and engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd wouldn&#39;t you know - they&#39;ve learned a lot! I saw something Evan<br/>\nhad written to a friend not too long ago - and it was incredibly<br/>\nwell-written, well thought-out and moving. I hadn&#39;t seen him write<br/>\nlike that before, and there it was! I never worried about making him<br/>\nsit down and write an essay because it might be required of him one<br/>\nday. (well, not for the last 6 years or so - when we first started<br/>\nunschooling, I used to worry! I wouldn&#39;t make him do it, but I&#39;d<br/>\nworry.) But there it was!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis life is magic in so many ways.

A similar experience to compare with covert grading by adults is<br/>\nnot measuring up with your peer in-crowd by the way you look or dress or<br/>\ncarry yourself.

It&#39;s built-into a kid that<br/>\nthey will want to improve themselves, whether it&#39;s thru reading,<br/>\nwriting or merely just &quot;doing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut doing what&#39;s &quot;relevant/ important to her emotionally now, at this<br/>\nvery moment&quot; is more important than learning to wirte or read. Don&#39;t<br/>\nworry about exams and college, for that will not happen, not for at<br/>\nleast another 5 -10 years, so you can afford to think and worry about<br/>\nthis in a year&#39;s time. But for now, focus on what&#39;s on her priority<br/>\nlist, what matter most, to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always say to anybody starting to unschool, &quot;Imagine you&#39;re giving<br/>\nyourself and your kid a long holiday - about a whole year long! Do not<br/>\nexpect to do any lesson during this year, for you&#39;re on holiday, and<br/>\nsince you&#39;re on holiday, you&#39;ll only learn to do &quot;all those fun<br/>\nholiday stuffs&quot; like baking, camping, visiting places, shopping etc<br/>\netc etc. And this way, giving you(the parent and facilitator), a whole<br/>\nyear to figure out how you guys are going to unschool/ homeschool<br/>\nyourself. In the mean time, treat yourself by doing fun things<br/>\ntogether by going shopping for sweets/ treats/ books/ toys. This will<br/>\nmean having to learn to save those pennies (and inevitebly, counting/<br/>\nadd/ sub/ division)<br/>\n<br/>\nTake this one year to understand and observe your child- what makes<br/>\nher tick? what sort of learner is she? Visual? Kinesthetic? What&#39;s<br/>\nturns her off? What time of the day does she learn better? My child<br/>\nlearns at 8ish - 9pm at night LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep reading- You&#39;ll learn more about the many different approaches to<br/>\nhomeschooling, unschooling, educating, about how children learn thru<br/>\nplay, how thier brain works, and stay POSITIVE. The more info you<br/>\nhave, the more confident of your doing, you&#39;ll be, for there will be<br/>\nlots of trail and error along your unschooling way, evolving to one<br/>\napproach that you and your kid&#39;ll be happy with. No family&#39;s the same-<br/>\nwhat might work for my family, might not work for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m gave my kid the a year long break to deschool, by not expecting<br/>\nhim to do anything at all, no lessons for 1 year. By doing so, I kinda<br/>\nreckoned 1 wouldn&#39;t have set myself up for dissapointment, for I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t expecting anything from him. Instead I happily &quot;homeschool&quot;<br/>\nmyself. So I did kinda set myself up a routine whereby I went about<br/>\ndoing what I want like fixing my very bad Maths- I did Maths on the<br/>\ninternet, on all those kiddie learning sites that we subscribed to for<br/>\nour son- BrainPoP and Time4Learning. In the beginning my kid was<br/>\ntotally not interested, absord into his PS2 world. Eventually, he<br/>\ndecided to peep at what I was doing, he asked what I was doing, I told<br/>\nhim I was learning to undo my fears for Maths for I was a very bad<br/>\nMath student when I was young. After that, on and off, he&#39;ll asked<br/>\nme &quot;So, how are you doing now?&quot; I replied &quot;I&#39;m not so stupid<br/>\nafterall!! It&#39;s easy!!&quot; I have to admit I was genuinely pleased to<br/>\nfind that all my fears for maths was unfounded, and that Maths wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthat scary and hard afterall!. My son&#39;s reply was &quot;No mummy, you<br/>\ncan&#39;;t possibly be stupid. You know so much stuff. How can you be<br/>\nstupid. Maybe you can tell me about what you&#39;ve learn, later on, after<br/>\nI finish my game&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so that&#39;s how we transitioned into academic learning, at month 16<br/>\ninto our unschooling journey. It entails me re-learning, in<br/>\npreparation of me facilitating my son&#39;s learning, and re- discovering<br/>\nthe joy of science, history, geography and all sorts that I loved; and<br/>\nthen relaying what I&#39;ve learn to my son. Very often, I can be heard<br/>\nexclaiming loudly of the discovery or achievement I&#39;ve made, like<br/>\nrattling off the list of the planets in the right order as &quot;Sometimes<br/>\nMy Very Earthy Mother Jumps Start Uranus N Pluto&quot; - Sun, Mercury,<br/>\nVenus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this has certainly got my son&#39;s attention, for he thought it was<br/>\nhilarious LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe very often now points out to me, if certain shows relating to my<br/>\nreading/ interest, is coming on the documentary channel. Or if he&#39;s<br/>\ncome across a book at the library that he thinks I might be<br/>\ninterested. So, he is facilitating my learning, just as much as I am<br/>\nfacilitaing his learning, sub-conciously.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the Classical Education philosophy, a three-part process of<br/>\ntraining the mind. The early years are spent in absorbing facts,<br/>\nsystematically laying the foundations for advanced study.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich explains that my son is now absorbing all those facts that<br/>\nI&#39;m &quot;chatting about&quot;, systematically laying the foundations for his<br/>\nadvanced study.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;his concern with there not being tests and such is that when they go<br/>\nto college -technical/4yr/ or otherwise - or even go to apply to jobs<br/>\nthat require you to take an entrance test - they will freak out having<br/>\nnever done(or doing very few) a test before.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently reading &quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; by David and<br/>\nMicki Colfax. Maybe you can get this book for your hubby? They<br/>\nhomeschooled thier 4 sons, out of which 3 enter Harvard and the 4th is<br/>\nmost likely to follow suit. All these boys with exception of the 1st<br/>\nson for a brief moment, never set a foot in any school at all. Not<br/>\nsure if they unschooled but it did seem to come across like they are<br/>\nunschooling. Even tho David and Micki are trained educator but they<br/>\nhave mentioned that this didn&#39;t necessary made them cleverer than any<br/>\nof us. In within my local unschooling group, I know of a lady whose<br/>\nkid never been to school at all is now doing a PHd in the uni here, we<br/>\nhave heard of lots of unschooling kids doing fantastically well in<br/>\nthier GCSE&#39;s exams, which suggest that they can handle test pretty<br/>\nwell, despite never been tested at all. Over here in UK, some uni&#39;s<br/>\nhave express interest in selecting homeschooled children simply<br/>\nbecause these children has shown genuine interest and in depth<br/>\nknowledge and dedication in their chosen fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhose to say &quot;what will happen&quot; in 5 or 10 yrs time? Perhaps by then,<br/>\ntesting and exam is of the least importance when it comes to<br/>\ngetting &quot;that job&quot;? In 10 yrs time, maybe Phds will be as common as<br/>\ndiplomas is nowadays.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, my unschooling son&#39;s life is still very much revolves around<br/>\nhis ps2, ds, psp, tv, and his computer but since 4 months ago, he&#39;s<br/>\nmanaged to include Maths, English, Geography and History (in the form<br/>\nof Time4Learning, Jumpstart Yr 3 and Cluefinder Year 5) to his<br/>\nrountine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above pretty much sums up how we unschool. So yu see, unschooling<br/>\nit&#39;s not an overnight process- it&#39;s an evolving process that invlves<br/>\nthe whole family. Unschooling is about living together harmoniously,<br/>\nwhereby the learning will come naturally for the child, when she&#39;s<br/>\nready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no deadline to meet, no data to measure against, no targets<br/>\nto achieve, other than your child&#39;s own natural milestone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne advice given to me when I first started &quot;Take it one step a time.<br/>\nBy the end of every year, review where you are, and which direction<br/>\nyou wanna go&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nI have so much to say about the things written here that I don;t know where to start.<br/>\nThis group is a place where people come to get unschooling advice not general homeschooling advice.<br/>\nUnschooling is not about getting your children to do math, history or geography.<br/>\nOf course there is nothing wrong if they want to do anything that looks schooly.<br/>\nUnschoolers do not divide learning into subjects. <br/>\nThey learn form life. Math is everywhere. Kids will learn what they need, when they need and want to.<br/>\nUnschooling is about trusting that they will learn what they need, when they need , want to and are ready to.<br/>\nUnschooling is not about preparing children for life.<br/>\nUnschoolers understand that children are already living life and this is not a rehearsal for the future.<br/>\nThere was some good advice in this post. But I think the writer&#39;s goal of &quot;education&quot; might be<br/>\ntaking her away from fully unschooling but in the direction of a more schooly goal of getting kids ready for <br/>\nhigher education.<br/>\nUnschoolers that have done nothing in their life&#39;s that resembles school in any way have gone to college and succeeded because they wanted to<br/>\n Here are some good links to understand a little more :<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n <br/>\nand this is a great read:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/screwitup\">http://sandradodd.com/screwitup</a><br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New to homeschooling and REALLY new to unschooling...","postDate":"1218475763","msgId":35337,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZFMzlBMTQ3LTRDNjMtNDYxNC1BRTA1LUNERjcyMkQ4QUE5Q0BtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc3b2oxbytrMTE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc3b2oxbytrMTE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35336,"nextInTopic":35339,"prevInTime":35336,"nextInTime":35338,"topicId":35309,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So  <br/>\nI can&#39;t help you there. But that&#39;s your role - figure it out and offer  <br/>\nit to her as yet another opportunity to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way your post is written, it sounds like you&#39;re saying she is  <br/>\nunlikely to run across something on her own so how do you set it up so  <br/>\nshe does? If she&#39;s old enough to consider college courses, then you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to make it look like an happenstance, do you? You can just  <br/>\nsay, &quot;I was wondering if you might be interested in taking a college  <br/>\ncourse.&quot; And if she is interested, you give her more information.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Strewing&quot; doesn&#39;t mean never directly offering. &quot;Strewing&quot; is just  <br/>\nONE thing unschooling parents do. It is a way of creating a rich  <br/>\nenvironment for the whole family to live happily and naturally learn  <br/>\nall kinds of stuff, but it isn&#39;t like &quot;strewing&quot; is our &quot;educational  <br/>\nmethod.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought my daughter might enjoy karate - knowing her as I do, I  <br/>\nthought it would be a really good fit for her. I didn&#39;t have to figure  <br/>\nout how to strew karate, I said, &quot;Hey, I was thinking you might like  <br/>\nto take karate. Want to go watch a class?&quot;  Even THEN, after she&#39;d  <br/>\nwatched a class, she was hesitant, but I really thought it would be  <br/>\nsomething she&#39;d love if she got started. So I talked to the instructor  <br/>\n- found out she could train for a month for free AND they&#39;d even give  <br/>\nher a free uniform. So I urged her - just try one class yourself and  <br/>\nsee how it goes. She did. Years pass. Now she&#39;s a black belt and an  <br/>\ninstructor herself, and yesterday she got her first degree. It has  <br/>\nturned into the most important thing in her life and I really doubt  <br/>\nthat would have ever happened if I hadn&#39;t used my influence to get her  <br/>\nstarted.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - keep in mind, I didn&#39;t make her go. I didn&#39;t even push very  <br/>\nhard. But I did do the legwork of getting the information and I did  <br/>\ntalk her into checking it out and I did talk her into trying out a  <br/>\nclass.

We usually talk about what we&#39;re watching while it&#39;s <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to my second thought, testing isn&#39;t really a good way <br/>\nto find out what someone knows.  It&#39;s such a schoolish thing because <br/>\none teacher in a room of 25 childen needs a way to gauge what they <br/>\nare learning.  But it&#39;s not really learning to spit out something <br/>\ncrammed in unwillingly.  When I was using a curriculum at home with <br/>\nmy kids, I was proud to see their test scores were always very high.  <br/>\nBut I noticed that the same material they were testing so high on one <br/>\nweek was barely retained a few weeks later.  I remember talking with <br/>\na friend about it because she was encountering the same thing.  We <br/>\nwere trying to figure out what that meant.  Should we go back and <br/>\nrelearn the material?  Do we just go on and hope the kids will pick <br/>\nit up again later?  I felt like my kids and I were wasting so much <br/>\ntime.  Yet they are both so smart and constantly surprise me with <br/>\nthings they know and have figured out because those things have <br/>\nrelevance in their lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t jump into unschooling from that point, but I did stop <br/>\ntesting.

In my son&#39;s instance, his deschooling <br/>\nincludes isolating himself away from his school mates/ friends and all <br/>\nafterschool clubs, we cannot walk on any routes that leads to his old <br/>\nschool and he will not wear anything that has the same feel to what he <br/>\nused to wear during his school life. General activities like reading, <br/>\nbrushing his teeth, getting dress in the morning, mealtime and bedtime <br/>\nall went thru a very dramatic changes.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; I tried different books and publishers.. each and<br/>\nevery day was a painful and tearful repeat of the day before.. and<br/>\nending with my daughter saying - I thought this was going to be<br/>\nfun?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, KEEP TRYING, until you find the right way. Don&#39;t be afraid <br/>\nto ditch anything that doesn&#39;t work. If it doesn&#39;t fit, it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfit. Do not try to &quot;get used to it&quot;. Just try another method. If it is <br/>\nthe right shoe, it will fit in naturally, with no pain!!   <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the idea of homeschooling was to do things differently <br/>\nentirely from school. It is all about facilitating the child&#39;s <br/>\nlearning, according to his/ her style. You didn&#39;t write about what you <br/>\nwere doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say, start by listening to your daughter and following her <br/>\nlead. What&#39;s making it &quot;un-fun&quot;? Listen to her for her point is very <br/>\nlegit. <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk her, what would make it fun for her? <br/>\nNo matter how small or insignificant or ridiculous, remember, it is <br/>\nall about her needs first,  education 2nd and trust me when I say, it <br/>\nwill follow naturally, because it will. It&#39;s built-into a kid that <br/>\nthey will want to improve themselves, whether it&#39;s thru reading, <br/>\nwriting or merely just &quot;doing&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut doing what&#39;s &quot;relevant/ important to her emotionally now, at this <br/>\nvery moment&quot; is more important than learning to wirte or read. Don&#39;t <br/>\nworry about exams and college, for that will not happen, not for at <br/>\nleast another 5 -10 years, so you can afford to think and worry about <br/>\nthis in a year&#39;s time. But for now, focus on what&#39;s on her priority <br/>\nlist, what matter most, to her. <br/>\n   <br/>\nI always say to anybody starting to unschool, &quot;Imagine you&#39;re giving <br/>\nyourself and your kid a long holiday - about a whole year long! Do not <br/>\nexpect to do any lesson during this year, for you&#39;re on holiday, and <br/>\nsince you&#39;re on holiday, you&#39;ll only learn to do &quot;all those fun <br/>\nholiday stuffs&quot; like baking, camping, visiting places, shopping etc <br/>\netc etc. And this way, giving you(the parent and facilitator), a whole <br/>\nyear to figure out how you guys are going to unschool/ homeschool <br/>\nyourself. In the mean time, treat yourself by doing fun things <br/>\ntogether by going shopping for sweets/ treats/ books/ toys. This will <br/>\nmean having to learn to save those pennies (and inevitebly, counting/ <br/>\nadd/ sub/ division) <br/>\n<br/>\nTake this one year to understand and observe your child- what makes <br/>\nher tick? what sort of learner is she? Visual? Kinesthetic? What&#39;s <br/>\nturns her off? What time of the day does she learn better? My child <br/>\nlearns at 8ish - 9pm at night LOL!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep reading- You&#39;ll learn more about the many different approaches to <br/>\nhomeschooling, unschooling, educating, about how children learn thru <br/>\nplay, how thier brain works, and stay POSITIVE. The more info you <br/>\nhave, the more confident of your doing, you&#39;ll be, for there will be <br/>\nlots of trail and error along your unschooling way, evolving to one <br/>\napproach that you and your kid&#39;ll be happy with. No family&#39;s the same- <br/>\nwhat might work for my family, might not work for your family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m gave my kid the a year long break to deschool, by not expecting <br/>\nhim to do anything at all, no lessons for 1 year. By doing so, I kinda <br/>\nreckoned 1 wouldn&#39;t have set myself up for dissapointment, for I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t expecting anything from him. Instead I happily &quot;homeschool&quot; <br/>\nmyself. So I did kinda set myself up a routine whereby I went about <br/>\ndoing what I want like fixing my very bad Maths- I did Maths on the <br/>\ninternet, on all those kiddie learning sites that we subscribed to for <br/>\nour son- BrainPoP and Time4Learning. In the beginning my kid was <br/>\ntotally not interested, absord into his PS2 world. Eventually, he <br/>\ndecided to peep at what I was doing, he asked what I was doing, I told <br/>\nhim I was learning to undo my fears for Maths for I was a very bad <br/>\nMath student when I was young. After that, on and off, he&#39;ll asked <br/>\nme &quot;So, how are you doing now?&quot; I replied &quot;I&#39;m not so stupid <br/>\nafterall!! It&#39;s easy!!&quot; I have to admit I was genuinely pleased to <br/>\nfind that all my fears for maths was unfounded, and that Maths wasn&#39;t <br/>\nthat scary and hard afterall!. My son&#39;s reply was &quot;No mummy, you <br/>\ncan&#39;;t possibly be stupid. You know so much stuff. How can you be <br/>\nstupid. Maybe you can tell me about what you&#39;ve learn, later on, after <br/>\nI finish my game&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so that&#39;s how we transitioned into academic learning, at month 16 <br/>\ninto our unschooling journey. It entails me re-learning, in <br/>\npreparation of me facilitating my son&#39;s learning, and re- discovering <br/>\nthe joy of science, history, geography and all sorts that I loved; and <br/>\nthen relaying what I&#39;ve learn to my son. Very often, I can be heard <br/>\nexclaiming loudly of the discovery or achievement I&#39;ve made, like <br/>\nrattling off the list of the planets in the right order as &quot;Sometimes <br/>\nMy Very Earthy Mother Jumps Start Uranus N Pluto&quot; - Sun, Mercury, <br/>\nVenus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this has certainly got my son&#39;s attention, for he thought it was <br/>\nhilarious LOL!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe very often now points out to me, if certain shows relating to my <br/>\nreading/ interest, is coming on the documentary channel. Or if he&#39;s <br/>\ncome across a book at the library that he thinks I might be <br/>\ninterested. So, he is facilitating my learning, just as much as I am <br/>\nfacilitaing his learning, sub-conciously.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like the Classical Education philosophy, a three-part process of <br/>\ntraining the mind.  The early years are spent in absorbing facts, <br/>\nsystematically laying the foundations for advanced study. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich explains that my son is now absorbing all those facts that <br/>\nI&#39;m &quot;chatting about&quot;, systematically laying the foundations for his <br/>\nadvanced study.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;his concern with there not being tests and such is that when they go <br/>\nto college -technical/4yr/ or otherwise - or even go to apply to jobs <br/>\nthat require you to take an entrance test - they will freak out having <br/>\nnever done(or doing very few) a test before.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently reading &quot;Homeschooling for Excellence&quot; by David and <br/>\nMicki Colfax. Maybe you can get this book for your hubby? They <br/>\nhomeschooled thier 4 sons, out of which 3 enter Harvard and the 4th is <br/>\nmost likely to follow suit. All these boys with exception of the 1st <br/>\nson for a brief moment, never set a foot in any school at all. Not <br/>\nsure if they unschooled but it did seem to come across like they are <br/>\nunschooling. Even tho David and Micki are trained educator but they <br/>\nhave mentioned that this didn&#39;t necessary made them cleverer than any <br/>\nof us. In within my local unschooling group, I know of a lady whose <br/>\nkid never been to school at all is now doing a PHd in the uni here, we <br/>\nhave heard of lots of unschooling kids doing fantastically well in <br/>\nthier GCSE&#39;s exams, which suggest that they can handle test pretty <br/>\nwell, despite never been tested at all. Over here in UK, some uni&#39;s <br/>\nhave express interest in selecting homeschooled children simply <br/>\nbecause these children has shown genuine interest and  in depth <br/>\nknowledge and dedication in their chosen fields.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhose to say &quot;what will happen&quot; in 5 or 10 yrs time? Perhaps by then, <br/>\ntesting and exam is of the least importance when it comes to <br/>\ngetting &quot;that job&quot;? In 10 yrs time, maybe Phds will be as common as <br/>\ndiplomas is nowadays. <br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays, my unschooling son&#39;s life is still very much revolves around <br/>\nhis ps2, ds, psp, tv, and his computer but since 4 months ago, he&#39;s <br/>\nmanaged to include Maths, English, Geography and History (in the form <br/>\nof Time4Learning, Jumpstart Yr 3 and Cluefinder Year 5) to his <br/>\nrountine. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe above pretty much sums up how we unschool. So yu see, unschooling <br/>\nit&#39;s not an overnight process- it&#39;s an evolving process that invlves <br/>\nthe whole family. Unschooling is about living together harmoniously, <br/>\nwhereby the learning will come naturally for the child, when she&#39;s <br/>\nready for it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no deadline to meet, no data to measure against, no targets <br/>\nto achieve, other than your child&#39;s own natural milestone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne advice given to me when I first started &quot;Take it one step a time. <br/>\nBy the end of every year, review where you are, and which direction <br/>\nyou wanna go&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to homeschooling and REALLY new to unschooling...","postDate":"1218394726","msgId":35320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEQUZDMjU5LTU0REMtNDgyRi05OUM0LTNDNjg2QUNGMzMxMkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1MDNCNDk3LTkyREYtNEIyNS05NTIwLTIxMUFEMDEwNDIxOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGc3bGVuNStuZG9yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTUwM0I0OTctOTJERi00QjI1LTk1MjAtMjExQUQwMTA0MjE5QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":35313,"nextInTopic":35323,"prevInTime":35319,"nextInTime":35321,"topicId":35309,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Did you find this was even a <br/>\nproblem or did you do anything to &quot;prepare&quot; them for the inevitable <br/>\ntests they would face?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo see more about me and my family here are my blogs:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy homeschool blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://iveseenthevillage.blogspot.com\">http://iveseenthevillage.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nmy craft blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mommasgoodies.blogspot.com\">http://mommasgoodies.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nmy photos:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mommasgoodies/\">http://flickr.com/photos/mommasgoodies/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPlease know my blog is very SCHOOLY (as someone else called it) as I <br/>\nhave just made the switch to unschooling.. but it will be less <br/>\nschooly in the future :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCourtney P.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35464,"nextTopicId":35526}}
