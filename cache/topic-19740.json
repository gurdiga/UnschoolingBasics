We are in the process of changing Mariah&#39;s diet too, to see what effects it has on behavior and symptoms.  But in my daughter&#39;s case she is in the process of being diagnosed with Bipolar/Asperger&#39;s/SPD/OCD/Dygraphia and Anxiety Disorder.  So it&#39;s real important for us to see if diet is a factor in any of the above.  She was previously diagnosed with ADHD/ODD but that diagnoses just does not fit.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nmichelle c &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:moretime2dream@...\">moretime2dream@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I know what you mean...I have 2 sons previously dx&#39;d with Aspergers (1 also w/SID, ADHD/ODD).
