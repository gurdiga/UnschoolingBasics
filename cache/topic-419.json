I ve often felt that there","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1223359739\">Hi there -<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an unschooling mother who has just begun putting together a <br/>\nmagazine in the tradition of Growing Without Schooling.  I&#39;ve often <br/>\nfelt that there has been something missing in the <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling community for the past few years, and I <br/>\nwanted to do my part to put things right.  This is a project I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen considering for some time now and have just embarked on with a <br/>\npassion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe magazine, Live Free: Learn Free, is a forum for unschoolers and <br/>\nrelaxed homeschoolers in which to share ideas, stories, and <br/>\nexperiences in a safe environment.  All the material (save for the <br/>\nintroduction to each issue) will be written by those who home <br/>\neducate - both parents (or other relatives) and children.  It will <br/>\nbe an inclusive magazine, not only for and by experienced <br/>\nunschoolers, but also for and by those just starting down the path.  <br/>\nIt will embrace those who are radical in their unschooling methods <br/>\nand those who are less so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe magazine will be small in the beginning - put together with <br/>\nlittle money and modestly printed.  I think that home educating <br/>\nfamilies will be more interested in the content than in the look of <br/>\nthe magazine.  My hope is that this notice finds a life of its own <br/>\nby being forwarded by interested homeschoolers from list to list.  <br/>\nThis seems like the way to reach the most people and to enable the <br/>\nmagazine to become a wonderful resource.  Really, the more people <br/>\nwho write for it, the more helpful it will become.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, in my search for unschooling lists, I found you.  I <br/>\nbelieve that a magazine written by real homeschoolers at different <br/>\npoints in their journeys could be a very valuable resource for those <br/>\njust starting out.  I was not a member of this group until today, <br/>\nand I don&#39;t want to be seen as a spammer.  My motivation is to <br/>\ncreate something useful for the unschooling community, but I can&#39;t <br/>\ndo it alone.  I don&#39;t have the contacts on my own.  Not even close, <br/>\nreally.  I&#39;m a lurker, generally, posting only very rarely.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen a member of the Uschooling-List for several years now and of <br/>\nthe RUL for about a year or so.  I also belong to several smaller <br/>\nunschooling lists.  I prefer, usually, to read other&#39;s posts and <br/>\nglean from them useful information that meets my needs at the time.  <br/>\nAnd, I guess that&#39;s one of the reasons behind my creating of Live <br/>\nFree: Learn Free: it&#39;s a magazine that allows readers to get a <br/>\nglimpse of how others live and learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would be willing to post this notice, I&#39;d be very grateful.  <br/>\nIf you don&#39;t feel it meets the needs of your list members, just let <br/>\nme know.  Also, if you have any questions or would like anything <br/>\nclarified, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nShana Hickman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLIVE FREE: LEARN FREE<br/>\n<br/>\nLIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is a new, soon-to-be-launched magazine.  In <br/>\nthe tradition of John Holt&#39;s GROWING WITHOUT SCHOOLING (for <br/>\ninformation on this amazing magazine, please visit Fun Books (a site <br/>\nowned by a homeschooling family with whom LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is <br/>\nnot affiliated) at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fun-books.com/gws.htm)\">http://www.fun-books.com/gws.htm)</a>, LIVE FREE: <br/>\nLEARN FREE strives to bring home educating families together by <br/>\npublishing articles, stories, and letters written by <br/>\nhome/unschooling parents and children.  All content (except the <br/>\nintroduction to each issue) will be written by readers and will <br/>\nfocus on one or more themes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLIVE FREE: LEARN FREE is looking for parents and children involved <br/>\nin home education, particularly unschooling or relaxed/eclectic <br/>\nhomeschooling, to contribute to the first issue.  We&#39;ve decided to <br/>\njust dive right in and start with the &quot;Big S&quot;: Socialization.  It&#39;s <br/>\nusually the first concern relatives or well-meaning strangers voice, <br/>\nand it is often a deciding factor in a family&#39;s decision to educate <br/>\ntheir children at home.  It&#39;s a scary question, but does it have to <br/>\nbe?  Send us stories of your own experiences, your thoughts on the <br/>\nimportance or unimportance of socialization, what socialization has <br/>\ncome to mean for you and your family, etc.  Anything goes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, we&#39;d like to receive, on an ongoing basis, articles or <br/>\nletters about what works (or doesn&#39;t work) for you as home <br/>\neducators: lifestyle choices (such as bedtimes, chores, etc.), <br/>\ncurriculum/non-curriculum choices, resources, etc., as well as <br/>\nglimpses into the days and ways of an unschooling family.  This will <br/>\nbe a recurring section of the magazine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if there are changes occurring in your state&#39;s <br/>\nhomeschooling laws, we want to hear about it.  You can use LIVE <br/>\nFREE: LEARN FREE as another forum to reach as many home educators in <br/>\nyour state as possible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no monetary payment for contributors; however, each <br/>\ncontributing writer will receive a free copy of the magazine.  <br/>\nAdditionally, authors who request it will receive a frame-able <br/>\ncertificate thanking them for their contribution to LIVE FREE: LEARN <br/>\nFREE (a great incentive for kids of all ages).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send all articles, stories, letters, etc. in the body of an <br/>\nemail or in an attached Word document.  Hard copies of contributions <br/>\nmay also be sent to our physical address for those without Internet <br/>\naccess.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough we strive to print as much as possible, unfortunately not <br/>\nevery contribution will make it into LIVE FREE: LEARN FREE.  Whether <br/>\nwe use your article or not, you will receive a response from the <br/>\neditors.  We hope to have enough material to print a stellar first <br/>\nissue within about a month; however, we have not set a firm <br/>\ndeadline, as we don&#39;t know the amount of interest this notice will <br/>\ngenerate.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also looking for advertisers.
