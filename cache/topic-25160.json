There are things I don&#39;t tend to discuss with my <br/>\ndd(6) because she&#39;s not terribly verbal, but I do try to involve her <br/>\nin family processes as much as possible. In a general sense, she <br/>\nknows how much money we have to spend on non-essentials at any given <br/>\ntime bc its something we refer to regularly. The economics of the <br/>\nhousehold are something we involve her in to the extent that she&#39;s <br/>\ncapable of understanding and/or interested in. It wouldn&#39;t occur to <br/>\nme to go away from her to converse about finances, although she <br/>\nmight get tired of my discussion with George about the details and <br/>\nwander off to do her own thing and ask for a synopis later. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson is older, but a new addition to the family, so we&#39;ve been <br/>\nsort of fumbling along trying to figure out how to include him in <br/>\nour financial decisions. Its challenging bc his input was never <br/>\nsought in the past - he lacks a whole lot of tools in this area, <br/>\nincluding the tools to discuss the matter without belittling his own <br/>\nwants and needs. Offerring him an allowance has been one way to help <br/>\nhim start to develop some of those tools without dumping him into <br/>\nthe deep end, so to speak. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you should or shouldn&#39;t do xyz, just throwing out <br/>\nsome different (possibly) dynamics and ways of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or we could help him find a way to make up a job for himself to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>earn<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; his own money just as each of us made up our own jobs.

We gave him 3 days to research each idea. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You obviously gave this a Lot of careful consideration! Is there a <br/>\nreason for the three things and three days, though? Was he in a <br/>\nhurry? Could you have offered him some of your personal spending <br/>\nmoney for a month or two to figure this out? It sounds as though <br/>\ny&#39;all found a solution that everyone in the family is happy with, <br/>\nand I&#39;m not trying to put that down, but certainly my stepson would <br/>\nbe overwhelmed by that kind of pressure - his background and <br/>\npersonality just wouldn&#39;t support that kind of problem solving. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6yo frequently comes up with plans to make money. She&#39;s very <br/>\nactive and experimental, so we work toward letting her try these out <br/>\nwhenever possible - she wants to be involved in the finances <br/>\ndirectly if she can be. Its part of her life, after all. Again, I&#39;m <br/>\nnot saying you should or shouldn&#39;t do anything in particular, just <br/>\npainting a different picture. There doesn&#39;t *have* to be a sudden <br/>\nconversation of &quot;mom, can I have an allowance?&quot; any more than we <br/>\nhave to sit our kids down and talk about the Constitution or the <br/>\nbirds and the bees. Finances can be one of the many topics that <br/>\nswirl through our daily life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now we explained that he would need some cash to bid on items and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pay<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for any fee at flea markets when he sold those items. And that we<br/>\n&gt; would loan him the money.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What you describe in this section is more of a &quot;teachable moment&quot; <br/>\nphilosophy than unschooling. I want to be really clear about that. <br/>\nThere really isn&#39;t anything natural about creating obstacles and <br/>\nsetting projects for the sake of our kids learning a lesson, and I <br/>\nwant to talk about this and the next bit from that angle. This <br/>\ncertainly *is* me saying &quot;don&#39;t do xyz&quot; - not simply bc &quot;its not <br/>\nunschooling dogma&quot; but bc I honestly don&#39;t believe these kinds of <br/>\ncontrived lessons are useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not just give him the money, *especially* as y&#39;all don&#39;t like <br/>\nloans in general? Besides being contradictory to your own, stated <br/>\nphilosophy, in the real world there are grants, inheritances, and <br/>\noutright gifts available. I just went to the L&L conference on a <br/>\nscholarship plus a gift from a family member - I&#39;m very grateful! <br/>\nbut it has taken me years to let go of my idea that &quot;I don&#39;t just <br/>\nwant to be handed money&quot;. I&#39;ve certainly given other people money, <br/>\ntime, food, housing and the use of my posessions on more than one <br/>\noccasion, but I had an enormous amount of baggage around the idea of <br/>\nbeing the recipient of others&#39; generosity. That has held me back <br/>\nmore than once in my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We explained<br/>\n&gt; that in the real world when he needed money for a business loan, he<br/>\n&gt; would need to write a proposal that explained just what he planned <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; do with the money and how he would run his business.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the real world, if a friend you respected needed a little bit of <br/>\nmoney to get over some personal financial hump, would you ask him to <br/>\nwrite you a proposal? Maybe y&#39;all would create a paper contract, but <br/>\nchances are the conversation with that friend would *be* the <br/>\nproposal. When George wanted to buy a new truck recently he went to <br/>\nthe bank and talked to a loan officer. That conversation was his <br/>\nproposal. There was some paperwork, but the loan officer walked him <br/>\nthrough it. My dd has been to the bank on more than one occasion and <br/>\nhas seen me and her dad chat with loan officers. She&#39;s not much <br/>\ninterested in the percentage rates of our various loans, but she has <br/>\na basic grasp of what borrowing money looks like in the real world. <br/>\nIt frequently looks more like a conversation than a piece of paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone I cared about needed help writing a proposal to get a <br/>\nloan (or grant), I&#39;d help that person find the resources he or she <br/>\nneeded to write the best proposal possible. It probably wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nme, but I know who to ask. Its good to be able to utilize human <br/>\nresources in that way, but mom having kid write a proposal as a <br/>\nproject doesn&#39;t necessarily give the kid the skills to know how to <br/>\nutilize any resource other than mom. It really doesn&#39;t promote <br/>\nindependence in the way I think you hoped. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So that is the story of how we lead our son into being a right good<br/>\n&gt; businessman. We&#39;ve made quite a friends in the process. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its wonderful that your son is enjoying his enterprise. That&#39;s not <br/>\nmeant to be belittling, although I realize it may sound that way. <br/>\nPart of unschooling is helping our kids to shine in whatever they <br/>\nchoose to do, and it sounds as though your son is shining brightly <br/>\nin his endeavors, with y&#39;all&#39;s support. From an unschooling <br/>\nperspective, the shine is what&#39;s important. Of course, its easy to <br/>\nsee a shiny kid in the midst of success. Where it gets challenging <br/>\nis at the transitions and times of struggle - those are where we can <br/>\nchoose to focus on lessons for the future, or helping our kids to <br/>\nshine right now, and carry that shine into whatever the future may <br/>\nbring.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203677783,"authorName":"trektheory","from":"&quot;trektheory&quot; &lt;trektheory@...&gt;","profile":"trektheory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Public School Factories  was: Harrassment was Teasing update","postDate":"1189295473","msgId":26113,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZidmNoaCs0cW41QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2RTJDQzQ2LjIwMjA1QHR3Y255LnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26112,"nextInTopic":26114,"prevInTime":26112,"nextInTime":26114,"topicId":25160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... his ...

My kids both have an <br/>\nintense desire to be part of the earning and spending of money. I can&#39;t <br/>\neven imagine them not choosing to participate in some way in the myriad <br/>\nof ways people earn money.

Maybe this is partly because so many parents hate the way they <br/>\nthemselves have chosen to earn money.

It was really interesting reading all that,<br/>\nlong-winded tho you may have thought it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst let me say that it sounds like y&#39;all worked hard to make stuff happen<br/>\nfor him and for you.  When I look at your description and compare it against<br/>\nwhat other more schooly parents do (those who would rather just toss off &quot;We<br/>\ncan&#39;t afford it,&quot; and end of discussion), I&#39;m going, &quot;Yeah!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, here&#39;s the flip-side of my comments.  Instead of talking about how much<br/>\nbetter that was compared to others, I&#39;m more interested in  comparing it<br/>\nagainst the goals towards which I&#39;m striving.  I&#39;d like to take your<br/>\nnarrative and try to put it into an unschooling context.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, dropping into my code-review mentality (I&#39;m a software<br/>\ntester/programmer by trade), the mantra is, &quot;It&#39;s the program, not the<br/>\nprogrammer.&quot;  I&#39;m looking at stuff and commenting on and analyzing it.  No<br/>\nvalue is being assigned to you or DH or anyone else.  I am tossing around<br/>\nideas, suggestions or what-ifs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I look at your description and ask some questions.  &quot;OK, I see some<br/>\nreal good stuff here, but how could it be more unschool-like?  Was DS&#39;s<br/>\nfreedom maximized?  Were everyone&#39;s needs met?  Was there too much structure<br/>\nhere?  Not enough?  How much of the outcome/process was negotiated, and how<br/>\nmuch was pre-determined by the parents?&quot;  No judgements here, just<br/>\ndeconstructing, looking at, and analyzing.  I&#39;ll use what I get here for<br/>\nmyself later.  Maybe my ramblings will be useful to someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving along...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think it&#39;s even better for unschooling parents to strive<br/>\nto reduce or eliminate (if it can be eliminated) the imbalance of<br/>\npower between our children and ourselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been (and are) capable of more than I thought they were.  I<br/>\nfind more often than not that it is I who limit them rather than they who<br/>\nare not ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is young and<br/>\ninstead give him money over and above what I have already sacrificed to give<br/>\nhim? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm...Well, I see a couple issues here.  Hopefully I&#39;m not taking things<br/>\nout of context.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, respect for everyone&#39;s needs, including yours -- if you can&#39;t give it<br/>\nto him, then you shouldn&#39;t be expected to.  That&#39;s a strong need you have,<br/>\nand a very real one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, well, why are there only two options (have him earn money at a job<br/>\nv. give him money on top of what he gets)?  Instead of seeing the obvious<br/>\neither/or, use your own mutual needs as a starting point of negotiation.<br/>\nStart brainstorming.  In addition to opening up even more possibilities,<br/>\ndoing this may also expose other, more deeply-seated needs that trump the<br/>\nstated ones, and will allow everyone to be even more honest with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n(btw, kudos to you and DH for looking at finances, decided that you couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo it, NOT deciding off-handedly that it wasn&#39;t going to work.  And actually<br/>\nshowing him y&#39;all&#39;s finances.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this gets into the question, What are his needs?  Obviously, he wants<br/>\nmoney so he can buy some things on his own.  But what will buying his own<br/>\nstuff give him?  Maybe it&#39;s a peer pressure thing, a way to be seen as equal<br/>\namong his friends.  Perhaps it&#39;s a need to feel more autonomous.  His<br/>\nfriends have spending money that gives them a certain amount of &quot;freedom&quot;<br/>\nwhich he doesn&#39;t have.  Now, having money would certainly meet those needs,<br/>\nbut maybe something else would as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may even know the answer to these questions, but perhaps you see my<br/>\npoint.  There can be stuff underlying what&#39;s presented to us, and it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant we have as full a picture as possible.  Also note that it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant for you to realize what your true needs are.  Bizarre as it may<br/>\nsound, &quot;being able to pay the bills&quot; may have an underlying need under it.<br/>\nAnd it may not be the one you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I understand your description, DS had either the option of an<br/>\nallowance which would be dipped into regularly, or he could come up with a<br/>\njob.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were possible to view parallel universes, it might be interesting to<br/>\nwitness the following scenario:<br/>\nPresent the situation to him.  Repeat back to him what you understand his<br/>\nneeds to be, and make sure he agrees with this.  Present to him your needs.<br/>\nState that you know this matters to him, and that you and DH are committed<br/>\nto working with him on it.  Next, ask if he has any ideas about solving this<br/>\ndilemma (contrast that with overtly suggesting that he find some kind of<br/>\njob).  Perhaps work with him on where to get ideas, if he is open to that.<br/>\nYou might also mention that you and DH have some ideas, and ask if he would<br/>\nlike to hear any them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing all this takes even more time and energy, sure.  But it also lets in<br/>\nmore future possibilities, different ideas, etc.  (No, I can&#39;t think of any,<br/>\nbut that doesn&#39;t mean DS can&#39;t.)  And even if DS would still wind up doing<br/>\nwhat he&#39;s doing now, there&#39;s now even MORE trust and respect in y&#39;all&#39;s<br/>\nrelationship than there is currently.  It sounds like there&#39;s already a good<br/>\namount there.  Imagine notching it up even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd diverging on to the cleanliness issue...<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children do not always learn the lesson we try to teach.  I may be<br/>\nteaching cleanliness by insisting that my children pick up their toys after<br/>\nthey are done.  Perhaps the lesson they are actually learning is that<br/>\nsometimes Dad is a real jerk, or that Dad can be scary (I&#39;m not always<br/>\ncalm), and to be afraid of him.

What if it was <br/>\n&gt; Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad?   If  someone is in need it is NOT more <br/>\n&gt; generous to teach them a lesson than it is to help them <br/>\n&gt; immediately.   One of the beautiful things about unschooling is that <br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t set a predetermined course and rate of speed for our <br/>\n&gt; kids.  We neither hinder nor hurry them. No one needs to learn to <br/>\n&gt; fish at eleven.&lt;g&gt;  No one should be prevented from fishing if they <br/>\n&gt; want to, (fishing is metaphor for learning)  but the choice to fish <br/>\n&gt; or not to fish should be up to the individual, not the individual&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; mom. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (That saying implies a hungry man, with an ocean full of tasty fish <br/>\n&gt; nearby is such a dolt he&#39;d never figure out he could get his own damn <br/>\n&gt; fish if you first gave him a fish.  It might sound like something, <br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s crap. (or is that carp?)  Hunger isn&#39;t caused by a lack of <br/>\n&gt; willingness of hungry people to try to get food.)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;*** Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>\n&gt; hands.&quot; *** <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sweeping isn&#39;t genetically programmed like walking.  Mom&#39;s don&#39;t make <br/>\n&gt; their kids walk by saying a few encouraging words.   Some people <br/>\n&gt; might find that sweeping up helps them have a better quality of life <br/>\n&gt; but not all people care about clean or dirty floors.  Not all people <br/>\n&gt; live where there are floors to sweep and dishes to wash, but all <br/>\n&gt; people who are physiologically able, walk.   Mom&#39;s can make their <br/>\n&gt; kids sweep up though, because of that power imbalance mentioned <br/>\n&gt; earlier it can be that kids comply with a parents wishes not because <br/>\n&gt; they see value in the task they&#39;ve been assigned but because they <br/>\n&gt; feel pressured to do what they&#39;re told out of fear of punishment or <br/>\n&gt; some other misery if they don&#39;t comply.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A kid can only naturally help with household things if he&#39;s free to <br/>\n&gt; help or not help.   If a thing is valuable to an individual then that <br/>\n&gt; person will do that thing.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***...since he is a part of the<br/>\n&gt; family then he is a part of the chores which we do together as a<br/>\n&gt; family.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a significant difference.  It&#39;s the parents set the standards <br/>\n&gt; for cleanliness that they then expect the children to adopt as their <br/>\n&gt; own and live up to.  Requiring a child to do chores in a home <br/>\n&gt; selected by the parents to a standard set by the parents is not the <br/>\n&gt; same as the inborn desire and physiological drive of humans to <br/>\n&gt; acquire language and to walk.   Maybe he&#39;s happy to help out and <br/>\n&gt; never questions your system.  But what if he does?  If he doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to clean the toilet next time can he skip it?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Learning is natural but that doesn&#39;t mean all things learned have the <br/>\n&gt; same value to the individual.  Walking and talking will be valuable <br/>\n&gt; for your son&#39;s lifetime.  Sweeping may or may not be.  The learning <br/>\n&gt; of all those things can be done naturally.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***No one likes to clean the toilet so we each take it in<br/>\n&gt; turns. ***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So because no one likes it everyone has to do it?   Would it make <br/>\n&gt; sense to fix a meal you knew absolutely no one would enjoy?  Would <br/>\n&gt; you go on vacation to a place no one wanted to go?  Would you rent a <br/>\n&gt; movie no one wanted to see?  If you believe the toilet must be <br/>\n&gt; maintained at a certain level then take responsibility for that <br/>\n&gt; conviction and be the one to clean the pot.  I think of cleaning as a <br/>\n&gt; gift I can give my family, to make our little house of chipping paint <br/>\n&gt; and second hand store furniture a place of peace and comfort.  I <br/>\n&gt; worked as a housekeeper in a motel and if there&#39;s anything can make <br/>\n&gt; you see cleaning your own bathroom as a very pleasant task it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; cleaning up after a motel full burly hunters who are subsisting for a <br/>\n&gt; week on chewing tobacco and sausages and beer. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***If we didn&#39;t organize it that way, then it would never get<br/>\n&gt; cleaned.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could clean it.  You could hire it cleaned.  You could barter it <br/>\n&gt; cleaned.  You could trade with a friend who just loves shining <br/>\n&gt; porcelain and do her laundry or mow her lawn.  By saying it would <br/>\n&gt; NEVER get cleaned are you telling us that you yourself would refuse <br/>\n&gt; to clean it if it was not your turn and you saw that it was grimy?   <br/>\n&gt; Put a bleach disc in the tank.  Put a box of premoistened cleaning <br/>\n&gt; towels on the back of the toilet.  Every morning when you get up go <br/>\n&gt; wipe off the toilet.  It&#39;s not a big deal, it takes about one minute, <br/>\n&gt; it gets done every day, you&#39;re not making anyone else live up to your <br/>\n&gt; standard for a clean toilet. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kid helps with some housework too, so I know kids help generously <br/>\n&gt; and willingly.  The difference in an unschooling family is that kids <br/>\n&gt; come to help with cleaning because they want to, not because parents <br/>\n&gt; decide they should.   The same reasoning applies to chores as applies <br/>\n&gt; to math and reading.   When a person sees value in reading and is <br/>\n&gt; ready he will learn to read. That person might always just read what <br/>\n&gt; he needs in order to get by and never have a desire to read the <br/>\n&gt; classics or read for pleasure.   When a person understands the value <br/>\n&gt; of being able to figure out if he has enough money for  two toys or <br/>\n&gt; three and wants to be able to figure change, and when his brain is <br/>\n&gt; ready, he learns to count and add and subtract.  He may never feel <br/>\n&gt; the need to learn higher math.  When a kid sees the benefit of a tidy <br/>\n&gt; house and when he is ready he will learn to do some things to make <br/>\n&gt; his environment more comfortable.  He may never feel the need for <br/>\n&gt; perfect cleanliness and spotless floors or a toilet cleaned every day.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; ***we ALL abide by it so that we<br/>\n&gt; may live comfortably and without the stench of filth.***<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not an ambitious housekeeper.

I hope unschooling parents think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-511864037\">Since this is an unschooling discussion list, I&#39;m looking at what you <br/>\nwrote about one incident in the light of unschooling.   I hope <br/>\nunschooling parents think about that idea of &quot;just handing&quot; children <br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\nLot&#39;s of time parents who write that their kid is part of the family <br/>\nand so should share part in the housework, don&#39;t feel that the kid is <br/>\nenough a part of the family to share in some pocket money.  So I want <br/>\nto ramble a little about the notion of &quot;just handing&quot; someone money, <br/>\nwhich makes it sound very much like they&#39;re not honestly worthy of <br/>\ncash unless the parent gets something out of the deal too. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my family, my husband has been the wage earner all of Dylan&#39;s <br/>\n(ds&#39;s) life.  I&#39;ve made a little money here or there but David has <br/>\npaid the mortgage and the bills and the big stuff.  When I want money <br/>\nI take it (if we have it&lt;g&gt;)  If he ever said to or about me that <br/>\ninstead of &quot;just handing&quot; me money I should think of ways to earn <br/>\nsome I&#39;d be positively snorty and it would not help me think kindly <br/>\nof him.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt used to be there was a substantial imbalance of power between wage <br/>\nearning men and non wage earning women in marriage.  Women often had <br/>\nto ask for money for things they needed or wanted that were beyond <br/>\nthe necessities of keeping a home.   Imagine if your household had <br/>\nmoney but your partner chose instead to teach you a lesson and asked <br/>\nyou to find ways to earn extra money.  Would that feel good?  Would <br/>\nyour relationship with your partner be helped by his or her efforts <br/>\nto control and manipulate you?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wrote before, I think it&#39;s fine to help someone think of ways to <br/>\nearn money.  But not if it&#39;s a manipulation to provide a &quot;lesson&quot; one <br/>\nperson (an adult) thinks the other person (a child) should now <br/>\nlearn.  I think it&#39;s even better for unschooling  parents to strive <br/>\nto reduce or eliminate (if it can be eliminated) the imbalance of <br/>\npower between our children and ourselves.  Help is better than a <br/>\nlesson. It will help your understanding of unschooling to weigh the <br/>\neffect and value of trying to teach someone a lesson against the <br/>\neffect and value of offering honest help and support without <br/>\nmanipulation. <br/>\n<br/>\n***If unschooling is about learning by experiencing the world, then <br/>\nwhy<br/>\nis helping a child to earn money instead of giving an allowance not a<br/>\npart of it? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is partly about understanding that our kids will learn <br/>\nwhat they need without us teaching lessons. That&#39;s a very basic <br/>\nconcept of unschooling, that learning is natural and does not require <br/>\nteaching. <br/>\nHelping a child earn money, if that&#39;s what he wants to do, is very <br/>\nkind and in keeping with the principles of unschooling.   Not sharing <br/>\nfamily money for the purpose of teaching someone a lesson is not.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is it not a fact that when my son becomes a man he will need to <br/>\nearn a<br/>\nliving? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe and maybe not.  There are many things we cannot know.  I know <br/>\nthree adult men who are husbands and fathers who do not &quot;earn a <br/>\nliving,&quot; so it is not a fact that all men need to earn a living.   <br/>\nThe world changes fast.  There are things we can&#39;t conceive of that <br/>\nour kids will be living with in the future.  Life will be different <br/>\nfor them than it is for us.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is<br/>\nyoung and instead give him money over and above what I have already<br/>\nsacrificed to give him? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you use the phrase &quot;spare him?&quot;   Helping someone think of <br/>\nways to earn money, if that&#39;s what they want, no matter their age, is <br/>\na nice thing to do.  Sharing family money with family members is a <br/>\nnice thing to do.  It is not an either/ or situation.   One is not <br/>\nrequired to give children money in order to &quot;spare&quot; them the <br/>\n(apparently hideous necessity? ) of earning money.    Nor should a <br/>\nchild have to earn his own money in order to have the things he wants <br/>\nif other family members have spending money.  What is it that you <br/>\nbelieve you sacrificed that he is not entitled to as your child?   As <br/>\nparents we get to make all the choices about the way we live with our <br/>\nchildren.   It will help  parents who want to unschool to understand <br/>\nthat the choices they make can build their relationship with their <br/>\nchildren or can undermine their relationship.  Choices that build our <br/>\nrelationships are better for unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope parents who think of parenting as a sacrifice can change their <br/>\nthinking and consider the generosity and kindness we show our kids to <br/>\nbe a choice we make that is as much for our emotional well being as <br/>\nit is our kids.   If there are any sacrifices in a parent child <br/>\nrelationship it is almost always the child making sacrifices, having <br/>\nno choice about being born, about what kind of parents he gets, about <br/>\nwhether he ends up with siblings about what foods are in the house, <br/>\nand then be subjected to his parents brand of parenting which almost <br/>\nalways includes some system of punishment - taking away his things, <br/>\nhis freedom, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nParents sacrifice my ass.   If you don&#39;t want your life changed by <br/>\nkids don&#39;t have kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Or should I give him money and have him do<br/>\nwithout the things I gave him previously unless he spends the money?<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nThose aren&#39;t your only choices.&lt;go&gt;  As parents we can make the <br/>\nchoice to be as considerate of our kids as we are of ourselves and <br/>\nour partners.  He could have parents who get him all of what he needs <br/>\nand as much of what he wants as they can afford AND some spending <br/>\nmoney of his own.   That&#39;s a good option that will show him how to be <br/>\ngenerous with his own kids one day.  I&#39;m not saying it was a bad idea <br/>\nto help him start his own business.  I&#39;m looking at the other stuff.  <br/>\nThat you decided he needed to learn a lesson about money, that you <br/>\ndecided he wasn&#39;t worth twenty bucks a month of your own spending <br/>\nmoney. <br/>\n<br/>\n***And what will that do to the attitude of the man I see him rapidly<br/>\nbecoming? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s eleven, right?  I think if he lives with generous people who <br/>\nhelp him when he needs help and who don&#39;t try to manipulate him, he <br/>\nwill be a generous and helpful man.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*** I&#39;m sure you have heard the saying &quot;Give a man a fish; you<br/>\nhave fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for<br/>\na lifetime.&quot; So which of the two is more generous,***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a problem with that saying. &lt;g&gt;  Anyone who ever ate a fish <br/>\ncan figure out how to catch a fish.  It&#39;s not rocket science. It&#39;s so <br/>\neasy even a caveman could do it. &lt;g&gt;  And really, if a man came to <br/>\nyour door, hungry would you feed the poor bugger or would you make <br/>\nhim first go earn the money to buy some food to eat?   What if it was <br/>\nJesus or Buddha or Muhammad?   If  someone is in need it is NOT more <br/>\ngenerous to teach them a lesson than it is to help them <br/>\nimmediately.   One of the beautiful things about unschooling is that <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t set a predetermined course and rate of speed for our <br/>\nkids.  We neither hinder nor hurry them. No one needs to learn to <br/>\nfish at eleven.&lt;g&gt;  No one should be prevented from fishing if they <br/>\nwant to, (fishing is metaphor for learning)  but the choice to fish <br/>\nor not to fish should be up to the individual, not the individual&#39;s <br/>\nmom. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n(That saying implies a hungry man, with an ocean full of tasty fish <br/>\nnearby is such a dolt he&#39;d never figure out he could get his own damn <br/>\nfish if you first gave him a fish.  It might sound like something, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s crap. (or is that carp?)  Hunger isn&#39;t caused by a lack of <br/>\nwillingness of hungry people to try to get food.)<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;*** Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>\nhands.&quot; *** <br/>\n<br/>\nSweeping isn&#39;t genetically programmed like walking.  Mom&#39;s don&#39;t make <br/>\ntheir kids walk by saying a few encouraging words.   Some people <br/>\nmight find that sweeping up helps them have a better quality of life <br/>\nbut not all people care about clean or dirty floors.  Not all people <br/>\nlive where there are floors to sweep and dishes to wash, but all <br/>\npeople who are physiologically able, walk.   Mom&#39;s can make their <br/>\nkids sweep up though, because of that power imbalance mentioned <br/>\nearlier it can be that kids comply with a parents wishes not because <br/>\nthey see value in the task they&#39;ve been assigned but because they <br/>\nfeel pressured to do what they&#39;re told out of fear of punishment or <br/>\nsome other misery if they don&#39;t comply.   <br/>\n<br/>\nA kid can only naturally help with household things if he&#39;s free to <br/>\nhelp or not help.   If a thing is valuable to an individual then that <br/>\nperson will do that thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***...since he is a part of the<br/>\nfamily then he is a part of the chores which we do together as a<br/>\nfamily.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a significant difference.  It&#39;s the parents set the standards <br/>\nfor cleanliness that they then expect the children to adopt as their <br/>\nown and live up to.  Requiring a child to do chores in a home <br/>\nselected by the parents to a standard set by the parents is not the <br/>\nsame as the inborn desire and physiological drive of humans to <br/>\nacquire language and to walk.   Maybe he&#39;s happy to help out and <br/>\nnever questions your system.  But what if he does?  If he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to clean the toilet next time can he skip it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is natural but that doesn&#39;t mean all things learned have the <br/>\nsame value to the individual.  Walking and talking will be valuable <br/>\nfor your son&#39;s lifetime.  Sweeping may or may not be.  The learning <br/>\nof all those things can be done naturally.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***No one likes to clean the toilet so we each take it in<br/>\nturns. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because no one likes it everyone has to do it?   Would it make <br/>\nsense to fix a meal you knew absolutely no one would enjoy?  Would <br/>\nyou go on vacation to a place no one wanted to go?  Would you rent a <br/>\nmovie no one wanted to see?  If you believe the toilet must be <br/>\nmaintained at a certain level then take responsibility for that <br/>\nconviction and be the one to clean the pot.  I think of cleaning as a <br/>\ngift I can give my family, to make our little house of chipping paint <br/>\nand second hand store furniture a place of peace and comfort.  I <br/>\nworked as a housekeeper in a motel and if there&#39;s anything can make <br/>\nyou see cleaning your own bathroom as a very pleasant task it&#39;s <br/>\ncleaning up after a motel full burly hunters who are subsisting for a <br/>\nweek on chewing tobacco and sausages and beer. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***If we didn&#39;t organize it that way, then it would never get<br/>\ncleaned.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could clean it.  You could hire it cleaned.  You could barter it <br/>\ncleaned.  You could trade with a friend who just loves shining <br/>\nporcelain and do her laundry or mow her lawn.  By saying it would <br/>\nNEVER get cleaned are you telling us that you yourself would refuse <br/>\nto clean it if it was not your turn and you saw that it was grimy?   <br/>\nPut a bleach disc in the tank.  Put a box of premoistened cleaning <br/>\ntowels on the back of the toilet.  Every morning when you get up go <br/>\nwipe off the toilet.  It&#39;s not a big deal, it takes about one minute, <br/>\nit gets done every day, you&#39;re not making anyone else live up to your <br/>\nstandard for a clean toilet. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid helps with some housework too, so I know kids help generously <br/>\nand willingly.

Oh well...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a long story... And I get wordy sometimes so bear with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what happened. DS came to me and said something like. &quot;My<br/>\nfriends get $20 a week from their parents for allowance. I think I<br/>\nshould get $20 a week so I can buy some things on my own. Plus one guy<br/>\nI know gets $40 a month to mow the lawn and clean his room AND<br/>\nallowance. I think I should be paid to mow the lawn and clean my room.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Answer. &quot;Hmm let me discuss this with Pop.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our private discussion we decided that not only could we not afford<br/>\n it and still support our boy&#39;s bike racing sport, this would be an<br/>\nopportunity to help him to become more independent and learn about the<br/>\neconomics of the household. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter looking over the finances we all sat down and had a discussion<br/>\nabout it. We explained just how much money we have and just how much<br/>\nwe must spend each month on basic bills. Both DH & I run home based<br/>\nbusinesses so I keep a record of income and budget for each and for<br/>\nthe household. I showed him the records. Our businesses support us but<br/>\noftentimes we are pretty well strapped for cash. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe then explained that if we gave him that much allowance and paid him<br/>\nthat much for chores he has been doing for free, then we wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nable to pay for things that we normally buy for him: bicycle race<br/>\nentry fees, tires and other upkeep on the bike, and practice sessions,<br/>\ngas money to get to those races, etc. So if he still wanted to get<br/>\nthose things it would often have to come out of his allowance. (He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t like that idea because he wanted money in addition to those fun<br/>\nthings.) <br/>\n<br/>\nOr we could help him find a way to make up a job for himself to earn<br/>\nhis own money just as each of us made up our own jobs. We told him to<br/>\nthink of 3 things that he thought he would like to try and we would<br/>\nsee how we could help. We gave him 3 days to research each idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis first idea was learning to make chainsaw carvings to sell. That&#39;s<br/>\nwhat I do. I explained to him that it&#39;s too dangerous for a little<br/>\nboy. Maybe I&#39;ll teach him to carve with a chainsaw when he is bigger<br/>\nand stronger. I offered my smaller tools and lessons. He tried some<br/>\nsmaller carvings but didn&#39;t have the patience for it. Maybe later...<br/>\n<br/>\nHis second idea was bicycle repair and sales. Which is what DH does.<br/>\nHonestly this is also one for an older boy. People who ride seriously<br/>\ntend to not want to leave their bike with a very young boy to be<br/>\nrepaired. No matter how competent he happens to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nHis last idea was simply Yard Sales or flea markets. Which is fine<br/>\nonce or twice with your own junk errr merchandise. But we asked him<br/>\n&quot;How are you going to keep getting things to sell? You have to keep<br/>\ngetting items or once you run out of your own things, you won&#39;t have a<br/>\nbusiness any more.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThat day, he and I Googled &quot;wholesale items&quot; and found a weekly<br/>\nwholesale auction in our area. The first week we just watched. He<br/>\nwanted to bid on items but I told him that he had to watch to see how<br/>\nit is done and to be careful about bidding. When we got home he was SO<br/>\nexcited I thought he would never stop talking about that auction and<br/>\nwhat he could get for such cheap prices. That one experience made him<br/>\ninto one very savvy shopper. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we explained that he would need some cash to bid on items and pay<br/>\nfor any fee at flea markets when he sold those items. And that we<br/>\nwould loan him the money. We made a project out of it. We explained<br/>\nthat in the real world when he needed money for a business loan, he<br/>\nwould need to write a proposal that explained just what he planned to<br/>\ndo with the money and how he would run his business. Also how and when<br/>\nhe would pay the loan. His proposal was addressed to &quot;The Bank of Mom<br/>\nand Pop&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bank of Mom & Pop loaned the young entrepreneur enough to bid on<br/>\nitems to fill a flea market table, pay table fees, and gas money to<br/>\nget there on the first trip. After that he was responsible for<br/>\ncovering all his overhead costs and paying back the loan. Which he did.<br/>\n <br/>\nSince then he has discovered several more auctions, a few more flea<br/>\nmarkets, and eBay. His little business does very well over all. He has<br/>\nmade some wise choices and some not so wise. Only once has he returned<br/>\nto the Bank of Mom & Pop when he wanted to buy something that was a<br/>\nGREAT DEAL. But we didn&#39;t have that much money at the time. So instead<br/>\nof missing out on that great deal, he negotiated with another adult<br/>\nmerchant to share the deal. They both came out quite well. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first we bid on his behalf but now most of the auctioneers know him<br/>\nand accept bids from him. Though we accompany him to auctions and flea<br/>\nmarkets, we do not speak for him. If he looks to us for advice we give<br/>\nit. But we have gotten used to saying &quot;These are his things. You need<br/>\nto speak with him.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he asks if he should buy something I nearly always respond with<br/>\nquestions. &quot;Do you think you can make a profit? What&#39;s your target<br/>\nmarket? Who would buy it? Where would you sell it?&quot; If he asks me if I<br/>\nthink he should take an offer on an item I nearly always answer &quot;If<br/>\nyou take that offer, are you making enough to suit you?

She has in the past sold some of her <br/>\nunwanted toys on ebay. She really loves to be able to shop often, she <br/>\nloves shopping sprees.

My <br/>\nhusband made a similar choice and is in the trades as he much prefers to <br/>\nbe independent and not work in an office. He makes good money when he <br/>\nworks, but he has times of not working, no health insurance, etc. We <br/>\nchoose to live in an area that is somewhat depressed, to be near family <br/>\nand to have all the other advantages of living in an area that is less <br/>\ncrowded, more home schoolers, etc. However this leaves us not able to <br/>\nafford all the things the kids want all the time. When they were <br/>\nfrustrated by this we have talked about the choices we made, and they <br/>\nhaven&#39;t asked us to make different ones, though I would consider it. One <br/>\nthing we did offer them was to help them figure out ways to bring in <br/>\nmoney from outside the family, and have supported them when they chose this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always bought used clothing, and the kids don&#39;t always want to <br/>\ndo this anymore.

Then how can you make a judgment about the<br/>\namount of generosity I show to my son? You know nothing of my family<br/>\nlife or circumstances. It is not a matter of not wanting to share with<br/>\nfamily members. As far as sharing is concerned... We give our son the<br/>\nbest that we can afford without creating debt. And have often gone<br/>\nwithout the extras in order to make sure he has the extra things that<br/>\nmake him happy beyond his necessities. So he was already spending<br/>\nmoney though it went from my hand to the merchant. The items he wanted<br/>\nwent to him. He understood that. When he asked for allowance he was<br/>\nasking for a way to have money that was his own... bypassing us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf unschooling is about learning by experiencing the world, then why<br/>\nis helping a child to earn money instead of giving an allowance not a<br/>\npart of it? Which do you think makes the boy happier? Discovering that<br/>\nhe can earn $100 a week or more by doing something he really enjoys,<br/>\nor us opening a wallet to give him $20 a week which is what he<br/>\nrequested. I feel that this was a great opportunity for a lesson... <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it not a fact that when my son becomes a man he will need to earn a<br/>\nliving? Shall I then spare my child from earning money while he is<br/>\nyoung and instead give him money over and above what I have already<br/>\nsacrificed to give him? Or should I give him money and have him do<br/>\nwithout the things I gave him previously unless he spends the money?<br/>\nAnd what will that do to the attitude of the man I see him rapidly<br/>\nbecoming? Will he expect to be given money? Probably not... but I<br/>\nstill believe he is better for my leading into learning to manage a<br/>\nbusiness. I&#39;m sure you have heard the saying &quot;Give a man a fish; you<br/>\nhave fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for<br/>\na lifetime.&quot; So which of the two is more generous, meeting an<br/>\nimmediate need, or helping one learn to meet that need independently<br/>\nboth now and in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as chores are concerned, we as a family rotate certain tasks.<br/>\nWe ALL get up and do them together at the same time every day.Not by<br/>\nschedule but by habit. He has been in the habit of helping since he<br/>\nwas able to pick up a broom and sweep or vacuum a floor. We handled<br/>\nthis by simply saying &quot;Here... it&#39;s your turn... you can do it. I&#39;ll<br/>\nhelp.&quot; Similar to &quot;OK take a step. You can do it. I&#39;ll hold your<br/>\nhands.&quot; And he has never questioned that since he is a part of the<br/>\nfamily then he is a part of the chores which we do together as a<br/>\nfamily. How is this not like walking and talking? It is simply a fact<br/>\nof our lives. No one likes to clean the toilet so we each take it in<br/>\nturns. If we didn&#39;t organize it that way, then it would never get<br/>\ncleaned. My days are Sunday and Wednesday. It is the adults in the<br/>\nfamily who came up with this system but we ALL abide by it so that we<br/>\nmay live comfortably and without the stench of filth. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes it was very generous of him to buy the well pump. However we did<br/>\nnot ask for his money. We didn&#39;t even ask for a loan although he at<br/>\nfirst suggested it to be a loan. We were planning to use the card...<br/>\nIf he had asked me to think of ways to earn more money, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave been surprised. We went for a week without running water. <br/>\nSo I had asked myself that very question several times before he<br/>\noffered to buy the well pump. Most questions are helpful if worded in<br/>\na positive manner so as to lead you to new thoughts which are positive. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think the best of my son. However his actions surprised me. Not<br/>\nbecause he showed me more generosity that I have shown him, but<br/>\nbecause he had been saving to buy a very expensive racing bike. He has<br/>\nwanted that bike for about two years and we simply could not afford<br/>\nit. He had saved nearly enough to buy the bike a little more than the<br/>\nwell pump costs. So when he said not to pay him back, I was stunned. I<br/>\nknow how much he wants the bike and we had originally agreed that this<br/>\nwas a loan. But then maybe the generosity that I have shown him in<br/>\nother matters affected his decision. I should hope so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***He asked for an allowance several months ago.

I have pretty well talked my<br/>\nentire family into homeschooling or unschooling with my theories of<br/>\nprogrammed factory workers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have wondered about the relative maturity of teens. My<br/>\ngrandparents were married at the ages of 14 & 15. They had a household<br/>\nand children when they were 15 & 16. My grandfather went on to become<br/>\nan engineer for the Navy during WWII. Hr lied about his age...<br/>\nalthough he the Navy gave training, he never actually graduated high<br/>\nschool. And he was one of the most brilliant people I have ever met.<br/>\nThey stayed together for their entire lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nI personally had a MUCH longer childhood. And was not prepared for<br/>\nlife as an adult when it was first required of me. I have had the same<br/>\nconcerns about my son with our version of education. Then he does<br/>\nthings that amaze me...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asked for an allowance several months ago. Instead of just hading<br/>\nhim money, we asked him to think of how he could earn some money.

He usually makes about<br/>\n$100 a week now... quite a lot for an 11 year old boy and much more<br/>\nthan what he requested in allowance. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the really amazing thing. This month our well pump stopped<br/>\nworking. We as a family try to avoid borrowing money. But when this<br/>\nhappened we were just not prepared due to an incident with the car the<br/>\nmoth before which had taken our ready savings. But guess who had<br/>\nenough money to buy a new well pump? Then when I tried to pay him back<br/>\nthis week he said &quot;Oh you don&#39;t have to pay me back.

I arrived a minute or two<br/>\nbefore the bell rang whereupon I had 5 minutes to get to my station<br/>\nand begin working. An hour later the bell would ring again and I would<br/>\ngo to a different station and do a different sort of work. This<br/>\nhappened every hour and bells also rang for lunch and break time when<br/>\nwe could all crowd into a little smoking area outside for a few<br/>\nminutes to talk. The only difference was that I called the teacher the<br/>\nline coach and the principal was called the manager. Oh and I got a<br/>\nsmall paycheck and went home to my own apartment not my parents house.<br/>\nBut my joy came when the last bell of the shift rang and I could go home. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the same people I &quot;worked&quot; with in high school were there<br/>\nworking in that factory. Many of them are STILL there. And factory<br/>\nwork is an honest living.
