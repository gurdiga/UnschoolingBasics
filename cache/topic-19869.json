There was a great study, that I went looking for, but didn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; find<br/>\n&gt; (I probably didn&#39;t look long enough, really) that found that parents who<br/>\n&gt; were told their children had sugar found that they had hyperactive <br/>\n&gt; children<br/>\n&gt; even if the children hadn&#39;t had sugar, and vice versa. In looking for<br/>\n&gt; studies I found this (<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Frepositories.cdlib.org%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1008%26context%3Duclabiolchem%2Fnutritionbytes&ei=N4WFRdCIGJ2WnQOI5ul_&usg=__nTZOn7yQXgvAiX8bHYLVkgNoBok=&sig2=XECgP_84etJnDlVUK6QEsA\">http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Frepositories.cdlib.org%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1008%26context%3Duclabiolchem%2Fnutritionbytes&ei=N4WFRdCIGJ2WnQOI5ul_&usg=__nTZOn7yQXgvAiX8bHYLVkgNoBok=&sig2=XECgP_84etJnDlVUK6QEsA</a> )<br/>\n&gt; article that concludes by saying:<br/>\n&gt; Sugar continues to be condemned as a source of hyperactivity in children.<br/>\n&gt; When I casually asked 10 of myfellow medical school classmates to tell me<br/>\n&gt; their opinions on the sugar-hyperactivity issue, seven of themdescribed at<br/>\n&gt; length the detrimental powers of sugar on childhood behavior. Clearly, <br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; attitudes need tobe corrected so that they are not communicated to future<br/>\n&gt; patients. Again, there is no available evidence thatsugar precipitates or<br/>\n&gt; even contributes to elevated activity in children who are normal or those<br/>\n&gt; who suffer from ADHD. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate and<br/>\n&gt; unnecessarily burdensome to pursue a sugar-free diet in the hope of<br/>\n&gt; ameliorating a child&#39;s disordered behavior. In fact, in light of the<br/>\n&gt; foregoing discussion, itis probably safe to conclude that withholding <br/>\n&gt; sweet<br/>\n&gt; food from youngsters is probably more likey toprovoke disruptive behavior<br/>\n&gt; than serving it to them.<br/>\n&gt; The one study that I found to show a link between sugar and behavior was<br/>\n&gt; done in 1980 and has not been replicated since.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; There is a link between behavior and food coloring. But it is slight and<br/>\n&gt; barely replicated. That is, the effect seems to be very slight, and only<br/>\n&gt; occurs in very tight studies of behavior and ADHD children and not within<br/>\n&gt; the population as a whole, and it is only occasionally found by <br/>\n&gt; researchers.<br/>\n&gt; And even among ADHD participants the results seem to not be particularly<br/>\n&gt; tight. And while there are allergies to foods, things like celiacs, or the<br/>\n&gt; milk allergy I had as a child, it doesn&#39;t always remain, I can drink milk<br/>\n&gt; tell the cows come home, and then drink what they bring. Nor is it <br/>\n&gt; something<br/>\n&gt; that all children have.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is all to say that Deb is absolutely right, it is easy to blame<br/>\n&gt; external factors (I blame PMS at least once a month) when it is something<br/>\n&gt; that a parent could address more readily, more directly, with care and<br/>\n&gt; attention. It seems that if someone&#39;s child isn&#39;t reacting to anything<br/>\n&gt; severely than maybe it isn&#39;t a culprit anymore. And making the world<br/>\n&gt; smaller, shrinking the food available to them, deciding that video games <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; inherently violent, unschooling everything but math and reading, it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; unschooling anymore.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; www.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: &quot;unschoolingbasics&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, December 15, 2006 7:33 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Questions from an absolute newcomer to <br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; idea...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; ***she doesn&#39;t have reactions that are severe or necessarily immediate so<br/>\n&gt;&gt; pinpointing the culprits can be difficult.***<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I asked because I have seen parents blame perfectly normal kid behaviors<br/>\n&gt;&gt; on<br/>\n&gt;&gt; foods or chemical additives when the kid is FINE and the parent happens <br/>\n&gt;&gt; to<br/>\n&gt;&gt; be extremely sensitive.   So a parent who is sensitive to noise or motion<br/>\n&gt;&gt; or<br/>\n&gt;&gt; who can&#39;t stand repeated sounds, cant stop the kid from doing those <br/>\n&gt;&gt; things<br/>\n&gt;&gt; and goes about trying to fix the kid.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve seen it enough to question it.   Lots of people seem to have a very<br/>\n&gt;&gt; small view of what normal kid behavior is and anything that falls outside<br/>\n&gt;&gt; that window is wrong, abnormal, obsessive - whatever.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s worth thinking about and reconsidering.  Especially for people who<br/>\n&gt;&gt; are<br/>\n&gt;&gt; interested in the unschooling philosophy.   Because when adults affix a<br/>\n&gt;&gt; label to a kid it alters that kid&#39;s psychology.   That&#39;s no small thing.<br/>\n&gt;&gt; When we convince little people who trust and believe us that they have<br/>\n&gt;&gt; some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; type of problem we change how they think of themselves.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Deb Lewis<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
