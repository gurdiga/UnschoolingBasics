And everybody was telling me how to correct my children. I had the first grandchild on both sides of the family so I did not have a big sis to help me. So I took a class on raising children. The big new fad was time out. I can proudly say that it did not work for me. I would not force physical restraint on my child. I saw this another form of child abuse (this is my concept on restraint). I would put the child in the corner not facing the wall and request the other boys to leave the room. As the child sat there with the screaming and carrying on I would give them a book. I brought big picture books on animals and other interesting subjects. Then before I know it I was sitting in the corner with the child talking about the pictures. Was it a punishment? I saw it as a way to keep the child safe and that they knew I loved them. By the time we got out of the corner I gave him a hug. The situation was taken care<br/>\n of. When we were both calm down we would talk about why I put him in the corner. Then we would both smile because Mom had a time out too and it was fun.<br/>\n  just <br/>\n  Freida<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ohpurple1@...\">ohpurple1@...</a> wrote:  In a message dated 5/10/2006 8:24:24 AM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&quot; Time outs are about the only thing I&#39;ve read to do <br/>\nin situations of aggressive behaviour.

The mainstream kind of <br/>\ntime out where you force the already frustrated, mad, sad child to sit for a <br/>\nperiod of time is going to cause more harm.  We do time outs with Mommy or <br/>\nDaddy if one of our children need it.  We cuddle, hold, rock, whisper, sing, etc. <br/>\nIts more of a distraction.  Sometimes we get pushed away if the child isn&#39;t <br/>\nready for it.  Maybe a time out from the playgroups is the answer.  If <br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t working well, we try something else.  There is always something else <br/>\nto try, too so you never run out of distractions.  The ONLY &quot;discipline&quot; that <br/>\nhas ever worked for us with a 2.5 year old is distraction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy best suggestion is to try to respond calmly even if she has slammed <br/>\nsomeone in the head with a brick.  Don&#39;t force her to apologize and end up getting <br/>\nmore agitated.  It helps to model what you want her to learn.  Next time she <br/>\nhits someone, pick her up and while you&#39;re holding her address the injured party <br/>\nand say something like:  I am so sorry Molly hit you in the head with that <br/>\nbrick.

Keep communicating with her, slow down on all<br/>\nthese playdates she&#39;s obviously NOT ready for and stay very close to<br/>\nher at all times. Jalen can only recently handle kids his age for any<br/>\nshort lengths of time and even now we have to really be careful about<br/>\nhow much interaction he can handle (he&#39;s 5).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like reading or any other thing kids learn/develop into, social<br/>\nskills come at their own pace. No amount of punishment will rush that<br/>\nprocess. She&#39;s really a baby in so many ways!! Only 2.5 years on this<br/>\nearth to figure out SO much.
