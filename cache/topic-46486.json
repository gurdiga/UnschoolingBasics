What motivates people to put in the hard work to  <br/>\n&gt; achieve their goals?  And especially, what motivates young people?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Those sound like pretty big, &quot;universal&quot; questions! I think part of the problem is that you&#39;re combining motivation and self-discipline, where for a lot of people so called &quot;self discipline&quot; is something closer to the superego - its a learned sense of duty and guilt rather than a kind of innate driving force. And sometimes a sense of duty or guilt can be helpful, but just as often those same things set up resistance. So &quot;self discipline&quot; gives us theft and adultery, binge eating and whiskey hidden in a bottle of cough syrup - it&#39;s its own worse enemy. <br/>\n<br/>\nInternal motivation doesn&#39;t depend on maturation - its how babies learn to do impossible things like walk. Maturation can provide experiences that help support one&#39;s internatl motivation or get in the way of that - so experience matters, for sure, but there seem to be personality traits that matter, too, inborn traits, I mean, that let one person rise above a bad fall, and someone else cling to the furniture a bit longer and grow up hearing &quot;you never would have done it if I hadn&#39;t helped&quot;. So nature interacts with nurture. <br/>\n<br/>\nExactly *what* motivates people is also a bit variable. For instance, some people are innately motivated by the challenges of other people - they&#39;re naturally competitive not in a mean spirited way, but in the sense that others&#39; achievements inspire them to do more and better. I&#39;m not naturally competitive, though, and tend to resist when people push me (or coax me or challenge me) to compete. That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m unmotivated, I&#39;m just motivated by other factors - but that also makes it harder for me to succeed if I&#39;m working with someone who is naturally competitive or things competition creates motivation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat motivates me to achieve a goal is the satisfaction of the process. I&#39;m more invested in processes than products much of the time, so when I lose enthusiasm for a process I lose momentum. Then what works to move me forward is a deadline. I like deadlines in that sense, but only up to a point. When a deadline is pitched to me as a kind of competition, I resist hard and tend to fall apart under the stress. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, simplistically speaking, the outcome is that I need to rethink my  <br/>\n&gt; goals, perhaps cut them down to size a bit.  I do find this  <br/>\n&gt; disappointing and often wonder if I will ever have enough of the  <br/>\n&gt; needed discipline to achieve my goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sometimes I deliberately set my own goals higher than I actually think I can achieve, just so I can cut them back when the deadline looms. This has worked really well for me with art shows - I plan on having eeeeevvvvverything done and then as the deadline approaches I start to slash and burn by way through the list of projects and pare it down *below* what I think I can accomplish. That way, if I meet my goals, good and I can take a breather, but I also know if I do meet my goals &quot;early&quot; I&#39;ll be so pumped up with enthusiasm I&#39;ll push a little more and get more done as a result. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t work so well in my job, though, because my employer is very competitive and also tends to push harder the closer we get to a deadline. So I need to manipulate the situation a little and plan on getting less done than I think I can from the start and hold back a little in the process so that I don&#39;t come unglued at the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning all of this about myself, though, has taken years. I didn&#39;t know it when I was 20. I knew some of it at 30 - a decade ago - and some of the details, like how to get my own motivational system to work in something like harmoney with my employer&#39;s I&#39;m still figuring out. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;And especially, what motivates young people?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter is 9 and has been unschooled from the start. She doesn&#39;t have outside pressure to perform or achieve for the most part, but she regularly does things she finds difficult - I mean stomping from the room in tears difficult! But she generally has a good cry and then goes back to fighting aliens in her game or figuring out the darn programming platform or learning how to fold origami or struggling to get her bike to the top of the hill without stalling. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I see in her and other unschooling kids I know is not so much a great sense of motivation as a different understanding of the nature of failure. Failure is not an end point, for Mo, its just a point on a learning curve. Sometimes she gives up, but giving up isn&#39;t failure it&#39;s a cost-benefit analysis in the moment - and most of the time, it isn&#39;t even final. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My personal experience was that I never got to find out what motivates  <br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t found out **yet**. That last little word, that&#39;s important. Take it to heart. You haven&#39;t done it yet, but that&#39;s okay, you can still learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Motivation/Discipline (the RSA video posted by Joyce)","postDate":"1302366415","msgId":46486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDQjEzNEYzLUIxOTEtNDFDMC05Nzg5LTNDMjhBRUZCRjREREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46489,"prevInTime":46485,"nextInTime":46487,"topicId":46486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Posted for someone else -- Joyce =================================== I m wondering what your thoughts are about what is the relationship between motivation and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1535424273\">Posted for someone else -- Joyce<br/>\n===================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering what your thoughts are about what is the relationship  <br/>\nbetween motivation and self-discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that personally, I struggle a lot with being disciplined which  <br/>\nin turn sabotages my ability to achieve my goals.

I do find this  <br/>\ndisappointing and often wonder if I will ever have enough of the  <br/>\nneeded discipline to achieve my goals.  I do question whether these  <br/>\ngoals are really as important to me as I think they are... and whether  <br/>\nthe lack of discipline is a result of a lack of interest more than a  <br/>\nproblem with being disciplined...
