My 11 yr old likes them as well but rarely uses the patterns and prefers to make her own pictures.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if anyone here has used the Capsela (sp?)  building sets?   My 5 yr old seems destined to be an engineer (according to a friend who is an engineer and was just like my son as a kid ha!)  Jack spends hours each day with legos, tinker toys, knex, lincoln logs and so forth... he seems to have a natural sense of symmetry seeing instantly that if you put 3 on one side the other side needs 3 to work.   His creations always must DO something (his sisters were happy for their creations to just be pretty) for him to be satisfied.   At any rate our friend said he had Capsela sets as a kid but wasn&#39;t sure if they were still around.   I haven&#39;t had a chance to look yet to see where I might find them.
