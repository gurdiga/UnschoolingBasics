I also wanted to add that for times when you would like them to be somewhat still ( like the dr office) there are a few things Ive found useful. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  weight--one of those little pillows with the pellets to sit on their lap. <br/>\n  gum--for my daughter its really calming esp when dealing with the noise of several people in a small space<br/>\n  fidget toys--small slider puzzles, stretchy slime or silly puddy, rubicks cubes, etc. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Speaking of Dr&#39;s I miss our old Dr. in texas so badly. She was in an old house and they had a fenced in playyard . So much less anxiety involved when you arent being told to be still and quiet. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!

Knowing this  we <br/>\nonly go visit like once a mnth.  Mom coming here right now isnt  an option as <br/>\nshe had a major surgery on her leg and isnt cleared to drive  more than 20 <br/>\nmiles.  Im 30 away.  Last night issues where more hed run  and play and we were <br/>\nplaying with him and the more we played the more &quot;hyper&quot;  hed get in terms of <br/>\nphysical.  Its like there is no cutoff switch for whats  ok and what crosses the <br/>\nline and just about everytime he gets really excited  someone (normally his <br/>\nsister) gets hurt.  Its not something he means to  do  more like ok my mom and <br/>\nhim where playing with blocks  building  and knocking down over and over which <br/>\nwas cool then jacob instead of hitting the  cars staged a car accident and <br/>\nslammed the car into grandma leaving a  bruise.   We avoid places that set him up <br/>\nto fail  his great  grandma is in a nursing home  we do quick 10 minute we <br/>\nlove you trips in  there.  Like I tried to stress in my last post at home we <br/>\nredirect give him  LOTS of active stimulation and flow with him, but he is <br/>\nquestioning why he  doesn&#39;t seem to be able to go places and not misbehave (the way <br/>\nhe terms  it).  For me its heartbreaking as I KNOW we have what I thought were <br/>\ngood  friends and even a few family memebers who dont invite us to do <br/>\nanything or come  over when invited because they A cant handle him or B think we just <br/>\nallow him to  be a brat.... which couldn&#39;t be furthur from the truth.  I also <br/>\nknow that  part of the mental issues is reaffirming that hes normal as in the <br/>\nfew months he  was in school the teacher had labeled him the bad jacob  there <br/>\nwere 2  jacobs  1 was the good jacob and my baby was the bad jacob,  i never  <br/>\nrealized with kids how that sticks  but recently we were in a store and a  <br/>\nlittle girl came up and said Hi Bad Jacob  her mom was shocked and asked  her <br/>\nwhy shed say that she very innocently said mommy that&#39;s what Mrs E called  him <br/>\nthe bad jacob.......

But to think that he couldn&#39;t behave  <br/>\nis ridiculous.  He should be celebrated for who he is, and what his  <br/>\nmost excellent skills are. We have two kids with autism, and because  <br/>\nit is an invisible disability, we tend to catch flak for their  <br/>\nbehavior. it&#39;s our job to protect them. it&#39;s also our job to help  <br/>\nthem if they want it. For our kids it was a matter of providing  <br/>\nsupport, providing alternatives. We&#39;ve also got a four year old who,  <br/>\nif he was in public schools, they would push for testing for adhd.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just who he is. We take him places. We allow him to get the  <br/>\nmovement he needs. Movement is how he thinks, how he learns, how he  <br/>\nlives. Taking that away would be like taking away someone&#39;s vision  <br/>\nand telling them to walk an unfamiliar path. It&#39;s not fair.<br/>\nIf other family members are getting on to him, I&#39;d be quick to step  <br/>\nin. I&#39;d not take him over there. We&#39;ve done that with our kids. And  <br/>\nwhen people ask why we&#39;re not showing up for family gatherings, i can  <br/>\nhonestly say that I will not take my children to a place where they  <br/>\nare not welcome to be who they are. If my drunk uncle can show up and  <br/>\nbe an ass, then my child can be who she is. TMI, maybe, about my family?<br/>\nOn to medication. We totally do not medicate, and will not medicate  <br/>\nany of our children. If they were old enough to ask for it, then we  <br/>\nwould talk about it, but I agree, it changes who they are. Josh has  <br/>\naspergers. When he gets stressed, we&#39;ve learned how to breath to  <br/>\nrelax. When Bre gets hyper, she gets the chance to run and bounce til  <br/>\nit&#39;s gone. We&#39;d do the same for any child. Esp with Breanna, we did a  <br/>\nlot of practice. We figured out how long she can sit. We reward her  <br/>\ngreatly for it. At age eight, she can sit for about 30 minutes at a  <br/>\nrestaurant.<br/>\nWe did give Breanna dr pepper for breakfast every morning when she  <br/>\nwas still in school because the caffeine did help (it&#39;s a stimulant,  <br/>\nwhich is what most meds for hyperactivity are). It did get to the  <br/>\npoint where she had to ingest too much for the caffeine to help (like  <br/>\nany medication, it gets to that point) there is a good book called  <br/>\n&quot;The Caffeine Adantage: how to sharpen your mind _____&quot; Something  <br/>\nlike that, we got it from our library. Good read with interesting  <br/>\npoints. Might be so much garbage, but I liked it.<br/>\nThere is also a herbal remedy called &#39;calm child&#39; . It works well,  <br/>\nhas some interesting stuff in it (like catnip...also a stimulant)  <br/>\nthat you could consider. We&#39;ve given it to Bre, not Sam.<br/>\nSam cracks me up, everyone we know loves him. We can pretty much hear  <br/>\nhim hum from the vibration he gives off, and just sitting still you  <br/>\ncan see the potential energy in him. he&#39;s emotional, can go from  <br/>\njoyous to heartbroken in a second. He&#39;s compassionate, loving,  <br/>\nfriendly, and probably the most loyal person i know. Not bad. It&#39;ll  <br/>\nserve him well, i&#39;m thinking. I&#39;d say tell your son that absolutely  <br/>\nnothing is wrong with him, but other people won&#39;t take the time to  <br/>\nunderstand his needs.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mar 4, 2006, at 6:30 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Homeschlfor2@...\">Homeschlfor2@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I personally love his energy,  I hate for  him though that others  <br/>\n&gt; including<br/>\n&gt; close family  look at him and sigh and  don&#39;t invite us over  <br/>\n&gt; because of his lack<br/>\n&gt; of attention span and what I love to  call his bounce off the ceiling<br/>\n&gt; ability!

She was the one that actually requested the trips to the dr because her anxiety over the ocd issue were getting to be to much. She knows though that she is free to stop medication at any time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So anyhow in my opinion Id gve him control over it. If he wants to say drink a mountain dew just before going to grandma&#39;s house know it will help him relax and sit still then great. Hey its a lot cheaper than all the Dr. visits and rx medications !<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Is it wrong? I personaly dont believe so and I know its a lot more right than parents who force the medications on their children just to make things easier on themselves.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  my 2 cents,<br/>\n  nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

Had my husband  been a child  now I&#39;m sure he <br/>\nwould have been highly medicated, as it is  when he was  about this age they <br/>\n(Dr and parents) gave him VALIUM, I cant imagine doing that  to a child.  Anyhow <br/>\n we knew last year for the brief amount of time he  was in Kindergarten that <br/>\nthis would be an issue if we staying in school.   As it is we pulled him and <br/>\nhis sister, jumped into un schooling and the rest I  though would be history.  <br/>\nI personally love his energy,  I hate for  him though that others including <br/>\nclose family  look at him and sigh and  don&#39;t invite us over because of his lack <br/>\nof attention span and what I love to  call his bounce off the ceiling <br/>\nability!   The reason I&#39;m looking for  guidance is that last night after being at my <br/>\nmother for a bit he tearfully  asked me what was wrong with him that he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t behave because he tried really  hard to be good but he just couldn&#39;t sit <br/>\nstill it made his head hurt   lol.  We have stumbled on by accident that a can <br/>\nof MT DEW will totally  calm him down  but I question is that is safe or right <br/>\nto do.   Medication is NOT an option for us as I don&#39;t feel that there is <br/>\nenough to prove  that there isn&#39;t long term affects.  Also his brother who was put <br/>\non  ritilan at age 5 and had med&#39;s screwed with and changed yearly suffers <br/>\nfrom HUGE  mental issues which I&#39;m my opinion is more due to med&#39;s than him.  <br/>\nThanks  for any advice and if I need to clarify anything just ask as I tend to <br/>\nramble at  time!<br/>\n <br/>\nChrissy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10439,"nextTopicId":10441}}
