He tends to have a cyclic sleep cycle - sometimes he&#39;s awake at night, other times during the day. Last night, he was asleep on the couch when DH and I went up to bed. In the kitchen at the time we had chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, pecans, cashews, raisins, chocolate cr√®me cookies (like oreos but chocolate inside and organic in nature - DS prefers them because he likes the cream inside better than oreo cream), cut up melon and pineapple in the fridge, tossed salad in the fridge, cheese - cream and cheddar, three kinds of crackers, popcorn, tuna (still in can), Cheerios, Nutella (yummy chocolate hazelnut spread similar in texture to PB), PB, jam, ice cream (and probably other stuff, just trying to get a decent cross section). Somewhere in the wee hours, he woke and made himself a plate of cheddar slices and tuna - at that hour, he could have chosen anything without us ever knowing. But, his body knew a need for protein and that&#39;s what he got. His whole life has been free-range, particularly about food (there were other things we had more difficulty wrapping our brains around). While we discuss nutrition as a family (DH and I both have health issues that involve what/how we eat) and we answer questions/make information available, DS -could- choose to eat cream cheese and saltines all day long, or ice cream, or those colored sugar water ice pops (they seem to last a long, long time at our house for some reason - I remember as a kid that we&#39;d finish off a pack of them in a matter of days if not hours so having ice cream and ice pops that last for weeks and weeks is pretty different). And, there have been times when he&#39;s wanted a very small range of foods - sometimes all carbs, sometimes sweets, sometimes oranges. So that&#39;s what we make sure to have stocked up.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHe is also asking me to locate some specific types of dentifrice for him because he wants to brush his teeth more but dislikes many typical dental things (anything minty in the least is right out for example).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSeveral months ago, we discussed the idea of giving as relates to our religious POV - not saying he &quot;should&quot; do anything, I was writing a check for our contribution at the time (he was helping me pay bills). We talked, I showed him a copy of the church budget so he could see how the money we gave from our income was spent, etc. Maybe 10 minutes discussion. Not all that different than when, in response to his question, I showed him the electric bill and how we could track how much electricity we used over the last year. This past Sunday, he grabbed a couple dollars from his wallet (from his allowance/free and clear spending money) to contribute. He may make that a habit, it might be a one-time thing to &#39;try out&#39; for now. But, either way, it&#39;s his choice/decision. (I remember getting $1 per week as a kid and of that 25 cents went to church, required, and 25 cents went to a savings account, also required. Both reasonable &#39;habits&#39; to develop but not great in terms of being a kid who is effectively getting 50 cents instead of a dollar - good practice for seeing federal and state withholding I guess - nor for determining/choosing how much to give, to save, etc - for the longest time even as an adult, giving in any circumstance was pretty much &#39;what loose change do I have convenient?&#39; rather than a conscious thought out decision to give).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty interesting watching his choices unfold free of reward/punishment/coercion\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.

I find it really hard to read tone or intention  <br/>\nonline. And I am just really not sure what you mean by your words  <br/>\nalone. Could you clarify?<br/>\n<br/>\nI see a certain amount of truth in your words but they don&#39;t quite fit  <br/>\nwith what Alex wrote. Sometimes writing it out and then rereading it  <br/>\nand then rewriting...lather rinse repeat. Will help you gain insight  <br/>\non what is going on in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour wrote originally about taking sugar from your kids (if memory  <br/>\nserves). Alex, Dana and a few others responded about how that is  <br/>\nunkind and not helpful in creating a respectful trusting life for  <br/>\nanyone. It is unkind and likely hurting your relationships<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also wrote about how unschoolers who don&#39;t do things like that are  <br/>\nlax. And again got several great responses. When someone comments like  <br/>\nthat, the words tell us that the person doesn&#39;t fully grasp the  <br/>\nconcept of unschool. One of the main premise of unschooling is to be  <br/>\npresent. Fully present and mindful, it would be challenging to be that  <br/>\nway and lax. It feels more like you are saying that unschoolers who  <br/>\ndon&#39;t control their children and overly permissive. Is that what you  <br/>\nwere saying? If so then that isn&#39;t what we do or how we live.  <br/>\nUnschooling may look like that to people who don&#39;t understand but that  <br/>\nis simply not true. It takes a lot of energy to remain mindful,  <br/>\nespecially when your triggers from a mainstream upbringing are being  <br/>\npushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you sit yourself down and figure out what is really bothering you  <br/>\nabout the sugar issue? What is the worse that can happen? What are you  <br/>\nseeing and feeling when your son eats straight sugar?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL loves to tell the story of her youngest child. MIL didn&#39;t allow  <br/>\nsugar, pretty much at all. She kept a small bit for coffee and special  <br/>\nbaking. This worked ok for the older two that had little interest in  <br/>\nsweet foods. Along came the baby. She loved sweet things. She wanted  <br/>\nsugar. She would sneak into the cupboard and eat straight sugar  <br/>\nbecause besides fruit that was all that was available. They think this  <br/>\nis cute and funny. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t ever want my kids to feel like  <br/>\nthey need to sneak to get their needs met. If they want sweets we will  <br/>\nproblem solve to met their needs. It seems by your words that you are  <br/>\nsetting up a power struggle. You son can ignore his needs and give up  <br/>\nhis power to you, he could sneak and learn that he needs to be  <br/>\ndishonest to get his needs met, he could feel bad about his needs, I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think any of us want our kids to feel this way. Especially when  <br/>\nthere are other ways to solve the issue. The issue is your fear, I  <br/>\nneed not involve your child at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk kids awake.

Yours are important too.&gt;&gt; <br/>\n2 \tlax , slack <br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\tlacking in rigor or strictness; &quot;such lax and slipshod ways are no longer acceptable&quot;; &quot;lax in attending classes&quot;; &quot;slack in maintaining discipline&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t3 \tindulgent , lax , lenient , soft <br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\ttolerant or lenient; &quot;indulgent parents risk spoiling their children&quot;; &quot;procedures are lax and discipline is weak&quot;; &quot;too soft on the children&quot; <br/>\nDo you really want to label unschooling and unschoolers this way? <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course our needs are important too. BUT! but but but..the children are little, they are new, they have NO CLUE how to navigate our world and society and relationships. So sometimes, their needs come before ours. <br/>\nFor example: <br/>\nI need a nap. (although I just got up &lt;g&gt;) I could just inform my kids that I have needs also and I am going upstairs and it&#39;s MY TURN!! Things go a lot more smoothly if I say, &quot;I&#39;m exhausted, I really need to take a nap. Can I get you anything to eat or drink before I head up? Do you want to watch a movie? What can i help you with? &quot; <br/>\nSo yes, in my opinion, their needs come first. I can wait, I&#39;m a big girl. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;We have so far always come to a consensus with the exception of ds wanting to eat sugar straight from the bowl. I just got rid of the sugar.&gt;&gt; <br/>\nOMG, what do you put in your coffee?!?!? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what would have happened if you had let him eat sugar straight from the sugar bowl? Would he have started bouncing like a big rubber kid-ball against the walls and ceilings and eventually right out the window? (Think cartoons) Would he have immediately had all his teeth fall out onto the ground? Would have have gotten morbidly obese very suddenly like Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor? <br/>\nCourse not. Have you ever tried eating sugar straight from the bowl? To me it feels very strange, like a mouthful of sand but then all your salivary glands kick in and it turns to really wet sand. It&#39;s not swallowable and you cant chew it so you just have to sit there and wait for it to melt. It&#39;s pretty weird. So my guess is that a kid would try that a few times and then realize that it probably is better to eat sugar when it is IN something, like Ice cream or chocolate or skittles or cinnamon toast or my favorite, Coffee! <br/>\nOoh, I had an idea, if he really wants to eat sugar out of the bowl, give him some strawberries! Let him dip away! (Maybe give him his own sugar bowl so there aren&#39;t any crunchy pieces in the main one.) <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;i know that alot of people on unschooling basics choose a much more lax style but this is what works for us and allows us to all be together and meet Everyones needs. &gt;&gt; <br/>\nYa know, I think that it is great that this works for you. Anyone who wants to &quot;tweak&quot; unschooling is more that welcome. But I don&#39;t think that many people are coming to unschooling basics to learn about unschooling lite, or unschooling academics only or unschooling tweaked. I can go to any of a dozen low volume low member lists to get that. I come here for the basics of unschooling. So that&#39;s why I felt the need to respond to this poster, because I can go out my front door to find out how to take care of MY needs or hide the sugar bowl. I come here for alternatives. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa, Unschooling Momma to Emily 15, and Max 9.

I have final say in health or safety matters. we will talk the issue whatever all the way through but in the end it is my choice. We have so far always come to a consensus with the exception of ds wanting to eat sugar straight from the bowl. I just got rid of the sugar. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Everyone must be respectful of others or take themselves out of the group. In the beginning I had to assist with the leaving a few times. But I just went with the struggling child and spent one on one time with them while talking about how its always easier to get <br/>\nour private time needs met when we use our words and ask for it instead of doing something angry, mean or hurtful to someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my &quot;tweaks&quot; on the unschooling lifestyle and so far so good. i know that alot of people on unschooling basics choose a much more lax style but this is what works for us and allows us to all be together and meet Everyones needs. Yours are important too. <br/>\n<br/>\nRala <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 5/14/09, jennifercroce37 &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a> &gt; wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a> &gt; <br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances? <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 14, 2009, 8:54 AM <br/>\n<br/>\nHi, <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been doing a lot of research on unschooling and hope to transform our lifestyle and parenting to this philosophy. I am finding it very challenging due to being stuck in conventional parenting traps and family circumstances. I would appreciate constructive input and suggestions. Here is a brief explanation of my family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two girls, they will be 7 and 3 in August. Like most siblings they are very different in regards to temperament and interests. My husband is in the process of establishing his own accounting practice and is a major workaholic so I am more or less a single parent most of the time due to his work schedule. I also run a home daycare 4 days a week. This has been a tremendous help for me in regards to personal growth and financial support. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying very hard to say yes more often to my childrens&#39; requests and letting go of my own needs and recognizing their&#39;s more often. I am also trying to look at everything as a choice rather than a need to get something done or accomplish something. I am trying to see the joy in spending more time with my children and really being with them than just around them. I truly want to embrace the unschooling lifestyle, but I have to be honest it is really, really difficult for me. I am seeing an increase in anger, tantrums and rudeness from my children when I try to be more open to letting them do and explore the things that interest them. I have a very difficult time accommodating both their needs/interests sinced they often conflict and I am often alone with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am registered for the NE unschooling conference in August and have read Rue Kream&#39;s book and am planning to read Dayna Martin&#39;s book when it is published. I think the hardest thing for me is doing this alone and not having adequate time to recover from the stress of day to day life. I am beginning to think a true unschooling lifestyle isn&#39;t possible for my family and am ready to throw in the towel. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <br/>\n<br/>\nJen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10161,"nextTopicId":40052}}
