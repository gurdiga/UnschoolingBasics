When he finished, he looked at <br/>\nme and said, &quot;THAT&#39;s how I handle my brother.&quot; I wish he&#39;d show his <br/>\nparents how to Ohmmmmmmm. :-&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a cool kid! That&#39;s awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sitting here exhausted...we spent all day on the go. The main <br/>\nactivity was <br/>\ntie dying at a friends house and swimming.<br/>\nJalen was SO damn cute, all serious with the dye and so proud of his <br/>\nnew shirt. <br/>\nHe&#39;s been wearing it since we pulled it out of the dryer tonight, <br/>\nAND today is <br/>\nthe first day he wore underwear all day (decided to poop and pee in <br/>\nthe toilet <br/>\nfor the first time this week, seems potty &quot;training&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessary:).<br/>\nSo after a really hard week with him, he&#39;s had this glorious day, <br/>\nand I&#39;m <br/>\nwondering why on earth I think he&#39;s so intense. <br/>\nSierra and he are playing with some pvc pipes (they&#39;ve been used to <br/>\nbuild forts <br/>\nand water channels this week) talking to each other through <br/>\nthem...she just said <br/>\n&quot;I love you Jalen&quot; really sweet.<br/>\nsigh. I just love these moments.<br/>\nThe tent is set up in the living room for a second night of &quot;camping <br/>\nout&quot; and everyone&#39;s bellies are full of sugar and cinnamon tortillas <br/>\nwe <br/>\ncooked a while ago.<br/>\nIt was a good day. And we&#39;re all colorful in our tie dye.<br/>\n<br/>\nOooooohhhhhhmmmmmmmm......:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":754,"nextTopicId":756}}
