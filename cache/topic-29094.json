We are a school by name, but our <br/>\nvision is one of seeking relationship directly &#8211; by living it, not <br/>\nthrough a teacher, book or class.  We are also home to a growing <br/>\nchildren&#39;s culture and are passionate about providing the best <br/>\npossible environment whereby children can discover themselves and in <br/>\nthe process share with us their gifts so vital to our own journeys <br/>\nof self-discovery.  To this end we are seeking more children and <br/>\nparents who would live to explore living as part of our circle and a <br/>\nwebpage <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html\">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html</a> <br/>\nchronicling our vision of relationship (with children and <br/>\notherwise.)  As of now the page is still being woven together and is <br/>\ncrafted together with stories, pictures and quotes of our lives <br/>\nhere, with more to come.  To find out more about the school or to <br/>\nschedule a visit e-mail <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:balance@...\">balance@...</a>, or for more <br/>\nchildren&#39;s culture specific information, email me directly @ <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marcus@...\">marcus@...</a><br/>\nIn gratitude for your own journeys,<br/>\n-Marcus<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Let us put our heads together and see what life we will make for <br/>\nour children.&quot;- Tatanka lotanka (Sitting Bull)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more personal note...<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your being open to hosting my intro here. I&#39;m <br/>\ncanvassing a lot of unschooling/natural parenting forums in an <br/>\nattempt to get the word out about Teaching Drum. By &quot;children&#39;s <br/>\nculture&quot; I mean a group of children with their own culture. This <br/>\nhappens wherever there are groups of children - they have their own <br/>\ngames, language, conflict-resolution techniques, ect. We are <br/>\nintentionally trying to foster this, and the difference between <br/>\nsaying &quot;we just want more kids&quot; is that we know it&#39;s what our <br/>\nchildren need. In school and in sports they are clustered into peer <br/>\ngroups where they learn they need to compete for <br/>\nattention/acceptance. But humans weren&#39;t evolved to learn this way. <br/>\nIn the small clans where we evolved our natural learning styles <br/>\nchildren would spend their days with those older and younger than <br/>\nthem, following in the example of the older and providing a bridge <br/>\nfor the younger. Right now our school community (by the way - <br/>\nthe &quot;school&quot; is quite unique, I might call it the most radical <br/>\nfacilitated-unschooling experience for adults that exists on this <br/>\nplanet) is home to 3 children. Already in their day-to-day play I <br/>\ncan see how much more tuned in to each other they are (the 5 year <br/>\nold wants to learn much more from the 6 year old than from any of <br/>\nthe adults). Right now there are big gaps 2years-&gt;5 years-&gt;6 <br/>\nyears-&gt;21 years. Filling in those gaps is key for the children&#39;s own <br/>\nfulfillment (having someone to guide and put their new learning to <br/>\npractice, and having guides of their own) and for the maturation of <br/>\nthe community (for our future and because relationship with children <br/>\nbrings us so much of our own learning and example). The website I&#39;ve <br/>\ncreated goes into these concepts more, I encourage anyone curious to <br/>\ncheck it out (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)\">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.htm)</a>, or <br/>\nto email me if you have any more questions @ <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cybrmarc21@...\">cybrmarc21@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29069,"nextTopicId":29056}}
