No, there was no threat <br/>\nof taking it away as at that point and time, I was totally bought in <br/>\nto the unschooling-means-no-limits point of view.

Why can I have a beer after dinner <br/>\nand not want another one, while my good friend can never touch a beer <br/>\nwithout wanting 20? Why can some people self-regulate with food or <br/>\nalcohol or tobacco or books or chatrooms or pornography and some <br/>\npeople can&#39;t?? If you could answer that question, you could make a <br/>\nbillion bucks, I&#39;d bet.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I know never to take a good fast-paced book to bed with me <br/>\nunless I want to be tired and grumpy the next day because my brain <br/>\ncan&#39;t stop reading until I&#39;ve finished it.

The <br/>\narticle referenced Singapore, which has had an explosive growth in <br/>\nmyopia, and also mentioned that the U.S. is on the same curve as <br/>\nSingapore, but a few years behind. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust googling myopia and Singapore brought up:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.snec.com.sg/ecp/childhood_myopia.asp\">http://www.snec.com.sg/ecp/childhood_myopia.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA quote from that site: &quot;Myopia is a rapidly worsening public health <br/>\nproblem in Singapore. Surveys have indicated that myopia afflicts 25% <br/>\nof 7 year olds, 33% of 9 year olds, 50% of 12 year olds and more than <br/>\n80% of 18 year old males in Singapore. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A myopic person looking at a computer screen too long, to you, is <br/>\n&gt; tantamount to having a stick poked in one&#39;s eye?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, but both are behaviors that could, possibly, lead to blindness. <br/>\nOne in the very immediate short term - with a poke. One in the very <br/>\nslow long-term. If 80% of males are at risk for myopia by the time <br/>\nthey reach 18, and myopia is incurable and can lead to blindness, <br/>\nthen yes the risk is there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you feel that without computers your child would not have had <br/>\n </span></blockquote>eye <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; problems that needed addressing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel that the screen time exacerbated and accelerated an already-<br/>\nexisting problem. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I *would* have had to &quot;deal&quot; with it if I had chosen to see it in a <br/>\n&gt; negative light.

I wrestled in my mind with exactly what you&#39;re talking <br/>\n&gt; about, tried to observe my son clearly and without judgement, and <br/>\n&gt; decided to wait and trust.  I&#39;m glad I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And I too waited and trusted, and the outcome was different for me <br/>\nand my kid. I wonder why you have such a hard time believing that <br/>\npeople are different? After all, a good friend of mine is a walking <br/>\ntwig, yet can eat anything she wants to. If we go out to dinner, she <br/>\norders two entrees to my one. Yet she doesn&#39;t gain a pound. I think <br/>\nit would be a bit ludicrous of her to tell me that because she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t gain any weight that I could eat exactly as she does and be <br/>\nequally skinny. She has a different body, different metabolism, etc. <br/>\nthan I do. What works for her doesn&#39;t work for me and vice versa. So <br/>\nwhile she eats her two entrees, I eat 75% of mine and run 8 miles the <br/>\nnext day and still outweigh her by 30 pounds. Oh well, that is just <br/>\nthe way life is. I&#39;m glad that your kids don&#39;t have a problem <br/>\ndisengaging from the screen, just like I&#39;m glad my friend can eat her <br/>\ndouble cheesecake and not gain an ounce.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a &quot;party line,&quot; I think there is careful <br/>\n&gt; examination of ideas and opinions- which is a good thing.

I didn&#39;t sneak around, wasn&#39;t interested in <br/>\nwatching it at friend&#39;s houses, and didn&#39;t become a television junky <br/>\nthe second I moved out of the house. I didn&#39;t own a TV for years as <br/>\nan adult, though I do now and do enjoy watching some shows. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink TV is inherently evil, but I also don&#39;t resent my parents&#39; <br/>\nviews or their limits on it either. &lt;shrug&gt;  I could just as easily <br/>\nsay &quot;It is an unintended but very very predictable side effect of few <br/>\nrules and limits that children become unruly, wild, and unmanageable <br/>\nand that the relationship between parents and kids becomes strained.&quot; <br/>\nNow that&#39;s not any more true than what you said, but I have seen it <br/>\nhappen in a couple of families. The fact is, that family dynamics are <br/>\nway more complicated than these simplistic predictions. I love and <br/>\nrespect my kids, they love and respect me. I try not to make too many <br/>\narbitrary rules or limits, they do understand and respect the ones I <br/>\ndo make. So far, it&#39;s working well. If it starts to not work well, <br/>\nwe&#39;ll think about, adjust, and change. And the predictions of doom <br/>\nand gloom due to one limit in their life, I guess I&#39;m just not too <br/>\nworried about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: video watching advice","postDate":"1103225307","msgId":4333,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjE2MTkyODI3LjI3MjIyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNwc211NitrNDJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4332,"nextInTopic":4334,"prevInTime":4332,"nextInTime":4334,"topicId":4290,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But it is also about freedom <br/>\n  and responsibility.  My 14 yo and my 5yo don&#39;t have the same amount <br/>\n  of freedoms due to their differences in reasoning abilities.  If my <br/>\n  14yo wanted to disappear for the day with people I didn&#39;t really <br/>\n  know that well, I would make sure she had her cell phone and <br/>\n  wouldn&#39;t worry.  If my 5yo wanted to do that, I would either be <br/>\n  accompanying them or it wouldn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would your 5yo *want* to disappear for the day with people she <br/>\n  didn&#39;t know very well?  My 5yo wouldn&#39;t, nor would my previous 2 <br/>\n  5yos.  But, for the sake of the argument, if a 5yo somehow spent <br/>\n  enough time with a group of people (that Mom didn&#39;t know very well) <br/>\n  to desire to disappear with them for a day I think that&#39;s a very <br/>\n  different situation from a child watching a lot of self-chosen <br/>\n  video.  It&#39;s not even in the same ballpark to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; I think sometimes we forget this.  What is an &quot;obsession&quot; with <br/>\n  some people is just something they like to do a lot.  They have <br/>\n  other interests, they have friends, they see sunlight <br/>\n  occassionally.  For others, an &quot;obsession&quot; blocks out anything and <br/>\n  everything else.  The difference between &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; <br/>\n  and &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would your 5yo *want* to disappear for the day with people she <br/>\n  didn&#39;t know very well?  Someone who doesn&#39;t have any friends at <br/>\n  all, someone who never sees sunlight, someone who doesn&#39;t willingly <br/>\n  eat or sleep?  I don&#39;t.<br/>\n  IME that description is only used in a sarcastic/demeaning way and <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t at all hold up to reality.<br/>\n  I&#39;m speaking generally, not personally- mabye you do know someone <br/>\n  like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; So I think all parents limit their children somewhat based on <br/>\n  their fears (of the effects of pornography, the effects of white <br/>\n  sugar, the effects of running into the street without looking, the <br/>\n  possibility of kidnappers, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  True, but many fears are irrational, fearful and based on <br/>\n  misinformation.  I think it&#39;s more important to really look at <br/>\n  the &quot;why&quot; of our fears with an open mind than to control our <br/>\n  children in order to passify such fears.<br/>\n  Running into the street without looking is an obvious enough one, <br/>\n  but are we talking about toddlers?  An older child?  Do we not let <br/>\n  an older child near the road because of an irrational fear of <br/>\n  traffic?  This is something I need to work on- trusting my 11yo to <br/>\n  ride his bike further and further from home for example.  I think <br/>\n  there&#39;s a fine line between rational (cars can be deadly and we need <br/>\n  to help our children stay safe) and irrational (&quot;I know! I just <br/>\n  won&#39;t let him out of the house until he&#39;s 18!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; This year she chose to go to Kindergarten.  Being an unschooling <br/>\n  mom, I supported that decision.  99% of the food in the cafeteria <br/>\n  contains soy.  Michelle wants to eat in the cafeteria because she <br/>\n  doesn&#39;t remember the reactions.  I said ok because she hadn&#39;t had a <br/>\n  reaction in several years and the rashes started.  So she is back to <br/>\n  taking her lunch.  She isn&#39;t happy because she doesn&#39;t have the info <br/>\n  that I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Is a rash as far as the reaction would go at this point?  I thought <br/>\n  a fatal reaction to a food was pretty much immediate.  My cousin&#39;s <br/>\n  4yo has a life threatening peanut allergy and she literally cannot <br/>\n  be near them- it&#39;s not an option to give it a try and see if she <br/>\n  gets a rash.<br/>\n  On the other hand, I have a friend whose 5yo breaks out in eczema <br/>\n  whenever he eats dairy, mostly on his wrists and ankles.  He <br/>\n  scratches like crazy when he has it.  But since she knows that&#39;s as <br/>\n  far as the reaction will go she lets him choose whether eating pizza <br/>\n  at a birthday party or ice cream with his older siblings is worth <br/>\n  the temporary rash.<br/>\n  If I were you and it was that important to my daughter to be able to <br/>\n  eat with her friends, the first thing I would probably do is talk to <br/>\n  whoever is in charge of the cafetaria food and come up with some <br/>\n  other options for her.  If you can get soy free foods for your home, <br/>\n  surely they can have some available in the cafeteria, no?<br/>\n  Is it the kind of cafeteria that changes the menu daily?  Mabye you <br/>\n  could go over the ingredients with the staff and your daughter and <br/>\n  come up with specific cafeteria days and brown bag it the others.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Patti<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I&#39;m not going to just say, &quot;no limits - she can do what she <br/>\nwants,&quot; to myself. I&#39;m going to think, &quot;What is going on with her that <br/>\nshe&#39;s doing this?&quot; I&#39;m not going to jump from &quot;She&#39;s watching 16 hours <br/>\nper day of television&quot; to &quot;You&#39;re limited to two hours per day.&quot; There <br/>\nare a LOT of other alternatives that don&#39;t involve ME imposing <br/>\narbitrary limits - and it IS arbitrary. Why two hours? Why not 1 hour? <br/>\nWhy not 2 hours today and 3 tomorrow and 1 the next day? Any time <br/>\nlimits set like that are just something the parent came up with - <br/>\narbitrarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I notice that one of my kids gets really grouchy and cranky after <br/>\nwatching hours of tv, I&#39;ll be responsive to that, but NOT by setting <br/>\narbitrary limits. If I notice that one of my kids gets &quot;hooked&quot; on <br/>\nwatching tv and doesn&#39;t seem to quite have the ability to turn it off <br/>\neven though I think that if she did, she&#39;d have more fun doing <br/>\nsomething else, then I&#39;ll be responsive to THAT, too. But not with <br/>\narbitrary rules and limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other options. I&#39;m more capable than that - I can do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I do is inside my OWN head - I ask myself what I think <br/>\nis going on, what I&#39;m worried about, how reasonable is my fear and all <br/>\nthat (as Julie described). AND I ask myself whether I&#39;m giving my child <br/>\nenough credit - have I given her time or am I ready to &quot;do something&quot; <br/>\nbased on a few days or even just a few weeks of behavior - I try to <br/>\ntalk myself into being more patient (because i&#39;m a &#39;do something&#39; kind <br/>\nof person). I try to think about why she&#39;s doing what she&#39;s doing - try <br/>\nto think about it from her perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes what I come up with is that I was just about to interrupt <br/>\nsomething that is important for her --  the teenager watching <br/>\nNickelodeon 16 hours per day might be deeply deeply thinking about her <br/>\nfuture, might be scared and confused and needing a TON of internal time <br/>\n- sitting in front of non-demanding tv is a way to be &#39;doing something&#39; <br/>\nwhile our brains can process other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe I come up with the possibility that she&#39;s depressed and <br/>\navoiding life and I need to figure out how to approach that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many possibilities - if I just say to myself, &quot;She&#39;s <br/>\nwatching TOO much tv, it isn&#39;t good for her, I&#39;m going to limit her to <br/>\n2 hours per day,&quot; then I&#39;ve really missed the boat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been times when I felt like one of my kids was being too <br/>\nsedentary and spending too much time on the computer or watching tv <br/>\nthan was good for them, physically. I certainly know THIS problem - I <br/>\nhave the same tendency, myself.  But, the solution has never been to <br/>\nimpose arbitrary limits, but to entice them into some more physical <br/>\nendeavors that they LIKE.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeachers close the blinds in classrooms so the kids will pay attention <br/>\nto them. It would be better if the opened the windows and doors and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;You&#39;re not only free to look out, but free to go out.&quot; And then <br/>\nthe teachers would have to make what was happening in the classroom <br/>\nenticing enough to keep their attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen kids watch &quot;too much tv&quot; for the parents&#39; comfort level - for <br/>\nwhatever reasons (not arguing about whether those are legitimate or <br/>\nnot) - and if the parents have given thought to what all that time <br/>\nspent is meaning for the kid, etc., then I think parents at least ought <br/>\nto entice the kids away, not restrict them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom used to once in a while tell me to put down my book and go <br/>\noutside. She thought I read too much and it was going to be bad for my <br/>\neyes. I used to sneak a book out, under my shirt, and go find a hidden <br/>\nspot to sit and read out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nArbitrary rules and limits have the added characteristic that they <br/>\nentice kids to think about how they can get around them and can even <br/>\nentice kids to cheat and lie. I know a couple of really really great <br/>\nunschooled kids whose parents set limits on their computer use time. <br/>\nThe kids used to get up in the middle of the night to use the computer <br/>\nwhile their parents were asleep.

Which is why our kids have tons of great opportunities <br/>\navailable. Basically, they live in unschooler paradise, on a cul-de-<br/>\nsac with 6 unschooling kids, a large forested lot next door with a <br/>\nfort and a creek, a room full of Legos, and a great homeschooling <br/>\ngroup with lots of friends and activities. There&#39;s certainly plenty <br/>\nof good opportunities around for all kinds of fun. Most of the time, <br/>\nthis works pretty well and the kids get a good balance. But one of my <br/>\nkids has a hard time disengaging from any kind of screen, and given <br/>\nthe option he will always choose to stay connected, no matter how <br/>\nmuch he might want to do something else. That&#39;s where the limits come <br/>\nin, when he&#39;s been on long enough that it *is* affecting his eyes and <br/>\nwould affect his health. If both of my kids were like my other kid, <br/>\nwho has no problem disengaging, it just wouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It seems irrational to me to compare running in front of a car to <br/>\n&gt; spending a lot of time reading or watching videos.  One is <br/>\n&gt; immediately life threatening, and whether the others carry even a <br/>\n&gt; *slight* possibilty of harm is debatable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess that depends on your own opinion. To me, an epidemic of <br/>\nmyopia is not debatable. A situation where 80% of the population will <br/>\nhave a serious visual problem that is permanent and can lead to <br/>\nblindness is not a trivial thing to me. You might not believe that, I <br/>\ndo. So we operate from different beliefs and consequently make <br/>\ndifferent decisions. Presumably, your children don&#39;t already have eye <br/>\nproblems, mine does. So again, I make a different decision based both <br/>\non the information I have and the situation we&#39;re in. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to use an extreme example (like <br/>\n&gt; pulling a child out of the path of an oncoming car) as a <br/>\n&gt; justification for any and every other limit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, I agree. And I don&#39;t justify &quot;any and every other limit&quot;. But <br/>\nI do make a limit and a decision about one specific thing - eyes and <br/>\ncomputers - for one of my kids who already has serious eye problems. <br/>\nThat&#39;s a health and safety issue. Perhaps I should compare it to, <br/>\nsay, poking a stick at another child&#39;s eyes. That&#39;s another thing I <br/>\nwould limit as it could lead to blindness, pain, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Making a choice *for* them doesn&#39;t help them make *any* choice <br/>\n&gt; though.  If the ability to make good, safe decisions is the goal <br/>\n&gt; then the freedom to make choices would be the key, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In most circumstances, I&#39;d agree. And we did give that a try - I was <br/>\na believer in the no-limits unschooling philosophy, but it just <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work for my kid on this one issue. And $3000 of eye problems <br/>\nand some serious vision issues later, I&#39;m not willing to let him make <br/>\nthe decisions on this issue right now. Maybe sometime in the future <br/>\nhe will, just like with his food allergies, I had to make all the <br/>\ndecisions about what he ate when he was too young to understand the <br/>\nserious consequences of eating the wrong thing. Now he understands, <br/>\nso he controls what he eats. While he couldn&#39;t safely make those <br/>\ndecisions, I made them for him. Now he&#39;s learned how, he makes them <br/>\nfor himself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are these people that you spend all your time with?  I&#39;m wondering <br/>\n&gt; how you know that they have spent 12 hours a day, every day, for <br/>\n&gt; years, playing video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m close enough to them and to their parents to know. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Again, do you personally know former unschoolers who spent all of <br/>\n&gt; their waking hours playing video games and now, as adults, have <br/>\n&gt; serious problems connecting with other people?  What exactly do you <br/>\n&gt; mean by &quot;connecting&quot; problem?  Some people are naturally <br/>\n&gt; introverted, and it may be that those people are more drawn to <br/>\n&gt; computers, and for longer periods, than extroverts.  I think it <br/>\n&gt; would be easy for an extroverted person to assume that an introvert <br/>\n&gt; is lonely or unhappy but that may not be the case at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;d hope that even if my kid is an introvert that they would <br/>\nhave basic communications skills and an ability to interact with <br/>\nother humans in meaningful ways. That is what was missing in many of <br/>\nthe people I knew. Personally, I&#39;m an introvert and am pretty drawn <br/>\nto computers myself, or I wouldn&#39;t have ended up in the field. I <br/>\ncould happily spend hours a day plunked down here in my office at <br/>\nhome, but I try to limit my own screen time as well. I know it&#39;s not <br/>\nhealthy for my body, my eyes, my soul or my family if I spend all of <br/>\nmy time interacting online and not as much interacting with real <br/>\npeople.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Did these people grow up in an unschooling home?<br/>\n&gt; My oldest (11) has adored video games since he was 6 and we got our <br/>\n&gt; first playstation.  He has always played all he wants, which has <br/>\n&gt; ranged from not turning it on some days to playing, say, up to 6 or <br/>\n&gt; 7 hours in a day (a generous estimate and usually when he has a new <br/>\n&gt; game).  He doesn&#39;t like pizza, has plenty of friends, loves the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sun, <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and can&#39;t wait to drive a car.  He spends lots of time on the <br/>\n&gt; computer but certainly doesn&#39;t live there.<br/>\n&gt; I honestly can&#39;t think of anything he&#39;d want to do for 12 <br/>\n&gt; continuous, unbroken hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great. I know lots of well-balanced unschooling kids like <br/>\nthat. My daughter is like that as well. She loves computer games, but <br/>\nhas lots of other interests and can easily walk away. However, there <br/>\nare some kids who have a much harder time self-regulating and cannot <br/>\nso easily disengage from a computer. Sounds like your kid isn&#39;t one <br/>\nof them, which is great, you really haven&#39;t had to deal with this <br/>\nsituation. As a mom who has, who tried no-limits and found it just <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work, I&#39;m giving the original poster on this thread the <br/>\nbenefit of my experience as well as the benefit of others who have <br/>\ndifferent opinions. For some reason, when people post not to ever <br/>\nlimit, their personal choice doesn&#39;t come under fire. When people <br/>\npost anything about limits, it does. For us, limiting the screen time <br/>\nworks well. My kids are happy, engaged, and enjoy many activities, <br/>\nincluding (but not limited to) computers, video games, DVD&#39;s, etc. <br/>\nFor others, not limiting might work just as well. It certainly works <br/>\nfine with my daughter, it doesn&#39;t with my son. It&#39;s nice to hear more <br/>\nthan one party line when someone has a question along these lines, <br/>\nand that&#39;s why I occasionally do post with my experience. But every <br/>\ntime I do, I know it will be extensively questioned, which is a bit <br/>\nexhausting, so I don&#39;t do it very frequently. It&#39;s a bit too bad, <br/>\nreally, because then people only get to hear a certain subset of <br/>\nexperience, and others who might also have opinions to offer stay <br/>\nsilent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is our experience, it works well for us.

For one <br/>\nthing, because I know real life unschoolers who are not limited at <br/>\nall, and do play video games 12 hours a day and have for years. I <br/>\nthink the ability to self-limit is something that is more in-born <br/>\nthan some people assume.

There have been some things I couldn&#39;t trust my <br/>\nkids with, just for health and safety reasons. One of my kids had <br/>\nlife-threatening food allergies. When he was younger, I had to limit <br/>\nwhat he ate and watch everything like a hawk. Now that he&#39;s older, he <br/>\ncan do that for himself and understands it more. Interestingly, and <br/>\ncounter to the prevailing unschooling mantra, even though he was so <br/>\nseriously limited on food as a young child, he has no issues with <br/>\neating, food, control, etc. I don&#39;t think having a limit, for a <br/>\nhealth reason, guarantees some horrifying future problems down the <br/>\nline. I also insist on things like seatbelts and bike helmets, even <br/>\nif the kids don&#39;t like them, even if they might not fully understand <br/>\nthe reasons for them yet. It&#39;s my job as a parent to be concerned <br/>\nabout their health and safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I try to give the kids as much freedom to decide as I <br/>\npossibly can. With the exception of health and safety, they follow <br/>\ntheir own heart&#39;s desires. And again, just because they have a limit <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re severely deprived or anything.

Perhaps we should look instead at the basis of our fears.  Is it a few medical studies?  Is it that we know it runs in our family?  Is it that we have had direct experience with it ourselves?  Is it having a measurable bad effect on our child and how are we defining &quot;bad effect&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nThen if we still have concerns...Do we have to limit or can we simply be sure to offer other choices?  Will our child listen to our fears and heed them?  Do we really have to say &quot;No, you can&#39;t&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter is 5 and chose to go to school this year.  When she was a baby she had a life threatening reaction to soy (which we all know is in pretty much everything).  She has had several reactions to it when it was ingested accidentally that required a rush to the emergency room.  It all happened when she was very small and she doesn&#39;t remember anything but a rash she would also sometimes get.  We have severely limited her soy intake since infancy by only purchasing foods that didn&#39;t have soy.  She didn&#39;t even know about it I don&#39;t think because it was just the way things were.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year she chose to go to Kindergarten.  Being an unschooling mom, I supported that decision.  99% of the food in the cafeteria contains soy.  Michelle wants to eat in the cafeteria because she doesn&#39;t remember the reactions.  I said ok because she hadn&#39;t had a reaction in several years and the rashes started.  So she is back to taking her lunch.  She isn&#39;t happy because she doesn&#39;t have the info that I do.  She simply doesn&#39;t remember.  I am not willing to risk a serious reaction while she is at school, away from me for 8 hours.  I have done my best to explain the situation to Michelle, but she is 5yo and would still prefer to eat cafeteria food like her friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all parents draw that line different places.  I think we need to look at where we draw the line to see if our concerns are based in reality or are we being manipulated by the media, other parents, whatever.  I know for myself, I am always looking for ways to move the line towards more freedom for the kids but for now it is absolutely drawn at the point where harm is being or has been actually caused to themselves, to others or to property.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, December 15, 2004 11:46 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] video watching advice<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Therefore, we <br/>\n  limit the screen time to a modest amount per day and we&#39;ve discussed <br/>\n  the reasoning with him - that we&#39;re balancing permament problems with <br/>\n  his eyes and his wishes to be on the computer/video games.

If a child wants to read more than another child, should that be limited?<br/>\nIf one child needs an intense amount of music and another does not, should we limit that?<br/>\nMy oldest ds was just telling me tonight about a man that played over 12 hours of video games a day (I bet he was limited as a child!!)<br/>\nand is now a game producer making BIG bucks.

What I&#39;ve read has been compelling enough that I believe the link is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some research suggests genetic factors are the main cause of myopia. <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/myokid.htm.\">http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/myokid.htm.</a>       Myopia *did* seem<br/>\n&gt; to be higher in kids who read a lot, though.   Maybe one day they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; discover that myopic kids chose reading and close paper work kinds of<br/>\n&gt; activities because those were the easiest activities for their visual<br/>\n&gt; abilities.  Who knows? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the causation goes that direction. For instance, studies among Inuits showed that myopia mostly occurred once reading had been introduced. In the pre-literate populations, it only rarely occured. Among Inuits who had been taught how to read, it occurred with a hugely greater frequency. (&quot;Inuit myopia: an environmentally induced &quot;epidemic&quot;? R. W. Morgan, J. S. Speakman and S. E. Grimshaw ) So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that people who are myopic prefer to read, but that too much close-work (reading, computer, video, or even something like knitting, presumably) can induce myopia by causing the eye to change its shape.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So here we are.  I had a child, on purpose, even though I know my vision<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t great.  My husband has several relatives who are alcoholics, and I<br/>\n&gt; knew that before we had Dylan.  I knew he might inherit my bad teeth.  I<br/>\n&gt; knew my grandmother died from Alzheimer&#39;s disease.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, my kids inherited my bad teeth as well, and that&#39;s why we have them brush them twice daily. Another preventative health measure that I feel is important.  And my mom&#39;s mother died of Alzheimer&#39;s and that&#39;s why my mom is taking fish oil supplements and a daily aspirin and all of this other stuff that&#39;s supposed to forestall it. My DH&#39;s dad died of a heart attack at 42, and so he&#39;s religious about watching his cholesterol, eating habits, and exercise. There&#39;s not much we can do about the hand that was dealt us, except to play it wisely. With our son, who already has vision problems, it makes sense to work to protect his vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know people die in car accidents but I still strapped my baby in a car<br/>\n&gt; when I wanted to go somewhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, but you did strap him in, presumably because children who aren&#39;t strapped in are much more likely to be injured or killed. I know that as a kid, I constantly rode around in a car with no seatbelts, but now that I have more information and better child seats/harnesses/seat belts at my disposal, I buckle my kids in. Another health measure that I feel is important. Now there have been plenty of times (esp. when they were younger) when they really didn&#39;t like being strapped in, but it&#39;s just not optional for health/safety reasons to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I could have said no, or limited running, swinging, playing on the slide,<br/>\n&gt; riding a bike, climbing trees, swimming, hiking, trampoline.  Some kids<br/>\n&gt; get bitten by dogs but we have two. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids do all that stuff as well, with proper precautions. They don&#39;t run on broken glass in bare feet, play with strange, snarling dogs, or ride bikes without helmets. They also love to play computer games, video games, or watch movies. They do this with the health precaution of not having too much screen time and not too much at one sitting, the same way that they ride bikes with helmets on, because I care about the health and welfare of their growing  bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Knowing genetics plays the largest roll in myopia I&#39;d limit the course of<br/>\n&gt; action I&#39;d let my own fear take and not put a limit on my son&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; cartooning or painting or reading or game play. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From my own research, I don&#39;t personally believe that genetics plays the largest role in myopia any longer. For instance, in some places like Singapore, myopia now afflicts 80% of the 18 year old males. In just 3 generations, it&#39;s gone from being relatively rare to almost all of the population. I don&#39;t see how genetics would explain that. Studies I&#39;ve seen have shown that we&#39;re on the same curve as Singapore, just a few years behind. Within a generation, almost all of our children will be myopic if the trend towards close-viewing continues. And since myopia is irreversible (at least with current medical care) and can lead to blindness, I, personally, would like to have my children avoid being affected. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year we spent $3000 on our son&#39;s eyes (yikes!) and I respect and trust his eye doctor. Her recommendation was to limit screen time and to provide ample breaks, and also to provide plenty of outdoor long-vision activities. I think it&#39;s a good recommendation for him and for our situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I don&#39;t see any huge benefit in unlimited screen time, at least not a huge enough benefit to offset the health issues that I feel are there. I know unschooled kids who have unlimited screen time and some of them are pretty well-balanced, and some of them live on their gaming system/screen and never come out of the house. None of them seem any happier/better adjusted/etc. than my kids. My kids know the reasons that we have for limiting screen time, and they understand them even if they don&#39;t always agree. They&#39;ve got lots of other stuff to do around here, and they do get plenty of time to watch movies or play games. My son played about an hour&#39;s worth this morning, then we went to gymnastics and the park, and now as soon as I get off the computer they&#39;re going to watch a Pokemon movie, they&#39;re hardly deprived :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also limit my own screen time, as I can feel it affecting my eyes if I&#39;m on too long. The kids know that this is just a health principle that we all follow, just like we buckle our seatbelts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nRadmama to Mackenzie (8/28/96) and Asa (10/5/99)  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: video watching advice","postDate":"1103120672","msgId":4307,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjE1LjA3MjQzMi4yMTg4LjAuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":4306,"nextInTopic":4309,"prevInTime":4306,"nextInTime":4308,"topicId":4290,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Myopia among  children is skyrocketing due to video/computer screen use (in some places it has doubled or triped in the last 10 years.) *** Some studies","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1778911620\">***Myopia among  children is skyrocketing due to video/computer screen<br/>\nuse (in some <br/>\nplaces it has doubled or triped in the last 10 years.) ***<br/>\n<br/>\nSome studies found no link between video game/TV viewing and myopia.  <br/>\nSome research suggests genetic factors are the main cause of myopia. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/myokid.htm.\">http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/myokid.htm.</a>       Myopia *did* seem<br/>\nto be higher in kids who read a lot, though.

Myopia among <br/>\nchildren is skyrocketing due to video/computer screen use (in some <br/>\nplaces it has doubled or triped in the last 10 years.) When <br/>\nchildren&#39;s eyes focus on a near object, such as a book, compueter <br/>\nscreen, or video for prolonged periods of time, in some children <br/>\ntheir eyes will grown longer to accomodate the focusing, causing <br/>\npermanent myopia.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also encourage the kids to take &quot;vision breaks&quot; when they&#39;re on <br/>\nthe computer or video games, and also encourage them to do activities <br/>\nsuch as outdoor play that also lets their eyes focus on distant <br/>\nobjects as well as near ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to whether or not he will &quot;get it out of his system&quot;, I think that <br/>\ndepends on the child and their personality. I have one kid who will <br/>\nwalk away from the screen and go and do other things, and one kid who <br/>\nwill be forever mesmerized by any kind of screen activity. And I know <br/>\nkids who, literally, have spent years where they&#39;re on a video screen <br/>\nor computer game 8 - 10 hours a day and haven&#39;t grown out of it. So I <br/>\nthink it is highly individual. I guess the question is, do you think <br/>\nit&#39;s a problem for your child? With my child who has a hard time <br/>\ndisengaging from screens, he also has vision problems. Therefore, we <br/>\nlimit the screen time to a modest amount per day and we&#39;ve discussed <br/>\nthe reasoning with him - that we&#39;re balancing permament problems with <br/>\nhis eyes and his wishes to be on the computer/video games.
