What an amazing gift for all of us to<br/>\nthink about and discuss.<br/>\nI also think that it would be helpful to address it with the child<br/>\nas a mistake that may have happened on the computer as the 14 yr old had <br/>\ntold<br/>\nhis mom so there could be open discussion about it. I once went to<br/>\nwhat I thought was a library site but it was .com vs .org and got a porn <br/>\nsite<br/>\nand I was so frazzled.<br/>\nI recently picked up the book called Boy Talk and opened it to<br/>\na page that discussed boys and pornography.  It was addressing<br/>\nthe issue of boys being exposed to pornography early in their lives and <br/>\nnot understanding<br/>\nwhat was going on in their bodies as a response to this and that this <br/>\nexperience<br/>\ncould be a jump off for them<br/>\nof how they address their sexuality now and in the future. <br/>\n<br/>\nA group of us just got together to discuss the new emerging changes<br/>\nwith our kids specific to sexuality.  I appreciate the replies to the posts<br/>\nthus far as I am continuing to ponder these ideas as my son is growing to<br/>\nthe teen years.. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28165,"nextTopicId":28276}}
