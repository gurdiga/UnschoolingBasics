Have you tried the NewEnglandUnschooling yahoo group? A fewof our local homeschool friends  have gone the unschooling route, others are more &#39;school at home&#39;.  We still enjoy seeing  all of our homeschooling friends (even the ones who are not unschooling)  for playtime and some fun trips to the museum or the beach or bowling, etc.,  It used to feel a little awkward to be in a group setting where some of the homeschooling moms would discuss their &#39;teaching methods&#39; or curriculum etc.,   although as the years go by I am much more confident in our unschooling so I am less bothered ..... Actually I used to feel awkward because I felt the &#39;school at homers&#39; would think me negligent for not formally instructing my children or &#39;doing school&#39; in some way. Now I feel awkard because it is sometimes tough to bite my tongue and be respectful of others&#39; choices to home educate  in a &#39;sch<br/>\nool at home &#39; fashion knowing how wonderful unschooling is.... LOL!  .
