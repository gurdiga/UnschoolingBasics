I have<br/>\nseen a few coments from the ladies here that suggest that this is<br/>\nsomething that you all may deal with at one time or another.<br/>\nMy husband and I get along very well, most of the time. The only<br/>\nissue we seem to have is about the children. He says things to the<br/>\nchildren that are sometimes hurtful (I feel).<br/>\nDo you all comment on it at all? Do you all just let it be?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDepends on the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done it all from screaming like a banshee to letting him &quot;work it <br/>\nthrough&quot; to discussing it afterwards to discussing it at the time to <br/>\ntelling him I will walk and take the kids with me to <br/>\n...well...everything!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had many discussions and sometimes arguements. Ok, a lot of<br/>\narguements. I seem to go into a protective mode which puts us at<br/>\nodds. I am starting to think that maybe I need to relax a little and<br/>\njust let it go. It seems to happen most with our 8 year old dd. She<br/>\nis a bundle of energy and chatters almost nonstop. This drives him<br/>\nnuts. He will sometimes make a nasty comment to her and hurt her<br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also make very nasty comments to him about his nasty comments and <br/>\nhurt him very much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, it was after he understood that it&#39;s not about *him*---it&#39;s <br/>\nabout the *children*!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot obout healing ourselves by being the parent we wish that <br/>\nwe had had. I try to use my own examples with my own parents. Then Ben <br/>\nstarted to give me some of his own examples. We talked about how our <br/>\nparents made us feel. AFter a while, I could just give him a &quot;look&quot; <br/>\nthat would stop him from going off any further.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow he does that for *me* sometimes! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI start to worry about her self esteem and how she will<br/>\nexpected to be treated by the men in her life when she gets older. I<br/>\nhave been friends with several women who did not have good<br/>\nrelationships with thier fathers and all of them have chosen bums to<br/>\nshare thier lives with. Am I over analyzing here? Am I being<br/>\noverprotective? Could it be that because of the way I am reacting<br/>\nthat *I* may be standing in the way of them having a better<br/>\nrelationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut who else will stand up for your child?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, he grew up in a very abusive and controlling home<br/>\nand is doing 100% better than his parents ever did.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a really common excuse for not getting any *better*.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, he&#39;s a better parent than his parents, but does that mean he <br/>\ncan/should stop trying to be a BETTER parent than he is now?<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk with my kids about my childhood and how I had to dump a lot of <br/>\nbad modelling that was done for/to me. I&#39;m hoping that they will have <br/>\n*less* baggage. And that their children will have even LESS!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day, we were at a store where a dad was being very <br/>\ncontrolling and mean to his son. Duncan waked out and said about the <br/>\nlittle boy, &quot;He&#39;ll have a lot of baggage to dump if he&#39;s going to be a <br/>\ngood dad.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we talk about it a lot---Ben and I, the boys and I, Ben and the <br/>\nboys---we all discuss how we can be better and do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are stressed or tired or out of sorts, it&#39;s common---and <br/>\neasy!---to revert to what we were modelled as children. Before we open <br/>\nour mouths, if we can think for *just a moment* (which is really hard <br/>\nwhen we&#39;re not 100% there) whether that is how our children want to <br/>\nremember us, maybe we can make a better choice. Making it just a <br/>\n*little* better *each* time will bring us to being pretty damn close to <br/>\nthe ideal after a while!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so tired of fighting about it (or just not saying anything and<br/>\nseething with anger for days) and I&#39;m sure he is too. I dread the<br/>\nweekends when he is going to be home. I want to find some sort of<br/>\nbalance or happy medium here but I can&#39;t seem to get it right.<br/>\nPlease respond if you have any insight at all. I would appreciate<br/>\nother view points on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk him whether he would like to be a better dad and husband. If he <br/>\nsays no, there&#39;s not much you can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he says yes!, well... you can both talk about how to do that.

And unschooling, well, I didn&#39;t have a clue what that was. But as time went by I came to the idea that this stuff really worked by seeing it work in my kids. My kids blow my mind with how amazing they are.<br/>\n <br/>\nI worked full time in an office, so I was only seeing some of what was going on. (Now I work full time from home and see a lot more about how it works full time.)At first I figured, how bad could it screw them up at a young age? I mean, they had been at home up until school age and seemed great to me.  But then when I saw that it was better than not screwing them up, they were smart, well rounded people. <br/>\n <br/>\nI gotta say it would have really pissed me off if my wife would have corrected me in front of the kids back then. She did a few times, and it really bent me out of shape. We are different people and handle things differently. But now my kids have just learned that their folks have different personalities. I was more of the kind of guy that laid down rules. Now, I am much more laid back and my wife sometimes gets controlling with the kids. So now I step in and say some of the stuff back to her she use to say to me. Most time we both get a kick out of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI would say just talk about in private, but don&#39;t beat it over the guys head. And your kids, well, they&#39;ll figure out how to deal with him on their own. If you do what you know works with the kids, he&#39;ll probably see that and take a que from you. If not, then let your kids see how you deal with him and they&#39;ll figure it out.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems to me that sitting around steaming about it is a waste of time after a certain point.  Instead, take what&#39;s working with your husband and kids and build on that.<br/>\n <br/>\nGood Luck,<br/>\nPatrick <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBoo! Scare away worms, viruses and so much more!

I mean, we have seven kids and almost always two or three  <br/>\nextras.  Part of it is my personality, part of it was being raised by  <br/>\na single mom with one brother, our house was silent most of the time  <br/>\n(ie children aren&#39;t seen OR heard). I spent a long time just ignoring  <br/>\nmy feelings on all the noise, just because I thought that&#39;s what good  <br/>\nmoms do, and then I&#39;d snap. Then because of all the stress, I&#39;d  <br/>\ncompletely revert into saying something that wasn&#39;t kind or  <br/>\nappropriate (like &quot;Would you just SHUT UP!?&quot;) I wonder if it&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething similar. Dh is similar, but his is mess, he can take the  <br/>\nnoise, but not the clutter. He is a lot more patient than I am though.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone already suggested stepping back and verifying the  <br/>\nsituation. Making sure that your feelings aren&#39;t tinting your  <br/>\nperception. I have that problem with my dh as well, and when i  <br/>\nstepped back I noticed that either my kids didn&#39;t take it personally  <br/>\n(ie they knew dh was having a bad day and they chose to ignore it) or  <br/>\nthey would respond (being unschoolers, just last night Sam (heehee)  <br/>\ntold DH, &quot;Well, you keep telling me what to do. I can&#39;t do two things  <br/>\nat ONCE!&quot; Dh was rueful, apologized and did the second thing himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat *I* had to do was accept the fact that my kids are noisy, accept  <br/>\nthe fact that I sometimes had trouble dealing with it. I worked  <br/>\nreally hard on being open to the noise, celebrating it as what NORMAL  <br/>\nchildren do. And then I worked on ways for me to have some silence. I  <br/>\npracticed really hard on what I could say nicely to get some quiet. I  <br/>\ncame up with a stock phrase that I used at first because I wanted it  <br/>\nto be as easy as possible to be kind &quot;Mom&#39;s really worn, can I have  <br/>\nfive minutes, then we&#39;ll do x and z?&quot; Now not only can I deal with  <br/>\nmore noise, but because I know that my kids will respect my need for  <br/>\nsome quiet when I ask, I can deal with even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nDh and I both point out stuff to each other, but never in the heat of  <br/>\nthe moment. We didn&#39;t beat the horse, either, it was one statement  <br/>\nand then breath through letting it go. And when we first started  <br/>\nunschooling, never with the kids there because both of our trained  <br/>\nresponses were &quot;Well, I&#39;M the parent&quot; so I&#39;d let dh see the power of  <br/>\nhis words, and then when the child was gone (usually me saying let&#39;s  <br/>\ngo play) then I&#39;d come back and say something like &#39;that was a really  <br/>\nhurtful way to say that. I know x was bothering you, what else could  <br/>\nwe do?&#39; He&#39;d do the same thing for me (although, tbh, I usually  <br/>\nresisted more than he did....sigh) It almost always leads to us  <br/>\napologizing and saying it was not appropriate. And the answers were  <br/>\nalways different. Sometimes *I* need to intervene. Sometimes it meant  <br/>\nthat he would handle it himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, keep talking to you hubby outside the moment. And i wonder  <br/>\nif you could do something if you KNOW he&#39;s going to lose it. Say your  <br/>\ndaughter is chattering away and you see his tension rising. Then say  <br/>\nit for him...so you can model a dfferent way. Something like &quot;Wow!  <br/>\nThat sounds so exciting!&quot; if she&#39;s want to just share with anyone,  <br/>\noffer &quot;Dad needs a break right now, let&#39;s you and me go talk in the  <br/>\ndining room&quot; or if she wants to share with dad, &quot;Dad&#39;s kind of tired  <br/>\nfrom work, can we let him rest for a little bit before we continue  <br/>\nthe story?&quot; my girls love to draw comic books to remember stuff, so  <br/>\nmaybe while she&#39;s waiting she could share with you again, draw a  <br/>\npicture of what she wanted to say, record it on the camcorder. My  <br/>\nkids LOVE to make newscasts for my husband...and it&#39;s a funny family  <br/>\nthing now because no matter what the news is about, Rachel does the  <br/>\nweather, and Sam&#39;s sporting event always includes a pokemon battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest part of dh&#39;s day is the second he walks in the door. He  <br/>\nhas seven kids (and a wife) on him right away, who&#39;ve missed him and  <br/>\njust want to be with him and tell him everything all at the same  <br/>\ntime. He&#39;s used to working in silence most of the time, or in board  <br/>\nmeetings where people take turns talking (and sometimes no one wants  <br/>\nto talk lol!) So it&#39;s a huge change for him, and just fifteen minutes  <br/>\nin his bedroom changing (even if he&#39;s already wearing jeans and a t- <br/>\nshirt, it&#39;s a symbolic change and guarantees almost some privacy) and  <br/>\ngoing to the bathroom (which usually consists of him reading a  <br/>\nchapter from a new book). This time is just amazing in how it  <br/>\nincreases his patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that you are working really hard on mindful parenting, and  <br/>\nthat&#39;s the number one way to help dh, just to let him know it will  <br/>\nwork.

Write them down if that&#39;s <br/>\nhelpful to you, but not necessarily for him. Just to get things <br/>\nclear in your own mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, think about (or write down) all the things you <br/>\nlove about this man, the reasons you decided to marry him and have <br/>\nchildren with him. If those reasons aren&#39;t compatible with your <br/>\nprinciples, that&#39;s something to think about, too. Maybe you need to <br/>\ndig deeper into the &quot;core&quot; of your values and find the <br/>\ncommonalities. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you&#39;re thinking about your own principles, start looking for <br/>\nhow he&#39;s trying to express *his* principles and validate that! If he <br/>\nvalues protection, see him protecting and honor that - actually <br/>\nexpress that to him. Let him know you appreciate his efforts without <br/>\ntrashing his methodology for awhile. That&#39;s important.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My husband is a very traditional &quot;dictator&quot; parent and has no <br/>\n&gt; desire to change.  He expects the house to always be clean, no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>toys <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; strewn about, for the kids to do what he says...immediately, to be <br/>\n&gt; quiet if he&#39;s watching tv, etc., the list goes on. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you have a sense of what *his* principles are? That may be <br/>\nsomething for the two of you to dialog about. In your and his <br/>\nprinciples there is almost certainly some common ground if you only <br/>\ngo deep enough - really! Once you get all the way down to things <br/>\nlike love and trust and support, you will have a place to start <br/>\ntalking about *how* y&#39;all can go about living those values <br/>\nyourselves in your every day lives. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He expects the house to always be clean<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Once you have some common ground, you can look for some mutually <br/>\nacceptible solutions. Homeschooling is hard on the home! Have you <br/>\nlet him know that most homeschooling parents struggle with this <br/>\nissue (let alone wacked-out unschoolers who think ketchup looks just <br/>\nfine on the windows)? That might help him have a bit of perspective. <br/>\nIs it possible to keep one part of the house extra-clean just for <br/>\nhim? <br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how old your kids are (don&#39;t remember, sorry) you may <br/>\nbe able to involve them a bit in this - dad likes a clean house, <br/>\nwhat can we do to help dad feel good when he comes home? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;to be quiet if he&#39;s watching tv<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does he need some time to change gears and &quot;land&quot; after work? That&#39;s <br/>\nsomething y&#39;all may need to work into your routine. Are there other <br/>\nways for him to do that besides watching tv? Or maybe he can have <br/>\na &quot;quiet space&quot; where he goes to watch his favorite shows? This is <br/>\nthe sort of problem solving that is going to have to come *after* <br/>\nyou&#39;ve established some common ground wrt principles. If he values <br/>\nbeing the leader of the family (for instance) watching tv in silence <br/>\nisn&#39;t necessarily the best way to acheive that. If you can find ways <br/>\nto meet his needs *and* support his principles, the tv may well <br/>\nbecome less of an issue. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;for the kids to do what he says...immediately<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is the one where its most important to understand what his <br/>\nvalues are, so you can see how he believes this to be supporting his <br/>\nprinciples. *Why* does he want them to obey immediately? If its an <br/>\nissue of respect, for example, look for ways for him to feel <br/>\nrespected in the family - and that starts with you, mom, helping him <br/>\nfeel valued and important! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to have an example of a specific incident in the home <br/>\nso we can help you pull it apart and understand better what&#39;s going <br/>\non - there are a whole passle of reasons people claim to want <br/>\ninstant obedience that kind of need different approaches.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest issue in &quot;my dh isn&#39;t on board&quot; situations, is that a <br/>\nfeeling of &quot;us and them&quot; starts to build. Mom and kids *against* <br/>\ndad. That&#39;s detrimental to the family as a whole *and* the <br/>\nindividual relationships within the family. Its really important to <br/>\nhelp dads (or working moms!) feel like their on the same team as the <br/>\nrest of the family - that they&#39;re an Important Part of the team, not <br/>\nthe guy you send out to stand in the corner of the field bc no-one <br/>\never hits the ball there, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":266096457,"authorName":"momma","from":"&quot;momma&quot; &lt;southernbelle@...&gt;","profile":"centurykissed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Husbands","postDate":"1192285774","msgId":27068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlcWtvZStiODIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZlcWpscitpaXU1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27067,"nextInTopic":27072,"prevInTime":27067,"nextInTime":27069,"topicId":27064,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much Meredith!

I have <br/>\nseen a few coments from the ladies here that suggest that this is <br/>\nsomething that you all may deal with at one time or another. <br/>\nMy husband and I get along very well, most of the time. The only <br/>\nissue we seem to have is about the children. He says things to the <br/>\nchildren that are sometimes hurtful (I feel). <br/>\nDo you all comment on it at all? Do you all just let it be? <br/>\nWe have had many discussions and sometimes arguements. Ok, a lot of <br/>\narguements. I seem to go into a protective mode which puts us at <br/>\nodds. I am starting to think that maybe I need to relax a little and <br/>\njust let it go. It seems to happen most with our 8 year old dd. She <br/>\nis a bundle of energy and chatters almost nonstop. This drives him <br/>\nnuts. He will sometimes make a nasty comment to her and hurt her <br/>\nfeelings. I start to worry about her self esteem and how she will <br/>\nexpected to be treated by the men in her life when she gets older. I <br/>\nhave been friends with several women who did not have good <br/>\nrelationships with thier fathers and all of them have chosen bums to <br/>\nshare thier lives with. Am I over analyzing here? Am I being <br/>\noverprotective? Could it be that because of the way I am reacting <br/>\nthat *I* may be standing in the way of them having a better <br/>\nrelationship?  <br/>\nOn the other hand, he grew up in a very abusive and controlling home <br/>\nand is doing 100% better than his parents ever did. <br/>\nI am so tired of fighting about it (or just not saying anything and <br/>\nseething with anger for days) and I&#39;m sure he is too. I dread the <br/>\nweekends when he is going to be home. I want to find some sort of <br/>\nbalance or happy medium here but I can&#39;t seem to get it right.  <br/>\nPlease respond if you have any insight at all. I would appreciate <br/>\nother view points on this.<br/>\nAubrey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43705,"nextTopicId":43700}}
