I was gone for an hour.  While I didn&#39;t expect to come home to a changed child, my offer and his time alone did not make any difference.  He was the same, if not more angry than before.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Though I am not proud of my choice, I chose to turn off the TV for our family for today.  Imo, his consistent viewing seems to be the trigger.  Just as he was starting to groan about the TV being off, a neighbor&#39;s son arrived to play.  They&#39;ve been playing for a while now, and the engaged, interested, and amazing son I knew was in there is showing himself.  Perhaps, I hope, this will mark the beginning of something new and a departure from where we were (ick!!).  Often, the juxtoposing of how we live and function as a family and how our neighbor&#39;s son lives helps us get back into sync.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have another window open and am searching the library&#39;s shelves in a virtual manner to be able to get something more to read.  I will keep looking for triggers too.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have learned that me being calm is paramount to us, as a whole, getting through this.  That said though, I am under constant attack and am sincerely unable to get a good few moments before the next grenade is launched and explodes.  I&#39;m working on it, and I have gotten *much* better, but it&#39;s still a challenge.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Seeing some of the son I know, even for a while today, had helped us all immensely!!

Really stuck.  For the past 4 weeks my 9yo son has been mean, moody, physically violent, nagging, consistently speaking really rudely, every effort being an immense event, and more.   Christopher is a shadow of the person I knew.  He used to be engaged, passionate.  I thought it was a lack of strewing, but he doesn&#39;t seem to find much that catches his attention -- except the TV!!!  I don&#39;t think that TV is &quot;bad&quot; at all, but anything at all for 4 weeks of being in the house to enable him to do it is asking a lot!!     <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The hitting episode I relayed when he hit his 2 yo sister and sent her flying is just some of what he does.  No matter how I choose to engage him, he, almost routinely replies rudely.  Really rudely.  Rolls eyes.  Glares.  Clenches his fists.  If I ask for help, I rarely get it.  If I do, it&#39;s *such* a drama.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I tried to have a discussion with him about his anger, but discussions failed after an amazing start.  Stopped.  Cold turkey.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have tried to discuss what&#39;s bothering him so.  He won&#39;t discuss.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have tried strewing.  I have tried giving until I feel like Gumby.  I thought he needed more one on one time, but he&#39;s really not an easy person to be with, and if I do give him my undivided time, he *still* chooses amazing amounts of rudeness.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are 3 other small people who live here who are also being effected by Christopher&#39;s behaviour.  His 7yo brother, easily the kindest soul on the planet, is starting to head in the same direction.  My 5 yo dd bends over backwards to be kind to me in a seeming effort to compensate.  This too concerns me.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dh is not so on board with the u/s&#39;ing thing.  He says that Christopher needs more control.  If I had more control over him...  He says that Christopher needs structure.  He says that I should just tell him what to do.  None of those options are remotely palatable, but, this is really tough.  Dh also offers that the shows he watches (Cartoon Network, Nick, Disney) have influenced him.  I don&#39;t buy that either.  I have consistently asked 3 other folks to give to enable Christopher his TV, to allow us to leave later, to not go at all at times.  It&#39;s to the point of just plain not being fair to any of us.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;m melting down myself.  Being greeted by a consistent stream of garbage and remaining kind, calm, and collected just isn&#39;t something I can do, nor should I have to -- also something I&#39;ve told Christopher.  I still get basically garbage.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Have any of you BTDT???  I need tools (and not traditional ones!!).  I keep looking for solutions, asking for help/input from Christopher, but I&#39;m getting nowhere.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Help...  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jane <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Get on board.
