There was no need for him to read.  I read<br/>\neverything to him.  Until one day, he got a game manual to help him<br/>\nthrough his Zelda game.  I would read it to him to help wiht his game<br/>\nwhen I could, but I wasn&#39;t up for reading the small print at the crack<br/>\nof dawn or while I was driving, so he had a choice...  read yourself<br/>\nor wait.  He wanted to know what was on that page.  He figured it out.<br/>\n He reads the things that are important to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to find something that your child is very passionate<br/>\nabout and share with her.  Sometimes life makes it so you are<br/>\nunavailable to read for a few minutes.  Your child may surprise you<br/>\nand figure it out herself.  More can happen with less work if you<br/>\nwander in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I was very fortunate to have my boy be the one who was less<br/>\nthan interested in reading because society told me that &quot;boys don&#39;t<br/>\nlearn to read as early as girls&quot;.

It may also help to remember that many other cultures don&#39;t expect children to read until much later than our expectation is in north America - in France, I have been told, they don&#39;t even begin teaching reading in school until 8 years old - and a significant portion of kids don&#39;t learn to read until they are 9 or 10 or even older - and if they are left to themselves, they don&#39;t develop insecurities about it - it&#39;s the school system that labels them learning disabled or whatever - doesn&#39;t mean they actually are.... <br/>\n<br/>\n- I admit that I sometimes found reading to my children a chore (I know we&#39;re not *supposed* to feel that way!), especially when it was the same book over and over - maybe it&#39;s OK if you just say that to her - or set a limit that you can stand, (assuming that she&#39;s *asking* you to read to her?) - tell her you are willing to read 3 books or something and then you want to do something else - I think you have that right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she look at books on her own at all?  Does she like books that are very visual for instance?  You could even maybe say - these are some books for you to look at on your own and these are the ones that we read together - not as manipulation, but to respect your own tolerance level - I mean, we can *challenge* our own tolerance levels, but I think it is also OK for mommies to have tolerance levels!  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she use the computer?  When my kids starting using the computer, I categorically stated that they were on their own to figure out the games - which they did just fine; I would intervene if it was absolutley necessary, but I usually couldn&#39;t help them anyway, and i *hate* computer games!  They probably picked up some reading skills that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably important that you don&#39;t pass on to her a feeling of frustration and impatience around this issue - just let it go, let it be, try to remove any feelings of hostility that you have around it - there&#39;s no telling what they do inside their heads when they sense those kind of feelings coming from us - that is more likely to turn it into an issue, I would think; probably better to relax and let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and don&#39;t feel guilty!!!! judy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: hscomer <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, May 30, 2008 10:39 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] reading<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  ok here is where I am at.

While there are some 7 yos who are developmentally ready to  <br/>\nread and do read by 7, there are loads of kids who are going through  <br/>\nthe motions. The sad thing is that when development kicks in and  <br/>\nthose kids do finally figure out reading, teachers and parents and  <br/>\nkids, are certain it was the teaching that finally worked (or the kid  <br/>\nstopped being lazy or stopped being resistant.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe even sadder thing is that there are kids in school being  <br/>\npressured to read when they won&#39;t be developmentally ready until they  <br/>\nare 12 or older. So for 6 years -- if the schools even provide  <br/>\nservices that long! -- they gaining the impression there&#39;s something  <br/>\nwrong with them, that they&#39;re stupid or lazy.

Is she  <br/>\ndemanding that she be allowed to learn independently and you&#39;re  <br/>\nrefusing until she learns how to read?<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is only one way to learn. And, depending on the child&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning style, not even the best. But books are worshiped as some  <br/>\nultimate window on the world and everything else is a distant second.  <br/>\nI&#39;m certainly not anti-book :-) (If you saw my house that thought  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t even cross your mind!) But what I am is a supporter of  <br/>\nengagement as the best way to learn :-) Whether that engagement takes  <br/>\nthe form of busy hands, observation, videos and TV, video and other  <br/>\ngames, conversation, full body movement or whatever. It makes no  <br/>\ndifference. What does make a difference is the child&#39;s interest in  <br/>\nwhat they&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe assume schools are using the best methods to teach kids. They  <br/>\naren&#39;t. They&#39;re using the most efficient way to impose a body of  <br/>\nknowledge on a mass of people. In order to allow schools to function  <br/>\nthey must make huge sacrifices in what is best for the child.

I think that, too often, children are stopped from taking risks <br/>\nand daring to be (as Cameron put it) *brave* because sometime, <br/>\nsomewhere *someone* put it into their heads thay they weren&#39;t worthy or <br/>\ncapable or &quot;normal&quot; even.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Normal* is relative---and relative to an individual.

I am generally against such labels but I also wanted to give my kids all the tools they wanted to use.  There was a trainer in their method 1 hour away even in Montana.  He met us one evening on a river bank and as we picniked he visited with the kids. I have one child who has expressed considerable frustration over her reading (she is 10) but they all participated.  I presented this exactly as I imagined it: a different way to learn things, especially reading, that they might enjoy learning about.  When my son was 10 and couldn&#39;t yet ride a bike he wanted help with this. So we visited an occupational therapist who worked on balance and coordination.  He enjoyed her and there were no labels on the experience.  My dd decided that for now she &#39;didn&#39;t want to learn this guy&#39;s way of reading&#39; and we didn&#39;t, but she knows that she could pick to do this or<br/>\n something else later.  She sees this like art lessons you might choose, etc.  I did like some of the book&#39;s concrete ideas for the kids when they were younger, like making letters and numbers out of clay, so that it is a tactile and visual experience.  Em liked knowing that she could decide whether this fit for her or not, too.   I sometimes think that my own dyslexia was better off unnoticed (drove me crazy in math) but I wonder if I had labeled myself if I&#39;d have pursued my desire to go to med school as bravely!

Thanks to all you wise and<br/>\nwonderful people. What I wanted to tell you I realize may not be<br/>\ngenerally accepted by the group but I feel there are aspects of it<br/>\nthat have been helpful to my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nI initially started to homeschool my 9yo ds for dyslexia (he is<br/>\nprobably ADD too but never diagnosed I see no need at this point) in<br/>\nSept 06. and our journey has brought us here to the unschooling board<br/>\nand a very free and self directed atmosphere at home. Perhaps we are<br/>\ndeschooling but I have not committed to the saying it just yet, but<br/>\nthat is a whole other post:^).  I have been hoping to come across<br/>\nunschoolers with dyslexia and hear how they may have transitioned from<br/>\na ps or homeschool situations and your experiences. So if you are out<br/>\nthere would love to hear from you. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am also lucky that I have no outside family interference regarding<br/>\nmy choices of schooling at this point, so I am of no help there other<br/>\nthan to say, If you are happy and your kids are happy with how they<br/>\nare learning ignore the outsiders input. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one thing I have done to help my ds with his dyslexia and<br/>\nthought since you asked I would put it out there. Are you familiar<br/>\nwith Ron Davis and his book The Gift of Dyslexia, he created Davis<br/>\nDyslexia Correction Program. I found this to be an effective way for<br/>\nmy son to deal with his learning style. Ron Davis discusses how a<br/>\ndyslexic thinks in pictures, they are visual, multi-dimensional<br/>\nthinkers. I bet your kids are very imaginative and creative love<br/>\nbuilding things with their hands but have little interest in reading<br/>\nor writing and possibly math. My son would rather draw than write and<br/>\nat this point I encourage it. Yes there are some schooly aspects of<br/>\nthe program. They mold the alphabet in clay as well as punctuation and<br/>\nthen sight words. Davis explains that because a dyslexic think in<br/>\npictures, sight word are hard to memorize as there is no picture for<br/>\nthem. So they must create a 3d image of what they feel the word means<br/>\nafter hearing the definition. [ My son was so proud in Kindergarten he<br/>\ncould spell cat by 2nd grade that is the only word he would spell if<br/>\nwe played hangman or something. He got A&#39;s on his spelling test after<br/>\nintense night before drill but could not recall or spell the words<br/>\nafter that]. This follow up work of clay words was great at first, but<br/>\nsoon the novelty wore off so we eventually stopped doing as my son<br/>\ngrew weary of it. This is what made me look even further into more<br/>\nrelaxed and self directed learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things it improved were his ability to focus, and I am not talking<br/>\nabout reading or doing school work( although this has improved for<br/>\nother greatly), I am talking....being able to find his shoes,<br/>\nfollowing directions, paying attention in Tae Kwon Do, got his green<br/>\nstripe 3 months faster  etc..is it perfect no he is nine but they are<br/>\nbetter and these are thing he wanted to be better at and this is how<br/>\nhe applied his new knowledge. He felt better about himself that he<br/>\ncould understand his learning style and ways to help him deal with it.<br/>\nHe feels smart now not stupid which is how he felt in school.  I have<br/>\ntaken to creating an atmosphere that my son likes to learn by<br/>\nappealing to him through these outlets. He watches documentaries of<br/>\nhis choosing, for the last 3 weeks he obsessively watched anything on<br/>\ndinosaurs. Loves shows Bonehead detectives, Prehistoric Planet etc. I<br/>\nno longer sit and force him to read if he does not want to. I read to<br/>\nhim when he is interested. OKay people here is the part don&#39;t shoot me<br/>\nfor :-)! I do ask him to do an www.time4learning.com a couple of time<br/>\na week which he likes and if  he is not in the mood I do not force him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find in most adult dyslexic success stories is that even after<br/>\nyears of remediation that never really got them anywhere but feeling<br/>\nlost and inadequate they finally learned to compensate and deal with<br/>\ntheir issues when they were interested in really learning and no one<br/>\nwas forcing them.  Usually high school or college age. So I keep<br/>\nreading up and encouraging him where I can and let his natural love of<br/>\nlearning bloom. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing about Davis I forgot to mention is the disorientation.<br/>\nDavis explains that dyslexics experience by varying degrees a<br/>\ndisorientation which causes the symptoms of dyslexia. My son cries<br/>\nvery easily depending on the situation can get confused very easily<br/>\nand processes verbal information slowly. They teach a dyslexic to use<br/>\nhis highly visual mind to align his body and stop the disorientation.<br/>\nIt sound like mumbo jumbo but it works.

Over the last couple years he has progressed, very slowly, in <br/>\nthat area but we just let him be, knowing that he would learn when he <br/>\nwas ready.  He went from hardly reading at all to reading everything, <br/>\nalmost overnight- literally!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is interesting to me, comparing my oldest, who was an early <br/>\nreader to Tristan who was a late reader, is that Kevin went through <br/>\nthe whole &quot;inventive&quot; spelling phase.  He would write but you had to <br/>\ntry really hard to decipher what he was trying to say - we were just <br/>\nreading some of his stuff the other day and getting some chuckles.  <br/>\nTristan is not doing that like Kev did.  Tristan asks how to spell <br/>\nthings when he is writing and, for the most part, knows how things <br/>\nare spelled because he didn&#39;t really learn how to read by phonics, <br/>\nlike Kev did. And because he is so much older I guess it is more <br/>\nimportant to him to spell it right, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe process with Tristan has been a lot less painful for me.  I know <br/>\nTristan had some frustrations at times with really wanting to know <br/>\nhow to read but not being ready, and knowing that.  But for me it <br/>\njust seemed like a natural process without some of the awkwardness <br/>\nthat is associated with a new reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in regards to the ADHD and Dyslexia, Tristan definitely has some <br/>\nissues in that regards too.  We choose not to slap a label on him but <br/>\ncertainly, if he was in school, he would have been labeled with a <br/>\nlearning disability.  My husband had dyslexia too and he didn&#39;t learn <br/>\nhow to read until about 10, in the public school system!  Relax, and <br/>\nit will happen just as it is supposed to.

Not to say <br/>\nthat you shouldn&#39;t read to your children, but maybe you shouldn&#39;t feel like <br/>\na failure, like you didn&#39;t do the right things, or that they didn&#39;t do the <br/>\nright things is they aren&#39;t reading yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Simon, who is 10, is not among the readers yet. I&#39;ve read to him <br/>\nsince he was tiny. Anything he wanted, and I still do. And I have no fears <br/>\nbut that he will join the ranks of the reading at some point. Linnaea, who <br/>\nis 7, is reading. She started reading about 6 months ago. And I was really <br/>\nnervous that Simon would feel like he wasn&#39;t as good or as smart or <br/>\nsomething because his little sister had beaten him to the reading goal. He <br/>\nabsolutely wasn&#39;t. He feels no shame in not reading yet. He knows he has <br/>\nstrengths that she doesn&#39;t have, and he totally believes he will be a reader <br/>\nsomeday, just not yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are interesting benefits to not being a reader. Simon listens much <br/>\nbetter than I or Linnaea do. He sees things in video games or in movies that <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t because I look for the information in text. When I read to him, <br/>\nhe will walk away with a better understanding, greater memory for detail of <br/>\nthe story/book than I ever do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere may be reasons other than exposure or focus that keep a child from <br/>\nreading. As far as I know and believe, those things will be overcome with <br/>\ntime. Someone recently said on some list or another that it was their child <br/>\nplaying a video game that got them reading, they&#39;d realized that it would be <br/>\neasier to negotiate the game if they could understand what was being said in <br/>\ntext. And I realized that the poster of that e-mail thought their child <br/>\nwasn&#39;t reading before that because they weren&#39;t interested enough, they <br/>\nweren&#39;t trying hard enough. Maybe the timing of that particular video game <br/>\nwent hand and hand with that child being actually ready to read. Maybe the <br/>\ngame and all of the other pieces of the literacy puzzle came together at the <br/>\nsame moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is an important tool in most people&#39;s lives. Your children will want <br/>\nto negotiate the world fully and will, given time and exposure, master <br/>\nreading without being pressured to do worksheets or to read on command or to <br/>\nplay a phonics game. Just don&#39;t think they are lazy, or not trying hard <br/>\nenough or that you haven&#39;t read to them enough if they aren&#39;t reading by the <br/>\ntime you believe they ought to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Us reading to him, I believe, is instrumental to his high capabililty of <br/>\n&gt; being able to read anything today.

I do think reading together is key, however. <br/>\nMy son (2.75) learned to read, just as he learned to speak, by osmosis...<br/>\nI always read to him, he always wanted me too, (still does, thank goodness, though he can read himself).   By being read to frequently and also much time examining books himself, he learned to read well.  He can presently read nearly as well as me.  He nails words like application, Antartica, revealing.  He can definitely read as fast as I can type, as he sometimes reads aloud over my shoulder.  Yesterday, I discovered when he took my grocery list, that he can read cursive (I cannot fathom how this happened except that my cursive is sort of a hybrid and I guess the letters are recognizable...)  Anyway,  I realize that there are different sorts of intelligences and also that most children don&#39;t have an easy of a time of it as Will did, but by seeing how naturally it did come for him, I imagine that any child who wants to read could also pick it up through absorbing themselves in books....being read to, looking at books themselves, especially with mother or someone nearby...(Will<br/>\n always needs me available to answer &quot;what&#39;s this word,&quot; or &quot;what does this mean?&quot;)   While his awareness and desire for this skill may have been earlier than some other childrens, I would think that any older child would have the same skill and be able to learn to read with the same kind of natural flow and ease.<br/>\nSo what I am saying is, if you read to them and with them, I believe they will absolutely pick it up.  <br/>\nPeace and all good,<br/>\nMillie<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44203,"nextTopicId":44232}}
