I&#39;m a female born under all male signs.  The  males I&#39;ve met with the same or close birthdays are always surprised when I can tell them all about themselves after just meeting them.  It helps that I have an older brother born just a few days after me maybe. Two of my siblings were born two days apart at a different time of the year and they shared similar personalities.  Any who, if you believe a God can create the universe we live in, then it makes sense that the rest of it lines up.<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki who does see the argument between creationism and evolution as being much of a debate. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Laura Beaudin &lt;laura.beaudin@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Friday, September 26, 2008 1:32:20 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] OT strange occurrences WAS:Confessions of a &#39;do it nower&#39;, was  Not being boring ... How?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat reminded me of another eerie situation. I&#39;m on a list for <br/>\ndiabetics and was always conversing with this one lady. Well, it <br/>\nturns out that not only do we live in the same city, but we live in <br/>\nthe same building! We moved upstairs from a 1-bedroom to a <br/>\ntwo-bedroom apartment and I mentioned that. She put two and two <br/>\ntogether, LOL. Even stranger is that we were born only a few days apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:17 AM 26/09/2008, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;There are no less than four Melissa Grays in our town alone!
