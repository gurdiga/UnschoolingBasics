Spend LOTS of time figuring what&#39;s important to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s important to please your own parents, do that. Everything else be damned. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s important that your children can read and tell time, by all means, find what works best---maybe it&#39;s sneaked in journals and calendars and clocks. Maybe it&#39;s worksheets and textbooks. Do whatever you think it takes. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s bedtimes or &quot;Mommy/Daddy time,&quot; make sure the kids are IN BED. Seriously<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if your *relationship* with your child is THE most important thing in your goal-box, do whatever THAT takes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago, Ren wrote a beautiful piece about what her goals for her kids were. I don&#39;t know whether she (or someone else) can find it, but it was inspirational.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI KNOW---without a shadow of a doubt---that my boys will learn what&#39;s important to them. And I figure that a LOT of that stuff will be what their schooled and traditionally homeschooled friends are being forced, cajoled, and bribed to learn. It probably *won&#39;t* be learned at the same time, and my guess is that my boys&#39; learning will actually be remembered a lot longer. But most of the same schtuff will be covered---in their own time. And they have their entire lives to pursue what calls to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I figure the &quot;academic&quot; junk is covered---it just makes sense. ALL that they need will be learned. Simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure that th<br/>\ney will sleep when they are tired, wake when they are rested, eat what makes them feel good, and exercise when they need to. I can&#39;t know what they need---only they can. I *can* help, though!!! A lot!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...what&#39;s my next role? *Our* relationship. And their relationships with others. Relationships aren&#39;t built overnight. Relationships takes years of trust and respect and generosity and patience and honesty. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t risk pulling the wool over their eyes. I need to be up-front and honest. If I were to use a Sneaky Chef recipe because I thought we lacked something in our diets, I would say, &quot;I fixed this with zucchini for extra vitamin X. Can you taste the zucchini? Is it off-putting? Do you like it better?&quot; It&#39;s not worth the sneaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure I&#39;ve been given a finite number of &quot;trust cards.&quot; I use them as rarely as I can. &quot;Trust me; you&#39;ll like it.&quot; But it&#39;s important that I make each card *count*!!! I used one last August when I wanted to go kayaking for my birthday. After all the hurry-upping and waiting we did, the hauling of the equipment to the river, the lugging of the heavy equipment into the river, and the endless instructions, I thought I was going to lose a lot of trust points with Duncan---it was NOT what he was expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as *soon* as he was IN the water and piloting his own kayak, he was HOOKED!  We *all* were! It was a fantastic day. And my trust cards were---not only all there---but I had some extras added to my de<br/>\nck! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI take all this very seriously. My relationship takes precedence over their learning. I KNOW they will learn---that&#39;s a no-brainer. I also know how easily a relationship can be damaged. I take their feelings and their wants and their anxieties seriously. I can&#39;t always fix things or get things---but they do know I *want* to! &lt;G&gt; And that I will do what I can. They also know that they can trust me and depend on me---even when I don&#39;t agree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpend some time to decide what your goals are. Then make THAT the priority. Whatever it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37531,"nextTopicId":37532}}
