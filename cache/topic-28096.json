I will say, though, that I think my second favorite dinner smell <br/>\nis the smell of brown basmati rice cooking - it smells almost like <br/>\npopcorn!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething we&#39;ve been doing for several months now is writing up the <br/>\nmenu for the week on Sunday afternoon. We write it up on the kitchen <br/>\nwall chalkboard. It&#39;s totally malleable - we can switch days of when <br/>\nthings happen and so on, not written in stone by any means and it&#39;s <br/>\ngot input from everyone, whether it&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s have that again this <br/>\nweek&quot; or &quot;Can we skip having that this week, we&#39;ve been having that <br/>\nevery week for a while?&quot;. But, not only does it make pulling together <br/>\na grocery list easier, but it also is a reminder of items we need to <br/>\nget fresh (for instance, we don&#39;t buy frozen fish, we just buy it the <br/>\nday we&#39;ll use it, usually I stop and get it on the way home from <br/>\nwork). Plus, stuff we get doesn&#39;t just sit in the fridge - if I pick <br/>\nup some nice squash on special, it goes on the menu so it gets used <br/>\nbefore it gets ugly. We can tailor it to seasonals as well - for <br/>\ninstance, we&#39;ve been doing a lot more with roasted roots & tubers over <br/>\nthe last couple of months and we usually include a salad supper at <br/>\nleast once a week during the summer and so on. And, it makes things <br/>\nway easier on my sweet DH (the at home parent and chief chef at our <br/>\nhouse) - rather than having to think about what we&#39;ve got, what we <br/>\nwant, what he feels like making, he has something to start with. <br/>\nInstead of scrambling at 4:30 to start dinner, he knows that the <br/>\ndinner for tonight only takes 10 minutes so he can start that just <br/>\nbefore I walk in the door OR tonight&#39;s meal will take a bit of prep <br/>\nwork so he should start it early OR tonight&#39;s dinner would taste <br/>\nreally good with a loaf of fresh bread so he needs to start the bread <br/>\nmachine after lunch so it&#39;ll be ready to slice for dinner. Sometimes <br/>\nstuff happens and the whole plan goes out the window (like this week). <br/>\nAnd, too, if someone decides they don&#39;t like something (say I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel like having pasta tonight but it&#39;s on the menu) we can discuss it <br/>\nin advance of dinnertime and modify things - whether it&#39;s a total <br/>\noverhaul of the situation (switch the pasta to tomorrow and do nachos <br/>\ntonight) or a tweak to it (throw together an alfredo sauce instead of <br/>\ntomato sauce). It&#39;s always an evolving things but it has a baseline to <br/>\nstart from. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Meeting needs...","postDate":"1196963499","msgId":28266,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTA2NDdDOUNCNTlBRC0xMzQtMzVBMUBtYmxrLWQ0OC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZqOTM5ZitqMHUzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28265,"nextInTopic":28267,"prevInTime":28265,"nextInTime":28267,"topicId":28096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not that he doesn&#39;t like good food---it&#39;s <br/>\njust that he&#39;ll eat whatever&#39;s put in front of him and is grateful for <br/>\nit all.

He <br/>\ntruly doesn&#39;t care---he&#39;ll eat whatever I make.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I*, on the other hand, have all *sorts* of cravings throughout the day <br/>\nand month and year.

Latkes and <br/>\nhomemade applesauce. Tonight, chili. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys ---I have one of each. Cameron likes what he likes when he <br/>\nlikes it, and Duncan is happy to eat whatever&#39;s available. BUT! Ben and <br/>\nCameron can eat the same thing day after day, and Duncan and I like to <br/>\nchange it up more often. There&#39;s always some leftover in the &#39;frig&#39; <br/>\nthat can become lunch or a snack or an option for supper.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never cook something new without having something &quot;in reserve&quot; <br/>\nfor those who don&#39;t care for it.

I did that for over 20 years before I changed my way of thinking. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Here is the way cooking goes at our house. And the only rule I have for eating is that you have to clean up after you are done.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Our daughter is 11 and a vegan. she cooks her own food, unless she needs my help in cutting things up, (she cut herself once and does not like to use a knife) she does not like to eat with other people so she eats when she wants..<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Our nephew is 18,  has Asperger syndrome( a form of Autism) he can get his own ceral for breakfast, make a sandwich or tv dinner for lunchin the microwave. He can not use an oven or stove. He eats his lunch at 1:30 so he can watch a show on tv while he eats,  I make his dinner for him around 6:30. If I did not set a dinner time for him he would forget to eat. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My husband works 2nd shift - so I cook his dinner in the mornings so he can take it to work. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Our son 6 is a very picky eater. I make his food when ever he is hunger. Which is mostly a  french toasted cheese with peanut butter sandwich. Tastes really good with Swiss Cheese.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My husband and I eat breakfast/lunch together, and I have dinner sometime between whenever and never.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Last night I made Mac & Cheese for our son, I took half the Mac & Cheese and added Tuna for our nephews dinner later on, with our nephews dinner I made peas to go with the Tuna/Mac&chesse, I made enough Peas for my dinner later and our daughters lunch or dinner  tomorrow.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   I always try and have peas/corn/greenbeans/and boiled potatoes in the frig at all times and frozen fries in the freezer.. That makes making meals a breeze for everybody. fast and easy way to cook frozen fries... Microwave them for a few mintues, then put them under the broiler to crisp them up. takes about 10 minutes,no perheating the oven,waiting 20 to 40 minutes for fries anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I know I have rambled so, I off to go stain spindles with my husband. <br/>\n  Have a great day to all,<br/>\n  Oneida<br/>\n  Wife to John<br/>\n  Mom to <br/>\n  DS 25 married with a family of his own<br/>\n  DS 18 lives on his own<br/>\n  DD 11<br/>\n  DS  6<br/>\n  Nephew 18 <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

It&#39;s arranged more like a<br/>\nworkshop than a typical kitchen. The bread machine and all the assorted<br/>\ncanistered items are on a 3 shelf sturdy wire mesh shop cart that he can<br/>\nwheel over to the counter instead of walking back and forth (we have<br/>\nridiculously little counter space). We try as much as possible to adhere<br/>\nto Alton Brown&#39;s ban on uni-taskers in the kitchen - if it&#39;s only good<br/>\nfor sectioning grapefruit and nothing else, it goes out. If it can dice<br/>\nand slice and core a apple, it stays. Even when we bought a rice cooker,<br/>\nit could also do oatmeal (and probably other grains, we just never tried<br/>\nthem). The bread machine not only makes bread loaves but also pizza<br/>\ndough and fruit jam! The grain grinder we&#39;re looking at for next year<br/>\n(so we can make our own whole grain flour) also grinds nuts and seeds<br/>\n(so we can grind the wheat to make the bread and grind the peanuts to<br/>\nmake the PB and we already make our own berry jam - that&#39;s one fresh<br/>\nlunch!) He even took the cabinet doors off the above counter cabinets to<br/>\nmake the stuff in them easier to access. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the food side of things, we&#39;ll do things like cook one or two extra<br/>\nchicken breasts if we&#39;re cooking chicken. It takes no extra time for<br/>\nthat night and makes the next night&#39;s fajitas ready in minutes. Ditto<br/>\nfor things like peppers and onions - we buy bunches of fresh bell<br/>\npeppers when they&#39;re in season/on special and clean and slice them and<br/>\ntoss them into the freezer. Pull them and the frozen pre-chopped onions<br/>\nout, toss into a skillet to saute, slice and toss in the already-cooked<br/>\nchicken, add seasonings, while that&#39;s going, warm some flour tortillas<br/>\nin the microwave and put the sour cream, salsa and cheese (with grater)<br/>\non the table - fajitas in under 15 minutes (and it&#39;s one of many<br/>\nmix-n-match meals we do).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It implies that kids would give mom as little thought as most of us give the guy at the coffee shop who makes hash browns. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be a spectacular achievement if I was as efficient as a short order cook.  The perfect solution to the problem of feeding multiple hungry people!   <br/>\n<br/>\nHungry kids came from the mom, by the way, they didn&#39;t show up out of the blue, expecting to be fed.  They&#39;re there because that person who thinks she oughtn&#39;t have to cook to suite everyone made them.   But I digress. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know someone who&#39;s learning the skill of short order cooking.  Fry cooking, they call it here.   She&#39;s organized her workspace to be convenient, she prepares everything ahead that can be prepared ahead and she can have four plates of food in front of four hungry people in twelve minutes.   I don&#39;t know about you but I think that&#39;s fantastic!   Wouldn&#39;t that be a cool thing for mom&#39;s to know how and be willing to do?  Dinner in twelve minutes?  Everyone happy?  Stunning!<br/>\n<br/>\n *** I try to vary the menu enough that everyone feels like<br/>\nhe got something he wanted at least once a week.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be possible to fix one thing each kid likes every night?  That&#39;s three different things.  I&#39;m not a great cook but I can make three different side dishes each night.  But does it really happen that all three kids don&#39;t like any part of what was made?  If that&#39;s rare then mom would really only be making one or two other side dishes in addition to what was planned.   If it does happen that all three kids don&#39;t like what&#39;s on the menu then maybe it would be better to stop fixing that stuff instead of repeatedly putting it in front of people who don&#39;t like it. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** However, some of<br/>\nthe issue is power and control. You can very quickly get into a<br/>\npower struggle over the dinner menu.***<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t struggle for power unless they&#39;ve been made to feel powerless.  They feel powerless when adults are controlling.  It&#39;s a learned behavior.  If any mom feels like her kids are trying to control her she needs to stop controlling her kids.  She needs to look within herself for her power issues and resolve them because children do not learn to do this without it being routinely modeled to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important  for people who want to unschool successfully to stop thinking of their kids as trying to control them.   That&#39;s a negative way to think about kids and it will lead to resentment on all parts at the very least and to real control issues eventually that won&#39;t be easily undone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the mom feels powerless because kids want to eat something different from what she planned, that&#39;s a problem within the mom.  That&#39;s psychology from some time previous to kids that should be given the heave-ho ASAP if a peaceful unschooling home is her goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90323324,"authorName":"Shannon Rizzo","from":"&quot;Shannon Rizzo&quot; &lt;shannon@...&gt;","profile":"shnunrizzo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Meeting needs...","postDate":"1196701486","msgId":28184,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3NTQzNzNiLjAyYmQyNDBhLjExMWEuZmZmZmFkMmNAbXguZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWM4MzViZiRmMDZmMjJhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":28178,"nextInTopic":28258,"prevInTime":28183,"nextInTime":28185,"topicId":28096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Adrean, One of the things I do is every few months (or more often if the kids want to) we sit down and list some of our favorite foods.

I make sure to have<br/>\nstocked at least 3-5 meals for each kid (I have 4 kids).  That way, on any<br/>\ngiven day if I&#39;m starting a meal and someone doesn&#39;t feel like it, I have a<br/>\nhandful of options for them.  My kids also love being part of the cooking<br/>\nprocess and creating the menu.  There are great kids cookbooks out there<br/>\nnow, from simple ideas for young ones (Cooking Art by Mary Anne Kohl) to<br/>\nimaginative ones (Fairy Tale Feasts by Jane Yolen, in which there is a fairy<br/>\ntale and then a selection of meals from that story), to simple ideas for<br/>\nolder kids (Honest Pretzels by Mollie Katzen).  Around here now whenever my<br/>\nhusband or I start cooking, we have at least one kid come running to<br/>\nparticipate.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t view the differing needs as conflict; when we go to restaurants we<br/>\ndon&#39;t all order the same thing.  There are so many resources out there that<br/>\nthis can be a launching point to some fun cooking or just snack activities<br/>\nwith your kids.  The Cooking Art is especially good for snack trays and<br/>\nmidday activities (shaping dough into designs and baking).  One thing I do,<br/>\nhaving so many kids, is try to meet the needs before they become needs.  For<br/>\nexample I will make a fruit/veggie tray and set it out between meals and/or<br/>\nas I begin to cook.  They wander in to say they&#39;re hungry and there&#39;s<br/>\nalready a nice tray of snacks there for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, since I am at my lowest energy point and most frazzled by late<br/>\nafternoon, I find it more enjoyable to cook earlier in the day as much as<br/>\npossible.  It feels cozy to putter about the kitchen making good things<br/>\nwhile the kids play around me, instead of trying to crank something out when<br/>\nthey are hungry and grumpy.  So I may at least do the prep (chopping,<br/>\nmarinating) earlier in the day.  Also, I group like things together when I<br/>\ncook - for example if I&#39;m making a batch of spaghetti sauce I may make chili<br/>\nand red beans & rice at the same time:  all involve chopping onions,<br/>\ncarrots, etc. and simmering on the cook top.  I simply refrigerate or freeze<br/>\nthe meals we aren&#39;t eating.  If I am grilling meat I may brine/marinate<br/>\nseveral kinds and grill them at once, then freeze immediately to seal in the<br/>\njuices (we love our Foodsaver).  Even simply doubling whatever I&#39;m cooking<br/>\nyields a surplus of meals quickly.  In no time you can have 10-15 meals<br/>\nfrozen and ready to go for those days when you need extra help.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.503 / Virus Database: 269.16.13/1164 - Release Date: 12/2/2007<br/>\n11:30 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Meeting needs...","postDate":"1196695186","msgId":28178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWM4MzViZiRmMDZmMjJhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4="},"prevInTopic":28174,"nextInTopic":28184,"prevInTime":28177,"nextInTime":28179,"topicId":28096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Sometimes when I make meals it can be a complex cooking and logistical matter.** Make simpler things to suit the tastes of your kids. ***So when I bring the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-346716784\">***Sometimes when I make meals it can be a complex cooking and logistical<br/>\nmatter.**<br/>\n<br/>\nMake simpler things to suit the tastes of your kids.    <br/>\n<br/>\n ***So when I bring the food out and one of the boys want something<br/>\nelse, I say, well I worked hard to make this and it is &quot;good&quot; food.

If we think of our good parenting skills as infinitely renewable we don&#39;t become our own brick wall stopping point. <br/>\n<br/>\n*** In a healthy relationship as others have said,<br/>\nconsensus can be met by talking things through***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not consensus if a kid hears &quot;I worked hard to make this...&quot; (food you don&#39;t want) ...&quot;you can make (something else) yourself.&quot;   <br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not talking things through to say the equivalent of &quot;tough&quot; to a kid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make simple things you already know your kids like you can spend your energy making those favorite things with love.  That&#39;s the secret of energy.

It&#39;s not exclusive to children.  If you worked in a restaurant many customers would want different things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nAdults have more experience in the world and can (usually) more easily accept when they don&#39;t get what they want because they know they can get it later.   But kids don&#39;t have that certainty that a thing will be available to them at another time, so they might seem more urgent in their need and more disappointed if they don&#39;t get what they want. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Conflict&quot; conjures up some pretty negative stuff.  It might help you to not see the different needs of your kids as &quot;in conflict.&quot;  The needs aren&#39;t fighting each other.  The needs are needs. <br/>\n<br/>\n*You* have the challenge of finding the best way to meet the needs of everyone, but that&#39;s not a problem with the kids, it&#39;s not their fault.  They might need different things at the same time but that&#39;s not conflict, that&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;   Your kids will get better at waiting a few minutes, better at being patient. The more they see you trying to meet their needs even when they each need something different the more confident they will be that their needs will be met.  It won&#39;t be as hard for them to wait a few minutes because they&#39;ll know, absolutely, that you will be there with what they need. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you did well.  Did you ask them what they wanted first?  That&#39;s the only thing I can see that might have helped.  And it might not have helped!  When my kid was hungry he didn&#39;t want questions he wanted food!&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I do think that I could have done it with more<br/>\nlove though.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made me smile.  Some moms would be here grumping about their ungrateful kids and your worry was that you might have met your child&#39;s need with more love.  I think you&#39;re doing fine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nIt helped me a lot to think about how I would have liked my mom to be with me when I was little.  It helped me to be more patient with Dylan when I remembered how much I would have appreciated some loving patience from my mom.  It&#39;s ok to use tricks to help yourself.  Put a little note on your cupboard door, a favorite quote that inspires you  - or imagine someone you respect and look up to is right there in the room watching how you are with your kids.  Any little trick to help you stay calm and loving will help you.  And before long you won&#39;t need the tricks.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***What do you all do to meet the needs of both or all children when many of<br/>\ntimes things are conflicting?***<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to think of it as conflict.  That might be enough to change the stress level in your head.  Think of each need as a separate thing and do your best to meet each need.  If you can be calm it might help your kids be calmer too.   Time will help.  They won&#39;t be little forever. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":315167313,"authorName":"guideforthree","from":"&quot;guideforthree&quot; &lt;guideforthree@...&gt;","profile":"guideforthree","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Meeting needs...","postDate":"1196448220","msgId":28127,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZpcGxrcytkYXBzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExOTYzNzE3MDYuRkRERUIzOUBiZTEyLmRuZ3Iub3JnPg=="},"prevInTopic":28126,"nextInTopic":28174,"prevInTime":28126,"nextInTime":28128,"topicId":28096,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Adrean, I have to say, you need to lose the guilt trip.

With <br/>\nfive people there is bound to be someone who doesn&#39;t like what I fix <br/>\nfor dinner.  I try to vary the menu enough that everyone feels like <br/>\nhe got something he wanted at least once a week.  I even on occasion <br/>\nfix something I don&#39;t like just because someone else does like it.  <br/>\nEveryone knows they can choose whether they eat what I fix -- no <br/>\nguilt or strings attached.  Not liking the food does not give them <br/>\nliberty to hurt my feelings with rude comments.  They simply get up <br/>\nand fix something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the issue with the food is not liking it.  However, some of <br/>\nthe issue is power and control.  You can very quickly get into a <br/>\npower struggle over the dinner menu.  I chose to opt for empowering <br/>\nmy children without giving them control over me.  It is not enough to <br/>\nallow them to fix something else to eat.  You need to take the time <br/>\nto teach them.  You take them to the grocery store and give them the <br/>\npower to make buying decisions.  You give them a portion of the <br/>\ngrocery budget and let them make choices within those financial <br/>\nconstraints (with no guilt attached).  You show them how to opperate <br/>\nthe kitchen appliances (a three year old can opperate a microwave <br/>\nwith supervision).  You show them how to prepare simple items.  You <br/>\nkeep ready to eat items (like Smuckers Uncrustables) stocked for the <br/>\nlittle ones who don&#39;t have the motor skills to fix their own peanut <br/>\nbutter and jelly.  You keep ready to microwave items (corndogs, bagel <br/>\nbites, etc) in the freezer.  In short, you give them the power to fix <br/>\nwhat ever they want to eat with no strings and no guilt attached.  <br/>\nBut you really have to be proactive - teach them how to do it <br/>\nthemselves before your energy and nerves are low.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I did pick up on that dissappointment vibe.  You spent all that <br/>\ntime and energy making that meal, and they don&#39;t appreciate it.  You <br/>\nneed to find some other way to get your validation.  If you cook <br/>\nelaborate meals because it is something you enjoy and do for <br/>\nyourself, then great.  You should still enjoy it even if no one else <br/>\nappreciates it (Think - yummy - more for me).  Otherwise, you need to <br/>\nopt for something a little less exhausting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Adrean Clark &lt;adrean@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I had brought her water, but she wanted sprite.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes when I make meals it can be a complex cooking and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>logistical <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; matter.

My 10 yo wanted to learn how to use <br/>\nthe microscope also, and he didn&#39;t want to wait.  We have a policy of <br/>\nsharing is a choice, and the 7yo had the microscope first.  Thus, I was <br/>\nplaced in a position where any choice (show both kids, or one at a time)<br/>\nI made would be a bad one.  At first I sided with the younger kid (he <br/>\ndid have the microscope first), but that caused the 10yo to <br/>\nerupt...&quot;it&#39;s not fair, I&#39;m never helping you with the dishes again, <br/>\netc.&quot;  I just walked out the front door and closed it behind me.  I <br/>\nfelt like a trapped animal and had to escape.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the two minutes it took for me to regain my freedom and clearity <br/>\nof thought, I walked back in and explained that I would not be placed <br/>\nin the middle of this.  I didn&#39;t think that was fair to me.  I <br/>\nexplained the options (one at a time or both together) and told them <br/>\nthey would have to come up with the solution.  I walked out of the room <br/>\nand started unloading the dishwasher.  Less than two minutes later my <br/>\n10yo (who was never going to help with the dishes again!) came in and <br/>\nstarted helping with the dishes.  He told me they decided to share the <br/>\nmicroscope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson I learned:  Do not take sides when two kids have conflicting <br/>\nneeds.  Instead, explain the situation (no matter what I choose, <br/>\nsomeone will get hurt).  List the options.  Tell them they need to come <br/>\nto a decision and let me know what they decide.  Leave the room (but <br/>\nstay alert and available in case of bloodshed).<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times when kids put you in a situation like this it just turns <br/>\ninto the &quot;who does mommy love more?&quot; game.
