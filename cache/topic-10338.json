No one loves her like you do, (no matter how great some  school <br/>\nstaff might be), no one knows her like you do, and no one will go out of  <br/>\ntheir way to do the best for her like you will.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling will let her learn all things on her OWN schedule, and in  <br/>\nparticular those &quot;life skills&quot; that are taught in school are much better learned  <br/>\nthrough living life for real.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe is still young, and school personnel (I used to do preschool special ed  <br/>\nservices) will try so hard to tell you all the things she CAN&#39;T do, all the  <br/>\nareas she needs to improve in order to be like other kids!  I&#39;m guessing  you <br/>\ndon&#39;t want her to be like other kids- you want her to be her.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt home she will have 1:1 attention from mom who loves her, what a great  way <br/>\nto live, no matter what your diagnosis, medical condition, or whatnot.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\ngood luck,<br/>\nAmanda B.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10334,"nextTopicId":10336}}
