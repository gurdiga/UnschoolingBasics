This is our first year homeschooling. Well today after Park Day with our little local group my daughter and I took a quick stop at the local art museum to check out a new exhibit and to ask about using their piano for lessons. I would teach my daughter. Well that won&#39;t fly with them but that&#39;s ok we will find another way to get her piano lessons. Anyway, on the drive home my daughter began to divulge little girlie secrets, something she hasn&#39;t done in ages. Then she let the big bomb drop, she loves homeschooling! Especially since we have gone full swing into unschooling. I wouldn&#39;t say we are radical unschoolers but we are working towards that end, a lot of things to change for us so a little at a time and it is all falling into place. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t believe the child that was begging to go back to PS this coming fall looked at me and asked if she could just stay a homeschooler. I couldn&#39;t believe how much trust she was placing in me once again. It felt so good, she even voluntarily shared this information with DH. The smile on his face was unbelievable. His little girl apparently entrusted him with some little secret as well which really made his day. We have a lot to change in our point of view as parents but we are working on it and apparently we have chosen the right path. I didn&#39;t ask her why or what changed her mind, I am guessing that will come along the way some where. But she thanked us for pulling her from PS and for agreeing that we should just continue as we are. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://tammycurry. blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://crazy- homeschool- adventures. blogspot. com/<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://myspace. com/mamabeart00<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n\t <br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184269211,"authorName":"rebecca de","from":"rebecca de &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt;","profile":"rebeccadehate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] I just had to share","postDate":"1237616041","msgId":38999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMjAxLjI0OTgwLnFtQHdlYjU2MTA1Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3NDIyMS4zNzU4My5xbUB3ZWI0NTMwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38994,"nextInTopic":39000,"prevInTime":38998,"nextInTime":39000,"topicId":38985,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s funny about the lady going for a walk with you...

It sounds like he just needed to check the grass on the other side of the fence. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of her revelation came from a little girl she has been hanging out with. She thought they were going to be BFF&#39;s. However, she is finding her boring and is tired of being grilled by the little girl and her mother, the first I had heard of it. I know the mother the first time very proudly told me that her daughter had been in PS since the age of 3. Well, while we were out walking after dinner she decided she was going to grill momma. What do you do all day? How can you stand to be with your kids all day? I am very proud of my daughter having been in school since she was three years old. It lead to a very interesting conversation but lets say I don&#39;t think the offer to come over for coffee will be extended again.
