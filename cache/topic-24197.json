Hmmmm. . . only just about every parent who has started off<br/>\none way and transitioned to a more relaxed way of hsing. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a tremendous shift in thinking for most people. Those of us who<br/>\nhave been unschooling for a whole know that it works for our families,<br/>\nknow that our children are happy and happily learning. But it&#39;s a big<br/>\nstep for anyone who is leaving an institutional school or discontinuing<br/>\nmore structured hsing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you could think of this next period of months, for<br/>\nas long as you need, as a period of deschooling. The same as if you were<br/>\nleaving public school. Try to &quot;do nothing.&quot; It will seem like you are<br/>\ndoing nothing but then, I am sure, you will discover that you have been<br/>\nunable to actually &quot;do nothing.&quot; That you and your children will have<br/>\nenjoyed a movie together or gone to the park and noticed the birds or<br/>\ngone to the beach and picked up shells or took out the paints and made a<br/>\nmess -- and there you go, you&#39;re unschooling. :) You will find that you<br/>\nhave accidentally (and not &quot;accidentally on purpose&quot; because Mom thought<br/>\nthe shells were a good opportunity to learn the letter S) learned and,<br/>\nbtw, enjoyed yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you continue living and learning with your children. Have fun! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Thu, 2007-06-07 at 07:33 +0000, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; unschooling <br/>\n&gt; Posted by: &quot;KARA CASSIDY&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dachac3@...\">dachac3@...</a>   dachac3 <br/>\n&gt; Wed Jun 6, 2007 1:56 pm (PST) <br/>\n&gt; How do you unschool well I guess what I am trying to say is I have<br/>\n&gt; gone from homeschooling to unschooling I have done away with lesson<br/>\n&gt; plans and schedules and I am going with what ever the kids are<br/>\n&gt; interested in my family was not happy with homeschooling so they are<br/>\n&gt; really not happy with unschooling my only concern is my kids are 14 12<br/>\n&gt; and 3 my older two hate reading and are not even willing to try to<br/>\n&gt; learn my 14 year old is so so at reading my 12 year old for get it she<br/>\n&gt; hates it she is ADHD and dyslexic so I have to take that in to<br/>\n&gt; consideration I am just a little nervous about doing away with the<br/>\n&gt; structure of schooling has any one else had these feelings and how did<br/>\n&gt; you go from work books to trusting in the unschooling approach? </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24196,"nextTopicId":17159}}
