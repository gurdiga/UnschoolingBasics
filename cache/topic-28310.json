I&#39;m going to enjoy myself,not do anything useful<br/>\nwhatsoever.Everbody fend for yourself now.BTW, Dh lost his job<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s just doing what is fun now, and we no longer have a<br/>\nhouse or car,or electricity. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is exactly what all four of us in our family do everyday.  We do<br/>\nexactly what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is in viewing things that were formerly &quot;have-tos&quot; and chores as<br/>\nthings that are enjoyable.  I like to cook and clean for my family because I<br/>\nenjoying caring for people I love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like doing laundry because I like to wear clean clothes.  I like to make<br/>\nmy bed in the morning because I like to get into a made bed at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy house isn&#39;t as clean as it used to be because I don&#39;t care about it being<br/>\nas tidy as it once was, and nobody else in our family cares that much about<br/>\nit being perfect either.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because you&#39;re enjoying yourself doesn&#39;t have to mean that you aren&#39;t<br/>\ndoing anything useful.  And I hope that everyone in our family is doing what<br/>\nthey love so that going to work is a joyful choice.  This is why we started<br/>\nunschooling in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling is all about living a joyful life.  The doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nthat important things don&#39;t get done, they just get done without the<br/>\nfeelings of drudgery that some many people attach to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing everything with joy will help your kids want to do the things most<br/>\nparents make their kids do.  What I mean is, most parents coerce kids into<br/>\ndoing chores, helping out around the house.  In these homes, chores are<br/>\nunpleasant tasks that parents make you do because they are important to the<br/>\nparents.  In RU homes, household tasks are done by the person who would like<br/>\nthem done, with joy and with no coercion.  This is not to say that the<br/>\nparents do everything, because when you model doing household tasks<br/>\njoyfully, others want to get in on the action - the kids do see these things<br/>\nas yucky.<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoni Zander<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PhotoCEO@...\">PhotoCEO@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChoosingFreedom@...\">ChoosingFreedom@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife/Parent Coaching at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com\">http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nblogging at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com\">http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28302,"nextTopicId":28313}}
