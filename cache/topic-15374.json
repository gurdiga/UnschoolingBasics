Apathy is what gets laws passed and people<br/>\nelected that shouldn&#39;t be in our laws or be our lawmakers.

I just wanted to  <br/>\nadd another little story about it. I&#39;ve talked to my dad and stepmom  <br/>\na bit about how we&#39;re unschooling, but don&#39;t really bring it up with  <br/>\nanyone else. Primarily it&#39;s none of their dang business, and I don&#39;t  <br/>\nreally make it an issue. Yesterday, however, at the 4th party that my  <br/>\naunt has every year, my school teacher cousin brought it up. Not  <br/>\nhostility, but it makes me wonder what everyone is saying behind my  <br/>\nback ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were waiting for the fireworks to begin, and she says loudly, &quot;So,  <br/>\nMelissa, I hear that you aren&#39;t using any materials to teach your  <br/>\nchildren.&quot; I smiled and agreed, and told her that the method we are  <br/>\nusing is called unschooling. I also informed her that she was able to  <br/>\ngoogle online about unschooling, John Hold and Alfie Kohn (although I  <br/>\nwas struggling to remember anything, I tend to short circuit whenever  <br/>\nsomeone asks me questions about my kids, I&#39;m that protective). Then I  <br/>\njust turned back around. I think they were surprised because they  <br/>\nwere expecting me to get defensive and start spouting how great it  <br/>\nwas and how much my kids were learning. But I really didn&#39;t feel the  <br/>\nneed because I don&#39;t GIVE A FLYING F about what they think! :-P We&#39;ve  <br/>\ncome a long way baby!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was already ticky because earlier when Breanna was having a  <br/>\nmeltdown I saw her just staring out of the corner of my eye while I  <br/>\nwas trying to help Bre settle back down. She told me at the last get  <br/>\ntogether that she&#39;s &#39;learned alot&#39; about autism because they have an  <br/>\nautistic kid at their school. Sheesh. Reminds me of someone saying &quot;I  <br/>\nlove indians, I know one at work&quot;. KWIM? It&#39;s the whole token  <br/>\nminority type of thing...she still knows NOTHING about autism.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it feels really good, and maybe immature like I&#39;m thumbing my  <br/>\nnose at them, but please. My 11 year old was the only one yesterday  <br/>\nwho knew the declaration of independence (yes, by heart, he&#39;s really  <br/>\nbeen interesting in it lately) Every one else started off with the  <br/>\npreamble or (God help us) Lincolns &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot;.  <br/>\nJosh was stunned that no one, on the fourth of july, knew the words,  <br/>\nbut they all knew the latest scores from the sports. Heehee. We had  <br/>\nbeen practicing earlier, trying to &#39;read it with feeling&#39;. We had a  <br/>\nlot of fun! He&#39;s cool that way, he&#39;s the only kid I know who&#39;s  <br/>\nstopped the govt candidates in their tracks to ask their opinion on  <br/>\nthe latest case law on the second amendment. :-P<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15368,"nextTopicId":15359}}
