There was a reason for it, explained\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>in terms they understood.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI think that is the key thing (to summarize your whole post in a\r<br/>\nnutshell) - it&#39;s not one of a great many arbitrary rules and regulations\r<br/>\nwhere Mom is nattering constantly about what not to do. When &quot;NO!&quot; or\r<br/>\n&quot;STOP!&quot; is used only infrequently for really serious situations, it gets\r<br/>\nheard more easily than if there&#39;s a constant stream of No, No, No, Stop,\r<br/>\nDon&#39;t, ... No stands out when there are mostly Yeses. Oh, and\r<br/>\n&#39;arbitrary&#39; is an important part of that - some people come to\r<br/>\nunschooling thinking they are hearing &quot;we never have ANY rules&quot; and\r<br/>\nthink &#39;chaos&#39;. Well, chaos happens (lol) but that&#39;s life with people.\r<br/>\nThe difference is that the rules that exist are there for a reason,\r<br/>\nusually safety (of self, of others) not simply it&#39;s more convenient for\r<br/>\nthe adults.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen DS was a tot in a car seat, he was given the authority to YELL at\r<br/>\nus if we somehow forgot to get him buckled and started the ignition. I\r<br/>\nthink it happened maybe twice in all his car seat years - those times\r<br/>\nwhen DH and I both had our hands full and I thought DH buckled DS in and\r<br/>\nDH thought I did and we got in and got the car started and DS would YELL\r<br/>\nBuckle Buckle Buckle. Not only did it give him a bit of empowerment (to\r<br/>\nborrow a very overused word) but that very empowerment reinforced how\r<br/>\nimportant it was to be safe in that regard. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHe turns 11 today and we&#39;ve never had to change a rule because there are\r<br/>\nonly two in our house that apply to all persons at all times - be safe,\r<br/>\nrespect others - those two cover wearing car seats, not hitting, not\r<br/>\nthrowing other people&#39;s stuff around, etc. How it looks varies depending\r<br/>\non what&#39;s going on but the bottom line doesn&#39;t change. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.

You hear all this advice worded in ways you are not familiar with and it may sound like you are supposed to throw everything you know out the window and everything will be peachy.<br/>\nWell, no matter what you do, everything will not be peachy every moment of the day.<br/>\nBut unschooling is a lovely way to live and can lead to more overall peachiness. :)<br/>\nBut there are times when I do act like a pretty traditional Mom. When the almost-3-year-old Nephew discovered that he could reach the frontseat seat belt from his carseat in the backseat (it&#39;s a small car), that was a very traditional &quot;pull the car over and pry the seat belt from the baby&#39;s hand&quot; moment. <br/>\nI then had to remember to buckle the thing even if there was no frontseat passenger. And, yes, if I had thought of it earlier, there never would have been the dramatic moment on US1. But I didn&#39;t and DN was not listening in the moments when I was telling him to stop playing with the seatbelt strap, pictures of a strangling 3-year-old quickly running through my mind. So there was no calm, sweet discussion. There was physical removal of the danger from the child. <br/>\nAnd, yes, he was in his carseat. The car doesn&#39;t move unless we are all buckled in. It&#39;s about safety. <br/>\nBut, importantly, it&#39;s not about me. Not about me being in control or having power. It&#39;s not one of many nitpicking rules. It&#39;s one of very few, very basic, very necessary rules.  When DN or one of the other kids gets a reaction from me like the yelp and the dash to the curb and the obviously upset looks and the removal of the frontseat strap from DN, it is unusual. I think it makes an impression because it is not just another dithering Mom thing. It must be important. <br/>\nI also had a long talk one day with this same almost-3-year-old. About keeping his seatbelt on while in his car seat. Although DN does not talk yet he understands. Every darned word so don&#39;t mention going anywhere if you aren&#39;t prepared to leave now -- he loves to go! Or cookies -- don&#39;t mention cookies. Or his Uncle&#39;s van -- a wonderful place to play. :) Anyway, he had squirmed out from under the shoulder straps one day. I, again, pulled over and readjusted everything. But the whole time, I was talking to him in a serious voice. About being safe and not wanting him to get hurt and that&#39;s why he needed to stay buckled up, etc. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think we&#39;ll never have that conversation again but I do know that my kids understood why we use seatbelts at a very young age and it wasn&#39;t long before it wasn&#39;t any issue at all. But it wasn&#39;t an arbitrary thing. There was a reason for it, explained in terms they understood.<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Stressed out","postDate":"1243824344","msgId":40354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd2dmZjbytlaDhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2NDQ5Mi4yNDY1MS5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNi5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40350,"nextInTopic":40355,"prevInTime":40353,"nextInTime":40355,"topicId":40330,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I think I have idealized unschooling and think that it is going to make us all one big happy family.~~ It happens.;) A big, happy family includes conflict","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1594627915\">~~I think I have idealized unschooling and think that it is going to make us all one big happy family.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt happens.;)<br/>\nA big, happy family includes conflict and people being upset sometimes.

It doesn&#39;t work so well if your goal is to have a peaceful, respectful environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just did a talk at Life is Good about &quot;Perfect Imperfection&quot; in which the &quot;peace&quot; I refer to allows space for melt-downs and bickering.:) If peace is harmonious relationships, then part of that is trusting the process to harmony. Our children need space to learn about these things. If we don&#39;t resist the difficulties, if we can embrace them as part of our (and our childrens) development, then maybe it won&#39;t seem so overwhelming when those conflicts arise.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy, healthy families have upheaval, challenges and YES, disagreements. Maybe some people here have very quiet, compliant children and their families look to be the epitome of peace. Not mine!!! We can be noisy and boisterous and I have quite a mix of personalities. Noisy disagreement and resolutions are often a part of our dynamics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing ok with that process is part of it. Staying with the process shows respect to our children....reverting back to old tools is part of YOUR learning journey (as it is for all of us!) but each time you are faced with a choice of what to do in the moment of stress...breathe deep and BE right there with the ugly feelings. Be present for the feelings and recognize that in the moment of BEing with those feelings of frustration, you get a choice. Make a better choice each time and before long it starts to become natural.
