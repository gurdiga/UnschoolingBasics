I&#39;ve always supported her needs and wants though and <br/>\nI don&#39;t  push the school&#39;s agenda.  I believe it&#39;s all her choice and <br/>\nI do my  best to just be here for her as she needs me.  Her wish is <br/>\nto go to  culinary school and she likes the food & nutrition program <br/>\nat  school.  Her dad (we&#39;re divorced) wants her to be in AP classes <br/>\nand  preparing for college but she doesn&#39;t want that.

Grace is 15, and she decided finaly, to leave HS and be  home, <br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s a process, and it&#39;s ok. My older son, 18, did something  <br/>\nsimilar, and the basic guide, of deschooling taking place for about 1 month for  <br/>\neach year schooled was nearly dead-on with James :) After 13 months of no  <br/>\nschooling, he began really enjoying looking things up on his own, finding more  <br/>\ninterests and becoming fully himself. Grace is still in the process and I <br/>\nexpect  it to take some time. But your daughter could begin following those ideas <br/>\nif she  were NOT in school - but I know that&#39;s tough. Grace didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nleave school  because she has the (wrong) impression that homeschoolers were <br/>\n&quot;losers.&quot; It&#39;s  REALLY hard at times - her Dad wants to see her work, hold it in <br/>\nhis hands, get  reports from me, all of that - so it&#39;s a toughie, but we&#39;re <br/>\nfiguring it out.

Scrapbook implies some kind of product  <br/>\nto put into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJournaling is an excellent idea - just don&#39;t feel that what you  <br/>\njournal about has to be &quot;educational.&quot; Write things that the kids do,  <br/>\nlisten to, watch, talk about, visit, play, make, create, and so on.  <br/>\nAnd don&#39;t feel bad if, after a while, you no longer feel the need to  <br/>\nkeep it up.

I cant claim to be an experienced unschooler because my oldest is 8 but hopefully my experience will be somewhat relevant anyway. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  First I was honest with my 8 year old and told her if you choose to go back to school in 3rd or 4th or whenever they may consider you behind in some areas. This does not mean you are dumb in any way it simply means that you didnt study what the government decided you should study at a certain time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Unschooling imo dosent mean that one never uses a textbook of any kind. It just dosent in any way limit them to learing by textbooks. When I was 14 I left the us for a year as an exchange student in finland. During the year I traveled to many countries and did almost no schoolwork but wow it would take pages to describe all I experienced and learned. However, I came back to the US and was &quot;behind&quot; at school. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At 18 I decided I wanted to go to nursing school and spent about 9 days studying for the entrance exam. Me and my lovely d average in highschool aced it and I was accepted to one of 20 spots out of 200 applying that year. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My daughter decided to make muffins the other day. She thought the recipe said 1-2 cups of milk when it was actually calling for one half cup. She learned so much more about fractions that day than all the little worksheet shading exercises on fractions she has done. She also learned something I consider very valuable...mistakes are simply learning experiences and usualy not a big deal. We added more dry ingredients to make up for the extra milk and got a double batch of muffins. yum! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Do I worry that my kids will get behind? Yes there is always that nagging little voice in the back of my mind. Most if not all of us have been conditioned since childhood that we are supposed to follow the standard path....study what we are told no matter how uninteresting it is at that particular time , get good grades and go to college, enter into the standard hetrosexual marriage and have 2.2 children. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Another poster suggested taking it a year at a time. This is what we are doing right now. <br/>\n  Another thing Im starting is keeping a scrapbook and journal. I plan to use it to go back over the year and realize wow my kids did cover a lot and have something to show certain overconcerned family members that are sure to flip a lid when they find out we are unschooling. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One more thing ....this is something that Im working on with my own children right now so please dont take it as an attack. You gotta show your children that you truly trust them to learn what they need when they need/want to. If you get away from the books and they seem to do nothing but play x-box for 3 months and then you get back to the books they see mom is gonna let us have a break for a while but then she is gonna get all crazy on us again &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So sit back and relax. give help if they ask in the way they want the help. Offer help but prepared to step back if they decline. When the behind monster starts to show herslef feed her some choclate, bite your tongue, take up a new hobby and go read lots of unschooling stuff.

Then the anxieties you may<br/>\ncontinue to have about &quot;falling behind&quot; academically may be balanced<br/>\nby the liklihood that your dd will be &quot;getting ahead&quot; spiritually and<br/>\nemotionally.
