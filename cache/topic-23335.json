I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with him in principle, but in practice, many kids in the US are way better off in school than if they had no place but home with their parents -- or a nanny -- to spend their days.  That, and his position would completely turn off my inlaws, stripping him of all credibility, should they do any independent research on him.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

Professor Mark <br/>\nBlaug has observed that &quot;Conventional histories of education neatly dispose <br/>\nof the problem by simply ignoring the literacy evidence.&quot;5<br/>\n<br/>\nR. K. Webb, a specialist historian of literacy, offers the following <br/>\nconclusions about conditions in Britain in the late 1830s:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In so far as one dare generalize about a national average in an <br/>\nextraordinarily varied situation, the figure would seem to run between <br/>\ntwo-thirds and three-quarters of the working classes as literate, a group <br/>\nwhich included most of the respectable poor who were the great political <br/>\npotential in English life.6<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was, moreover, an appreciable rate of growth in literacy. This is <br/>\nreflected in the fact thatyoung persons were more and more accomplished than <br/>\ntheir elders. Thus an examination of educational attainments of males in the <br/>\nNavy and Marines in 1865 showed that 99 percent of the boys could read <br/>\ncompared with their seniors: seamen (89 percent), marines (80 percent), and <br/>\npetty officers (94 percent).7<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not surprising that with such evidence of literacy growth of young <br/>\npeople, the levels had become even more substantial by 1870. On my <br/>\ncalculations for 1880, when national compulsion was enacted, over 95 percent <br/>\nof fifteen-year-olds were literate.8 This should be compared to the fact <br/>\nthat over a century later 40 percent of 21-year- olds in the United Kingdom <br/>\nadmit to difficulties with writing and spelling.9<br/>\n<br/>\nwhich I got from here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=307\">http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=307</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if something there helps, but maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sylvia Toyama&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sylgt04@...\">sylgt04@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Saturday, April 21, 2007 4:22 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] literacy rates and compulsory schooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Gary & I have been talking about giving some more explanation/info<br/>\n&gt; about our &#39;homeschooling&#39; (we&#39;ve not yet said the &#39;U&#39; word) for his<br/>\n&gt; parents.
