Although she had a wonderfully loving teacher and room filled with so many things that encouraged learning, she was bored.  Despite what Montesorri claims, they can still only offer so much &quot;advance work&quot; and they still push children to grasp ideas that they may not be ready for.  I really believe the Waldorf philosophy that most children do not have all the skills necessary to read until around age 7.  It&#39;s like teaching a toddler to ride a two wheel bicycle when they haven&#39;t even mastered walking.  They need to be able to balance, stand well on one foot, be able to pedal their feet, and be able to do two things at the same time (pedal and steer).  Most toddlers can&#39;t do these things well.  That&#39;s why we give them tricycles or ride-on toys that they push with their feet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is still a lot of classroom competition.  For instance, a child who is behind his peers feels the pressure to catch up.  And the system is set up to make the &quot;next step&quot; seem better than the current one.  &quot;When you master addition and subtraction, then you can do *multiplication!*&quot;  And it is about mastering, not just attempting.  They have to show mastery in a subject before they move on.  I have a child that detests that sort of roteness to prove that she figured something out.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times in our ventures into schooling that I heard, &quot;Why do I have to do this over and over and over again to prove that I know how to do it?

We are strongly considering home schooling/unschooling for <br/>\n&gt; many, widely varied, reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Congrats, having a new baby is so exciting. It&#39;s nice to find <br/>\nunschooling at such an early time because you have plenty of time to <br/>\njust relax into it, read about it, etc.. The nicest thing about <br/>\nunschooling for us was that the excitement of watching all of our <br/>\nbabies&#39; earliest moments of learning - when they said their first <br/>\nwords and took their first steps - just continued and continued. As I <br/>\ntype this, I&#39;m listening to my 8 y.o. son pick out a Christmas carol <br/>\non the piano, something he&#39;s never been taught. The learning and <br/>\nexcitement just continue unabated if you let them. The best thing <br/>\nabout unschooling is that it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Several questions to you experienced unschoolers out there. First, <br/>\n&gt; where does one start? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is a great place. Just reading about unschooling, both books by <br/>\nfolks like John Holt or experiences of real life unschoolers is a <br/>\ngreat way to immerse yourself and begin to let go of the schoolish <br/>\nnotions in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that I mean, beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\n&gt; basic arithmetic. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They will teach themselves this stuff when they&#39;re ready. A child in <br/>\na home where books are joyfully read will want to read, just as a <br/>\nbaby in a house where people speak will want to speak. A child in a <br/>\nhome where arithmetic is used, whether it be for cooking or <br/>\ncalculating the total on a shopping list or the angle for a new <br/>\ncabinet, will want to know how it all works. They&#39;ll pick it up in <br/>\ndrips and drabs and before you know it, they can do it. You&#39;ll see as <br/>\nyour daughter learns and grows that there&#39;s very rarely a moment when <br/>\nsomething is learned or not learned. It&#39;s all a continuum. A baby <br/>\nbabbles and learns to make noises with their mouth - are they <br/>\ntalking? Then they repeat a sound that they know makes a <br/>\nword &quot;mamamamamama&quot; - is this talking? One day they point to <br/>\nsomething and say a real word (my daughter&#39;s was &quot;duck!&quot; after which <br/>\nshe called all birds ducks :-) - but is this talking? They add more <br/>\nand more and more words to their vocabulary and one day they string 2 <br/>\nwords together &quot;me milk!&quot;. Eventually they talk in complete sentences <br/>\nbut with limited vocabulary, and at some point you realize that their <br/>\nvocabulary is the equivalent of an adults. At what point on this <br/>\ncontinuum are they actually &quot;talking&quot;? Every step along the way is a <br/>\npart of the learning, and all of it is exciting to watch and be a <br/>\npart of and encourage. Right now, my daughter is sounding out every <br/>\nword she sees, from cereal boxes to book covers. She&#39;s in that <br/>\nprocess with reading and it&#39;s exciting to watch too. Some day, before <br/>\nI know it, she&#39;ll be picking up books and reading them, and I won&#39;t <br/>\nexactly be able to put my finger on the moment that she &quot;learned to <br/>\nread&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\n&gt; Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\n&gt; standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\n&gt; grade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\n&gt; requirements?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For us, it hasn&#39;t been a problem so far. Our son will do his 3rd <br/>\ngrade assessment next year and we&#39;re not worried about it. Though we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t sat down and done any kind of lessons, he can read, write, <br/>\nand do &#39;rithmatic, he&#39;s just picked it up along the way. I can&#39;t <br/>\nspeak to the yearly assessment as our state doesn&#39;t have that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>\n&gt; inevitable fit? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say anything for at least a few years. There&#39;s just <br/>\nnot much point if you know someone is going to be antagonistic about <br/>\nit. At 5 or 6 years, or even 7 (which is the compulsory attendance <br/>\nage in our state), you can just say that you&#39;re homeschooling. By <br/>\nthen, I&#39;m betting there will be even millions more homeschoolers than <br/>\nthere are now, and already it&#39;s not such an unusual thing. My mom (a <br/>\nformer educator) was fairly opposed at the first, but I always like <br/>\nto say &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;. Very few people, when they meet <br/>\nour interesting, engaging, and exuberant kids, could have any <br/>\nobjections to the way we&#39;re choose to unschool them. My parents <br/>\ndefinitely don&#39;t have any objections any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\n&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\n&gt; achievement?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>\ncase, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>\nthe year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>\ntwo school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>\nofficially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>\nwe might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>\n(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>\nclasses they offer are for older kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>\n&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>\n&gt; failing to follow the rules.  Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>\n&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>\nour state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>\nsend you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>\nthe worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>\nyour child has to go to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>\naspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>\non living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>\nlive and learn. Actually, that&#39;s great advice for the next couple of <br/>\ndecades!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies,<br/>\n-Robin-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

My bit of advise<br/>\nis to read some unschooling websites and lists like this one.  Let that lead<br/>\nyou to books that strike your fancy and also try to get to know some local<br/>\nfamilies who are doing it.  There&#39;s nothing like relationships with other<br/>\nunschoolers.  Our play group has families who&#39;s children are not &quot;school<br/>\nage&quot; and we don&#39;t think that&#39;s strange at all.  Also attachment parenting<br/>\nresources may be helpful to you at this stage in your lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have years before you have to be concerned about your state&#39;s laws -<br/>\nreally.

Bree&#39;s babyhood will be over in the<br/>\nblink of an eye and I urge you not to waste a minute away from her on the<br/>\nlegalities of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid declaring your unschooling status to people who might object (MIL, DS<br/>\netc.) after all, By the time they start asking about little Bree&#39;s schooling<br/>\nyears will have passed.

Your sense<br/>\nof responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>\ndepending on the decisions you make.  I felt just like you when my son<br/>\nDylan was born.  It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>\nright. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is you do have time.  The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>\neverything right.&lt;g&gt;  But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>\nmistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>\nand you&#39;ll do better the next time.   So my first advice to you is to<br/>\nrelax and enjoy your new baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***First, where does one start?***<br/>\n<br/>\nStart by assuming everything is all right.  Trust your daughter as a<br/>\nhuman being will want to do what humans do.   Be loving, generous with<br/>\nyour time, be willing to participate in her world.  Accept that she is<br/>\nand will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>\nor society.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>\nbeyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\nbasic arithmetic. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>\nlearn what you&#39;re teaching.   If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>\nare teaching resources galore.  I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot;  I hope you let<br/>\nher learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>\nwill show you.  She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>\nto books and the freedom to explore.  She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>\nwriting - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>\ndone.  She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>\nrecognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>\ntime is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>\nIt might take a month or it might take twelve years.  But because she<br/>\nlives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>\neverywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>\naccording to her nature.  Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>\nnow have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>\nbetter.  (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>\nor divide cookies fairly among friends.   If she finds math interesting<br/>\nshe&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it.   If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>\ntalents will be for other things. <br/>\n<br/>\n***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\nReading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\nstandardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\ngrade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\nrequirements?***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>\nyour area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>\nwrite about what Dylan has done.  I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>\nhave a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down.  So my calendar<br/>\nhas the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>\nsymphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>\nmuseum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>\ntournaments, and ...  Life won&#39;t let you down. &lt;g&gt;  You&#39;ll find your<br/>\nassessment material. <br/>\n<br/>\n***What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bye!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling.  You can<br/>\ntell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes.  You can tell them Bree can go<br/>\nto school if she wants to.   The less you talk to them about your<br/>\npersonal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch.  She&#39;s not their child<br/>\nand it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family.   You are<br/>\nnot required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot;  That was ok with the<br/>\nfamily members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>\nhappy and bright and not missing anything.  Compulsory school age is<br/>\nseven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet.  When he was six we said<br/>\n&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot;  That was still ok with the closer<br/>\nrelatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age.  Family members who<br/>\nlived elsewhere started to get nervous though.  At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot;   Those who saw Dylan<br/>\neveryday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>\nof things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>\ndoing those things if he was stuck at school.  This was when I started<br/>\ngetting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us.  They<br/>\nstarted sending articles about education.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>\nhim with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>\nthoughtful and engaged.   Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>\nneeded.   It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>\n<br/>\n***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\nhow do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\nachievement?***<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>\nnatural learner.  I hope you can really think about this.  A grade is a<br/>\njudgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>\nhelp anyone learn anything real.   Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>\nspirt crushing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>\nthe law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>\ncontinue to keep her out of school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>\nrequirements. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read different things.   Someone once said their child magically<br/>\n&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required.  So for two years she<br/>\nwas in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>\na state that doesn&#39;t require testing.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s nice to find <br/>\nunschooling at such an early time because you have plenty of time to <br/>\njust relax into it, read about it, etc.. The nicest thing about <br/>\nunschooling for us was that the excitement of watching all of our <br/>\nbabies&#39; earliest moments of learning - when they said their first <br/>\nwords and took their first steps - just continued and continued. As I <br/>\ntype this, I&#39;m listening to my 8 y.o. son pick out a Christmas carol <br/>\non the piano, something he&#39;s never been taught. The learning and <br/>\nexcitement just continue unabated if you let them. The best thing <br/>\nabout unschooling is that it&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Several questions to you experienced unschoolers out there. First, <br/>\n&gt; where does one start? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is a great place. Just reading about unschooling, both books by <br/>\nfolks like John Holt or experiences of real life unschoolers is a <br/>\ngreat way to immerse yourself and begin to let go of the schoolish <br/>\nnotions in your head.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that I mean, beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\n&gt; basic arithmetic. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They will teach themselves this stuff when they&#39;re ready. A child in <br/>\na home where books are joyfully read will want to read, just as a <br/>\nbaby in a house where people speak will want to speak. A child in a <br/>\nhome where arithmetic is used, whether it be for cooking or <br/>\ncalculating the total on a shopping list or the angle for a new <br/>\ncabinet, will want to know how it all works. They&#39;ll pick it up in <br/>\ndrips and drabs and before you know it, they can do it. You&#39;ll see as <br/>\nyour daughter learns and grows that there&#39;s very rarely a moment when <br/>\nsomething is learned or not learned. It&#39;s all a continuum. A baby <br/>\nbabbles and learns to make noises with their mouth - are they <br/>\ntalking? Then they repeat a sound that they know makes a <br/>\nword &quot;mamamamamama&quot; - is this talking? One day they point to <br/>\nsomething and say a real word (my daughter&#39;s was &quot;duck!&quot; after which <br/>\nshe called all birds ducks :-) - but is this talking? They add more <br/>\nand more and more words to their vocabulary and one day they string 2 <br/>\nwords together &quot;me milk!&quot;. Eventually they talk in complete sentences <br/>\nbut with limited vocabulary, and at some point you realize that their <br/>\nvocabulary is the equivalent of an adults. At what point on this <br/>\ncontinuum are they actually &quot;talking&quot;? Every step along the way is a <br/>\npart of the learning, and all of it is exciting to watch and be a <br/>\npart of and encourage. Right now, my daughter is sounding out every <br/>\nword she sees, from cereal boxes to book covers. She&#39;s in that <br/>\nprocess with reading and it&#39;s exciting to watch too. Some day, before <br/>\nI know it, she&#39;ll be picking up books and reading them, and I won&#39;t <br/>\nexactly be able to put my finger on the moment that she &quot;learned to <br/>\nread&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\n&gt; Reading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\n&gt; standardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\n&gt; grade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\n&gt; requirements?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For us, it hasn&#39;t been a problem so far. Our son will do his 3rd <br/>\ngrade assessment next year and we&#39;re not worried about it. Though we <br/>\nhaven&#39;t sat down and done any kind of lessons, he can read, write, <br/>\nand do &#39;rithmatic, he&#39;s just picked it up along the way. I can&#39;t <br/>\nspeak to the yearly assessment as our state doesn&#39;t have that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>\n&gt; inevitable fit? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say anything for at least a few years. There&#39;s just <br/>\nnot much point if you know someone is going to be antagonistic about <br/>\nit. At 5 or 6 years, or even 7 (which is the compulsory attendance <br/>\nage in our state), you can just say that you&#39;re homeschooling. By <br/>\nthen, I&#39;m betting there will be even millions more homeschoolers than <br/>\nthere are now, and already it&#39;s not such an unusual thing. My mom (a <br/>\nformer educator) was fairly opposed at the first, but I always like <br/>\nto say &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot;. Very few people, when they meet <br/>\nour interesting, engaging, and exuberant kids, could have any <br/>\nobjections to the way we&#39;re choose to unschool them. My parents <br/>\ndefinitely don&#39;t have any objections any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\n&gt; how do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\n&gt; achievement?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can choose to decide however it will benefit her the best. In our <br/>\ncase, we chose the latest grade that we could, because it would delay <br/>\nthe year that our kids will be tested. Our son is on the cusp between <br/>\ntwo school years, and we chose the earlier one (so right now, he&#39;s <br/>\nofficially in &quot;2nd grade&quot;). For a local homeschool resource center, <br/>\nwe might choose 3rd grade if he wants to get into a particular class <br/>\n(he&#39;s very into robotics right now, for instance, and the robotics <br/>\nclasses they offer are for older kids).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>\n&gt; her future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>\n&gt; failing to follow the rules.  Any advice, resources, etc. that you <br/>\n&gt; folks can recommend would be gratefully received.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about jail. I know at least that in <br/>\nour state if you&#39;re out of compliance with the homeschool rules, they <br/>\nsend you a letter and you just have to get *in* compliance. I think <br/>\nthe worst thing that could happen would be that they would mandate <br/>\nyour child has to go to school. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got many years before you have to worry about any of the legal <br/>\naspects - probably at least 6 or 7. Right now, I&#39;d just concentrate <br/>\non living in the moment, enjoying your daughter, and watching her <br/>\nlive and learn.

Your sense<br/>\nof responsibility is overwhelmed with the realization there is a life<br/>\ndepending on the decisions you make.  I felt just like you when my son<br/>\nDylan was born.  It seems like there isn&#39;t enough time to get everything<br/>\nright. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe good news is you do have time.  The bad news is you won&#39;t get<br/>\neverything right.&lt;g&gt;  But even the bad news isn&#39;t all bad because in your<br/>\nmistakes you&#39;ll be learning something about yourself and your daughter<br/>\nand you&#39;ll do better the next time.   So my first advice to you is to<br/>\nrelax and enjoy your new baby.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***First, where does one start?***<br/>\n<br/>\nStart by assuming everything is all right.  Trust your daughter as a<br/>\nhuman being will want to do what humans do.   Be loving, generous with<br/>\nyour time, be willing to participate in her world.  Accept that she is<br/>\nand will be her own person and doesn&#39;t need to be shaped or molded by you<br/>\nor society.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By that I mean,<br/>\nbeyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\nbasic arithmetic. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can &quot;teach&quot; them any way you want to but that doesn&#39;t mean she will<br/>\nlearn what you&#39;re teaching.   If you want to know how to &quot;teach&quot; there<br/>\nare teaching resources galore.  I hope you don&#39;t &quot;teach.&quot;  I hope you let<br/>\nher learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know how your daughter will learn, that&#39;s something she<br/>\nwill show you.  She will learn to read by being read to, by having access<br/>\nto books and the freedom to explore.  She&#39;ll learn by experimenting with<br/>\nwriting - she&#39;ll write jumbles of letters and be pleased about what she&#39;s<br/>\ndone.  She&#39;ll pretend to read and be very satisfied. She&#39;ll start to<br/>\nrecognize letters and remember where she saw them before and when the<br/>\ntime is right for her it will all come together and she&#39;ll begin to read.<br/>\n It might take a month or it might take twelve years.  But because she<br/>\nlives with people who read, in a world where written language is<br/>\neverywhere, she&#39;ll learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll write when she has a reason to and she&#39;ll spell well or poorly<br/>\naccording to her nature.  Enough people had trouble spelling well that we<br/>\nnow have spell check and other wondrous things to help us communicate<br/>\nbetter.  (Like telephones! No spelling!)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll learn about math when she wants to buy toys, keep score in a game<br/>\nor divide cookies fairly among friends.   If she finds math interesting<br/>\nshe&#39;ll look for ways to learn more about it.   If she doesn&#39;t, maybe her<br/>\ntalents will be for other things. <br/>\n<br/>\n***My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\nReading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\nstandardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\ngrade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\nrequirements?***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require testing but if you can find other unschoolers in<br/>\nyour area and talk with them I&#39;m sure they have strategies.<br/>\nMy state doesn&#39;t require yearly assessments either but I could easily<br/>\nwrite about what Dylan has done.  I have a huge calendar and because I<br/>\nhave a mind like a steel sieve, I write everything down.  So my calendar<br/>\nhas the dates we went to the punkin&#39; chunkin, and the dog show and the<br/>\nsymphony. I have notations about hikes and fossil hunting expeditions and<br/>\nmuseum visits and art gallery tours and clay classes and martial arts<br/>\ntournaments, and ...  Life won&#39;t let you down. &lt;g&gt;  You&#39;ll find your<br/>\nassessment material. <br/>\n<br/>\n***What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the inevitable fit?<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Bye!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  You can tell them you&#39;re considering homeschooling.  You can<br/>\ntell them you&#39;re going to see how it goes.  You can tell them Bree can go<br/>\nto school if she wants to.   The less you talk to them about your<br/>\npersonal decisions the fewer fits they can pitch.  She&#39;s not their child<br/>\nand it&#39;s not their place to make decisions about your family.   You are<br/>\nnot required by law to let them fling the poo of negativity on you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe said &quot;Dylan doesn&#39;t want to go to kindergarten.&quot;  That was ok with the<br/>\nfamily members who were living near us because they could see he was<br/>\nhappy and bright and not missing anything.  Compulsory school age is<br/>\nseven here, so they weren&#39;t in panic mode yet.  When he was six we said<br/>\n&quot;He doesn&#39;t want to go to school.&quot;  That was still ok with the closer<br/>\nrelatives because he wasn&#39;t compulsory school age.  Family members who<br/>\nlived elsewhere started to get nervous though.  At seven he didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto go to school so we finally said &quot;homeschool.&quot;   Those who saw Dylan<br/>\neveryday were ok with it because they knew we were busy doing all kinds<br/>\nof things and most of them were smart enough to realize he&#39;d never be<br/>\ndoing those things if he was stuck at school.  This was when I started<br/>\ngetting letters from concerned relatives who did not live near us.  They<br/>\nstarted sending articles about education.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a hassle for awhile but as Dylan got older those who would compare<br/>\nhim with their schooled children found a kid who was smart, interested,<br/>\nthoughtful and engaged.   Dylan himself became the reassurance they<br/>\nneeded.   It will be that way with your daughter too. <br/>\n<br/>\n***If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\nhow do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\nachievement?***<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically grades don&#39;t matter, they mean nothing to a life long,<br/>\nnatural learner.  I hope you can really think about this.  A grade is a<br/>\njudgement about another persons learning and it has never and can never<br/>\nhelp anyone learn anything real.   Grades (and tests) are dangerous and<br/>\nspirt crushing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since your state requires testing, and if you intend to comply with<br/>\nthe law, ask other unschoolers how they&#39;ve done it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome places let you pick the test and the test results don&#39;t matter. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have any bearing, according to the law, on whether you can<br/>\ncontinue to keep her out of school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people join umbrella schools that can help unschoolers with testing<br/>\nrequirements. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have read different things.   Someone once said their child magically<br/>\n&quot;skipped&quot; those grades where testing was required.  So for two years she<br/>\nwas in &quot;second grade&quot; and then she &quot;jumped ahead&quot; to fourth.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are opposed to the concept of testing in general you could move to<br/>\na state that doesn&#39;t require testing.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184085618,"authorName":"jeff_legrange","from":"&quot;jeff_legrange&quot; &lt;jeff_legrange@...&gt;","profile":"jeff_legrange","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Newbie with a relatively clean slate.","postDate":"1102299258","msgId":4223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNwMGY5cStqcHBoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4221,"nextInTopic":4226,"prevInTime":4222,"nextInTime":4224,"topicId":4214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your reply, Robyn.

Regarding your question about how to &quot;teach&quot; her the fundamentals, let me assure you that unschooling works.  You will soon see your dd&#39;s innate drive to learn and its strength.  Trust it.  She will learn everything that she needs to learn.  You will be able to help her by answering her questions, showing her how to seek answers on her own.  You will not ever need to introduce her to topics for which she hasn&#39;t expressed an interest.  If you haven&#39;t devoured Sandra Dodd&#39;s site yet, I encourage you to do so, and I am sure many others will do the same.  The beauty of unschooling is that you relax and trust that learning is inevitable.  My own ds, always unschooled, is not yet three, and he is already entirely literate, reading well, nearly as fast as I do and including extremely long or<br/>\n difficult words...he also has broad knowledge in diverse fields:  I would go so far as to call him an expert on the Solar System, rocks and minerals, and mushrooms; and he is intimate w maps on all levels from the geological survey of our immediate area to the map of the world and can id most of the US states and over half of the countries of the world.  He is computer literate as well.  This is all from following his own interests and having his questions answered (from the time he could point at everything and only say &quot;Dis?&quot;), and I assure you I have never once sat him down and said &quot;Okay, son, let&#39;s learn about x now.&quot;    My only part in this, aside from as I said, answering many questions, has been reading to him whenever he desired.  I have also done some strewing; I purchased the Children&#39;s World Atlas after I noticed him studying a map in a waiting area, and have made other such purchases...he is always welcome to do what he likes with these materials (and he does choose to<br/>\n study them).  But it is important for me to not value his reading the atlas, say, over playing on the computer, or watching TV, as there is tremendous value and learning opportunities in every aspect of life.<br/>\n   Jeff, I would like to advise you to not concern yourself much with your state laws at this point.  I understand why you are concerned and interested, and I myself felt this way.  But there are several years before your child is of compulsary school age, and in that time these standards needn&#39;t concern you at all (and then of course there are many years beyond that before she would be &quot;3rd grade&quot; age).  The thing is, states&#39; laws change.  Homeschooling is becoming more and more widespread and accepted and you may find that the laws in your state are totally different once your child reaches that age.  You will be able to unschool your daughter wherever you live and you will be able to figure out the best way to deal w your state when that time comes.  When I started researching states laws I didn&#39;t know that I would be living in a different state now (so all that research was really pointless).  But, I did happen to research the laws of the state where I now reside, as it was<br/>\n bordering my own.  At that time, in this state (MS), the laws stated that to homeschool your children you needed to be a certified tutor and submit all sorts of records and logs, etc.  Now (less than 3 years later) this state has one of the most relaxed homeschooling laws and all a parent must do is send in a note once a year stating the children&#39;s names and that they will homeschool.<br/>\nAnyway, Jeff, enjoy your daughter and be amazed as you watch her learn every day of her life.  You don&#39;t have to teach her; your job is to protect her freedom and allow the relaxed environment where learning comes easily.<br/>\nGood luck on your journey together!<br/>\nMillie<br/>\nby the riverside<br/>\n <br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Yahoo!

My wife <br/>\nand I are both products of the public education system; in fact, my <br/>\nwife went through the school system in the county where we now <br/>\nreside. We both HATED &quot;school&quot;: I did well, however, and went on to <br/>\na bachelor&#39;s degree. My wife didn&#39;t do so well in school, dropping <br/>\nout in her senior year and took a GED. I love to read for pleasure, <br/>\nJane can barely stand to read a magazine article or a cookbook <br/>\nrecipe. Emails and/or something she really wants to know are her <br/>\nlimits. (She can read well; to the college level - she just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike to.) I am firmly of the opinion that most of the things I know <br/>\nof lasting value, were all learned independently; outside the <br/>\ntraditional educational system, and that learning is an unending <br/>\nprocess. We are already convinced that public education generally, <br/>\nand our county school system particularly, is no place for our <br/>\ndarling Bree.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are Christians, but not of the fundamentalist/born-again stripe. <br/>\nWe are generally politically conservative, but we both have a good <br/>\nmix of liberal beliefs thrown in. I am the high-speed, low-drag, <br/>\nuber-organized type; Jane is the start-slow and taper off type, <br/>\nbelieving that most things take care of themselves. All in all, I&#39;d <br/>\nlike to think we are just average folks.  My sister is a Montessori <br/>\nteacher, so we have some knowledge of non-traditional educational <br/>\nmodels; AND their better than average results. My parents are <br/>\ncomfortable with non-traditional methods; hers are the Ozzie and <br/>\nHarriet types right out of the 1950&#39;s - we can expect SERIOUS <br/>\nopposition from them if we don&#39;t stick Bree in the local elementary <br/>\nschool/daycare depot, have bedtimes, or allow her to eat <br/>\nwhatever/whenever she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral questions to you experienced unschoolers out there. First, <br/>\nwhere does one start? How do we &quot;teach&quot; the basic fundamentals? By <br/>\nthat I mean, beyond-bedtime-story reading, spelling, writing, and <br/>\nbasic arithmetic. My state requires a yearly written assessment of <br/>\nReading, Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies, and <br/>\nstandardized testing every three years starting at the end of third <br/>\ngrade.  How does the unschooling model conform to these <br/>\nrequirements?  What  do we say to Jane&#39;s parents when they pitch the <br/>\ninevitable fit? If unschooling is a year-round, lifelong process, <br/>\nhow do we decide what grade she is in; by age or by academic <br/>\nachievement?<br/>\n<br/>\nOur goal is a healthy, happy, well-adjusted daughter, unlimited in <br/>\nher future prospects - while keeping Mom and Dad out of jail for <br/>\nfailing to follow the rules.
