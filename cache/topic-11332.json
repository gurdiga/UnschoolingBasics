(I suspect the  <br/>\nanswer is no, but just in case you really do have an extra room....)   That&#39;s a big <br/>\ndevelopmental range, a seven year old and a toddler. If Drew  doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nshare that space, he will probably like his little brother a lot  more. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf not, why do they have to be in the bedroom? Could Drew find another  place <br/>\nin the house to read or play quietly? And it sounds like Josh really wants  <br/>\nto be playing with someone during that time, and he teases Drew to try to <br/>\nengage  him. Right on developmentally, but irritating to Drew.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not a big Bedtime advocate, but maybe for a little while for the sake  of <br/>\nyour family a quiet bedtime routine for Josh is in order. You say you need  <br/>\nsome downtime after a busy day with active Josh, and so does Drew. So maybe <br/>\nDrew  stays up reading or playing quietly in the living room, and you can give <br/>\nJosh  some mellowing time to get sleepy and settle in with stories, etc. Maybe <br/>\nthat  would be a good task for another parent, if one is around? You could have <br/>\nsome  quiet time with Drew and your partner some with Josh? If there isn&#39;t <br/>\nanother  parent around, that routine and a (temporary, until Josh is really <br/>\nready for  quiet time by himself) earlier bedtime for him might be especially <br/>\nimportant.  It&#39;s better for Josh to have a sane mommy, and that bedtime routine <br/>\ncould turn  out to be some of your happiest memories, and his.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n*******************<br/>\nIn a message dated 4/6/2006 4:30:34 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re  slowly slipping into an unschooling mindset over here, but there are<br/>\ndozens  of things that aren&#39;t there yet.

But just a thought, could you put Josh to sleep in his bed and let Drew sit quietly somewhere else until he&#39;s ready to go to sleep? We have a quiet/comfy area out in the hallway where people can do this. However,I am pretty strong about bedtimes around here,because I see that ds&#39;s(5.5 and 3) could stay up alot later and then it really affects their behavior the next day (sometimes for days afterward,weeks, and no I&#39;m not kidding-- one late night can have a bad effect for a couple of months for my older son!)
