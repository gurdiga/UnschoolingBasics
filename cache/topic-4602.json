A little &quot;schooly,&quot; but he&#39;d *just* left school,  <br/>\nso it didn&#39;t seem so bad at the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was about $5,000---I think. But that included transportation  (from <br/>\nAtlanta to LA and then Quantas to Sidney, with first class tour  busses throughout <br/>\nAustralia), hotels (actually resorts----first class all the  way), all meals <br/>\n(which Cameron said were great), chaperones, and day-trips. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey flew into Sidney and then flew up to the Great Barrier Reef. They  <br/>\nsnorkled in the Reef. They wandered beaches. They spent two nights with  a family <br/>\nin a &quot;home stay&quot; and two nights on a &quot;farm stay.&quot;  They  got to visit a <br/>\nsanctuary: we have photos of Cameron holding a  koala and a wombat and feeding a <br/>\nkangaroo and lorikeets. They spent one night  under an aquarium. They took a boat <br/>\ntour around Sidney and saw an opera at the  Opera House. They went to the new <br/>\nOlympic stadium just a few weeks before  the Games started.<br/>\n <br/>\nP2P used to have trips all OVER the world, but I think they&#39;ve cut waaay  <br/>\nback.

I&#39;ll pull out his scrapbook from his  trip. <br/>\nHe made a lot of good friends---he still keeps in touch with two of  them. He <br/>\nsaw one of his chaperones, who was from San Antonio, when we were at  the <br/>\nArch in St Louis the October after got went. She was there for a middle  school <br/>\nteacher convention! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nThey take 40 kids with four chaperones. We didn&#39;t have that many signed up  <br/>\nhere, so they combined with a group from TX. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt was a really good trip. He came back with so much confidence. They give  <br/>\nsome really good ideas, too, to help raise money for the trip.
