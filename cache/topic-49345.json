Grrr. As slow as things are otherwise, I&#39;m tempted to switch the entire membership to moderation. As it is, anyone who posts blanket emails to the list goes on moderation, if they&#39;re not already (everyone starts out on moderation which cuts down some of this) and if anyone posts really blatant advertizing they&#39;re removed from the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, if for some reason you want to reply to an off-topic post, do it directly to the poster, not the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, and my appologies again,<br/>\nMeredith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49307,"nextTopicId":49333}}
