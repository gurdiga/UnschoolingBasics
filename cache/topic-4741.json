I do understand the principles of unschooling.<br/>\nThey will learn when they want what they want. When I was a child <br/>\n(heck I am still like that!)I used to read entire enciclopedias and <br/>\ndo math on work books for fun during the holidays.<br/>\nI just wished my mom had unschooled me. In a way she help me be open <br/>\nto it.<br/>\nI learned so much more outside of school. And its not to say I did <br/>\nnot like school. I loved it. But always tought it was a waste of time <br/>\nall those hours there. ( So I usually read a book during class- Had <br/>\nto hide it of course) I had great grades and I have a JD (Graduaded <br/>\nfrom Law School). Well I just wanted to clarify that.<br/>\nI am just trying to learn more here (already read great info on past <br/>\nposts).<br/>\nThe other thing that might be a little different is that I live in <br/>\nthe US and my son is bilingual. Dad is American. So my son speaks <br/>\nboth Portuguese and English. Any good info on unschooling bilingual <br/>\nchildren?<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\nAlex</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4731,"nextTopicId":4744}}
