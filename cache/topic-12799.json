Here&#39;s the recipe:  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  2 cups white flour (not self-rising)<br/>\n  1/2 cp table salt<br/>\n  1 cp hot tap water<br/>\n  1 tsp cooking oil (optional - makes dough more pliable)<br/>\n  glitter (optional - for sparkly play dough)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  In large bowl, mix flour and salt.  Slowly mix in water (and oil) while stirring.  When stirring gets difficult, use your hand to knead in the bowl.  When you get all the flour off the sides of the bowl and have one neat dough ball, dump it out and and continue kneading until desired consistency.  You might have to add quite a bit of extra flour (1/4 to 1/2 cupor more) until the stickiness disappears.  The entire stirring/kneading process takes about 5 minutes.  Divide into as many balls as colors you&#39;d like.  Use paint or food coloring to color the balls or just leave them plain.  Store at room temp in zip lock bags.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Fwiw, I&#39;m sincerely dough making challenged (yep, even when it comes to bread!!) and I can make this dough no trouble.  Also, since all of the ingredients are edible to begin with, there&#39;s concern about it being toxic to really small people.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  HTH!! <br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJane Powell <br/>\nTribe Commander <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;If you bungle raising your children, I don&#39;t think anything you do well matters very much.&quot;   Jackie O <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;The most wasted day is that in which we have not laughed.&quot; - Sebastien-Roch Chamfort<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap.
