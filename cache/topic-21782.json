When i consider my fears it makes me more assured that <br/>\nunschooling is the right way to go.  It doesn&#39;t mean i am a perfect parent <br/>\nall the time.  Facing my doubts head on ultimately builds strength in my <br/>\nconvictions.  (see below copy of my posting about doubts from regional <br/>\nunschooling list).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that when I turn to people for advice who seem to always be 100% <br/>\nconfident, on the one hand I appreciate their advice but on the other I <br/>\nbegin to wonder if they just have such easy children that whatever they did <br/>\nalways &quot;worked&quot;.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if my kids are easy but it has always worked!!!!  We have <br/>\nunschooled right from the beginning so maybe that&#39;s why our relationships <br/>\nare what they are - maybe not - your right i wouldn&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are, however, different challenges we&#39;ve faced with each child...or <br/>\nrather each child in their own way has challenged us to be different or (as <br/>\nMerideth so aptly put it) be better people.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny how when my oldest dd was young, family and friends had very strong <br/>\nfeelings about how i responded to her.  They seemed to think of her as a <br/>\nchallenge and that i was not in control.  For me control wasn&#39;t my intention <br/>\n- though they still don&#39;t necessarily understand this perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt appeared to others that she was the challenge...i had a very different <br/>\nperception then of her and the situation and now that she&#39;s 13.5 the same <br/>\nfolks seem to have an entirely different perception of her as well and for <br/>\nthe most part a different regard for how i parent.  They don&#39;t voice out <br/>\nloud the same concerns in my response to my very active and busy 8 yo.  <br/>\nHowever, new concerns about how i am doing things are being voiced...as my <br/>\n13.5 yo still doesn&#39;t do what other kids in school her age are doing.  <br/>\nComparing my kids &#39;academic&#39; learning to schooled kids doesn&#39;t work - just <br/>\nas comparing their socialization skills and other personality traits to my <br/>\nkids wouldn&#39;t hold muster either (imho).<br/>\n<br/>\nso what is &#39;working&#39; anyway.  i am always amazed by the kids who have been <br/>\nlabeled &#39;difficult&#39; as being extrodinary in their enthusiasm, energy, <br/>\ncreativity, etc.etcl.etc...of course now i&#39;m generalizing as well &lt;g&gt;.  but <br/>\ni love being with these &#39;difficult&#39; kids..they keep me humble and alive and <br/>\nconscious of the miracles of uniqueness in each individual.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\nmy posting from another unschooling list.:<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving doubts can be a good thing as it makes us question ourselves and<br/>\nreevaluate our choices. Just so you know your human, even veteran seemingly<br/>\nsecure unschoolers can sometimes have doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy doubts often come from comparing myself to others. However, when i <br/>\nquestion<br/>\nif i am doing right by kids, i look at them and ask myself - are they happy?<br/>\nare they secure? are they thriving? what do i need to be doing differently <br/>\nto<br/>\nfacilitate them better? The answer has never been to put them in school. And<br/>\nit&#39;s never to impose anything on them that they do not ask for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes they see others doing something and wonder if it would work for <br/>\nthem.<br/>\nWe discuss it. We may try it. But often if they are insecure and doubting <br/>\nwhat<br/>\nwe are doing in relation to others its time for a discussion about <br/>\ndifferences<br/>\nbetween people and making our own choices and why we are doing what we are<br/>\ndoing. i think its important for the kids to understand why they are <br/>\nparented<br/>\nthe way they are and to get their feedback. And it may also be time to <br/>\nsurround<br/>\nthem (and myself) with like minded folks so i/we don&#39;t feel so weird - as in<br/>\ntruth we are so very different than the norm that being involved in the real<br/>\nworld we are confronted with our differences constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n(We just came back from a three day road trip...stopping in CT for a <br/>\ngathering<br/>\nof unschoolers on the way to staying over night with unschooling friends in <br/>\nMA<br/>\nfor two days).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat exactly are you having doubts about? If you don&#39;t mind, it would be<br/>\nhelpful to share your concerns so that we can respond specifically. I have a<br/>\n13yo and 8yo (both girls) and they have always unschooled and always learned <br/>\nin<br/>\ntheir own way at their own pace (it is very different than what we are<br/>\nconditioned to believe as what&#39;s supposed to be or look like).<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nPlay Flexicon: the crossword game that feeds your brain.
