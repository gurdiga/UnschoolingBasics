It&#39;s got to be <br/>\nconfusing for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family (dad in particular) also think that teasing children until <br/>\nthey cry is fun.  I had to put a stop to that fast!  It&#39;s easier to <br/>\ndo with my family because I can simply say cut it out or we won&#39;t <br/>\ncome visit anymore! With a husband, not so easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would try to explain to him that his behavior is harming his <br/>\nrelationship with his son, and that even if he can&#39;t see it now, <br/>\nthere will likely be implications down the road.  What seems like <br/>\ninnocent fun to him is not fun at all for your son.  Your son needs <br/>\nto see his father as someone he can depend on, as someone he can <br/>\ncount on to help him meet his needs and to take care of him.  He <br/>\nneeds to be able to TRUST his father.  This kind of thing undermines <br/>\nthat feeling of trust and sets up a situation where, from the child&#39;s <br/>\npoint of view, the father, his father, is simply not trustworthy, not <br/>\ndependable, and who can&#39;t be counted on.  I think this kind of thing <br/>\nmakes deep changes to the level of security the child feels with the <br/>\nfather and can possibly cause the child to withdraw emotionally from <br/>\nhis father.  That&#39;s not cool.  What must your son be <br/>\nthinking/feeling - daddy will give me something nice but not until I <br/>\ncry!  How awful and how confusing emotionally for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo out and buy your dh a present.  Something nice.  Tell him you <br/>\nbought it.  Hide it in the house.  Don&#39;t let him know where it is.  <br/>\nTease him about it constantly, day after day.  Boy, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll <br/>\nreally love what I got you!  I&#39;ll bet you wish you could have it.  <br/>\nAnd don&#39;t give it to him until he cries!  That should teach him.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184269211,"authorName":"rebecca de","from":"rebecca de &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt;","profile":"rebeccadehate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] I feel something is wrong here","postDate":"1212589844","msgId":33476,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5MDU5NS4zNTI3MC5xbUB3ZWI1NjExMS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMTYwMWM4YzY0NyRmMzljZGIyMCQ2NDAyYThjMEB5b3VydzA0Z3R4bGQ2Nz4="},"prevInTopic":33469,"nextInTopic":33495,"prevInTime":33475,"nextInTime":33477,"topicId":33469,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Not only is that kind of cruel!!
