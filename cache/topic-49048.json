He wants to play on it as we want to enjoy it. We have spoke about a separate t.v. Not an option right now. Maybe later. He is really good about taking a break most times, but not all the time. He is also on the Autism spec. very high functioning, sometimes talking to him can be a challenge. He has a hard time understanding things at times. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nKasey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Pre-teen help","postDate":"1347989575","msgId":49052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGszYWI4NytxNnBiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxODA2RDMwLTE4OEItNDMwMy1BNzQ1LUZGMzhFNjRGOTlBREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":49051,"nextInTopic":49053,"prevInTime":49051,"nextInTime":49053,"topicId":49048,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Good point!

You&#39;ve said they&#39;re interested in rock climbing and DJing - look for ideas along those lines. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t afford a rock climbing class, but you might be able to rig a simple climbing wall at home, or look into local places to do easy, no-ropes climbing. And you can look into similar kinds of activities - things which involve big muscle groups and have an element of challenge/danger. That might be skating, setting up a slack line or zip line or trapeze. It might be playing with fire poi. It might be playing paintball. It might be spelunking. But strew those kinds of things, not books and board games.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat interests them about DJing? Are they looking to do some sampling and mixing? Look into some cheap recording equipment - go to pawn shops! They&#39;re often great for cheap electronics. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it could be they&#39;re telling you they&#39;re interested in things you&#39;ll automatically say no to in order to get you off their backs. When my stepson was 13 he spent most of his time playing Runescape. Now, at 19, he&#39;s more often off in the woods with no utilities at all than anywhere near a computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the wonderful things about unschooling is that it lets kids have Time - time to really delve into their interests in big ways. That can include taking time to delve into the wonderful complexity of video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;it is becoming a point of contention with the family especially when someone else wants to use the T.V.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nAn actual used TV set is pretty cheap.

Or are you worried because you don&#39;t have information about the dangers of the seizures and are projecting the worst you can imagine?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there breaks during the games? Levels? End of missions? Talk to them about taking breaks because you&#39;re concerned about the increase in seizures. And then be aware of when the breaks are coming up and have something fun for them to do for a few minutes. Cookie break. Shooting some baskets. Ask them for suggestions. Be the orchestrator. Don&#39;t leave it up to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might talk to the 11 year old separately about supporting you in taking breaks. *Not* to put the burden on him, but so he doesn&#39;t undermine your suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is so much in the world that I want to share with them but <br/>\n&gt; at this age for us, I am not seeing the same enthusiasm as I did a few years back.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;To every thing there is a season.&quot; Just as they drifted from interest in the world to video games, so they will drift from video games to something else.

There is so much in the world that I want to share with them but at this age for us, I am not seeing the same enthusiasm as I did a few years back. I love video games and t.v as much as they do. I play with them as much as I can and get involved but it is becoming a point of contention with the family especially when someone else wants to use the T.V.  They can play from 8-12 hours a day at times. Maybe I am seeign it all wrong..   <br/>\n We are part of a few groups locally but they have outgrown park days(their words) and there is not much else in the groups outside of the occasional field trip that is going on. <br/>\n We are on a budget a fairly tight one so a few of the things that they want to do we can not afford at the moment.. ie rock climbing classes or getting DJ equipment. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening.. really struggling here and trying to keep peace in the home. <br/>\n<br/>\nKasey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49009,"nextTopicId":28085}}
