For that matter, so will grammar! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter does a fair amount of writing. Sometimes she&#39;ll ask me to read over what she writes because she wants to share something with me, other times she wants input because she&#39;s planning on other people seeing it - a sign, a card, a game walkthrough, a comic strip or story. All of those take a different kind of writing - she knows that, no-one needed to teach her what kind of style one uses for a game walkthrough versus a comic strip, and she didn&#39;t need to &quot;work on&quot; those skills in the sense of inventing reasons to write. She has reasons to write - and because the Reasons are important to her, she cares about the results. If she&#39;s writing for someone else then she wants to be understood - and because of that, sometimes she&#39;ll ask me for feedback: how is this? does the writing do what it&#39;s intended to do? And then I can point out things like punctuation and spacing, talk about fonts and pitch, let her know the spell checker doesn&#39;t catch mistakes like witch/which or their/there/they&#39;re.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she doesn&#39;t think of any of that as &quot;working on writing skills&quot; - she&#39;s writing, really writing for real reasons of her own - and like other writers she cares about her potential readers. Skills grow out of that care. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: My 7-year old really wants some penpals...","postDate":"1338829979","msgId":48588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyM0I5RkQzLTEzMTAtNDBERS04RUNGLTk2QjVEODM2MDAwOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpxaWZ0NysydWJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpxaWZ0NysydWJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48587,"nextInTopic":48593,"prevInTime":48587,"nextInTime":48589,"topicId":48564,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
