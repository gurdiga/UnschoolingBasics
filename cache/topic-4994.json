It&#39;s a long story but is wrapped <br/>\nup in some very oogey thought patterns by the school administration <br/>\nand security (like not being able to recognize metaphors!)  Anyway, <br/>\nthe school now considers them &quot;homeschooled&quot; and I would love to <br/>\nfind a good supportive non-judgemental group (or family) for them to <br/>\nbe involved with in the Tulsa area (they actually live in Jenks).  I <br/>\nreally think her dd would be fantastic as an unschooler.  She has a <br/>\nwonderfully creative mind and is very expressive.  She just has a <br/>\nproblem with authority ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4947,"nextTopicId":4996}}
