But it was my 8 year old daughter that felt like she was suffocating.  She never felt safe there because she was bullied and teased so badly because of her small size.  Then add that she always felt stressed there, and she did feel like it was chaotic.  So she shut down, and no learning was occurring for her.  I am so thankfully I listened to her.  She came home everyday for a month and told me that she was done with the place, and wanted to be homeschooled.  She is happy and thriving now!
