I don&#39;t want my daughter to be<br/>\nwithout guidance because I see the irreversable dicisions I made<br/>\nunder this type of parenting. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStick around...you&#39;ll see many examples that show just how involved <br/>\nand focused these unschooling parents are.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children trust my guidance because it isn&#39;t offered up with <br/>\npunishment. I DO believe in being an example and I don&#39;t control <br/>\nanything that doesn&#39;t need controlling. They are free to be who they <br/>\nare, but they also know I&#39;m totally available.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get a bit coercive if anyone is trying to harm themselves or <br/>\nothers....and occasionally the house is SO disgusting, that I&#39;ll be <br/>\na bit more forward than usual. &quot;I have to have help today, when can <br/>\nyou help me out?&quot; might happen if I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed. Not &quot;WILL <br/>\nyou help me?&quot; but &quot;WHEN will you help me?&quot; :)<br/>\nThey have so much freedom and lead such happy lives overall, that <br/>\nthey&#39;re really very receptive when I reach that point.<br/>\nI try to always help them with everything....bringing drinks and <br/>\nfood to each other (rather than the &quot;get it yourself&quot; that I often <br/>\ngot as a child or &quot;your legs look healthy to me&quot;), helping each <br/>\nother clean or cook or many other kindnesses that help this family <br/>\nbe more peaceful.<br/>\nThere are crabby/tense moments, we&#39;re all human. But the unschooling <br/>\nphilosophies have changed our lives dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about leaving kids to figure things out on their own, and <br/>\nit&#39;s not about controlling their choices. Unschooling is the <br/>\nopposite of neglect, it takes a ton of energy and time to make it <br/>\njoyful and bubbly the way it should be. But as the kids get older, I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s the easier route...because the focus is on happy, strong, <br/>\nrespectful relationships and when you have those, everything else in <br/>\nlife just falls into place.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2983,"nextTopicId":2962}}
