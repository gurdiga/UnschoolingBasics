These boys are <br/>\nbrothers, and sometimes are here at the same time, sometimes separately. <br/>\nThereis a lot of teasing, in schooly way, they are from a very fundamentalist <br/>\nfamily, and I believe they come here because things are just not as tough as at <br/>\nhome. They get &quot;the belt&quot; when punished,  and I even had a lecture from the older <br/>\none once that Tommy should be punished more. I t hink that they are very <br/>\nwrapped ina struggle for power in everything they do as they have less than none at <br/>\nhome. So even play is used to get power. I really love these kids, and I see <br/>\nTommy drawn to the big excitement, fast paced play with them. He gets to do <br/>\nbig guy rough play, and do x-box and watch movies, we float down our river with <br/>\nthem, etc. But I really think that they are attracted to Tommy because they so <br/>\noften get the upper hand by virtue of his age, and because I am so easy going <br/>\ncompared to home. I tend to do stuff with them, playing games, bikes, <br/>\nswimming etc, where their mom is very busy. <br/>\nDs and I have talked about the nature of the friendship, and he knows he is <br/>\nmore relaxed without them , yet he really feels called to their energy, and the <br/>\ngood times they do have. It is almost like they are older brothers to him, so <br/>\nI try to support him thru this, as I won&#39;t make the choice for him. <br/>\nthanks for your reply, Joan. I have calmed down now, and we talked last night <br/>\nabout using physical force, and walking away to get help. I realize he really <br/>\nis very young, just in a big package. He is the same size as the two <br/>\nteenagers. I suggested maybe the kid he had the tussle with was intimidated by his <br/>\nsize, we have experienced that iwth other kids, who go out of their way to pick <br/>\non him because he is soo big.<br/>\nNancy in BC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":31945013,"authorName":"Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese","from":"&quot;Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese&quot; &lt;salgenovese@...&gt;","profile":"jrl01760","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Son is Having Trouble","postDate":"1094132663","msgId":3012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQRUVDRkRBQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGY0LjNmYmEzMWE5LjJlNjdhZjBlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3009,"nextInTopic":3014,"prevInTime":3011,"nextInTime":3013,"topicId":3007,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Nancy, Sorry to hear about your situation which sounds very challenging.

Two main<br/>\nthoughts came to me reading your post.  One was that I was wondering about<br/>\nthe character of your son&#39;s friendships with these boys, especially since<br/>\nyou wrote &quot;I will be glad when all these boys go back to school, and we can<br/>\nbe a bit more peaceful and hang out with some other kids.&quot;  That sounds like<br/>\nperhaps the friendships you are describing in this email are not overall<br/>\npositive ones for your son?  I&#39;m wondering if they are overall positive<br/>\nfriendships which sometimes denigrate into tussles and hard feelings, or if<br/>\nthe tussles and hard feelings and teasing pretty much define the<br/>\nfriendships.  If the former is the case, then it makes sense to me to<br/>\nsupport your son&#39;s hanging out with them and work on the times hard feelings<br/>\nhappen.  If the latter is the case, then it makes more sense to me to talk<br/>\nto your son about the character of the friendships, help him identify<br/>\nwhether they are ones he wants to continue or whether he&#39;d like to break<br/>\nthem off (perhaps with your help) and hang out with the &quot;other kids&quot; to whom<br/>\nyou refer now.  Is there a reason he has to wait till they go back to<br/>\nschool?  That sort of sounds like they are initiating things right now and<br/>\nperhaps your son could use your help thinking things through and breaking<br/>\nthings off with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor friendships that are positive overall and that your son values and wants<br/>\nto keep but where he tends to sometimes lose his temper over things and lash<br/>\nout, in addition to talking about other ways to handle anger, my other<br/>\nthought is that you could try role playing situations your son finds<br/>\ninflamatory with him so that he can practice handling it a different way.<br/>\nThis could be done yourselves or with puppets (I had a friend with a<br/>\ndaughter your son&#39;s age who was amazed at how her daughter responded to<br/>\ndiscussing and working things out through puppet play and swore by it).<br/>\nThis way he&#39;ll have practiced doing things a different way and this may help<br/>\nhim interrupt his own process of coming to physical blows when the next<br/>\nsituation happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood for you for not listening to those telling you it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; and<br/>\nimplying you should ignore it!

They get rough, and there is teasing, and <br/>\nsometimes there is anger about it. Tommy is quick to get hot under his <br/>\ncollar,and still will hit or lash out if he is really ticked off. We dont&#39; spank, did <br/>\n3 times when he was a toddler, then I learned better ways. <br/>\nToday he was at a friend&#39;s house, and a new boy was there he did not know, <br/>\nthey were playing tag, and got into a physical tussle, no adults there to see <br/>\nhow it started. I am mortified and embarassed that he would use physical force, <br/>\nI am told it is normal, I feel very upset that he would do this,and am worried <br/>\nthat he will hurt someone because of his size. How can I help him find <br/>\nalternative ways of solving problems? And working with his temper? <br/>\nI will be glad when all these boys go back to school, and we can be a bit <br/>\nmore peaceful and hang out with some other kids.<br/>\nAny help appreciated<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3070,"nextTopicId":3073}}
