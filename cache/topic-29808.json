That kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A point you seem to be missing, one that Julie may have intended, is<br/>\n&gt; that the basic principles of unschooling apply equally to all of our<br/>\n&gt; children, no matter the circumstances of their early childhood or<br/>\n&gt; their genetic make up or what happened to them in the womb or, as<br/>\n&gt; Julie believes, in a previous life. It isn&#39;t that the challenges our<br/>\n&gt; children face, or that we face in supporting them, are all equally<br/>\n&gt; difficult, but unschooling sits firmly on a basic understanding of how<br/>\n&gt; children learn and if you don&#39;t agree with that, if you are really<br/>\n&gt; convinced that other children learn that way, but not this child, then<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering why you&#39;re here on an unschooling list dedicated to<br/>\n&gt; helping people deepen their understanding and practice of radical<br/>\n&gt; unschooling? You seem to be here more for the purpose of convincing us<br/>\n&gt; that there are kids for whom unschooling just won&#39;t work. If that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; so, I think it isn&#39;t surprising that you feel like the responses are<br/>\n&gt; hostile, because they are predicated on the assumption that people are<br/>\n&gt; here specifically to hear direct and unadulterated unschooling advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**Absolutely not.  I&#39;m not saying unschooling won&#39;t work for every<br/>\nchild at all, although I believe it will look different based on the<br/>\nneeds of the child.  My 11 yr old doesn&#39;t need much in the way of<br/>\nstructure, but my 9 yr old craves structure so I have to do diffrent<br/>\nthings for each of them.  What I have said and people continue to<br/>\neither ignore it or tell me I&#39;m wrong or a horrible parent, is that<br/>\nthere are times when letting a child have complete control is not only<br/>\nirresponsible but negligent.  There are times, and it varies with the<br/>\nage of the child, that as a parent you MUST say &quot;No way...&quot; such as<br/>\nrunning in a busy street.  Now, if you&#39;ve managed to come up with a<br/>\nway to make sure that the kid stays out of the street and you don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to say NO, that&#39;s nifty but you are still saying NO.  Whether you<br/>\nadmit it or not.  Does it matter if they eat nothing but marshmallows<br/>\nfor three days?  No, not usually.  Does it matter if the kid in<br/>\nquestion happens to be diabetic?  You bet your ass it does.  To say it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t and allow any kind of diet because you never want to say NO is<br/>\nto kill your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point with my daughter, is that while your average 3 yr old can be<br/>\nleft in a dirty diaper because they will eventually come to you and<br/>\nask to be cleaned up, because of the abuse and neglect, my daughter<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t read the signals her body is sending her and thus has to be<br/>\ntaught what being clean feels like and that a diaper change doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean a beating.  AND that does NOT make me a horrible parent.  It took<br/>\n4 diaper changes where she would rather we didn&#39;t, was fearful etc. to<br/>\nshow her that there is a different way than what she&#39;s used to.  And<br/>\nif some of you wouldn&#39;t ever do that to your kid that&#39;s fine.  But I<br/>\nknow that adopted kids, neglected adopted kids need to be reparented<br/>\nand get their needs met as an infant is supposed to.  Infants cry when<br/>\ntheir diapers are dirty.  They want to be changed.  Mommy comes and<br/>\nchanges them.  They learn they can count on an adult and they matter.<br/>\nMy daughter may be 3.5 yrs old but not emotionally and not<br/>\ndevelopmentally.  AND she still needs to be reparented.  Because she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t cry about a dirty diaper is DEEPLY sad.  It&#39;s not OK.  It&#39;s<br/>\nnot a sign that something else is more important as others have<br/>\nsuggested.  Yes, that&#39;s true for typical 3.5 yr olds.  I had two of<br/>\nthem.  I remember those days.  This IS different.  She does have to<br/>\nhave a different plan than a kid born into a family that has already<br/>\nlearned trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat a bunch of people have said &quot;pfft that&#39;s not true!&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nit not so.  And if you ask anyone with adoption experience they all<br/>\nknow the reparenting is vital to the bonding and eventual development<br/>\nof the whole person.  So it&#39;s not that it won&#39;t work for her, she is<br/>\nmostly unschooled now anyway because it is the best for our bonding.<br/>\nThere are times it can not be applied because it interferes with the<br/>\nreparenting.  And teaching her that her body is hers and her needs<br/>\nwill be met is important.  In some arenas of life, such as diapering,<br/>\nshe had to be reparented to get the idea that someone cared about her<br/>\nbutt and her comfort.  That when she had a need it would be met, not<br/>\nwith anger and pain but with love and caring.  And if that&#39;s not<br/>\nunschooling I guess I don&#39;t understand the definintion.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: was: Unschooling and Dyslexia now: diapers & medici","postDate":"1203224241","msgId":29872,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzRkEwQTc2LUNFMUUtNDQwRS1CNjEwLUIyRjRCNjRDREE0MkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE2MTYyOXM2ZWJiODExYWg1OGM3ZGYxNTFkYWRjYjQyQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwMjE2MTIxOHI3Y2M0YTA0MW1mM2M2MzE0NzMzYzliOTc0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8ZnA3aW9wK2M1ZWJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw2N2E5ZDc1MDA4MDIxNjE2MjlzNmViYjgxMWFoNThjN2RmMTUxZGFkY2I0MkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29871,"nextInTopic":29880,"prevInTime":29871,"nextInTime":29873,"topicId":29808,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sure, I<br/>\n&gt; could have held him down and forced medicine into him when *I* thought he<br/>\n&gt; needed medicine, but that would have made me look like an ***hole in his<br/>\n&gt; eyes and heart.

I used to wonder the same thing,<br/>\n&quot;hmmm, maybe if I just leave him in it long enough he&#39;ll get so disgusted<br/>\nwith it, he&#39;ll beg to be changed.  Nope.  And really, that just felt, to me,<br/>\nlike a mean thing to do.  Sage really didn&#39;t object, after all, to having<br/>\nhis diaper changed, he objected to leaving said activity to have his diaper<br/>\nchanged.  If I&#39;m trying to get him to come into the bathroom with me so I<br/>\ncan wipe him where *I think it&#39;s convenient, forget it.  So, I finally<br/>\nlearned (yes!  still learning!) to do it completely on his terms.  I soak<br/>\nthe cloths with warm water, and go to where he is.  While he plays or<br/>\nwatches tv, or whatever it is he&#39;s doing, I pull off the diaper, wipe him up<br/>\nand he&#39;s done.  No coercion at all, he&#39;s happy to stand there, uninterrupted<br/>\nin what he was doing, while I take care of the rest.  Win/Win!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t want to be treated for a<br/>\n&gt; nasty inner ear infection...should I say &quot;Oh hell, whatever...if she<br/>\n&gt; wants the meds she&#39;ll ask?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**And I even have a reply for this! :)  Right now we&#39;ve been kissed with the<br/>\ngift of chicken pox in our house.  My 6yo (middle son) wants nothing to do<br/>\nwith ANY remedy or comforting solution I offer him.  But, I just keep<br/>\noffering.
