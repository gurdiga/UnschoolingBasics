I called her because I knew I could count on her too give me that kick on the but I needed. I don&#39;t need no one to give me a pat on the shoulder when I KNOW I  need  to change. <br/>\nEven when doing that she was so sweet and supportive and soft spoken. It makes a huge difference when you can actually hear the person&#39;s voice. <br/>\n  Kelly is an awesome person and mother. A great friend and someone I look up to.<br/>\n  Maybe someday I will be like her....<br/>\n  Love,<br/>\n  Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n          Original message:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people, when they are sharing their wisdom with other parents,<br/>\nwould be as kind and respectful as they are suggesting being with the<br/>\nchildren, maybe Karen would not be feeling so abused.
