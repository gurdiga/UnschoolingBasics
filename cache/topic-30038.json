There&#39;s actually much more evidence throughout history that supports unschooling!  Take a look sometime at the list of people that have not attended school that have changed the world as we know it.  It helped me to learn that school was set up for a much different reason than it&#39;s used today, and it hasn&#39;t been around all that long.  Long enough to do lots of damage to lots of kids, but not long from a historical perspective anyway.  I know that isn&#39;t your particular question, just my two cents :o).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\njesika2starr &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jesika2starr@...\">jesika2starr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          How long has unschooling, as we know it, been around?

So your mom&#39;s grandparents and all their friends <br/>\nwere more than likely unschooled. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt started promoting &quot;no school&quot; about 1975-76. Before that he <br/>\nwas a school reformer. So the *young* children of the parents he was <br/>\nreaching &quot;became adults&quot; in the late 1990s. The second &quot;wave&quot; is just <br/>\nreaching adulthood now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 20 and, although not fully on board with unschooling when we <br/>\nstarted, is a HUGE advocate now. He knows he can do anything. <br/>\nPlus---he&#39;s seen his schooled friends struggling so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;d be happy to answer any specific questions you may have: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:phishm@...\">phishm@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think there&#39;s a TXUnschoolers group at yahoo---look around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
