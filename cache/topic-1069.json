It may be<br/>\ndifferent in you case, but in mine I think Priscilla&#39;s dad has just<br/>\nconvinced her that she can&#39;t live without the friends she&#39;s made and the<br/>\nteachers she&#39;s met.  The funny thing I realized though is that she was<br/>\n&quot;absent&quot; more this past year than any year in her life.  If she stays home<br/>\nfor a mental health day, as we like to call it, we just go all over the<br/>\nplace doing things or we sit home and play on the computer.  I think she has<br/>\nreally come to love these days.<br/>\n     I have hope that some day she will tall her father the way it is and<br/>\njust leave school.  She is more than aware of the legal age to drop out of<br/>\nschool, which she found on her own by the way, in Vermont and I think she<br/>\nplans to take advantage of that.<br/>\n    We&#39;ll see....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bethryco@...\">Bethryco@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Bethryco@...\">Bethryco@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 25, 2004 10:58 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] forced public school<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  AnnMarie,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m a stepmom to a PSer.
