In this state it is pretty much about her ACT score.  We bought a computer disc and she took an intial practice test so we could just see where we were with it.  Her score is already high enough to get into college.  She wants to do some of the lessons on the disc to get it up a bit more and we need to go over some math symbols.  Her composite score was really good, but her math on its on was kindof low.  ONce we do that and I show her a few calculator trick she&#39;ll be fine.  She has been unschooled since about 6th grade, we were relaxed home schoolers since 4th grade.<br/>\n  We went to a lot of trouble to prepare a port folio with my older daughter, they didn&#39;t give it a glance, just looked at the test score and admitted her.  I&#39;m sure it varies with different schools in different states.  Basically my kids just &#39;learn that test&#39;, take it and go on with their plans.  <br/>\n  18 year old is going so she can get involved with the theater department.  I think she will have a great time with it.  Even if she doesn&#39;t bring up the partcular math score, they will still admit her, she will just take an easier math class and work her way up until she fullfills their requirement.  She is thinking she may do that anyway, just so it&#39;s easier.<br/>\n  Ann  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n        Secondary school education   Graduate school education   Home school education     Graduate school education online   High school education   Chicago school education <br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

We would meet with the Dean of the college he was applying to. We would request an interview---or three. We would have reference letters from other artists he&#39;s worked with---either musically or magically or visually (and some of those are some mighty BIG names in their fields (Skip Pearson, Jeff McBride, Alan Nu, Christian Thee). We would have letters from band members, employers, and professors whose classes he&#39;s sat in on. He&#39;s travelled extensively: we&#39;d include all that. We&#39;d list his volunteer work in the community. Ben would help him with more of a resume-style application, showing what&#39;s he&#39;s accomplished.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe would NOT submit a diploma or grades or GPA. He *might* be talked into taking the SAT. but I bet he would talk them OUT of it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re looking at 500 regular schooled applications and ONE unusual one, which one sticks out???<br/>\n <br/>\nWe *could* chose to have his application look like every other one, but that wouldn&#39;t get him noticed. BE different! Unlike highschools, colleges LOVE diversity! Make him stand out!<br/>\n<br/>\nColleges are recruiting unschoolers now. Unschoolers are overwhelmingly admired by professors who are damned tired of looking at bored, disinterested faces of kids who are in college because that&#39;s the next step or because that&#39;s just what&#39;s expected of them or because they have nothing else to do and have no direction in their lives. UNSCHOOLERS, on the other hand are there by choice---because there&#39;s something to pursue. They&#39;re bright and energetic students whose love of learning has not been lost. In fact, they&#39;ve become so wrapped up in what their passions are, they&#39;ve chosen college to further that knowledge. That makes them great students, whom professors LOVE!<br/>\n <br/>\nI would just let your 13 year old pursue passions to the nth degree. His portfolio will speak for itself!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9150,"nextTopicId":9207}}
