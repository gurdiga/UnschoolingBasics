Brooke pointed out this one that was so bright<br/>\nthat it looked like an airplane light.  I then said, &quot;You can name it<br/>\nairplane if you want to.&quot;  She was so thrilled and named it<br/>\n&#39;airplane&#39;, then I asked if she&#39;d like to maybe name some stars after<br/>\nour family and of course she said yes.  We each have our stars<br/>\nincluding two close together named &#39;twins&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile doing that I couldn&#39;t help but feel a little envious of the<br/>\nancients before us, why should we have to name them and know them by<br/>\nwhat they called them?  Why are their discoveries more important than<br/>\nours?  I don&#39;t say that to belittle or be unappreciative towards our<br/>\nancestors but a little joy is stolen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, for right now in my 8yo&#39;s eyes, when we look at them as we<br/>\nhave since naming them...they are our set of stars, discovered and<br/>\nnamed by my daughter.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy Winn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12091,"nextTopicId":12090}}
