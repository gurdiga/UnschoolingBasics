Again, <br/>\nover to Sandra&#39;s site to read about playing.  :)  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/playing\">http://sandradodd.com/playing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-=-He has never been consumed with anything or one interest.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made my smile because I can&#39;t COUNT how many times I&#39;ve read <br/>\nparents lamenting the *opposite* of this.
