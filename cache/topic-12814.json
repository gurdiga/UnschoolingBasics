Well I guess one thing about Oklahoma is you pretty much make your <br/>\nown rules(sad thing is that home schooling is the only thing they trust <br/>\nus parents on lol)<br/>\nBut I figured I would share to let you know tests are not always right. <br/>\nTo hear my oldest read is amazing. He is 6 years old and reads with <br/>\namazing speed and comprehends well past 4th grade(as far a PS goes) He <br/>\nalso at home does stuff with Science harder math and all kinds  of <br/>\ngrammer stuff. BUT when he was tested at the school he shows as a <br/>\ntransitional reader....just comprehending how sounds go together. THey <br/>\ndont even test for knowledge of much else. Mainly because he knows your <br/>\ngrading him and he gets stressed and just wants to get it done and over <br/>\nso he can play. Now if I stand there and he knows that I want him to <br/>\ntake his time look at it and then answer and after everything no matter <br/>\nwhat we will still go play he will do fine.(sorry about the run on <br/>\nsentence lol) HE HATED being tested in the school. He said he already <br/>\nknew it and thats all that mattered lol (from the mouth of a 6 year <br/>\nold) Dont panic on the testing. Most kids just don&#39;t like taking them <br/>\nand will forget everything and just answer without looking to get it <br/>\ndone.

I<br/>\nwould also see if your state has an umbrella school option that would<br/>\neliminate the need for either testing or evaluations.

Standardized tests","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-394275991\">Amen Sister! The scope of learning for unschooling children is broad compaired to what is drilled into children&#39;s heads at public schools. <br/>\n<br/>\nStandardized tests are designed to measure comprehension of a what is taught in school. Just because your child may not know those things doesn&#39;t mean she knows less than any school child or that she is less intelligent. We don&#39;t do &quot;tests&quot; or &quot;grades&quot; at my house so my children would definately be out of their element in this situation. It could be that your child was nervous because she hasn&#39;t been that kind of environment much or it could be that she has simply learned different things than what is taught in school. We don&#39;t put limits on what our children learn, the pace at which they learn, or how much time is spent on each subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see,  I&#39;m not a big fan of standardized tests. My daughters went to school and took the kindergarten and second grade tests and did quite well, but they were no  where near &quot;on grade level&quot; according to what I saw them doing every day. They both have significant vision problems that were not diagnosed until a year or so after the tests so I know they couldn&#39;t even see most of what was going on in the classroom, yet they passed those tests. I find this very curious. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived in Texas then and now live in Oregon were there are testing requirements for homeschoolers. Children are supossed to be tested in 3rd, 5th, 8th and 10th grades. However, the testing is the resposibility of the parents and the parents just have to keep the test scores on file incase they are requested by the ESD. I don&#39;t know anyone who has ever been asked to produce test scores. Children only have to  score  at the 15th  percentile or better. If they score lower they just have to take the test again next year and show some improvement to continue hsing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ten year old will have to take the test next year and I am concerned about it. She doesn&#39;t read well, but is making progress on her own and is not stressed about it and does not feel judged or bad about herself because of it. I don&#39;t want to push her to try to make her live up to someone else expectations. I know that if I let her develop naturally she will get it when she is ready. I&#39;ve seen this happen with my twelve year old. Two years ago she didn&#39;t read or spell well know she is ready chapter books on her own and following recipes to cook, etc.  I so love the natural learning process  and it feels so right for us. wouldn&#39;t it be great if the rest of the world leave us be? <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a> wrote:    Hi Angela.
