Since I ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2080535621\">Lesa,<br/>\n<br/>\nI became a pagan 5 years ago--previously I was a Catholic.  We were never<br/>\nvery religious but the kids know the basic Bible stories and such.  Since I<br/>\nchanged my beliefs, the older kids at first said that they are still<br/>\nCatholic, and that was fine with me.  Then they said they just believe in<br/>\nGod, and that was also fine with me. Now they are all saying they are<br/>\natheists---which I think is pretty normal for many 16-18 year olds at some<br/>\npoint.  My younger children ask me questions about God and Jesus (especially<br/>\nafter watching Jesus Christ Superstar) and I answer them truthfully with the<br/>\nknowledge that I have learned.  I tell them that many people believe in God<br/>\nand believe that Jesus is the son of God--I just don&#39;t follow that faith.  I<br/>\nwill answer any questions they have about ANY faith, if I don&#39;t know it then<br/>\nI will find out for them or help them to find out the answers themselves. We<br/>\nhave Bibles in the house and other Christian books and they are free to read<br/>\nthem and learn.  All I have said to them is find whatever is right for them,<br/>\nthey don&#39;t have to study Druidism because I do---or Catholicism because<br/>\nthat&#39;s what I used to be--they don&#39;t have to be any religion.  I did ask<br/>\nthat someday when they are interested in a higher power, find out about<br/>\ndifferent ones and choose what is right for them.  Of course, my ex inlaws<br/>\ntotally contradict this because in their eyes there are no other Gods or<br/>\nreligions other than the Catholic Church but I just tell the kids that is<br/>\ntheir belief and it is ok for them to have that belief--the kids are free to<br/>\nbelieve in whatever they choose.  As far as your son goes, he is only 2 and<br/>\nis happy to have books to look at and be read to---don&#39;t worry about the<br/>\ncontent, just read the story.  Most &quot;religious&quot; childrens stories are told<br/>\nto teach a moral lesson anyway and basically hold the same moralities that<br/>\nanyone from any religion can agree with.  I think that even if you disagree<br/>\nwith the religious aspect, it is still a part of your mother and if you are<br/>\ninvolved in a relationship with her, he is going to know that she is<br/>\nreligious and believes a certain way no matter what you keep from him.<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong (IMHO)with children learning about different<br/>\nreligions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nLeslie:-) <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Lesa ODaniel<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 28, 2006 3:56 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Mother...Religion...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do?

I plan to treat the topic the same as any other.  I <br/>\nrecall being very interested in religion as a child (and mysticism), <br/>\nfrom a very early age of 5 or 6 so I want to be ready (and open) for <br/>\nmy daughter if she takes the same interest.  I just want to have <br/>\nbooks about all kinds of religions & philosophy around my house - <br/>\nboth children&#39;s books & adult books (I liked adult books as a sm <br/>\nchild), so she will have the option to read them when she wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, a couple mos before my daughter&#39;s 3rd bday, I picked up <br/>\ntwo books by the same author, &quot;What is Religion&quot; & &quot;What is Death&quot;, <br/>\nboth of which she occasionally likes to have read to her.  They are <br/>\nnot story books, just facts, and a bit wordy for a 2-3 yr old, but <br/>\nshe has asked to read them 4 or 5 times since we first boughht them <br/>\nso I know she doesn&#39;t hate them, lol.  They address the perspectives <br/>\nof about 5 commonly known religions and athiesm.  I also have books <br/>\nabout Jesus & some holiday books on Hannakuh(sp?), and plan to <br/>\ngather more story type books on other religions or philosophy&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I may need to introduce myself. I&#39;ve been on various boards <br/>\na long time, but haven&#39;t been active the last year or so due to <br/>\npersonal issues.  Since the new digests are so kick ass, I&#39;ve <br/>\ndecided to dig back into reading at least one new group, and this <br/>\nseemed a great starting point.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 3 1/2, we plan to unschool.  I hang out at parkdays <br/>\nwith other unschoolers, chat/stay active on at least one other <br/>\nunschool board, and try to read up anywhere I can in my free time.  <br/>\nWhile deep down I feel confident that unschooling is right & best, I <br/>\nseem to have great resistance, externally, in many of my actions. I <br/>\nhave faith it will all sink in with time, practice, and work. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl <br/>\n(mamma to Natalie, 10/02)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been interested in religions, sprituality, and since I <br/>\nstarted out as a christian, I embrace it&#39;s part in my journey.  With <br/>\nthat in mind, I have been purchasing books that cover several <br/>\nreligions, or spirituality, in general.  My daughter is 3 1/2. Last <br/>\nyear, a couple mos before her 3rd bday, I ordered 2 books by the <br/>\nsame authors, &quot;what is God&quot; & &quot;What is Death&quot;.  I thought they <br/>\nsounded too advanced but wanted them around just in case, or for <br/>\nfuture use. Our order was split up, and when the God book arrived   <br/>\nI looked it over & it definitely seemed too advanced for her.  <br/>\nHwoever, she saw it in the box & knew it was a &quot;present&quot;, lol, and <br/>\nwanted to read it.  So we gave it a test drive.  I was surprised she <br/>\nliked it, the topic seemed a bit too *boring*, and there was not a <br/>\nstory line, and it was a wordier book than the others we were <br/>\nreading.  But it stuck, to a small degree.  She asked to read it two <br/>\nor three more times in the next couple weeks.  Then it got lost in <br/>\nthe sea of books, as often happens with her books if they&#39;re not a <br/>\nbig favorite.  Since then, she has still come across it & asked to <br/>\nread it, and she remembers the books names (bible, torah, etc), and <br/>\nBudah, mohammed, Jesus, it&#39;s funny to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lesa ODaniel&quot; <br/>\n&lt;lesaodaniel@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What to do?

We made things available and let the kids choose what to explore. So I had the books on Judaism my mil sent along with my childhood Bible along with The Tao of Pooh and a book of world religions. We talked about it all. We sometimes were able to see different places of worship or participate in other people&#39;s ceremonies with them. From my own belief system, I never presented any one way as the &quot;only&quot; way.

If he chooses to read through them, it should  <br/>\nbe easy to just bite your tongue and do it. If he doesn&#39;t like them,  <br/>\nthen you aren&#39;t the one choosing, he is. And if he has some he really  <br/>\nlikes, then you can take pleasure in his pleasure. Veggietale books  <br/>\naren&#39;t always blatantly religious, we have some good math and telling  <br/>\ntime ones that the kids like. And even the really religious ones,  <br/>\nlike &quot;Where&#39;s God when I&#39;m scared?&quot; address issues that many children  <br/>\nface, and help. Even if YOU don&#39;t face it from a Christian aspect, it  <br/>\ncan open the door to discussions with him about why or why not some  <br/>\npeople are scared of the dark, other fears that sometimes pop up,  <br/>\nway&#39;s we can help those we love, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that this reminds me of, in my autism group there is a set  <br/>\nof parents who are athiests, very strongly so. Their son with  <br/>\naspergers really needed a religious experience, he desired  <br/>\nexplanations for the beginning of all, and the science wasn&#39;t enough.  <br/>\nSo they did have to break out of their comfort level, experiment with  <br/>\nseveral churches, and they found one that they were not too offended  <br/>\nby. They enjoyed the community aspect, and he was able to learn and  <br/>\nexperience more. I don&#39;t know how you can &#39;get past it&#39; but I think  <br/>\nit&#39;s important to let your children be exposed to alternatives safely  <br/>\nand knowing that you will support them regardless.

I think it is important that you talk to<br/>\nyour mother and tell her in respectful language that you know that she<br/>\nloves you and cares for you and your son.  You appreciate her<br/>\nthoughtfulness in sending him books and other presents (I&#39;m sure).<br/>\nThen say, &quot;I feel disrespected when religious material is sent to our<br/>\nhome when  you know that we don&#39;t agree on the matter of religion.&quot;<br/>\nThis is YOUR home.  Yes; we are unschoolers, but even on the subject<br/>\nof religion we are allowed opinions and the ability to express those<br/>\nopinions to your child when you feel your child is old enough to be<br/>\nable to look at things objectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had this same discussion with my own mother.  My mom is an<br/>\nEpiscopal priest.  Over the years she has greatly mellowed, but when<br/>\nshe first started sending religious things to my home I had to put a<br/>\nstop to it.  She was spending her money for things that my children<br/>\nwould never get.  I also felt that while I respected her religion in<br/>\nher home (bowing my head for prayers and not talking about my<br/>\nreligious beliefs in her home) I expected the same respect from her in<br/>\nmy home.  I would never gift my mom with a pentacle no matter how<br/>\nbeautiful I thought it was.  I would never give my mom a book written<br/>\nby some eclectic Pagan author because I know that to her it was deemed<br/>\nevil.  Fortunately, my mom has come a long way and now is much more<br/>\nunitarian in her beliefs.  It took us a LONG time to get to that<br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all comes down to respect and you need to establish that respect<br/>\nnow while your son is young so that it doesn&#39;t become a battling<br/>\nground when he is older.<br/>\n<br/>\nJMNSHO<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205756159,"authorName":"Lesa ODaniel","from":"&quot;Lesa ODaniel&quot; &lt;lesaodaniel@...&gt;","profile":"lesao2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Mother...Religion...","postDate":"1151524576","msgId":15038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwMi1GMTIzMDBDNzIyNUVDMzcwNUI5OEMxQUIwN0YwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15041,"prevInTime":15037,"nextInTime":15039,"topicId":15038,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What to do?
