I used to do this when I felt pressured to make sure my kids where learning what others thought they &quot;should&quot; be learning.

Does<br/>\nit mean &quot;keep a portfolio that equates to 4 hours of school work each day&quot;<br/>\nor does it mean &quot;write in a notebook that on Tuesday you did &#39;schoolwork&#39;<br/>\nfrom 11am to 3pm?&quot;  If it is the former, then make a scrapbook of all your<br/>\n&quot;stuff.&quot;  Everything we do is a learning experience.  Cooking, watching a tv<br/>\nshow (want to see how I document That&#39;s  So Raven as an educational<br/>\nmoment?), reading the paper (who cares if it is just the sports or comics),<br/>\nand playing outside, planting seeds, drawing in a notebook, etc etc etc.<br/>\nWhen our minds are active we are learning!  If documentation is the latter<br/>\ndescription then just write down a block of time each day that your child is<br/>\nawake!  I wonder when the school districts are going to realize that home<br/>\neducated children don&#39;t need to jump through all these hoops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought is to check around and see if you have any cover or umbrella<br/>\nschools that are unschooling friendly that report to the state or school<br/>\ndistrict for you.  I chose that route in Florida so I didn&#39;t have to deal<br/>\nwith having annual reviews.  I just don&#39;t believe that it is the<br/>\ngovernment&#39;s business how I educate my children.
