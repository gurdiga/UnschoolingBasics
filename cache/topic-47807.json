At that time we lived in Wyoming where I only knew one other unschooling family who had 2 boys, older than our girls (who are now 6 and 9.5).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been attending the Life is Good conference for the past 5 years, during which time we moved to Portland, OR.  In the past we&#39;ve hosted funshops and circle chats and been on panels, but his year I&#39;m going to be a speaker.  I&#39;m very excited, and have some things I want to talk about, but I wanted to pick the brains of the folks here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any topics/specific questions/things you wish you knew at the very beginning of your unschooling journey?  Things that could have helped you jump into unschooling?  Questions you still have?  A &quot;best piece&quot; of advice someone gave you?  (Or on the other hand, something someone suggested that you try that bombed big time?  :)  )<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to reply here, or email me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!
