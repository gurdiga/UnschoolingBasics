I also saw this great quote in one of the sections above <br/>\nthe reviews and wanted to share it (the comment after it is part of <br/>\nthe quote from amazon):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;Think of life as a game in which we juggle five balls labeled Work, <br/>\nFamily, Health, Friends and Integrity. One day, you understand Work <br/>\nis a rubber ball. You drop it and it bounces back. The other four <br/>\nballs are made of glass. Drop one of those, and it will be <br/>\nirrevocably marked, scuffed, nicked and maybe even shattered.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What a sweet quote. I found it in a New York Times review of Nina <br/>\nDiSesa&#39;s book, Seducing the Boys Club: Uncensored Tactics From a <br/>\nWoman at the Top. It&#39;s advice given to Ms. DiSesa by James Patterson, <br/>\nthe best-selling author and former chairman of the J. W. Thompson <br/>\nadvertising firm.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing the book recommendation, I&#39;m glad to have seen it <br/>\nand that quote.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332347767,"authorName":"lspswr","from":"&quot;lspswr&quot; &lt;lspswr@...&gt;","profile":"lspswr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Respectful communication tools","postDate":"1203637297","msgId":30155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwbDI3aCtzZHE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30181,"prevInTime":30154,"nextInTime":30156,"topicId":30155,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would like to share a resource that relates to the recent discussions on dealing with various communication challenges.

In the past year I have used this book just as much, if <br/>\nnot more, than any parenting or partnering/relationship book.
