It is<br/>\na natural extension of attachment parenting, certainly.  But my husband<br/>\nChris and I were also very affected by our schooling-I went to one of<br/>\nthe &quot;best&quot; high schools in the country, through the accelerated<br/>\nprograms, then did my obligatory 4 years in college and got a Master&#39;s<br/>\ndegree, blah blah blah, only to find out that none of that meant<br/>\nanything to me after I had kids.  Chris went through a terrible school<br/>\nsystem, had a horrible time with college and dropped out, and now swears<br/>\nthat he will never return.  For both of us the social environment of<br/>\nschool was a nightmare.  So our schooling background has definitely<br/>\ninfluenced our decision, at least to homeschool.

We also want<br/>\nto live the unjobbing lifestyle as soon as possible (ironically, here&#39;s<br/>\nwhere my MS will be useful, as I can teach part time at the community<br/>\ncollege-a perfect unjobbing opportunity but about as un-unschooling as<br/>\nyou can get).<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to the old &quot;farts&quot; who started this list.

Came<br/>\nacross John Holt&#39;s books while pregnant with first and began to<br/>\nrealize that there might be another, BETTER, way to experience a<br/>\nchildhood, and I wanted that for my child.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Are you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do<br/>\nyou  <br/>\n&gt; find it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to<br/>\neducational things?  <br/>\n&gt; Or do you want it as a lifestyle?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely a whole-life philosophy for us! The education part is<br/>\nEASY, though; we still struggle quite a bit with the nitty gritty of<br/>\nrespecting each other in the day-to-day of a fairly large and diverse<br/>\nfamily!<br/>\n  <br/>\n&gt; I also want to invite everyone to SERIOUSLY consider the Live and<br/>\nLearn  <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling Conference which is being held in Peabody, MA (snip) It&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; inspirational! You&#39;ll go home full of ideas and confidence that what<br/>\nyou&#39;re  doing is <br/>\n&gt; RIGHT and GOOD. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMe and many of mine will be there.  And I&#39;m doing my best to drag<br/>\nalong some others from my area.  I went to SC last year (met few of<br/>\nyou - I&#39;m pretty shy in crowds) and came back so totally pumped that<br/>\npeople couldn&#39;t shut me up about it for weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I can be helpful here.  I&#39;ll try to at least share stories from<br/>\ntime to time, trusting that what works for me might  work for others<br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hello to you Rhode Islanders lurking out there!

As did my dh. The difference for<br/>\nus was parental support. I learned that my parents did not ever believe I<br/>\nwas right or deserved to be stood up for. I can remember calling home (from<br/>\nhigh school) in tears because some girl (real tough bully) had been told<br/>\nthat I said she was a slut (didn&#39;t) and she was completely dedicated to<br/>\nbeating me to a pulp. I have never had a physical fight and was terrified of<br/>\nthis girl. All through lunch she followed me everywhere with her gang of<br/>\ngirls. I tried to stay in busy places like the lunch room and library and<br/>\ngymnasium, but in each place she managed to intimidate me and scare me and<br/>\npush things a bit further. When she pushed me down a flight of stairs I<br/>\ndecided to call my mom (I was already so indoctrinated to believe I had no<br/>\nvalue I couldn&#39;t even make the decision for myself that I would leave school<br/>\nfor that day) and asked her to come get me. And her reply? What did I do to<br/>\ndeserve this? And I should better stay and deal with this because if I ran<br/>\ncrying home every time someone was mean to me I wouldn&#39;t learn how to stand<br/>\nup for myself. Nice lesson. Just an example that not only did I learn that<br/>\nschool was a torture chamber each day but there was no one to defend me. Now<br/>\nmy dh also had hell in school but his parents supported him in every battle<br/>\nand stood up for him and his mom actually fought the school board when he<br/>\nwas kicked out in grade 12 for handing out literature on birth control to<br/>\nthe girls in the late 60&#39;s. Different lesson that ended in us both hating<br/>\npublic school and being totally committed to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo after my dd was born (now 4) I was sure I would do it, but scared, how<br/>\nwould I do the lesson plans, how would I know what to teach? How could I<br/>\nteach what I didn&#39;t know? Etc etc . and I just was overwhelmed again and<br/>\nthen started to read about unschooling. We are totally committed to it as a<br/>\nmeans of &quot;education&quot;. I am not too sure about embracing it as a total life<br/>\nstyle yet and my dh feels the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have relaxed on the TV, food and bedtimes a bit mostly listening to her<br/>\nwishes more and not imposing ours as much. But I am not ready to totally let<br/>\ngo. I guess some will see that as a lack of trust in her, I don&#39;t see it<br/>\nthat way. I also see that when she feels she has too many choices she is<br/>\noverwhelmed and doesn&#39;t know what to do. As some other posters have said I<br/>\nbelieve it is my job to teach some limits and to help her to learn her way,<br/>\nhow that will look who knows? Now with #2 on the way things might change a<br/>\nlot.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did follow an AP style for parenting. It was hard for my dh as he felt at<br/>\ntimes that she was &quot;out of control&quot; but now he is seeing the rewards of it<br/>\nin this special amazing young girl who is so creative and imaginative and<br/>\ntalented that he is reassured to endure some of the challenges with #2<br/>\n(whew!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to go to the conference but as a Canadian, I am not sure how<br/>\napplicable it would be to us. Also the distance is imposing. Perhaps next<br/>\nyear. My dh is familiar with Holt&#39;s work, read him in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s<br/>\nactually and has some of his early books and feels that his approach and<br/>\nattitude is too American and not applicable to us as Canadians.  Now I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t read any of his yet, but I am going to get dh to dig up his books<br/>\n(yes he still has them. doesn&#39;t throw anything out makes for some<br/>\ninteresting memorabilia) and start on them. Any suggestions on where to<br/>\nstart, what book specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you feel about Gordon Neufeld if you are familiar with him at all?<br/>\nHe seems to have extensive info on homeschooling (not sure on his attitude<br/>\nabout unschooling) and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI took a wonderful course on bonding last week as one of the modules for my<br/>\nNLP certificate and was just amazed at the wealth of info on bonding and how<br/>\nit will affect learning etc and how to correct a glitch in the bond. Very<br/>\nfascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for asking these questions, it is great to hear what others are<br/>\nsaying, I think I went off a bit but it is where it led me..

I saw someone, I think maybe Pam, had this list in her signature line, I think.  I checked it out, and feel much more comfortable posting on this list.  As a newbie it is easier to post with a group newbies.  I came to unschooling from a friend I met in a local homeschool group.  She is a radical unschooler, and was a moderator on Sandra&#39;s list.  When I first heard about unschooling, I said &quot;there is no way that can work for us.&quot;  We were doing school at home, restrictions, time outs, the whole thing.  We completely let go of the school at home, and have been slowly working into all other aspects of this life.  Food restrictions are gone, TV restrictions are gone, and we are working on bedtime.  We let go of everything at once, and it was too much for our 6yo ds to handle.  Life for him was chaos.  So we went back to a semi scheduled life, and have let go a little at a time.  Much easier for him to work into.  He is a very happy child,<br/>\n and comes up with things that just blow me away.  Yesterday he explained to me how shadows are created.  I asked him where he had learned it.  Baby Loony Toons!!  Who knew!!  That evil TV is really worth something!!  LOL!  <br/>\n <br/>\nOur life has changed so much, as we came to this from a place that was nowhere near here.  No AP, no gentle parenting, and were planning on sending our son to school. We had decided to school at home and had been doing it for a year when we came to unschooling.  It is amazing how one chance meeting with one person can change the whole direction of your life.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did y&#39;all find UnschoolingBasics?

Or do you<br/>\nfind it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational<br/>\nthings?<br/>\nOr do you want it as a lifestyle?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been on this list a month, so I think I qualify as a newbie.  I&#39;m<br/>\ncoming to unschooling from attachment parenting - it seems a natural<br/>\nextension of it in many ways.  I&#39;ve considered homeschooling from the get<br/>\ngo, and read Mary Griffith&#39;s Homeschooling Handbook, which interested me in<br/>\nthis unschooling approach.  So I read her Unschooling book and realized this<br/>\nwas for us.  It fits my daughter&#39;s personality perfectly, and my own as<br/>\nwell, and after I read it I thought, Wow, I guess if I am going to buy a<br/>\ncurriculum I might as well send them to school.  My gift to them can be to<br/>\nlet them lead themselves and me and keep that amazing spark of learning and<br/>\ndesire alive and every day they can live the wonderful message that what<br/>\nthey are interested in is the most important thing at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;ve come to question what I tend to think of as &quot;educational&quot;<br/>\nthings.  I think that&#39;s deschooling for me!  So I&#39;ve come to think that when<br/>\nwe are working on peaceful conflict resolution, we are learning something<br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; together - we are learning about valuable life skills - how to<br/>\nresolve conflicts.  Since I&#39;ve got on this list we&#39;ve started learning from<br/>\nthe milk we spilled or the egg we dropped - I can start to see what<br/>\nunschoolers mean when they say that it&#39;s all just living.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy two cents for what it&#39;s worth, which may be what everyone paid for it,<br/>\nabout the hard feelings that happen on email lists with folks not feeling<br/>\nrespected, is - and I&#39;ll speak for what I&#39;ve noticed about myself - when I<br/>\ndon&#39;t feel the needs I&#39;ve expressed for myself in a post have been heard and<br/>\nunderstood and reflected back in the answer, then I tend to get angry and<br/>\ndefensive and feel disrespected.  That doesn&#39;t mean the sender implied or<br/>\nintended any disrespect, it is just the impact on me.  So personally when<br/>\nreplying to someone I try to say what I&#39;d like someone else to say if I were<br/>\nin their shoes.  Not just so I don&#39;t cause hard feelings, but also because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to waste my time on an email that is not really heard and I want<br/>\nto do what I can so the other person can hear my intended message.  I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen on many email lists, including ones with groups where I know and see<br/>\nall the people personally, and email just seems to promote difficult<br/>\ncommunication issues.  As wonderful as email is to hook us all up, it&#39;s a<br/>\nhard medium for emotional issues, and certainly our issues with parenting<br/>\nand unschooling our kids are emotional ones.  I very much enjoy this list<br/>\nand appreciate the time and effort the folks setting it up have put in.<br/>\nthanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\nMom to Aline 5.7 & Nicky 3.4</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: newbies and how did you find us?","postDate":"1088276824","msgId":1102,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNia2hnbytyZWdiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJkLjNmNjQ4ZGNlLjJlMGYxMzNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1100,"nextInTopic":1103,"prevInTime":1101,"nextInTime":1103,"topicId":1100,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Woohoo!!

Attachment parenting was so different than <br/>\nwhat I knew. Didn&#39;t always feel right, but I kept doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mikey was two, we started expecting him to follow rules because <br/>\n1) we didn&#39;t like kids of permissive parents and 2) he could <br/>\nunderstand rules and why we had them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a bad year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got on a couple homeschooling pre-k lists. Even before I read Alfie <br/>\nKohn, I was not comfortable by how people had all sorts of reward <br/>\nsystems set up to get their kids to learn. Then I moved to more <br/>\ngentle homeschooling lists. Other people&#39;s kids seemed to be thriving <br/>\ndoing projects from start to finish and sitting down to be taught. <br/>\nDidn&#39;t work with us. Made us all uptight and unhappy. So to be <br/>\nperfectly honest, I got to unschooling because nothing else worked! I <br/>\ndid not think it would work either at first, but the more I thought <br/>\nabout my experiences in school, the more sense it made to do the <br/>\ncomplete opposite. Mikey is a lot like me, so it might actually work <br/>\nfor him, I sez to myself. I&#39;ve been reading a ton about unschooling <br/>\nover the last few months, after starting to read about not using <br/>\nconsequences and other similar parenting philosophies.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, I&#39;m relaxing controls on food and sleep and helping with <br/>\nclean up. The food issue is going well. I was prepared for Mikey to <br/>\neat lots of junk and he actually is eating more variety and more <br/>\nfruit and other good stuff than I thought. (I know, think of it not <br/>\nas junk and good...I&#39;ll get there!) <br/>\n<br/>\nOther stuff is harder, like the attitude about helping or even just <br/>\nnot making a mess while I&#39;m cleaning up. Okay if he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\ncome to the dining room while we eat, but I don&#39;t like him screaming <br/>\nfor me in the living room while I&#39;m eating! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re starting to get into a groove, now that dh isn&#39;t traveling, <br/>\nwe&#39;re not traveling, and I&#39;m spending less time on the computer <br/>\nreading everything I can find about unschooling! I think he needs <br/>\ntons of attention and love right now--I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a physical <br/>\nor emotional growth spurt or just a reaction to how things have been, <br/>\nbut man! Any little thing makes him scream...and then it&#39;s really <br/>\nhard to help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: where are the support groups for NCP? Is there a support <br/>\ngroup for unschooling? It seems like there&#39;s a need for flat out <br/>\nsupport that&#39;s not being met on the unschooling discussion lists. Is <br/>\nthere a web site about the conference? I don&#39;t think we can make, but <br/>\nI&#39;d like to tell dh about it and offer to send him, LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to go refill the bowl of red white and blue goldfish for the boy <br/>\nand snuggle up on the couch to watch tv with him!<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj, mama to Mikey, 3.5 and Caroline, who will be 1.5 tomorrow!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"newbies and how did you find us?","postDate":"1088272703","msgId":1100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJkLjNmNjQ4ZGNlLjJlMGYxMzNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":1102,"prevInTime":1099,"nextInTime":1101,"topicId":1100,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m floored at the number of members this list has in such a short time!

We&#39;ve been travelling and  partying <br/>\n(Cajun night tonight---those crayfish are in season, ya&#39; know!) and  <br/>\ngardening and swimming, and....well, this will keep up until it gets just *too*  hot <br/>\nto be outside. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe &quot;old farts&quot; that hang around here and answer your questions, well, I&#39;ve  <br/>\nmet most of them and I know their stories. But I have a few questions for you  <br/>\nnewbies. <br/>\n <br/>\nHow did y&#39;all find UnschoolingBasics? Were you referred here from another  <br/>\nlist? A friend? A website? Surfing?<br/>\n <br/>\nAre you coming to unschooling from attachment parenting----like Robyn and  <br/>\nRue and Deb? Or are you coming into it from a schooling background, like me  and <br/>\nPam and Ren?<br/>\n <br/>\nAre you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do you  <br/>\nfind it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational things?  <br/>\nOr do you want it as a lifestyle?<br/>\n <br/>\nWe want to keep this list as gentle as we can----because folks are here  &quot;for <br/>\nthe basics&quot;. But we started it because we are passionate about unschooling  <br/>\nand want to share it with as many people as possible (Free the Children, doncha <br/>\n know! &lt;g&gt;); so therefore our fingers can get a little &quot;passionate&quot; too!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe want you to feel comfortable enough to ask anything, but at the same  <br/>\ntime, to be accepting of all the answers you get. Each answer may not fit your  <br/>\nparticular situation, but there might be something there for the *next*  <br/>\nreader----so it&#39;s just as valuable, just not necessarily to *you*.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also want to invite everyone to SERIOUSLY consider the Live and Learn  <br/>\nUnschooling Conference which is being held in Peabody, MA this year----August  <br/>\n27-29. It&#39;s an absolutely incredible weekend FULL of unschoolers in action.  <br/>\nYou&#39;ll get to see many of the children we are talking about. Dads can talk with  <br/>\nother dads. Your kids can make new friends----some become e-pals and some  even <br/>\nget togetther during the year! You can connect with e-friends  IRL. And there <br/>\nare LOTS of fun things for ALL ages to do all weekend long!  It&#39;s <br/>\ninspirational! You&#39;ll go home full of ideas and confidence that what you&#39;re  doing is <br/>\nRIGHT and GOOD. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, to those of you clinging on to the edge of the pool, we&#39;re here in the  <br/>\nmiddle yelling. &quot;The water&#39;s FINE!&quot; We&#39;re fairly trustworthy. I promise!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1472,"nextTopicId":1573}}
