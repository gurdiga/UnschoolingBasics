So, if you are<br/>\ninclined to write a note supporting gentle parenting, I would<br/>\nappreciate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Christ Covenant Church has apparently hired a P.R. consultant,<br/>\nStelle Snyder, who is spinning this as &quot;not church sponsored&quot;. But,<br/>\nthe original response from the pastor, Gabe Sylvia, who directly<br/>\napproved it, took responsibility for bringing the Pearls to the church<br/>\nand embraced them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are their emails.
