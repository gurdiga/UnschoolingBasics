to &quot;you&#39;re the mom...who cares<br/>\nwhat he wants?&quot; to &quot;you&#39;re going to make him gay!&quot;) and when they see<br/>\npictures of him with peanut-butter head it just reinforces their argument.<br/>\nso i don&#39;t know how to deal with this.  if he would even just let me rinse<br/>\nhis hair i would probably be satisfied with that, but any water goes on his<br/>\nhead at all and he totally freaks out.  i could use some suggestions too if<br/>\nanyone has any, on how to make bathtime easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nas to your question, i wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  clearly you&#39;re more worried<br/>\nabout it than he is.  ok, that didn&#39;t sound nice but i didn&#39;t mean it in a<br/>\nmean way.  are you afraid it will reflect badly on you if his hair is long,<br/>\ngreasy, etc.?  maybe you could discuss the issue with him of what sort of<br/>\nimage we (sadly) project by what we look like and ask if he&#39;s comfortable<br/>\nwith people&#39;s judgments against him...and you.  if he is, i would just let<br/>\nit go.  eventually he&#39;ll probably get sick of it and he&#39;ll remember that you<br/>\nsupported his choice.  one thing you might suggest is baking soda.  during<br/>\nthe worst of my oily phases, especially camping, i&#39;d just pat my fingers in<br/>\nbaking soda, scrunch it up into my roots, then comb it out.  it sucks up the<br/>\noil and takes away any smell that might exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nhth,<br/>\nchandelle&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 4/12/07, Priscilla &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobcatpris2000@...\">bobcatpris2000@...</a>&gt;

We always wash his hair for him and we do it speedy quick with him screaming all the way but us assuring him with comforting words. We always have him tilt his head backwards so nothing gets on his face. Eventually, just by accident, we found that he was quite happy &#39;floating&#39; in the bath.  (he hates shower but loves the bath) And because he was &#39;floating&#39;, I&#39;ve convinced him to allow me to &#39;wash&#39; his hair quickly. In this instance, I don&#39;t bother shampoo but just quickly run my fingers thru his hair and scalp, as the water is already scented by a large aromatherapy fizzing &#39; bath bomb&#39;. His hair<br/>\n smells heavenly for the next few days. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So instead of trying to get son to wash his hair, maybe it might help if you offer to wash his hair for him, speedily and carefully? I think what&#39;s important for him is to find out that washing hair doesn&#39;t need to be scary and painful, which can be as shampoo in the eys do really sting. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  SharonC<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

DD, then 13, didn&#39;t want to bathe or wash hair. <br/>\nI put deodorant wipes and deodorant in the car which she was <br/>\nagreeable to use. She had been washing her hair before, but not <br/>\ncombing it out, putting it in a ponytail. When she stopped wanting <br/>\nto wash her hair, hats were available and she wore them. A couple of <br/>\nmonths ago we went somewhere and she changed her mind about getting <br/>\nout of the car because she said she felt like her hair was too oily, <br/>\nso we came home. Now she washes it whenever she thinks it needs it. <br/>\nAlso, she has chosen not to shave her armpits, but does Nair her <br/>\nlegs.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of months ago I went to &quot;no shampoo&quot; hair washing, using a <br/>\npaste of 2 tbsp of baking powder/water on my scalp and rinsing with <br/>\napple cider vinegar/water (yes, the smell washes completely out - <br/>\nyou just smell like an Easter egg for a minute!).

This","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-919571775\">One thing I noted is that you asked DS about it - why he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto wash his hair etc. - but you didn&#39;t ask DH about why he feels it <br/>\nis so important. This is a biggie that I have to always remind <br/>\nmyself about: treat my spouse as respectfully as I treat my child. <br/>\nSometimes we get into the habit of &quot;assuming&quot; that since partner is <br/>\nan adult, we don&#39;t have to discuss things the same way as we do with <br/>\nthe kid(s). That has ended up with my DH feeling unlistened to, less <br/>\nrespected, feelings hurt, etc. So, take a quiet time, perhaps away <br/>\nfrom your DS, and ask your DH why hair length, hair washing, etc is <br/>\nreally important to him, what in particular (the washing, the <br/>\nlength, other?) is the bigger problem in his eyes. It might simply <br/>\nbe that he wants an acknowledgement of his opinion and that&#39;s it <br/>\n(since you note he felt unheard). Maybe he&#39;s got it indoctrinated <br/>\ninto his head since childhood that &quot;only hippy drop out druggies <br/>\nhave long greasy hair&quot;. So, it&#39;s not so much -your individual child- <br/>\nthat is at issue as it is the idea of long greasy hair = &quot;loser&quot; or <br/>\nbad parenting or something. Once your DH is feeling heard and you <br/>\nare talking calmly, maybe bring in DS for a brainstorming session. <br/>\nDS wants X, DH would prefer Y, what kind of middle ground can you <br/>\nfind? For instance, maybe a dry wash thing (spritz it in, comb or <br/>\nbrush and done) would be minimally invasive for DS and remove enough <br/>\nof the greasiness for DH. Or, perhaps, DH wouldn&#39;t mind the not <br/>\nwashing as much if the hair was a little shorter, if that&#39;s okay to <br/>\nDS. And so on - remember, brainstorming is throw out all possible <br/>\nideas, eliminate/censor none of them to start with. So ideas like <br/>\nshave his head, grow dreadlocks, wear a helmet, go to a professional <br/>\nhair washer once a week, etc are all valid in brainstorming. I know <br/>\nmy DS (he&#39;s almost 9) doesn&#39;t like washing his hair much. However, <br/>\nhe does sometimes get an itchy scalp so, with his permission, I&#39;ll <br/>\nrun a damp washcloth over his scalp while he bathes. After all, the <br/>\nscalp is the major thing - hair doesn&#39;t produce oil, the oil glands <br/>\nin the scalp do. You might find that your DS would prefer to go to a <br/>\nhair salon place and have someone else do it for him (just because <br/>\nhe&#39;s 11 doesn&#39;t mean he *has to* do it for himself even though he <br/>\ncan). I know that for a while around that age, I preferred to have <br/>\nmy mom wash my long hair at the sink with the sink sprayer rather <br/>\nthan having bath water poured repeatedly over my head. All 3 of us <br/>\n(DH, me, DS) pretty much just let our hair grow 11 months of the <br/>\nyear, then get a shorter cut for the summer around May/June and let <br/>\nit grow again (though, since we&#39;re travelling to the Caribbean in <br/>\nthe fall this year, we&#39;ll probably do another short cut late in the <br/>\nsummer, it&#39;ll still be pretty hot down there). DH gets particularly <br/>\nshaggy - hair below collar length and beard down to midchest - <br/>\nbefore he trims and clips for the summer. And, since he is the at <br/>\nhome parent, he does sometimes go several days without showering or <br/>\nwashing his hair (and he&#39;s an adult). I still remember when I was a <br/>\nkid and we had a &quot;bath night&quot; once a week - none of this every <br/>\nsingle day showering and hair washing. That lasted until puberty <br/>\npretty much, at which point we *wanted* to shower and feel and smell <br/>\nclean. Also, your DS might be at cross purposes with himself - <br/>\nlonger hair is more likely to look and feel dirty and when washed <br/>\nget soap closer around the face. I know that my DS is often more <br/>\ncomfortable with shorter hair (clippers set at 3 on the side and 5 <br/>\non top for a mild buzz cut) that can just be washcloth washed <br/>\nquickly. Keep in mind, too, that your DS&#39; opinion on the subject may <br/>\nchange as the weather gets warmer and warmer - he may choose to trim <br/>\nhis hair a little at least and I know from experience (I&#39;ve had hair <br/>\nranging from shorter than collar to down to my belt) that clean, <br/>\nbrushed (at least a little) hair is way easier to pull back into a <br/>\ntail when it&#39;s hot out than tangled, greasy hair.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":258178542,"authorName":"sfenom11","from":"&quot;sfenom11&quot; &lt;sfenom11@...&gt;","profile":"sfenom11","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Dealing with a difference of opinion...","postDate":"1176255642","msgId":23111,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV2aGVhcStqN20wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23114,"prevInTime":23110,"nextInTime":23112,"topicId":23111,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi We re new to unschooling and I m still trying to convince my dh that RU is the way to go.
