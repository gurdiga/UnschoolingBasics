But maybe another  <br/>\ntime or two. Once was at a beach campout with homeschoolers and the  <br/>\nkids had a small water bottle with about an ounce of vodka and the  <br/>\nrest filled with orange juice and they passed that around among about  <br/>\n12 kids! So - maybe a couple of swallows is all she got. She didn&#39;t  <br/>\nlike it - but it wasn&#39;t enough to have any effect on her, anyway. The  <br/>\nmost recent time was at a college party - she decided to try it - and  <br/>\nshe got very sick and threw up.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe hasn&#39;t tried pot or other drugs - doesn&#39;t intend to. She&#39;s into  <br/>\nthe idea that the purpose of life is to expand our brainpower, to  <br/>\nlearn, to be fully conscious and experience every bit of life -- and  <br/>\nthe idea of drugs and alcohol dulling her senses is not attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other two, 18 and 15, are pretty much in the same frame of mind.  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t quite understand why it is attractive to other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey all have lots of friends who smoke pot and drink alcohol. They  <br/>\ngo to parties where there is alcohol. They tend to find other  <br/>\nnondrinkers to hang out with, though, don&#39;t stay at parties if they  <br/>\nare the only nondrinkers (because it isn&#39;t that much fun when other  <br/>\npeople drink too much) and they absolutely never ever get in the car  <br/>\nwith someone who has had even a small drink. We were hit by a drunk  <br/>\ndriver a few years ago and it was a traumatic experience - and now  <br/>\nthey think people who drink at all should not drive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve picked up my kids from parties at 2 or 3 in the morning - MANY  <br/>\ntimes, because they didn&#39;t want to get a ride home from anybody  <br/>\nthere, not being sure who had had a drink and who hadn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve picked up their friends who were drunk or stoned and needed  <br/>\nrides home, too. They all know they can call me and I&#39;ll cheerfully  <br/>\nget them - talk happily on the way home - not make them feel guilty  <br/>\nor anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got to this point by talking about it all very openly - I always  <br/>\nsaid that I totally understood why people do drugs or drink, that it  <br/>\nfeels good, helps people relax, releases inhibitions, etc. ! I never  <br/>\ncriticize other people for it. But we just don&#39;t do it at our house,  <br/>\never. No alcohol around. Lots of people have told us, over the years,  <br/>\nthat if we parents are so anti-alcohol that we are complete  <br/>\nabstainers, our kids will not learn to drink responsibly, etc. Like  <br/>\nwe should drink, even though we don&#39;t want to, so that our kids could  <br/>\nlearn how to drink moderately.   We didn&#39;t. I think alcohol is the  <br/>\ncause of so MUCH unhappiness in the world - I wish it would  <br/>\ndisappear. I don&#39;t want it regulated or prohibited,though, because i  <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel a need to impose my preferences on the rest of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 16, 2006, at 11:03 AM, Christy Putnam wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I am thinking the best route will be the<br/>\n&gt; same route we take with most everything, upfront and honest  <br/>\n&gt; discussion.

A lot. I drink very little now. Wine & beer <br/>\noccasionally. I&#39;ve never smoked anything---unusual for my age (46 in <br/>\nAugust). My husband, Ben, smoked pot in high school and drank a bit in <br/>\ncollege. He also drinks occasionally now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d love to say that all unschoolers stay away from alcohol and drugs. <br/>\nBut I&#39;m a realist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n But it can look different in our homes than in mainstream homes.<br/>\n<br/>\n When Cameron, at 14, started smoking pot, we had to think a bit! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n Ben was more alarmed than I was. I think he still is. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Cameron (now 18) is very comfortable talking to me about anything. I <br/>\nknow a lot of parents say that---or at least like to think that. I <br/>\n*know* it. We have some VERY serious and in-depth talks about drugs and <br/>\nsex and---everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know teens experiment. I did. My friends did. My concern was not <br/>\nwith the experimentation, but with the safety issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I wanted Cameron to know that I knew I couldn&#39;t stop him from smoking <br/>\nor drinking. And I also wanted him to know that his safety was the most <br/>\nimportant thing to me. I didn&#39;t want him buying cheap, dangerous stuff <br/>\n from people he didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t want him driving under the <br/>\ninfluence of anything. I didn&#39;t want him riding with someone who was <br/>\nDUI. I wanted him to be smart about what he was doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He did a lot of research on marijuana and hemp. (We all now own hemp <br/>\nbags and hats and stuff. &lt;g&gt;) He attended NORML meetings (although I <br/>\nsuggested he not sign anything there). He found people who grew organic <br/>\npot. He did NOT smoke and drive: he called us to pick him up (which we <br/>\ndid, happily and thankfully) or made travel arrangements ahead of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We discussed the illegalities and how it could jeopardize our <br/>\nunschooling. We discussed not smoking in the house or in front of his <br/>\nyounger brother. We discussed the ridiculous expense!<br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;s pretty much quit now. He says it makes him feel bad the next <br/>\nday---I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a hangover or what it is---but it&#39;s now not <br/>\nworth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think the honesty, trust, and respect in our relationship is <br/>\nimmeasurable and incredibly refreshing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Do I wish he&#39;d never smoked at all? Maybe, but he learned a lot about <br/>\na lot of things because he did.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And I&#39;d rather have that open, honest relationship with a (temporary) <br/>\npot-head than an estranged, resentful child who had never smoked at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting.
