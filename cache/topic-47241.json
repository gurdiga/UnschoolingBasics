The competition between the 11 and 7 yr old has become an <br/>\nissue.

How aware are you thinking she was? <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I thought about this sentence in the post I replied to: &quot;I know <br/>\neveryone wants what they can&#39;t have and longs for ideal things&quot; and I thought <br/>\nabout how much that doesn&#39;t play out in our day to day. Simon and Linnaea and <br/>\nDavid and I all seem fairly happy with what is. When there is something that we <br/>\nwant we work to make it happen. As long as it is within the realm of the <br/>\npossible. When it isn&#39;t in the realm of the possible, imagining it is usually <br/>\nenough, and it often turns comically dark. For example we were talking about a <br/>\ntoy store that reached the sky and where I had astronauts, Linnaea had <br/>\nasphyxiated children, laughter ensued. And usually once begun down a path of <br/>\nimagining it goes to unexpected places, little conversational meanderings. If it <br/>\nis in the realm of the possible, but due to finances or time may mean a delay <br/>\nbetween desire and action, there is a joy in anticipation, mostly. Sometimes the <br/>\nwaiting is harder than others, sometimes waiting makes it something that is no <br/>\nlonger desired. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am often overwhelmed by Simon&#39;s and/or Linnaea&#39;s lack of neediness. I can <br/>\nremember being offered to buy something, anything and almost never turning the <br/>\noffer down. I still feel that way, a bit, from time to time. Looking for <br/>\nsomething more in a gift then the item itself, maybe. As a teenager I was <br/>\nhopeful that the things advertised in Seventeen Magazine would make me beautful, <br/>\nwould make me better, would make me more than I already was. I&#39;ve never seen <br/>\nSimon or Linnaea experience the world that way. Both of them wanted more when <br/>\nthey were younger than they do now. Although what they get now costs more per <br/>\nitem, typically, what they wanted then was quantity. Linnaea wanted stuffed <br/>\nanimals, Simon wanted pokemon figures and action figures and pokemon games and <br/>\npokemon electronics. But now, mostly, they want little and if I offer them <br/>\nsomething they will turn it down. They have no sense, as far as I can tell, that <br/>\na purchase could improve who they are. Simon is interested in the idea of <br/>\nplaying an upright bass at the moment. He and his dad are almost done with <br/>\nbuilding a bottle bass guitar. My mom offered to buy him an upright bass and he <br/>\nturned her down. He said he didn&#39;t know that he was interested in it enough and <br/>\nthat he wanted to play with the bottle bass and see if he enjoyed that. I can&#39;t <br/>\neven imagine being 14 and turning down such an offer. Simon did it kindly and <br/>\neasily. Mom made sure he knew that he could change his mind. It was a generous <br/>\nand measured moment on both their parts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWanting something to be ideal is a different thing to wanting something you <br/>\ncan&#39;t have. Is your daughter becoming jaded? I think it is absolutely possible <br/>\nto move from a phase of feeling that nothing can be truly as good as you hope it <br/>\nwill be to a phase where things are wonderous as they are. It just takes time <br/>\nand support and experience. Looking for pleasure in small moments makes a big <br/>\ndifference to how my life is, to how each of our lives are. Yesterday Linnaea <br/>\nspent some small part of her day fascinated by a spider. Simon enjoyed the <br/>\ncruelty of his cat&#39;s claws. It wasn&#39;t a looking forward to or a loss through <br/>\nachievement. Although that can be a part of the disappointment. Sometimes the <br/>\nexcitement of something is mostly in the looking forward to it, the <br/>\nanticipation. And when you achieve it, when you have the thing that you were so <br/>\nexcited about, it is not nearly as much, not nearly as fulfilling as it might <br/>\nhave been. That&#39;s a hard thing to learn. Some folks don&#39;t ever figure out the <br/>\nbalance or that sometimes anticipation is in itself a pleasure. At 7 your <br/>\ndaughter probably just needs commiseration and support and things to enjoy that <br/>\ndon&#39;t pale. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":335624523,"authorName":"strange_translation","from":"&quot;strange_translation&quot; &lt;senlin_says@...&gt;","profile":"strange_translation","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Happy?","postDate":"1315871132","msgId":47253,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0bTVpcytibWE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRTNGQTE1MkQzRURERC0yMzUwLTI1NkVGQFdlYm1haWwtZDEyMi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47252,"nextInTopic":47254,"prevInTime":47252,"nextInTime":47254,"topicId":47241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for your advice.

Any suggestions? <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: &quot;Lauren McLaughlin&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lmclaughlin@...\">lmclaughlin@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nCc: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, September 10, 2011 1:35:02 AM <br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Happy? <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your wonderful post, Meredith.

Picture basic physical survival needs like water,food, <br/>\nsleep, breathing on the bottom rung so that you can&#39;t skip over it <br/>\neasily to care about satisfying higher needs (social interaction, <br/>\ncuriosity, understanding the world) until you feel physically satisfied <br/>\nand reasonably confident that you can turn attention upward to other <br/>\nneeds. This will take whatever it takes and however long it takes, <br/>\ndiffering by person. And it&#39;s a two-way ladder, not straight up. You <br/>\nhave to keep stepping back down to the lowest rung where a critical need <br/>\nrecurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking what the bottom rung feels like for a child with asthma, <br/>\nfor example. (Or the day my 13-month-old almost drowned -- nothing else <br/>\nmattered that day or for a long time after that, to us, except that he <br/>\nkeep breathing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo traditional parenting and schooling and churching manipulates how <br/>\nkids climb their own needs ladder, on purpose and thinking it&#39;s for <br/>\ntheir own good -- we set up competitions from birth (first steps <br/>\nliterally, potty training, bedtime s, eating vegetables) and standardize <br/>\nall sorts of little tricks for them to perform on schedule and for us to <br/>\n&quot;judge&quot; and score, demanding that even &quot;late climbers&quot; learn to hop <br/>\naround on the rungs to impress adults, pass tests, get into presitigious <br/>\nprograms . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s counterproductive, because in Maslow&#39;s theory, a need left <br/>\nonly party fulfilled creates and imprints the individual with anxiety <br/>\nsurrounding that need. This is Maslow&#39;s definition of &quot;neurosis&quot; -- <br/>\nfixating on an unmet need -- and the the problem is that filling such a <br/>\nneed later will be pretty much impossible, once the ladder-climber has <br/>\nlearned from experience to fear rather than feel confident about <br/>\nsatisfying that need.<br/>\n<br/>\n From <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html\">http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html</a> --<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you have significant problems along your development -- a period of <br/>\nextreme insecurity or hunger as a child, or the loss of a family member <br/>\nthrough death or divorce, or significant neglect or abuse -- you may <br/>\n“fixate” on that set of needs for the rest of your life.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Happy?","postDate":"1315672136","msgId":47245,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0ZzM4OCtucDdoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0ZHRmcCs2YXUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47244,"nextInTopic":47246,"prevInTime":47244,"nextInTime":47246,"topicId":47241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What is it exactly that she is getting angry and unhappy about?
