But I LOVED that movie, Cast away.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it a half dozen times. I had to speak regarding this product <br/>\nplacement nonsense (my opinion)! <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there were actual brand names mentioned repeatedly (notably FedEx <br/>\nand Wilson, as discussed), however, looking at the whole story, rather <br/>\nthan pulling out of context the mere fact of these logo&#39;s presence, <br/>\nmisses the point of a piece of great storytelling.  Tom Hanks starts out <br/>\nthe vision of FedEx-ness, yes, but by the end he has left that life <br/>\ncompletely, and for the better.  He has Cast Away that entire life, the <br/>\nlife he thought was so important and central--comically so!--and become <br/>\nsomething more stripped down and real.  Same with Wilson, his buddy.  He <br/>\nhas to LET GO of Wilson in order to survive.  He has to let go of all of <br/>\nit, all the attachments to stuff, in order to live and become who he <br/>\nwill become--a person who can freely choose what path he wants at the <br/>\ncrossroads in the end.  That is clearly a message antithetical to &#39;buy <br/>\nfedex because you saw the brandname logo a couple dozen times.&#39;  That <br/>\nstory-truth is MUCH more impacting, I think, than any supposed product <br/>\nplacement could ever be.  I think of that scene where he habitually does <br/>\nthe &#39;sort&#39; with the washed up packages and these items he has described <br/>\nas being &#39;the golden egg&#39; are so ridiculously banal, it makes the whole <br/>\nfed-ex mythos seem silly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be a great loss, I think, to throw out movies and tv that <br/>\naccomplish story telling of this quality, because of a fear of being <br/>\noverly influenced by some possible logo placement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I just had to get that off my chest.  Thanks if you actually read <br/>\nthis far!<br/>\nMayaA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25339,"nextTopicId":25373}}
