You don&#39;t know how people who&#39;ve always had freedom  <br/>\nbehave. You only know how people who have been controlled act when  <br/>\ngiven freedom. You  only know how people who&#39;ve been left to raise  <br/>\nthemselves act when given freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a wicked important realization. You can&#39;t project what you know  <br/>\nof  human behavior onto kids who&#39;ve always known freedom because you  <br/>\nonly know the behavior of controlled humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve spent 12 years learning that lectures and textbooks are  <br/>\ndull and hard, then college looks like 4 more years of the same. If  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve spent 12 years exploring all sorts of different ways to learn  <br/>\nand college is a self-chosen way to continue exploring, then lectures  <br/>\nand textbooks are just a part of the package.<br/>\n<br/>\nKat&#39;s been taking college courses since she was 12 and hasn&#39;t had any  <br/>\nproblems with the format. That doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will have  <br/>\nthe same experience.

More than kids who&#39;ve been  <br/>\ncramming textbooks into their head for 12 years and haven&#39;t had a  <br/>\nchance to experience life to figure out what they want to do,  <br/>\ncolleges like older students who&#39;ve been out in the workforce, who  <br/>\nare clearly focused on where they want to go.

Then, with the ensuing chaos and lack of<br/>\nconsideration, parents throw up their hands and blame the crazy<br/>\nradical unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, the terms I find more closely allied with what we do in<br/>\nour family are autonomy and organic learning. We&#39;re really not<br/>\n&quot;radical&quot; people--well, yeah we are in some ways, but we&#39;re probably<br/>\nmore flaky than anything else. *bwg* Both of those terms--autonomy and<br/>\norganic learning--seem to more accurately reflect the gentleness and<br/>\nfree-form nature of how we interact. While we don&#39;t do rules, we do<br/>\nhave personal limits and boundaries and preferences--*all* of us,<br/>\nincluding the kids--and those are constantly being articulated,<br/>\nnegotiated and renegotiated during our lives with each other. As one<br/>\nof our limits bumps up against another&#39;s desire, we have the<br/>\nopportunity for learning and growing--learning about each other,<br/>\nourselves, communicating, stretching, thinking, problem-solving. That,<br/>\nto me, is one of the biggest differences between living a life with<br/>\nrules and living a life that respects each individual&#39;s autonomy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when one person bumps up against another&#39;s personal<br/>\nboundaries really hard, then the reaction can be just as dramatic.<br/>\nCertainly that&#39;s no one&#39;s goal, but it occasionally happens, just as<br/>\nit occasionally happens with a spouse or roommate or someone else with<br/>\nwhom we live in close proximity.

Maybe the person really crossed a<br/>\nline and the intensity of the reaction gives them opportunity to<br/>\nreflect and consider in a safe space; maybe the person who reacted was<br/>\nreacting to more than the immediate situation--past situations or<br/>\nissues perhaps bubbled to the surface, giving that person opportunity<br/>\nto dig back and process old issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunication, learning, growing, problem-solving, consideration,<br/>\nrespect, autonomy, flexibility, trust...these are the words that<br/>\ndescribe our process, not &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94040812,"authorName":"Lisa H","from":"&quot;Lisa H&quot; &lt;Lmanathome@...&gt;","profile":"lmanathome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Radical unschooling","postDate":"1130120208","msgId":7192,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1EQVYxMjdERDAxOTEyNDJEQjA3QkJGOTZFRDE3NzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":7181,"nextInTopic":27663,"prevInTime":7191,"nextInTime":7193,"topicId":7162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1565101167\">&lt;&lt;Kelly wrote:  It means trusting our children to be the best people they can---and knowing that they are trying to do that *all* the time. <br/>\nIt means respecting them as full, whole people---even as newborns and toddlers and tweens and teens---NOT just after they turn 25 or become parents themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means being patient when they aren&#39;t at that &quot;certain point&quot; when we or others expect them to be.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd taking it outside the home.
