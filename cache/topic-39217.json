If you want to talk abuse within that context, people can be plenty mean and rotten with a Please or Thank You on their lips.

But the scenario you threw out the first time was a child saying &quot;I want ice cream&quot; - not overstimulated, not freaking out, not mean, not abusive. Maybe all wrapped up in what he or she is doing and so not being as gracious as possible - its Okay for kids to not always be as gracious as possible. They get better at being consistently gracious when they live in an environment where graciousness is a regular occurrance. More than modelling, the graciousness meets some of their emotional needs and makes it Easier for them to be gracious, themselves. Replying by saying &quot;oh, you want ice cream, great&quot; doesn&#39;t meet any needs, doesn&#39;t help anything, doesn&#39;t even model anything but being snarky to a loved one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I want to address the topic of natural consequences. If you change the natural consequence of your childs action in the name of &quot;safety&quot; or &quot;respect&quot; are you really unschooling them? Or are you creating a false sense of the world around them just as surely as if you had created a punishment for them for something you felt was out of line?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where its really important to have a good grasp of your own guiding principles - those values that actually motivate your behavior. When you clear the way to live by your principles, some of your reactions will change. That&#39;s a good thing - its you being more true to your self. But it complicates the whole question of &quot;natural consequences&quot; because some &quot;natural&quot; reactions are animal reactions and some are habits, knee-jerk reactions of thought and feeling. Part of clearing the way to live by your principles involves learning to Not default to those more basic reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, this is all very theoretical, let me try to give an example of what I mean. My frustration is sometimes a natural consequence of my kids&#39; actions - but I also have a very strong guiding principle of kindness. Sometimes its Kind to let my kids know the extent of my frustration. Its useful information about me, about the world and how their behavior effects other people. Other times my frutration isn&#39;t a terribly kind or useful piece of information. Then its better if I take some deep breaths and Deal without dishing my own issues up to my kids. In either case, I&#39;m expressing my deepest intent of being kind to the people around me - but in one case I&#39;m providing a &quot;natural consequence&quot; and in another, I&#39;m not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of being true to principles, rather than relying on rules or even guidelines like &quot;natural consequences&quot; is that you end up being more consistent in ways that are more tangible. That sounds backwards, doesn&#39;t it? But its something I&#39;ve seen over and over in my family, at work, and heard many similar stories from other longtime unschoolers. Kindness is a tangible thing - its gentle words and hands and food and hugs when they&#39;re needed and feeling confident and loved and supported. All those things are tangible - felt in the body itself. And when That is consistent, then kids (and adults too) feel loved and respected and able to be kind in return. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Forcing a &quot;please&quot; or an &quot;ask nicely&quot;","postDate":"1238799655","msgId":39297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyNjRmNytmbW5mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE4OTc3LjcyNzY2LnFtQHdlYjUyMDExLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39295,"nextInTopic":39298,"prevInTime":39296,"nextInTime":39298,"topicId":39217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************************** There are people I don t hang out with very much anymore, at least when the kids are with me, bc they re rude to my kids.

I stay away from people who piss Me off, why shouldn&#39;t my kids have the same option? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, there are plenty of people in the world who are rude to children (or just plain rude). We don&#39;t live in a bubble, so my kids get to meet people who are condescending or didactic or try to order them around or quiz them on a fairly regular basis. I help the kids out as best I can, stepping in when necessary, diffusing the situation, changing the subject, even &quot;getting into it&quot; with the other adult sometimes (which I Don&#39;t recommend, but it happens). My kids have learned many of the same skills - they&#39;re great at changing the subject and finding ways to diffuse situations where adults are being weird. They have great initiative and problem solving skills and they know I&#39;ve &quot;got their back&quot; so to speak. They also know that I can make a royal mess of things in their defense! So they&#39;ve seen a whole lot of social problem solving, and will see plenty more, I&#39;m sure. They aren&#39;t &quot;sheltered&quot; in that sense - I just don&#39;t dump them in situations that we all know up front will be unpleasant. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts an example of the principle of setting kids up for success whenever possible. Kids learn more and better social skills by witnessing a higher percentage of graciousness and kindness and active courtesy all &#39;round than they do from having adults be rude to them for the sake of &quot;teaching courtesy&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Yet, they are also being exposed to the idea that there are different behaviours expected in different places. This occurs for us as a family when we take our children (ages 4 and 6) to theater performances or out to restaurants. If they are feeling rambunctious, I happily get up and take them outside.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do this too. I also try to let the kids know about expectations beforehand - movies and theater have an expectation of quiet, that sort of thing. That&#39;s more of the same principle of setting things up for success.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, there are places we don&#39;t go very often bc I know its a strain, at best, for my kids to Meet the expectations of the space. We didn&#39;t take Ray grocery shopping for years bc he just couldn&#39;t meet the expectations of stores - not climbing the shelves and displays was just more than he could handle without having someone to race up and down the aisles with... and that really makes it hard to shop. I don&#39;t take Mo to libraries anymore when other children are likely to be present bc she reads to other children and in our small town libraries that&#39;s a problem for reasons that escape me entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that he&#39;s 15, Ray doesn&#39;t have any problem going grocery shopping or even to exciting places like Home Depot without climbing the displays - so its not like he never learned how to behave. But he didn&#39;t have to have the experience of being told &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot; a zillion times to learn it. When he was ready, we could say &quot;the people who work here get nervous when customers do things like that&quot; and that was enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo a large extent, courtesy, true courtesty anyway, is a function of empathy. That&#39;s something that can&#39;t be taught, but it can be nurtured. The more one has a sense of innate personal worth, the more readily that empathy is accessible and the more one behaves graciously. That&#39;s true of kids and adults. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Forcing a &quot;please&quot; or an &quot;ask nicely&quot;","postDate":"1238797543","msgId":39295,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyNjJkNytobmZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3MDM2My4xNzExOS5xbUB3ZWI1MjAwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39287,"nextInTopic":39297,"prevInTime":39294,"nextInTime":39296,"topicId":39217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********************************* Relationships can exist without manipulation.

Certainly its possible to view every human interaction as being about power, or manipulation, or control - but its equally possible to see human interactions from a different viewpoint, one with no locus of control at all. Radical unschooling contains a whole different paradigm of human relationships, starting with parents and children, but expanding beyond that. Beyond power or control or manipulation, love and respect still exist, but they look a little different.

I don&#39;t shove my parenting philosophy down the throat of everyone I meet and I don&#39;t appreciate it when others do it to me.

When it happens, she<br/>\nsays Ouch, helps baby relatch, and moves on, without lecturing the child on<br/>\nwhat it means to nurse &quot;kindly&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you change the natural consequence of your childs action in the name <br/>\n&gt; of &quot;safety&quot; or &quot;respect&quot; are you really unschooling them? Or are you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>creating <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a false sense of the world around them just as surely as if you had<br/>\n </span></blockquote>created a <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; punishment for them for something you felt was out of line?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just let go of any idea of Natural Consequences.  You won&#39;t find many people<br/>\nhere who want to discuss it, because it&#39;s just a mainstream way for people<br/>\nto coercively train/teach/mold their children without the guilt baggage that<br/>\ncomes with *knowing* that punishments and rewards harm children but *using*<br/>\nthem anyway.  I think that reading Alfie Kohn&#39;s book Punished by Rewards<br/>\nwould help your thinking in this area a LOT.  The first sentence in the<br/>\nquote above shows how muddy and misguided Natural Conseqence thinking is.<br/>\nIf I could &quot;change the natural consequence&quot; of my child&#39;s action, what is it<br/>\nthat&#39;s making it &quot;natural&quot;?????  If you can &quot;change the consequence&quot;, how is<br/>\nthat not another way of saying that YOU decide the appropriate consequence<br/>\n(punishment or reward) depending on your own beliefs and morals and world<br/>\nview?  Unschoolers recognize that true &quot;natural consequences&quot; are<br/>\nobjectively &quot;natural&quot;.  Skinned knees from a fall off a skateboard is a<br/>\nnatural consequence.  That&#39;s a solo act by my child, no input on my part.<br/>\nOnce the parental actors are involved, choosing and deciding on the best<br/>\n&quot;natural&quot; consequence, it&#39;s simply coercive living with a fancy feel-good<br/>\nname.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if this bubble is appropriate or if like the Prince/Princess <br/>\n&gt; kept in the castle my children will feel horribly mislead as to the<br/>\n </span></blockquote>reality <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of the world at large?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So we should punish our kids a little bit sometimes so they&#39;ll be used to it<br/>\nwhen they&#39;re out there on their own?  The majority of society believes that.<br/>\nBut definitely not Unschoolers.  We choose joy over fears and concerns about<br/>\nhow the future might look.  Tomorrow doesn&#39;t exist.  When you get there,<br/>\nit&#39;s Today.  We never see tomorrow.  We make joyful choices in our<br/>\ninteractions TODAY, trusting that it&#39;s the most JOYFUL and most FUN way to<br/>\ndeal with a simple natural consequence of life:  our complete inability to<br/>\npredict the future.  There is no &quot;world at large&quot; that my son will<br/>\nexperience someday.  He&#39;s living in his &quot;world at large&quot; right now, daily.<br/>\nHe&#39;s a full-bore human being experiencing life, today, now.  I&#39;m not<br/>\npreparing him for a later nebulous/maybe/what-if reality.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn Coburn said the following about unschooling, and I love these words so<br/>\nmuch I have them printed and taped to my wall above my PC so I can marinate<br/>\nin them frequently (I&#39;m pretty sure I found the quote on sandradodd.com a<br/>\nfew months back):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The idea of Unschooling is for parents to be the facilitators of options,<br/>\nthe openers of doors, the creators of environments of freedom, and the<br/>\nguardians of choice, not the installers of roadblocks and barriers.<br/>\nUnschoolers are making the huge and wonderful choice to renounce our legal<br/>\nentitlements to be the authoritarian controllers of our children&#39;s lives,<br/>\nand instead choose to be their partners.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to delve into unschooling thought more, an excellent way to do<br/>\nit is to go to this page:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOn the top right, there&#39;s a &quot;Go to a random page&quot; link.

You&#39;re very close to the mainstream<br/>\ntrunk of the tree.  But the end does NOT justify the means.  In this<br/>\nscenario, the doctor was being manipulative.  He was trying to get the<br/>\ndaughter to do a trained-animal act.  Manipulation is disrespectful.  The<br/>\ndegree to which you manipulate someone is the degree to which you disrespect<br/>\nthem.  My parents truly, intensely, honestly believed that spanking me was<br/>\ndoing me a great service.  It was saving me from embarrassing them in<br/>\npublic, getting into trouble, or being a sinner that might end up in hell.<br/>\nTheir &quot;end&quot; goal was completely justified in their mind, so they could use<br/>\nwhatever means necessary to achieve that goal.  And in the process they<br/>\ndisrespected me, a lot.  My desires and learning needs were rarely<br/>\nconsidered.  It wasn&#39;t kind, and it didn&#39;t help me much, and in many ways<br/>\nI&#39;m still undoing the damage, 25 years after leaving their home at age 17.<br/>\nInteractions in your home that have the intention of molding or &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>\nyour child to behave a certain way to meet your (or society&#39;s) expectations<br/>\nis doing damage to your child and to your relationship with your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is the best parenting scenario to remove all such people from our <br/>\n&gt; childrens world or to teach them how to interact with such people <br/>\n&gt; while retaining their dignity and true selves? I&#39;m really asking as <br/>\n&gt; I haven&#39;t quite come to my own conclusion here.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As you discover unschooling more, you&#39;ll understand that unschoolers only<br/>\nvery rarely use the verb &quot;to teach&quot;.  Anytime you find yourself saying it,<br/>\nif you&#39;ll substitute the verb &quot;to learn&quot;, your progress toward understanding<br/>\nunschooling will be much quicker.  I don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; my child how to interact<br/>\nwith people.  He learns it.  I can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him this in the same way I<br/>\ncan&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him to walk or talk or throw a toy or put on his shirt.  He<br/>\nwatched others doing it (including me) and he learned how to do these things<br/>\nin his own way, at his own time.  Anytime you use the word &quot;teach&quot;, it has a<br/>\ntop-down, &quot;I know more than you, and I want to impart my knowledge to you so<br/>\nyou&#39;ll retain it and act in the ways I find acceptable.&quot;  Teaching is icky<br/>\nand schoolish.  If a friend, or even my own wife, tries to &quot;teach&quot; me a<br/>\nlesson they think is important, it&#39;s going to create space and friction in<br/>\nthe relationship.  Kids are no different.  Unschooling looks for the ways to<br/>\neliminate space...to foster closer, intimate, open relationships where<br/>\ncommunication can flow easily.  I am not my son&#39;s teacher.  I am not my<br/>\nson&#39;s boss.  I am his partner, guide, and helper.  I have 38 more years of<br/>\nexperience on this planet than he does, so there are many things I can help<br/>\nhim with.  The key is that I give him this help when he wants it, now when I<br/>\n(or society, or any &quot;social&quot; or &quot;community&quot; contracts, or any other external<br/>\nexpectations) wants it.  And, moment to moment, so far in his 4 years I<br/>\nthink that I, personally, have learned far more *from him* than he&#39;s learned<br/>\nfrom me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am proposing that if you do not treat each other in your <br/>\n&gt; family with the level of respect and politeness that is inherent in the <br/>\n&gt; social contract that is followed in your community that there will be <br/>\n&gt; natural consequences to your children when they are not aware or able <br/>\n&gt; to behave in a way that is deemed approriate. I feel that&#39;s it&#39;s unfair <br/>\n&gt; to not teach your children that there are expected behaviours inherent <br/>\n&gt; in certain situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This type of thinking is not helpful to unschooling.  Not in any way at all.<br/>\nIt&#39;s yet another example of &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;.  It&#39;s a quick<br/>\nslippery slope from &quot;natural consequences&quot; to spankings with a belt.  My<br/>\nparents spanked me with love and the authority of God, doing their best to<br/>\nmold me since they believed it was necessary.  Children do not need<br/>\nmolding!!  Children need love and help.  Let go of any thoughts about<br/>\n&quot;natural consequences&quot;, because it&#39;s simply one more mainstream euphemism<br/>\nfor &quot;teaching a lesson&quot;.  The father who runs over his kid&#39;s bicycle with<br/>\nhis car instead of looking behind the car before cranking it can easily<br/>\njustify it, saying that the broken bike is a &quot;natural consequence&quot; of the<br/>\nchild irresponsibly leaving the bicycle behind the car.  &quot;If I hadn&#39;t run<br/>\nover my kid&#39;s bicycle, he&#39;d have left something else (maybe bigger or more<br/>\nexpensive or more important) behind the car at a later point.  So by me<br/>\nbeing coercive and unkind now, I&#39;m teaching him how to act more responsibly<br/>\nin the future.&quot;  Our societal ideas of &quot;natural consequences&quot; are icky and<br/>\nmean and disrespectful.  It&#39;s in the exact same category as timeouts or any<br/>\nother &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; form of coercion, manipulation, and &quot;children are<br/>\nnot fully humans yet so we have to mold them&quot; thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe their are plenty of ways to teach <br/>\n&gt; politeness without manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One unschooling way to say this would be:<br/>\nThere are plenty of ways for my children to learn politeness without me<br/>\nimposing onto them my fears about failing to meet a social contract or<br/>\nexpectation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBehavior is communication.  Trying to change my child&#39;s behavior is usually<br/>\nan attempt to stifle communication that I am not ready or willing to hear.<br/>\nListening to and observing the behavior helps me understand the underlying<br/>\ndesires my child has, that he doesn&#39;t have the English vocabulary to<br/>\ncommunicate to me.  It&#39;s incredibly easy to give the benefit of the doubt to<br/>\nan infant who can&#39;t speak at all, and whose crying or writhing we listen to,<br/>\nand we easily meet their needs for warmth or food or whatever.  When your<br/>\nchild is 4 or 6, their communication via behavior is just as critical.<br/>\nListen to it, instead of requiring them to change it so they fit into any<br/>\nkind of parental or societal mold. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Forcing a &quot;please&quot; or an &quot;ask nicely&quot;","postDate":"1238762637","msgId":39267,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwNDAzMDU0M281MTA3MjZhMWkzNjMxZTlhN2EzOThjMmFjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3MDM2My4xNzExOS5xbUB3ZWI1MjAwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGdyMTR1cisxZnZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDc3MDM2My4xNzExOS5xbUB3ZWI1MjAwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":39260,"nextInTopic":39270,"prevInTime":39266,"nextInTime":39268,"topicId":39217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ********I feel like withholding is manipulation.

I&#39;m really asking as I haven&#39;t quite come to my own conclusion here.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Granted I think 5 is young to be pushed out into the world without a mediator IF I had been in that situation I would have been on my knees in front of my daughter at eye level and been actively mediating between the Doctor and her. My husband and I choose to treat each person in our family with a high degree of politeness and respect and so this particular incident hasn&#39;t come up in this way for us. <br/>\n<br/>\n** Doctor offices beget the issue of personal space for us. I state my expectation that each of the staff introduce themselves to my children, explain what they are doing as they are doing it to my children and ask my childrens permission before touching them in any way. If my children refuse the staff to touch them I ask if I can hold the stethoscope or whatever and if the nurse refuses then we skip that part of the exam.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Trying to force a &quot;please&quot; is so rude really. I&#39;m trying to think of a<br/>\nSINGLE incident as an adult, in which someone tried to make me say<br/>\n&quot;please&quot; for any reason whatsover. I can&#39;t think of ONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt work, if I want a mint that a co-worker might have (thinking of an<br/>\nexample that comes up frequently) the exchange usually goes something<br/>\nlike: &quot;Hey Misty, can I have one of your mints?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;sure, go ahead&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thanks!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNObody manipulates anyone to ask a certain way. It&#39;s really NOT<br/>\nacceptable for adults to treat each other that way in our society. If<br/>\nan adult withheld something from another adult and tried to extract a<br/>\n&quot;please&quot; it would seem VERY strange.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is your experience and you are blessed to have had it. That is not my experience. Happened to me all the time. Still occasionally happens to me. I&#39;m 35 yrs old.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two theories I have about that: <br/>\n1. You live in a diffent location than I do and your local customs and social contract are different than where I live.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I am/was possibly such a rude and insufferable bitch that people feel/felt compelled to go out of their way to correct me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to entertain either one as equally as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Children are often treated as inferior beings, who need to be molded<br/>\nand &quot;taught&quot; but we&#39;re here to talk about a different way to BE and<br/>\nlive with children. Trying to manipulate manners is just one such thing<br/>\nwe question and try to find better solutions for.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly true. I am proposing that if you do not treat each other in your family with the level of respect and politeness that is inherent in the social contract that is followed in your community that there will be natural consequences to your children when they are not aware or able to behave in a way that is deemed approriate. I feel that&#39;s it&#39;s unfair to not teach your children that there are expected behaviours inherent in certain situations. My childrens Grandparents take them to church occasionally and they have learned that there is an expected way for them to act in certain places of the church. The Mormon church is extremely family oriented, they provide places for children to run amok during services so I have no qualms with my children going there. <br/>\nI know they will be treated kindly and with respect to their needs. Yet, they are also being exposed to the idea that there are different behaviours expected in different places. This occurs for us as a family when we take our children (ages 4 and 6) to theater performances or out to restaurants. If they are feeling rambunctious, I happily get up and take them outside. For the past few years my daughter has been enamored with tea parties, I happily go all out bringing out small glass teapots, cubed sugar in crystal bowls with tongs, small glass cups and cloth tablecloths and napkins for your lap. We put on costumes and airs, we act overly pompous and overly polite, we pretend to gossip and giggle. Now I&#39;ve started to take my little 4 yr old to actual tea houses and she LOVES IT! <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe their are plenty of ways to teach politeness without manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and Laughter,<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nsnugglebugg.com/sagepixie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Song for a Fifth Child.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMother, oh Mother,<br/>\n<br/>\ncome shake out your cloth,<br/>\n<br/>\nempty the dustpan,<br/>\n<br/>\npoison the moth,<br/>\n<br/>\nhang out the washing<br/>\n<br/>\nand butter the bread,<br/>\n<br/>\nsew on a button and make up a bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is the mother whose house<br/>\n<br/>\nis so shocking?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s up in the nursery,<br/>\n<br/>\nblissfully rocking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I&#39;ve grown shiftless as Little<br/>\n<br/>\nBoy Blue (lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>\n<br/>\n(pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shopping&#39;s not done<br/>\n<br/>\nand there&#39;s nothing for stew<br/>\n<br/>\nand out in the yard there&#39;s a hullabaloo<br/>\n<br/>\nbut I&#39;m playing Kanga and this is my Roo.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook!

If they&#39;re not in the<br/>\nmood to be nice, you don&#39;t give them what they ask? You give it to<br/>\nthem, but with a reminder to ask nicely next time?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is a subtle distinction between what some may consider &quot;not being nice&quot; and abuse. I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about rushing to the side of a tired or overstimulated or off mood person to help them get their needs met. I do not allow anyone (even my own mother) to scream at me, kick me, hit me, bite me, in order for me to go get them something. This first came up for me as a parent when my children where months old breast feeding and got teeth in. Occasionally they would become over excited, angry or sometimes just a burst of fiesty and bite me hard while breastfeeding, I would OUCH! (as a natural reaction not a manipulative ploy) remove my breast from their mouth and say in a firm but gentle voice that when you love someone you treat them with kindness, that I do not like to be bitten, biting is not being kind. What happened from an outside perspective is that IF you bite Mommy you don&#39;t get your num nums. After a few times I<br/>\n didn&#39;t get bit anymore. <br/>\nThis could be construed as deliberate manipulation and if I had planned to scream Ouch! startle my child remove them from the breast and sooth with an explanation about being nice that would be true, however, it wasn&#39;t. The scenario played out from my honest gut reaction. To my understanding that puts it in the area of natural consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children are simply out of sorts and yell at me to get them something... I can&#39;t think of a time that they did that recently... Ok last night they were both over tired, screaming and chasing each other through the house and literally running into walls out of tiredness. My husband and I had decided to watch a movie together and didn&#39;t realize that it was a 2 hr movie and not a 1hr movie. We were all well beyond tired. I had missed their cues. I had not been attentive enough and now I had to help them transition into sleep mode. I caught the youngest one to check her head after she had bounced off a wall and said probably too loudly &quot;That&#39;s it! No more tag!&quot; My husband came around the corner and said &quot;Amy, they are really tired, you are really tired.&quot; I immediately changed my tone and said &quot;Lets play GO TO SLEEP!&quot; at which my children laughed. We made a game out of making up the bed (as it had recently been torn apart in play) We made a game out<br/>\n of brushing their teeth. We sang a song about picking out books to read. Then I snuggled in between them while I read and then until after they fell well asleep. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that when my 4 y/o son is in a mood where he&#39;s less likely<br/>\nto say Please or Thank You, or is simply busy with his play or other<br/>\nthings and too distracted to say Please, that&#39;s the time that me acting<br/>\n*more* quickly and *more* friendly when he asks for something<br/>\nstrengthens our relationship and keeps communication open and flowing.<br/>\nBehavior is communication of my son&#39;s internal world, so I have no<br/>\ndesire to squelch negativity or mold him to act the way I want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above quote struck me as similar to &quot;I reward good behavior with<br/>\nfaster and more friendly service, and punish poor behavior by<br/>\nresponding more slowly with non-friendly service.&quot; I&#39;m not sure if that<br/>\nwas the writer&#39;s intent. If so, it could have a negative effect in your<br/>\nrelationships and hinder unschooling. It feels like behavior<br/>\nmodification techniques on some level, to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve never required my children to say please. I do let them know that a please is appreciated. We do also call it a &#39;magic word&#39; because it can, out in the big wide world, change a no to yes. Also from the time my children were infants and I was holding up toys for them to choose, I would say &quot;Yes, Please&quot; or &quot;No, Thank you&quot; it has always been part of the response. It is how we speak in our house. When I ask my husband to grab me something while he&#39;s in the kitchen I say &quot;Honey, could you please...&quot; and when he brings me something I say thank you. When I ask the kids to grab something I say &quot;Darling, could you please...&quot; and then &quot;thank you&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are never asked to repress their feelings. If they are angry they can be angry, or sad, or whatever. They do occasionally yell at me and I do occasionally yell at them, and then we apologize because yelling at someone is not very loving and I love them. I&#39;ve never asked my children to apologize to me for yelling at me but they always do because I always have to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am all for treating my children with loving kindess. I try very hard not to impose consequences upon them. They have complete freedom to eat, sleep, paint, scream and yell and snuggle as they feel the need. I do my best to help them recognize their own feelings and symptoms of being hungry or tired. If they have been playing and are getting cranky I will bring them a snack and notice out loud that sometimes when I get hungry I also get grumpy. When they are getting sleepy I say &quot;Hey&#39; you seem to be yawning and rubbing your eyes, are you feeling sleepy? do you want to go to bed and snuggle or do you want to rest out here in the living room?&quot; when they are getting angry I say &quot;My your voice is getting loud and your hands are clenched into balls you seem angry.Can I help you with something?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nContext is very important when we have these discussions. Behavior modification techniques were developed from watching cause and effect during interpersonal relationships between people. Behavior modification techniques fail because they take the underlying respect and love that drove those natural behaviors and distorts it with manipulation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to address the topic of natural consequences. If you change the natural consequence of your childs action in the name of &quot;safety&quot; or &quot;respect&quot; are you really unschooling them? Or are you creating a false sense of the world around them just as surely as if you had created a punishment for them for something you felt was out of line?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gone out of my way to surround myself and my children with people who treat us with kindness and respect. This has occured naturally as a response to not allowing people to treat me with what I believe is abuse. I have done this so effectively that on the chance encounter I have with someone who believes that saying &quot;Hey Jerkface, Whatcha been up to?&quot; is a proper way to great friends or family member I am shocked and appalled. If it weren&#39;t for those random encounters I would have forgotten that some people use abusive language and hitting each other as terms of endearment. I wonder if this bubble is appropriate or if like the Prince/Princess kept in the castle my children will feel horribly mislead as to the reality of the world at large?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and Laughter,<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy<br/>\n<br/>\nsnugglebugg.com/sagepixie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244317154,"authorName":"swissarmy_wife","from":"&quot;swissarmy_wife&quot; &lt;heatherbean@...&gt;","profile":"swissarmy_wife","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Forcing a &quot;please&quot; or an &quot;ask nicely&quot;","postDate":"1238708257","msgId":39255,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyM2I3MSsyN2psQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdxdTg1bStjbG41QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39254,"nextInTopic":39256,"prevInTime":39254,"nextInTime":39256,"topicId":39217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The dr. said for her to say the magic word.

But because they deserve the same respect and<br/>\ndignity as adults.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would be making an informed decision. You are completely aware of the inherent social contract in the community you live in. You can also discern when a &quot;Please&quot; is appropriate or not and when someone is aggressively manipulating you. Again force and withholding two different things.

They are given a grace period that an adult has already passed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our major disagreement isn&#39;t in the Childs behavior but in the Doctors. I see his request for her to say please as gentle reminder, a courtesy, teaching her that there is a way to phrase her desires that will garner the help she wants in reaching her goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see it as overly manipulative and rude. As nether of us was actually there it&#39;s impossible to say who&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children tell me; &quot;I want ice cream.&quot; I say &quot;Great! Thanks for telling me&quot; IF there&#39;s ice cream in the freezer they are welcome to it. If there&#39;s not or they need help, they come back to me and ASK &quot;Can you help me get ice cream?&quot; <br/>\nA statement of want is not the same as a request for help. <br/>\nIF my children say &quot;Get me ice cream.&quot; or in Oobie speak &quot;ICE CREAM &lt;point point&gt;&quot; I say &quot;I&#39;m not going to help you when you speak to me like that.

They are manipulating me into handing them ice cream and I am manipulating them into speaking to me in a way fitting of a person they love and respect. I speak to them with exactly the same love and respect. Kids do what works.

Others are happy to provide or help by a sincere request even w/o a &quot;please.&quot;  Before the next appointment go over that again and explain to your daughter that her dr requires a &quot;please&quot; to get a sticker.

We&#39;ve done this plenty of times in similar situations, and it&#39;s hard for the offerer to refute. When we do this, I don&#39;t see it as an attempt to convince or influence the doctor/teacher/cashier/whatever about the validity of my belief system, but as a simple statement of our beliefs. I should be able to tell someone &quot;I don&#39;t eat meat&quot; without getting into an argument about the benefits of being a vegetarian. <br/>\n <br/>\nPersonally, I wouldn&#39;t want to model &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; unless I was authentically thankful about something; otherwise, it seems a bit manipulative, I think.

He also has no wait, is nearby (living out in the country this is impt.), and gives you all the time you need (really). However, today after about 20 minutes or more of eye tests (covering eyes, reading letters, etc.) my dd said she wanted a sticker (as is the normal ending of every visit). The dr. said for her to say the magic word. I told him that we didn&#39;t believe in a magic word, but that we modeled ways to ask and that that was it. He persisted and wouldn&#39;t give her a sticker unless she asked &quot;nicely.&quot; This went back and forth several times (I&#39;m talking several minutes) until he finally gave me a sticker for asking nicely. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis dr. has too many positives to get rid of him, but he wasn&#39;t respectful of dd.

We&#39;ve been going to this dr. since my first child was 7 days old.  We really like him and his attitude.  He&#39;s very gentle and open-minded about most things (such as vaccines and such).  He also has no wait, is nearby (living out in the country this is impt.), and gives you all the time you need (really).  However, today after about 20 minutes or more of eye tests (covering eyes, reading letters, etc.) my dd said she wanted a sticker (as is the normal ending of every visit).  The dr. said for her to say the magic word.  I told him that we didn&#39;t believe in a magic word, but that we modeled ways to ask and that that was it.  He persisted and wouldn&#39;t give her a sticker unless she asked &quot;nicely.&quot;  This went back and forth several times (I&#39;m talking several minutes) until he finally gave me a sticker for asking nicely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis dr. has too many positives to get rid of him, but he wasn&#39;t respectful of dd.  Any ideas on how to deal with this issue in the future (it&#39;s happened before, it just really persisted for too long).  I tried to explain our philosophy, but didn&#39;t do the best job of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39235,"nextTopicId":39259}}
