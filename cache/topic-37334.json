Because &quot;school&quot; transcends physical boundaries in Alberta, school here can mean online and correspondance also which are two areas that some people think are <br/>\n&quot;homeschooling&quot; but are not. When I, other parents and the government admin types use the word, school, we mean it to be &quot;teacher directed&quot; which means the teacher does the planning, delivering and marking. In Alberta, many students do not attend a school but are certainly not self-directed. So, even unschooling doesn&#39;t fit. &quot;Learner directed&quot; means the learner decides the plan, self delivers or acquires the knowledge and evaluates their progress.  I rather like those terms better then &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot; because they are more clearer on who is in the drivers seat.  Even though they attend a school, my kids are clearly in the drivers seat of their education plan, but I can understand how confusing this can all be to people!<br/>\nWarm wishes,<br/>\nJudy<br/>\nJudy Arnall,  Peaceful Parenting, Family and Relationship Expert, Speaker (Professional Member of CAPS) and Author of &quot;Discipline Without Distress: 135 tools for raising caring, responsible children without time-out, spanking, punishment or bribery&quot;  www.professionalparenting.ca   Tele: (403) 714-6766 Email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>  &quot;Peace In The World Begins In The Home&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Ren Allen <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 16, 2008 10:16 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Giving up on unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Professional Parenting&quot;<br/>\n  &lt;jarnall@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &quot;When the kids want to try a school.&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m not sure about that.

I realized<br/>\nthe most important THING I could give my kids is ME, and my unconditional<br/>\nsupport for what they want.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Yeah, I really need to do this. Sitting around feeling sorry for myself<br/>\n(ok so I am not actually sitting around but metaphorically) isn&#39;t in anyway<br/>\nmeeting my children&#39;s needs. In fact it is stealing so much of my energy<br/>\nthat I could be spending time having fun with them. I don&#39;t HAVE TO feel<br/>\ncrappy. I don&#39;t have money, it just is. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s all a journey, and I&#39;m not perfect by any means (hey, Kelly!), but my<br/>\nkids KNOW I&#39;m here for them. When I was a child, I stopped asking for what I<br/>\nwanted, because we never had the money. I stopped dreaming. I saw my mom<br/>\nspending over $100 a month on cigarettes, but we had to fight to get her to<br/>\nbuy our school yearbooks. She used money as an excuse, but really, it was<br/>\nher unwillingness to support us that<br/>\n&quot;broke&quot; us, her unhealed childhood.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I cried when I read this. This was a part of my dysfunctional childhood<br/>\nas well. I don&#39;t want to pack this in bags for my kids. I guess I am needing<br/>\nto unpack and let go of some heavy stuff (fun, fun, fun). I *KNOW* that I<br/>\ndon&#39;t do this to my kids. I don&#39;t want to do anything else as a reaction to<br/>\nhaving gone through that as a child.  I don&#39;t want to feel like I don&#39;t<br/>\ndeserve things anymore. I want my kids to know that their needs are<br/>\nimportant, I think that they do. We have a vision board and regularly find<br/>\nways to meet needs. It can be tricky but they feel taken seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;I had to stop believing I was broke, and I started really appreciating what<br/>\nwe DO have.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***This is a huge struggle for me. I don&#39;t mind being poor. Really I don&#39;t.<br/>\nIt is the debt that gets me. It is not having enough  to cover necessities.<br/>\nIt freaks me out. I do try (and am most successful) at focusing on what we<br/>\nhave and being grateful for that. My kids will occasionally remind me.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;I can&#39;t get into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place<br/>\nfor a bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have<br/>\navailable&quot; board?&quot;<br/>\n***That is an awesome idea. I have been wanting my dh (a graphic<br/>\ndesigner/web guy) to make me a site for that. A kind of paperback swap for<br/>\npassions site. We hve too much on our plate right now so it hasn&#39;t happened.<br/>\nBut perhaps it could in the near future.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;As many of you know, I don&#39;t buy into the popular &quot;Law of Attraction.&quot; But<br/>\nI *do* believe that, if you put your needs &quot;out there,&quot; your needs will more<br/>\nlikely be met. Not letting others know what you need won&#39;t get you anything<br/>\nany sooner!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am glad you said this Kelly (and Ren). I hear this frequently and it<br/>\nstresses me. I am a positive upbeat optimistic person. One would think I<br/>\nwould attract more of the same�I feel like a failure when some one asserts<br/>\nthat I just need to think positively and my life will be swell.<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;Also, I think there&#39;s a big difference between stopping unschooling and<br/>\n&#39;giving up&#39; on unschooling - &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Great point. I can&#39;t imagine &quot;Giving up&quot; as I can&#39;t imagine living life<br/>\nin a different way then we do.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;Check out the free local newspapers near the entrance to the grocery store<br/>\n&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Here is one of my biggest dilemmas. I live in a rural town. Population<br/>\n500. We have a post office, dance studio (fundamental christian), a tavern,<br/>\na nursery and an over-priced deli (it serves the rail-trail clientele). Oh<br/>\nand two churches. We are atheist/agnostic.  We do not even have a community<br/>\nplayground, though the church seems ok with the kids playing there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a small city (York PA) about 20 minutes drive, we frequently drive<br/>\nto do things there. We live about an hour from Baltimore, MD, Lancaster, PA<br/>\nand Harrisburg, PA. Which is great when we have money. We can find loads to<br/>\ndo in these cities, there are a variety of museums, shops, classes, etc. We<br/>\nfrequently do not have money to drive to any of those. Although we do have a<br/>\nzoo pass and went there one day even though it was 40 degrees J It was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many times free stuff actually costs money in gas we don&#39;t have. That is<br/>\nwhen I really feel crappy. My kids are cool with not getting new stuff, they<br/>\nstart to miss the experience stuff, kwim? They want to go to the science<br/>\ncenter but it is $6 in gas that we don&#39;t have. That is my problem with<br/>\nfreecycle and Craig list. I typically can&#39;t drive to get stuff. Although I<br/>\nam careful to try to combine trips (like pick up a gift when I go to the<br/>\ngrocery).<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------------------------<br/>\n&quot;Where do you live? Is there an unschooling group in your area? Or a<br/>\nhomeschooling group? &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I love in South Central PA, 50 miles north of Baltimore MD. I have<br/>\nstarted an unschoolers at our home. It really hasn&#39;t caught on yet so any<br/>\nsuggestions on how to make it successful would be great.  The other group is<br/>\nchristian school-at-homers (you have to sign a statement of faith), so we<br/>\ndon&#39;t do activities with them. We have a couple families we are friends with<br/>\n,one is on this group and the other is not an unschooling family.<br/>\nI know a lot of people say &quot;go make friends&quot;, HOW? I have no idea. I am not<br/>\ngood at it. And it seems like most people don&#39;t like me and my family. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t mean they don&#39;t like us and all just that we don&#39;t click, does that<br/>\nmake sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing this for myself, to help clarify. We go to youth combat through<br/>\nSCA twice a month (free). Dd12 has a monthly reading club at the library<br/>\n(free). Dd12 has a daytime theater troupe that meets sporadically (free) she<br/>\nwants more so she is going to more auditions (free or nominal odds and<br/>\nends), dd12 is training for a triathlon (not free-needs several things to be<br/>\nable to train further and compete). We have the weekly RU hangout at our<br/>\nhouse,  � weeks at least one family shows up. Ds6 has WOW, that he plays<br/>\nfrequently. Ds12 volunteers at a cat rescue weekly (last week she got to<br/>\nhelp with some vet tech work), there are occasional free activities my kids<br/>\nare interested in at the state park nearby,  we also have a zoo pass (zoo is<br/>\n50 miles away). We have very infrequently playdates with our one non-ru<br/>\nfriends. My kids sometimes play with the neighborhood  kids but notice a<br/>\ndifference they don&#39;t enjoy now that they are back in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if this is enough. But perhaps it has to be since this *IS*<br/>\nwhat we can do right now. I would LOVE suggestions on other options. Many<br/>\nwon&#39;t work now but could in the near future, when we have at least a little<br/>\nbit of money to work with. In writing, I see that this is more than<br/>\nadequate. Definitely better than school, especially because my kids don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to go. Except dd12 wants to go to a free school 50 miles away that<br/>\ncost, even with scholarship 200 a month! I ask her that if we had 200 a<br/>\nmonth extra would she rather spend that one fun stuff she wants to do like<br/>\nkarate lessons, etc or go to school. She said fun stuff. So I take that to<br/>\nmean she is happier at home except for the money issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":192566012,"authorName":"balickgoodmanfamily","from":"&quot;balickgoodmanfamily&quot; &lt;catonsvillenanny@...&gt;","profile":"balickgoodmanfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Giving up on unschooling","postDate":"1229449014","msgId":37362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdpOG92bStsMHRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQjJEOUJCNEVGNTRBMi0yRjQtNjdFQE1CTEstTTI5LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37361,"nextInTopic":37366,"prevInTime":37361,"nextInTime":37363,"topicId":37334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Kelly, ... as possible?  Most of our family joy comes from being together and discovering new things.

When the family being<br/>\ntogether is unhealthy is probably the top of the list. If it&#39;s an<br/>\nabusive situation or a neglectful situation, then definitely school<br/>\nwould probably be better for the kids than being home in an unsafe<br/>\nsituation. School would be a better option if the kids are ignored and<br/>\nleft to fend for themselves 24/7 while mom and dad &quot;do their own thing&quot;<br/>\nwhatever that may be (whether it&#39;s drugs or an all-consuming career). <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is not a key factor necessarily - it&#39;s possible to unschool with<br/>\nlittle money, it&#39;s possible to unschool with both parents working, it&#39;s<br/>\npossible to unschool as a single parent, it&#39;s possible to unschool with<br/>\nongoing health issues in the family. BUT it does require being flexible<br/>\n- it might mean mom and dad work opposite shifts for a time to bring in<br/>\nenough income; it might mean recruiting a family member or friend to be<br/>\navailable to supervise/assist/transport the kid(s) while mom/dad work;<br/>\nit might mean taking longer to get out of debt (or getting further into<br/>\ndebt for a time) and postponing a lot of other plans (vacations,<br/>\nvehicles, bigger house, etc); it might mean looking for unique income<br/>\nopportunities - like right now, I work fulltime and DH is home with DS,<br/>\nbut his interest in creating unique items out of duct tape is starting<br/>\nto actually get close to breaking even - this is the first year so there<br/>\nwere some start up costs plus we were still just finding our way to<br/>\nthings like craft fairs, we&#39;re looking to actually make more than we<br/>\nspend in 2009. It&#39;s not a ton of money but it helps with random stuff<br/>\nlike the occasional movie at the theater. Note that the interest came<br/>\nfirst, then we had to figure out what to do with the stuff that was<br/>\naccumulating in the spare room lol. It&#39;s also been cool because we&#39;ve<br/>\nbartered with other crafters for items and/or worked out discounts so<br/>\nthat we got much of our holiday shopping done for free or for less than<br/>\nit would cost to do commercial shopping. (SHAMELESS PLUG:<br/>\nwww.creativeductapestry.etsy.com There&#39;s still time if you order by Dec<br/>\n18 for things to get there by Christmas Eve if it ships by priority<br/>\nmail). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I think there&#39;s a big difference between stopping unschooling and<br/>\n&#39;giving up&#39; on unschooling - you might not be unschooling technically<br/>\nwith the kids in school or doing school at home BUT it&#39;s a change of<br/>\ndirection, not giving up on it. That&#39;s different. Giving up on it is<br/>\nsaying that it can&#39;t work, won&#39;t work, is an impossibility. That&#39;s<br/>\ndifferent than saying Right now, for this time, we&#39;re changing direction<br/>\ndue to choice/circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo make the world rich doesn&#39;t take a lot of money - freecycle,<br/>\nlibraries (which often have music, art, movies, and other things that<br/>\ncan be explored), etc  -but it does take time and effort. For instance,<br/>\nmany museums have a &#39;free admission&#39; day on a regular basis. Many<br/>\nlibraries (at least up here) have free or discount passes to local<br/>\n&quot;attractions&quot; (children&#39;s museum, aquarium, zoo, etc). Stepping out of<br/>\none&#39;s comfort zone and seeking out other homeschoolers as well - you can<br/>\nget a group together and explore each other&#39;s interests... If I were<br/>\ndown south a bit, I might go visit Kelly and see her bees and talk about<br/>\ndogs. We&#39;ve talked about DS maybe spending a summer working with a<br/>\nfriend of ours building decks (once DS is old enough, if he so chooses).<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;d want to spend time with BIL learning about stuff (BIL is a<br/>\ncertified mechanic who also did about 85% of the construction work on<br/>\nhis house, they totally gutted it and rearranged rooms and everything,<br/>\nand he&#39;s now on storm duty as a lineman with an electric company). A<br/>\nfriend of ours is a sculptress so maybe he&#39;d want to spend time with<br/>\nher. Other friends are musicians. All that is pretty much free access to<br/>\na whole wide world of things. And that doesn&#39;t include the Internet and<br/>\nother media sources (and I&#39;m guessing she has Internet access since<br/>\nshe&#39;s probably emailing these questions). Check out the free local<br/>\nnewspapers near the entrance to the grocery store - they usually have<br/>\nfree events for families listed. BUT as the OP says, since she has no<br/>\n&quot;local&quot; friends, it&#39;s going to take some stepping out of her comfort<br/>\nzone to find the resources, the people, the connections.

Not letting others know what you need won&#39;t get you anything any sooner!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Rossing mentioned that she wants a keyboard. She wasn&#39;t &quot;fishing&quot; for one. She just mentioned it in passing on a list. I know we have one somewhere in our house. (I still haven&#39;t found it, Deb. I&#39;ll have Cameron look when he gets back!) But there&#39;s a real possibility that Deb will have one in the next few weeks---just because &quot;someone&quot; heard she wanted one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are always people out there who love you. Ask them. What will it cost you but humility? Years ago, we were in the midst of what&#39;s known here as &quot;The Big Suck.&quot; I&#39;ll spare you all the nasty details, but we were broke. New baby, Ben was making NO money (in fact, Duncan&#39;s conception was due to celebrating a long-overdue paycheck &lt;g&gt;), I was clinically depressed but refusing meds, and I was working full-time trying just to feed us and keep the electricity on. I humbled myself and asked a client for money. She didn&#39;t blink an eye as she sat down and wrote out a <br/>\n$6,000.00 check. (Who the F*** has $6,000.00 in CHECKING???) It saved my business, and we kept our house. We had to declare bankruptcy eventually anyway, but it got us through another year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my father we had nothing for the boys for Christmas a couple of years after that: it was the kids&#39; best Christmas ever: a trampoline for Duncan and a drum set for Cameron. Daddy helped a lot during that time---he even paid our mortgage a couple of times. On the other hand, when we went to *Ben&#39;s* father for help during The Big Suck, he told Ben to suck it up and get a job, and he wouldn&#39;t give us a penny. But that very much clarified our relationships with our fathers. Since then, we&#39;ve sent my parents to NY for a weekend and sent my dad and Cameron to Scotland for ten days. (What goes around, comes around. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also often asked for memberships to zoos and museums here. Season passes to things like the philharmonic, the town theatre, or the ballet. That way the gift can *give* for a whole year. And it always feels as if there&#39;s something to do that&#39;s &quot;free.&quot; Plus, for unschoolers, it makes the grandparents think that they are helping with their grandchildren&#39;s meager education. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs goofy as it sounds, volunteering is a great way to help yourself. You meet some really neat people. You get to see that you&#39;re wealthy in so many ways when you see others with even less than you have. And you might even be on the receiving end if you let the orga<br/>\nnization know. We&#39;ve worked with a nursing home and a food bank, we&#39;ve adopted several families through Families Helping Families, and we&#39;ve raised two guide dogs. In the end, we received waaaay more than we gave. Seriously---consider volunteering at the local soup kitchen or for Toys for Tots. It&#39;s an outlay of time, not money. (And usually---well, in my case, anyway--- when you have one, you don&#39;t have the other. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd regarding making their worlds as rich as possible: Do you know the difference between rich and wealthy? Rich means you have money. Wealthy means you have time. Make the most of what you *have*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends don&#39;t have to be local. My best friends live far away. We use the US Postal Service. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lent my saddles to teens who couldn&#39;t afford to buy them. I keep thinking that I&#39;ll want to ride again, so I&#39;m not comfortable giving them away or selling them, but I tell them that they can have them on semi-permanent loan. &lt;G&gt; Both have eventually been returned when the girls have changed interests or saved up enough to buy a saddle they wanted---and always in perfect condition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child were to want a.......keyboard, for example &lt;G&gt;, put the word out there. Someone you know has one gathering dust somewhere. Unschoolers have GREAT resources available to us now! I can&#39;t get into that RUN.NING thang, but THAT would be a FANTASTIC place for a bulletin board, of sorts. Ren? Laura? An &quot;I need&quot; and an &quot;I have available&quot; board? Where folks could p<br/>\nost what they need for their children?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids outgrow and lose interest in things all the time. And there&#39;s always a child who would LOVE a used &quot;whatever.&quot; Deb Lewis&#39; son, Dylan, sent Duncan a huge box full of Bionicles he&#39;d out grown a year or so ago. In their original boxes, no less! Duncan was thrilled! I sent Ren&#39;s son, Jalen, a box of Spiderman stuff that Duncan outgrew because we knew Jalen loved Spiderman. I have a box FULL of R.L. Stine&#39;s Goosebump books that&#39;s just taking up space. Anybody looking for spooky books? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople LOVE to share their passions. I LOVE talking to horse-crazed girls, veterinarian/groomer wannabees, dog show groupies, and unschoolers! I love being with beekeepers and gardeners. I&#39;m happy to share my knowledge AND my equipment with someone who will get as much enjoyment out of it as I do. I&#39;m not alone! &lt;g&gt; I think that&#39;s true of *most* people! We like to see eyes light up at a new discovery or ability! Ask folks with the same passions as your children for help. I know that most show dog breeders readily give *very* nice dogs to junior handlers because they know that pup will be well cared for and that that child will work HARD to make that dog a champion. $1,000 dogs! Free! Because they know it can be an expensive hobby for a child---and because maybe *they* had mentors who helped them get started in the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron has spent hours and hours with some of the top magicians in the world working on sleights. He&#39;s20had lessons from some of the biggest names in skateboarding. He&#39;s sat and jammed with some BIG names in music. He&#39;s worked with famous actors in films. Simply because they ALL love what they do and want to share.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoney shouldn&#39;t stand in the way of passion. I know that it *can*---especially if we&#39;re not willing to take chances and ask for help. But it doesn&#39;t HAVE to! Passion-sharers love to find each other!

There has been a lot of talk on  <br/>\nthe list lately about wish lists and opening things up to the universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery museum in our city has free days, at some point in the year, we  <br/>\nassiduously record those days and attend. I offer volunteer work at  <br/>\nsome places to get free entry. We might go without McD&#39;s for a few  <br/>\nweeks, to save up money to go someplace. The kids gave up sodas for  <br/>\nnearly two months to save up gas money to go to Kansas City. We never  <br/>\nonce said, &#39;this is how we&#39;ll save money&#39;, what we said was &#39;how can  <br/>\nwe get $x for gas money, $y for a hotel room, and $z to get into the  <br/>\nmuseum?&#39; Of course, they are completely involved in our budgeting, so  <br/>\nthey know how much we spend on soda, on snacks, etc. Sodas are less  <br/>\nthan 50¢ each, but it adds up quickly. Box of cookies, even the  <br/>\ndollar ones, cost a lot more than making them, and cooking with kids  <br/>\nis another way to enrich their world. And build relationships, as  <br/>\nwell as trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s always freecycle, craigslist, the salvation army store  <br/>\n(our favorite, all kinds of hidden treasures). Flea markets. Yard  <br/>\nsales. Library book sales (the last day at our public library is an  <br/>\nentire box for $5) The internet opens up an entire world, and we can  <br/>\nmake things ourselves with what is available, or with cheaper  <br/>\ncomponents. We got a case of test tubes from a coworker just by  <br/>\nmentioning that Emily was looking for some, her spouse works in a  <br/>\nresearch facility. Make some new friends. Get on mothering.com and  <br/>\nfind your tribe, find people on THIS list who live in your area, or  <br/>\nhave family in your area. Open your home to traveling unschoolers (we  <br/>\ndid that and had such a wonderful time!!! Went to the free day at the  <br/>\nscience museum, learned so much about what THEY knew and got some  <br/>\ngreat ideas)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe possibilities are endless, if you let yourself believe that they  <br/>\nare.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 16, 2008, at 7:45 AM, Kelly Lovejoy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From the anonymous OP:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **************<br/>\n&gt; What can someone who is broke do to make their child&#39;s world as  <br/>\n&gt; rich as possible?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also, we have two supportive relatives.

Tons of books and movies, and if they don&#39;t have the one we<br/>\nwant, we use inter-library loan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got museum memberships for my birthday. For my birthday and<br/>\nChristmas presents, I ask for gift certificates to get things for the<br/>\nboys - Target, Amazon.com, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get on FreeCycle and ask for things, and catch things the boys might<br/>\nwant. We don&#39;t always get what we want, but Seth got over 200 Yu-Gi-Oh<br/>\ncards that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have done a LOT of work to change my thinking about money and<br/>\nspending. Reading &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; by Dominguez and Robins<br/>\nopened my eyes in a LOT of ways. I felt a little ashamed at Kelly&#39;s<br/>\nprevious post - the person buying organic coffee but not having enough<br/>\nfor the kids&#39; wants was me, years ago. I read that book, which points<br/>\nout that what you spend on shows what you value - and it showed, for<br/>\none month, that I valued Starbucks and magazines over the boys&#39;<br/>\neducation. Never again!! Once I SAW that, I saw it. It makes my<br/>\nstomach knot up when I think of it - but I was in that &quot;But it&#39;s<br/>\nMYYYYY turn!&quot; mode, and I didn&#39;t even see it &#39;til I wrote it all down.<br/>\nThis was when I was married, and we were fairly secure financially.<br/>\n<br/>\nI accept what is. I stopped fighting reality. I stopped thinking we<br/>\n*should* have more. I began taking responsibility - that was new! And<br/>\nthat&#39;s just in the past couple of years, I&#39;m still learning about<br/>\nthat. I realized the most important THING I could give my kids is ME,<br/>\nand my unconditional support for what they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to stop believing I was broke, and I started really appreciating<br/>\nwhat we DO have. We have an abundant, abundant life, with not much<br/>\nmoney. The time to daydream is abundance. The time to create with no<br/>\nbell telling you to change subjects is abundance. The time we spend<br/>\ncuddled up watching TV, with no need to go to bed by a certain time is<br/>\nabundance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all a journey, and I&#39;m not perfect by any means (hey, Kelly!),<br/>\nbut my kids KNOW I&#39;m here for them. When I was a child, I stopped<br/>\nasking for what I wanted, because we never had the money. I stopped<br/>\ndreaming.

In ten years of homeschooling at least three of my children have floated in and out of various schools for a few months at a time to see what its like.  They were entirely their choices, not mine. My two sons chose to go to high school this year and I still consider us unschoolers.  We learn what we are interested in at home and they are taking the courses that interest them and are offered in a school building.  Beleive me, there are no courses in metal technology for teens in our city other then in a school.  They are free to quit whenever they wish and I will support them and actually, one son is quitting after Christmas.  We are still learner centred in our beleifs and I consider us still unschoolers.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy Arnall,  Peaceful Parenting, Family and Relationship Expert, Speaker (Professional Member of CAPS) and Author of &quot;Discipline Without Distress: 135 tools for raising caring, responsible children without time-out, spanking, punishment or bribery&quot;  www.professionalparenting.ca   Tele: (403) 714-6766 Email <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jarnall@...\">jarnall@...</a>  &quot;Peace In The World Begins In The Home&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Joyce Fetteroll <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 16, 2008 3:29 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Giving up on unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Dec 15, 2008, at 4:55 PM, Kelly Lovejoy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; Do you have any thoughts on when a family should give up on <br/>\n  &gt; unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the parents aren&#39;t willing to put in the time to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the kids want to try school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When the parents want something different than what unschooling offers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; When would school be a better option than staying home?<br/>\n<br/>\n  When kids need a safe place to be during the day and home isn&#39;t. <br/>\n  (Though primary focus should be the situation at home.

If you can&#39;t figure <br/>\nout how to live with your kids day in and day out without trying to <br/>\ncontrol their behavior, unschooling probably won&#39;t work very well for <br/>\nyou. That sounds snarky, but supporting our kids without &quot;managing&quot; <br/>\nthem is one of the harder parts of unschooling for many many parents - <br/>\nit runs counter to what most of us once thought of as &quot;good parenting&quot;. <br/>\nAnyway, that&#39;s not to say that *homeschooling* won&#39;t work - a good <br/>\nfriend of mine manages her own controlling behavior by confining it <br/>\nto &quot;homeschool time&quot;. The rest of the time she&#39;s a fairly easygoing <br/>\nparent. Then again, I know another mom who dropped homeschooling and <br/>\nput her kids in school because she was so much more controlling as a <br/>\nhomeschooler it was ruining her relationship with the kids. With the <br/>\nkids in school, she&#39;s less controlling when they&#39;re home. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore Ray moved in with us, I kind of assumed that in dire financial <br/>\nstraights I could always send Mo to school for a little while - a <br/>\nmonth, a year, whatever it took to find another option. But since Ray <br/>\nwas (according to the school principal) on the &quot;prison track&quot; its not <br/>\nreally an option to send *him* back to school. So when George got hurt, <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t even consider it. We begged money from friends and family for <br/>\na couple months until I landed a job. Its not exactly a high-paying <br/>\njob, but we&#39;ve been able to squeek by. We certainly don&#39;t have the <br/>\nbiggest, richest life we possibly could, but if the kids were in school <br/>\nthey&#39;re lives would be even smaller. If ever I&#39;m not sure of that, I <br/>\nask Ray.
