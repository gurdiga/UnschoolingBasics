I have been basically co-sleeping with my two rugrats since I became single again and we all need and love it.  My two boys are 1 and 4.  We kind of have the same ritual every night --- we all crawl in to bed -- baby gets his bottle and slumps off to sleep or bounces on our heads for a while then settles down and the older one always watches a couple movies.  This way I get my cuddle time with them yet I can fall asleep before his movies if I want to and I can know he is &#39;safe&#39; .    I don&#39;t know why co-sleeping has become so taboo in our cultural.  at one time in our history most families only had one bed (and probably only one room) so everyone had to sleep together.  I know that our cultural has grown be have almost become distant from our own family.   I always try to just tell myself that if it feels right and comfortable for me and my children than it is right.        <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nearthmomma31 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:earthmomma@...\">earthmomma@...</a>&gt; wrote:           --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Johanna &lt;dialog@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Dear List,I&#39;m looking for cultural information about co-sleeping. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTine Thevenin author of The Family Bed has a good portion of her book <br/>\ndedicated to co-sleeping bedsharing history.

It has been something our small <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  family has believed in, and so has felt very natural that we do it. We  <br/>\n&gt; have one child, who feels secure and safe in the same room or bed  <br/>\n&gt; sleeping with one or both parents, even though he knows we leave the  <br/>\n&gt; room for a bit at times. How long has this desire for cosleeping  <br/>\n&gt; continued in other families? I know it probably varies for every  <br/>\n&gt; child, but I am curious....and admittedly selfishly looking towards  <br/>\n&gt; more night-time  freedom.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>My sons are 12 and 9 and we still co sleep in our King size bed.  We  all are <br/>\nvery comforted by co sleeping.  It just feels like it is how it  should be.  <br/>\nMy boys do have their own room, with their toys etc.  But  for now they prefer <br/>\nto sleep along side us.  I am sure when they are ready  they will want their <br/>\nown beds but for now this is our family bed.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23847,"nextTopicId":23849}}
