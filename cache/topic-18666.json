This is the child you raised.  Same person that she was before these issues cropped up.  She&#39;s a tween. Puberty is knocking at the door.  Is she staying in this rotten mood as long as this thread?  If she is, I&#39;d try to find out what happened.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn our house, we have affectionately named the oldest daughter &#39;the bear&#39;.  For a period of time, we kept telling the youngest to stop poking the bear.  He would try everything to get her attention whether it be positive or negative attention didn&#39;t matter.  Then she would retaliate hence the saying.  <br/>\nI&#39;m new to calling what we do &#39;unschooling&#39; but that&#39;s the beauty of unschooling.  You can try to talk it through with her or you can just give her her space.  You have the right to tell her, if she wants to be ugly she can do it alone in her room or out in the yard.  You don&#39;t have to let her issues become your issues.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe ladies here have given you incredible advise.  If you can&#39;t talk to her. you could try a nicely worded note, telling her that you love her and are there if she needs you.  Cranky shouldn&#39;t last forever and I&#39;d hate for my daughters to not be able to confide in me.   Sometimes just leaving them alone while reassuring them that you are there if they need you is all that they need.  Always be ready to embrace them when they come to you.  Hugs go a long way.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, October 30, 2006 12:22:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: unfriendly daughter, the second<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 29, 2006, at 7:06 PM, Johanna wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I guess I want to be able to control my feelings and that she&#39;s able<br/>\n&gt; to control her feelings, but at the same time grant us the right to<br/>\n&gt; be &quot;authentic&quot;.

Maybe it&#39;s a case of her taking <br/>\nher pent up school frustrations out in safety, at home.   Sometimes adults <br/>\ntake their frustration out on those closest to them because they feel secure <br/>\ndoing that.  They know the people who love them will forgive them.   She <br/>\nneeds home to be a safe harbor, so as hard as it may be, try not to get <br/>\nangry with her.  Try to comfort her and give her more reasons to think of <br/>\nhome as her nest.<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago Sandra Dodd wrote something I wish I had saved in a more secure <br/>\nplace than just my mind. &lt;G&gt;   She said if you give kids a bunch of meanness <br/>\nthey will redistribute it to those around them.   Maybe school leaves her <br/>\nfeeling full of meanness.   Give her a bunch of love to displace the <br/>\nmeanness.  Don&#39;t add more meanness by getting cranky or impatient.<br/>\n<br/>\n***if I let her &quot;get away with it&quot;. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nTry not to think of her as someone who&#39;s trying to manipulate you.   She&#39;s a <br/>\nlittle girl who&#39;s doing the best she can to get her needs met and navigate <br/>\nher world.   She needs your help and you will help her in better ways if you <br/>\nalways think well of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember, people don&#39;t learn a whole new way of *being* overnight.  It <br/>\nwill take time for her to learn better ways to deal with problems and nicer <br/>\nways to talk with people when she&#39;s grumpy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285320662,"authorName":"Johanna","from":"Johanna &lt;dialog@...&gt;","profile":"solelokua","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unfriendly daughter, the second","postDate":"1162168997","msgId":18671,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzQkVBMTEwLTdDRjctNDNGRS05MUQ2LTlFMUJBMTMxNzFEMEB1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExOS1EQVYzMDRCODRENkZBMTBCQjM1OEM5MjVEM0ZCMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PEVBRTMyMzdDLTgwMjAtNDdGMi04NEYzLTMyNjAwRTA2M0MxOEB1bmVyem9nZW4uZGU+IDxCQVkxMTktREFWMzA0Qjg0RDZGQTEwQkIzNThDOTI1RDNGQjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":18670,"nextInTopic":18672,"prevInTime":18670,"nextInTime":18672,"topicId":18666,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Lisa, ...

While talking to my father, he pointed out that I couldn&#39;t tell  <br/>\nall people in the world who interact with her that we are parenting  <br/>\ndifferently and that they should treat her more respectfully and that  <br/>\nshe might have problems at school with that. He may be right. I hope  <br/>\nshe just learns that there are certain rules that belong in school  <br/>\n(for the time being). It could be though that she starts hating  <br/>\nschool and I&#39;m very afraid that happens, for lack of alternatives.  <br/>\nThe Sudbury School (I&#39;m &quot;lucky&quot; because there are only 3 in Germany  <br/>\nand one of them is starting off here in my city) hasn&#39;t really  <br/>\nstarted out here yet and I&#39;m not sure if I want to send her there.  <br/>\nThe other alternative schools don&#39;t have places left. I can talk to  <br/>\nthe teacher...<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you mean I should try to find out how she would like to be  <br/>\ntreated when she is like this? It&#39;s very hard to tell...

I don&#39;t know what to do NOW) and then I can&#39;t just react  <br/>\nfiendly. I want to model friendliness. But I can&#39;t just react  <br/>\nfriendly every time she&#39;s sooo unfriendly to me. She&#39;ll whine and  <br/>\norder me to do things in a horrible unfriendly tone. I know this is a  <br/>\nresidue from the past and I know I&#39;m the one who modelled this  <br/>\nbehaviour before. I&#39;ve tried to stay calm and just inform her that  <br/>\nnext time, I&#39;d like her to say it nicer. I&#39;ve tried to say &quot;I won&#39;t  <br/>\nlet anybody talk to me that way&quot; when it&#39;s really just too much. But  <br/>\nbeyond that I don&#39;t know what to do. Also, the result is, that  <br/>\neverytime I overreact or sound the least unfriendly or demanding or  <br/>\nanything, she&#39;ll shout &quot;I won&#39;t let anybody talk to me that way!&quot; ;-)  <br/>\nShe&#39;s right but then no talking is possible, she&#39;ll refuse to talk  <br/>\nand walk away. On the one hand I feel like not doing anything at all  <br/>\nof what she is requesting (demanding) when talked to like that, but  <br/>\nif I do that this is kind of like punishing her (like I did in the  <br/>\npast). On the other hand, I also don&#39;t just want to swallow and just  <br/>\ndo it, because I fear I will model that you can talk like that to  <br/>\neverybody if you want and get what you want.

I don&#39;t know how to react!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we just had a problem again and she was so naggy and demanding  <br/>\nand unfriendly, disrespectful and everything, I still stayed calm but  <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t help but say that I actually wasn&#39;t motivated at all to do  <br/>\nanything because she was so unfriendly... At the end she went off to  <br/>\nher room. She always does that. If there is a problem and she feels  <br/>\nwe don&#39;t understand, she just walks off. It doesn&#39;t help going after  <br/>\nher, she won&#39;t let anybody in. She&#39;s absolutely unwilling to talk  <br/>\nabout it afterwards even a day after! Even if I have calmed down and  <br/>\napologize and so on! So we can actually never just talk about the  <br/>\nreal problem or anything... *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boyfriend suggested that the priority now was to build up that  <br/>\ntrust that I&#39;m her partner and helper, so I should swallow first and  <br/>\njust do whatever she wants no matter what she requests and how. When  <br/>\nthat trust is built up, everything would be different and if the  <br/>\nproblem persisted, one could still approach this problem differently  <br/>\non the basis of trust. It makes sense to me. Is he right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I do with my anger? How could I tell her that I&#39;d like her to  <br/>\nbe friendlier without disrespecting her? How can I swallow without  <br/>\nloosing my dignity? Are you confident she won&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; that she can  <br/>\nbe as unfriendly as she ‘chooses‘ and get everything? Actually since  <br/>\nshe kind of understood that we are trying to live in *freedom*, she  <br/>\nsays all the time everything is her choice. I fear that she doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand that we have freedoms too and one of them has to do with  <br/>\nnot wanting to be talked to like that, wanting to have the &quot;freedom&quot;  <br/>\nto live peacefully and not talked to like a slave...<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like she is in total control of the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nUnerzogen! | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dialog@...\">dialog@...</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unerzogen.de\">http://www.unerzogen.de</a> |  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unerzogen-subscribe@...\">unerzogen-subscribe@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18658,"nextTopicId":18694}}
