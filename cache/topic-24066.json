I will<br/>\nsay something now because I think it&#39;s that important.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a child who used to tell stories. I had no one to really listen and<br/>\nget excited with me about them. My mother found it extremely difficult to<br/>\nsit and listen. She also had to move as I spoke. She walked-away. She said<br/>\nto follow her as she did things around the house. My dad invited me to read<br/>\nmy stories to him when I wrote them. He said he liked them-they helped him<br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I had a different learning style than either parent, but as a child<br/>\nI felt rejected. I think it might be easier for me to communicate now,<br/>\ndecades later, if I felt listened to then. Thanks for reminding me about my<br/>\nimportant role which may not be easy for me to see or do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a parent, I struggle as my parents did. I forget how to stop and listen,<br/>\nand give full respectful attention to my children. I also feel pulled in<br/>\ndifferent directions by my two children. I ask for &quot;mommy days&quot; to be by<br/>\nmyself, or with one child for special attentive &quot;mommy-daughter&quot; time, while<br/>\nthe other child is at a friend&#39;s house or with her dad. This has helped me<br/>\nreplenish and reconnect. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also plan field trips so we can see others successful and passionate about<br/>\nwhat each child is passionate about. Going on field trips has helped me<br/>\nreconnect and regain my daughters&#39; trust-trust that I would honor each<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s passion and respect their values. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Moving from the opposite end of things","postDate":"1180297917","msgId":24086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzY3BydCs4ZDQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzYTljYit0ZGdjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24074,"nextInTopic":24089,"prevInTime":24085,"nextInTime":24087,"topicId":24066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But this hit close to home for me.  I had my ODS Nate when I<br/>\nwas 19 years old.. His Bio-father and I stopped seeing each other when<br/>\nhe was one.. We never lived together..  I lived with my mom and my aunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put myself through school and would have my aunt watch my son during<br/>\nthe day while I was at school.. They became very close and dependent<br/>\non each other. For a lot of reasons.  I can talk to you about them<br/>\nmore one on one because it can get very lengthy.  When I finished<br/>\nschool I went to work and my mom would watch him at night while I<br/>\nworked over night.  Nate was very sick.  He has an immature system. <br/>\n(a lot of stuff that didnt work right).  So he became very close and<br/>\ndependent on my mom and my aunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell when my husband and I moved in together and Nate came with me (of<br/>\ncourse) he did not handle it well at all.. He claimed to HATE!!!! me<br/>\nand HATE!!!!!!!! Kheled.  I mean it was very stressful on us as a<br/>\nfamily.. I never gave in and allowed him to live with my mom.  I<br/>\nwanted him to be with us.. It took a long time and attention but we<br/>\nare a close knit family now.  I showed him that we loved him and would<br/>\nbe there for him through all his pain and scary times.. All his happy<br/>\nand joyful times too.. When he wanted to visit my mom he was allowed to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is some healing that still needs to be done for her..<br/>\nDoes her father make an effort despite her claims of hating him to<br/>\ninteract with her.. Does he tell her that no matter what she says he<br/>\nloves her and will always love her.  That he is never going to leave<br/>\nher.

Doing something over and over sounds pretty passionate to me. <br/>\nThis:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; loves to tell endless stories about<br/>\n&gt; ponies and magical creatures and cats and....  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...makes me think she&#39;s getting a whole lot out of those movies and <br/>\ngames and trying to share it with you. Its not that *she* has no <br/>\nlove of learning - or that she&#39;s necessarily lacking the tools she <br/>\nneeds to learn what she wants. With one big exception:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I have<br/>\n&gt; difficulty understanding things I hear.  She has an unusual tempo <br/>\n </span></blockquote>of speech,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cannot speak while standing still, and loves to tell endless <br/>\n </span></blockquote>stories about<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ponies and magical creatures and cats and....

And go do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yikes! You walk away from your kid when she&#39;s trying to tell you <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on in her life? When she&#39;s bouncing with enthusiasm? <br/>\nOuch. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She refuses to<br/>\n&gt; write her stories down or type them, I can&#39;t understand what she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>says when<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she&#39;s in her Story Mode, so we are left with no good way to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>communicate.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen anyway. Get a tape recorder and record her while you are <br/>\nlistening (don&#39;t say &quot;tell it to the tape&quot; - keep listening, its <br/>\nimportant!). If you can&#39;t figure out what she&#39;s saying on the tape <br/>\n(and you might, without the visual input to juggle at the same time) <br/>\nsee if someone else you know can understand it well enough to <br/>\ntranscribe it, so you can read it and connect with her that way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s hard to have a deep conversation with her... questions of any <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sort<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; generally confuse her. She has to be in the perfect right mood to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be able<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to converse.  I know that&#39;s rather strange, but... that&#39;s who she <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t sound all that strange to me. She may be verbal but not <br/>\nvery social - so she can talk, can tell stories, maybe even has a <br/>\nbig vocabulary, but can&#39;t necessarily connect with other people <br/>\nverbally in terms of conversation. Its also possible she&#39;s not <br/>\nterribly &quot;self aware&quot; in ways that can be expressed verbally - so if <br/>\nyou ask &quot;what do you want&quot; she&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; but if you give <br/>\nher the space and resources to do what she wants, she&#39;s good at <br/>\nfiguring out what it is she&#39;s wanting to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of that may be personality/ learning styles. Some may well be <br/>\nwhat&#39;s called &quot;asynchronous development&quot; where a kid learns one set <br/>\nof skills faster than others. The only real *problem* with that is <br/>\nthat adults develop expectations of kids, in particular, based on <br/>\njust one set of skills - typically verbal skills. So a child who has <br/>\na big vocabulary is &quot;supposed&quot; to be able to handle more mature <br/>\nsituations and challenges. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe run into that problem all the time with Ray. He&#39;s really verbal <br/>\nand outgoing, but his interpersonal skills haven&#39;t been as advanced <br/>\nas his vocabulary and enthusiasm (although they&#39;re catching up). <br/>\nEven George and I have to stop and remind ourselves ....hey, he&#39;s <br/>\njust a kid!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I<br/>\n&gt; sat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things <br/>\n </span></blockquote>together?&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; she&#39;d probably start muttering, say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, or start <br/>\n </span></blockquote>telling me a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; pony story.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Start listening to those stories!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there times when you can sit and watch her play the games or <br/>\nwatch a movie with her? Instead of trying to get her to do what you <br/>\nwant, connect with her passions. Is there a time you can go online <br/>\nyourself and play one of her games? Would she like that? Y&#39;all could <br/>\ntalk about your ponies together. At the least you&#39;d have more <br/>\ninformation and be better able to understand her stories. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay loves Runescape, which is an online d&d type game. George and I <br/>\nhave both played just enough that we can understand him when he <br/>\ntalks about it, rather than being so lost we glaze over. We have a <br/>\ncouple other computer games (not online) that Ray and I have played <br/>\nall the way through - that&#39;s been challenging for me, bc Ray loves <br/>\nto talk about what he&#39;s doing and can&#39;t seem to help giving me <br/>\ndetails I&#39;d rather find out on my own. We&#39;ve talked about different <br/>\nlearning styles, but mostly I just tell myself: its a game! and <br/>\nlisten to him enthuse about the battle he just fought with Badguy <br/>\nXyz to unlock portal Jkl - even though he&#39;s giving away the plot in <br/>\nthe process. Those conversations are really really important to Ray. <br/>\nThey are how he&#39;s connecting with us right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:  Moving from the opposite end of things","postDate":"1180196703","msgId":24072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTUwMWM3OWZiMiQ2YTcxYjNhMCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":24069,"nextInTopic":24073,"prevInTime":24071,"nextInTime":24073,"topicId":24066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** She doesn t have a love of learning.

Humans have a need to be comfortable before they take more on, and <br/>\nthe way we get comfortable is through immersion.   What you describe is very <br/>\nnormal.   Lots of adults have their own interests and are not looking for <br/>\nmore.  Think about your own life.  How much do you go out of your way to <br/>\nbecome interested in new things?<br/>\nI think some people are naturally curious and are always getting into <br/>\nsomething new.  Others are not.

How would it feel if you <br/>\nwere trying to talk to your partner about something you found interesting or <br/>\nimportant and your partner wandered off to do something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can&#39;t understand what she says when<br/>\nshe&#39;s in her Story Mode, so we are left with no good way to communicate.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSit down and really focus on her while she tells the story.  Watch her pace <br/>\nand twirl and hop and crawl.  If you really focus on her two things will <br/>\nhappen.  One, you&#39;ll see how much joy her stories bring her, which will fill <br/>\nyou with joy too,  and two,  you&#39;ll begin to absorb the story in more ways <br/>\nthan just audio.    Watch and listen.  After awhile you&#39;ll realize you&#39;re <br/>\nunderstanding more than you thought and the things you don&#39;t understand you <br/>\ncan ask about.   I would sometimes say, &quot;Wait, wait, wait how did he get on <br/>\nthe rock again?&quot;   And Dylan would explain that part to me.    My son was a <br/>\nvery active story teller.  He used to climb onto the washing machine and <br/>\njump off, spin on his knees on the floor, run and pace and hop.   He would <br/>\ncrawl under a box and keep talking the whole time.  He used a lot of sound <br/>\neffects.   There&#39;s an enormous amount of energy in those stories.  They&#39;re <br/>\nreally worth paying attention to! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***She refuses to<br/>\nwrite her stories down or type them,***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really not her responsibility to entertain you, or do things your way, <br/>\nor to help you understand her.  It&#39;s *your* responsibility to find ways to <br/>\nunderstand her and to make her world interesting for her.   Right now that <br/>\nmeans being a good audience for her stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n***So we generally ignore each other most of the day.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like &quot;strewing&quot; or a &quot;rich environment.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you tried recording her stories?   I have recordings of Dylan and <br/>\nthey&#39;re so much fun.  In one story he&#39;s a reporter covering an attack on <br/>\nTokyo by Godzilla.   Some of the story is inaudible because he was zooming <br/>\nall around while telling it, but most of it is there and it was fun to <br/>\nrecord and now it&#39;s fun to hear all those stories again.<br/>\n<br/>\n***If I sat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things <br/>\ntogether?&quot;<br/>\nshe&#39;d probably start muttering, say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, or start telling me a<br/>\npony story.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really all the information you need.  -Listen to her stories. -   Do <br/>\nwhat *she* wants.  Don&#39;t try to make her do what you want.  Do what she <br/>\nwants.  Be her audience.  That&#39;s how you connect; by getting into her world. <br/>\nIf she is coming to you with a story she is trying to connect with you. <br/>\nThe problem isn&#39;t your daughter, or the way she talks, or anything else, the <br/>\nproblem is you&#39;re not listening to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan drew lots of pictures of his different story characters and we still <br/>\npull those pictures out sometimes and talk about them.  He remembers all <br/>\nthose characters and I can say &quot;Do you remember when Soozee thought the <br/>\ndynamite was a firecracker and tossed it in Joey&#39;s bedroom window?&quot; <br/>\n(Soozee and Joey were mice, Soozee had a pearl head corsage pin for a <br/>\nsword.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she draw pictures of her characters?  You could hang them around the <br/>\nhouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote pages and pages of notes about Dylan&#39;s story telling and stories. <br/>\nI remember those days so fondly and I sort of suspect some of his characters <br/>\nwill make it into a book one day, they were all so well developed.  One <br/>\ncharacter was based on our huge Siamese cat, Zoey.  We call her Zooz.  Her <br/>\nstory line was called &quot;Bad News, It&#39;s Zooz!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;   Zoey is twenty pounds of <br/>\nSiamese attitude and she has a bizarre fuzzy black Hitler mustache that <br/>\nmakes her look especially comical.  I would write down funny quotes from his <br/>\ncharacters and tape them to the cupboards and fridge and Dylan enjoyed <br/>\nseeing them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Dylan was asleep and Zoey did something funny, when he woke up I would <br/>\ntell him the story about what Zoe had done.  I would try to make it as funny <br/>\nas I could and it would inspire new stories about Zooz.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it *is* hard to always pay attention to a long story. You&#39;ll get better <br/>\nat it. &lt;g&gt;   I didn&#39;t have another child but there were  pets to take care <br/>\nof and house work and garden and other things I liked or wanted to do.   It <br/>\nmight not be easy for you to focus on her but as much as possible you should <br/>\ndo it.  Your two year old might really like to be with you and sister while <br/>\nyour older child is telling a very active and energetic story.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Moving from the opposite end of things","postDate":"1180192019","msgId":24069,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5MDIyNi4zODIwLnFtQHdlYjUzODEwLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMyNzI3NmNjMDcwNTI2MDYyMGszOWUwOTBiY3liNTVmNGVmZmU0YjJkZTA0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24066,"nextInTopic":24072,"prevInTime":24068,"nextInTime":24070,"topicId":24066,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter probably has Asperger s.

I&#39;ve not bothered to have her diagnosed, because I don&#39;t see the point of it..... She seems to LIKE being left to do her own thing. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I&#39;ve known lots of folks without Apergers -- or any other &#39;syndrome&#39; -- who like to be alone, who need to be alone.  Maybe she&#39;s just an introvert.  Nothing wrong with that.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  But she also doesn&#39;t seem to have much in common with the typical (if there is such a thing) unschooled kid. She doesn&#39;t have a love of learning. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Can you describe this typical unschooled kid who has a love of learning?  Does it look the same in every kid? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily sucking up knowledge. She spends her days watching movies over and over and over, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you breed and care for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Is she advancing to higher levels in those online games?  Is she taking on new kinds of animals, ones with different traits, abilities, or characteristics within the game? I can&#39;t think of an online or video game my boys play that doesn&#39;t involve increased strategy or more challenges for higher levels, and the introduction of new ideas as play progresses.  That is learning new things!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  New stuff just doesn&#39;t interest her.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Maybe new stuff you&#39;ve introduced doesn&#39;t do it for her, but I&#39;ll bet she is learning new things and finding more every day that she&#39;d like to learn.  I know that it may look like my boys are just playing with the same old legos day after day. Then one or the other (or both!) will bring out his newest lego design gadget to show us, and I can see what they&#39;ve been creating --trucks, buildings, motors, all kinds of new things.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Maybe she&#39;s doing great and I just don&#39;t see it. She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a set list of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t interesting. Not sure if I&#39;m making sense... I&#39;ll move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  Can you find the time to just be with her, seeing what really does speak to her interests?  Ask her what animals she&#39;s raising up on Furry Paws -- what kind, color, abilities, how many, why those particular ones?  Listen to her answers, not for whether they&#39;re something you can categorize as learning, but just as a window into what she loves. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I agree it can be hard with two kids, especially when the younger one is very demanding of our time and energy.  Maybe a mother&#39;s helper could spend time with your son for a few hours a couple of times a week.  With summer vacation, now might be a good time to find a willing young teenager to spend some time.  Or could your husband spend some one-on-one time with your son, to make time for you and your daughter to be together?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nMoody friends.

Well, I&#39;m finally ready to ask a<br/>\nquestion.  I have hesitated, I suppose, out of &quot;fear&quot; that you&#39;ll make me<br/>\nCHANGE.  (oh, no, not that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two kids- 8 1/2 and 2.  Neither have ever been to school of any<br/>\nsort... I don&#39;t even have a babysitter.  I vaguely tried some school workish<br/>\nstuff when my daughter was 4-5, but it never really came together and I was<br/>\nok with that.  I did briefly devise an awesome &quot;curriculum&quot; based on<br/>\nHogwarts stuff, but I was way more interested in it than my daughter was,<br/>\nso... I gave up.  She had just acquired a Leapster at that point and spent<br/>\nentire days playing on it.<br/>\nIt was fairly easy for me to trust the unschooling process because she<br/>\ntaught herself to read via LeapPad Phonics, all at her own interest and<br/>\npace, at the tender age of 4.  My family and in-laws were amazed and wanted<br/>\nto know how I&#39;d taught her to read so young... they glazed over when I told<br/>\nthem I hadn&#39;t taught her anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing enough, actually.  I think I fall into the<br/>\n&quot;benign neglect&quot; category, and I don&#39;t know what to DO about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have excuses for fading into this... but I won&#39;t delve into them here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter probably has Asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;ve not bothered to have her<br/>\ndiagnosed, because I don&#39;t see the point of it, but it runs rampant in my<br/>\nside of the family and she shows many of the signs.  She seems to LIKE being<br/>\nleft to do her own thing.  But she also doesn&#39;t seem to have much in common<br/>\nwith the typical (if there is such a thing) unschooled kid.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave a love of learning.  She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily<br/>\nsucking up knowledge.  She spends her days watching movies over and over and<br/>\nover, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you breed and<br/>\ncare for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood.  New stuff<br/>\njust doesn&#39;t interest her.  Maybe she&#39;s doing great and I just don&#39;t see<br/>\nit.  She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a set<br/>\nlist of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t interesting.  Not sure if<br/>\nI&#39;m making sense... I&#39;ll move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe and I lead rather parallel lives... it&#39;s hard for me to interact with<br/>\nher.  I am realizing that I have an auditory disorder of some sort... I have<br/>\ndifficulty understanding things I hear.  She has an unusual tempo of speech,<br/>\ncannot speak while standing still, and loves to tell endless stories about<br/>\nponies and magical creatures and cats and....  I can&#39;t understand much of<br/>\nwhat she says.  So I get bored.  And go do something else.  She refuses to<br/>\nwrite her stories down or type them, I can&#39;t understand what she says when<br/>\nshe&#39;s in her Story Mode, so we are left with no good way to communicate.<br/>\nSo we generally ignore each other most of the day.<br/>\nThis doesn&#39;t seem like &quot;strewing&quot; or a &quot;rich environment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother challenge is my 2-yo.  He is exceptionally energetic, intense,<br/>\nchallenging, etc.  So my daughter gets shortchanged a lot, while I take care<br/>\nof my son&#39;s needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably just an excuse, though.  Many families have more than one<br/>\nkid and manage to live happy, connected lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I will get to my point- I want us to learn more together.  I want us to<br/>\nDO more together.  But I don&#39;t know that my daughter would respond well to<br/>\nit.  It&#39;s hard to have a deep conversation with her... questions of any sort<br/>\ngenerally confuse her.  She has to be in the perfect right mood to be able<br/>\nto converse.  I know that&#39;s rather strange, but... that&#39;s who she is.  If I<br/>\nsat her down and said &quot;Honey, would you like to DO more things together?&quot;<br/>\nshe&#39;d probably start muttering, say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, or start telling me a<br/>\npony story.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do I connect after &quot;just living together&quot; for so long?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll include one more detail that keeps popping into my mind, that I suppose<br/>\nmight be part of the problem.  I don&#39;t think she TRUSTS me.  Her dad and I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get married until she was 3.  Until that time she hadn&#39;t seen him and<br/>\nwe lived with my mom.  My mom and daughter are VERY close... they &quot;get&quot; each<br/>\nother and have a lot in common.  We moved 1000 miles away from my mom when I<br/>\ngot married.  I don&#39;t know what my daughter thought about that, because she<br/>\nwas a very late talker, but she HATES her dad.  Still.  Maybe in her mind<br/>\nDad = No Grandma or something, but she has absolutely no connection to her<br/>\ndad and used to tell me how much she wanted me to divorce him.  (I am 100%<br/>\ncertain there is no abuse going on, by the way.)  I feel like she thinks I&#39;m<br/>\nchoosing him over her, and that&#39;s a big wall between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlright, I think this is long enough now.  Do what you all do so well... ask<br/>\nme questions, bring out the bright and glaring light of truth... I know it<br/>\nwon&#39;t be comfortable, and I&#39;m ok with that.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBekki<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24083,"nextTopicId":24090}}
