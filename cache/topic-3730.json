(Just because it made the math easy, lol!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my motivations for doing it was that I was going insane with <br/>\nall the requests for toys. He wants so much. He&#39;ll pick up a catalog <br/>\nand spend hours looking at it, talking to me about what he wants, <br/>\nasking for it, begging for it, etc. This will go on for a few days, <br/>\nthen settle down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt hasn&#39;t changed that much since he started having his own money. <br/>\nI&#39;m not sure the amount is a good fit for him. He only saves the <br/>\nmoney if we don&#39;t go to a store! There&#39;s a toy he&#39;s wanted for a <br/>\ncouple months, but he never saves up to $15 to get it. He just got a <br/>\nnew Thomas catalog in the mail and is asking for tons of expensive <br/>\nstuff. He&#39;d have to save for 2-3 months for some of it and that ain&#39;t <br/>\ngonna happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been spending a lot less on toys, due to some financial <br/>\nissues, so I&#39;m reluctant to buy some of this expensive stuff. I could <br/>\nraise his allowance to $7 or even $10, but 1)he might continue to <br/>\nspend it on whatever is in the store and not be any closer to <br/>\nthe &#39;big toys&#39; and therefore still be unhappy and 2)I&#39;m not sure it <br/>\nwould be enough to meet his need for shopping and buying. I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow how high I&#39;d have to go for that, and I don&#39;t know if we can <br/>\nafford to find out!<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, I could also match funds if he saves--when you save $10, I&#39;ll <br/>\nadd $5...<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one right answer, but I&#39;m <br/>\ncompletely confused about what I&#39;m trying to provide for him. I guess <br/>\nI was hoping that giving him control over a small amount would be <br/>\nbetter than not having control over a larger amount. Maybe not...<br/>\n<br/>\n--aj, off to ebay to see how much cheaper we could get some of <br/>\nMikey&#39;s current favorites</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3715,"nextTopicId":3735}}
