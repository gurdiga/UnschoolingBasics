My husband Charles is also 32. He works <br/>\nat Best Buy during the day and is a jazz musician (tenor sax) at <br/>\nnight. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn between diaper changes, I am starting a nonprofit group which is a <br/>\nwonderful challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in rural central VA on 100 acres. We recently (March) moved here <br/>\nfrom NYC, so we are still adjusting to country life. We love it here <br/>\nthough. It&#39;s going to be a great place to unschool. DH and I joke that <br/>\nwhen Charlotte asks for a pony we&#39;ll just say okay. Not the answer she <br/>\nwould have gotten had we stayed in our 1-bedroom in NYC!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there&#39;s anything else you want to know about me, please feel free to <br/>\nask. I am usually running on fumes, so I apologize in advance if any of <br/>\nmy posts are nonsensical. I&#39;m going to provide some unintentional <br/>\namusement with my typos I&#39;m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recognize some of the names I see here from unschooling.com and I look <br/>\nforward to learning from all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay Berry Owens<br/>\nSAHM to Charlotte, 14 months</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2388,"nextTopicId":2335}}
