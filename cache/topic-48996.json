I don&#39;t feel very lovable : I know my parents love me but never felt it, I can sometimes feel my husband loves me... but I often wonder why.

It is what it is - a preference at that moment.  I don&#39;t take it to mean that he loves me any less.  I feel like if I honor his preferences, that he will feel accepted -like his feelings are okay to have and his preferences are okay to have.  In my opinion this is an opportunity to build our relationship because he can trust me to still love and accept him even if he wants to play with someone else.  If I don&#39;t accept his feelings, he might feel rejected or that his feelings and preferences are wrong, which is not true.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYoung kids are likely to say what they feel and at age 3 or 4 they don&#39;t even know how to phrase things kindly just yet or take the care to phrase things so that they don&#39;t hurt another&#39;s feelings.  That comes in time from hearing others say things kindly and softly and sometimes explaining without shame or blame what they might say next time to be considerate of others.  I don&#39;t think it does them or us any good to make them feel guilty about how they are feeling or who they are wanting to spend time with.  With regard to how they say things, we can&#39;t make them act older than they really are or have the skills of an adult or be more thoughtful than they are capable of being.  When I&#39;m told bluntly that they want to play with just the other person, I say, &quot;Oh, you just want to play with xyz?  Okay, I&#39;ll leave.&quot; and then go off and do my own thing or catch up on something that I&#39;ve been meaning to get to or hang out with one of the other kids.  That one on one time with someone you love is so nice to have.  See if you can appreciate that they can spend that time together instead of feel like the odd one out.  Maybe go make them a special cake or snack for your two favorite guys for after they are done playing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are thinking your said or did something that hurt your child&#39;s feelings and that is why he is preferring Daddy at the moment, apologize.  But don&#39;t put it on him to accept your apology so that you can feel better.  Apologize and move on to better times.  I guess you won&#39;t know for sure why your son is feeling the way he is, but you could choose to honor his feelings no matter what.  Let the love you have for him help you to do so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are hoping to add another child to your family down the road, you may be extra appreciative that your son and husband like to spend one on one time together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] child rejecting mom","postDate":"1346619654","msgId":49000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFQjJDMTY0LTU2QkUtNDNDNy05NEE4LTExQTFEMzU2OUE3NUBhb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxdnVkZStrcWIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGsxdnVkZStrcWIyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48999,"nextInTopic":49007,"prevInTime":48999,"nextInTime":49001,"topicId":48996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Enjoy.
