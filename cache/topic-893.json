We have money. We know more people and know more about what&#39;s <br/>\nin the world. We can be a major resource for our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara Sher is going to one of the speakers at the Live and Learn <br/>\nUnschooling conference. Her book, Wishcraft, has influenced my own unschooling journey <br/>\nmore than any other, and it&#39;s not a book about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an excerpt from the book (available online and free, by the way, at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wishcraft.com/)\">http://wishcraft.com/)</a> that made me an unschooling mama (although I didn&#39;t know <br/>\nit at the time):<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;4. Were you encouraged to explore all your own talents and interests even <br/>\n </span></blockquote>if they changed from day to day? <br/>\nThat means when you came in at the age of 7 and said, “Mama, I am going to be <br/>\na movie star,” she said, “You know, you might be good at that.” Then she got <br/>\nout the Super-8, let you put on her makeup, took a movie of you, let you see <br/>\nit, and showed you and your best friend how to use the camera. And two days or <br/>\ntwo months later, when you announced, “I’m given up my career as an actress. <br/>\nI’ve decided to be a fireman and rescue people, “ she said, “Sounds good to <br/>\nme. Want to go over to the firehouse and look at the engines?” The key word is <br/>\nexplore. Childhood is a great time for trying out all the myriad <br/>\npossibilities of your being. (Adulthood isn’t a bad time for doing that either, as you’ll <br/>\nfind out as we go along.) And taking a child’s talents and interests “<br/>\nseriously” does not mean expecting a 7-year-old to choose her lifetime career.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you just read that one chapter of Barbara&#39;s book, it can change <br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, MA!<br/>\nFor more information, go to www.LiveandLearnConference.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74604204,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"Deb Lewis &lt;ddzimlew@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] teaching vs. learning","postDate":"1088312849","msgId":1150,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjI2LjIzMDcyOS4xMTA4LjEuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":1142,"nextInTopic":1173,"prevInTime":1149,"nextInTime":1151,"topicId":893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** How would you go about explaining to a teen, who expects to be taught, that the reigns are being turned over to them?

If a person has come to believe, through public schooling or<br/>\nschool at home, that learning is something must be imparted by a teacher<br/>\n- someone trained - an expert,  it could be very intimidating to be told<br/>\n&quot;learning&quot; is now their responsibility.   I wouldn&#39;t talk about it in<br/>\nthose terms at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would talk about my own developing ideas about learning.  I would<br/>\nexplore with that person, my new view of learning and teaching and the<br/>\nvalue of self discovery.   I would try to find examples of people who<br/>\npursued a passion and ended up doing the things they love.  I would talk<br/>\nabout the way humans learned before there was school.   I would talk<br/>\nabout the fact that each child is born already suited to life as a human,<br/>\nand will naturally be interested in the things humans are interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would try to let go of any expectation I might have that the person<br/>\nneeded to be making progress toward a goal.  The stress of other people&#39;s<br/>\nexpectations of us, especially when we&#39;re young, can be stifling to<br/>\nimagination and creativity and possibility.   They might be making<br/>\nprogress in ways that aren&#39;t visible.  They might be gaining self<br/>\nconfidence, adjusting to new freedom, exploring feelings, etc.  I would<br/>\nwork at trusting their process.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would offer to help them find the things they&#39;d like to do.  I&#39;d be<br/>\nsympathetic if they had trouble deciding.  I would  try to give them more<br/>\nexposure to things they like and I&#39;d take them to new and interesting<br/>\nplaces. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not say the equivalent of &quot;It&#39;s all up to you now.&quot;  I think that<br/>\ncould be intimidating if someone had always believed they needed the help<br/>\nof an expert in order to learn.   They could feel unprepared and<br/>\nunqualified.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":120281009,"authorName":"cris","from":"&quot;cris&quot; &lt;muddpies@...&gt;","profile":"thinkspringblooms","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: teaching vs. learning","postDate":"1088306027","msgId":1142,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNibGUxYis5Zm90QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjI2LjE1NTkxNC4xODY1Mi4xMTcwMDZAd2VibWFpbDA2Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1128,"nextInTopic":1150,"prevInTime":1141,"nextInTime":1143,"topicId":893,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... who expects ...

One needs to really examine ones<br/>\nattitude when sharing/ teaching so that we can catch ourselves if we become<br/>\ntoo controlling or condescending.  Once the mutual respect is in place in<br/>\nthe relationship, there is no need to wory about whether we are teaching,<br/>\ninstructing, facilitating learning, pointing out something interesting,<br/>\nwhatever.  It&#39;s all good in the context of a mutually respectful<br/>\nrelationship.  I say Trayton taught me something.  And truly, I was not<br/>\ninterested in Mario per se except that it&#39;s something that interests him. A<br/>\nlot.  And I love *him*.  So having him teach me that level was enjoyable for<br/>\nme because I got to admire how beautifully he communicates and enjoy his<br/>\npassion.

We are guides and facilitators not dictators and controllers.  I<br/>\nthink teaching can be done in a controlling relationship but that is not the<br/>\nonly place it is done.  Many of us take private lessons in one form or<br/>\nanother and are taught the basics of piano or ice-skating or marshal arts.<br/>\nSome instructors are bad, unkind, or ineffective others are wonderful<br/>\nempathic people for whom teaching is their highest calling.

I want to know NOW!&quot; She was about 6, had some smattering of <br/>\nreading ability, recognized letters/sounds, a very beginning reader I would say but <br/>\ndid not have a firm grip on reading and was frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went online and browsed books and together we chose the &quot;100 Easy Lessons&quot; <br/>\nbook. Now, if you have seen this book, you will know it is not particualrly <br/>\nunschooling. In and of itself.

We stopped because <br/>\nshe could then read well enough to do what she wanted to do and has since just <br/>\nread everything in sight, going to the library all the time, picking out her <br/>\nbooks, etc. She is 9 now and an excellent, confident reader.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there are ways and there are ways, imo, to use material. I think people <br/>\nmay rely on schoolish things for a while as they transition to more unschoolish <br/>\nways.
