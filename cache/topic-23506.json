That&#39;s been true with my son,  <br/>\nwhom I experienced as an incredibly easy baby and toddler, but who  <br/>\nbecame challenging for me starting around the age of 3 (he&#39;s almost 6  <br/>\nnow). In retrospect, I can see that some of the things that feed his  <br/>\nchallenging behaviors now were present when he was a baby and  <br/>\ntoddler, but were simply easier to address when our lives were so  <br/>\nsimple and I was more in charge of him and the environment. For  <br/>\ninstance, he has what we call &quot;random energy&quot; times when he&#39;s less  <br/>\nordered and controlled in his behavior; since about 3, these times  <br/>\nare really hard for us, and we haven&#39;t found a magic bullet for  <br/>\ndealing with it--he gets into these moods and he won&#39;t accept any  <br/>\nalternatives. One example: last night at dinner, he was dropping a  <br/>\nplastic disk onto the table to hear it land and rattle. It started to  <br/>\nreally bug his dad, who asked him to either stop doing it, or take it  <br/>\nto the coffee table a few feet away. He refused to do either. That&#39;s  <br/>\nreally typical when he&#39;s in that kind of mood. When he isn&#39;t in  <br/>\n&quot;random energy&quot; mode, he not only accepts that kind of problem- <br/>\nsolving but is really good at being the one who comes up with solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was little, if he was having &quot;random energy&quot; I could deal  <br/>\nwith it by simply finding something to focus his energy. We used to  <br/>\ngo to the library, where he would play with the train table for a  <br/>\nlong time. Or I could put him onto my bed with one basket of toys of  <br/>\none type, and the reduced stimulation would allow him to play happily  <br/>\nthere for an hour or more. It wasn&#39;t until I had a second kid who  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have &quot;random energy&quot; times as a baby and toddler, and who  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need me to intervene to modify his environment for him in that  <br/>\nway, that I realized that Eric wasn&#39;t actually all that easy a baby  <br/>\nand toddler! And as Eric has gotten older and his world has gotten  <br/>\nbigger and more complex, it hasn&#39;t been as easy for me to see what  <br/>\nwill help--or to make it happen if I have an idea that I think would.  <br/>\nHe might refuse a suggestion that I&#39;m pretty sure would help, for  <br/>\ninstance.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of things that have helped me:<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone likes these books, and I think it&#39;s best to skip the  <br/>\n&quot;discipline&quot; parts, but the &quot;Your X-Year-Old&quot; books have been helpful  <br/>\nfor us in recognizing that Eric&#39;s behaviors are generally normal for  <br/>\nhis age. I remember reading the Your 4-Year-Old one, and by the sixth  <br/>\nor seventh page, I called my partner on the phone and said, &quot;I have a  <br/>\ndiagnosis for Eric! Apparently, he&#39;s four!&quot; The Your 6-Year-Old book  <br/>\nhas accurately described some new behaviors of Eric&#39;s, a kind of  <br/>\nconstant bouncy moving energy--he almost never sits still these days-- <br/>\nand that has helped me just let go of any attempts to make him sit  <br/>\nstill while he&#39;s eating or being read to, for instance, or when we&#39;re  <br/>\ntalking and he&#39;s bouncing off the walls and furniture (literally)  <br/>\nwhile we talk. Some parents are really gifted at just accepting their  <br/>\nkids as they are, and recognizing patterns of behavior on their own,  <br/>\nbut I find it helpful sometimes to look at developmental guides like  <br/>\nthat--thoughtfully and with my bullshit filters turned on &quot;high.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though Eric isn&#39;t really &quot;explosive&quot; per se, I recently read the  <br/>\nbook &quot;Your Explosive Child&quot; and found it really helpful. It  <br/>\nreinforced the idea of lowering the global frustration level of a kid  <br/>\nwho is easily frustrated, for instance. It also reinforced my own  <br/>\nideas that Eric&#39;s behavior when he&#39;s in &quot;random energy&quot; mode (the  <br/>\nauthor calls it &quot;vapor lock&quot;) can&#39;t be judged by the same standards  <br/>\nas when he&#39;s more ordered. Yesterday, for instance, Eric called me a  <br/>\n&quot;fuckin&#39; buckin!&quot; and I just let it go by, because when he is not in  <br/>\nRE mode, he is a respectful and affectionate kid. Also, the idea that  <br/>\nit takes an inflexible kid PLUS an inflexible parent to create a  <br/>\nmeltdown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 1, 2007, at 9:12 AM, Sharissa13 wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; but it never is enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be hard when you feel like &quot;no matter what I do, it&#39;s not  <br/>\nenough for him.&quot; We have that here, sometimes, because Eric has a  <br/>\nhard time (sometimes) transitioning away from beloved activities.

He asked something like, &quot;How would  <br/>\nyou feel if you just didn&#39;t know the thing your kid is doing was  <br/>\nsupposed to be annoying?&quot; That has really stuck with me. Sometimes,  <br/>\nwith Eric, I just breathe deeply and let things flow on by (and  <br/>\nsometimes I turn into a raging volcano of irritated nerves, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nworking on it).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t take<br/>\n&gt; him into any store without him demanding that I buy<br/>\n&gt; him something.<br/>\n<br/>\nEric&#39;s got neophilia big time--he likes new stuff. Even if,  <br/>\nsometimes, it&#39;s almost exactly like his old stuff. We were getting  <br/>\ninto some conflict about spending money on stuff every time we went  <br/>\ngrocery shopping. I usually only had a few dollars, so he was getting  <br/>\na lot of cheap stuff that wasn&#39;t holding his attention, but he didn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to wait and save up for something cooler. I was getting  <br/>\nfrustrated at the proliferation of cheap toys that weren&#39;t getting  <br/>\nplayed with. Some things that have helped:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I figured out that I could do the grocery shopping every other  <br/>\nweek instead of every week. So now, he only asks for something new  <br/>\nhalf as often! It&#39;s not the only reason I experimented with bi-weekly  <br/>\ngrocery shopping, but it&#39;s been a really nice side benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I started setting aside a monthly amount of money for him (and  <br/>\nCarl) to spend on whatever they wanted. Eric doesn&#39;t want an  <br/>\nallowance per se, but I&#39;m sort of thinking of it that way. When I do  <br/>\nour monthly budgeting, I think about how much I can afford for that.  <br/>\nI tell Eric what it is. Because it&#39;s a &quot;per month&quot; amount, it allows  <br/>\nthem to buy something bigger if they want. Eric has been fine about  <br/>\naccepting that there&#39;s then less money later in the month (so far).  <br/>\nIt also helps me not be arbitrary--letting them spend more if I&#39;m in  <br/>\na generous mood but being stingy if I&#39;m feeling frustrated about all  <br/>\nthe plastic on the living room floor at home. I don&#39;t have to make a  <br/>\ncase-by-case &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; decision. It keeps me mellower.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; And if I don&#39;t (which I normally don&#39;t,<br/>\n&gt; no matter what)<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you have money for something, I wonder? Maybe he needs to  <br/>\nhear &quot;yes&quot; more than he is. Are there good reasons why you can&#39;t buy  <br/>\nhim things now and again?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; .. he breaks down into a crying/whining<br/>\n&gt; fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to avoid words like &quot;fit.&quot; You didn&#39;t say &quot;throw a fit&quot;  <br/>\nor &quot;pitch a fit&quot; but those are phrases I&#39;ve had to be on guard  <br/>\nagainst. I try to use more neutral language: &quot;It&#39;s hard for him to  <br/>\naccept &#39;no.&#39; He becomes really frustrated and cries and  <br/>\nwhines.&quot; (&quot;whine&quot; is a really loaded word, too, but sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>\nthe only accurate one, IME.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Then we&#39;ll get in the car and he&#39;ll demand that I<br/>\n&gt; buy him chicken nuggets,<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you resist &quot;demands&quot;? Is there a good reason he can&#39;t have chicken  <br/>\nnuggets?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; and try to insist that I<br/>\n&gt; promised him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lying stuff is hard to take, but if he&#39;s hearing &quot;no&quot; too much,  <br/>\nit may be his way of trying to get to a &quot;yes&quot; sometimes. Maybe he  <br/>\nneeds his cup filled up a bit more. It&#39;s counter-intuitive, but  <br/>\ngiving him what he&#39;s asking for more for awhile--even when it&#39;s hard  <br/>\nfor you, even when you&#39;re tired and have needs of your own you&#39;re  <br/>\nhaving to put on hold--can get the two of you to a better place. At  <br/>\nleast, it can with Eric. At least, it lets me spend more time with  <br/>\nthe Eric I enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not as good at this as I should be, but when my own meter is  <br/>\nrunning low, it helps if I can draw on other resources (adults, my  <br/>\npartner) to top me off rather than pulling back from giving to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when we&#39;re having a rough time, I clear the calendar and  <br/>\ntry to spend a few days doing things he enjoys and where he can be  <br/>\n&quot;in charge.&quot; A trip to the zoo, for instance, where he gets to say  <br/>\nwhat animals we visit and for how long.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy--nothing with Eric has been a magic fix. We haven&#39;t  <br/>\nbeen able to reliably identify triggers for this kind of mood, though  <br/>\ntiredness is definitely one. So I don&#39;t want you to take anything I&#39;m  <br/>\nsaying as coming from someone who solved this problem and has a magic  <br/>\nperfect relationship with her kid. It&#39;s definitely ongoing for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8667530,"authorName":"Manisha Kher","from":"Manisha Kher &lt;m_kher@...&gt;","profile":"m_kher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: behavior issues (Off Topic)","postDate":"1178030101","msgId":23523,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5NTc4OC4zNzkwNy5xbUB3ZWI1NDQwNy5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxMTI3OC45MzY0OC5xbUB3ZWIzNjEwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":23521,"nextInTopic":23525,"prevInTime":23522,"nextInTime":23524,"topicId":23506,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... we ve been trying to give him attention ...

Spending more time with the <br/>\nkids - really being attentive to them, not doing housework or <br/>\nwhatever in the same room - you will have the opportunity to see <br/>\nmore of what&#39;s leading up to this behavior and find some patterns. <br/>\nAre some of his needs not being met?

It <br/>\nmay be that Alex sees someone trying to reason with him as a power-<br/>\nplay. After all, it *is* an effort to explain why he can&#39;t do/have <br/>\nwhat he wants - its only natural that he would respond with a power <br/>\nplay of his own, like laughing.
