Dh <br/>\nhave come to see we have been home/unschooling since birth, but have <br/>\nbeen a little anxious as the &#39;big step&#39; of not sending older dd to<br/>\nkindergarten in the fall approaches. I have been researching<br/>\nhomeschooling for several years, and have gone back and forth about<br/>\nusing curriculum, but keep coming back to unschooling, or very<br/>\nrelaxed &#39;methods&#39;. I asked my dh recently how he feels we should <br/>\nproceed in the fall with homeschooling, and although he does not <br/>\nread, and research lie I do, he surprised me by saying, &#39;why do <br/>\nanything different than what we are doing now?&#39; At this point we both <br/>\nsee the girls learning all the time, and older dd resists teaching of <br/>\nany sort, so we feel we are on the right path, doing what we are <br/>\ndoing! It was so great to hear this comment from him, as he was not <br/>\nopen to school at home, let alone the idea of unschooling when I <br/>\nfirst brought up the possiblity. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recognize many of you from other unschooling lists I have been <br/>\nvisiting, as well as a postive discipline list I am on. The insight <br/>\nand support I have been getting has been so helpful, and I am excited <br/>\nabout this list for the opportunity to ask more questions, since it <br/>\nis aimed specifically for those beginning the journey. We have been <br/>\nmaking many changes in our parenting and lifestyle, out of recent re-<br/>\nexamination, and the changes are resembling the unschooling mindset <br/>\nmore and more, and proving to be positive, although at the same time <br/>\ndh and I are still struggling for understanding as we deschool our <br/>\nthinking.  We have very little support from family (mostly <br/>\nnegativity, actually), and know few homeschoolers at this point. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a few questions/issues that I&#39;d like to present right away, <br/>\nbut think I will break them up into separate posts to avoid getting <br/>\ntoo lengthy with my intro.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this opportunity, Ren, Rue & others!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":163,"nextTopicId":62}}
