These are so divergent araas. And what ift you start out on three &#39;mother tongues&#39; at the same time like my grandchildren? They &#39;speak&#39; in German with me, in English with their parents and in Afrikaans with their other grandparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nToddlers do have to &#39;use language&#39; to get by somehow. My youngest granddaughter is quite capable of &#39;sounding&#39; words but she finds it so much more effective to you &#39;ahahah&#39; through her &#39;demands&#39; and use sign language to get herself &#39;heard&#39;. Which she does. I see unschooling as a way to allow these children to be who they are regardless of the demands of society. My youngest, nearly 17 year old son has great difficulty in using the correct &#39;Der, Die, Das&#39; format in German. English is so much asier to use in this regard. I guess it is only a matter of time that he will prefer to rather speak with me in English to evade my &#39;energetic&#39; displeasure at his &#39;unconsciously wrong&#39; use of the wrong &#39;inflection.&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87710633,"authorName":"juillet727","from":"&quot;juillet727&quot; &lt;juillet727@...&gt;","profile":"juillet727","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: age segregation WAS Video games revisited","postDate":"1241808509","msgId":39986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1MXVwdCt2aGV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGQxYS40MTU0ZTRhOC4zNzM0OGRkOEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39985,"nextInTopic":39987,"prevInTime":39985,"nextInTime":39987,"topicId":39965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...His girlfriend asserted that English classes were important Just imagine how much worse language would be if we didn t learn how to use it? ...

The statement sounds so detached--like we don&#39;t learn any language skills until we learn it from school or something. Or as if language is this big separate thing, apart from we who use it, static and unchanging, and we have to learn to use it or something. And language changes all the time; we don&#39;t speak english from the middle ages anymore. And spelling only got standardized, what, 150 yrs ago or something. And today&#39;s language is changing because of texting and computer usage--breaking up paragraphs so they are more easily read, getting creative with grammar. The written word is getting more conversational.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you imagine thinking that toddlers had to &quot;learn to use language&quot;? What a mess that would be. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one of the things that nobody learns from a book or an expert, we learn from our family or from others and we learn by doing. And if we&#39;re talking about unschooling--learning from living life--language should be the most obvious example of natural learning.

The<br/>\n&gt; hope is that everyone will learn and grow from these experiences.

I have teens (mostly schooled because my ex was extremely anti HS,<br/>\nthough i&#39;ve made a my best effort over the years to counterbalance the<br/>\nindoctrination) and two year old twins (already magically and successfully<br/>\nunschooling). I can tell more about me later, when its pertinent, but right<br/>\nnow I have a question about this Age Segregation business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on the board of a brand new non-profit with a mission of building<br/>\nintergenearational connections.  From my personal POV, I think its really,<br/>\nreally sad that we have to manufacture opportunities for the different<br/>\ngenerations to connect. We&#39;re developing programs now in an attempt to do<br/>\njust that.  But, what I really, really want is to make those interactions<br/>\neasy and natural, rather than forced and contrived.  Our programs will be<br/>\nfor the whole community, and mostly for schooled children/teens to get<br/>\ntogether with people 40+ who are not authority figures in their lives.  The<br/>\nhope is that everyone will learn and grow from these experiences.  You all<br/>\nhave been watching your children develop these kinds of connections<br/>\nnaturally...the way I hope we can with our programs.  So, I was wondering if<br/>\nyou would have any advice or ideas for programs that would encourage the<br/>\ntruly age segregated folks out there to blur those lines in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much!<br/>\nLaura in Alaska<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, May 7, 2009 at 11:17 AM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; **It also makes me happy that my son&#39;s Guild in WoW has no issues with the<br/>\n&gt; younger players.
