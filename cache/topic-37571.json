I applied and took the little test and it was a month or more till they sent me the paperwork to fill out with my personal information. Then it was another month and a half almost before I got the welcome e-mail for me to log on to start training. Though I do not think most people wait as long for the second half. Just keep checking your junk mail folder because their stuff ends up there sometimes. The campain I signed up for pays $7-$9 an hour and even if you get no calls you do make min wage for your state. Also they take out your taxes and stuff so that is nice. I will most likley start the training tomorrow night and I will get paid $6.55 an hour for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sun, 1/4/09, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] other forms of work to be able to stay home<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Date: Sunday, January 4, 2009, 10:47 PM<br/>\n&gt; Lisa,<br/>\n&gt; I would not mind knowing a bit more about this.
