Doing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; household tasks, for example - when he didn&#39;t really have a choice,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he made the best of things and &quot;gladly&quot; pitched in to help. Once he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; realized he really really could say no and that was okay, he had to<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; take some time to find his own motivation to do the same things. But<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; we had to *really* be okay with him not doing *any* housework for<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; awhile to the point of not even asking him to help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It helped me and George to focus on the fact that what *we* really<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wanted was a home where generosity and kindness were the norm. You<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t demand that someone be kind or generous - those have to come<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; from within. So in order for Ray to feel generous, we had to heap<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; generosity upon him. In order for him to be spontaneously kind, we<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; had to envelop him in kindness.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; In some ways it worked very quickly! But housework took awhile.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; About a year and a half (he left school at 13).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;He&#39;s not eating what I would consider healthily, even when the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; healthy food is presented.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Eventually he will choose to eat healthier foods, but right now he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs to do a little experimenting - that&#39;s how people learn what<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kinds of foods make them feel good.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;presented&quot;? Are you making monkey-platters and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s just eating the chips and cookies and leaving the pbj and<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; carrots? Refill the chips and cookies with a pleasant smile and know<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that eventually he&#39;ll choose other foods, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not getting enough sleep, though he is very quickly figuring out<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that he<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likes himself and his life better when he does have enough sleep.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;ll do the same with food in time. Use what you see changing<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; already to bolster your confidence. Radical unschooling works<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because kids *like* to feel good, physically and emotionally. Eating<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; well helps that, and in time he&#39;ll feel that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277736389,"authorName":"HoneyBeeECPlus3@aol.com","from":"HoneyBeeECPlus3@...","profile":"traceec1997","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New Unschooler","postDate":"1223565694","msgId":36490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQUY4MzlEOTdCNTRDMS0xNDM4LTExMDdAV0VCTUFJTC1NQTA5LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUzNDI5NjIyLTJCNzktNDQzRi05REFCLTAwNTI4MDA1MjYxREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEUzNDI5NjIyLTJCNzktNDQzRi05REFCLTAwNTI4MDA1MjYxREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":36478,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":36489,"nextInTime":36491,"topicId":3830,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"good point joyce.? ...

Doing <br/>\n<br/>\n  household tasks, for example - when he didn&#39;t really have a choice, <br/>\n<br/>\n  he made the best of things and &quot;gladly&quot; pitched in to help. Once he <br/>\n<br/>\n  realized he really really could say no and that was okay, he had to <br/>\n<br/>\n  take some time to find his own motivation to do the same things. But <br/>\n<br/>\n  we had to *really* be okay with him not doing *any* housework for <br/>\n<br/>\n  awhile to the point of not even asking him to help. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It helped me and George to focus on the fact that what *we* really <br/>\n<br/>\n  wanted was a home where generosity and kindness were the norm. You <br/>\n<br/>\n  can&#39;t demand that someone be kind or generous - those have to come <br/>\n<br/>\n  from within. So in order for Ray to feel generous, we had to heap <br/>\n<br/>\n  generosity upon him. In order for him to be spontaneously kind, we <br/>\n<br/>\n  had to envelop him in kindness. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In some ways it worked very quickly! But housework took awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\n  About a year and a half (he left school at 13). <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;He&#39;s  not eating what I would consider healthily, even when the <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; healthy food is  presented.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Eventually he will choose to eat healthier foods, but right now he <br/>\n<br/>\n  needs to do a little experimenting - that&#39;s how people learn what <br/>\n<br/>\n  kinds of foods make them feel good. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  What do you mean by &quot;presented&quot;? Are you making monkey-platters and <br/>\n<br/>\n  he&#39;s just eating the chips and cookies and leaving the pbj and <br/>\n<br/>\n  carrots? Refill the chips and cookies with a pleasant smile and know <br/>\n<br/>\n  that eventually he&#39;ll choose other foods, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;  He&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; not  getting enough sleep, though he is very quickly figuring out <br/>\n<br/>\n  that he <br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; likes  himself and his life better when he does have enough sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  He&#39;ll do the same with food in time. Use what you see changing <br/>\n<br/>\n  already to bolster your confidence. Radical unschooling works <br/>\n<br/>\n  because kids *like* to feel good, physically and emotionally. Eating <br/>\n<br/>\n  well helps that, and in time he&#39;ll feel that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  ---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n      <br/>\n                                                <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New Unschooler","postDate":"1223469840","msgId":36415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDA4MDU0NHAzZTdlMjRkOHA5ZWZkMTFmNTA5MjJiMWZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdjZ3A3dCs2bGVpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNkNC4zYWEzYzNmNC4zNjFhYzU1NkBhb2wuY29tPiA8Z2NncDd0KzZsZWlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36405,"nextInTopic":36445,"prevInTime":36414,"nextInTime":36416,"topicId":3830,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
