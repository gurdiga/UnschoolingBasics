My gut is telling <br/>\nme not to lie to my son.  My stepson believes in Santa and the tooth fairy, <br/>\nfairies, and various other things that I don&#39;t.  I certainly don&#39;t plan to burst <br/>\nhis bubble because that was a choice his parents made (including my DH).  <br/>\nRelated to the fairies, I just tell him that everyone believes different things <br/>\nand that is ok.  I don&#39;t have a problem with him believing in fairies.  I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever seen God and I still believe he/she exists, so who am I to tell him he <br/>\ncan&#39;t believe in fairies just because I&#39;ve never seen one!  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway... my son is under 2 and I think that stepson will find out about <br/>\nSanta by the time we have to actually discuss the topic with DS so it shouldn&#39;t be <br/>\na problem.  How do you all handle relatives who talk about Santa?  My parents <br/>\nwon&#39;t be a problem.  They know I&#39;m sort of &quot;different&quot; (heehee) but DH&#39;s <br/>\nfamily won&#39;t get it.  We were thinking we would just ignore it and stick with the <br/>\nthere-is-no-Santa thing in our own home.  Just tell him that Grandpa likes to <br/>\npretend Santa is real, or something like that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nBeth  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3008,"nextTopicId":3011}}
