She calls it &quot;the most non-judgmental environment I have ever been in.&quot; She really felt at home there, like she had found her tribe. She was also very impressed with the caliber of the teenagers there and that many of them had never  been in a classroom in their lives but were &quot;really accomplished...and at more than one thing!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI cant emphasize enough how removing her from school was the best decision I/we have ever made. Her last days at school were a disaster-showing up at noon, doing no work, getting disrespected by teachers, but for some reason she wanted to finish the eighth grade even tho I told her to just quit. I was whispered about by other parents for not disciplining her to conform. (Thank god I dont have to see those parents anymore what a bonus! I never really fit in either)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am so impressed with how much she has grown and how much she has learned not being in school. She is a different person now, or I should say she can now completely be who she really is. Its unfortunate that her best friend Carley still has to go to school, her parents are caught up in the whole charade of &quot;got-to-go-to-the-best-high-school-or-you-wont-get-into-a-good-college&quot; crap.

She begged me to &quot;home teach&quot;<br/>\n&gt; her all through first through third grades. (broke<br/>\n&gt; my heart) She had a few good years, 4th and 5th<br/>\n&gt; grades, due to some &quot;hippie teachers.&quot; By the end of<br/>\n&gt; eighth grade, she was a dismal unhappy mess, and<br/>\n&gt; decided of her own accord to blow off high school. I<br/>\n&gt; gave her &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; pointed her in the direction of Not Back To School<br/>\n&gt; Camp.  It was at NBTSC that she discovered<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling and chose that over Homeschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The last year has been a journey, to say the least.<br/>\n&gt; Nothing went as planned. I had planned to quit my<br/>\n&gt; job to facilitate her interests (not wanting to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;leave her to her own devices&quot;) and I had made some<br/>\n&gt; financial arrangements to make it happen (real<br/>\n&gt; estate investments) but life intervened, the real<br/>\n&gt; estate market tanked, I lost some money, my husband<br/>\n&gt; had back surgery knocking him out of commission for<br/>\n&gt; six months, ( putting me in primary breadwinner<br/>\n&gt; position)- long story short I could not quit my job.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anya did a whole lot of sleeping for several months.<br/>\n&gt; She told me her dreams were more vivid and enjoyable<br/>\n&gt; than ever, and she was experamenting with &quot;lucid<br/>\n&gt; dreaming.&quot; All fine with me. She spent time<br/>\n&gt; downloading music, maintaining her Myspace pages,<br/>\n&gt; surfing youtube, watching TV and reading whatever<br/>\n&gt; she wanted.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We moved and had no money for awhile while we<br/>\n&gt; carried three mortgages. No furniture in the new<br/>\n&gt; house, no money for any extras, but the other house<br/>\n&gt; finally sold and we bought furniture. She painted<br/>\n&gt; her new room turquoise, bought a black rug and black<br/>\n&gt; furniture, and put up music posters. Cut her long<br/>\n&gt; hair super short. Remarked that &quot;when you unschool<br/>\n&gt; you have lots of time to get to know yourself.<br/>\n&gt; School keeps you too stressed out to have an<br/>\n&gt; original thought.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; (How may times is my mother going to ask me if<br/>\n&gt; &quot;anyone from the district is monitoring her<br/>\n&gt; progress?&quot; )<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I noticed that she has &quot;dictionary.com&quot; bookmarked<br/>\n&gt; on her computer. She has read about 10 different<br/>\n&gt; books, all her own choices. She reads the paper and<br/>\n&gt; bakes cookies. Works out at the gym. Travels up to<br/>\n&gt; our vacation home in the Tahoe area and hangs out in<br/>\n&gt; our cabin. (for sale, BTW, any takers?) She took a<br/>\n&gt; college course in Digital Photography. She goes to<br/>\n&gt; SKA band concerts. AND -She got certified as a<br/>\n&gt; junior open water SCUBA diver!!  We went to Belize<br/>\n&gt; for 10 days where we spent four days diving the reef<br/>\n&gt; and four days in the jungle where she met a Belizean<br/>\n&gt; archaelogist and spent an entire evening discussing<br/>\n&gt; Mayan history and the lack of regard showed by the<br/>\n&gt; Discovery Channel while filming something they are<br/>\n&gt; calling &quot;Adventures of the Bone Detective. &quot;<br/>\n&gt; (written by a hollywood script writer with no<br/>\n&gt; interest in either archaeology or history). <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anya also got a job! I am proud of her because its<br/>\n&gt; pretty competitive in the teenage entry level market<br/>\n&gt; but she would not let anyone tell her she was too<br/>\n&gt; young. She found out the loopholes in the work<br/>\n&gt; permit system, and started applying everywhere. At<br/>\n&gt; one point, she was offered a job bussing tables at a<br/>\n&gt; restaurant but then they found out she was 14 and<br/>\n&gt; took back the offer. She finally got hired by<br/>\n&gt; Coldstone Creamery. She worked there for four months<br/>\n&gt; until the franchise was sold and the new owners laid<br/>\n&gt; everyone off. <br/>\n&gt; I am noticing she is far more focused somehow than<br/>\n&gt; her schooled friends. Her mental arithmatic has<br/>\n&gt; improved as well. <br/>\n&gt; Anya will be at Not Back To School Camp in Oregon<br/>\n&gt; this summer for both sessions. She has no desire to<br/>\n&gt; go back to school.  Life is so much better now that<br/>\n&gt; she is happier. She plans to find a job when she<br/>\n&gt; gets back, and still talks about passing the CHSPE,<br/>\n&gt; only now she wants to pass it for a different<br/>\n&gt; reason: to get the school district off her back<br/>\n&gt; about working.
