Andy does enjoy Family Guy, but avoids Adult Swim by choice.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Lately, there have been arguments because Dan will try to gain entry into Andy&#39;s room just to see what Andy is watching, then run back to his own room and watch the same thing.

He said instead that he was going to &quot;use this time before Glen comes over to catch up on some reading.&quot; What he usually tapes and watches are G4 Tech TV, anime, Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and the SciFi channel. He&#39;ll also watch various movies that we recommend or of his own choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCasey is 11. She&#39;s been playing with a friend all afternoon so she&#39;s just now turning the TV on even though they could have watched all day. Her friend just left and Casey is watching Nicktoons. Her favorites lately are Gilmore Girls, Survivor, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, the Simpsons and Malcom in the Middle. She doesn&#39;t like stuff with overt sex or violence in it and self limits or asks us to warn her when something is coming she won&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s two kids with unlimited access to the TV. It&#39;s 4:20 pm on a Saturday. One kid chose reading over TV and the other chose to play with a friend all day only turning on a cartoon in the late afternoon. <br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary, unschooling mom to Conor (16) and Casey (11)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just today I&#39;m going to be utterly present for my children, I&#39;m going to be in their world (not just doing my own thing while they do theirs), I&#39;m going to really hear them, I&#39;m going to prepare myself to be present starting right now.&quot;<br/>\n                            ~Ren Allen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9243,"nextTopicId":9431}}
