I feel a great deal of clarity and I think to day when Lukas goes to the computer I am going to spend some time with him.  In fact I will do a little of this every day.  Your message about interests is especially provocative.  I see some of this with my oldest Kora(10).  She let go of sports she loved, piano lessons, reading and drawing.   It seems we cannot underestimate the depth of what school really does to some kids.  I think it is amazing how school takes away our ability to make decisions for ourselves and puts so many in the position of conformity for the sake of survival.  So here are our children after only a few short years left to make some decisions on their own.  Trying to find themselves so to speak....luckily they get to do it now rather than in their 30&#39;s.

You are right about the value judgement part....It is truely amazing how as adults we can decide what is right or wrong for children and not really give them much time to show us what they are learning from the things we steer them away from.  Today, Lukas was able to name several types of cars and describe some their features.  He said he got it from playing a racing car game on the computer.  Then he launched into a discussion about graphics and talking about how some games have better graphics than others and why he thinks certain graphics are better.  I was truly amazed and even though I had a little bit of a panic stirring because of how long he was on the computer I was able to listen carefully to the learning......Again thank you so much for your words of wisdom.

I remember feeling <br/>\nsad also about my son turning away from other interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing is that I realized that I was making a value judgment that <br/>\nthose other interests were more valuable than time spent doing things on <br/>\nthe computer. They are all things that kids are choosing to do for their <br/>\nown reasons and they are enjoying and learning all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that if you pay attention to what he is doing on the <br/>\ncomputer you may start to see that many things are happening. My kids do <br/>\na lot of different things on the computer- they socialize, play magic(a <br/>\ngame that is described as being more challenging than chess), read, <br/>\nwrite, research, learn how to make jewelry, find music to play along <br/>\nwith, and that is just a start.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can offer other things - think of places to go and things to do that <br/>\nyou think he might be interested in, bring in games, books, and toys and <br/>\noffer them without expectation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the last thing is that my son did return to those other interests! <br/>\nMy daughter does many other things as well- they all seem to blend <br/>\ntogether. She learned to write mainly through email. She will draw and <br/>\nmake jewelry while watching TV shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can just sit and feel your feelings and separate that from what <br/>\nis truly going on, that can really help. I have been there and have gone <br/>\nthrough all those feelings of being unsure and worrying that I was <br/>\nruining my kids. They are not ruined! Absolutely the opposite!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that is helpful- it is not so long ago that we took the final steps <br/>\nand it has been absolutely worth it in terms of improved relationships <br/>\nand with no ill effect to learning- they learn always.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\nDonna Vanderlip wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Keep benifiting from the support I find here as we continue the <br/>\n&gt; deschooling process.
