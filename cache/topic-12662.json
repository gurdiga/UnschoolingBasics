I felt alot of the same stuff <br/>\nabout about my daughter...not a leader, would watch tv for hours on <br/>\nend, only child so no one to play with... just lots of stuff. But in <br/>\nthe almost month we&#39;ve been just living and not worrying <br/>\nabout &quot;school&quot; I&#39;ve seen her blossom and flourish! I realized that if <br/>\nI would just leave her the heck alone and be a resource for her and <br/>\nquit trying to &quot;teach&quot; her, she opens my eyes to her own intelligence! <br/>\nI read in a book somewhere... either John Holt or Grace Llewellyn...if <br/>\nanyone recognizes this let me know so I give proper credit... that <br/>\nthere is no true teaching, only learning. I love that! It also says <br/>\nthat a teacher is only there to facilitate learning. You can &quot;teach&quot; <br/>\nall you want but if no real learning (not just to pass the test and <br/>\nforget but REAL learning)is happening it&#39;s no good. Anyway, just some <br/>\nthoughts!
