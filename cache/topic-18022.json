We looked into it, talked about it and <br/>\nwe came to the conclusion that they&#39;re rather expensive. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, my husband said he would look into a pay-as-you-go phone and also <br/>\nhow much it would be to add her on our plan. Before he had a chance to <br/>\ndo that, I came up with an idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never use my cell phone on the weekends because my husband is usually <br/>\nthe only one that calls me, and he&#39;s home on Saturday & Sunday. So, I <br/>\nthought to give her my phone on the weekends. It won&#39;t cost her <br/>\nanything that way and it won&#39;t cost us any extra money either because <br/>\nwe have free weekends. She gets the phone on Friday night and she gives <br/>\nit back to me Sunday, before she goes to bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe bought herself the cutest phone case, added in her friends phone <br/>\nnumbers and she&#39;s all set. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I think is really cute is the person she calls the MOST is me and <br/>\nmy mother. She calls me from the backyard all the time. LOL! My mother <br/>\nlives next door but Shawna is always calling her to see if she needs <br/>\nanything. :-) <br/>\nOf course, she can use the phone during the week also but she likes <br/>\nthat it&#39;s ALL HER&#39;S on the weekend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the pay-as-you-go phones...my mom just bought a Virgin Mobile <br/>\nand likes it. You buy minutes over the phone but that&#39;s all I know <br/>\nabout it. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (8), Shawna (11) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 2003<br/>\n************************************<br/>\nUnschooling Voices ~ Add Your Voice<br/>\nwww.foreverparents.com/UnschoolingVoices.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jlh44music&quot; &lt;jlh44music@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone has had good experiences with pay-as-you-go <br/>\n&gt; cell phones.

We were paying over $90 a month for unused time,<br/>\nbut we were locked into a contract, and had to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are using t-mobile to go.  I like it, it&#39;s much<br/>\nmore affordable, and you don&#39;t get charged for time<br/>\nyou aren&#39;t using.  We bought a phone from Costco, to<br/>\ntry it, and ended up buying another one, so that I and<br/>\nmy hubby can both use them.  We bought 1,000 minutes<br/>\nfor my phone, which is good for a year.  You only need<br/>\nto buy more minutes when your time is getting low. <br/>\nWith the tracphone, you have to keep adding units,<br/>\nwhether you have used them all or not.  We&#39;ve done<br/>\nalot of researching, and some of the pay as you go<br/>\nphones, charge you minutes/units just to turn on the<br/>\nphone--t-mobile doesn&#39;t.  I hope this helps.  I know<br/>\nthat Target sells the phones, with minutes included in<br/>\nthe package.
