I was <br/>\nsort of thinking out loud and wondering about not giving so much <br/>\nnegative attention to older sib when he does something wrong and <br/>\nfocus more on when he gets something right.  It is hard to get away <br/>\nfrom labels and I have read so many books on dealing with special <br/>\nneeds.  He has been diagnosed Aspergers, Tourette&#39;s, PDD-NOS, ADHD; <br/>\nit makes my head spin.  Basically, he has an autistic trait of <br/>\nhandflapping while jumping up and down and making loud animal <br/>\nnoises.  The doctors don&#39;t really know what box he fits in.  He does <br/>\nthe handflapping alot and this particular behavior is discussed <br/>\nextensively in Sensory Integration Disorder books as well.  However, <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s not doing this behavior, he is articulate, normal eye <br/>\ncontact and mannerisms.  His peers don&#39;t realize anything until they <br/>\nspot him in another room handflapping and jumping in a corner.  He <br/>\nhas gotten better control of this behavior around his peers as he&#39;s <br/>\ngotten older.  But he doesn&#39;t try to control it with family members <br/>\nso he does it alot at home.  Anyway, I just wanted to explain a bit <br/>\nabout my son.  I also try to forget the labels and figure out how <br/>\nbest to make him happy and not stressed (he gets stressed very <br/>\neasily).  I am doing some biomedical interventions and it is time-<br/>\nconsuming.  I try to be there for my boys, but I can&#39;t always be <br/>\nthere 24/7.  The only way is if I made them follow me up and down <br/>\ndifferent levels of the house.  My bedroom is upstairs and the <br/>\nbasement has exercise equipment and I try to do a short work-out <br/>\nbecause it helps me mentally.  They don&#39;t want to exercise and they <br/>\ndon&#39;t ever want to take a walk.  They usually just want to sit in the <br/>\nliving room and watch TV and there are times when I need to be on a <br/>\ndifferent level of the house.  The computer is upstairs in the office <br/>\nas well.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I want you to know I do appreciate your advice and I have learned <br/>\nmuch from you.  I was wondering if I could ask you something on a <br/>\ndifferent topic.  My older son has chosen to take several classes at <br/>\nthe Jr. High this year.  I think the main reason was because he loves <br/>\nthe Ned Declassified tv show about junior high and he wanted to give <br/>\nit a try.  Now he is telling me that he hates the computer class he <br/>\nis taking.  He says it is boring.  I have seen the hand-outs and I <br/>\nwholeheartedly agree.  He also says he can&#39;t seem to listen to the <br/>\nteacher.  He told me this morning, &quot;I think it&#39;s my Asperger&#39;s mom, <br/>\nbecause I have this block and I can&#39;t follow what he is saying&quot;.  He <br/>\nstruggles alot with attention and much of his energy is just focusing <br/>\non not flapping and sitting still in the desk.  There is an <br/>\nAsperger&#39;s book called &quot;Pretending to be Normal&quot;, and that is the <br/>\nstory of Mark&#39;s life.  He wants to be &quot;normal&quot; and fit in and be <br/>\npopular and even have a girlfriend.  Anyway, I digress again, sorry.  <br/>\nI told him that he can choose to quit the class, but the school has <br/>\ntold me that he will receive an F.  He is enjoying the PE class <br/>\nthere.  Is it a big deal that he gets an F?  He asked me what it <br/>\nmeans to get an F.  I think he will probably continue taking various <br/>\nclasses at the school, but am not sure how good it will be to be <br/>\ndropping some of them and getting Fs.  I was wondering what your <br/>\nthoughts were.  At this point, he says he wants to go to college and <br/>\nI wonder if some Fs would affect his being able to go to the school <br/>\nhe wanted.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Beth  <br/>\n<br/>\n-- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt;  From: mouser4@... remember now quite a few years ago <br/>\n&gt; reading about extinction to<br/>\n&gt; lessen undesired behaviors.

At the time my eldest was going thought it, I pretty<br/>\nmuch went though it alone. Been divorced  since my eldest was five at<br/>\nthe time. Personally I don&#39;t call it rivalry, I call it the little<br/>\nbull syndrome. I don&#39;t know if you know much about cattle, and being<br/>\nraise with animals I remember watching the same behavior with the<br/>\nyoung bulls. If you ever watch little bulls bunting their heads<br/>\ntogether and driving the other back. This is to deter mend the <br/>\npecking order. when my eldest is beginning to get the hormones he was<br/>\nangry and the tears would flow(the poor kid). He didn&#39;t realize what<br/>\nis going on with himself. I would send him into his room and calm the<br/>\nother boys. I had three of them and it is really hard for them all.<br/>\nThe younger ones didn&#39;t understand either. Then when everything was<br/>\ncalm i would go and talk to the eldest by himself. I would ask him<br/>\nwhat going on and they will go though the blame game. But in time you<br/>\nwill get to the problem. I really got good at reading his body for<br/>\nstress. In time with working with him and the others I got them to say<br/>\n&quot;I need to talk to you&quot;. <br/>\n\tYes I have read books on rivalry and different issue on raising<br/>\nchildren. Then in the end I went with what felt right when working<br/>\nwith my boys. I never really punish the boys by making them write or<br/>\nto sit in the corner till they come down. When i did try to put them<br/>\nin the corner i would give them a book such as the Britannica. Then<br/>\nthe boys would ask me questions about things in the book and before <br/>\nyou knew it, i was in time out having a great time with the boys<br/>\nlooking at the books. All this pretty much told me, was that i wasn&#39;t<br/>\ngiving the boy what they needed.<br/>\n\tThen my second you was creeping into the age but he would take the<br/>\nnext step up to grabbing any thing that was handy to give a good<br/>\nwallop to the boy that was bothering him. So hammers and any thing<br/>\nthat could do real damage was moved doing his cycle. He was a very<br/>\nangry boy. When the two eldest would start hitting each other I would<br/>\nstep out of the way or tell them to take it out side. Either way they<br/>\nwould come back to earth and I would ask them if it was fun? That<br/>\nwould startle them. Both of them would say &quot;no&quot; and I would ask if it<br/>\n&quot;was worth it?&quot; then they would shake their heads and admit that it<br/>\nwas stupid.<br/>\n\t Third son well he is different to he turned into a hermit. He<br/>\nwatched what was going through with his elder brothers. He didn&#39;t give<br/>\ninto the emotional conflict. He was in the school system and refused<br/>\nto do home work. He stayed back one year and they same crap was going<br/>\non the second year and i pulled him. This boy would skip school and go<br/>\nto the local library to read <br/>\n\tToday I&#39;m happy to admit that most of the spats are gone maybe we<br/>\nhave one or two in a year. I truly I believe it is bases on<br/>\ncommunication. I want my boys to argue with me this is how they learn<br/>\nto debate and too have their own voice.  If they can hold their own<br/>\nwith you, they can hold their own with others. If they know that they<br/>\nhave a strong un-abusive way to express them selves   the fist will be<br/>\nleft behind.  The key is to stay calm. If you lose control of yourself<br/>\nyou will be losing the effect. Then again this is what worked for me.<br/>\nAnd people always told me that I don&#39;t think like the normal person.<br/>\nRe member we have our children for only a short time.

My boys were playing the Playstation II very nicely <br/>\ntogether.  I received a phone call and went upstairs to my bedroom to <br/>\nget some information.  When I came back down within 5 minutes, my <br/>\nolder son was laying on top of his younger brother holding him down <br/>\nin a tight grip and looking very angry.  I told him to get off his <br/>\nbrother and he said &quot;no&quot; and that his younger brother would attack <br/>\nhim.  I said that he wouldn&#39;t and neither of them should hurt each <br/>\nother and repeated for him to get off of him.  He did get up and my <br/>\nyounger son didn&#39;t do anything--just continued lying on the ground.  <br/>\nBut my older son pushed on him hard as he got up and then kicked him <br/>\nonce he stood up before he walked away.  I said that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve he just did that and he said that his younger brother had <br/>\nattacked him earlier.  My younger son replied that he attacked him <br/>\nbecause he was saying very mean things and couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  <br/>\nMy younger son wants me to punish older bro for kicking him, <br/>\nespecially since I was standing right there and told them not to hurt <br/>\neach other.  I am not sure what to do if I can&#39;t use punishment. I <br/>\nposted about this earlier and it was suggested that I watch them <br/>\ncloser.  I have been doing this, but I can&#39;t watch them every second. <br/>\nWe have a 3-story house. In the past, I have punished both boys for <br/>\nhitting by having them write 10 sentences or doing something nice for <br/>\nother brother as retribution.  Now I try to talk to them about how <br/>\nit&#39;s not okay to hurt people and that if they behave this way as <br/>\nadults, they will be punished or in jail.  I don&#39;t want my older son <br/>\nthinking he can get away with hurting his little brother whenever he <br/>\nis annoyed.  He acts like a bully at times.  I have been poring over <br/>\nbooks trying to find answers, but haven&#39;t found a whole lot.  Sibling <br/>\nRivalry says to give attention to the victim and ignore the <br/>\naggressor.  It also says to make a comment like &quot;hit a pillow when <br/>\nyour angry not your brother&quot;.  I do try to be there to intervene, but <br/>\nnow that my older son realizes he is not going to be punished, he is <br/>\nblatantly pushing, hitting, and kicking younger brother even when I <br/>\nam standing right there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be appreciated.  Thanks,<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18352,"nextTopicId":18328}}
