I am<br/>\nbecoming less and less surprised that I am ending up where I am as a mother.<br/>\n It started with breastfeeding and has evolved into unschooling.  These last<br/>\nfew weeks, I have truly come into the realization that unschooling is just<br/>\nthe next step in a process that began with a goal that I had before I had my<br/>\nchildren.  I decided that my goal as a parent would be to raise children who<br/>\nfelt good about themselves, who had high self-esteem.  This has to do with<br/>\nthe fact that I have struggled with having high self-esteem.  Little did I<br/>\nknow where this would lead me because at every turn, I have to work on who I<br/>\nam in order to parent in a way that allows my children the freedom to be who<br/>\nthey are.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a beautiful thing to be able to leave our children material wealth,<br/>\nbut nothing compares to the love.  I once remember an alcohol and drug<br/>\ncounselor saying that he had NEVER treated a patient for alcohol and drug<br/>\naddiction who said that they were addicts because their parents did not buy<br/>\nthem enough stuff.  It is the lack of love that had them there.  It is<br/>\ncomments like those that keep me determined to continue to open myself more<br/>\nto my children, husband and people in general.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey may not remember our name, but they will have our love.......There is<br/>\nno greater legacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8349,"nextTopicId":8362}}
