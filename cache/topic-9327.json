This topic rolls around every so often, we bust a<br/>\nfew myths and VOILA! another family starts to see the &quot;effects&quot; of tv,<br/>\nwere really more about control than the television itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good fodder for discussion. It sharpens our thinking skills,<br/>\nhelps us debate whether or not the common assumptions about television<br/>\nare correct and  helps more people than just the ones in the discussion. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t feel badly for bringing up a very interesting and highly<br/>\ndiscussed topic.  I used to feel just like you and now tv has no power<br/>\nin our lives, it&#39;s just another tool for learning...like everything in<br/>\nthe world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a tough shift to make, but when a parent gives a television power<br/>\n(by thinking it&#39;s &quot;addicting&quot; or youth can&#39;t use critical thinking<br/>\nskills to see past advertising) then it does have power.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, my children have asked for things on television, but that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t make the thing bad, just because the company advertised does it?<br/>\nWe have lots of good conversation about manipulation in advertising<br/>\nand how to research consumer reports and such.  My dd still wants to<br/>\nbuy the Floam after reading the reviews here (and knowing it won&#39;t act<br/>\nlike the ads make it sound, and that it might stink etc..) and it will<br/>\nbe a wonderful learning experience for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking poor choices, leads to better choices. So it&#39;s ok if they want<br/>\nthings that don&#39;t meet their expectations. It&#39;s ok for us, it&#39;s ok for<br/>\nthem. More often than not, it leads to a bunch of research on the<br/>\ninternet to see if the ad is midleading or if there&#39;s a similar<br/>\nproduct that&#39;s better!<br/>\n<br/>\nBack when novels first came out, people were very negative about the<br/>\n&quot;effects&quot; of reading such trash. Every new form of communication seems<br/>\nto scare the older generation. Eventually it becomes accepted, then<br/>\nmaybe even revered (look how we worship reading books and villify<br/>\ntv)...so it&#39;s all part of history. We&#39;re on the curve of teleision<br/>\nbeing relatively new in history, and people are just beginning to show<br/>\nstudies that are positive. We&#39;ll get there.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9295,"nextTopicId":9330}}
