He went to a private<br/>\nschool from gr. 1 through 6.  I guess I&#39;m not sure I could<br/>\nunschool him.

Finding other unschoolers to hang iwth would help a LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly just let him heal right now. The scars from school are still <br/>\nfresh and painful.

He may feel &quot;less than&quot; for a <br/>\nwhile because he&#39;s not cramming Shakespeare and algebra like his <br/>\nschooled friends, but his love of learning will return in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust.

Solutions of this kind <br/>\nare going to be unique to families, to some extent, but its worth <br/>\nconsidering what kinds of resources you may be able to call on, <br/>\nincluding human resources. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think most of the pressure I feel is self generated....he<br/>\n&gt; is pretty happy left alone alot and likes to do video games<br/>\n&gt; but I try to interest him in other things to get some balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Balance isn&#39;t necessarily something he needs. That may be a <br/>\nsurprising statement, but this idea of &quot;the well rounded child&quot; is <br/>\njust an idea. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with the <br/>\nreal needs of real individual kids. If he *needed* to be doing a <br/>\ndozen different things, he&#39;d be asking for that in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts really hard to say how things would look if he wasn&#39;t in school <br/>\nbecause there&#39;s so much of his thinking and behavior tied up in <br/>\nschool right now. When he&#39;s home he&#39;s home From School. When he&#39;s on <br/>\nvacation, its From School. So school and his feelings about school <br/>\nand reactions to school are coloring everything he does. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I seem to need a LOT of time alone, and he and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t like to do the same things (which isn&#39;t wrong or that<br/>\n&gt; unusual but it makes it harder).  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It does make it harder - how hard are you willing to work for the <br/>\nsake of your relationship with your son? That&#39;s not meant to be <br/>\neither rhetorical or snarky, its something to think about really <br/>\nhard. There&#39;s a big cultural expectation that our primary job as <br/>\nparents is to prepare kids for life - and their happiness will, <br/>\npresumably take care of itself along the way. Unschooling comes from <br/>\nthe perspective that our job is to build a partnership with our <br/>\nkids - and part of that is helping our partners be happy in their <br/>\nlives right now. That&#39;s a pretty big shift in expectations, and <br/>\ntakes a lot of internal work on the part of the parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t share a lot of interests with my stepson, so I have to work <br/>\nharder to connect with him, to find out about him, to understand his <br/>\nlikes and dislikes and passions. He&#39;s still pretty baffling to me <br/>\nsometimes, and I still worry that I&#39;m not really doing &quot;enough&quot;.
