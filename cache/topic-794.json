It&#39;s in our nature to<br/>\ntake care of our offspring and we shouldn&#39;t waste time feeling guilty about<br/>\ntaking some attention away from animals.<br/>\n     Now I am a mom of 4 and I can tell you without a doubt that I love<br/>\nevery single one of my children with more passion than I could have ever<br/>\nmustered for my beloved cat.  When the second child is born you realize how<br/>\nmuch your heart can open up and love more than you ever thought possible.<br/>\nFor me it just happened over and over again.<br/>\n    I guess my point is:  Animals are animals(sorry to all you pet lovers<br/>\nout there) and they are not and never will be offspring.  You can&#39;t and<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t compare the loss of love you felt for your pet to what it might<br/>\nfeel like to have a second child. I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t love my cat, I&#39;m<br/>\njust saying that something instinctual takes over and doesn&#39;t allow you to<br/>\nlove anything more than your children.<br/>\n   If your exhausted or stressed out or barely hanging on to your sanity;<br/>\nthose are all good reasons not to have another, but this whole can&#39;t love<br/>\nthem equally thing is not even an issue in my book, and it shouldn&#39;t worry<br/>\nyou so much either<br/>\n   Good luck,<br/>\n   AnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Sherri-Lee Pressman [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:s-lp@...\">s-lp@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 18, 2004 12:41 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 39<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Millie,<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am fairly new here too and not a seasoned unschooler like many here, but<br/>\nI wanted to say, I can totally relate to your concern about being able to<br/>\nlove another child without it meaning you love the first less.
