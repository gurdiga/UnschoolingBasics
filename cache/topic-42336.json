It really took me a good 8 months to fully de-school.  In fact, the final moment (if there really is one) was when my daughter came home from her first day of middle school (yes, after 6 months of un-schooling and a couple of months of summer, she really wanted to try middle school, after all, it looks so fun on TV and all of her elementary school friends were there).  Anyway, my daughter came home on the bus and told me that she spent the last three periods of the day in the nurses office.  The bells ringing at their randomly scheduled times gave her a headache.  She was not going back, she informed me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThree months later she is happily producing videos again and posting them on youtube, gathering quite a collection of supporters there.  She is also reading tons on the internet.  Doing all kinds of research for her video projects.  Strategizing on how to acquire the camera of her dreams (budgets, fundraising...)  She is going to Cotillion (a monthly dance for kids her age) where she sees her old friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHer brother enjoys endless hours on video games and a much smaller world, which is perfect for his recovery (5 open heart surgeries, 6 other heart surgeries, and numerous stays in the hospital during his first five years - all of this requires a little more than public school or even regular homeschooling can provide).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I have gone back to work.  Hubby&#39;s business is not working out and I found a fabulous job.  Every day I trust my instinct, that little voice that points me in the right direction.  And, that voice ALWAYS steers me right.  That voice is also getting louder than the fear voice and more distinct from the &quot;what if&quot; voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man who was concerned about my decision to homeschool and then to un-school, is now bonding with his son and being challenged by his daughter to get more involved with her.  We are learning all kinds of things about relating to each other and others.  Life is so good and juicy for us now. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling was one of my most brilliant choices!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers to you for shelving the books, focusing on yourself, and allowing your kids to find their pathway through life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221315529,"authorName":"Ronnie","from":"&quot;Ronnie&quot; &lt;hmsdragonfly@...&gt;","profile":"hmsdragonfly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Deschooling is hard to do...","postDate":"1259954487","msgId":42341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmYm5mbis2NGp1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhmYjI3dSszamdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42336,"nextInTopic":42344,"prevInTime":42340,"nextInTime":42342,"topicId":42336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Dorla, I am SO excited for you and your family.

You have so many wonderful discoveries ahead! And you have lost *nothing*, I promise, except perhaps a specific routine. The connections you enjoyed previously will continue (and probably increase in both frequency and connectedness), and the resources you enjoyed are still available should the mood come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we pulled our kids out of school, we went out for ice cream--our traditional end-of-the-school-year celebration--even though it was January. It was a great way to shift the nervousness we were feeling into anticipation and excitement. Create a celebration of your own! <br/>\n<br/>\nRonnie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/\">http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Dorla A&quot; &lt;dorla@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m new here and learning so much from each post.<br/>\n&gt; I go through fear, anger, resentment, joy and contentment everyday as I embark on this unschooling path.<br/>\n&gt; The other day I decided to clear out the school room - taking out all of our school books and reassigning them a place in our little library in the sunroom.

I have been trying to deschool now for several months and it is the hardest thing I have ever done. I am constantly worrying about everything(mostly the future highschool years). I wonder how we&#39;ll get into a college and I worry about my kids not knowing any higher math how to write an essay ect.. ect..! I fully feel this is right but yet I am having the hardest time putting it into action. I get the feeling that maybe I am not smart enough to unschool my kids! I am not the most creative person and I feel like I might have them missing something. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways I hope all goes well for you. I have really enjoyed reading all the great answers and questions on here. <br/>\n <br/>\nHugs,   Kerry~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Dorla A &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dorla@...\">dorla@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Fri, December 4, 2009 7:18:54 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Deschooling is hard to do...<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nI&#39;m new here and learning so much from each post.<br/>\nI go through fear, anger, resentment, joy and contentment everyday as I embark on this unschooling path.<br/>\nThe other day I decided to clear out the school room - taking out all of our school books and reassigning them a place in our little library in the sunroom.
