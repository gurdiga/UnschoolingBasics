I&#39;ll do<br/>\nthat today.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a an article from ATTACh about this practice (the entire text is<br/>\nhere: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf\">http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of this document is to set guidelines and standards for<br/>\nethically and clinically appropriate treatment for children with attachment<br/>\nproblems. This document is intended to provide guidance to parents and<br/>\ntherapists so that they avoid the use of coercive techniques. ATTACh<br/>\nbelieves a<br/>\ncentral focus of treatment for children with attachment problems is to<br/>\ncreate an<br/>\nenvironment in which the individual can safely work to integrate previously<br/>\nunmanageable information and emotions related to early traumatic experiences<br/>\nwith caregivers. Those post-traumatic emotional reactions interfere with the<br/>\ndevelopment of healthy relationships and may have serious negative effects<br/>\non a<br/>\nchild&#39;s overall development.<br/>\n<br/>\n*********<br/>\nOK so that&#39;s the focus...here is a brief description of what they are<br/>\ntalking about...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important at the outset to clarify that a coercive treatment approach<br/>\nis separate and<br/>\ndistinct from the occasional and judicious use of strategies such as logical<br/>\nand reasonable<br/>\nconsequences, safety interventions, enforcement of limits and other<br/>\nlegitimate interventions in<br/>\nthe socialization of and provision of safety for children. Though these can<br/>\nbe defined as<br/>\n&quot;coercive,&quot; they are not typically accompanied by fear and are a legitimate<br/>\npart of a parenting<br/>\ntoolbox for parents of all children. When used in the context of a loving<br/>\nparent child relationship,<br/>\nthe occasional and judicious use of such techniques is a constructive<br/>\nintervention of parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarmful and threatening forms of coercion have previously been used in<br/>\ntreatment with<br/>\nchildren. Some of these practices were done in the name of attachment<br/>\ntherapy. Examples<br/>\ninclude wrapping children in blankets and not allowing them to leave; poking<br/>\nchildren during<br/>\ntherapy and strongly encouraging (even demanding) them to express anger at<br/>\nprevious abusers;<br/>\nadults lying on children; and therapists forcing a child to carry out<br/>\nexplicit instructions for<br/>\nbehavior (e.g., sitting in a specific manner) as dictated by the therapist<br/>\nor risk serious<br/>\nconsequences. These practices, and similar ones, fall in an area that is<br/>\nclearly coercive. We<br/>\nbelieve that the use of this type of coercion is not appropriate in<br/>\ntreatment for children.<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\nFurther...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, ATTACh supports<br/>\nrecommendations in the 2006 Report of the APSAC Task Force on Attachment<br/>\nTherapy,<br/>\nReactive Attachment Disorder, and Attachment Problems. (Chaffin et al.,<br/>\n2006) Specifically, we<br/>\nagree with following recommendation:<br/>\n�techniques involving physical coercion, psychologically or physically<br/>\nenforced holding, physical restraint, physical domination, provoked<br/>\ncatharsis,<br/>\nventilation of rage, age regression, humiliation, withholding or forcing<br/>\nfood or<br/>\nwater intake, prolonged social isolation, or assuming exaggerated levels of<br/>\ncontrol<br/>\nand domination over a child are contraindicated�.&quot; (Chaffin et al., 2006, p.<br/>\n86)<br/>\nEach of these statements condemns the use of coercion in treatment. However,<br/>\nnone<br/>\ngives guidance about what distinguishes coercive interventions from<br/>\nacceptable authoritative<br/>\npractices. It is easy to distinguish between the extremes. However, a wide<br/>\ncontinuum exists<br/>\nbetween the endpoints. This is the area in which parents and therapists have<br/>\nstruggled to find<br/>\ninterventions that effectively address the population of children who have<br/>\nexperienced early life<br/>\nmaltreatment and their current challenging behaviors. ATTACh believes it is<br/>\nimportant to give<br/>\nusable guidance to those courageous enough to work with these children, even<br/>\nif giving such<br/>\nguidance is fraught with difficulties.<br/>\nThe therapeutic use of confrontation and directive therapeutic techniques is<br/>\nwidely<br/>\nviewed as appropriate and beneficial when appropriately applied (Hammond,<br/>\nHepworth, &<br/>\nSmith, 2002). The phrase &quot;confrontation&quot; is used in therapeutic literature<br/>\nas a technique to help<br/>\nthe clients resolve maladaptive defenses. ATTACh believes the proper use of<br/>\ntherapeutic<br/>\nconfrontation and other directive techniques may be beneficial but must be<br/>\ndone in a<br/>\nmanner that promotes attunement, sensitivity, and developmental<br/>\nappropriateness.<br/>\n************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOK it&#39;s a long paper and there is more.  Specifically what I&#39;d like to see<br/>\nfrom the RU perspective are feelings about this treatment and if you have<br/>\nany real stories of RAD and treatment for it from an RU perspective that<br/>\nwould be perfect.  I want to contend that it&#39;s possible to treat a child<br/>\nwith RAD with dignity and respect and still foster an attachment, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if I&#39;m right.  My daughter has attachment issues but not severe<br/>\nones.  Am I wrong about seriously disordered children?  Can RU work there<br/>\ntoo?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your help,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36611,"nextTopicId":36439}}
