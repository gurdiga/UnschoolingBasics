Is he<br/>\nthe type of child who will sneak away to find things that interest him<br/>\nor did he have enough free time without things to do that he created a<br/>\ngame?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt three, my son had too much time with grandma watching him one day<br/>\nand he used the blue stamp pad as a body paint.  He looked like a<br/>\nsmurf for a few days.  Kids will do wacky things that you would never<br/>\nanticipate if you give them the time and supplies.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s bored or just very curious or probably both.  I<br/>\ntry not to react with anger but I&#39;m often so frustrated with him and<br/>\nthe huge mess I need to clean up...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 5 years old, I found that my kids wanted my interaction much more<br/>\nthan at 3 or 4 years old.  But it was different.  They needed me to<br/>\nplay their games, not play mine.  Let him lead.  Follow his direction.<br/>\n Let him explore his games and use your foresight to redirect the game<br/>\nto a less messy clean-up zone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes he have a place to make a mess?  At 5, my son was making mud<br/>\npatches in my backyard to bath in and covering himself from head to<br/>\ntoe.  Grass can regrow, the memories are priceless.  Take pictures of<br/>\nthe wacky moments.  You&#39;ll laugh later.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...I spend tons of time with him but it never seems to be enough...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying your games or his??  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs he learning to explore by his rules or are you supplying him with<br/>\nall the information?  He will learn to be more thoughtful of his<br/>\nsurroundings and possessions if he&#39;s given the freedom to explore his<br/>\nimpulses (with guidance when necessary).  Be present.  Be observant. <br/>\nBe excited to follow his lead. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have three kids and this year, I&#39;m on my own, as my dh is in<br/>\nIraq...which could also be another reason he is acting out...daddy&#39;s<br/>\ngone.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry to hear that you are parenting alone, but it happens all<br/>\nover the world everyday.

(And, I&#39;m not saying <br/>\nthat you would say &quot;no&quot;; I&#39;m really asking.)  What if he *knew* that <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t say no but instead would help him find a way to explore <br/>\nthe thing he wants to explore but in a what that was okay with <br/>\nyou.  For example, instead of saying &quot;no, you can&#39;t play with the <br/>\nmatches,&quot; saying, &quot;yes, let&#39;s go outside and do some fire experiments <br/>\ntogether!&quot; or &quot;yes, let&#39;s spread this paper out and dump the paint <br/>\nand see what happens.&quot;  He sounds wonderfully creative and <br/>\nbrilliant!  It just sounds like he needs you to help him find the <br/>\nanswers to these questions in a more acceptable way.  (You might want <br/>\nto consider getting newsprint end rolls (the ends of rolls of <br/>\nnewsprint that are usually discarded) so you can have endless paper <br/>\navailable to him.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it sounds like it could be hard to do, but if you can shift <br/>\nyour focus from the mess he&#39;s creating and the clean up to helping <br/>\nhim explore and know the amazing benefits from supporting his <br/>\nexplorations, you&#39;ll feel less resistance and so will he.  He&#39;ll also <br/>\nbe able to be more open with you about the things he wants to do.  If <br/>\nyou&#39;re more fun to do them with, he&#39;ll be more liable to include you in them.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 09:17 6/29/2008, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m struggling with how to deal with my 5yo son right now and am hoping<br/>\n&gt;for some advice.

Are you off cleaning or doing some other task while this is<br/>\nhappening?  Make sure he has something he&#39;s really into doing if you need a<br/>\nsecond to do something.
