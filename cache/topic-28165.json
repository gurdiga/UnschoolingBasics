About 20% of the dry weight of the brain and some<br/>\n30% of the retina are made from these elements.&quot; Learn more...<br/>\n<br/>\nEnzyme Supplementation: Many SIDKids exhibit digestive difficulties, which<br/>\nmay be aided by the use of enzyme therapy. Enzymes help break down food<br/>\nproteins, carbohydrates, and lipids and can increase the breakdown of all<br/>\nfood proteins, carbohydrates, starches, and fats. Enzyme advocates postulate<br/>\nthat the supplementation of enzymes can eliminate the need to avoid<br/>\ncasein/gluten-based foods altogether. In fact. there are now enzymes<br/>\nspecifically designed to aid in the digestion of gluten and casein from<br/>\ncompanies such as Kirkman Labs. Learn more...<br/>\n<br/>\nFeingold Diet: According to the Feingold Association of the United States,<br/>\n&quot;The Feingold Program itself is a test to determine if certain foods or food<br/>\nadditives are triggering particular symptoms. It is basically the way people<br/>\nused to eat before &quot;hyperactivity&quot; became a household word, and before<br/>\nasthma and chronic ear infections became so very common. Used originally as<br/>\na diet for allergies, improvement in behavior and attention was first<br/>\nnoticed as a &quot;side effect.&quot; Learn more...<br/>\n<br/>\nGluten-free/Casein-free Diet: This approach involves the total elimination<br/>\nof all foods containing gluten and casein. While designed for the autistic<br/>\nchild, many families have found great improvements for their non-autistic<br/>\nSIDKids. And fortunately, many gluten-free and casein-free foods are now<br/>\ncommercially available.

I also have a son, who can easily be described as more. What I have come to realize is me being connected to him is his greatest source of control. He and I work together in partnership. Also, my guy goes through cycles and about every 6 months he completely disintegrates for awhile and then it seems he copes again. During these super rough times, I simply life, cut out social situations that are putting him over, and reconnect as best as I can. If my guy were in a play, I would be right there the entire rehersal, so he can check in and be near me, bounce holding my hands, dance with me in open space as needed. Is it possible for you to be available to him. My guy travels with his swim team and I go, no matter what. He lost it once in a very crowded airport far from home, was teased, was hot, was uncomfortable, was tired, was asked to wait. I just cringe thinking how he would have been if I wasn&#39;t available to help him move away, fi<br/>\nnd fresh air and a more quiet place. My son and I have singnals, a guick lets go, means, no matter what, he needs space from the crowd or else. We check in, he vents, we move forward. Water, fresh air and space are his greatest comforts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 children, my son is my middle child. It does take more energy to be his center, but the alternative is everyone near suffers when he suffers. It&#39;s second nature now, to be his partner and I see he is able to cope better each year.

We&#39;ve found the issue with junk<br/>\nfood is best handled in the supermarket -- not in the home once it is there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiet can have a huge impact on behavior. Of course, so can genetics and<br/>\nenvironment. But diet is often easier to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a sample link:<br/>\nhttp://www.cspinet. &lt;http://www.cspinet.org/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html&gt;<br/>\norg/nah/3_00/diet_behavior.html<br/>\n&quot;The idea that food can affect children&#39;s behavior gained popularity in the<br/>\nearly 1970s, when California allergist Benjamin Feingold claimed that the<br/>\nbehavior of many of his young patients improved when he placed them on<br/>\nspecial diets to treat their food allergies. Feingold blamed food<br/>\nadditives-especially food dyes-as well as salicylates, which are chemicals<br/>\nthat occur naturally in most fruits. ... &quot;Some of these studies<br/>\ndemonstrated significant improvement in the behavior of children when their<br/>\ndiets were changed, or deterioration in their behavior when they were given<br/>\nfood dyes or other offending foods,&quot; says Eugene Arnold, professor emeritus<br/>\nof psychiatry at Ohio State University. But in other studies, the<br/>\nimprovements were small, and in a few there were none. ... In some of the<br/>\nnine studies on children with typical ADHD, the behavior of kids who were<br/>\nput on an additive-free diet returned to normal (as rated by their parents<br/>\nor teachers). But don&#39;t expect miracles. &quot;Parents who are looking for a<br/>\nmagic bullet may be frustrated,&quot; says researcher Bonnie Kaplan of the<br/>\nUniversity of Calgary, who conducted one of the best studies.3 Changes in<br/>\ndiet don&#39;t produce as dramatic or consistent results as ADHD drugs. &quot;Diet<br/>\nreally does make a difference for a relatively small number of kids,&quot;<br/>\nconcludes Susan Roberts of Tufts University, author of Feeding Your Child<br/>\nfor Lifelong Health (Bantam Doubleday Dell, 1999). &quot;But until more long-term<br/>\nstudies are done, we can&#39;t prescribe one diet that will help all of them.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example:<br/>\nhttp://psychologyto<br/>\n&lt;http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20030514-000001.html&gt;<br/>\nday.com/articles/pto-20030514-000001.html<br/>\n&quot;Does a poor diet lead to crime? Some British researchers think so. They<br/>\nstudied the behavior of 231 inmates at a maximum-security prison in the U.K.<br/>\nHalf of the group received daily capsules containing vitamins, minerals and<br/>\nessential fatty acids, while the other half took dummy pills. Antisocial<br/>\nbehavior among inmates was recorded before and during the trial. The<br/>\nsupplement group broke prison rules 25 percent less than those on the<br/>\nplacebo. The greatest reduction was for serious offenses--instances of<br/>\nfighting, assaulting guards or taking hostages dropped 37 percent. There<br/>\nwas, however, no significant change in the control group. Lead scientist<br/>\nBernard Gesch, a physiology researcher at Oxford University, wasn&#39;t<br/>\nsurprised by the findings, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry. A<br/>\nformer probation officer, Gesch once gave supplements to young delinquents<br/>\nunder his watch and noticed an improvement in their behavior. That<br/>\nexperience helped shape his later research. &quot;Nutrition as a causal factor in<br/>\nantisocial behavior is so simple it&#39;s been overlooked,&quot; he says. &quot;We think<br/>\nof behavior completely as a matter of free will.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to back up this point for what a personal anecdote is worth, my wife<br/>\nhas suffered from terrible and frequent migraines for twenty or more years;<br/>\nthis has cost us many many thousands of dollars for pills and been a big<br/>\nworry with increasing dosages (which doctors suggest is needed as they said<br/>\napproaching menopause leads to more and worse migraines). She has seen<br/>\nmultiple doctors for this (with little good advice, beyond prescriptions).<br/>\nShe finally cut all corn syrup out of her diet -- which was difficult since<br/>\nit is often in stuff like bread and ketchup. She had also dropped over the<br/>\nyears other things, like raisins, shrimp, and so on which have sulfites<br/>\n(corn syrup can have sulfites added too as a preservative). Guess what --<br/>\nmigraine free for many weeks (except when she had two following chicken<br/>\nnuggets and a soda from Wendy&#39;s). The longest time free of headaches in her<br/>\nlife. This is like a miracle in her life! My wife had also know about the<br/>\ncorn syrup and sulfite connection for years but discounted it (she was<br/>\navoiding diet soda because of the negative effect of those diet additives).<br/>\nAnd now that she is headache free as a baseline, it will be easier to see<br/>\nwhat does and does not cause headaches. Now, I&#39;m not saying sulfites are an<br/>\nissue with your kid (although you might look at food allergies in general).<br/>\nNor am I saying they cause any migraines for someone else. I&#39;m just using<br/>\nthis as an example of how a seemingly intractable problem which was<br/>\ncontinually getting worse suddenly went away with a change of diet. By the<br/>\nway, Al Gore (remember him?) tried to ban added sulfites in the USA in 1985<br/>\nbut was prevented by industry lobbies. What a difference that ban might have<br/>\nmade in our lives. Added sulfites are banned in some parts of Europe. Still,<br/>\nthey may be fine for most people. And even in my wife&#39;s case, it may be some<br/>\nother issue related to high fructose corn syrup instead of sulfites (corn<br/>\nsyrup may interfere with the body&#39;s sugar regulation and damage the pancreas<br/>\nin ways different from plain table sugar),<br/>\nhttp://en.wikipedia &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup&gt;<br/>\n.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup<br/>\nand there may be other triggers as well (some of which we have been working<br/>\nto reduce for years). There are also things which are triggers for other<br/>\npeople (like MSG, chocolate, perhaps caffeine) which don&#39;t seem to be much<br/>\nof a problem for her. But in any case, things have improved miraculously<br/>\nwith a change in diet -- including my wife&#39;s (and the rest of the family&#39;s)<br/>\ngeneral level of happiness and also her ability to deal with stress (since<br/>\nthe social stress -&gt; painful headache connection seems to have been broken).<br/>\nShe has also found she has less craving for carbohydrates without the corn<br/>\nsyrup in her diet, and less swings of blood sugar which result in mood<br/>\nswings (since both adults and kids tend to get cranky when their blood sugar<br/>\ndrops).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blog of someone with more serious food alleries to sulfites:<br/>\nhttp://www.leapscou &lt;http://www.leapscout.com/&gt; t.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d suggest, encourage your child to try a simplified diet for a while (no<br/>\nprocessed stuff like lunchmeats or regular hot dogs or high fructose corn<br/>\nsyrup). Just eat, for one possibility, rice, beans, water, selected fruit,<br/>\nvegetables, etc. and see if it helps. Frozen vegetables may be easiest to<br/>\nuse -- our child will even eat frozen small vegetables (peas, carrot pieces)<br/>\nwhile still frozen (in fact, insists on it). It may also take a weeks to see<br/>\na change while the rest of the additives get out of his system. At the very<br/>\nworst, eating a good balanced diet for a few weeks is unlikely to hurt him.<br/>\nIf it does, consider if something specific in the simplified diet<br/>\n(especially specific fruits) may also be a problem. Ideally, if your budget<br/>\ncan afford it, try organic foods as well (although they are often more<br/>\nexpensive). Timing may be another issue -- perhaps your kids simply gets<br/>\ncranky in when his blood sugar drops and that coincides with the time of the<br/>\ndrama lessons? Eliminating high fructose corn syrup may help with any<br/>\nfluctuating blood sugar levels as well. Ideally you could talk with a doctor<br/>\nwho knows a lot about food and healing (a good nutritionist?) first -- there<br/>\ncould always be other underlying medical issues as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, if your kid is already non-cooperative, changing diet may be<br/>\nyet another struggle (e.g. no McDonald&#39;s for a kid who lives on it might be<br/>\na shocker, and may try even further your own ability to cope). And as one of<br/>\nthe links above suggested, there may be no guarantee of success -- diet and<br/>\nfood allergies can be very child specific. I&#39;m sure many people here may<br/>\nhave advice on how to make a diet change in an unschooling sort of way<br/>\n(other than by &quot;do it my way&quot;), including having your child participate in<br/>\nthe dietary change. But I&#39;d once again emphasize the point that most of the<br/>\n&quot;battle of the bulge&quot; (both for kids and adults) is best fought in the<br/>\nsupermarket, not on the home front. :-) I&#39;m sure lots of people here would<br/>\nhave advice on avoiding a battle even at the supermarket.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a diet change seems like a complete impossibility, at the very least keep<br/>\na diet diary yourself for your child (or better, help him do it for himself)<br/>\n-- and see if there is any obvious connection between behavior and specific<br/>\ndiet. For example, it might help you track down if his behavior is more<br/>\nproblematic an hour or a day after your kid has soda pop at McDonalds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you might hear a lot of people saying -- my kid eats whatever they want<br/>\nand it includes McDonald&#39;s and lots of soda pop and they are perfectly fine<br/>\n-- and that may well be true, for *their* kid. Mailing lists also tend to be<br/>\nself-selecting, in that if a particular approach doesn&#39;t work, people just<br/>\ndrop off and you hear mainly the success stories. Most people can eat<br/>\nsulfites too (like in red wine or raisins) without crushing headaches -- but<br/>\nmy wife can&#39;t. To think, she used to start every day for years with Raisin<br/>\nBran. :-( Again, once you have identified a food issue, then people here<br/>\nwill have lots of advice on dealing with it -- including the approach which<br/>\nhas been outlined here of making sure the kid knows about it and then<br/>\ndealing with consequences of their choice to themselves and others.<br/>\nSometimes my wife might chose to have red wine even knowing it will give her<br/>\na migraine later. Although since a food choice may affect the entire family<br/>\n(e.g. siblings fighting), the issue may be more complex than a kid just<br/>\nharming themselves by bad choices, which gets back to an idea IO read<br/>\nsomewhere that families can be parent-centered (do as I say), kid-centered<br/>\n(whatever you want, dear), or family-centered (which entails a much more<br/>\ncomplex balancing act of various interests by both kids and adults).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow your son may already be eating really well, and may in the end have no<br/>\nfood allergies -- if so, please forgive the suggestion. The issues you<br/>\nstruggle with may well be genetic or environmental (poor drama coaching) or<br/>\njust plain old personality or in relation to the play or his brother, just a<br/>\nphase or just in relation to a specific incident. But if you have already<br/>\ntried everything else, and are at your wit&#39;s end, then diet may be worth<br/>\nlooking into as something that might help, even just a bit.

I know many kids this<br/>\nage do that, but so much more than that even!  I find myself confused<br/>\nsometimes that he doesn&#39;t understand something that comes so simply to<br/>\nme.  Pointing this out alone will help me a great deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we chose to homeschool and ultimately unschool him, we had<br/>\nplaced him in Karate.  Karate seemed to help him in so many ways.  It<br/>\nreally helped him find his center and be the child he wants to be.  It<br/>\nupsets him so much that he can&#39;t do certain things like other kids(sit<br/>\ntill, be patient, be quieter).  However, he recently left Karate.  Now<br/>\nhe is back to wear he was when he was in public school.  He was in<br/>\nkarate for a few years and he has been out for a few months.  Do you<br/>\nthink he is &quot;DE-Karating&quot;?  And if so how I can I help him through<br/>\nthis really difficult time?  He just &quot;loses it&quot; so easily before I<br/>\neven can have a chance to help him out.    He seems to be in turmoil<br/>\n(inner and outer) day in and day out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLOUD!  Yes, he is so incredibly loud its, well...  INCREDIBLE!  I tell<br/>\nhim often, SAVE IT FOR THE STAGE!  LOL  He will do well.  His director<br/>\nthinks so.  I ended up writing her an email, explaining a few things,<br/>\nand told her that we could brainstorm some ideas together to help him<br/>\nhave patience and keep his hands to himself.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kidgie@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 12/3/2007 6:30:52 P.M.

(I&#39;m usually very<br/>\ngood at helping them work out their differences.)  His anxiety is at<br/>\nan all time high, he is the most sensitive I have seen him in a long<br/>\ntime.  (not just emotional, all senses).  Recently he has joined the<br/>\nyouth theater and tells he is being yelled at constantly, and hates<br/>\nthe stage manager.  He is being told to sit alone near the desk<br/>\nbecause he is being disruptive.  Now, I&#39;d like to believe his story<br/>\nabout him being singled out like that...  but I know from experience<br/>\nwhat is going on.  He doesn&#39;t seem to understand how extreme he can<br/>\nbe.  While one person is LOUD...  he is 3 times as LOUD.  When a child<br/>\nis active he is 2 times as active.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI cry for him because I know the way people perceive him is many times<br/>\nnegative, yet I don&#39;t know how to protect him or help him through it.<br/>\n Or help him address the issues so he could have a positive experience<br/>\nwith the theater.  He wanted nothing more than to be in this play, and<br/>\nnow he is telling me he wants out, but ONLY because the teacher keeps<br/>\nyelling at him.  (he is soooo sensitive) I haven&#39;t talked to the<br/>\ndirector, I want to, but I don&#39;t know what to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what to do with him right now.  We have always lived free<br/>\nfrom diagnosis and evaluation because I always thought it was for the<br/>\nbenefit of the schools.  I wonder if I have made a terrible mistake<br/>\nand maybe someone had some answers for me somewhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone told me to read the out of sync child for some answers.  Is<br/>\ntheir anyone in a similar situation?  I&#39;m looking for any and all<br/>\nexperience.  If this post seems emotional its because it is.  I&#39;m sort<br/>\nof in the thick of it right now.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28264,"nextTopicId":28274}}
