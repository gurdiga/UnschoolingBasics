We have four children ages <br/>\n9,7,3, and 1.  For the past four years I&#39;ve been homeschooling with a <br/>\ncurriculum (mostly Sonlight).  I&#39;ve read about most methods to <br/>\ndo &quot;school at home&quot; then I read about unschooling.  At first I was <br/>\nall for it and then I worried about what would happen if they went <br/>\ninto public schools, college, what would relatives think, and talked <br/>\nmyself out of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we were on a break from &quot;school work&quot; to allow them some <br/>\ndown time and give me an opportunity to evaluate our progress when I <br/>\ncame across the subject of unschooling again.  It seemed like the <br/>\nanswer to our problem with homeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest two give me so much resistance to doing school work and <br/>\noften led to battles, arguments, and hurt feelings.  The two younger <br/>\nones would want to be involved somehow even if that meant by ripping <br/>\nour workbooks and stealing pencils.  Unschooling seemed like the <br/>\nperfect solution to all of the problems I was having with &quot;school at <br/>\nhome&quot;. So much so that I&#39;ve put aside the curriculum to see where <br/>\ntheir interest will lead us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit that this is scary for me,but I am excited as well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26822,"nextTopicId":26919}}
