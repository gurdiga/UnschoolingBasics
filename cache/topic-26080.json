Several factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did not like how the school system is inflexible regarding how each kid<br/>\nlearns.  It was more that the child must learn the way the school teaches,<br/>\nand if the child has difficulty learning that way, well, he/she has a<br/>\n&quot;learning disability&quot; or is &quot;average&quot;.  School appeared to us to be great as<br/>\nlong as the child in question learns best being spoon-fed information and<br/>\nnot allowed a lot of personal creativity.  The school system also appeared<br/>\nto enforce &quot;obedience,&quot; and though spankings are now unheard-of in my neck<br/>\nof the woods, schools have become creative in how they punish children.  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to put my kids through that, especially as dd#2 is a very<br/>\nphysical, spirited kid.  She would definitely be labeled as having some kind<br/>\nof &quot;disability.&quot;  dd#1 is a lot more pliable, and in my mind more delicate.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want her creativity getting snuffed out, though I&#39;m sure she would<br/>\n&quot;thrive&quot; (ha-ha) in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nReinforcing this was the work of John Holt.  That really put us on the road<br/>\nto trusting our kids with their own learning and curiosity.  Some of his<br/>\nstuff was absolutely amazing and made so much sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd to this what John Taylor Gatto has put out.  He claims (and I believe<br/>\nhim) that the school system was put in place to create obedient factory<br/>\nworkers.  That factory could be an assembly line or being a code jockey like<br/>\nme.

This is important to remember in the deschooling process and the learning to unschool process.  I stiff feel so sad that my kids have let some reading go.  I work hard to keep the panic inside as I watch them choose only computer games and movies.  We do have some remarkable moments together and the stress of school and homework has completely left our lives.  After a couple of months I have no doubt it is the right thing to do I only hope that I will see all their interests of creativity and love of learning trickle back with the same passion I used to see before school did its damage.

It was really odd, because I wanted to<br/>\npull them (I have 2 kids, 1 son and 1 daughter) out of<br/>\nschool during Easter break, but hubby wanted to have<br/>\nthem end the year in ps.  My son was in 4th grade, and<br/>\nmy daughter was in 3rd.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had alot of issues with teachers, the principal and<br/>\nbullying.  Needless to say, my son was miserable, and<br/>\nso was my daughter.  We researched about<br/>\nhomeschooling, and found some good books at the<br/>\nlibrary, and also alot of information at Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>\nwebsite.  I also had alot of support from the groups<br/>\nthat I have joined.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think for you homeschooling choices, you need to<br/>\nfind what fits with your family.  With us the choice<br/>\nwas easy.  After all the stuff they had to do with ps,<br/>\nwe decided that unschooling was a much better fit with<br/>\nour lifestyle.  We didn&#39;t want to take the kids out of<br/>\nschool, and then put them right back at it, at the<br/>\nkitchen table.  We did however buy the 4th and 5th<br/>\ngrade all in one curriculum workbook from Sam&#39;s Club (<br/>\nI think it was about $10).  Me and the kids opened it<br/>\nup, and looked at some of the stuff it had for them to<br/>\ndo, and closed them.  We haven&#39;t taken them off the<br/>\nshelf since.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing to see how much they can learn, when they<br/>\nrelax, and show me the things that they are interested<br/>\nin.  Kids are truely amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son loves to play video games, and search for<br/>\nthings on the internet, and loves watching Naruto. <br/>\nIt&#39;s gotten to the point, that I really get into<br/>\nwatching it with him. We have some really good<br/>\ndiscussions about the characters, and what we think<br/>\nmight be their next moves, the Naruto books that are<br/>\nout, and who our favorite characters are.  We even<br/>\nfound a store not too far from here that carries some<br/>\nNaruto stuff. We have learned about what takes the<br/>\nyucky stuff off from pennies, and what it takes to dig<br/>\nup hostas, and things about hurricanes.  I like<br/>\nunschooling, because you learn things from living<br/>\nlife, not by sitting at the table for hours learning<br/>\nfrom books.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone can tell you which way to go.  It<br/>\nall depends on what you feel you need to do.  My kids<br/>\nwon&#39;t attend public school anymore.  They are happiest<br/>\nat home, doing the things they enjoy.  There are books<br/>\nthat tell you what your child should know at each<br/>\ngrade level. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.  I forgot to mention that we live<br/>\nin Michigan.  We are happy homeschoolers, and enjoy<br/>\nthe freedom that homeschooling provides.  We travel<br/>\nmore now, than we did before, and have alot of fun<br/>\nnoticing things outside, that we normally wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nsee.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck on your decision.  If your son would like a<br/>\npen pal, let me know.  I know my son would love to be<br/>\nable to talk to kids about Naruto.

Even<br/>\n&gt; the school system <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t take that away from him.

I want to go back and start right then, and tell him he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave to go into that dumb school and sit for hours...<br/>\nI remember him being so excited about going to school, and how much <br/>\nfun it was... in kindergarten.. in the beginning of the year.. then <br/>\nthe teacher was mean.<br/>\nThen came 1st grade, and the teacher was mean.<br/>\nThen came 2nd grade.. and this teacher really was mean- I could hear <br/>\nher yelling at the kids from the hallway outside the classroom.<br/>\nWe moved to a different school district halfway through 2nd grade. <br/>\nThe new school, right across the street from our new house, was not <br/>\nany better. In fact, it was worse!<br/>\nNot just in the lack of quality teachers, but the system was so very <br/>\nout of whack.<br/>\nIt is just so sad.<br/>\nI love being home with my son (11) and daughter (2).<br/>\nMy son is so much happier now that he has time to do the things he <br/>\nloves to do. Ok, so for the past few months, much of that time is <br/>\nconsumed with the Nintendo DS. And the computer. And twice-a-day <br/>\nepisodes of Myth Busters and late night episodes of Naruto on Cartoon <br/>\nNetwork.<br/>\nBut I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t notice every single night, after his &quot;shows&quot;, <br/>\nhe gets into bed and reads The Boxcar Children, or Deltora Quest, or <br/>\nwhatever he is into that week. <br/>\nAnd his creativity is not gone in the least. Even the school system <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t take that away from him. I&#39;m just glad we pulled him out of <br/>\nthere before they had the chance to sap it.<br/>\nI feel like we are truly living life now. We have the opportunity to <br/>\nenjoy it. He can be a child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my main questions are as follows:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Have you ever pulled a child out of pub school in the middle of<br/>\n&gt; the year?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is HS&#39;ing a big adjustment for the PS child?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; How do you choose which &quot;curriculum&quot; to use?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tell me about the different methods of HS&#39;ing?

Our ds (age 10) stays glued to one screen <br/>\nor another most of the time, when left to his own devices. But, even <br/>\nthough it has ony been a couple of months since I would say we <br/>\nstarted deschooling, we are seeing some positive signs. He seems <br/>\nhappier. He appears less stressed. He smiles more. He&#39;s more willing <br/>\nto try some new adventures. I think we are observing something about <br/>\njust how stressful school was, and about how it was not about <br/>\nlearning, in many ways, but, in our case, about coping.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is discouraging that ds does not want to read. Last school year he <br/>\nseemed to love reading, devouring 400-page books like they were <br/>\nnothing. Now, it&#39;s one or two reference books for a few minutes every <br/>\nnow and then. He likes being read to sometimes, so we keep doing <br/>\nthat. I trust it will return to him when he is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also regret I did not hs from the start, but there were <br/>\ncircumstances then that dictated what I could do, and I have to get <br/>\nover that. We are where we are today, and there is so much we can <br/>\nlearn together. I do believe those who say we parents need to <br/>\ndeschool in this period, too. It is a challenge to keep letting go of <br/>\nold ways of seeing him, and expectations about what he should be <br/>\ndoing. I re-focus myself on this every day, as it is not yet a habit. <br/>\nI remind myself to watch, listen to him. And, we do different fun <br/>\nthings out of the house like meeting other hs-ers, going to different <br/>\nmuseums/parks/gardens, going on long hikes. And, I try to keep my <br/>\nfretting to a minimum, and private. This seems like such a huge life-<br/>\nlesson time for each of us, and all of us as a family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to deschool for 6 months and then see where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobbin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Donna Vanderlip <br/>\n&lt;donnavanderlip@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been reading the messages here for several weeks now and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>have felt such tremendous support.

As far as finding things to do and people to be <br/>\nwith, how about you follow your son&#39;s lead?  Just hang out at home <br/>\nfor a bit and let him decompress.  Gradually he will probably tell <br/>\nyou what he wants - more friends, sports, books, games, etc.  You <br/>\ncould go to the library and just pick out a variety of stuff to see <br/>\nwhat he likes.  There&#39;s no need to rush.  Ask him if he wants to go <br/>\nto the playground or to church or to an orchard or a farm or a <br/>\nconstruction site or a movie or a lake or a sports event or whatever <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested in, and let him know that you take him seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t think that his teacher would help him out when someone <br/>\nhits him, show him that you will help him when he needs it. It&#39;s <br/>\ngreat that he&#39;s young and will tell you what is bothering him and <br/>\nwhat he wants.  A lot of kids stop telling their parents these <br/>\nthings after trying and being ignored or not taken seriously.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re his mom!  You can help him enjoy life again and help him to <br/>\nknow that it&#39;s not okay for people to hit him or for his teacher to <br/>\nbe mean to him.

In retrospect, I could have hooked up with the unschooling community and probably worked it out by switching shifts and paying someone to keep her in thier home on the days I could not cover. But at the time I had no information and knew no one else who homeschooled or unschooled.

Being around jerks is &quot;contagious&quot;.  It makes  other children jerks, so <br/>\nthat they can fit in.  It is hard enough for  a parent to be around jerks.  <br/>\nChildren do not need to be around this.   If he is home schooled, and develops a <br/>\nstrong sense of self, and self  confidence, then he will be less likely <br/>\nsuccumb to the peer pressure of also  being a jerk when he is in an adult world.  No <br/>\none deserves to be treated  poorly.  Your son deserves to be treated with <br/>\ndignity and respect.   Thus, he will grow up to be an adult that treats others <br/>\nwith dignity and  respect.  No child needs to, or deserves to be bullied.  This <br/>\nis one  of the major reasons why many chose to homeschool.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;It just kills me that he is sooo sensitive,  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\ncompassionate for other people&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat great qualities to have!  Those characteristics can be a great  use when <br/>\nhe is older.  Maybe he will be a doctor that actually has bedside  manner!!!  <br/>\nDon&#39;t let his good qualities be squashed by having him in  school, where him <br/>\nbeing him is made out to being a bad thing by jerks.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as finances, I remember seeing books out about homeschooling on a  <br/>\ndime.

I tried to school at home and used the <br/>\npublic school ciriculum as a guide since I thought I would send him <br/>\nback in a year. School at home &quot;works&quot; for some families who want to <br/>\nmake sure the kids know the same things that schooled kids have to <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooling is very different it is not doing school- there are <br/>\nvarrying degrees- some people let the child choose what he wants to <br/>\nlearn and then &quot;learns&quot; it in the traditional manner (books, papers, <br/>\ninternet, classes), others allow the child to learn what they want <br/>\nto but still hold onto traditional methods of parenting (chores, <br/>\nlimits,) there are still others who want what is called radical <br/>\nunschooling which is trusting that the child knows what they want <br/>\nfrom birth and they can be co-partners in the household. It is <br/>\nletting go of the need to control and let them fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about trusting that your child will learn what they <br/>\nneed to by living life- they learn to walk because they see us <br/>\nwalking and it works faster than crawling, they learn to talk so <br/>\nthey can tell us what the heck they want, they learn to read because <br/>\nthey see you reading and they have books around them and tv too. <br/>\nThey learn to do math by living in the real world and do ing <br/>\neveryday math, they learn to write because they see the written word <br/>\nand want to do it, they learn history and science by watching tv, <br/>\nvideo and books and current events. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey learn because they are human- they learn what is important to <br/>\nthem not what is important to their parents or the school system. <br/>\nThey learn because they want to, they need to - to satisfy their own <br/>\nthirst for knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is scary for begining because it is scary to &quot;trust&quot; <br/>\nyour child to take care of themself with you as facilitator not <br/>\nteacher. It takes his interests and let him go from there from one <br/>\nthing to the next in his own time and space and time.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy daughter is 4.5 and she is unschooled- she is amazing- sponge bob <br/>\nteaches her a lot of new things and the computer has 6 games that <br/>\nare hers, these games taught her the abc&#39;s and is teaching her to <br/>\nread. she could type her name first and surprised me that she could <br/>\nwrite her name. All without a lesson. She knows a lot of things that <br/>\nare not &quot;schooly&quot; but important anyway. She is free to eat and sleep <br/>\nand think and play and learn and do what SHE wants to and needs to. <br/>\nWe do not have chores but she loves to vacumm and clean when she <br/>\nwants to, she eats when and what she wants and loves to tell her <br/>\nolder schooled friends that homeschool is fun- no I will not be <br/>\nputting her into school she is mush too free for that<br/>\n<br/>\nyour son and you will need to deschool (take a long break) before <br/>\nunschooling- declare summer break and just play and have fun.
