We would have saved a lot of years of floundering and not really being happy with what we were doing at home.<br/>\n  __________<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I started homeschooling my ds (now 13-1/2) with a PreK package when he was about 3-1/2.  We were doing Kindergarten when I first &quot;ran into&quot; unschooling.  It appealed to my heart but couldn&#39;t yet make sense to my teacher-trained mind, so I started asking questions.  Unfortunately, the lady I asked (considered an &quot;expert&quot;) must have been having a really bad day or something, because she seemed to take my seriously searching questions as some kind of attack and absolutely blasted me.  My dh&#39;s reaction to that was, &quot;If they can only get nasty and attack instead of explaining how it works, then there must not be anything to it.  Look for another way.&quot;  So, we&#39;ve spent the last 10 years doing some version of &quot;school-at-home&quot;, experimenting with different philosophies, but none of them really fit us.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We have become more and more relaxed over the last several years, mostly forced by circumstances, but it has been working.  We&#39;ve also finally met a few local unschool families this last year, and even dh saw that it WAS working, so we&#39;ve started asking questions again and researching (LOT more info available now).  I&#39;m currently reading Grace Llewellyn and Amy Silver&#39;s Guerilla Learning, but I&#39;ve got a stack waiting including John Holt&#39;s Teach Your Own, Mary Griffith&#39;s the unschooling handbook, Alison McKee&#39;s From Homeschool to College and Work, and Cafi Cohen&#39;s &quot;And What About College?&quot; and Homeschoolers&#39; College Admissions Handbook.  As you can probably tell from the list, our most serious concern at this point is making sure that ds is able to get into his choice of college and get the financial aid he will need (he already knows what he wants to do).  I also have a 7yod, but she seems to thrive no matter what we do, as long as she can talk, sing, and have someone nearby to<br/>\n interact with (and switching completely to unschooling would also give me more time to help her learn the sewing and piano she&#39;s been asking me for).<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was referred to this list by one of the unschool families I mentioned earlier as it being gentler with &quot;newbies&quot; than some of the others, so I&#39;m hoping to learn from what all of you have to share.  I&#39;m sorry this intro has been so long, but I&#39;ve been lurking for about a week and couldn&#39;t figure out a shorter way to really give you the picture of who and where we are.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yolonda<br/>\n   <br/>\n  P.S.
