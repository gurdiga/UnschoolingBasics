Realistically, unschooling doesn&#39;t have to be one iota better than any other kind of parenting or &quot;education&quot; as long as its no worse. That sounds like kind of a downer, but from the standpoint of communicating with others, it can save a lot of hurt feelings and defensiveness.

He did a few years at a local Waldorf school - 2 of kindergarten and then first grade.  In the Waldorf schools they really don&#39;t begin to teach any alphabet/reading stuff until the 1st grade and they take that very slowly so when he was finished with 1st grade, although he knew the alphabet by then, he really wasn&#39;t reading or writing. For the first few months of &quot;2nd grade&quot; I was trying to do school at home but then life took over and we switched onto the unschooling path. Anyway, my point was that for the most part, he was taught some basics in the beginning, but then pretty much left alone - he did start reading himself mostly through using the computer....but as for books, he really just still enjoyed me reading to him at bedtime. Sometimes when I read, it is late at night and I&#39;m just too tired to read much before I fall asleep. One day (within the past year), as I was falling asleep and we were at a really good part in the book I just said &quot;I can&#39;t read anymore...do you want to keep reading?&quot; and to my surprise he said &quot;yeah&quot;. Well, all of a sudden he was reading like 40 pages at a time to himself! I&#39;d go to pick up where he left off and not have a clue what had happened so he&#39;d fill me in and then we&#39;d continue from there.  That was really cool.<br/>\nBut I still wondered about his writing.  He seemed to have NO interest at all in writing and I wondered if he even remembered how to write certain letters. It wasn&#39;t a huge deal but I just wondered.  Well, just recently he has started writing - not writing stories or anything but just incorporating a lot of words into his drawings.  It&#39;s so nice to see him do these things all by himself on his own time because he wants to. In the unschooling community, of course, you always hear that kids will teach themselves these things, but when your kid really does take off on their own it&#39;s just a really cool thing to see when you&#39;ve been brought up in the traditional mindset of &quot;you need to go to school to learn how to read and write  blah blah blah blah&quot; :)<br/>\n-Robyn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334892198,"authorName":"Ann","from":"&quot;Ann&quot; &lt;auntannies2002@...&gt;","profile":"auntannies2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: So excited!!","postDate":"1283001405","msgId":44706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk1YjI3dCt0M2QyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk1OWg1MStscmloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44705,"nextInTopic":44707,"prevInTime":44705,"nextInTime":44707,"topicId":44704,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for sharing, Sarah.
