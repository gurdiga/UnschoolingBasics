Having a toddler is a full time job and you need rest.  What we do advocate is thinking outside the box so that as much as possible, EVERYONE is happy and gets their needs met.  You might try simply being more flexible and seeing what happens.  You may not NEED to stay up with an 11yo or you may.  You won&#39;t know unless you try.  If you try something and it doesn&#39;t work well, see where the kinks are, see if there is a way you can work them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  I am 42 and pregnant with my 6th child.  I&#39;m wore out.  My dh travels ALOT.  Last night, I really, really needed to go to sleep (this was at 8:30).  So I asked my 12yo if he would mind helping the younger kids to bed.  He agreed and then I talked with my younger ones (ages, 9, 7 and 6).  I talked to them about how tired I&#39;ve been and needing to rest.  We talked about when we thought would be a good time for everyone to go to bed.  Then I went to sleep.  I heard no fussing, no arguing.  When I got up this morning, everything was turned off and the kids were still asleep in their beds.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just got back from a stockshow this last weekend where all the showers sleep in the big barns with their animals.  The lights stay on and the bigger kids tend to stay up all night talking and playing around.  My little 9yo went to bed before 10 every night with zero prompting from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Christy Putnam &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:personal_balance@...\">personal_balance@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 17, 2006 10:45 pm<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Bedtimes - from a current CA member<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi everyone, I joined quite a while ago then took some time away <br/>\n&gt; from the<br/>\n&gt; computer to try to reorganize my life.

Instead I watched for<br/>\nsigns of sleepiness.  When he would stand and look at something and rub<br/>\nhis little head or twirl his hair round his finger, I knew he was getting<br/>\ntired.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell him it was time for bed and I didn&#39;t make him leave his<br/>\ntoys but I started to quiet the house.  I dimmed the lights, turned down<br/>\nthe TV, changed into my pj&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I would ask &quot;can I hold you?&quot;  and we would snuggle on the sofa<br/>\nor in the rocking chair.  He might bring a toy or two with him.  I would<br/>\ntalk quietly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan nursed until he was four and very often when we were close and the<br/>\nhouse was quiet and he was tired he&#39;d want to nurse.  That almost always<br/>\neased him into sleep.  If I still had things I wanted to do once he was<br/>\nasleep I&#39;d put him in our bed or on the sofa and collect him when I went<br/>\nto bed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things about traditional bedtime that set a mom and kid up<br/>\nfor struggle.  Kids don&#39;t want to leave the action or leave their stuff. <br/>\nSo easing a little one into sleep where the action (at a quieter and<br/>\ndimmer level) and stuff is can mean a more peaceful transition to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen bedtime means a child has to be alone in his room in the dark and<br/>\nthe child wants to be in the light with people he loves, that&#39;s a<br/>\nstruggle.  Kids can sleep anywhere, on a cushion under the table, in a<br/>\nchair, on the sofa, in mom&#39;s bed, in mom&#39;s arms.   There&#39;s no reason a<br/>\nchild needs to be in his own room for sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the mom decides the child should sleep and the child isn&#39;t ready for<br/>\nsleep yet, that&#39;s a struggle.  It might not be as convenient to the mom<br/>\nto watch for signs and ease baby into the quiet and into sleep but it&#39;s<br/>\nmore peaceful, less stressful for both.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of struggle comes from a mom who wants things to be a certain way<br/>\nand a baby who has a different idea.  What is your baby&#39;s idea of a good<br/>\nway to fall asleep?  He might not be able to tell you, but you can find<br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\n ***me<br/>\nbeing much more tired and cranky than I already am just because I waited<br/>\nfor<br/>\nmy 11 yr old to go to bed...  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there some reason your eleven year old can&#39;t be up without you?   If<br/>\nhe knows he can come and get you if he needs you, and if he has access to<br/>\nsnacks or whatever else he needs can&#39;t he just be up until he&#39;s ready to<br/>\ngo to bed? <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan was eight or so when he began to enjoy being up late.  I told him<br/>\nhe could come get me if he needed anything.  I asked him to please stay<br/>\nin the house, I left snacks in convenient places and asked him to turn<br/>\nout the lights when he went to bed.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***Do the kids run the household or am I missing something here? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nBy this I think you mean - Do the kids go wild, disregard their parents<br/>\nand do just whatever destructive awful, thing they can think of ? -   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are kids who would go wild they are probably kids who&#39;ve had a<br/>\nlong power struggle with their parents.  If kids have felt powerless -<br/>\nhave been told when to sleep and when to wake, have been told what to eat<br/>\nand what not to eat, have been told what they can do, etc. then they<br/>\nmight be hungry for power and it might be expressed by doing all those<br/>\nthings a parent has restricted.  If a kid has felt disregarded,<br/>\ndisrespected by having his desires repeatedly turned down or dismissed he<br/>\nmight not see the value in regard and respect for others.   If this<br/>\nscenario exists it&#39;s because it was systematically constructed by the<br/>\nparents, even though they didn&#39;t want to construct such a thing and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know they were doing it.  Unschooling can end the destructive<br/>\npower struggle between parents and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen there is no power struggle there&#39;s no negative implication behind<br/>\nthe idea of a kid running the household.  My kid could absolutely run<br/>\nthis household.  He&#39;s responsible and confident.  But we never think of<br/>\nit like that do we?  We never think that one of the things we hope as<br/>\nparents is that a kid could one day run a household! (in all it&#39;s good<br/>\nimplications).  We worry that if we let up on our controls for a minute<br/>\nour kids will &quot;run all over us.&quot;   Bummer. <br/>\nWhy would we want to think of our kids like that?  Our kids are nice<br/>\npeople. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you&#39;re a family then the household is as much your son&#39;s as yours.<br/>\n Why shouldn&#39;t he have power and freedom there?  When no power struggle<br/>\nexists kids don&#39;t go crazy and do terrible things the minute their<br/>\nparents aren&#39;t looking.   There&#39;s no reason for them to go crazy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you have concerns about what your eleven year old would do if you<br/>\nwent to bed and left him up alone, talk about those here and get ideas<br/>\nfor changing the dynamic in your house so that you can feel ok going to<br/>\nbed and he can feel happily secure staying up by himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223344266,"authorName":"Christy Putnam","from":"&quot;Christy Putnam&quot; &lt;personal_balance@...&gt;","profile":"personal_balance","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Bedtimes - from a current CA member","postDate":"1137559542","msgId":9170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNmUwMWM2MWJlYSQwOWZlYWI2MCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMzc1NTc5NjQuMzcwNS4zMzMxOC5tMUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9221,"prevInTime":9169,"nextInTime":9171,"topicId":9170,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I joined quite a while ago then took some time away from the computer to try to reorganize my life.
