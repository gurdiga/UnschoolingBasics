I would love to set up a spring post card exchange and geography lesson. Before I do though, I need to make something very clear...if you sign up, you will need to follow through with sending your postcards in a TIMELY MANNER!! The last exchange, one group did not do so and one child received 1 post card ion exchange for all his hard work of sending out to the his group! Can you imagine the disappointment? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow it works: <br/>\nLog onto the Homeschool Pen Pal exchange group and become a member:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/homeschoolpen-pals/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/homeschoolpen-pals/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSend your child&#39;s name or names if you want them all to exchange separately (please say so).<br/>\n <br/>\nI will place it on a list of others across the world...aproximately 12 to 15 names per list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will email the list to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour family or child(ren) will address and make a note on the post cards about your area ...a note about something in your area...size, climate, etc. This is a geography lesson!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen  you will mail the post cards to those on the list and you should receive 11 to 14 postcards in return from many places....<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease send your info to me no later than May 10th. I will get the list out to you via email by the 16th (PLEASE BE SURE TO CHECK YOU SPAM OR BULK MAIL FOLDER AS THEY GO TO IT SOMETIMES!). Please get you postcards out to the recipients no later than May 23rd!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nDO NOT RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL, YOU HAVE TO USE THE EXCHANGE ADDRESS AT THE GROUP SITE:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:homeschoolexchange@...\">homeschoolexchange@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPebs</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39877,"nextTopicId":39894}}
