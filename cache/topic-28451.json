What and<br/>\nexciting morning.  My husband starts with &quot;I really have an open mind<br/>\nbut...&quot;  Why don&#39;t my children have to respect me (not throw cheerios<br/>\non the floor, leaving dishes with food on the table, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old are your children?<br/>\n<br/>\nRespect has nothing to do with obedience.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd cleaning is just not important to small children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCleaning is hard for me.  I don&#39;t find joy in it (I think it is just my<br/>\nown stubborn rebellion).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---but who, do you think, is capable of changing your attitude <br/>\nabout cleaning? Your kids? Your neighbor?<br/>\n<br/>\nWho should take responsibility for your attitude?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want to foster that same attitude in your children? The I HATE <br/>\nHOUSEWORK attitude? Wouldn&#39;t you love for them to see how pleasant <br/>\nhousework can be? How do you think that would work? By telling them how <br/>\nmuch you hate it? Why would they choose to do something so heinous?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould taking pleasure it in kill you? Do you think a positive attitude <br/>\nabout cleaning might possibly rub off on your children?<br/>\n<br/>\nDid your mother hate housecleaning? Did she make you do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did you come to hate it so much? Do you want the same for your <br/>\nkids? And your grandkids? How would you go about changing it? What <br/>\nsmall steps could you take toDAY?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are just beginning to let go<br/>\nof our own conditioning but man it is hard!  It is really easy to slip<br/>\nback to &quot;I told you to do it!&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSure it is! That&#39;s what deep breaths and a positive attitude can change <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if I said, &quot;I told you to do it!&quot;? Would that change how you <br/>\napproached it? Would you feel better about it if I just did it happily <br/>\nand joyfully---without bothering you? Would you wonder just what *was* <br/>\nso much fun about cleaning? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not easy. And it&#39;s exhausting at first. But the more you do it, <br/>\nthe easier it gets. Promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions for the nitty gritty of letting go of our<br/>\npreconditions.  Can we ask them to do things to help out?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a QUESTION??????<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if they say NO? Are you willing to take that as an answer? &#39;Cause <br/>\na real question can be answered honestly with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot; or a <br/>\n&quot;maybe later&quot; or a &quot;in a minute.&quot; ALL valid answers to the questions, <br/>\n&quot;Can you help me?&quot; and &quot;Will you do this?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you willing to take &quot;no&quot; as an answer for a really long time? <br/>\nHappily and joyfully---no strings attached?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that &quot;Can you help_____?&quot; is a better question than &quot;Will <br/>\nyou DO____?&quot; at first. Most are willing to *HELP* a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut &quot;no&quot; needs to be a valid answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husbands question &quot;What if we lived on the farm and we needed them <br/>\nto help with<br/>\nthe chores in the morning?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you live on a farm? If not, it&#39;s a hypothetical.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Cause there would be more questions attached to that---like, did they <br/>\nask to have/live on a farm?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n(my kids would love this!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nyeah---maybe. &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s a lot of work. They might help out for a while, <br/>\nbut they&#39;re kids. It might not last long.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re having a hard time accepting and demonstrating to them <br/>\nthat housework is *play*, I doubt you would do that great a job <br/>\nconvincing them that farmwork is play! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nForget the farm labor! Start ENJOYING the housework you have <br/>\nalready---really! Be grateful that you have dishes to wash and clothes <br/>\nto fold and floors to mop and precious children to pick up after. Let <br/>\nthem see how you appreciate what you *have* NOW! They&#39;re seeing <br/>\ndrudgery through *your * eyes. Let them see JOY!

We do not support ourselves <br/>\nwith our farm; my husband works and that money is what we use to pay the <br/>\nbills.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past year, I&#39;ve begun to try to earn some money from our farm in <br/>\norder, basically, to cover food costs for our family, which is <br/>\nmoney-making of a sort. We have a very small CSA (subscription garden), <br/>\nand we raise free-range meats. Another goal of mine has been for this to <br/>\noffer a business opportunity for the kids if/ when they want it. This <br/>\nhas meant reworking our finances a bit to be able to &quot;pay&quot; them for <br/>\ntheir work time since indoor help has always been optional and not tied <br/>\nto their budget. Outdoor work is still totally optional, but it carries <br/>\nwith it the opportunity to make &quot;extra&quot; money on top of their regular <br/>\npart of the family budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I don&#39;t require the kids&#39; help in anyway, it still affects my <br/>\neveryday parenting because there are things *I* must get done to keep <br/>\nthings running smoothly, which makes me less available at these times <br/>\nthan others. I try to do much of my work outside of my parenting hours <br/>\n(i.e. before the kids wake up in the morning), but there&#39;s always enough <br/>\nwork to be done that it&#39;s not always possible. This has offered the kids <br/>\nopportunities to do things on their own while I&#39;m out in the fields and <br/>\njust a shout away, creating a really safe atmosphere for them to explore <br/>\ntheir own independence and self-sufficiency in their own ways. It also <br/>\noffers some really nice one on one time with the kids when one of them <br/>\nchooses to come out and work with me, as well as some great outdoor time <br/>\nfor all of us when we&#39;re all outside together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids love our life. I love our life. Farming, at least with the <br/>\nluxury of an outside income, isn&#39;t at all contrary to RU philosophy, <br/>\nI&#39;ve found.
