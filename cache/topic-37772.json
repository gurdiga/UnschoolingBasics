Power, maybe? Control? Fear?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Holt would find our lists &quot;tragic&quot; at all. I think he&#39;d be kicking us to go furtherfurtherfurther. Have you READ his books? Read them, in order, and then get back to us. I&#39;d have a hard time believing that anyone, after reading &quot;Escape From Childhood,&quot; could see Holt as anything but extremely radical in his thinking about children!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know, *anyone* can start an elist about &quot;non-radical&quot; unschooling.

That&#39;s *one* of the reasons these lists exist. But I think<br/>\n they&#39;ve been well-established as *different*.

When I first discovered unschooling (and its &quot;patron saint,&quot; John Holt), I read each of his books, in order. I admit to being a little freaked out.

They&#39;re the words <br/>\nof Pat Farenga. The lengthy quoted passage on that webpage titled &quot;What is <br/>\nunschooling?&quot; is from a chapter in &quot;teach your own - the John Holt book of <br/>\nHomeschooling&quot; that was ENTIRELY written by Pat Farenga. There is not a single word <br/>\nof John Holt&#39;s in that passage. Not one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolt&#39;s &quot;original educational unschooling vision&quot; doesn&#39;t exist as such. <br/>\nHaving given up on reforming schools, he set about figuring out how to help <br/>\nfamilies rescue their children and keep them out of the clutches of schools without <br/>\nhaving to fear the law and it&#39;s minions. He called that effort unschooling. No <br/>\none today uses the word unschooling to mean all homeschooling.
