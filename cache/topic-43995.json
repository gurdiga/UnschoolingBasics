I&#39;m a member who has never posted but this thread hit a cord.  I had problems with my eldest son&#39;s violence towards my younger two sons for many years, and it got the point -- without getting into too much detail -- that it just became too much for me and my husband to handle before our family just split apart.  We homeschooled and unschooled our son for nine years, but we had to come to the conclusion of seeking assistance from outside the home before it got the point of no return as we feared for the safety of everyone in the home due to my son&#39;s explosive rages during the day while my husband worked outside the home.  My son, who is now 13 going on 14, is autistic, has asperger&#39;s, and is on the low spectrum of mentally retarded and is extremely physically strong and has been enrolled in a school for children with special needs for the last two years where he receives therapy for his emotional issues and physical meltdowns and outbursts, and we get coached along as well as a family so that we can contribute positively to our son&#39;s success in the home and outside the home.  He&#39;s not perfect and once in a while he&#39;ll revert and have an emotional and physical meltdown, but we are much better at handling the situation, and he too now has a better grip of calming himself down with the tools he has received at school when he&#39;s in the process of a meltdown.  Progress has been slow but steady but things have gotten better as there is a light at the end of the tunnel where there is hope and there is proof of change for the better as he feels so much better about himself, and we are in loving support of trying to do all we can to help him succeed in life and seeking assistance outside the home was the way to go for us. It may not be for you, but sometimes a fresh, different perspective helps and no one knows how it feels unless they&#39;ve walked in your shoes as its an emotionally exhausting toll-taking road.  I have walked in your shoes, dear, and believe me, you aren not alone. If you want to e-mail me privately, please do.

I had tried alot of different things regarding this including a  <br/>\nbouncy toy that stood up after being hit.  I ended up telling him that it  <br/>\nhurt my feelings when he hit me and I didnt hit him and didnt like him  <br/>\nhitting me.  Later that afternoon he asked me if I would come into his  <br/>\nroom and he talked to me about it....  He had been hit at age 4 by a boy  <br/>\naged 8 at Church! and even though he hit him back that was the first and  <br/>\nonly time he has been treated like this.  He had also been asking me to  <br/>\nhit him!!!!  which freaked me out somewhat also.  So when I went into his  <br/>\nroom he said to me that he often has a &#39;picture in his head&#39; of Jacq  <br/>\nhitting him.  We spoke about how it made him feel, how he could do  <br/>\nsomething else when those pictures came into his head and also that it was  <br/>\n*not* his fault and that Jacq was the one with the problem and not ds.  I  <br/>\nalso told him that we would never hit him ever, and that if anyone else  <br/>\ndid to let me know and I will help him deal with it right away.  This was  <br/>\nabout 3 weeks ago and he hasnt hit anyone since the talk.  I think it  <br/>\nhelped him to release his feelings and feel safe.

Don&#39;t worry about &quot;being consistent&quot; with rules or teaching your kid lessons, the most important lesson he needs is that his dad loves him, so focus on that. Treat kid-days like a vacation - kids don&#39;t expect all the same rules on vacation so it won&#39;t &quot;undermine&quot; the other parent. <br/>\n*****<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that you son&#39;s pretty high energy, you could suggest big-body things for him and dad to do together.

Find him older guy friends, people who can pick him up and throw him, or be climbed on, or at least keep up with him ;) Ask around people with intense teenage boys to see if any would be willing to play with a little guy (like a big brother program!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really important to notice what he gravitates toward and what seems to help. Its easy to see the bad stuff :( so make a conscious effort to notice the good stuff. Write it down even! That will give you more tools and options. Its just as important to Notice - out loud to your son - when things are better, even if that&#39;s marginal. I know at first, with Ray, we had to notice things that weren&#39;t as bad as they could have been and go from there. That helps you see him in a better light, but more importantly, it helps Him see himself in a better light, as someone who has tools and skills. I&#39;m talking about things like noticing, if he throws something, when he&#39;s not throwing At another person and saying something positive about that- that&#39;s important. It will help him build better skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk with him Outside of stressful situations and come up with strategies for when he melts down. Things for him to try, things for You to do if he loses it completely. Ask him what he thinks helps, or might help and experiment. Check in later to see if the experiment was okay - something like shutting him in his room might be okay even if it seems hard in the moment if he&#39;s agreed to try it as a one-time thing to see how it plays out. Also bring him into the process of coming up with strategies for dad (I&#39;ll have another post about dad).<br/>\n<br/>\nIts important to help your guy feel like he has plenty of choices, and also that he has plenty of capabilities. You can say &quot;yes&quot; all day long, but if he needs a chair to reach the light-switch, can&#39;t open a jar without help, can&#39;t find his socks and then it rains he&#39;ll fall apart. Little things like that will add up to &quot;this is the worst day of my life&quot; without you even noticing! So look for ways to make his life easier overall. Help him feel in control so that when the world is out of control (and it will be) he&#39;s less likely to fall to pieces (but still have strategies in place for when he does, because he will). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso come up with strategies and agreements with your dd for what to do &quot;in the moment&quot;. Let her know you want her to be safe. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348218801,"authorName":"Rachelle Marsden","from":"Rachelle Marsden &lt;overhereinheaven@...&gt;","profile":"musicgluttony","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] how to deal with violence","postDate":"1273649839","msgId":43997,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltMm1fZlJ2dG9UMG9feFgwbWVhc1dWSGZPTXhSa0oyTFBsT1MzdUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdGREQwOUJELTdCMUYtNEYyMy1CNzczLUExMzkwNDBGQjVEOEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdGREQwOUJELTdCMUYtNEYyMy1CNzczLUExMzkwNDBGQjVEOEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43995,"nextInTopic":44009,"prevInTime":43996,"nextInTime":43998,"topicId":43995,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"shed any light on DS s tantrums and violence (in the process of writing this, I have resolved to keep finding more ways to shower him with YES and love and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1575074980\">shed any light on DS&#39;s tantrums and violence (in the process of writing<br/>\nthis, I have resolved to keep finding more ways to shower him with YES and<br/>\nlove and kindness, to be a &quot;bottomless well&quot; to his seemingly &quot;bottomless<br/>\npit&quot; of need)    In situations where I feel confused by my children&#39;s<br/>\nbehaviours (control issues), I look at how I&#39;m being, as a reflection.

A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2145729501\">Hello wonderful Unschoolers,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been lurking on this list for a while now, and have benefitted  <br/>\ntremendously from other people&#39;s questions and answers.  A hearty  <br/>\nthank you to all for the very thoughtful responses you write -- I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know how you find the time, let alone the clarity, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nextremely grateful that you do.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I need help with right now is my 10 year old son&#39;s violent  <br/>\nbehavior.   He has always been a sensitive kid -- as in, if he spilled  <br/>\nhis milk he&#39;d go ballistic, screaming at everyone over the  &quot;waste,&quot;   <br/>\nthreatening to lick it up off the floor, completely unable to let it  <br/>\ngo.  (He was NEVER yelled at or punished in any way for spilling milk  <br/>\nor other accidents; even if the glass broke I would just calmly clean  <br/>\nit up -- sometimes I&#39;d even humor him by saving the shards of glass in  <br/>\na paper bag since he&#39;d be insistent that we could glue it back  <br/>\ntogether again.....)  He seems to explode almost any time things do  <br/>\nnot go his way, though the rest of the time he is a sweet,  <br/>\naffectionate, incredibly smart kid.  Over the years, as he&#39;s gotten  <br/>\nbigger, his outbursts have become more physical -- hitting, kicking,  <br/>\neven biting, and often throwing large/dangerous objects (i.e.  <br/>\nchairs).  It&#39;s to the point now where his 7yo sister is developing  <br/>\ncoping strategies for dealing with her brother&#39;s tantrums, and is  <br/>\ncareful to avoid situations that might set him off.  Sometimes she is  <br/>\nvery frustrated by having to compromise so much, and I worry about her  <br/>\nnot feeling safe in her own home.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple years ago I read the book Explosive Child, and from that  <br/>\nstarted to look for ways to decrease the frustration level for my  <br/>\nson.  However, he often explodes over things I cannot control (like  <br/>\nthe weather), making that strategy seem rather limited.  Since joining  <br/>\nthis List I have been more conscious of trying to say  &quot;yes,&quot;  and  <br/>\nletting it sound like  &quot;yes&quot;  (I&#39;d gotten in the habit of saying   <br/>\n&quot;maybe,&quot;  for fear of setting him up for disappointment and tantrums  <br/>\nif I said yes and then couldn&#39;t make it so -- but he hears  &quot;maybe&quot;   <br/>\nas  &quot;no,&quot;  or at least as  &quot;only if more important things get done  <br/>\nfirst&quot;, that sort of thing.)  I&#39;ve also been trying to recognize his  <br/>\nneeds better and respect his desires more.  I&#39;ve given up the power  <br/>\nstruggles over candy and bedtime, I make efforts to be physical with  <br/>\nhim in positive ways (hugs, playful wrestling, etc.) and so on.  I try  <br/>\nto think of special projects we can work on together.  I try to find  <br/>\nways to support his desires and dreams.   I try to be more gentle,  <br/>\nover all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it seems it&#39;s never enough.  On a given day he might make 5  <br/>\nrequests that I say yes to, but the 6th one is something I can&#39;t do  <br/>\nand he goes nuts -- sometimes even screaming things like,  &quot;you don&#39;t  <br/>\neven care about me, you don&#39;t even WANT me to be able to do _______.&quot;   <br/>\nSometimes I gently point out the 5 things I said yes to, but that  <br/>\nfeels icky and doesn&#39;t seem to do much good.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids spent last weekend at their dad&#39;s house.  I got a call from my  <br/>\nex around 8pm on Friday, desperate to know what to do as DS was  <br/>\nscreaming and throwing things.  Apparently he&#39;d promised them ice  <br/>\ncream, but they were obnoxious in the store, and didn&#39;t quit when he  <br/>\nsaid they&#39;d better or no ice cream...... so, no ice cream.  In the car  <br/>\non the way home DS kicked and screamed, and once home he punched and  <br/>\nthrew things.......   Their dad threatened to cancel the next day&#39;s  <br/>\nactivities if DS didn&#39;t stop, which he didn&#39;t.  The first thing I  <br/>\nsuggested was to quit making ultimatums, as DS is not capable of  <br/>\nresponding to them in that state.  While we were talking DS slipped a  <br/>\nnote under his door apologizing  -- and I said, get off the phone now,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s your opening.   I then got a call from DD, who was clearly  <br/>\ncowering in her room, calling me and talking a mile a minute to shut  <br/>\nout the conflict around her.  Eventually they went back for ice cream.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect my kids&#39; dad will be confronting me soon on how to deal with  <br/>\nDS.  He (their dad) has never been a hands-on parent, aside from  <br/>\ntaking them on occasional fun outings on weekends.  He has always  <br/>\nlooked to me to figure things out and deal with them, and advise him  <br/>\nhow to proceed -- except he doesn&#39;t catch on well to the gist of  <br/>\nthings, instead taking whatever I might say as a script.   It&#39;s  <br/>\nannoying (and lonely) for me, but that&#39;s not the issue right now.  I  <br/>\nworry that he&#39;s going to suggest or even insist upon counseling and/or  <br/>\ndrugs, and even though I sometimes wonder if that&#39;s where we&#39;re  <br/>\nheaded, I really think there&#39;s some other unmet need here, and would  <br/>\nstrongly prefer to figure that out and deal with it directly.    <br/>\nHowever, I have no idea what that  &quot;unmet need&quot;  could be, even though  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been dealing with this for 7-8 years now, so I&#39;m not sure I could  <br/>\nmake much of a case for avoiding the drugs/therapy approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I have 3 questions.    1) Can you shed any light on DS&#39;s  <br/>\ntantrums and violence (in the process of writing this, I have resolved  <br/>\nto keep finding more ways to shower him with YES and love and  <br/>\nkindness,  to be a   &quot;bottomless well&quot;   to his seemingly  &quot;bottomless  <br/>\npit&quot; of need);   2) How would you suggest I handle the violent  <br/>\noutbursts when they do occur?  (I&#39;ve tried and quit the   &quot;loss of  <br/>\nprivileges&quot;  strategy, and  &quot;time out&quot;  never worked, but it&#39;s not  <br/>\nacceptable for my daughter to get hurt or for things to get  <br/>\nbroken....... and honestly, being hit and kicked myself doesn&#39;t do  <br/>\nmuch for my relationship with my son either!);    and 3) any  <br/>\nsuggestions for what I might say to his dad when he turns to me for  <br/>\nanswers on how to deal with all this?    That&#39;s a lot to ask.  #2 is  <br/>\nmy biggest priority.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!<br/>\n<br/>\nstephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43980,"nextTopicId":43844}}
