The solution that made the most sense for our family was for me to have my medical offices attached to my home and to work part-time (usually two days per week).  When my children were babies I had the advantage of being able to work even fewers  hours for awhile and I could l pop upstairs to my  residence to breast feed or comfort a sick child as needed.  I have also been blessed to find a wonderful, nurturing young lady who comes to our home to be with the children while I work. Having her is the next best thing to being there myself (or dh of course).    I like that my children me as a person who has dreams and needs of her own, and responsibilties outside home and family.   Because I am just downstairs and they can come and &#39;see me&#39; if they need to, they feel secure that I am always available to them, so <br/>\nvery rarely DO they ever come looking for me while I am with patients. At times I am exhausted (even just working 2 days) because my job involves so much nurturing of other people that sometimes by the end of my work day I have little &#39;nuturing &#39; left in me for my family ...but my children are respectful of  my exhaustion .  I usually get all sorts of excited shrieks of &#39;HI MOMMY!!!!&#39; when I first come in the door followed by hugs and kisses, and then they go back to whatever they were working on (or watching) .  Sometimes I feel guilty-ish that I cannot be 100% my usual self after a long work day - but overall this arrangement works for our family.  I like that they know that my dream was to become a doctor and how I worked to achieve that goal, and that it makes me happy to do my work.   <br/>\n     Obviously not everyone has a job that could be done from home or that could be done part-time. <br/>\nI knew going into my chosen career that I wanted to be a mommy (though I didn&#39;t know I would homeschool yet) and I specifically chose a specialty that would allow me flexible hours with few emergencies.  Had I chosen a different career with less flexibility I would have looked into other options-  not working at all for awhile, job-sharing, changing to a job that I could do from home or at least part-time, or working a shift opposite dh so one parent would always be be with the children.  None of these options is quite like mommy being home all the time but are some possible compromises for a mom who either wants to needs to work.  If you have a job that can be done from home, even hiring someone to come to your home (while you are there working in another room) is a great option- this could even be perhaps an older homeschooling child .  Anyhow just some thoughts and ideas ...I hope this helps. <br/>\n     With regard to other people questioning your decision to homeschool- wow- that is definitely something most homeschoolers I know struggle with at some point. Not everyone feels the need to explain their choices....some do... My parents were both school teachers (public school) and I know they were somewhat taken aback intially when I announced our decision.  They know see what a wonderful thing homeschooling can be . Anyhow, I did not feel the need to explain too much- though answering the questions of my parents usually involved more elaboration (because I knew they were honestly interested ) than those given to a casual acquaintance.  <br/>\n     Ironically (getting back to working) working from home has given me LOTS of opportunities to discuss homeschooling with people I barely know.  My offices are in the basement of our home and often my patients hear my children running happily through the house just over their heads.  The natural questions come up about  how many children I have, how old my children are, etc.,   As my children entered the ages where people assumed they would be in school,  I would get questions from my patients about why the kids were home....this has led to many a conversation about homeschooling.  I have to say that SO many people are supportive of our homeschooling status and many reply &#39;i wish that had been an option when my kids were young&#39; and &#39; i think you are doing a wonderful thing&#39;. etc.,  It never hurts to have that extra support !  I expected to have to come up with some sort of  &#39;pat answer&#39; regarding our decision to homeschool just to satisfy the superficial curiosity of casual aqua<br/>\nintances who may or may not agree with our choices .   Instead, I have loads of supporters who enjoy hearing about the kids and how much we love homeschooling.  I have met many other homeschooling families through work, and have been able to offer encouragment to moms and dads who are considering homeschooling for their own families.  So this is very satisfying for me .<br/>\n     Good luck Jennifer!

We live <br/>\nin Guelph, Ontario, Canada. I&#39;ve been reading the posts for the <br/>\nlast couple weeks and appreciating them soooo much. This approach <br/>\nof unschooling and the parenting style that goes with it just seems <br/>\nso loving and respectful to the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy question/request for support is this: I&#39;ve recently started <br/>\ntelling family members that my son won&#39;t be going to school in the <br/>\nfall; instead we&#39;ll be homeschooling, and it hasn&#39;t gone over well. <br/>\nMy dad just called to tell me that they&#39;re concerned that it&#39;s not <br/>\ngood for my son to get the message that my whole world revolves <br/>\naround him, and by homeschooling, I&#39;m sending this message. They <br/>\nthink it&#39;s best for my son to see me as someone with a career and <br/>\nlots of interests outside of the family. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was caught off guard by this conversation and didn&#39;t really know <br/>\nhow to respond. I did say that what I love most of all is being <br/>\nwith my son and didn&#39;t see any point in going off to work all day if <br/>\nthat&#39;s not what I want. I also think that as he gets older, I may <br/>\nhave more time to pick up other interests. But what do you think? <br/>\nIs it unhealthy for a child to see his mother focused so much on him <br/>\neach day? How would you answer someone who has this concern?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":273524597,"authorName":"jentamar","from":"&quot;jentamar&quot; &lt;jenniferlehman@...&gt;","profile":"jentamar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"new member -- question","postDate":"1174064277","msgId":22280,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0ZWlhbCttNWJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22282,"prevInTime":22279,"nextInTime":22281,"topicId":22280,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, My name is Jennifer and I m the mom of a 3 1/2 year old boy.
