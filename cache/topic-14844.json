We started","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2012220670\">Misty,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been in your shoes before my second dd was born.  We had a first very loving dd, who slept with us and nursed still all night!  We started talking about adding another and that month I was preggo!  I couldn&#39;t believe it happened so fast as my first dd took some work.  So I ended up with the same due date as my first dd.  Well surprising to me I lost most of my milk supply right away with the pregnancy and she slowed way down on nursing and just ate more food.  Poor thing!  Then two months before my due date she did not ask for it at night and that was that!  But she started sleeping 12 hours at night about July (I was pregnant in June) and weaned her bed time nursie in December.  I don&#39;t know if they just sense the changes coming and grow each day or what because when I look back we thought three years was so young to have a baby!  How could I do it and still be with her!  But it was fine. Plus a baby needs our skin and smell but for the first months it sleeps<br/>\n alot!  SO that I think gives us time and dd to adjust too.  She slept with me and dh in our King bed right in the middle.  We talked all the time about the baby coming and how she needs to help guard the baby and we get to all sleep together.  IMO if your dd was to &quot;like&quot; sleeping in her big bed she will notice that the baby is with you and she may feel &quot;left out&quot; even more.  As far as safety we were worried too so I slept with the baby (Rylee) in another room for three nights and Jenna and dh slept together.  Then I joined them and at night we would look and talk about the baby and how Jenna was this small one time and all the things she use to do.....  I really think the more Jenna heard her name in the stories as we amazed ourselves over the &quot;new&quot; life we created she was fine with this little person.  I slept between the kids so Jenna could not roll on her.  I feel it is important not to have the kids next to each other until the baby can crawl.  Then he/she will be<br/>\n strong enough to tell you and if you didn&#39;t hear be strong to get up.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It is weird now that Jenna is 6 she is missing my time with her (alone) because for the first time she has been saying things like &quot; I wish Rylee was not with us anymore, I am done playing with her&quot;.   It is sooooo sad!  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now we are trying for baby #3 and worried for being out numbered with only having two hands!  Ya know!  ;o)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Misty it so works out and its amazing to me how we analyze it and the work it takes to raise this amazing creatures but when they arrive it seems so worth all that hard work of night wakings and such.  I am so happy to hear and talk to others who co-sleep and nurse past age one.  ;o)  Best wishes to you and your journey.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  smiles~Angela <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126884268,"authorName":"HMSL2@aol.com","from":"HMSL2@...","profile":"dobsiedoe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: OT- having more children","postDate":"1150982777","msgId":14859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2ZC5iNTU3M2JkLjMxY2JmNDc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14853,"nextInTopic":14866,"prevInTime":14858,"nextInTime":14860,"topicId":14844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Misty to respond to both of your questions...

IF you have a toddler who  <br/>\nwould roll on the baby then some other plan needs to be worked out. I have 4 and  <br/>\nthere is 2 years between each of the last 3(that wasn&#39;t planned). I nursed <br/>\neach  baby longer then the other with the last still nursing.<br/>\nNicholas was sleeping in our bed but at some point we moved a toddler bed  in <br/>\nhere. Some nights he goes to the toddler bed and some nights he falls asleep  <br/>\nwith daddy and then is moved across the room. In the am if he wakes along <br/>\nwith  Cameron they play on the bed together, it&#39;s nice. Cassidy used to sleep in <br/>\nhere  but opted for a room with tv access any hour. <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for one child... My oldest is 14.9 and I was single for the first 4  years <br/>\nso not the same situation though I&#39;ll throw out some thoughts. You can get  <br/>\nto the point where the child isn&#39;t so needing of you by offering creative self  <br/>\nplay toys. Time and age will change things but not  fully. Bringing in a <br/>\nhelper sounds wonderful but I wonder when that helper  leaves if you then are <br/>\nentertainer bc now you might have a child we doesn&#39;t like  to be alone. Or if you <br/>\ndo naturally have a child who seeks a playmate then I  would consider a <br/>\nsibling. <br/>\nMy son seemed ok when we lived in an apartment and I was single but once I  <br/>\nmoved into a house and met someone he was asking for siblings. It was almost <br/>\ntoo  late bc by then he was nearly 6. Sure they play together now but the <br/>\ncompetitive  situations are challenging.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn the end each situation is manageable.. one child or 4 (or more). <br/>\nIn relation to unschooling hands on/involved parenting is major. Sure  we can <br/>\nskip preschool but the true test I see is when a families children  reach <br/>\nschool age. I see loads of infants and toddlers at the playground but when  the <br/>\nkids hit age 5-6 strangely those families who hung with the  homeschoolers opt <br/>\nfor silent soap opera days while their children are in  school. My point is <br/>\nwith one child I think you are going to feel the  pressure to do school out of <br/>\nfear that the child would be lonely or that you  would need to be the playmate. <br/>\nI can tell you I have 4 and I am still all of their playmates more for each  <br/>\nthan I was when I only had one.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t unschool a single child my thoughts lay more on  you <br/>\ncomments about needing assistance for one while considering another. I can  <br/>\ntell you it will all work itself out if you work with it as it comes. The  <br/>\nfuture for you and your family is wide open. Embrace your hopes and dreams and  <br/>\nmake them a reality because 10 years from now you may wish you  had. <br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\nMom to Dustin 14.9, Cassidy 6.5, Nicholas 4 & Cameron 2<br/>\nUnschoolingmaine.com<br/>\nDrewsbrittanys.com<br/>\nSome days we may appear to be doing nothing but day  dreaming. <br/>\nAmerica was built on dreams. Dream on my friend, dream   on.........LLD<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Here&#39;s our other thought dh and I are wondering for sure  whether we <br/>\neven want to have a second. So are there any of you out there who  <br/>\nunschool only 1 child? You&#39;d think it would be easier, but I&#39;m <br/>\nafraid it  would be more difficult. Right now my dd constantly needs <br/>\nmy attention. I  know it&#39;s pretty normal for the age, but she always <br/>\nneeds me or someone to  play with her. I&#39;ve actually hired a <br/>\nmother&#39;s helper to come in once or  twice a week to help take the <br/>\npressure off. So my concern with just one is  that with her being at <br/>\nhome all the time she&#39;ll need my companionship longer  and more <br/>\nfrequently than I can give it. So please respond if you&#39;ve had a  <br/>\nsingle child that you&#39;ve unschooled since birth.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys have always  given me great food for thought to help me <br/>\ngrow, so I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll give  me some things to ponder to help in <br/>\nmy decision.

I night-weaned him at 21 mo and he continued to <br/>\nnurse until 29mo, when he stopped cold turkey.  Luckily for me, I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t get pregnant until he fully weaned, so I was able to get <br/>\npregnant 2mo later.  There is a 3.5yr age difference and it has been <br/>\nwonderful.  Jared was old enough to understand about being gentle and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t really have too many jealousy issues.  It was hard on him, and <br/>\nprobably took us 6 ~ 8mo to really get on track with the two kids, but <br/>\nit has been worth it.  Jared also co-sleeps with us.  What we did was to <br/>\nsidecar the crib to our bed (we also have a king, and a memory foam <br/>\nmattress) and Jared slept (and still sleeps) in the crib and Chase <br/>\nsleeps in the middle or between me and the crib.  It works great for <br/>\nus.  So, if you have room (and have a crib), you might want to try that <br/>\narrangement, or you could look into getting a toddler bed for your room <br/>\n(let her pick it out and the sheets and stuff to go with it).<br/>\n<br/>\nPreschool was a bust for me.  Jared didn&#39;t really like it and I <br/>\n*thought* it would give me more time with Chase.  It was actually <br/>\nworse.  I had to get the baby up early and take him out in the cold to <br/>\ntake Jared to preschool, then had to interrupt his naptime because I <br/>\nthen had to pick Jared up again.  Preschool was only 3hrs, so it really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t give me much time to get anything done.  It was really more of a <br/>\nhassle.  I finally took Jared out after Spring Break and things have <br/>\nbeen so much calmer in our household.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some!<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have 1 dd now 2.5 my original plan was to wait until she was 3 so<br/>\n&gt; that I could have 1 on 1 time with the second child when she was in<br/>\n&gt; preschool.
