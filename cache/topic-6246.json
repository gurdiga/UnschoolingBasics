I&#39;m not so stupid <br/>\nthat I think I *could* stop him. His friends&#39; parents think that they <br/>\ncan forbid things and have their children not do anything that was <br/>\nforbidden. I won&#39;t fall for that silliness. That has just made his <br/>\nfriends dishonest with their parents. They sneak and lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may drink, but doesn&#39;t---maybe a glass of wine with supper some <br/>\nnights. He doesn&#39;t like beer or hard liquor. There&#39;s always beer and <br/>\nwine and champagne in our &#39;frig&#39; and hard liquor in the cupboard. No <br/>\nstealing. No lying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe smokes pot---well, he did. Since NBTSC, he&#39;s quit----I take that <br/>\nback. I just asked---he&#39;s cut back a lot. He&#39;s a member of  NORML. He&#39;s <br/>\ntried mushrooms---scared me to DEATH. I asked that he not do that any <br/>\nmore----that&#39;s just plain dangerous. Only two kinds of mushroom <br/>\nhunters---*very* good ones and dead ones. He&#39;s quit that. Mostly <br/>\nbecause of our talks about it---then he looked it up online.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m asking him these things as we&#39;re watching &quot;That 70s Show.&quot; He&#39;s <br/>\nhonest with me because he knows that he won&#39;t be lectured or punished. <br/>\nWe talk a lot. A LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nSex. He has a girlfriend for almost 2.5 years now. Yes, the are <br/>\nsexually active. We&#39;ve talked about birth control and STDs. He (and the <br/>\nneighbor children) have had access to condoms for years now. I&#39;ve kept <br/>\nthem in a closet upstairs since he was 13/14. He gets a box in his <br/>\nChristmas stocking. His girlfriend is on the pil (they use both). We&#39;ve <br/>\ntalked about sex and marriage and children and well---anything he wants <br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think you *can* stop a teen? The best you can do is to be honest <br/>\nand open. To talk a lot. If you trust them, they will trust you and be <br/>\nhonest and open with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Cam were to wind up in the emergency room, I could answer the doctor <br/>\nhonestly because *I* know. If he winds up in a bad situation, he can <br/>\ncall me at any hour and know I&#39;ll be there to pick him up. He&#39;s never <br/>\ndriven high. How do I know? Because he&#39;s called me to pick him up when <br/>\nhe felt too out of it to drive home safely.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafety is *much* more important than being the parent who has all the <br/>\npower. My child doesn&#39;t fear me, so he&#39;s willing to share much more of <br/>\nhimself with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s kind and gentle and honest and generous and real. He trusts me, <br/>\nand I trust him.
