Everyone of you have made me","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1134254368\">Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a lurker coming out to say &#39;Thank you&#39; to those who ask interesting questions and to those who share their wisdom. Everyone of you have made me a better parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one son, Viyan (6 1/2) who wanted to drop out of school within the first few weeks of kindergarten. He is bright, curious, imaginative, conversational and a perfectionist - school just didn&#39;t work for him.  I had to have him stay to complete the school year. I was a full time working mom, on the first year of tenure track and so had logistical issues. I am also a single parent. In any case, given the academic schedule and because I work in a research institution, my teaching demands are fairly low which gives me a ton of flexibility. We started homeschooling at the beginning of summer and I knew fully well that unschooling was the way to go for our family. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot that there are not moments when I get panicky (if you know any East Indian family, you would know how psyched up we are about formal education, if you haven&#39;t met any, watch the documentary Spellbound), and I try to remind myself that my anxiety and panic is mine. And the more relaxed approach is what works for him and for both of us as a family. I would rather spend the energy that I would spending forcing him to do formal school on exploration and creating an interesting life for us. And of course, I have had to let the housekeeping standards go. My office has always been messy, piles of papers for my seventeen research projects and all that jazz. Now because we work all over the house, it is all messy. I am slowly learning to be okay with it, and not keep putting things away every half hour because everything will come out in fifteen minutes anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I have no doubts at all about our unschooling decision.  I believe it and have the evidence - he is learning a ton all the time - whether it is watching TV or being read to, playing on his computer, playing board games, helping me cook (occasionally!) he loves to crack eggs, play with dough for roti, playing with legos (both of us love legos) or taking a walk or whatever. I think he prefers being read to because it is a more of an interactive, social activity. Moreover, he wants more complex plots than Harold the Purple Crayons - so picture books are for looking at - Harry Potter and such is for reading:) But he is not ready to read these on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also very deeply interested in math concepts rather than numerical exercises. So we have explored the concepts of multiplication, fractions, exponents, infinity, googol (also how it was misspelled by Larry Page). After watching CNN election coverage with me, he has shown interest in percentages, apart from many other history/civics conversations we have been engaged in during and post election. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not radical unschoolers though - more of organic homeschoolers - because I do have to be on campus a couple of days a week. I found a babysitter (an immigrant like myself) who gets our educational choice. And my classes are in the afternoon so I don&#39;t have to rush him out of the house. Next semester,  I have scheduled two evening classes, hoping that it would be even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned, thank you to all you guys! Now, here are the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love being with him all the time and both of us are learning so much together. But I need to establish a good rhythm to make my (professional) work and attention to Viyan reasonably balanced (not to mention my  health). As I mentioned, he goes to a sitter when I have to be in school (class, office hours, faculty meeting) - say about ten to fifteen hours a week. I can do my class prep/grading and other teaching related stuff with him around. But my research work takes more focus than my teaching stuff. Right now, I am working nights (when he goes to bed before 11 pm) between 11 pm and 3/4 am. Or if I am too exhausted (which I am, because as a single parent to a single child, there is not much buffer for either of us) to work, I work from 4 am until 9 am or so (till he wakes up). But I am not a morning person, so most days, I find that I am not able to wake up at 4 am. I will be very interested to hear ideas on how to make this work. Because, I love my<br/>\njob, need it, cannot go part time (will lose visa status),  need to publish (plus love, love my research). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question: if unschooling implies no expectations about college, how do you guys save for college? Considering the current economic situation, I am worried about finances. I make reasonably good money, but still have debts to be paid off. Apart from the home mortgage and insurance, I have no real savings and would like to start saving for Viyan&#39;s future.
