At first I was like &quot;what?!&quot;  <br/>\nI&#39;ve loved love and logic, it was our first step towards respecting  <br/>\nchildren, letting them own their problems, stepping back but being  <br/>\navailable to listen, etc.<br/>\nBut when i started to think about it, i could see where some of it  <br/>\nwould be not *living* unschooling. This weekend we went to my cousins  <br/>\nhouse and I just could not stand it! There were my six mobile kids (I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think Avari counts much for this), as well as one cousins  <br/>\nchild, two children from another cousin, a pair of siblings, another  <br/>\npair of siblings, and some neighborhood kids. There were so many  <br/>\nthings that I couldn&#39;t even mention here.<br/>\nI am excited to see it, I don&#39;t even think I could explain what I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking, but wanted to share that I think I&#39;ve seen the light. We&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen living unschooly for a few months, but it&#39;s starting to take  <br/>\nhold and become instinctive.
