For the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-627518540\">Another question I have is about bedtimes as we are also on the opposite side of most <br/>\npeople.  I CAN&#39;T regulate my kiddo&#39;s sleep even if I wanted to.  For the most part it&#39;s all <br/>\ngood, she has short sleep cycles that last a few days, then catches up with great long <br/>\nstretches of sleep.  She does go to sleep in the middle of the night very often (midnight or <br/>\nso), takes her nap around 5 pm sometimes.  Other days she goes to sleep very early and <br/>\nkind of by accident, when I don&#39;t even expect her to.  I still nurse her to sleep everytime, <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t fall asleep by herself yet.  The nights when I&#39;m totally spent, however, we have <br/>\nproblems.  Some evenings I can tell she&#39;s exhausted but really fights any attempts to be <br/>\nput to bed.  These are the times I don&#39;t know what a radical unschooler would do.  I know <br/>\nwhat I do -- 1) go to bed myself and my hubby plays on the computer with her on her non <br/>\ntired nights 2) deal with po&#39;d tired kiddo who requires constant attention at a time of day <br/>\nwhen I&#39;m not a really nice person anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 2.5 and I used to really try and make her go to sleep on a schedule when she was <br/>\nyounger, probably up to about 1.5 -- she cut out her naps very early on (needs total dark <br/>\nand quiet or be completely exhausted sleep) and I felt the need to keep them in, read all <br/>\nthe &#39;expert&#39; sleep books, etc.  This is at the core of the issue as I lost track of what her <br/>\nactual tired state is in lieu of a schedule.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter discovering radical unschooling, reading on this group, your website, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>\ngroup about not scheduling bedtimes we went in the opposite direction thinking that <br/>\neventually she&#39;ll find a rhythm that works for her.  I haven&#39;t found a clear cut answer for <br/>\nkids who would stay awake till they fall down unless the parent does something like <br/>\nactually put them to bed.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThe opposite direction has worked out all right, but definitely not perfect.  We&#39;re night <br/>\nowls, so it really didn&#39;t affect our evenings or mornings and for the most part she&#39;s now in <br/>\na good place sleep wise.  However, I have no way of influencing (please insert appropriate <br/>\nword for radical unschooling) her to sleep when she is tired, but not yet an overtired, wired <br/>\n(she gets wired) little ball of unfocused energy.  Turning off lights tips her off that I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to try to get her to bed.  She probably still remembers the struggles from a year ago <br/>\nand the times I&#39;ve slipped inbetween. :(  Putting on a movie, reading a book, any kind of <br/>\neye contact keeps her awake, interested, active, nursing, playing, nursing, bouncing while <br/>\nnursing, then it&#39;s crying cuz I don&#39;t want to nurse on empty anymore as it really starts to <br/>\nhurt.  At what point is it ok, if ever, to turn off all stimulus despite VERY strong protests <br/>\nfrom your child because you know they would sleep if the conditions stayed conducive for <br/>\nmore than 15 minutes?  Tonight, after nursing reading for an hour in her room with the <br/>\nlights on and she couldn&#39;t even stop bouncing to nurse anymore, I just turned the light off <br/>\nand lay down next to her.  She was really mad at me!   I felt horribly guilty and like a bad <br/>\nunschooler.   She fell asleep in 10 min... <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso is it ok to limit nursing sessions to media free environments?   Whenever she watches <br/>\na movie, she likes to nurse, whenever she nurses, she likes to turn on a movie -- sleep <br/>\nand movie don&#39;t mix, nursing and sleep do... That seems to be the most hot topic between <br/>\nme and her...  We have a tv, 2 laptops which, she knows, can go anywhere, and my hubby&#39;s <br/>\ncomputers in a 2 bedroom apartment, so it&#39;s always calling her name.  She can watch <br/>\nwhenever she wants and we watch with her.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you :)<br/>\nYelena</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37773,"nextTopicId":37772}}
