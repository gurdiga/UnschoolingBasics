I&#39;d also, maybe, say something about how I want them to come to church joyfully and not to see their relationship with their faith from a resentful, heel-dragging perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nI totally believe that most actions can be seen as choices. I can choose in any given moment what I want to do and how I want to approach it. Knowing that helps me to be the mother I want to be more often than not. If I believed that I had to do something, I would probably feel less loving, less giving, less free to be who I want to be in relation to whatever that mandatory job was. School is less like a job than parents may think. School is more like being press ganged, where there really isn&#39;t any way off the ship without being released by your parents or the school. You can quit jobs, you can change careers, you can ask for time off or look for a promotion or move to more flexible scheduling. I would much rather that Simon and Linnaea do things because they want to do them, because they see things they can gain from the activity, cleaning their room, or fixing lunch, or taking a Kung Fu class, than because they felt obligated to do them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\nI was having a discussion with my very good friend, whose children go <br/>\nto private school (she knows I homeschool but doesn&#39;t know anything <br/>\nabout unschooling).

I feel that this concept of HAVING to do anything is a big reason we&#39;re unschooling! Why do we HAVE to have a schedule? Why do we HAVE to wake up at 6:30 am? Why do we HAVE to go to Sunday school? And the answer is exactly that you DON&#39;T HAVE TO!! We absolutely choose to do things such as these. So my response to your friend would have been, &quot; How sad for you that you feel like you HAVE to do things in your life that you don&#39;t feel good about! But I don&#39;t feel that way so that&#39;s why we&#39;re not in Sunday school anymore!&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Or something along those lines anyway!
