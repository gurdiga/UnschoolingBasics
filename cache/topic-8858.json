But you don&#39;t have to convince him of unschooling, just<br/>\nhomeschooling. I wouldn&#39;t talk much about unschooling actually, but<br/>\nsimply log everything they do to keep him happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not worth a battle over homeschooling with an ex....they can sue<br/>\nyou for custody and I&#39;ve seen that go wrong more than once. A good<br/>\nfriend is fighting for her child right now, over a custody<br/>\nissue....hoping to homeschool again. It can get really ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.....read &quot;colouring outside the lines&quot; by Roger Schank and<br/>\n&quot;Guerrilla  schooling&quot; (I think that&#39;s the name) and learn how to<br/>\nsupport their interests and not focus on grades or other such nonsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may not be able to homeschool....please consider that before you<br/>\nmove. And how do your children feel about living off the grid? I<br/>\nreally think unschooling works best if you have access to museums,<br/>\nstores and fun places to visit regularly. I know people that live<br/>\nrurally and make sure they get to places, but if you&#39;re too far out it<br/>\ncan be a huge challenge. Unschooling isn&#39;t about isolating our<br/>\nchildren against their will, just to fulfill our ideals of living off<br/>\nthe land. It can work beautifully, or it can be really frustrating for<br/>\nthe children, you need to make sure they&#39;re truly on board...even<br/>\nthen, be willing to make a shift if they change their minds.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8855,"nextTopicId":8534}}
