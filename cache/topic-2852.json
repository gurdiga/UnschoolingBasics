Some favorites:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, which has a silly nursing story, but I loved this book and also Joy in the Morning by the same author; Vanity Fair, by Sinclair Lewis, Delta Wedding, by Eudora Welty, The Cider House Rules and The World According to Garp, by John Irving, She&#39;s Come Undone, by Wally Lamb, The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe, as well as ALL of his novels were excellent...The Bonfire of the Vanities, can&#39;t seem to remember the title of the one I liked best.  Also, if you haven&#39;t read Tom Robbins, he is awesome; check out Still Life With Woodpecker and Skinny Legs and All.<br/>\nAnd then there was Steinbeck; I think I read everything he wrote and I thoroughly enjoyed them all...read Grapes of Wrath, Pastures of Heaven, oooh there are SO MANY excellent books by John Steinbeck.   OH YEAH and I also recommend Prodigal Summer by Barbara Kingsolver.  That&#39;s a lot of great reads...hth!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nWin 1 of 4,000 free domain names from Yahoo!
