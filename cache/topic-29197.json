I rarely poop in public because my feet don&#39;t<br/>\ntouch the floor and it&#39;s just not comfy without a bit of traction.<br/>\nA friend of mine once had a boyfriend from India who would squat over the<br/>\ntoilet (feet on the seat) to poop comfortably. (we talked about this because<br/>\nI was staying at her house and left &quot;Mommy&#39;s Pooping Stool&quot; at home)<br/>\nAmerican toileting practices aren&#39;t Human Body friendly. Especially not<br/>\nSmaller Than Average Human Bodies!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCareful not to rush this stage... the intimacy of diaper changing/toilet<br/>\nhelping is all too short lived. What an honor it is to serve this stage<br/>\njoyfully!
