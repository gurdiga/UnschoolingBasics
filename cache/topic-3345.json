I don&#39;t think the cheerio idea will<br/>\nwork since he pees sitting down if he&#39;s on the potty (dh does, so that&#39;s<br/>\nprobably why) - I could give him the idea to stand up, but that seems like<br/>\ninviting more creative target practice if you know what I mean.  On the<br/>\nother hand, I wonder if the fact he associates the potty with sitting down<br/>\nmeans that he&#39;s more interested in peeing on other things so that he can do<br/>\nthe standing and &quot;aiming&quot; thing ... hmmmmm.  Just occured to me.  Maybe I<br/>\nshould tell him he can aim into the potty too and go ahead and get some<br/>\ncheerios.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Kelly&#39;s idea about talking about keeping the dog housetrained!  Well,<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep both in mind in case he starts getting creative again.  Right now,<br/>\nhe&#39;s in love with the port-a-potty - only thing is, my daughter decided it<br/>\nwas more interesting than peeing in the toilet too so I&#39;m washing out that<br/>\ncup a LOT.

My 3.7 yo son, Nicky, is getting more<br/>\ninterested in using the toilet on a more regular basis.  He&#39;s peed and<br/>\npooped in it since before he was two, but never for very long in terms of<br/>\nnumber of days in a row.  Recently, he&#39;s decided to have &quot;naked days&quot; more<br/>\nand not use a diaper.  He doesn&#39;t have accidents, really, but he&#39;s taken to<br/>\ndoing something I&#39;d like to call &quot;creative peeing&quot;... the other day for<br/>\ninstance, I hadn&#39;t seen him use the toilet in a bit and I asked him if he<br/>\nneeded to go.  He said Very Proudly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Mama.  I had to go so I<br/>\npeed in the Bob The Builder Box (and so he had).  I pretended it was the<br/>\npotty.&quot;  Hmmmmm.  Not wanting to burst his bubble at all, but also hoping we<br/>\nweren&#39;t starting any kind of trend, I said &quot;Wow, really.  Interesting.  Do<br/>\nyou think next time you can get to the toilet with your pee?&quot;  And he<br/>\ncheerfully replied &quot;Okay!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell yesterday (another naked day) he came into the living room and joyfully<br/>\ndeclared &quot;Mama, I peed on a TOWEL!&quot; like that was the best thing, ever and<br/>\nquite proud of his accomplishmemt he was too.  The towel was in fact right<br/>\nin the bathroom, and then later he peed on another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is how would y&#39;all handle this?  I&#39;m trying to remain fairly<br/>\nneutral and just ride it out but I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s going to suddenly just<br/>\nstart peeing on lots of different things for fun.  I guess my dilemna is<br/>\nthat the unschooler in me is having a hard time not being really excited and<br/>\nlaughing at his creativity and excitement, while on the other hand, having<br/>\nhim start to experimentally pee all over the house doesn&#39;t seem like a lot<br/>\nof fun for dh and me (although likely the dog will love it).<br/>\n<br/>\nDS has taken lately to falling asleep at night in the living room watching a<br/>\nvideo, and last night was the first time he was naked when I made sure he<br/>\nhad his flashlight and got his video set up before heading to bed myself.<br/>\nHe said &quot;Mama, can you bring me a towel in case I have to pee?&quot;  LOL.  All<br/>\nof a sudden I remembered the defunct port-a-potty we had disassembled ages<br/>\nago.  I reassembled it and put it in the room for him and he got really<br/>\nexcited - he could pee while watching his video!  I&#39;m hoping that might<br/>\nreplace the towel thing (although that&#39;s not related to the video watching<br/>\nbtw - the other times he did it he was not watching a video), but I&#39;m a bit<br/>\nconcerned that it&#39;ll just be one more new spot to pee until something more<br/>\nexciting comes along, KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd is this a boy thing?
