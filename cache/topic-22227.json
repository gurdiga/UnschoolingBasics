I knew my son wasn&#39;t the person they  spoke <br/>\nof. <br/>\nHe tested at a low level and the school tried to convince us that without  <br/>\nmajor intervention he would not read. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe left school and within a couple weeks we began our  <br/>\ndeschooling-unschooling path. The following September we went to Sylvan Learning  Centers. Despite <br/>\nmy attempts to be there for my son he felt stupid (his words).  I&#39;m not a fan <br/>\nof testing but this one gave us a clue into what we should have  clearly seen. <br/>\nMy son who the school said was not paying attention, tested poorly  and would <br/>\nnever learn was suffering from shyness is all. A boy so beat down by  their <br/>\nongoing embarrassments has given up. <br/>\n <br/>\nHad I not experienced this very same thing in school he might still be  <br/>\nthere. He would be a very different boy now had I not walked out that  winter <br/>\nFriday before school vacation. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy situation may differ greatly but the end goal is the  same. Keeping them <br/>\nback is not the solution. If anything I  would bring the child home if only to <br/>\npass her on to the next grade. <br/>\nI hear you say your 10yr old is motivated. ALL children are motivated it&#39;s  <br/>\njust that not all learn the same way. <br/>\nDid your DH like school? What does he do for work? Did he learn the trade  on <br/>\nhis own? Does he like his job?<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;**************************************&lt;BR&gt; AOL now offers free <br/>\nemail to everyone.

He knows I&#39;m<br/>\nnot using a curriculum w/my 10yo and he&#39;s ok w/that.  Yesterday the teacher<br/>\nsuggested we think about holding our 8yo back, to do 3rd grade again.  She<br/>\n(the teacher) is worried because in 4th grade they do a lot of reading and<br/>\nreports.  She doesn&#39;t think my 8yo can do it.
