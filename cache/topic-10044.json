Some<br/>\ngroups are strictly ATC oriented while others do other<br/>\nforms of altered and mail arts as well.

(I also<br/>\njust joined Imagination Tribe thanks to this list.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are ready to start trading you should<br/>\nprobably be aware that trades can take different<br/>\nforms. One way of trading is through one on one<br/>\ntrades. It&#39;s the most straighforward in that you<br/>\nsimply trade the same number of cards with another<br/>\nartist, but it&#39;s a little more work to set up a lot of<br/>\npersonal trades and you build your collection a little<br/>\nmore slowly this way. One on one trades can be &quot;blind&quot;<br/>\n(where you don&#39;t know what cards you are getting, only<br/>\nthe number), or if the artist has pics of the cards<br/>\nthey have up for trade online you can request specific<br/>\ncards. I think I get some of the best cards this way.<br/>\nIt&#39;s also an easy way to get started. You can work at<br/>\nyour own pace and then request a swap with someone<br/>\nwhen you feel ready to trade.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also what are generally referred to as<br/>\npartnered swaps. I think these are the easiest kind of<br/>\ngroup swaps for beginners to get involved with because<br/>\nsomeone else sets the theme and the number of cards.<br/>\nThe host then partners all the participants up kind of<br/>\nlike one on one trades. All you have to do is make the<br/>\ncards and send them to your partner. The number of<br/>\ncards is low (usually 1-4) and the return time is<br/>\nusually quick since you are only waiting on one<br/>\nperson. It&#39;s a good way to get your feet wet. The down<br/>\nside is the same for one on one trades in that you<br/>\nbuild your collection more slowly. You also don&#39;t get<br/>\nas much variety from partnered swaps since you are<br/>\nonly receiving from one person per swap. In my<br/>\nexperience with ATCs I have found that the quality of<br/>\nthe cards in partnered swaps is not always as good as<br/>\nthe ones from one on one swaps though. I attribute<br/>\nthat to the fact that the deadlines are usually short<br/>\nso many people tend to rush to create their cards by<br/>\nthe deadline.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are the larger hosted swaps. The number of<br/>\ncards you need to create for larger swaps is usually<br/>\nhigher, though not always, and you often have to wait<br/>\na lot longer to get your cards back because you have<br/>\nto wait for everyone who signed up for the swap to get<br/>\ntheir cards in so they can be swapped out with<br/>\neveryone else. If there are international players it<br/>\ncan take quite a while (a month or more) for you to<br/>\nreceive the cards from hosted swaps. It&#39;s usually<br/>\nworth the wait and you get a good variety this way,<br/>\nbut creating the large number of cards that are<br/>\nsometimes needed for hosted swaps can be stressful for<br/>\nbeginners. If you start with hosted swaps (which are<br/>\nthe most common form of swaps on lists) I&#39;d suggest<br/>\nstarting with ones that have a relatively low card<br/>\nrequirement. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn some swaps if the requirement is low - say 3 cards<br/>\n- you can send in multiples of that number to receive<br/>\nmore cards in return. For instance I just received<br/>\ncards from a swap that had a minimum requirement of 3<br/>\ncards but we could send in 3, 6 or 9. I like 9 card<br/>\nswaps because they fill one page of a trading card<br/>\npage, so I made 9 cards and got 9 back. Doing this<br/>\nkind of swap is a good way to work your way into<br/>\nlarger swaps. You can start with the lowest number and<br/>\nwork your way up as you feel more confident.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhew, sorry! That ended up being a lot longer than I<br/>\nmeant for it to be!
