In the very near future, that&#39;s all going to change again, maybe more than once as my job is moving out of state. In the short term, I&#39;m going to be working part time and commuting to the new plant, but I don&#39;t know how long it will last so I&#39;m looking into working part time and/or from home. It&#39;s an ever evolving process!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest issue when home/unschooling while both parents try to work is finding ways to be flexible. Work odd hours as much as you can and from home as much as you can. If your kids are night-owls, you may be able to work early in the day and still spend a good bit of time with them in the late afternoon, early evening. If your kids are early-birds, look for evening/night hours to work. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps a whole lot to think hard about priorities and what you mean by &quot;really need to work&quot;. I know from my periods of unemployment that my kids are happier to have me home than when I&#39;m working more and buying more fun things. They&#39;d rather have me than a Wii - and that&#39;s heartening! Unschooling needs resources, but not necessarily *financial* resources. Parents are often the best resources a child can have ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling when both parents work","postDate":"1311154835","msgId":47039,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCQkI4Q0UxLTBEMzQtNEQ3Qy1CNjQwLTlENzY3NUFBMjMzOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGowNTU5MytrOWtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGowNTU5MytrOWtsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47038,"nextInTopic":47040,"prevInTime":47038,"nextInTime":47040,"topicId":47038,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
