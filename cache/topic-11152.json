There is also something called Music <br/>\n<br/>\nTogether which is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... to answer your question more broadly: I wouldn&#39;t stay at <br/>\n<br/>\nsomething they blatantly don&#39;t like, but I might possibly try <br/>\n<br/>\nanother avenue to experience, say, music, that they WOULD like. That <br/>\n<br/>\nmay or may not mean a different class.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am a music teacher and I used to teach MusikGarten.  I agree it is<br/>\nbetter than Kindermusic.  Ironically, they were written by the same people.<br/>\nKindermusic got sold and watered down while the owner worked on MusikGarten<br/>\nto make the program more what she wanted.  I think it can be a fun class but<br/>\nI will say, making music at home with your kids, dancing and singing is way<br/>\nmore important than going to any class.  If you are shy about music or not<br/>\nconfident a MusikGarten or other mommy and me type class can help bring the<br/>\nmom out of her shell and give her some confidence that may open up more<br/>\nopportunities for music at home.  This is the real benefit of the classes<br/>\nIM(not so Humble)O.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11167,"nextTopicId":11175}}
