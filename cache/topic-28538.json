My dad was a UF business professor who as a sideline spent 25 years slowly developing 80 acres of beautiful lake lots near our family homestead in the SC/NC/GA triangle. I remember learning from his patient explanations about contracting for options to purchase, rather than contracting for purchase directly. You would pay a small percentage of the total cost to temporarily reserve the opportunity to buy it without having to make the full commitment until you were ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember it so clearly because I remember how hard it was for me as a teenager to wrap my mind around the idea that it wasn&#39;t a waste of money to buy the opportunity but then not take it. I also felt like it was wasteful to put in the option purchase on top of the price if it *did* lead to purchase later. It&#39;s not inituitive until you consciously come to value what my dad in all matters personal and professional, literally called &quot;keeping your options open.&quot; :)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie here","postDate":"1310572911","msgId":46987,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCNDhCQUE1MDhBODQ5M0Q5NEVBOTMxQTI5Nzk1QUQyQEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEY1NzYxNjZBLUIxMDQtNEM4MC1CNUY3LTEyMERBQTg0MTY5NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMTA0ODc0NjcuMjYwOTcuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxMzAxMDYubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTMxMDQ5MDU0NC43NzI1OC5ZYWhvb01haWxSQ0B3ZWI4NzMxMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxGNTc2MTY2QS1CMTA0LTRDODAtQjVGNy0xMjBEQUE4NDE2OTZAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":46986,"nextInTopic":46988,"prevInTime":46986,"nextInTime":46988,"topicId":28538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: Joyce Fetteroll Sent: Wednesday, July 13, 2011 4:17 AM To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie here ...

They don&#39;t have the experience with the world to  <br/>\nbe able to understand what something will be like before they&#39;ve tried  <br/>\nit. Even adults can&#39;t be sure! But you *choosing* not to quit an  <br/>\nactivity because of a personal value isn&#39;t at all the same as your  <br/>\nhusband not allowing you to quit because of his personal values.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t need to be taught an adult view of money. Their view of  <br/>\nmoney will slowly change with age -- because they&#39;re getting older,  <br/>\nnot because someone&#39;s teaching them.<br/>\n<br/>\nLive your values. Use them as guides to help you make decisions for  <br/>\nyourself and them. If &quot;not wasting money&quot; is important to you, find  <br/>\nopportunities to explore interests that cost little or nothing. Ask if  <br/>\nthe kids can try a class before they sign up. (Because, honestly, the  <br/>\nleader doesn&#39;t want kids who are attending against their will any more  <br/>\nthan the kids do!) If *you* decide to spend the money, that&#39;s your  <br/>\nchoice. The burden of following your definition of &quot;not wasting money&quot;  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be moved to their shoulders.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps, you can look at paying for a class as buying an  <br/>\nopportunity to explore and not as x minutes of classroom time. Their  <br/>\nexplorations may lead them to discover that there are certain  <br/>\npersonalities they don&#39;t get along with, that reality sometimes  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t match their imaginings, that that aspect of life isn&#39;t as  <br/>\ninteresting as they expected, and many many other things. They are  <br/>\nlearning about life and more about what the like and dislike about the  <br/>\nworld and more about who they are whether they complete something or  <br/>\nnot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that when I knee jerk said of course she had to go to class  <br/>\nthat day, that she *really* didn&#39;t want to go, but when I caught  <br/>\nmyself and gave her the option, more often than not she chose to go.  <br/>\nWhat was important to her was being able to choose to put up with the  <br/>\nbad parts (usually a longer drive than she felt like that day) to get  <br/>\nto the good parts.

School has never really worked for my<br/>\nson.  He is mostly nonverbal so he is bullied because he is different and<br/>\nthe school seems to not be able to do anything about it. All they do in his<br/>\nclass is watch movies, like The Exorcist or he sleeps. He was put off the<br/>\nschool bus in a strange neighborhood because another student was picking on<br/>\nhim and he got upset. No one even called me. I found out when my younger son<br/>\ngot home and called me. I had to drive around for an hour before I found<br/>\nhim. I started driving him to and from school after that. Thank goodness I<br/>\nhave an understanding employer. The last straw came two weeks when a kid<br/>\nstarted taking my sons&#39;s lunch. The teacher told my son he should just beat<br/>\nthe other kid up and the principals idea of a resolution is to send my son<br/>\nhome early everyday before lunch. My child who already has enough challenges<br/>\nbecame more and more depressed until last week he was actually suicidal. We<br/>\ntook him in for an emergency appointment with his psychiatrist and she told<br/>\nme that she really thought we needed to find an alternative to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had researched more traditional homeschooling, but my son was really not<br/>\nexcited about the idea and I felt uncertain that I&#39;d be able to do it as a<br/>\nsingle mom who has to work full time.Then I happened on unschooling.<br/>\nActually my sister homeschools her kids and I had asked her some questions<br/>\nabout the laws in our state and she mentioned that some parents called<br/>\nthemselves unschoolers which she though sounded crazy, lol.<br/>\nI started looking into it right away but at first dismissed it because I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t understand it at first and thought it wasn&#39;t legal in my state<br/>\nanyway. With the most recent developments with my son&#39;s depression, I knew<br/>\nwe had to do something so I did more checking and found that I CAN unschool<br/>\nin my state. I talked to my son and he was actually excited about the idea.<br/>\nThat in itself was proof that we were headed in the right direction. So I am<br/>\nstill researching but I have also decided that we are going to do this. I am<br/>\nplanning to have him finish this year, which is only 4 more weeks and then<br/>\nwithdraw him for next year. I&#39;ll have the summer to prepare and while I<br/>\nunderstand I may not be able to learn it ALL in that amount of time, I am<br/>\nstill planning to go ahead.

I think we&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen doing unschooling without really knowing what to call it since they<br/>\nwere born.  Neither of the kids has ever been in preschool or commercial<br/>\nchildcare.  When I had to go back to work they went to stay with my best<br/>\nfriend.  We have done some Kindermusic (just because they think it&#39;s fun)<br/>\nand my son takes Taekwondo, because he loves it, but that&#39;s about the most<br/>\nstructured we get.  We read alot.  As I suspect most kids do, they like to<br/>\nmemorize the words and say them with me.  Sometimes we lay in our bed and<br/>\ntell each other our memorized stories in dark.  We&#39;ve got easels and art<br/>\nsupplies, blocks, dolls, dinosaurs, games, you name it, scattered around the<br/>\nhouse.  We try to watch them to see what has attracted their interest in any<br/>\ngiven moment and help them get the most out of it, which sometimes means<br/>\njust watching and sometimes means showing them how to take something one<br/>\nstep further.    Anyway, we started looking into school recently and then<br/>\nsomehow I stumbled across this concept on the net so here I am trying to<br/>\nfind my way though.   We had a natural birth in a hospital for my son<br/>\n(because I was too nervous to do unattended and too broke to have a midwife)<br/>\nand a home waterbirth with my daughter. I tell everyone I know if you can<br/>\nget in water after transition, do it.  It was such a peaceful, empowering,<br/>\npowerful few (4 total!) hours.  Every mother and child deserve it.  We still<br/>\nhave both kids in bed with us and my daughter still likes to ride in her<br/>\nErgo when we go to the zoo or just when I&#39;m doing housework.  She likes to<br/>\nbe given a dusting cloth and usually one of her little arms is stuck over my<br/>\nshoulder dusting &quot;by mommy&#39;s head&quot;  when we clean the bookcases.  She also<br/>\nlikes to use oil on the cabinets while I&#39;m at the sink doing dishes.  Takes<br/>\n4 times as long since we have to stop at every cabinet so she can &quot;shine it<br/>\nup&quot;  but we have a great time plus I get a GREAT workout doing all that<br/>\nsquatting with her on my back. :)   Ahh, I hear her now.

We always saw the &#39;unoffical&#39; <br/>\nlearning they did almost &#39;by accident&#39; in living our lives as far more <br/>\nimportant, and certainly their teachers (and they had lots) all seemed <br/>\nto find they were more knowledgable and adaptable than the &#39;regular&#39; kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then we found &#39;homeschooling&#39; and the associated groups that exist - <br/>\nwhich seemed to fit the brief of frinding friends much better for the <br/>\ngirls than school ever had. Here they could meet with other chldren, not <br/>\nrestricted by age or postcode as school is, and make friends with people <br/>\nthey &#39;liked&#39; rather than who had been born the same year as them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we took the decision to leave school behind and venture off on our <br/>\nown. We looked at &#39;schol at home&#39; and imediatly ruled it out as not for <br/>\nus, and then looked at &#39;home schooling&#39; which still didnt really sit <br/>\nright with us. It wasnt until we came across the word, and philosophy of <br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; that we finally found &#39;where we belonged&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here we are - unschooling away. DH&#39;s latest move has brought us to <br/>\nBarcelona, Spain, which has brought challenges of its own, probably the <br/>\nmain one being the language as none of us speak Spainsh, but the lovely <br/>\nweather and wealth of new things to see is more than making up for <br/>\nthat.I hope you don&#39;t mind us as an English family in Spain joining what <br/>\nseems to be a predominatly American list, and hope to get to know more <br/>\nabout you all, and the wonderful journey that is unschooling over the <br/>\nnext few months<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this far<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128313460,"authorName":"scofield62001@yahoo.com","from":"&quot;scofield62001@...&quot; &lt;scofield62001@...&gt;","profile":"scofield62001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Newbie here","postDate":"1197749866","msgId":28544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5NDUwNy4xMTk5NC5xbUB3ZWI2MDQxMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZrMTFhMythMjBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28542,"nextInTopic":28549,"prevInTime":28543,"nextInTime":28545,"topicId":28538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Dory, Welcome to the group.
