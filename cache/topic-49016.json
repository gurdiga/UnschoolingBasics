Start with the idea that your son needs time to rest, to heal, to come about a bit. To unschool first he needs to deschool, he needs to just stop doing school, of any kind. Assigned Mythbusters watching or playing guitar or playing an &quot;educational&quot;, by your definition, card game are all instruction. They are all you telling him what is an acceptable way of learning. That&#39;s natural learning, that&#39;s you telling him what is a good thing to do versus what is a bad thing to do. Video games bad, Mythbusters good. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/getting_started/what_is_deschooling.htm%c2%a0\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/getting_started/what_is_deschooling.htm%c2%a0</a> is Pam Laricchia&#39;s review of deschooling. Read it. Read it and implement it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid that if you let him choose he will choose video games. Choose them with him. Look at the amazingness that is video games. They are seriously cool. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames/%c2%a0is\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/%c2%a0is</a> huge and fabulously full of goodness about video games.

I&#39;m afraid if I let him loose he&#39;ll just want to do that all day.  I&#39;ve thought of making up a list of things he could do from the hours of waking up until around 3 p.m. such as taking an old appliance apart, work outside in the yard or garden, watch Mythbusters or some kind of educational video, play guitar, play an educational board or card game, or do a science experiment out of one of the various books we have.
