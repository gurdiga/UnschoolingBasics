They were ages 3 months, 1 yr, 18 months, 3 yrs, and <br/>\n6 yrs when they came to live with us.  I can definitely tell the difference <br/>\nbetween the youngest 4 and the oldest.   Our oldest adopted is now 15 and <br/>\nwent thru years of problems.  But as far as the schooling portion of <br/>\nthings......... our youngest birth child was in public school until 2nd <br/>\ngrade.  We made the decision to pull him with the help of my best friend <br/>\n(who was a great unschooler....... her two are all grown up now).  When we <br/>\npulled him our other children were still foster children and the state <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t allow them to be pulled, but as soon as the papers were signed out <br/>\nthey came.   Our 15 yr old needed to be pulled long before the adoption was <br/>\nfinalized.  But our social worker was questioning our homeschooling thru the <br/>\nprocess, so when the question came up as to whether we were planning on <br/>\npulling the boys I outright lied.  Told her no,  with her line of <br/>\nquestioning I believe she would have given us an extremely hard time <br/>\nthroughout the adoption if we had told them before the ink was to be dried <br/>\nthey were coming home to stay and not return to public school.   And yes, I <br/>\nknow that was being dishonest but in the interest of the kids we did what we <br/>\nhad to do.  The other thing is when I pulled my youngest bio child I did the <br/>\nschool at home thing....... but over the years we are walking more and more <br/>\ndown the unschooling path.  Its taken us awhile to get here but I try real <br/>\nhard not to let that public school thinking I was brought up in sneak in and <br/>\ntake over :)<br/>\nIf there is anything else I help with (or you just need to vent or question) <br/>\ndrop me a line.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol (in Maine)  where is raining like heck & scaring our daughter, she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like all the lightning & thunder<br/>\n *******************<br/>\nSubject: Re: Adoptive parents/unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some questions for you folks who&#39;ve adopted older kids.

That was in Oct. of 2003. <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have other children before them so no, we weren&#39;t <br/>\nunschooling at that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAdopting older children (any child over the age of 2 is considered <br/>\nolder) is not easy but in the end it can work out to be the most <br/>\nrewarding thing you&#39;ve done with your life. These children have been <br/>\nthrough things (in their biological home and/or in foster care) that <br/>\nwe only have nightmares about and it changes them. When their abuse <br/>\nand neglect happens during an age span where major development, they <br/>\ndon&#39;t develop as they they should have. One of the major issues we <br/>\ndeal with is attachment disorder. <br/>\n<br/>\nRemoving them from school is the best thing we&#39;ve done for them. My <br/>\nchildren (mostly the older two) are very easily influenced and <br/>\npursuaded plus, having attachment disorder makes them &quot;trust&quot; <br/>\nstrangers more than us so having them in school was not helping them <br/>\nheal. They thrive on routine and knowing what is expected of them. <br/>\nWe have to actually re-parent them. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll have to decide what you CAN&#39;T handle if you decide to adopt <br/>\nolder kids. We knew that we couldn&#39;t handle animal abuse or severe <br/>\nviolence and we told the case workers that. My older two children <br/>\ndeal with the effects of sexual abuse and we have to parent them <br/>\naccordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not all bad though! LOL I just believe in going into this with <br/>\nopen eyes. My kids are healing and making progress every day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have an active and private online community for adoptive parents <br/>\n(and also those who want to adopt) if you&#39;re interested in more <br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Adoptive parents/unschooling","postDate":"1122383636","msgId":5846,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMC42NWY2YmI2LjMwMTc5MTE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5847,"prevInTime":5845,"nextInTime":5847,"topicId":5846,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have some questions for you folks who ve adopted older kids.
