He says that a lot of time a true sense of fear is based on tips we&#39;ve noticed subconsciously but haven&#39;t had time to process. Protecting the Gift is specifically about helping our children. Also includes lots of tips on indicators that someone really may have bad intentions and teaching our children what to do if they do get lost. (Don&#39;t look for a police officer or someone in uniform -- look for a woman, especially a mom with children, whom you feel comfortable with.

Much of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1018694242\">A great book on this topic is &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; by Gavin deBecker<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ***<br/>\n  I read this book a few months ago, and I found it really had a lot to offer.  Much of what he said, I&#39;d heard growing up -- about your own instincts, fear being a gift, seeking out a Mom for help if you&#39;re lost, etc.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My experience is colored by two different parts of my life.  When I was a teen, my Mom was a volunteer counselor with the Rape Crisis Center -- get a phone call middle of the night, meet the &#39;victim&#39; and accompany her thru the hospital and police report kinda thing.  In the process, I heard a lot about staying safe -- park under a light, the &#39;don&#39;t talk to strangers&#39; rule isn&#39;t just for kids, etc.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Twenty years later I found myself Mom to a fearless wanderer (Will) who got lost repeatedly -- at the mall at Xmas time, around the neighborhood (the first time he wandered off from the babysitter&#39;s patio, he was 18 mos old).  I tried telling him to never leave my side -- that didn&#39;t work well at all. LOL  Will was the kind of kid who didn&#39;t really talk to strangers. He barely spoke to adults we knew.  Will would get lost looking at something and fall behind, or wander away from the playset to see a pretty bird, then get lost because he was disoriented (because he hadn&#39;t paid attention to where he was going as he followed his whim). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  What finally worked for us was &#39;arming&#39; him -- by the time he was 30 mos old he could recite his name, my name, our phone number and address, and his grandma&#39;s name and phone number, too.  He knew not to seek out a policeman or security guard, but to find a Mom.  To call out Mom if he felt he was in immediate danger, because when a child screams Mom, every woman in the place spins to look around for the sound (even those who didn&#39;t bring their child along).  To never get in a car with a stranger.  To never go with someone who didn&#39;t know our family &#39;safe word.&#39;  That I&#39;d never send someone to get him at school, the park -- anywhere really -- who didn&#39;t know this word.  To complicate matters, my ex and his mother had expressed interest in seeing Will, but weren&#39;t safe people, so I really felt we needed a safe word.  Not everyone will need a safe word, but for kids who are away from Mom -- school, etc -- they&#39;re good to have.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyway, I really recommend this book. It&#39;s not easy to read -- he lays out some scary stories -- but I think he shares important information.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!

My son, 8, broke off and ran to the tank that housed the painted turtles.

This guy the kids just met takes off the tank lid, pulls out a turtle and offers it to her son?  I don&#39;t know -- something about it just feels odd to me.  Sure, this guy isn&#39;t a danger to her kids when Mom is there, but what about someday in a few week or months when her son runs into this man at the park/store/sidewalk and maybe Mom isn&#39;t around?  Now that guy isn&#39;t technically a &#39;stranger&#39; -- but does anyone know how safe he is, really?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  <br/>\n(Ren) We interact with strangers every single day. I think kids raised in a healthy enviroment, who are given information, will pick up on truly &quot;strange&quot; behavior. It&#39;s really harmful to children to be fearful of people that are behaving kindly, as an automatic reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  And I think that guy&#39;s behavior was truly strange.  I don&#39;t think all adults who are nice to my kids are pervs, but this guy&#39;s actions made me feel like he was trying to create something with this kid.  He catches up with the kid at the turtle tank, after kid has left Mom&#39;s side, and breaks the rules to give the kid a special moment -- all before Mom can get there.  It would bother me.  It feels like he&#39;s building trust or sharing a secret.  Unless he was a really, really benign person it would concern me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Going over to the man, dialoguing with him, discussing why the store doesn&#39;t want the turtle handled etc....might be better than feeding some fear of strangers. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I agree that going over to the man and talking with him about it is good, too.  And, for me, it would be about the vibe he gave off.  Is there a sign posted saying it&#39;s not okay to reach in and get a turtle?  Did this man know that, and was he knowingly breaking the rules just to be friendly with my kid?  If the answer to both those questions is yes, then I&#39;m not comfortable with that man and would talk to my kids about my feelings after we&#39;d left the store.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If the rule isn&#39;t posted and this man was just being helpful -- and if he gave off energy that felt totally safe (not all strangers give off bad vibes, but some do) -- I&#39;d be less uncomfortable.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We also talk with many adults in public places -- Andy is the most socially unafraid child on the planet and will strike up a conversation with anyone and everyone we meet.  I haven&#39;t told the boys that all adults are suspect (because that&#39;s not true), but some adults do harm kids, and it&#39;s not always easy to know which ones are safe and which ones aren&#39;t.  If it were, there&#39;d no victims.  While Andy will talk to virtually everyone, he&#39;s not very good at social cues and I&#39;m not sure how well-developed his personal radar is just yet, so I stay close. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss an email again!<br/>\nYahoo!

His other book is &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot;, so now you know what the gift is:-)  Anyway, his books are about learning to trust our instincts -- not being fearful of everything and everyone but also not talking ourselves out of fear when we do genuinely experience it.  He says that a lot of time a true sense of fear is based on tips we&#39;ve noticed subconsciously but haven&#39;t had time to process.  Protecting the Gift is specifically about helping our children.  Also includes lots of tips on indicators that someone really may have bad intentions and teaching our children what to do if they do get lost. (Don&#39;t look for a police officer or someone in uniform -- look for a woman, especially a mom with children, whom you feel comfortable with.  Don&#39;t go with the person who comes up to you and offers help -- seek out someone to ask for help.)

If the situation was that her brother was <br/>\nallowed to drive the car and she couldn&#39;t things would be different but this is a <br/>\nturtle.

I seem to be having so many <br/>\ncrises lately and my ability to think and listen and react to the right <br/>\nhere and now is lacking (Naomi Aldort&#39;s S.A.L.V.E.).  Hindsight is <br/>\ndefinitely 20/20.  I have so many current issues that I would love to <br/>\ngleen advice from that I don&#39;t know where to begin.  ( 3 year old <br/>\nbullying 1 year old, 5 year old stamping feet declaring &quot;I won&#39;t go <br/>\nuntil I get to do blank..., 8 year old not wanting to do something the <br/>\nrest of us do)  My current read is Naomi Aldort&#39;s book which is helping <br/>\ndearly but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much advice out there for large <br/>\nfamilies.  Having a large family brings out situations like having <br/>\neveryone want to go walk the dogs together, walk to the playground, go <br/>\nbike riding, watch the same movie...you get the picture.  We seem to do <br/>\nok with the movie choices...the turn taking...but the poor dogs lose out <br/>\nwhen one out of 5 doesn&#39;t want to go out walking and I can&#39;t leave <br/>\nanyone home alone yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe previous poster earlier today, Michele (developing self control), <br/>\nhas such a similar situation as a problem I had arise yesterday I feel I <br/>\nshould start there and I&#39;ll deal with the other stuff another time.  Ok, <br/>\nyesterday...the plans were great.  It was a beautiful day, we dropped <br/>\nbooks back at the library, went to the playground, had a quick trip to <br/>\nthe grocery store and ended up at the pet store after a leasurely drive <br/>\nhome which they passed watching a movie and relaxing in the car.  All <br/>\nwas peaceful and fine.  The pet store is always a fun trip as my guys <br/>\nare animal lovers.  We were heading up to the register to check out when <br/>\na man with a husky puppy was spotted.  We have huskies so my children <br/>\nwere immediately possessed to go and pet the dog.  The man was very <br/>\nnice, we chatted, and he started following us as we made our way to the <br/>\nfront of the store.  My son, 8, broke off and ran to the tank that <br/>\nhoused the painted turtles.  The man took off the lid of the tank, <br/>\nreached in and grabbed a turtle and thrust it in my son&#39;s hand.  My son <br/>\nlooked at me and it all happened so fast I just told him that it was <br/>\ntime to put it back that I didn&#39;t think we were allowed to touch the <br/>\nturtles.  My 5 year old daughter, Claire, started to ask to hold it as <br/>\nthe man was putting it back in the tank,  but he stated that it had been <br/>\nout long enough and needed back in the water.  (I&#39;m a bit peeved that <br/>\nthe gentleman didn&#39;t ask me if my son could hold the turtle and the <br/>\nnerve he had to take the turtle out of the tank to begin with.)  Well, <br/>\nwe move along but as we near the front of the store my daughter assumes <br/>\nher stance...arms folded, head down and pouts.  I ask what was wrong.  <br/>\nShe declares, quite loudly, &quot;I want to pet the turtle!&quot;  I immediately <br/>\ndive into my head and the reading I&#39;ve been doing.  I first told her <br/>\nthat the man had no right to give Ethan the turtle without asking me and <br/>\nthat he violated the store rules by taking the turtle out in the first <br/>\nplace.  We move along a little further, but she&#39;s still pouting and <br/>\ngiving me looks to kill.  I say to her that I know she&#39;s disappointed <br/>\nthat she didn&#39;t get to hold the turtle, but that I can&#39;t do anything <br/>\nabout it because we&#39;re not allowed to.  Let&#39;s talk about it at home <br/>\n(it&#39;s late already, groceries in the car, daddy probably wondering <br/>\nwhat&#39;s taking us so long...) Well, she stamps some more declaring &quot;I&#39;m <br/>\nnot leaving until I pet the turtle!&quot;  I say, &quot;Claire, I can&#39;t leave you <br/>\nhere.  I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t get a chance to hold the turtle.  Ethan <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t have held it either but that man put it in his hands.  He took <br/>\nit back and put it back before you had a chance to hold it.&quot;  She still <br/>\nstamps and declares.  We somehow get through paying for our dog food, <br/>\nher stamping and declaring the entire time (I won&#39;t mention the amount <br/>\nof attention we had acquired by now because I tried not to care what <br/>\nothers were thinking).  We get to the door and she stops.  &quot;I WILL NOT <br/>\nLEAVE UNTIL I PET THE TURTLE!&quot;  I say, &quot;Claire, are you upset because <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t get to hold the turtle and Ethan did?&quot;  yes...and this goes <br/>\non for another 30 minutes...&quot;Claire, what else can I do?  I can&#39;t take a <br/>\nturtle out of the tank because it&#39;s against store rules?  Do you want me <br/>\nto break store rules?  I can&#39;t leave you here.&quot;  Well, we&#39;re blocking <br/>\nthe doorway, it&#39;s getting later and later and I am exhausted and don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what else to do.  She&#39;s never done this before to this extent and <br/>\nnever outside the home.  I tell her that I&#39;m very sorry but we need to <br/>\ngo home (baby, 3 year old, and 8 year old are beyond ready to go...) I <br/>\ntell her we can talk more in the car and at home.  Nothing I say is <br/>\nchanging anything...she repeats over and over that she won&#39;t leave until <br/>\nshe holds the turtle.  I tell her that I will have to carry her to the <br/>\ncar.  She screams no, but I don&#39;t know what else to do.  Knowing what <br/>\nI&#39;m in for (baby in sling, by the way...) I reach down and pick her up <br/>\nwith my right arm and we try and make it out to the car.  It was a <br/>\nbattle the entire way, as I knew it would be.  She is kicking me and <br/>\npinching me and yelling and screaming and the tears are pouring down my <br/>\ncheeks...this continues in the car where she won&#39;t buckle up.  I finally <br/>\nreduce to the &quot;what if we have an accident on the way home...what could <br/>\nhappen if she wasn&#39;t buckled...&quot; and she cries that she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>\nget hurt so she buckles...well...we get home and she is already calming <br/>\ndown and daddy meets us in the garage because he already called on our <br/>\nway home wondering where we were.  He is wonderful and supportive of <br/>\neverything and talks very calmly with her (meanwhile I&#39;m sobbing because <br/>\nshe has never struck at me or shown such feelings before) and she admits <br/>\nthat she just  wanted to hold the turtle because Ethan did and that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to hurt me and she was dreadfully sorry and hugged me but <br/>\nI&#39;m afraid I did a horrible wrong by carrying her to the car.
