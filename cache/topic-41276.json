But what is going to happen when it&#39;s her and 29 other kids?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nYup, that&#39;s the preschool gimmick. They&#39;re less structured and more fun than real school, but get kids and parents thinking that school is doable, is okay, and is the way to go. Then reality sets in. Its a transition for any child, but some kids transition better than others. If your dd doesn&#39;t transition easily, she&#39;s going to have a rough time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;latches onto one subject or interest and only wants to talk about/learn about that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you know that&#39;s really pretty normal kid behavior? Most parents, heck, most teachers don&#39;t know that. We&#39;re told that young children have short attention spans, when that&#39;s not necessarily true. Many kids can focus for really long periods of time, if they&#39;re allowed to. That&#39;s a wonderful trait, but its not one that schools support at all. Kids aren&#39;t Allowed to focus for more than 45 minutes at a time, and usually much less than that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If she&#39;s talking about onesies and tensies at age 4, what is a kindergarten teacher going to do with her?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she&#39;s lucky, the kindergarten teacher will gently tell her she has to stop talking, because that&#39;s not what the rest of the class is doing right now. If she&#39;s not lucky, the teacher will shame her for knowledge, tell her she&#39;s doing something she&#39;s not &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing, is doing it all wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She can write, but not well, she&#39;d rather type and use a mouse. I doubt they&#39;ll let her bring a laptop to kindergarten.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt it, too. Allowing kids to develop skills in their own time and way isn&#39;t what school is about. Mo prefered to type or use stencils for years. Even now she&#39;d mostly rather type than print. Its expecially common for 5&6 yos to have an aversion to writing - they instinctively know their hands and brains aren&#39;t ready, yet. School tells them their instincts are wrong, that they should do this thing over and over and that doing so will make them better at it. You know what? Kids who are allowed to honor those instincts develop better penmanship at about the same age as their schooled fellows. Its not the practice that does it, its the developmental process. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;By then I fear she&#39;ll be bitter and a hard-core class troublemaker just from boredom.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nOr worse, she&#39;ll &quot;dumb down&quot; to fit in. Girls tend to be more likely to do that *and* school praises girls for being quiet and inoffensive. Even strong minded girls can learn to play dumb for the sake of fitting in. Ask around the stong minded women you know - you might be surprised at how many were &quot;good girls&quot; in school. I certainly was. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Would it be considered truancy to not enroll her in kindy - do I need to sign up with some kind of curriculum? And if so, is there some kind of curriculum that is very flexible? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll want to check with local homeschool groups for specific laws and how they&#39;re applied, but homeschooling is legal in every state and unschooling is technically a kind of homeschool. Unschooling is also the Most flexible curriculum there is, one might say, although most radical unschoolers (like me) don&#39;t consider it an educational method at all, but a whole way of living. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts a Great way to live! You get to look at your children as whole, wonderful people and help them find out what they love to do. It won&#39;t look like school. Some days it won&#39;t even look like reading or skip counting, it will look like playing on the swings and snuggling on the couch and coloring - and yet every moment of those things are full of learning. Children really are learning all the time, regardless of what they&#39;re doing! Unschoolers learn to look at the world via the child&#39;s perspective and see learning as fun and effortless and magical. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;it occurred to me that why can&#39;t *I* be her tutor<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can be something even better! You can be her resource coordinator, her faciliator, her consultant, her partner and her friend. Really really. You don&#39;t have to worry about &quot;staying a step ahead&quot; so you can teach her, you just need to learn to take her seriously and help her find resources - like the internet, or libraries, or other people with special skills and knowledge. You don&#39;t need to &quot;keep her on track&quot; you can trust that she knows when she needs to go whole-hog and focus on what she&#39;s doing and when she needs to flit from one thing to another. Best of all, you don&#39;t ever have to worry that she&#39;ll come to hate learning, the way so many kids do in school, and even with traditional homeschooling. Unschooled kids get to enjoy learning all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep your girl home and let her be herself, her whole self, unfettered by school. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9358072,"authorName":"Rachel Lowder","from":"Rachel Lowder &lt;lowderra@...&gt;","profile":"lowderra","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: legality of unschooling in VA","postDate":"1252541843","msgId":41281,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2MDU1My44NjAzNC5xbUB3ZWIxMTAyMTgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg4OTczbCtsam1sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41280,"nextInTopic":41282,"prevInTime":41280,"nextInTime":41282,"topicId":41276,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren, thank you so very much.

My oldest went into early intervention at 17 months because she was NOT talking at all, no eye contact, didn&#39;t play with other kids, wouldn&#39;t initiate hugs, etc. She did well, entered spec ed preschool, did even better, blah blah blah......~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds similar to one of my children. He outgrew many of those traits without therapy and without a diagnosis. For a lot of these kids, they&#39;re on a hugely different developmental schedule and mainstream thinking is to pathologize everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ She has a school label of autism, we are in the process of securing an official medical diagnosis, autism runs in my family....but she&#39;s seemed to adapt to it well and is highly functional and seems happy and bright.~<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy and bright is good. School can take that away, especially from children/people who don&#39;t fit the square peg of school.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Public school is great right?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic school is damaging to the spirit, damaging to curiosity and self-confidence and joy of learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I&#39;m unconvinced she&#39;ll mainstream well. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMainstreaming is the opposite of what I want for my children. I want spirits that positively light the world on fire with their uniqueness.I want children who TRUST themselves more than some institution or &quot;expert&quot;. I want children who feel free to BE themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ But what is going to happen when it&#39;s her and 29 other kids?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMore troubling,what could happen when she&#39;d being formed into something she isn&#39;t? When she&#39;s told that the world as she&#39;s sees it is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;less than&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I doubt they&#39;ll let her bring a laptop to kindergarten. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just struck on something really important. Not the part about control and what they will allow, but the fact that the average home in today&#39;s world has more access to information than any previous generation could even imagine! If you have the internet, what would you need a school for?? <br/>\n<br/>\n~~The public school, while full of nice people, say they don&#39;t pull out for more advanced work until 1st grade. And they won&#39;t even consider a gifted program until 3rd grade.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Gifted&quot; can be just as damaging as any other label. Gifted programs can&#39;t help a child be more fully themselves. Freedom to explore the world in your own way and time is more enriching than any program any school can think up.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ And her sister is shaping up to be an early reader (knows all her letters, and a couple of simple words) and interested in counting (she just turned 3) and the way she&#39;s into everything~~<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly reading isn&#39;t better or more desirable than late reading. Pushing kids to do certain things over others, might keep them from activities which are actually more important for their life journey. One can read when one is ready. Not before then. Try not to value reading above playing in the dirt, or computers or anything else they might want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~What can I legally do? ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling is legal in every state. Register her as a homeschooler and walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ until she is &quot;old enough&quot; to be in a class where she can be pulled out for more advanced work?~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Advanced&quot; schoolwork is mostly twaddle. Living an interesting life is much more fun....and the learning just happens naturally. Think about it, when YOU are engaged in something, are you learning? When you get excited about something (like unschooling) how do you learn what you need? Should we all &quot;school&quot; you and make you take a test to prove you&#39;re learning about unschooling? ;) Tests and advanced work can really shut down the learning process. Joy and excitement lead to great things.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~And if so, is there some kind of curriculum that is very flexible? A typical kindergarten curriculum she could probably complete in about 2 weeks or less, and why blow the money on stuff she already knows?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about spending money on things she wants and likes? Spend money doing things together that you all enjoy! Spend money on your lives, forget curriculum. Why take someone else&#39;s prepackaged agenda and try to fit it?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I welcome all info and tips. I&#39;ll be honest and say upfront that I&#39;ve never been a big fan of homeschooling - but she&#39;s just so different and so is her sister - I&#39;m not really seeing any other options.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is an amazing lifestyle for those that really understand natural learning, being present for their children (and themselves) and their unique unfolding. It&#39;s an opportunity to live as if school did not exist. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I stumbled upon unschooling while looking into hiring her a private tutor - then it occurred to me that why can&#39;t *I* be her tutor. I work part-time as a nurse, and working 3-11 shifts (mostly on the weekends) is pretty conducive to doing this I would think.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like it might be a great fit. Instead of being any kind of &quot;tutor&quot; be her friend, her parent her partner.

My oldest went into early intervention at 17 months because she was NOT talking at all, no eye contact, didn&#39;t play with other kids, wouldn&#39;t initiate hugs, etc. She did well, entered spec ed preschool, did even better, blah blah blah......~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds similar to one of my children. He outgrew many of those traits without therapy and without a diagnosis. For a lot of these kids, they&#39;re on a hugely different developmental schedule and mainstream thinking is to pathologize everything.<br/>\n <br/>\n~ She has a school label of autism, we are in the process of securing an official medical diagnosis, autism runs in my family....but she&#39;s seemed to adapt to it well and is highly functional and seems happy and bright.~<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy and bright is good. School can take that away, especially from children/people who don&#39;t fit the square peg of school.<br/>\n <br/>\n~~Public school is great right?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nPublic school is damaging to the spirit, damaging to curiosity and self-confidence and joy of learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n~~I&#39;m unconvinced she&#39;ll mainstream well. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMainstreaming is the opposite of what I want for my children. I want spirits that positively light the world on fire with their uniqueness.I want children who TRUST themselves more than some institution or &quot;expert&quot;. I want children who feel free to BE themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ But what is going to happen when it&#39;s her and 29 other kids?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nMore troubling,what could happen when she&#39;d being formed into something she isn&#39;t? When she&#39;s told that the world as she&#39;s sees it is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;less than&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I doubt they&#39;ll let her bring a laptop to kindergarten.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just struck on something really important. Not the part about control and what they will allow, but the fact that the average home in today&#39;s world has more access to information than any previous generation could even imagine! If you have the internet, what would you need a school for?? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~The public school, while full of nice people, say they don&#39;t pull out for more advanced work until 1st grade. And they won&#39;t even consider a gifted program until 3rd grade.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Gifted&quot; can be just as damaging as any other label. Gifted programs can&#39;t help a child be more fully themselves. Freedom to explore the world in your own way and time is more enriching than any program any school can think up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~~ And her sister is shaping up to be an early reader (knows all her letters, and a couple of simple words) and interested in counting (she just turned 3) and the way she&#39;s into everything~~<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly reading isn&#39;t better or more desirable than late reading. Pushing kids to do certain things over others, might keep them from activities which are actually more important for their life journey. One can read when one is ready. Not before then. Try not to value reading above playing in the dirt, or computers or anything else they might want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~What can I legally do? ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling is legal in every state. Register her as a homeschooler and walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ until she is &quot;old enough&quot; to be in a class where she can be pulled out for more advanced work?~~<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Advanced&quot; schoolwork is mostly twaddle. Living an interesting life is much more fun....and the learning just happens naturally. Think about it, when YOU are engaged in something, are you learning? When you get excited about something (like unschooling) how do you learn what you need? Should we all &quot;school&quot; you and make you take a test to prove you&#39;re learning about unschooling? ;) Tests and advanced work can really shut down the learning process. Joy and excitement lead to great things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~And if so, is there some kind of curriculum that is very flexible? A typical kindergarten curriculum she could probably complete in about 2 weeks or less, and why blow the money on stuff she already knows?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about spending money on things she wants and likes? Spend money doing things together that you all enjoy! Spend money on your lives, forget curriculum. Why take someone else&#39;s prepackaged agenda and try to fit it?<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I welcome all info and tips. I&#39;ll be honest and say upfront that I&#39;ve never been a big fan of homeschooling - but she&#39;s just so different and so is her sister - I&#39;m not really seeing any other options.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is an amazing lifestyle for those that really understand natural learning, being present for their children (and themselves) and their unique unfolding. It&#39;s an opportunity to live as if school did not exist. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I stumbled upon unschooling while looking into hiring her a private tutor - then it occurred to me that why can&#39;t *I* be her tutor. I work part-time as a nurse, and working 3-11 shifts (mostly on the weekends) is pretty conducive to doing this I would think.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like it might be a great fit. Instead of being any kind of &quot;tutor&quot; be her friend, her parent her partner.

I listened to the school BECAUSE i had no choice....they told me it<br/>\nwas there decision not mine how my son would be treated at school and what<br/>\nsubjects he would or would not take my opinion ended at the IEP which I did<br/>\nnot even get to write....but not the point or what I wanted to say...my son<br/>\nwent to Kinder and he did OK till he got hurt then he shut down no one knew<br/>\nwhat happened to him and I ended up in an emergency room in the middle of<br/>\nthe night with a 5 year old with SEVERE chest wall bruising and a CPS<br/>\nworking standing over my should reading to snatch my son and his 5 siblings<br/>\nsitting in the lobby....it was the absolute worst mistake I have ever made<br/>\nwith him letting him go to a public school.  We immediately brought him home<br/>\nnot to homeschool but to virtual school because my husband didn&#39;t think I<br/>\nwould be structured enough to teach our children then after 3 years of that<br/>\nand him seeing how it was not working we are unschooling.  I am not pushing<br/>\nfor any particular way to educate your child but be very careful if you do<br/>\nlet your daughter go to school because they are sneaky and most likely will<br/>\nnot give your child any help then they will be labeled the trouble maker and<br/>\nthat sticks.  Sorry if this sounded harsh it was just a really troubling and<br/>\nscary time in our sons life and we fought like hell and then realized we<br/>\nwere fighting for nothing at all really.<br/>\nJacque<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Sep 9, 2009 at 9:33 AM, lowderra &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lowderra@...\">lowderra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I posted this on another board and a lady named SandraDodd kindly directed<br/>\n&gt; me here.
