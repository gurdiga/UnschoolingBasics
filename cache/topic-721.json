My first thought was hell yes I&#39;d go to jail! Then I<br/>\nthought about why I had that gut reaction.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat person was me and the thought behind it was; how can I be there for my<br/>\nkids if I&#39;m sitting in jail?  Who&#39;s giving your child a safe place to smoke<br/>\npot if your in jail and he, assuming he/she is under 18 is sent to a foster<br/>\nhome?  In Vermont that&#39;s what happens,you lose your home, your freedom AND<br/>\nyour kids.  That to me hardly seems worth it.  How can I live with my kids?<br/>\nIt is a very precarious situation and not just a; I smoked pot when I was a<br/>\nkid answer.  There is more to consider here(Vermont) than in many states.<br/>\n    I&#39;m torn on this one, because I&#39;ve seen pot, yes pot, ruin a few lives.<br/>\nNot pot itself, but the abuse of it and then the eventual use of harder<br/>\ndrugs to maintain the high.  My personal experience may not have been yours.<br/>\nI used pot, but stopped after attending a party where it was laced.  I can<br/>\nsee both sides to this story.  Would I have been safer at home, yes! Could I<br/>\nhave bought pot for home use that was laced, yes.....<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy can&#39;t their be a compromise like some parents have with drinking kids.<br/>\nUsing it is fine, but don&#39;t drive under the influence.  I&#39;ll pick you up<br/>\nregardless of time or place won&#39;t complain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it, I&#39;m saying there must be a better alternative<br/>\nthan losing my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[G&M Contracting Inc., Kenneth Gillilan]<br/>\n -----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Valerie [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:valerie@...\">valerie@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, June 15, 2004 11:36 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] pot smoking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bravo to Kelly for handling the pot smoking the way she is!
