He was soooooo <br/>\noutgoing and really didn&#39;t have the skills to back that up. He just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly understand all the expectations and nuances and, <br/>\nbecause of his personality, wasn&#39;t able to stop and watch and work <br/>\nall that out *before* diving in, socially. So we had lots of <br/>\ndisasters. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing right at his side to help him negotiate group situations was <br/>\nwhat helped him the most. That meant we couldn&#39;t go to the kind of <br/>\nsettings where kids were expected to be parted from their parents - <br/>\neither classes or social events where kids would all &quot;pack&quot; together <br/>\nresulted in, at best, disappointment. We also couldn&#39;t go to adult <br/>\nsocial gatherings unless we had a plan for an adult being at Ray&#39;s <br/>\nside all night - which meant less adult social time, for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we stayed home alot. That gave him the opportunity to mature and <br/>\nlearn some good social skills, like how to participate in <br/>\nconversations, rather than dominating them. That took time, though, <br/>\nand a lot of listening to him *first* so he could get those big <br/>\nattention needs met and *then* be able to listen to someone else. <br/>\nWe&#39;d set up play dates with individual kids now and then, but more <br/>\noften with individual teens or adults so there wasn&#39;t the issue of <br/>\nRay steamrolling over another child - that can be a real problem with <br/>\nextroverted kids, one I&#39;ve been on both sides of, since Mo&#39;s a <br/>\nstaunch introvert. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I cannot stand the isolation. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a separate issue. Its vitally important that you see it as a <br/>\nseparate issue, too. Find ways to meet your own need to socialize <br/>\n*without* your extroverted dd. Find some adult activities - join a <br/>\nclub, take a class (or teach one!), organize a &quot;mom&#39;s night out,&quot; <br/>\njoin the local city council, get your hair done twice a week, <br/>\nWhatever you need to do to get your needs met. Just don&#39;t expect to <br/>\nbe able to bring a very outgoing child along with you, unless you <br/>\nalso bring another adult (or teen) expressly to hang out with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m not providing her with enough...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enough what? Social time? Under the circumstances, she&#39;ll get more <br/>\nquality social time one on one than in any kind of group - but most <br/>\nespecially than any kind of class or lecture. Are you worried that <br/>\nshe&#39;s not being &quot;exposed&quot; to enough ideas, knowledge, opportunities? <br/>\nRobin tossed out some &quot;strewing&quot; links, I think - that&#39;s a good place <br/>\nto start looking for ideas. Another place to look for ideas is to <br/>\nyour dd, herself - what sorts of things interest her? Then start <br/>\nthinking about how Adults with those interests find friends to share <br/>\nthem. So maybe classes aren&#39;t a good choice for awhile, what are <br/>\nother ways people in real life connect with one another? If you can <br/>\ntoss out some examples of your dd&#39;s interests, I&#39;m sure some of us <br/>\ncan help you brainstorm. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":256960212,"authorName":"Janna Beth Ryan","from":"Janna Beth Ryan &lt;jannabethryan@...&gt;","profile":"jannabethryan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: library & school programs & unschooling","postDate":"1233926972","msgId":38206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3ODQwNC40ODg5MC5xbUB3ZWIzNjQwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38205,"nextInTopic":38207,"prevInTime":38205,"nextInTime":38207,"topicId":38172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for sharing.  I realized that when you shared my step-daughter was the same way...I have 2 daughters who have similar ways of being in the world. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-987260134\">Thanks for sharing.  I realized that when you shared my step-daughter was the same way...I have 2 daughters who have similar &quot;ways of being&quot; in the world.  My daughter also sings all day wherever we are.  Not something you see everyday and I love it.. <br/>\nJanna<br/>\nRe: library & school programs & unschooling <br/>\nPosted by: &quot;Betj&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bkind28@...\">bkind28@...</a>   bkind28 <br/>\nWed Feb 4, 2009 6:17 am (PST) <br/>\nI have never conformed.

How old is <br/>\nyour daughter?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been in this situation LOTS of times. My son (now 6) is always <br/>\nanimated and interrupting and I used to cringe when attending these <br/>\nthings. He always did the very thing (and still does to a lesser <br/>\ndegree) that your daughter did. And she may always (though less than <br/>\nnow) do those things because of her personality. .she is just so <br/>\nexcited to share that it may come across as &quot;rude&quot; or whatever. Even <br/>\nif you had been sitting next to her the &quot;disruption&quot; would have still <br/>\noccured..only this time it would have been YOU telling her to raise <br/>\nher hand, be quiet, wait your turn etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned to put my son in the LAST row so I could always get to him <br/>\neasily. beforehand I would explain the rules of waiting to share <br/>\nuntil the end unless the teacher asked something then raise his hand. <br/>\nI also explained to him that I would put my hand on him (shoulder <br/>\nleg) to help him remember. I still have to walk over and place my <br/>\nhand on him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that I am disappointed in the library staff if they are <br/>\nnot working with you by being kind when you go in, thank goodness we <br/>\nhave a great library staff!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that if I were on stage I would get tomatoes thrown at me <br/>\nfor the next part!:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my job to raise my son. this is who my son is. Yes, I want him <br/>\nto fit into society by knowing the rules (raising hand etc) but in <br/>\nhonesty, I don&#39;t expect him to. I am not sure he will ever &quot;conform&quot; <br/>\nnor do I want him to. But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>\nprograms because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>\npeople (kids teachers etc) expect of him. If he becomes too much of <br/>\nan annoyance they will let me know and have him removed..until next <br/>\ntime. And there will be a next time. and next time I will still <br/>\nexplain the rules and hope he remembers a little better. And if the <br/>\nlibrarians and other kids groan when we come in..oh well. My son is <br/>\nhappy and not observing their behavior and learning something. There <br/>\nwill always be one kid in a group that is somewhat disruptive and <br/>\nmine is that kid. I am no longer embarrassed by this. I got over the <br/>\nfact that most parents were criticizing ME because it was obviously <br/>\nMY fault my kid did this because I wasn&#39;t teaching him the ground <br/>\nrules etc. that I shouldn&#39;t allow my son to &quot;ruin&quot; other kids time <br/>\netc. And another homeschooler brought something to my awareness. That <br/>\nin these situations there may always be the chance of someone&#39;s time <br/>\nbeing &quot;ruined&quot; and it was ok to let that be some other kids time! It <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to be my sons time everytime-which it would if I never <br/>\nlet him sit thru these things or play at the park etc. That I would <br/>\nbe spending a lot of my time denying things that MIGHT turn out to be <br/>\nan inconvenience to others. that these &quot;others&quot; would get over it but <br/>\nif I continued to deny these things to my son he might NOT get over <br/>\nit. I might just turn out to appear to him a parent that never let <br/>\nhim do anything-one he would eventually resent. All because I was <br/>\nembarrassed what other people thought-and for me that is what it all <br/>\nboiled down to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I ramble-sorry! In short I would say ask yourself WHY it <br/>\nbothers you and then do something about it.

So, you decided not to be the one to<br/>\ncrush her spirit and you supported her in getting what she really wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got 3 busy boys who do not sit still, listen for long periods of time,<br/>\netc. Who CARES!!! If one of them wanted to sit in on a presentation at the<br/>\nlibrary, and the other littler ones needed to be elsewhere, I would have<br/>\ndone the same thing you did. They have just as much right to be there as<br/>\nanybody in that group. It is *your* library, too, after all! The library<br/>\nstaff should be equipped to handle wigglers and fidgety kids. Especially<br/>\nwhen there are 75 of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, dad would have been helpful sitting up there beside her, but<br/>\nagain, maybe you both were giving her that little bit of feeling of &#39;look at<br/>\nme, I&#39;m such a big kid&#39;. Maybe she wanted that. You were looking in on<br/>\nher, it&#39;s not like you abandoned her there while you browsed around the<br/>\nlibrary without a thought to her needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bummer she ended up crying, but instead of thinking you need to<br/>\n&#39;solve&#39; the crying, just be there and listen to her hurts. And explain why<br/>\nthe staff may have done what they did, etc, also stating that they probably<br/>\ncould have found a nicer way (if they were rude, who knows?) Sounds like<br/>\nshe was just disappointed she didn&#39;t get to share. She probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave been able to share even if you were in there with her, which still<br/>\nwould have ended her in tears. Some experiences just don&#39;t end the way we<br/>\nhope, and that&#39;s when we, as parents, can be there with a big hug and warm<br/>\nlap. We can&#39;t always fix things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure your daughter isn&#39;t the only rowdy girl in the bunch, btw! :) I<br/>\nwas a school teacher before having children, and let me tell you, just<br/>\nbecause a kid is in school doesn&#39;t mean they all sit quietly and politely<br/>\nwaiting patiently for the teacher to call their name. NO SIR!!! The<br/>\nlibrary is used to dealing with kids of all kinds, so don&#39;t feel that they<br/>\nreally have something against your daughter. That&#39;s just your &#39;i hope<br/>\npeople don&#39;t think my kid is a pain&#39; stuff getting in the way! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, you&#39;ve witnessed them being less than polite, I&#39;d be<br/>\ntalking to someone about it. If someone at the library doesn&#39;t like dealing<br/>\nwith children, then they should find another job! Seriously, though,<br/>\nperhaps have a conversation with the person/people you feel are giving you a<br/>\nbad rap. Ask them how you can better accommodate their needs, and then also<br/>\nexplain to them that you do your best to keep your kids quiet, but they are<br/>\nKIDS, and kids will be kids. It&#39;s not like your letting them run like<br/>\nbanshees through the library, right! lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just want to say don&#39;t be so hard on yourself. You did your best,<br/>\nyou recognize there may have been another way. Live and Learn! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]Help accessing Sandra Dodd&#39;s recent chat","postDate":"1233859598","msgId":38201,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwMjQxMC43NTU3Ny5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc2MDMwNS41NTA1Mi5xbUB3ZWI1MTEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38200,"nextInTopic":38204,"prevInTime":38200,"nextInTime":38202,"topicId":38172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks very much Kelli :)   ...

All the more important to work to set our kids up for <br/>\npositive experiences whenever we can! More positive experience builds <br/>\nself confidence.

They aren&#39;t going to &quot;get it&quot; <br/>\nafter three tries or something ;) Expect to be providing this kind of <br/>\nsupport for years to come - in part bc every situation is slightly <br/>\ndifferent, even if the &quot;rules&quot; are the same. Kids are masters of <br/>\npicking up differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else you (generic you) can do (in smaller groups and one-on-<br/>\none conversation) is model is how to appologise for interrupting. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t mean to stop him, per se! But its normal, in adult <br/>\nconversation, for someone to interrupt and then say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what <br/>\nwere you saying?&quot; Its a kind of social graciousness, its just not the <br/>\nkind we usually think of when we talk about conversational etiquette. <br/>\nIf anything, its *more* polite than waiting for a break in the <br/>\nconversation - if waiting means ignoring what&#39;s being said in favor <br/>\nof watching like a cat at a mousehole for a &quot;break&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>\n&gt; programs because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>\n&gt; people (kids teachers etc) expect of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are options besides going or &quot;denying&quot;. Its important to look <br/>\nfor those options, especially with very social kids. Social <br/>\ninteraction is a big, important part of how they learn. Its a whole <br/>\nlearning style! So the more ways you can find (again, generic &quot;you&quot;)<br/>\nto offer them real life social interactions with people who share <br/>\ntheir interests, the more you set them up to learn on their own <br/>\nterms. A class or group trip may be worse than useless to an <br/>\nextroverted child if there&#39;s no opportunity for real socializing. It <br/>\nmay be no better than staying home if the only conversations they are <br/>\nable to have are with a parent. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of my kids do well with &quot;programs&quot; so we don&#39;t even look at <br/>\nthose. We look for resources outside that &quot;box&quot; if you will. How do <br/>\nadults learn things? Sometimes in classes, but very frequently from <br/>\nfriends. How do we find and make friends? In addition to being more <br/>\nhelpful in terms of learning about specific topics, its an important <br/>\nreal world skill - something you may find you have to learn right <br/>\nalongside your child, if you&#39;ve only ever met people through school, <br/>\nyourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If it is embarrassing to <br/>\n&gt; you (and I am not saying it is) then let it go and say &quot;this is my <br/>\n&gt; kid&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is so important!

He was soooooo <br/>\noutgoing and really didn&#39;t have the skills to back that up. He just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possibly understand all the expectations and nuances and, <br/>\nbecause of his personality, wasn&#39;t able to stop and watch and work <br/>\nall that out *before* diving in, socially. So we had lots of <br/>\ndisasters. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing right at his side to help him negotiate group situations was <br/>\nwhat helped him the most. That meant we couldn&#39;t go to the kind of <br/>\nsettings where kids were expected to be parted from their parents - <br/>\neither classes or social events where kids would all &quot;pack&quot; together <br/>\nresulted in, at best, disappointment. We also couldn&#39;t go to adult <br/>\nsocial gatherings unless we had a plan for an adult being at Ray&#39;s <br/>\nside all night - which meant less adult social time, for sure. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we stayed home alot. That gave him the opportunity to mature and <br/>\nlearn some good social skills, like how to participate in <br/>\nconversations, rather than dominating them. That took time, though, <br/>\nand a lot of listening to him *first* so he could get those big <br/>\nattention needs met and *then* be able to listen to someone else. <br/>\nWe&#39;d set up play dates with individual kids now and then, but more <br/>\noften with individual teens or adults so there wasn&#39;t the issue of <br/>\nRay steamrolling over another child - that can be a real problem with <br/>\nextroverted kids, one I&#39;ve been on both sides of, since Mo&#39;s a <br/>\nstaunch introvert. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I cannot stand the isolation. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a separate issue. Its vitally important that you see it as a <br/>\nseparate issue, too. Find ways to meet your own need to socialize <br/>\n*without* your extroverted dd. Find some adult activities - join a <br/>\nclub, take a class (or teach one!), organize a &quot;mom&#39;s night out,&quot; <br/>\njoin the local city council, get your hair done twice a week, <br/>\nWhatever you need to do to get your needs met. Just don&#39;t expect to <br/>\nbe able to bring a very outgoing child along with you, unless you <br/>\nalso bring another adult (or teen) expressly to hang out with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m not providing her with enough...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Enough what? Social time? Under the circumstances, she&#39;ll get more <br/>\nquality social time one on one than in any kind of group - but most <br/>\nespecially than any kind of class or lecture. Are you worried that <br/>\nshe&#39;s not being &quot;exposed&quot; to enough ideas, knowledge, opportunities? <br/>\nRobin tossed out some &quot;strewing&quot; links, I think - that&#39;s a good place <br/>\nto start looking for ideas. Another place to look for ideas is to <br/>\nyour dd, herself - what sorts of things interest her? Then start <br/>\nthinking about how Adults with those interests find friends to share <br/>\nthem. So maybe classes aren&#39;t a good choice for awhile, what are <br/>\nother ways people in real life connect with one another? If you can <br/>\ntoss out some examples of your dd&#39;s interests, I&#39;m sure some of us <br/>\ncan help you brainstorm. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287618285,"authorName":"Karen Buxcel","from":"Karen Buxcel &lt;thewildtribe@...&gt;","profile":"blackhillsdoula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] library & school programs & unschoolin","postDate":"1233766300","msgId":38187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVkYTM3ZTg0MDkwMjA0MDg1MW81YjIzOThjYWk3YjcwODYwM2I1YzllN2ZlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdtOWxmNitmMzJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdtOWxmNitmMzJnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38185,"nextInTopic":38189,"prevInTime":38186,"nextInTime":38188,"topicId":38172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Janna, You made the best call you could make in that moment, in that situation.

If one of them wanted to sit in on a presentation at the<br/>\nlibrary, and the other littler ones needed to be elsewhere, I would have<br/>\ndone the same thing you did.  They have just as much right to be there as<br/>\nanybody in that group.  It is *your* library, too, after all!  The library<br/>\nstaff should be equipped to handle wigglers and fidgety kids.  Especially<br/>\nwhen there are 75 of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, dad would have been helpful sitting up there beside her, but<br/>\nagain, maybe you both were giving her that little bit of feeling of &#39;look at<br/>\nme, I&#39;m such a big kid&#39;.  Maybe she wanted that.  You were looking in on<br/>\nher, it&#39;s not like you abandoned her there while you browsed around the<br/>\nlibrary without a thought to her needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a bummer she ended up crying, but instead of thinking you need to<br/>\n&#39;solve&#39; the crying, just be there and listen to her hurts.  And explain why<br/>\nthe staff may have done what they did, etc, also stating that they probably<br/>\ncould have found a nicer way (if they were rude, who knows?)  Sounds like<br/>\nshe was just disappointed she didn&#39;t get to share.  She probably wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave been able to share even if you were in there with her, which still<br/>\nwould have ended her in tears.  Some experiences just don&#39;t end the way we<br/>\nhope, and that&#39;s when we, as parents, can be there with a big hug and warm<br/>\nlap.  We can&#39;t always fix things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure your daughter isn&#39;t the only rowdy girl in the bunch, btw! :)  I<br/>\nwas a school teacher before having children, and let me tell you, just<br/>\nbecause a kid is in school doesn&#39;t mean they all sit quietly and politely<br/>\nwaiting patiently for the teacher to call their name.  NO SIR!!!  The<br/>\nlibrary is used to dealing with kids of all kinds, so don&#39;t feel that they<br/>\nreally have something against your daughter.  That&#39;s just your &#39;i hope<br/>\npeople don&#39;t think my kid is a pain&#39; stuff getting in the way! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, you&#39;ve witnessed them being less than polite, I&#39;d be<br/>\ntalking to someone about it.  If someone at the library doesn&#39;t like dealing<br/>\nwith children, then they should find another job!  Seriously, though,<br/>\nperhaps have a conversation with the person/people you feel are giving you a<br/>\nbad rap.  Ask them how you can better accommodate their needs, and then also<br/>\nexplain to them that you do your best to keep your kids quiet, but they are<br/>\nKIDS, and kids will be kids.  It&#39;s not like your letting them run like<br/>\nbanshees through the library, right! lol!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I just want to say don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.

How old is \r<br/>\nyour daughter?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI have been in this situation LOTS of times. My son (now 6) is always \r<br/>\nanimated and interrupting and I used to cringe when attending these \r<br/>\nthings. He always did the very thing (and still does to a lesser \r<br/>\ndegree) that your daughter did. And she may always (though less than \r<br/>\nnow) do those things because of her personality..she is just so \r<br/>\nexcited to share that it may come across as &quot;rude&quot; or whatever. Even \r<br/>\nif you had been sitting next to her the &quot;disruption&quot; would have still \r<br/>\noccured..only this time it would have been YOU telling her to raise \r<br/>\nher hand, be quiet, wait your turn etc.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI learned to put my son in the LAST row so I could always get to him \r<br/>\neasily. beforehand I would explain the rules of waiting to share \r<br/>\nuntil the end unless the teacher asked something then raise his hand. \r<br/>\nI also explained to him that I would put my hand on him (shoulder \r<br/>\nleg) to help him remember. I still have to walk over and place my \r<br/>\nhand on him.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI will say that I am disappointed in the library staff if they are \r<br/>\nnot working with you by being kind when you go in, thank goodness we \r<br/>\nhave a great library staff!\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI am sure that if I were on stage I would get tomatoes thrown at me \r<br/>\nfor the next part!:\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nIt is my job to raise my son. this is who my son is. Yes, I want him \r<br/>\nto fit into society by knowing the rules (raising hand etc) but in \r<br/>\nhonesty, I don&#39;t expect him to. I am not sure he will ever &quot;conform&quot; \r<br/>\nnor do I want him to. But I am not going to deny him some of these \r<br/>\nprograms because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other \r<br/>\npeople (kids teachers etc) expect of him. If he becomes too much of \r<br/>\nan annoyance they will let me know and have him removed..until next \r<br/>\ntime. And there will be a next time. and next time I will still \r<br/>\nexplain the rules and hope he remembers a little better. And if the \r<br/>\nlibrarians and other kids groan when we come in..oh well. My son is \r<br/>\nhappy and not observing their behavior and learning something. There \r<br/>\nwill always be one kid in a group that is somewhat disruptive and \r<br/>\nmine is that kid. I am no longer embarrassed by this. I got over the \r<br/>\nfact that most parents were criticizing ME because it was obviously \r<br/>\nMY fault my kid did this because I wasn&#39;t teaching him the ground \r<br/>\nrules etc. that I shouldn&#39;t allow my son to &quot;ruin&quot; other kids time \r<br/>\netc. And another homeschooler brought something to my awareness. That \r<br/>\nin these situations there may always be the chance of someone&#39;s time \r<br/>\nbeing &quot;ruined&quot; and it was ok to let that be some other kids time! It \r<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to be my sons time everytime-which it would if I never \r<br/>\nlet him sit thru these things or play at the park etc. That I would \r<br/>\nbe spending a lot of my time denying things that MIGHT turn out to be \r<br/>\nan inconvenience to others. that these &quot;others&quot; would get over it but \r<br/>\nif I continued to deny these things to my son he might NOT get over \r<br/>\nit. I might just turn out to appear to him a parent that never let \r<br/>\nhim do anything-one he would eventually resent. All because I was \r<br/>\nembarrassed what other people thought-and for me that is what it all \r<br/>\nboiled down to.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI know I ramble-sorry! In short I would say ask yourself WHY it \r<br/>\nbothers you and then do something about it. If it is embarrassing to \r<br/>\nyou (and I am not saying it is) then let it go and say &quot;this is my \r<br/>\nkid&quot; (it takes a long time to get over the embarrassment part-at \r<br/>\nleast for me). If what is bothering you is the behavior of the staff \r<br/>\nthen  I would explain that you are working on her group manners and \r<br/>\nask if they do a homeschooling group there. As for the oppression \r<br/>\nfeeling..there are others like you and I that get those looks etc. \r<br/>\nComfort yourself in knowing that the greatest inventers, poets, \r<br/>\nwriters never sat around quietly conforming. I am sure the George \r<br/>\nLucas types were constantly in the &quot;thick of things&quot; and look where \r<br/>\nit got them.

Even <br/>\nif you had been sitting next to her the &quot;disruption&quot; would have still <br/>\noccured..only this time it would have been YOU telling her to raise <br/>\nher hand, be quiet, wait your turn etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nI learned to put my son in the LAST row so I could always get to him <br/>\neasily. beforehand I would explain the rules of waiting to share <br/>\nuntil the end unless the teacher asked something then raise his hand. <br/>\nI also explained to him that I would put my hand on him (shoulder <br/>\nleg) to help him remember. I still have to walk over and place my <br/>\nhand on him.<br/>\n <br/>\nI will say that I am disappointed in the library staff if they are <br/>\nnot working with you by being kind when you go in, thank goodness we <br/>\nhave a great library staff!<br/>\n <br/>\nI am sure that if I were on stage I would get tomatoes thrown at me <br/>\nfor the next part!:<br/>\n <br/>\nIt is my job to raise my son. this is who my son is. Yes, I want him <br/>\nto fit into society by knowing the rules (raising hand etc) but in <br/>\nhonesty, I don&#39;t expect him to. I am not sure he will ever &quot;conform&quot; <br/>\nnor do I want him to. But I am not going to deny him some of these <br/>\nprograms because at this point in his life he can&#39;t do what other <br/>\npeople (kids teachers etc) expect of him. If he becomes too much of <br/>\nan annoyance they will let me know and have him removed..until next <br/>\ntime. And there will be a next time. and next time I will still <br/>\nexplain the rules and hope he remembers a little better. And if the <br/>\nlibrarians and other kids groan when we come in..oh well. My son is <br/>\nhappy and not observing their behavior and learning something. There <br/>\nwill always be one kid in a group that is somewhat disruptive and <br/>\nmine is that kid. I am no longer embarrassed by this. I got over the <br/>\nfact that most parents were criticizing ME because it was obviously <br/>\nMY fault my kid did this because I wasn&#39;t teaching him the ground <br/>\nrules etc. that I shouldn&#39;t allow my son to &quot;ruin&quot; other kids time <br/>\netc. And another homeschooler brought something to my awareness. That <br/>\nin these situations there may always be the chance of someone&#39;s time <br/>\nbeing &quot;ruined&quot; and it was ok to let that be some other kids time! It <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to be my sons time everytime-which it would if I never <br/>\nlet him sit thru these things or play at the park etc. That I would <br/>\nbe spending a lot of my time denying things that MIGHT turn out to be <br/>\nan inconvenience to others. that these &quot;others&quot; would get over it but <br/>\nif I continued to deny these things to my son he might NOT get over <br/>\nit. I might just turn out to appear to him a parent that never let <br/>\nhim do anything-one he would eventually resent. All because I was <br/>\nembarrassed what other people thought-and for me that is what it all <br/>\nboiled down to.<br/>\n <br/>\nI know I ramble-sorry! In short I would say ask yourself WHY it <br/>\nbothers you and then do something about it. If it is embarrassing to <br/>\nyou (and I am not saying it is) then let it go and say &quot;this is my <br/>\nkid&quot; (it takes a long time to get over the embarrassment part-at <br/>\nleast for me). If what is bothering you is the behavior of the staff <br/>\nthen  I would explain that you are working on her group manners and <br/>\nask if they do a homeschooling group there. As for the oppression <br/>\nfeeling..there are others like you and I that get those looks etc. <br/>\nComfort yourself in knowing that the greatest inventers, poets, <br/>\nwriters never sat around quietly conforming. I am sure the George <br/>\nLucas types were constantly in the &quot;thick of things&quot; and look where <br/>\nit got them. Remind your librarian that there are libraries because <br/>\nthere are writers of fantasy etc and those writers stepped over the <br/>\nline of what people considered &quot;acceptable&quot; thoughts etc!<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, now that I am covered in rotten food I will step down and <br/>\ndismiss myself</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: library & school programs & unschooling","postDate":"1233708814","msgId":38178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFFRENFQkQ0LUY3NTEtNDY3Ny04NzAwLUEwOUJERjA2NEU4RkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3OTkyNC43OTI5OC5xbUB3ZWIzNjQwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY3OTkyNC43OTI5OC5xbUB3ZWIzNjQwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38177,"nextInTopic":38179,"prevInTime":38177,"nextInTime":38179,"topicId":38172,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How old are your girls? ...
