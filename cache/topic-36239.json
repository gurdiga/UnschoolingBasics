They have<br/>\n&gt; never been sound sleepers.We have always slept with our children.My 5<br/>\n&gt; year old has started to sleep in but the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>\n&gt; same time everyday even if he goes to bed late. I don&#39;t know if I am<br/>\n&gt; doing this right. I know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>\n&gt; support. The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well<br/>\n&gt; with the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it<br/>\n&gt; big time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Amanda<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Karen Swanay&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;luvbullbreeds@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; We pulled the boys from school about 2 yrs ago.

I already<br/>\n&gt; wrote this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; in the sleep survey someone posted but when I let go of trying to<br/>\n&gt; control<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sleep the boys went wild with it.  Staying up all night, sleeping<br/>\n&gt; all day.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  But here we are about a year into this and now they go to bed at<br/>\n10 pm<br/>\n&gt; &gt; every night (their idea) and they are up about 7-8am each day.

But just in the last two weeks, my<br/>\n&gt; oldest who<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hates to read asked me to buy him a book and he&#39;s been reading for<br/>\n&gt; pleasure.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Just let go and trust your kids.

Support their interests - that is your  <br/>\nunschooling mantra. Their interests are being physical and wild, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo things together out of the house really often in places that  <br/>\nencourage really active hard play. They need the burn-off time. Maybe  <br/>\nstop now and make a list of ALL the places you can think of that are  <br/>\nwithin, say, an hour of home. Every different park, beach, playground,  <br/>\nice-skating and roller-skating rinks, bowling, play places at fast  <br/>\nfood restaurants. Water play is the BEST - a pool is ideal, playing in  <br/>\nsprinklers, with a hose, with lots of containers, a slip-n-slide, or  <br/>\neven in the bathtub, is great. Put down a bunch of towels all over the  <br/>\nfloor and let them splash and have fun. Let them do that alone, not  <br/>\nalways with their brother, too, because water play is very centering  <br/>\nand brings a deep sense of peace. With little boys that age, I&#39;d be  <br/>\ngoing out every single day. Also, be sure you have plenty of play  <br/>\nequipment at home - a trampoline in the back yard, a swing set and  <br/>\nother climbing equipment?<br/>\n<br/>\nInitiate fun activity that use a lot of energy. I used to set up  <br/>\n&quot;obstacle courses&quot; in the house when the weather was bad. After I&#39;d  <br/>\nset one up, we&#39;d time them on it, over and over. Then they&#39;d get  <br/>\nstarted making their own obstacle courses and would spend a long time  <br/>\ndoing them. When I was out at thrift stores or Big Lots or 99 cent  <br/>\nstores, I&#39;d find things that could be used as part of an obstacle  <br/>\ncourse. Be really creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF they&#39;re interested, they might like a martial arts activity that is  <br/>\ngeared toward young children. Martial arts programs can sometimes be  <br/>\nreally really fun for little kids with a lot of focus on games. Shop  <br/>\naround and choose carefully, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nSibling rivalry will be lessened the more you find many ways to  <br/>\nsupport their interests and provide an abundance of what they need. It  <br/>\nwon&#39;t disappear entirely, probably, because these are kids who are  <br/>\njust learning to be social and they&#39;re living in very close proximity  <br/>\nto others who are also just learning. Conflict is pretty much  <br/>\ninevitable, to some degree. Expect it and don&#39;t get all emotional over  <br/>\nit, yourself. Try distracting them toward something cool/positive/ <br/>\ndesired as often as possible - in a way that meets the child&#39;s needs  <br/>\nto the maximum extent you can manage. Sometimes &quot;give it to them in  <br/>\nfantasy&quot; is an amazing tension-reducer in sibling rivalry situations.  <br/>\nFor example, if the kids are fighting over which tv show to watch or  <br/>\nover using the video game console or over who gets to sit where in the  <br/>\ncar or .... give it to them in fantasy in a big way. Say, &quot;Gosh, you  <br/>\nknow what I really wish? I wish someone would invent a tv that showed  <br/>\neach person just what THAT person wanted to see - all at the same  <br/>\ntime.&quot; IF you become skilled at staying cool, calm and collected in  <br/>\nthe face of conflict, you can sense whether or not these kinds of  <br/>\nthings will help or add fuel to the fire. Depends. Also, be sure to  <br/>\ngive them plenty of time apart from each other. Maybe they need a lot  <br/>\nmore of that than is convenient for you, but making the effort to find  <br/>\nways to do it will pay off.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing will just &quot;fix&quot; the sibling rivalry or the exhaustion that  <br/>\ncomes of having 3 and 5 yo little boys around all the time. Change  <br/>\nyour expectations and remember it is all a process. Try to experience  <br/>\nthe feeling of life flowing like a river, rather than expecting it to  <br/>\nbe static like a lake.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; ~~Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children?

Especially since it seems like there&#39;s been some <br/>\nstress with dad being gone and mom being tired. Expect a certain <br/>\namount of &quot;transitionalness&quot; as all y&#39;all get used to being home <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My 5 year old wants to watch lots of TV <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A good time for extra snuggling. Do you have lots of toys in the <br/>\nsame room as the tv? After awhile you&#39;ll likely find they play as <br/>\nmuch as they watch - if not more. My 7yo likes to have tv on in the <br/>\nbackground while she plays, but I swear I don&#39;t know how she has <br/>\ntime to watch with all the projects she has going on!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;they both don&#39;t want to go to bed<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you mean you&#39;re trying to get them to bed at a certain time? That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work for a Lot of kids. It takes time for young people to <br/>\nfigure out the whole &quot;energy management&quot; thing. What does &quot;tired&quot; <br/>\nmean, beyond some kind of weird parental agenda? It takes some time <br/>\nand experimentation to get a handle on it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething to keep in mind if the kids seem &quot;over tired&quot; is to make <br/>\nsure they are getting plenty of protein. Some of that grogginess is <br/>\na need for food/drinks. Its good to have snacks readily available <br/>\nall the time *and* to offer them periodically, especially with <br/>\nactive kids, who don&#39;t always notice they are hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>\n&gt; same time everyday even if he goes to bed late<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some people are like that - but its also a good idea to look for <br/>\nenvironmental factors, like the sun coming up! If there&#39;s something <br/>\n*waking* him, you may be able to change that. If not, well I&#39;ve been <br/>\nthere with a cranky &quot;hung over&quot; 3yo, its no fun, for sure, but you <br/>\ncan take steps to make it better. The most important is to make a <br/>\nmental note: Kid is Tired, and plan your day accordingly. Pare down <br/>\nany errands or outings to what&#39;s purely necessary. Plan to do more <br/>\nsnuggling or bathing or tv watching or any other &quot;calming&quot; <br/>\nactivities. Offer protein regularly. The idea is to ease the stress <br/>\nfor everyone and be his ally in terms of figuring out this <br/>\nwhole &quot;sleep&quot; thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My boys<br/>\n&gt; are just turning 3 and 5...they are boys with loads of physical<br/>\n&gt; energy, demands and sibling rivalry. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The more time and energy you can spend helping them get their <br/>\nvarious needs met, the better. Find ways to work *with* all that <br/>\nenergy- make sure there are plenty of things for them to climb, hit, <br/>\nthrow, tackle, jump on (and off and over), swing, swing on... you <br/>\nget the idea! Take note of when they seem to need snacks and try to <br/>\noffer those *before* they get to the so-hungry-I&#39;m-gonna-hit-someone <br/>\nstage. Also notice any kind of natural ups and downs - for instance, <br/>\nmaybe one of them needs a break around the time the other usually <br/>\ngears up? So you&#39;d look for a way to make both those things <br/>\npossible - like going for a walk with one in a stroller, or setting <br/>\nup one with a bath while you play &quot;balloon soccer&quot; with the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlan to drop any projects or expectations you have for yourself for <br/>\nawhile so you can devote extra time and energy to your kids. Pare <br/>\ndown the housework to a bare minimum (even if you have to lower your <br/>\nstandards) or find ways to streamline the cleanup. That&#39;s something <br/>\nI still do periodically, when I notice my kids are more grumpy and <br/>\nout of sorts than usual, and it almost always helps to get us all <br/>\nreconnected and restore everyone&#39;s equilibrium. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am having a couple of bad days<br/>\n&gt; now...feeling like a crappy mother for being so tired and cranky <br/>\n </span></blockquote>from<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; lack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling <br/>\n </span></blockquote>disconnected<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; from everyone I know. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, geez and here I go telling you to Spend more time and energy! <br/>\nBut just like you can look for ways for one kid to get a little down <br/>\ntime while the other plays, you can look for the same sort of thing <br/>\nwith yourSelf in mind. Indoor play-places can be a boon for that - <br/>\nyou can sit on a bench and zone out while the kids whoop it up. <br/>\nBubbles can work well, too - you sit and blow them, the kids run <br/>\naround trying to catch them. A length of soft fabric is nice, too - <br/>\nsomething really &quot;silky&quot;. You hold two corners and wave it gently <br/>\nwhile the kids run in and out underneath. I don&#39;t know where you <br/>\nlive, but in my neck of the woods we have lots of small streams and <br/>\ncreeks that are fantastic for young kids&#39; play. Lots of mud and <br/>\nfrogs and rocks and mud and crawdads and slime and mud. Bring a <br/>\nchange of clothes if you do that ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t forget the tv! Don&#39;t use tv-time as a way to get housework <br/>\ndone, sit with the kids. Use it as a chance to connect with them. <br/>\nEven if they&#39;re all wrapped up in the show, they will be happy to <br/>\nhave you with them and feel closer to you. That&#39;s worth a Lot. Just <br/>\nhanging out around the tv with my kids goes a long way to smoothing <br/>\nthings over when they are getting on each other&#39;s nerves. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"&quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Not a surprise to any RU veteran but might be a boost to other newbies","postDate":"1222568245","msgId":36248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwOTI3MTkxN282MjAyMGUzMnkxMzczYzY4ZTdhM2FjNDVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdibWYwYStiY3VyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwOTI3MDY1MXQzZGQxNDNiZm1mMWNlNWU1NjJmMzI2NWU4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGdibWYwYStiY3VyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36247,"nextInTopic":36249,"prevInTime":36247,"nextInTime":36249,"topicId":36239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children?

I realize looking back at it she really dug in deep because we (me<br/>\nand her papa) had issues. I finally let them go and then convinced her papa<br/>\nto lay off. We relaxed and she shifted gears. She started walking away from<br/>\nTV herself. She started doing other things while watching TV.

Are they tired?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to watch them gel in front of the screen for so long.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen don&#39;t watch them either watch with them or do something you enjoy. When<br/>\nmy dd was super into TV I just gave my son all of me. It was almost like he<br/>\nwas an only for a couple months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want Ru to be our<br/>\nlife more than you could all know.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet your life be your life. Let it all go. All the expectations, just enjoy<br/>\nwhere you and your kids are.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am having a couple of bad days<br/>\nnow...feeling like a crappy mother for being so tired and cranky from<br/>\nlack of sleep...questioning myself constantly...feeling disconnected<br/>\nfrom everyone I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I feel this way I try to stay away from other people. just chill at<br/>\nhome as much as possible. I try to either get more sleep or do low key<br/>\nactivities like watch TV or movies. I can sometimes read (hard with a<br/>\ntoddler but somewhat easier with a 3+)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gone to our local unschooling group a few<br/>\ntimes...most of the core parents don&#39;t have more than one child...plus<br/>\nthe kids are older and into their own thing so they are not very<br/>\ninterested in us for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind another group or start one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDad was out of town for 4 days and they need me to cuddle them all<br/>\nnight...they are missing him, waking up every 1-2 hours. They have<br/>\nnever been sound sleepers.We have always slept with our children.My 5<br/>\nyear old has started to sleep in but the 3 year old wakes up at the<br/>\nsame time everyday even if he goes to bed late.<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps you can help him fall asleep by setting the stage for sleeping. it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to be a power struggle, just be there and guide them through<br/>\nsleepiness. I don&#39;t know how to advice you as mine have always slept/woke on<br/>\ntheir own for the most part. I just watch for cues and then help them where<br/>\nthey need it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I am<br/>\ndoing this right.<br/>\n<br/>\nFiguring out how to adjust to new stuff is hard for you and your kids. You<br/>\nwill all need time to adjust. Go slow, say yes more. Be in the moment, be<br/>\nright there with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it is hard at first just needing some moral<br/>\nsupport. The siblings without rivalry book does not work very well<br/>\nwith the younger ones...I am wondering any wisdom for me? I need it<br/>\nbig time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardest thing for me to learn was to be happy exactly where we are. Some<br/>\ndays are more challenging and are really crazy. That&#39;s life. It is your<br/>\nperspective that creates the judgment. I had to learn that just because my<br/>\nkids fight or my kid does something &quot;weird&quot; in public it doesn&#39;t mean I am a<br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; mama. If my ds eats nothing but candy one day, it is not a reflection<br/>\non me. I can be mindful and loving when my kid is throwing a fit. It takes<br/>\npractice but it starts to get easier as you do it more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest key to helping sibs get along is not to take sides. be there to<br/>\nhelp them work it out but don&#39;t tell them the right way, listen to them<br/>\nopenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw My big hurdle was eating. I am a health &quot;nut&quot;. It was really difficult<br/>\n(ok it still is) for me to give up control in this area. My ds5 loves candy<br/>\nand sweets. he has pretty much had free access (within our budget) for about<br/>\n2 years now. And I still get tense every once in a while when he goes on a<br/>\nbinge. I know how to not only hold my tongue but relax through it. At 5 he<br/>\nis learning to listen to his body, I am so thrilled for him. I never had<br/>\nthat option as a kid. And just today he fell asleep in the car. dd11 and I<br/>\nran into the farm store to get apples for babydd&#39;s party. We got apples,<br/>\napple cider and cheese. She remembered that they have old fashion candy<br/>\nsticks so she wanted to get on for her and her sibs. I thought that was<br/>\nthoughtful. When dd11 or ds5 was a baby I would have freaked f someone gave<br/>\nthem candy...now I am letting my one year have a candy stick. That is<br/>\nprogress for me. When ds woke up his sister havded him the candy. He smiled<br/>\nand thanked her. Then he saw she was eating a pear and wanted that instead.<br/>\nSo he eat a pear (to the seeds) and then had the candy stick. He wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave been able to choose to eat a pear over candy a couple years ago either.<br/>\nHe had to feel free to eat which ever he choose before he could really eat<br/>\nfreely.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Not a surprise to any RU veteran but might be a boost to other newbies","postDate":"1222565962","msgId":36247,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc5MzI5NC44NzAwOS5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwNS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdibWYwYStiY3VyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36244,"nextInTopic":36248,"prevInTime":36246,"nextInTime":36248,"topicId":36239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Does anyone have any experience with RU and younger children?

I need it big time.~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI have experienced that too, that the techniques in the book aren&#39;t geared so much towards 3 year olds.  I too would LOVE to hear about some things that work with the younger crowd.  Our girls bicker, hit, kick, quite a bit, and I&#39;m sure most times I could be responding much more effectively.  Often I find myself stumped at knowing if there is an unmet need, and if so, what the need is.  Any wisdom in this area???<br/>\n <br/>\nJodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":341424269,"authorName":"aenclade","from":"&quot;aenclade&quot; &lt;aenclade@...&gt;","profile":"aenclade","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not a surprise to any RU veteran but might be a boost to other newbies","postDate":"1222557514","msgId":36244,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdibWYwYStiY3VyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwOTI3MDY1MXQzZGQxNDNiZm1mMWNlNWU1NjJmMzI2NWU4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36239,"nextInTopic":36247,"prevInTime":36243,"nextInTime":36245,"topicId":36239,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, your post gives me some hope.
