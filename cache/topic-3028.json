But I think it was my daughter sticking stuffed animals<br/>\nunder her clothes and pulling the six yr old cousin off to the bathroom<br/>\nyelling &quot;Come on, let&#39;s do waterbirths!&quot; and then giving him a complete<br/>\ndetailed description of how that happened exactly that pushed her over the<br/>\nedge.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very happy they do not live nearby as I am envisioning how difficult<br/>\nthat would all be.  Any chance you could just find some chosen family to<br/>\nreplace them?<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n&quot;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than<br/>\nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it.&quot;  ...
