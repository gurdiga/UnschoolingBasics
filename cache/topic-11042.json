And certainly learning isn&#39;t something which can be successfully measured on the basis of days or weeks - that&#39;s one of the reasons schools fail, by trying to measure short term learning when real learning is a complex, swirly sort of process of making connections. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood stuff about how learning works, here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/connections/\">http://sandradodd.com/connections/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m excited to see what other people are doing and how their days go!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This morning - it&#39;s just past noon as I type this - my 10yo has worked on one of her comic books, played a video game, played a game on her DSi, and drew some mythical creatures. It&#39;s raining, or she would have jumped on the trampoline, too ;) That&#39;s what a lot of her days look like, with books, movies, legos, computer animation and pc games thrown into the mix, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 18yo is technically no longer unschooling, but the only real difference between before and after the magic b-day, here, was the sudden ability to get a tattoo. So today he has showered off more new-tattoo funk, done a little laundry, and gone back out to his cabin, which he&#39;s working on enlarging. Later on he&#39;ll probably go help a neighbor with a small farm - gotta make more money to have more colors added to the tat ;) or work on his metal or wood working projects. Winter is a mellow, home-bound time for him. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":234689290,"authorName":"momof4","from":"&quot;momof4&quot; &lt;aasmasking@...&gt;","profile":"aasmasking","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New to the group","postDate":"1327594826","msgId":47859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmcnVnYSsxYXRuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41899,"nextInTopic":47861,"prevInTime":47858,"nextInTime":47860,"topicId":11042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi my name is Amy I m married with 4 children (12, 11, 9 and 8).

My middle schoolers hated it and my husband (who oversees everything when I&#39;m in class) did not have the patience for them along with our very hyperactive 8 yo! So it was either put our youngest on medication (which at this point we are not ready for) or let the older two go back and reconsider when I graduate at the end of the year. We decided that after the holidays the older two would go back to ps and that we were going to step away from the curriculum and try unschooling. So far we LOVE it, and the progress my youngest has made not being tied to a curriculum amazes us everyday!  My 9yo also loves it she enjoys all the time she gets to spend out exploring with her dad and brother, and the extra time it gives her to focus on her favorite thing to do, dance!

I&#39;m looking for more fun games to play with my 3 and almost 2 year old. We just started playing Cranium&#39;s Hullabaloo and that is a load of fun. Nathan my 3 1/2 year old can recognize all of the peices and understand, recognize the colors and shapes and so he can fully play, Marissa (almost 2) has fun just dancing around and jumping on a spot. The directions are easy, you don&#39;t have to read anything you just flip on the game and it tells you what to do, for example jump to a blue peice or wiggle to a triangle or spin to an animal, then it will say whoever is standing on the tiger peice is the winner. My son loved it even though he didn&#39;t win for 14 rounds, if the winning peice was open he just went over to stand on it and took a bow. It is a fun, very active game and it helps them build on color, memory, recognition, shapes, etc. We also have fun with memory games. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello Michele,<br/>\n&gt; I am new to the group too.

They totally lost interest in the materials, so I started researching again about other homeschooling styles. I read long ago about unschooling and I feel this is the right path for us. Both my girls were born at home I&#39;m SOOO glad for that decision! It seems that many years from now I will be feeling the same way about unschooling.<br/>\nI welcome any comments and words of wisdom.<br/>\nAlso, I was wondering if there are any fun board games for this age. <br/>\nThanks a lot!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":392492431,"authorName":"katinaslp","from":"&quot;katinaslp&quot; &lt;kat-slp@...&gt;","profile":"katinaslp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New to the group","postDate":"1240880881","msgId":39835,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd0NWt0aCtmajl2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEE5NTY3RTMwQUE4ODQ2MTY4Nzk3NUQ0RkNEQjhGRDRGQFJvY2tldFNhdWNlMj4="},"prevInTopic":39822,"nextInTopic":41890,"prevInTime":39834,"nextInTime":39836,"topicId":11042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Melissa, we are in Indiana.

In fact, <br/>\nI told him to write his own curriculum, i.e. if you could learn <br/>\nanything you want, what would it be? His answers were amazing and we <br/>\nare having so much fun pursuing this course. <br/>\nI am such a product of institutional school - all through college in <br/>\nprivate Catholic schools! But this way of doing things feels so much <br/>\nmore organic to me - I&#39;m really more of a natural, organic person and <br/>\nthis is much more fitting to our lifestyle, and more fitting to his <br/>\nlearning style (my daughter is a totally different story). <br/>\nAnyway, now I&#39;m thinking this might have a name...unschooling. Is this <br/>\nwhat we&#39;re doing? Is there a &#39;right&#39; way and a &#39;wrong&#39; way to unschool?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99641725,"authorName":"Lorraine","from":"&quot;Lorraine&quot; &lt;missrainydaze@...&gt;","profile":"missrainydaze","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New to the group","postDate":"1149346953","msgId":14021,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1czhhOSs1MHZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11042,"nextInTopic":22156,"prevInTime":14020,"nextInTime":14022,"topicId":11042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I just joined the group and wanted to introduce myself.

My name is <br/>\nLorraine and I am happily married to Eric and we have 5 beautiful <br/>\nchildren (Athena Grace-11 yrs, Jesse Josiah-11yrs, Malachi Jaedon-3 <br/>\nyrs, Isaiah Elias-2 yrs, Xanna Joy-9 months). I have been <br/>\nhomeschooling for 4 years now and it has been a constant struggle <br/>\nwith my twins. I recently came across the concept of unschooling and <br/>\nI think it is the right choice for us. I did not expect my hubby to <br/>\nagree with it, but when I explained it to him he was in full <br/>\nagreement. I was shocked! So, we are beginners and are looking <br/>\nforward to some great ideas from all of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband owns an ACE Hardware store and our 11 yr old son will <br/>\noften work at the store. He punches in and earns a paycheck like <br/>\neveryone else. It&#39;s amazing all that he learns just by doing this, <br/>\nboth educational and social. He&#39;s a favorite among the regular <br/>\ncustomers. He&#39;s also an avid gardener and spends most of his days in <br/>\nour yard working on his latest project. He also plays on a soccer <br/>\nteam in the fall; made all-stars last year.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis twin sister is not so motivated and would prefer laying on the <br/>\ncouch in front of the television all day. She does like art and <br/>\ncrafts. She&#39;s very social and loves being with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to sharing stories with all of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nLorraine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220015843,"authorName":"Kristie Cochran","from":"Kristie Cochran &lt;kristiecochran@...&gt;","profile":"kristiecochran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New to the group","postDate":"1143240606","msgId":11042,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0MjQ3NzlFLjgwMjA2MDdAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14021,"prevInTime":11041,"nextInTime":11043,"topicId":11042,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I just joined this group yesterday and am quite fascinated with unschooling.

I have two boys, the oldest is 4.5 and the youngest is <br/>\n16mo.  My older son is currently in preschool 2 days a week, mainly to <br/>\ngive me a break.  My older son really forced AP on us.  We didn&#39;t really <br/>\nknow what it was before he was born.  He was a very high needs baby who <br/>\n*required* co-sleeping and slinging and extended bfing.  We found that <br/>\nwe really loved co-sleeping and we are all sleeping in the same room now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is also pretty smart.  He&#39;s had his own computer since he was <br/>\n18mo and learned his alphabet and numbers by playing computer games. <br/>\nHe&#39;s extremely proficient on the computer and now our 16mo is starting <br/>\nto get the hang of using the computer too.  I&#39;ve had some apprehension <br/>\nletting him have so much screen time, but after poking around on Sandra <br/>\nDodd&#39;s website, I&#39;m feeling much better about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS#1 is also very spirited, so he&#39;s had a little bit of trouble in <br/>\npreschool, which is why I&#39;m looking to homeschool him.  He&#39;s not one to <br/>\nsit and do work at the tables.  He moves and talks from the time he <br/>\nwakes until the time he goes to bed. He was &quot;kicked out&quot; of his 4yo <br/>\nclass and moved back to the 3yo class because of this.  It&#39;s then that I <br/>\ndecided he probably needed a little more one-on-one time and freedom to <br/>\nlearn what he wanted to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur DS#2, I&#39;ve nicknamed &quot;appliance boy.&quot;  He loves appliances!  He <br/>\ndrags around my hairdryer and the hand mixer (sans beaters).  He just <br/>\nloves anything that makes noise and has a cord.  He also loves music. <br/>\nMy DH is a musician and he has them up on his lap playing the piano all <br/>\nthe time (which he tells me is quite mathematical).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m currently reading Learning All The Time and am fascinated by it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the only Holt book that my branch library had.  I definitely need <br/>\nto have this book as part of my personal library.  I look forward to <br/>\nlearning more about unschooling and applying it to our daily life (which <br/>\nwe seem to already be doing).<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47853,"nextTopicId":47863}}
