I&#39;m interpreting the &quot;we&quot; in<br/>\n&quot;nor do we go that deep&quot; as meaning your dh and yourself at home. Are you<br/>\nhappy and contented in your interests? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your kids are pursuing a range of cool interests, some of<br/>\nwhich take them out of the house (or maybe online). They must remember that<br/>\nthese other places of cultural enrichment exist because you used to go to<br/>\nthem. If their interests are the library and fashion design, respectively,<br/>\nthey are ideally placed to hear about current events that they may wish to<br/>\nattend. I&#39;m finding it hard to visualize them as problematically isolated. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould they be likely to say to you, &quot;Gee I wish we still went to ... more<br/>\noften&quot;, or would they respond to you sometimes saying, &quot;Do you want to go to<br/>\nthat museum we used to like any time?&quot; Of course a traveling exhibition of<br/>\nclothing history or library architecture/history might have them champing at<br/>\nthe bit to go. I would think that talking to them about their stuff would be<br/>\nthe best way to discover the next connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about Unschooling is that the results look different<br/>\nin every family. It allows different family cultures (nice phrase), as long<br/>\nas they are meeting the needs of the members, to flourish, rather than be<br/>\nundermined by the &quot;shoulds&quot; of school or mainstream culture. However that<br/>\nvery family uniqueness sometimes means parents worry that something might be<br/>\ninadequate or underrepresented. I would suggest looking closely at your<br/>\nkids. Are they happy and contented and engaged and curious?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in our family dh and I have a tendency towards being sedentary, and I<br/>\nhave to push myself to be more social. We were talking it over and realized<br/>\nthat the physical activity area is one that our modeling is lacking for Jayn<br/>\n- at least in the winter; in summer we swim in the pool every day. I<br/>\nrealized that Jayn finds all sorts of ways to be very physically active<br/>\nevery day, indoors and out, including suddenly saying &quot;Let&#39;s do some yoga&quot;.<br/>\nShe is modeling healthy activities for us instead! <br/>\n<br/>\nToday Jayn asked that Daddy be the one to take her to her regular dance<br/>\nclass and park event afterwards. I am using the time to do some emailing and<br/>\nother stuff, but it sure is odd to be suddenly &quot;free&quot; for what will be<br/>\nseveral hours, rather than just one or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I&#39;m trying to let go of college worries and worries about the <br/>\nnew asst. superintendent&#39;s expectations in order to do what we really <br/>\nwant. My 14-yr-old daughter believes she wants to be a children&#39;s <br/>\nlibrarian, which requires college and an MA in library science. She&#39;s <br/>\naddicted to books and organizing book shelves, etc...it&#39;s lovely to <br/>\nsee. She also hasn&#39;t imagined herself doing anything else for a long <br/>\ntime. I&#39;d like to make sure this will be possible for her, but I&#39;d also <br/>\nlike not to have to answer to anyone else&#39;s requirements. If I can get <br/>\npast my town&#39;s issues (which are somewhat unknown because he&#39;s new and <br/>\nI&#39;m loosening up simultaneously),  the community college path sounds <br/>\nlike a natural for her eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a different question I want to raise... Several times I&#39;ve seen <br/>\npeople talking about if you supply a rich environment, your kids will <br/>\nnaturally learn all sorts of stuff from what you&#39;re doing, etc. I found <br/>\nthat true when our kids were younger -- rich was easy, because <br/>\neverything was new to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, what if your environment is rich, say, in people analysis and <br/>\nliterature, but you&#39;re basically a stay-at-home, bookish, craftish kind <br/>\nof family? What if you&#39;re not always out going to this and that museum, <br/>\ncultural events, exploring all over the place? We did more of that when <br/>\nthe kids were younger, but my personal interests have gotten more <br/>\naesthetic and my husband&#39;s have only gotten more literary, and the kids <br/>\naren&#39;t interested in sharing in what we&#39;re involved with that much. <br/>\nThey have their own stuff going -- reading, Model United Nations, <br/>\nlibrary volunteer work for the eldest; writing, SIMS, fashion design <br/>\nfor the youngest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are great interests and they do pursue them. But I still feel <br/>\nkind of deficient on the &quot;rich environment&quot; part of things... we&#39;re <br/>\njust not very broad-based, nor do we go that deep into anything either! <br/>\nAt the same time I worry about it, this is still very much our family <br/>\nculture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very interested in others&#39; perspectives on this and will try not to <br/>\nbe oversensitive!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4822,"nextTopicId":4834}}
