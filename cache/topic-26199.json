And kids know that and they love us and if we apologize and  try <br/>\nto do better next time they forgive us, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to mess up. I&#39;m sure the cracker incident felt like it could wait  <br/>\na couple of minutes. And you&#39;re going to mess up on something else, again. And <br/>\n it&#39;s going to be okay. And your kids are learning that their parents can <br/>\nmess up  and take responsibility for it, and if they mess up, it&#39;ll also be okay.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for long time unschoolers to get the &quot;well, of course it works  for <br/>\nyou -- you/your child is exceptional.&quot; One of the things I hear a lot is  <br/>\n&quot;we&#39;d just fight all the time.&quot; I explain that they might fight at first, but  <br/>\nwhen you don&#39;t have to rush out to the next thing you can deal with the conflict <br/>\n and move on. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for sharing this story, and thanks for being a good dad.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195592821,"authorName":"Robert Saxon","from":"&quot;Robert Saxon&quot; &lt;TheSaxons@...&gt;","profile":"rob_saxon_2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Kids did fine, I was awful","postDate":"1189829789","msgId":26199,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDcwOTE0MjExNmo1ZGE0N2ZjZGlmMTQ5MzViYzYyNThjOWMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26203,"prevInTime":26198,"nextInTime":26200,"topicId":26199,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last night was really bad for me, but my kids were wonderful.

We put her off &quot;for a few minutes.&quot;  I made a phone call to my<br/>\nown father, and while talking with him, dd#1 came in a few minutes later and<br/>\nsaid that she needed me &quot;right now!&quot;  I asked what was wrong, and she said<br/>\nthat dd2 wouldn&#39;t share the cheese crackers.  I said that I&#39;d be in in a<br/>\nminute.  I wasn&#39;t.  5-10 minutes later dd1 is upset b/c dd2 has eaten<br/>\neverything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had let myself get stressed before this, and for some reason I went<br/>\nhurtling off the deep end screaming &quot;cannonball!&quot;.  Well, I did some yelling<br/>\nat dd2, anyway.  Not proud of myself a-tall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told them about how bad I felt for ignoring them and for yelling, and<br/>\napologized to both of them as well.  (The conversation was a bit more<br/>\nsubstantive than this, but that&#39;s the gist.)  And both tried to make ME feel<br/>\nbetter when I was the one being an idiot.  Wish I&#39;d been able to de-school<br/>\nmyself and do a lot of this before I had kids so they wouldn&#39;t have to put<br/>\nup with all this baggage of mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why tell y&#39;all all this?  I suppose it&#39;s to re-iterate that when we do<br/>\nscrew up, there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;ll give us another one (another chance,<br/>\nthat is).<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I don&#39;t deserve my own kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nComments and questions are most welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rob<br/>\nDH to Seana for 10 years<br/>\n&quot;Daddy!&quot; to Genevieve for 5.75 years, Elissa for 4.5 years<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26307,"nextTopicId":26383}}
