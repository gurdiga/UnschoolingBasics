I think you&#39;re bringing up really wonderful issues to consider in light of how unschooling works: the nature of learning and relationships are right at the core of unschooling, so I&#39;m going to keep on with those topics. But if it makes you uncomfortable, feel free to skip over my posts. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, Because it is sometimes emotionally challenging to see one&#39;s words discussed in this manner, feel free to ask any of the list owners or moderators to post something for you anonymously. Sometimes that can help you see people responding to words and ideas rather than taking the matter personally. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnward!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;much, if not almost all of that learning, is by imitating what is modeled for them<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all, or even most, actually. Kids do learn from what they see, but they learn a great deal by trying out what they see and comparing their unique experiences to what they expect to happen. That&#39;s important! A lot of parents of young children, especially, get hung up on the idea of &quot;modelling&quot; - I did, and it got in the way of my understanding how people learn. Observation is part of it, but humans are&#39;t just sponges - not even very young children! Experimentation and comparison is a big, big part of how people decide Which parts of what they observe are useful to them as individuals. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hiding one&#39;s feelings - will not build a healthy relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on what you mean - and not all relationships need aspire to an ideal of health to be valuable. My relationship with my stepson&#39;s mother is much, much better for my efforts to hide my feelings. She&#39;s not in a position to respond to my feelings with anything other than defensiveness - she&#39;s too fragile, emotionally - so out of kindness to her I don&#39;t express them. My girlfriend is fragile in similar ways, so I only share feelings with her she&#39;s able to respond to without delving into her own issues. She doesn&#39;t want me to be her therapist!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that being said, not all relationships are worth keeping, including those with family members. If an adult relationship is putting too much stress on your children and your relationship with them, it may be better to step away as gently as you can, with nothing said at all. Hiding your real feelings is sometimes an act of kindness - and the world needs more kindness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hiding one&#39;s feelings - will not build a healthy relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In regards to parenting, sometimes hiding one&#39;s feelings is better for children. My kids don&#39;t always need to know about My old baggage rearing its ugly head, sometimes they&#39;re better served by me biting my  tongue and learning from them, learning to see the world afresh, through their eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying its a good idea to &quot;always&quot; hide one&#39;s feelings - sometimes those feelings are useful information, sometimes they do help to deepen a parent-child relationship. But adult feelings can get in the way, too - in the way of seeing our children for who they are, and in the way of children developing their own views and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;hiding feelings makes self esteem suffer<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My own experience is that when I conceal my feelings out of kindness to another person, my self esteem grows. I see myself as more sensitive and caring. It might be good to add as a caveat, that I don&#39;t exactly have a silver tongue in person! I&#39;m not a smooth or witty conversationalist for the most part and I&#39;m much more likely to think of a gentle and non-intrusive way of phrasing something After I&#39;ve stuck my food in my mouth. So silence, for me, really is golden at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good example of taking a good idea or principle - that feelings are valuable and worthwhile - and creating a rule around it: don&#39;t hide them. Step away from the rule and see the reasons behind it. It can be just as good to honor another&#39;s feelings as one&#39;s own by being silent, or sidestepping an issue by changing the subject. But that&#39;s not a rule either! One should not Always hide one&#39;s feelings anymore than one should Never do such a thing. It&#39;s a matter of building up understanding and communication skills. The more you understand someone else&#39;s perspective, the more thoughtfully you can decide how your words will impact that person. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":178804705,"authorName":"Daria S","from":"&quot;Daria S&quot; &lt;daria_simionescu@...&gt;","profile":"lilreddgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Other&#39;s quizzing my child","postDate":"1318178922","msgId":47480,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo2c2o5YSs3bjJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo2c2VmMytqMm50QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47477,"nextInTopic":47482,"prevInTime":47479,"nextInTime":47481,"topicId":47430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m feeling a bit defensive too :) - that s definitely my baggage I would reword my choice of words: false politeness.

But the Rebel Flag flying from neighbors homes and emblazoned on local pickup trucks and ball caps is good and noble and patriotic. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo knows we live on land stolen from other people and farmed by people  forced into slavery. She doesn&#39;t know the details of the Civil War, but she knows that our home has a sad and bloody history and some of our ancestors may have done shameful things - that&#39;s not something she would have learned in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Other&#39;s quizzing my child","postDate":"1317999083","msgId":47459,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo2bjNsYitha21wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRTUyODUwMzZCQkI1My0xOEQ4LTJEM0E2QFdlYm1haWwtbTEyNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47458,"nextInTopic":47460,"prevInTime":47458,"nextInTime":47460,"topicId":47430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** Ray just turned 18 - about a week ago.

He&#39;s been working in one capacity or another for four years. Some of it is the kind of &quot;after school&quot; and &quot;summer job&quot; stuff other boys his age do - yard work and odd jobs, but he does it whenever its needed and has built a reputation as someone who can be depended on to show up and help out. He has also worked for local farmers doing fencing and animal care, worked at a local tree farm, and he has made and sold wood and metal creations at events and shows. He was able to purchase everything he wanted for his party with money he made at a show the week before, selling wooden spoons, forks and hand-made knives with wood and bone handles. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big excitement of turning 18 for Ray is he doesn&#39;t have to have &quot;parental permission&quot; to do the things he&#39;s been doing for four years - not that it slowed him down, but now and then it was a hassle to have to say &quot;oh, yeah, you need to talk to my parents...&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Other&#39;s quizzing my child","postDate":"1317998566","msgId":47458,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo2bjM1Nis3aWZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo2anU2ays4dDZwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47452,"nextInTopic":47459,"prevInTime":47457,"nextInTime":47459,"topicId":47430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** How good are you at projecting confidence?

ARgh!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nHow good are you at projecting confidence? That seems to be a big factor in this sort of thing. If you&#39;re good at projecting confidence then you can say &quot;oh, that&#39;s not on our agenda right now&quot; or something equally vague and people don&#39;t tend to respond, its when you hesitate and show a lack of assurance that they jump on you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn that sense it may be less a matter of a snappy comeback than learning how to Seem more confident than you feel in the moment. A lot of that has to do with posture and tone and can be learned by learning some physical skill - yoga or self-defense, sword-fighting or even a dance class (or video) can give you the skills to stand up tall, smile and say &quot;that&#39;s what I Love about Homeschooling - we can mix things up a bit!&quot; (or whatever - I&#39;m No Good at snappy comebacks, personally) without opening the door for criticism. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also okay to coach your kids a bit - right before you visit someone if it helps - on how to refuse to answer questions. I&#39;ve made a point of listening to Mo&#39;s schooled friends to know what They say - they get quizzed, too, but they know how to answer! They say &quot;I dunno&quot; in a dull voice and look away. Alternately, they&#39;ll say &quot;I KNOW!&quot; but not actually answer the question, just act indignant. Or they&#39;ll huff and say &quot;I&#39;m Not in School right now!&quot; in that special eye-rolling voice. Mo has picked up some of those tactics on her own, hanging out with school kids - and Ray learned them in school and made heavy use of them once he was out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps me to keep in mind that most adults flat out have No Idea how to talk to children and so they quiz them as a kind of fallback. With Ray, I&#39;d offer other topics &quot;tell grandma about your new xyz&quot;. Mo&#39;s not so conversational, but she&#39;s better at standing up for herself and refusing to answer rude questions. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":391625131,"authorName":"tookute2eat","from":"&quot;tookute2eat&quot; &lt;tookute2eat@...&gt;","profile":"tookute2eat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Other&#39;s quizzing my child","postDate":"1317976460","msgId":47452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo2bWRpYys1c25oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRTUyODUwMzZCQkI1My0xOEQ4LTJEM0E2QFdlYm1haWwtbTEyNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47451,"nextInTopic":47458,"prevInTime":47451,"nextInTime":47453,"topicId":47430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ironically, she has been working the past couple summers for this woman at her nursery! lol.

It used to make me really mad and while it is still frustrating what has ended up happening is my kids choose not to hang out with these kinds of families and my kids have gotten really good at asking questions back like &quot;don&#39;t you know how to use a calculator?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the funniest thing a schooled child said to my kids was that they needed to go to school so they could &quot;learn about their education&quot; !!!!  I laughed so hard and luckily was there and told the other kids that I do not tell them how awful school is for kids and would appreciate it if they would not bother mine about not having to go to school. Kids repeat what their parents say :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 5, 2011, at 6:52 AM, Loretta wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling so bummed today.
