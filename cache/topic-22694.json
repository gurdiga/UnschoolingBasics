I wanted to emphasize two of<br/>\nthe items in your email.<br/>\nFirst is the size of allowance, you are SO right. People get so stuck<br/>\non dollar amounts, and rarely consider the needs or interests of the<br/>\nchild.  The best suggestion I ever read was to look at how much stuff<br/>\ncosts in your area (because as I&#39;ve noticed during our travels, even<br/>\nthe cost of a candy bar varies GREATLY from area to area!) This guy<br/>\nsuggested looking at how much some junk food, a few drinks, and some<br/>\nlittle toys costs. Then add a few dollars to save, amount depending on<br/>\nyour own budget.<br/>\nThe second you mentioned about limiting the time frame. We are trying<br/>\nto get out of debt, and really needed to focus on saving cash for our<br/>\ntrip. Most of the kids were okay with not buying toys or a lot of junk<br/>\nfood (in fact, Emily has been very adamant every time we are<br/>\nshopping), but Josh was very stressed out about it, especially as we<br/>\napproach the release dates of several Wii games. However, when I<br/>\nsuggested that we try it for five months (until the conference date)<br/>\nand reassess, he was more than willing to forgo allowance. Two years<br/>\nago I don&#39;t think he could have agreed to no allowance. <br/>\nFor what it&#39;s worth, Josh was getting about $5 a week, the girls were<br/>\nup to $3. After our time frame, we&#39;ll be reassessing though, and I<br/>\nimagine they&#39;ll be getting more (partly because our debt will be<br/>\nbetter under control)<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think one of the biggest problems with allowances (and we were guilty <br/>\n&gt; of this too) is that the parents give the children a pittance and then <br/>\n&gt; expect them to make good decisions with that tiny amount of $$.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Can you make this &quot;no buying new&quot; experiment have a definite &quot;end date&quot; <br/>\n&gt; so that they children will know when it&#39;s over?

From: chris1962@verizon.net One of the issues I have been pondering in general and now specifically in relation to unschooling is how to approach money ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2000870461\">-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chris1962@...\">chris1962@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the issues I have been pondering in general and now<br/>\nspecifically in relation to unschooling is how to approach money<br/>\nwith kids. We&#39;ve been giving our kids allowances (ages 4 and 7) b/c<br/>\nwe want them to have $$ that belongs to them that we don&#39;t have any<br/>\nsay over how they spend. But then I find I have a hard time keeping<br/>\nmouth shut when they spend 79 cents on what I am pretty sure will<br/>\nbecome another piece of flotsam in our house!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one of the biggest problems with allowances (and we were guilty <br/>\nof this too) is that the parents give the children a pittance and then <br/>\nexpect them to make good decisions with that tiny amount of $$.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent when I was a kid. I got a quarter a week. But the things I <br/>\nwanted when I was that age really didn&#39;t cost much: I could save up <br/>\npretty quickly. I mean---for example: I was getting a DIME an hour for <br/>\nbaby-sitting at 13. When I went up to a quarter an hour, you&#39;d thunk <br/>\nthe world was coming to an end! &lt;bwg&gt; Things were CHEAP! That&#39;s my teen <br/>\nyears, but as a child a quarter was a good it of money. You could get <br/>\ntwo candy bars. A &quot;big&quot; toy was only 4-5 dollars---so saving up didn&#39;t <br/>\ntake long---especially when you could find half of the cost between the <br/>\nsofa cushions or on the street!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway---things cost more now, plus the techno things are so big. <br/>\nDuncan wants a game that costs $65---no matter how hard we look, <br/>\nthere&#39;ll never be nearly that in the sofa cushions!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo IF you&#39;re going to give an allowance, make sure it&#39;s enough to get <br/>\nthem what they&#39;ll want---not necessarily all at once, but what they can <br/>\nreasonably save.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started out giving like $2/week or something like that. The boys <br/>\nwould spend it on two candy bars. The DAY they got it. But if you  <br/>\nthink about it, it kind of makes sense. If they were to try to save, <br/>\nwe&#39;re talking about 6-7 MONTHS to save for a game---IF they don&#39;t spend <br/>\n*any* and IF they&#39;re interested in *that* game still and IF it&#39;s still <br/>\naround and IF....so it&#39;s not unreasonable to think that it would  make <br/>\nmore sense to just go ahead and spend it on something small NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Ben & I talked about upping it *considerably* as all the unschoolers <br/>\nsuggested. So Duncan suddenly got $50/month (I think...Cameron got <br/>\nmore.) instead of $2/week. That was SOOOO doable for him! He could <br/>\nspend a little but save a LOT towards a new game. He could buy 2-3 used <br/>\ngames. He could actually *make decisions* about his money. AND buy a <br/>\ncandy bar! &lt;G&gt; But it was the decision-making that was important!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has made ALL the difference in how he handles money. Of course, it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen overnight! At first he spent every penny, but it very <br/>\nquickly changed to understanding how he could manipulate the funds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you&#39;re going to do the allowance thang, make it worth their while.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been compounded by my and my husband&#39;s recent decision to<br/>\ntry not to buy anything new for a year. We have not imposed this on<br/>\nthe kids though we are really trying to focus more on &quot;collecting<br/>\nexperiences instead of stuff&quot; and the help them take this in.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you make this &quot;no buying new&quot; experiment have a definite &quot;end date&quot; <br/>\nso that they children will know when it&#39;s over? Maybe a small party to <br/>\nshow &quot;we did it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBen and I talked about it when it made some news a few months back. <br/>\nPeople doing it for &quot;fun&quot; and to see how it felt. We did it for YEARS <br/>\nbecause we HAD to. I don&#39;t feel that need anymore. &lt;g&gt; Honorable, but <br/>\nwe&#39;ve &quot;been there.&quot; In fact, other than mattresses, I don&#39;t know of one <br/>\npiece of furniture we&#39;ve ever bought new. Looking around---I can&#39;t see <br/>\none! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there are many kids&#39; games available used too! Dunc&#39;s PS2 was <br/>\nused. GREAT deal! Still expensive, and at $2/week, he could never have <br/>\nbought it. *I* bought it for him, but it was so much more affordable <br/>\nthan brand new---and it works great. He&#39;s saving for a Wii now. It <br/>\nwould be obsolete by the time he saved enough $2/weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo . . . I&#39;m unsure about allowances (they&#39;re not tied to chsores<br/>\nthough we do give them ways to earn extra $$) and deciding on how to<br/>\nshare the family money, how to make consistent decisions about when<br/>\nwe&#39;ll give more $$ to buy something they want but don&#39;t have the $$<br/>\nfor. I guess the rub I see is that for things that or more expensive<br/>\nand that we choose to buy, we are controlling them in saying what<br/>\nwe&#39;ll buy or what we want.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they allowed a say when you waste $4 on a cup of designer coffee? <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat one always cracks me up. Kids can&#39;t buy a $3 toy, but mom can turn <br/>\nright around and buy a $4 cup o&#39; Joe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve just read Ren&#39;s book, Alfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards and am<br/>\ngoing for my 2nd read of Unconditional Parenting! So, I&#39;m on the<br/>\nroad here but really need some guides!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nRUE&#39;s book, but that&#39;s OK---they get mixed up all the time. They even <br/>\nshare a birthday! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter meeting them both, you wouldn&#39;t mistake them again---promise! <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt; Ren&#39;s the LOUD one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
