I hope I am not using unschooling to be lazy<br/>\nand irresponsible.  I have days where I don&#39;t feel well and my boys so end<br/>\nup playing video games all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just so tired of making them sit down and do school at home.  It was<br/>\nhorrible for them and for me.  We have agreed that they at least need to do<br/>\none math thing a day.  They do look up things they want to learn more about,<br/>\nbut they do not like to read unless it&#39;s magna.  We do like to snuggle and I<br/>\nread aloud to them.  Does that sound like unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are so new to this that I still feel lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nJess <br/>\n <br/>\n-------Original Message-------<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen<br/>\nDate: 4/1/2008 11:02:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: when did your kid(s) learn to read?<br/>\n <br/>\n~~is because I<br/>\nknow &#39;unschoolers&#39; in real life who actually just seem to be neglecting<br/>\ntheir kids in some ways. ~~<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that some could use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; as an excuse<br/>\nto be lazy and irresponsible. Maybe. But possibly there are new<br/>\nunschoolers finding their way and haven&#39;t quite made that switch from<br/>\ncoercion and manipulation to connected and mindful.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
