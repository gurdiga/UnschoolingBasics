He was &quot;behind&quot; in a couple of things and &quot;ahead&quot; in others. So it was a messy process. But at the end of a couple of days, I had a notebook organized with the standards that fit my then 5-year-old, now 13-year-old, son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I took the notebook and put it in a drawer. And I have never looked at it again. It was completely irrelevant to how our days were actually unfolding. (Actually, I scavenged the notebook itself to use for something that was actually useful, a couple of years later. . .)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was something I needed to do and then I was done and didn&#39;t need to do it any more or impose it on anyone else -- including my kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if it helps you, get out the scissors and glue! :) <br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n  -<br/>\n  I&#39;ve lost it.... <br/>\n  Posted by: &quot;thisismaggiesemailaddress&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thisismaggiesemailaddress@...\">thisismaggiesemailaddress@...</a>   thisismaggiesemailaddress <br/>\n  Mon Mar 12, 2007 12:16 pm (PST) <br/>\n  has anyone here ever looked at the scopes and sequences or list of <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22137,"nextTopicId":22077}}
