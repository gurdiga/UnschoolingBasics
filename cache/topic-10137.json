On the <br/>\nwhole I agree with your message - access to good food, information, no <br/>\nguilt... Great. I too am fortunate to have genes that keep me thin <br/>\nregardless of how I eat. Adding calories is not a problem. That is not the <br/>\ncase for everyone. Many people (in the  U.S., in my town, in my family) do <br/>\nhave reason to worry about caloric intake. Also, being thin and *looking* <br/>\nfit are not the only issues. We don&#39;t always know what&#39;s going on on the <br/>\ninside. When I started having some serious medical problems , people were <br/>\nshocked - &quot;you&#39;ve always seemed so healthy&quot;. Yes, I always thought I was <br/>\nhealthy too. For me, removing refined sugar from my diet was necessary and <br/>\nleft doctors shaking their heads at how I turned some physical problems <br/>\naround. I wasn&#39;t interested in their path and left allopathic medicine <br/>\nbehind. Do I recommend *everyone* stop eating refined sugar? No. Do I <br/>\nthink some of my problems came from excessive refined sugar intake? Yes. <br/>\nWell I appear to have debated anyway, and that was not my intent. I have <br/>\navoided these discussions for months, because I don&#39;t want to argue about <br/>\nit. I really don&#39;t. <br/>\nHowever, I do have questions, and...<br/>\nMy original question still stands, i.e. does anyone have experience <br/>\nremoving restrictions with their children, and if so what was that like? <br/>\nHow long did it take for the children to settle into making decisions <br/>\nbased on how they feel now, rather than reacting to formerly imposed <br/>\narbitrary restrictions? I would love to go back and not force my eating <br/>\nchoices on my children in their first few years, but alas I can not, so we <br/>\ngo on from here. My husband is amazed that I am able to let them make <br/>\ntheir own decisions now without putting guilt trips on them, knowing how <br/>\nstrongly I feel about eating nutritional, whole foods. The thing is, it <br/>\nmakes total sense to me that I can not force what I believe onto others, <br/>\nincluding my children, and respecting them is just as important as <br/>\nhonoring my (or their) physical body(ies). <br/>\nTo explain my concern just a bit more, in the past, Faye and Annika ate <br/>\nmore of a variety of things (not by force, by choice). Now it seems they <br/>\nare more willing to decline because they know there are other &#39;tastier&#39; <br/>\nthings around that I will not stop them from having, like cookies, cheetos <br/>\nor whatever. (Faye has always been somewhat picky, but now she is ruling <br/>\nout even more.) Again, I think this is somewhat reactive, and I&#39;m trying <br/>\nto trust that it will not be permanent.<br/>\nAny stories from the experience of others are appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nGayle<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s.

I can certainly see how those kind of <br/>\nmessages would contribute to an unhealthy relationship with food. I don&#39;t <br/>\nremember that kind of thing in my house growing up. I think we were all <br/>\npretty ignorant at that time about the ways that sugar might not be a <br/>\ngreat thing to eat in large quantities. I don&#39;t remember being hassled <br/>\nabout my eating. I was always thin and pretty physically fit, so there <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a worry there. <br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm... perhaps that was the part that was lacking - being taught about <br/>\nhealthy choices in eating, eating sweets in smaller quantities and only <br/>\noccasionally being a wiser choice than in large quantities daily. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink my parents were negligent.

It&#39;s just that, when we get talking about food limits, my own <br/>\nexperience suggests to me that the messages kids get about food--what <br/>\nis good and bad, whether they are good or bad for eating certain <br/>\nthings--have been more of a determinant than whether the food was <br/>\navailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS <br/>\nSecondary school education <br/>\nGraduate school education <br/>\nHome school education <br/>\nGraduate school education online <br/>\nHigh school education <br/>\nMiddle school education <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

I have never gotten to the  <br/>\npoint of being able to keep sugary things in the house without eating  <br/>\nmore of them than I feel good about eating, and this is actually a  <br/>\nchallenge for me because my kids like to have some sweets in the  <br/>\nhouse and have very healthy, happy relationships to them, but it is  <br/>\nbetter for ME to have a very limited amount of sugar available, so we  <br/>\nhave had to work on striking a balance there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that my childhood experience necessarily parallels  <br/>\nyours.

I know <br/>\nthat&#39;s normal, but does anyone have experience moving away from those kind <br/>\nof restrictions that can tell me about how long this might last?<br/>\n        Sugar is a health issue for me. I have low blood sugar that may be <br/>\nmoving toward pre-diabetes. Both my parents are now diabetic. Though I <br/>\nbelieve having a healthy attitude about food is the way to go, and not <br/>\nmaking things off limits, this all does make me nervous. Here&#39;s the thing <br/>\nthat I&#39;m aware of: we all need a certain number of calories everyday. The <br/>\nmore that come from sugar and other empty calories, the less that come <br/>\nfrom nutritious calories, unless we overeat. SO, I very much want to <br/>\nbelieve the time will come that they will be finished pushing the old <br/>\nlimits and will make healthy choices for themselves.<br/>\n        As I said, it has not been all bad. I work hard at putting out <br/>\nfruit and vegetable plates, etc. and they are eating them. I&#39;m not <br/>\npanicking here, just looking for some encouragement about the future.<br/>\n        Also, another concern I have is that I was not limited in my sugar <br/>\nintake as a child. I ate pretty much as much as I wanted, and still I have <br/>\nsugar compulsion, though it used to be worse before my health went <br/>\ndownhill.

Illness is more than just<br/>\nthrowing up, or green runny noses. Illness is the body not working properly,<br/>\nand it can&#39;t do that if it&#39;s clogged up with sugars and chemical additives<br/>\nand the like. \r<br/>\n   \r<br/>\n  I&#39;m transitioning to a raw vegan diet right now because I&#39;m sick, and a<br/>\npoor diet has been part of it. While eating SAD (Standard American Diet) I<br/>\nam overweight, have chronic fatique symptoms, depression, bad skin and am<br/>\nprediabetic. When I eat raw, my aches and pains go away, I&#39;m not moody or<br/>\ndepressed, and my skin clears up. \r<br/>\n   \r<br/>\n  My children and I talk often about how foods are fuel for the body, and<br/>\nkeeping the body healthy. They have freedom in what they eat, and most of<br/>\nthe time they choose fruits over sweets.     \r<br/>\n   \r<br/>\n  I hope that helps some!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n  Beth, NC                  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMelissa &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a>&gt; wrote:\r<br/>\n  Why would eating junk food would be associated increasing likelihood  \r<br/>\nof contracting childhood illnesses? unhealthy food does not equal  \r<br/>\nillness, bacteria and virus&#39;s do! \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSing, Dance, Laugh...LOVE!\r<br/>\n            \r<br/>\n---------------------------------\r<br/>\nYahoo!

What I found was that there are people who are  <br/>\nvery allergic to tea tree oil, which is what melaleuca products  <br/>\ncontain. I found that putting it on the skin - as in the bath bars or  <br/>\nlotions - can result in red, burning, itching skin rashes and  <br/>\nswelling. Taking it orally - as in vitamins and other supplements, or  <br/>\nbreathing the fumes of cleaning products containing it, can result in  <br/>\nchildren experiencing drowsiness, muscle weakness, muscle tremors,  <br/>\ndepression, loss of coordination, and difficulty walking.

It should be avoided in  <br/>\npregnant and breast-feeding women and in children. Because it is  <br/>\ntoxic if taken by mouth, tea tree oil should be used only on the  <br/>\nskin. Side effects may include skin dryness or peeling, and allergies  <br/>\nhave been reported. Consult your health care provider immediately if  <br/>\nyou experience side effects.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, here is a site that you can have a look at - it  <br/>\nlists many studies of the effect of tea tree oil.

Of course, I put it off and put it off. I had better things to<br/>\nthink about but eventually as I was using my typical all purpose cleaner -<br/>\nmy favorite back then was 409. I got a headache and sat down with my laptop<br/>\nto check my email and Lynn had sent me an email asking if I had checked the<br/>\nwebsite. I thought no but if it is that important to her I would look into<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I got to the site and looked around for a few minutes thinking there<br/>\nwas too much to look at, then I thought about the cleaner I use and thought<br/>\nI would look just that up. It was really the only thing I used and if it was<br/>\nfine then my son would be fine, right.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could look it up on your own but to save you time I will give it to you.<br/>\nAfter all, we are all busy and that is what kept me from looking in the<br/>\nfirst place.

When I eat raw, my aches and pains go away, I&#39;m not moody or depressed, and my skin clears up. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My children and I talk often about how foods are fuel for the body, and keeping the body healthy.

She is<br/>\nrecently off of medication. So eating healthy is very<br/>\nimportant to us. The trick is to have a lot of healthy<br/>\nchoices available.  We buy lots of whole grain foods<br/>\nand cereals. We bake our own whole wheat flour<br/>\ncookies.<br/>\nWe have baby carrots and cherry tomatoes sitting in<br/>\nthe fridge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot about fibre and protein content of<br/>\nfoods. Sometimes my kids ask for some high-sugar<br/>\nlow-fibre cereals. I buy them, but explain to them<br/>\nthat nutritionally that&#39;s no different than eating<br/>\ncandy. I don&#39;t try to control how much sugar they get,<br/>\nbut I do try to ensure that they get adequate protein<br/>\nand fibre. That does sometimes mean saying &quot;after you<br/>\nfinish your cereal (or PBJ sandwhich...)&quot;. But I think<br/>\nit&#39;s better than saying No.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyone want to comment on the cleaning up after kids<br/>\n&gt; issue?  I have <br/>\n&gt; been doing this for several years.  My children do<br/>\n&gt; not and will not <br/>\n&gt; clean their messes.  It is a ton of work on me. <br/>\n&gt; They don&#39;t care if <br/>\n&gt; our living area is messy.  I believe people function<br/>\n&gt; much better in <br/>\n&gt; a clean environment.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you tried asking for help? It works sometimes. My<br/>\nkids help only if they see a reason to cleanup, namely<br/>\nif we&#39;re going to have company. Or to make room for<br/>\nanother messy game. But honestly, I remember my mother<br/>\nasking me to cleanup what looked to me like a<br/>\nperfectly fine room. And not everyone functions better<br/>\nin a clean environment. I&#39;ve a very high tolerence for<br/>\nmess and can find what I need in my own mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
