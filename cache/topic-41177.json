Soy is actually really nasty tasting, they have to add a lot of sugar to give it<br/>\n a pleasant flavor.  The key here is to be selective on the type of soy you consume and to try to avoid it altogether.  I know it&#39;s harder that it sounds.  There is soy in practically everything.  Also you might want the read the book, &quot;The Whole Soy Story&quot; by nutritionist Kaayla Daniel.  Check out Dr. Mercola&#39;s website and type in soy for more information.  If you&#39;re brave I would encourage you to try raw milk.  My ex-boyfriend is lactose intolerant and I got him hooked on it.  The strange thing is when he drinks raw milk he doesn&#39;t get the stomach pain he would get with pasteurized dairy products.  There are many beneficial enzymes and vitamins in raw milk that are killed during pasteurization.  It even has more vitamin C than orange juice.  I don&#39;t work for a raw milk company I just love it and it tastes great.  If you don&#39;t want to try raw milk, the other alternatives would be almond milk or rice milk.  Although those types of milk don&#39;t<br/>\n really have much more nutritional value than cow&#39;s milk.Hope this helps!  <br/>\nTheresa       <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 9/1/09, Jacque Valdez &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacque.valdez@...\">jacque.valdez@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jacque Valdez &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jacque.valdez@...\">jacque.valdez@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] OT I guess<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, September 1, 2009, 2:22 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  We are lactose intolerant over here and rarely use soy milk only because our<br/>\n<br/>\ndoctor said it was not good for the esophagus but we did use it when my kids<br/>\n<br/>\nwere younger with no issues mind you they didn&#39;t come from malnourished<br/>\n<br/>\ncountry but we use almond milk and rice milk now and occasionally if we can<br/>\n<br/>\npotato milk....I think that stuff is a scare tactic brought on by the dairy<br/>\n<br/>\nassociation kind of like the docs saying we need so many shots every year<br/>\n<br/>\nfor our kid gotta line those pocket books you know LOLJacque<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Tue, Sep 1, 2009 at 11:47 AM, Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@ gmail.com&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Right we know that precocious puberty CAN happen to kids adopted who go<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; from<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; relative starvation (in both amount and nutrient diversity) to our diets.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But this is atypical for little girls, much more common when they are<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; adopted at around 8 or 9.
