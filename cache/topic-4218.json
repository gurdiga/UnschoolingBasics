We did the middle third and, by that time, DD was picking up small books at the library and reading independently. I think she was right on the edge of reading on her own and just needed something to help her consolidate her ideas about her reading. Now she has read her way through our local library branches. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, two different kids, two different experiences.

It was an up and down thing...he&#39;d be fine with it for a while then it might frustrate him for a while. I felt it was more important for him to be comfortable with his own development than to jump on that whole &quot;teachable moment&quot; crap. We explained about how once his body was ready, it would start to make sense and we understood how frustrating it was but we also totally TRUSTED his development as a human being. I explained how sometimes a baby will get frustrated by not being able to walk or talk the way they want, but that eventually it all clicked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe read to him whenever he needed us (for games and such), we even bought him some more adult style readers because he wanted to &quot;practice&quot; (his request) and after trying a bit of it he decided it just frustrated him more. After going through about 2-3 rounds of moderate frustration with the fact that he wanted to read before he COULD, he became very comfortable with it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got a really good glimpse into how school labels and destroys kids who read later, through a neighbor friend. He started reading around the age of 12 and within three months was totally fluent. No lessons, no pushing, nothing but trust and confidence (us first, then him) in the learning process. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time I read everything to him, then he stopped asking so often, then he never needed help. Spelling was the next thing....first he asked me to spell everything and anything, then very little, then nothing. That&#39;s how he mastered it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s in Alaska this summer having grand adventures and all I can say to worried parents is; keep on trusting their unfolding, keep on being confident and joyful in your own learning, keep on bringing in wonderful experiences for your family and all will be well.

How did you help him with that? Or prevent that?<br/>\n--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon never went through a point where he was pushing to read. At least not a point that he talked about. He was willing to let me talk to him about where he was in reading. And when he did read he didn&#39;t know how he did it. He couldn&#39;t say how it went from illegible to legible. It just clicked. Linnaea wanted to read before she was reading. Not much before. She had a friend who could read and she wanted to read like her friend could. We talked about it and I told her that there wasn&#39;t anything I could do to get her reading faster than she was going to read. The only things I could do were things like reading to her more, so we did that. I offered to run my finger under the words as I read them and she liked the idea, but didn&#39;t like the practice of doing so. She decided what she wanted to do about it. Mostly it was relaxing back to where she was before the desire. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Simon I talked at times, in a sideways kind of conversation way, about not knowing how I read. I haven&#39;t a clue how I read, I just do. And when I lived in Japan I just didn&#39;t, unless there was English in the sign. I didn&#39;t press him to read and I happily read for him. I also talked about the things he could see that I didn&#39;t see because I was reading the words. He could find things in video games much more quickly and in other arenas as well, because he wasn&#39;t waiting for a written instruction to tell him what to do or where to look, he was finding other clues. It was amazing to have the pedestal that reading sits upon knocked away. It is just another tool for accessing information. That awareness really changed my tension over the issue and probably kept him from feeling wanting for not being a reader. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":121913750,"authorName":"melanie kuhn","from":"melanie kuhn &lt;umsalayum@...&gt;","profile":"um_salayum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] How do you do it?","postDate":"1247945570","msgId":40779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwOS1XMUE4NjQ2MDYwNThFQUE2QjYwRTYwQTkxRjBAcGh4LmdibD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCODRERjE2LTdFMTUtNEU4My04NUMxLUMwNkNFNERBQUZDREBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGgzcHZ2ZytjcWVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OUI4NERGMTYtN0UxNS00RTgzLTg1QzEtQzA2Q0U0REFBRkNEQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40777,"nextInTopic":40782,"prevInTime":40778,"nextInTime":40780,"topicId":4218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Melissa , I see you have 8 kids , right? wow how do YOU do it?

I had to learn to sit <br/>\nback and be led by them, because I was so pushy with the info (&quot;Did <br/>\nyou know dinosaurs blah blah blah?&quot;) It&#39;s not all bad, but kids know <br/>\nwhen there&#39;s a hidden motive, and they become suspicious.

Ray was like that - he could &quot;sound out&quot; a word but not know what the word was. He could &quot;decode&quot; a short sentence without gaining an atom of meaning. But once he could read he could stop and puzzle his way through an unfamiliar word using the letter-sound cues to help him.

There&#39;s lots of ideas in there about things to do and try. Try to get away from thinking in terms of what may or may not be a good learning opportunity. Learning happens naturally as an extension of living life.

A rich environment doesn&#39;t have to be an expensive one - I outta know! We&#39;ve had some really lean years lately and are only now not feeling the pinch quite so hard. But through the worst of it, we found creative ways to say &quot;yes&quot; to our kids wants, and ways to expand their lives a little. Watching tv together is a valuable resource when the budget is too slim for the family to get out much. Creating projects with simple household supplies is good, too. We did our &quot;fun shopping&quot; at yard sales and did a lot of cooking together. Those things all helped stretch the budget, but they also took us to places, physically and conceptually, we wouldn&#39;t likely have gone before. It didn&#39;t take a lot of inspiration, either. We&#39;d spend some time browsing cookbooks looking for fun things to make, or wander a big yard sale pouring over every little nic-nack and imagining what we&#39;d do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it makes my heart so heavy all the time they ask for something and I have to say NO , we have no money.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I love buying things for my kids!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can be confusing to kids to see parents spend money -  even on gas and food - and then turn around and say &quot;but we&#39;ve no money for you&quot;. It can help to bring them into the process, make the finances a little more transparent. It also helps to find creative ways to say Yes more. Make lists, or a vision board, maybe.

It&#39;s the  <br/>\nidea that children must sit down and be told what is important and in  <br/>\nwhat order it becomes important. In all honestly, kids (no...people!)  <br/>\nare designed to learn! They make connections all the time, and it has  <br/>\namazed me to watch my kids learn because I have also had to  <br/>\nconsciously break the standards that I grew up with in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet them play, watch them, play WITH them (because learning to play  <br/>\nhas been so beneficial for me for unschooling). I had to learn to sit  <br/>\nback and be led by them, because I was so pushy with the info (&quot;Did  <br/>\nyou know dinosaurs blah blah blah?&quot;) It&#39;s not all bad, but kids know  <br/>\nwhen there&#39;s a hidden motive, and they become suspicious. Some kids  <br/>\nlike that, some kids start to resent it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nice to meet you!<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel, Avari, and  <br/>\nbaby Nathan!<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 17, 2009, at 8:57 AM, umsalayum wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How to understand your kids want to learn something , I understand  <br/>\n&gt; playing is learning,<br/>\n&gt; but right now , I&#39;m thinking when will they learn how to read and  <br/>\n&gt; write ?<br/>\n&gt; Do I really just wait , or do I need to make it interesting<br/>\n&gt; for them to want to learn how to read,or other things?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not doing anything at the moment ,I just let them play , watch  <br/>\n&gt; them, help them , and try to be there when they need me or ask me  <br/>\n&gt; questions, is that enough?<br/>\n&gt; Do I really just need to sit back ?<br/>\n&gt; I feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":254934996,"authorName":"duckgirl01","from":"&quot;duckgirl01&quot; &lt;hippytrish@...&gt;","profile":"duckgirl01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do you do it?","postDate":"1247921808","msgId":40775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGgzc2dxZytqZTNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgzcHZ2ZytjcWVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40774,"nextInTopic":40776,"prevInTime":40774,"nextInTime":40776,"topicId":4218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... , I m thinking when will they learn how to read and write ? ...

Sometime in the last year, I noticed that my 6 year old was beginning to read.  He didn&#39;t even realize it himself, and I didn&#39;t really say anything either.  I just realized that through all the things we were doing - video games with words, reading books a ton, and playing - he was beginning to read.  It&#39;s amazing to see unfold, especially in comparison to the school-based method of learning to read.  Don&#39;t get too caught up with ages, though.  Reading and writing will happen in their own time, at the right time for each child.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, the 6 year old has told me he wants to learn to read (as in, soon).  He&#39;s begun to feel motivated to learn it in a more procedural way because he really wants to read books and video game words on his own.  So what I&#39;ve done is first, point out that he *is* reading words sometimes. Second, I&#39;ve begun to teach him reading a little more.  I&#39;m going over a little phonics here and there as we go about our everyday lives - the beginning and ending sounds of words, etc.  I am only doing this as he *wants* the information, though. I&#39;m careful not to turn every incident of reading into some sort of lesson. I ask him sometimes if he wants me to tell him about how particular words go together, etc. In his case, he has the goal of learning to read soonish, so we are going with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep doing what you are doing.  The biggest thing for me is trust in my children and in the nature of humans wanting to learn. If your life is fun and interesting, how could you not want to learn, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nTrish </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":121913750,"authorName":"melanie kuhn","from":"melanie kuhn &lt;umsalayum@...&gt;","profile":"um_salayum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] How do you do it?","postDate":"1247914915","msgId":40774,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwOS1XMzM1QUE3QjYxNjUzQ0NEREZFNUIzMEE5MUYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2MDg3OS4xNzY0My5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGgzcHZ2ZytjcWVkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODYwODc5LjE3NjQzLnFtQHdlYjg2MjAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":40773,"nextInTopic":40775,"prevInTime":40773,"nextInTime":40775,"topicId":4218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, thank you so much for your guys reply!

Sometimes and for some people it is hard to believe that learning is the default position. We learn all the time from lots of different things. I was speaking to a woman a few days ago who kept asking things like, &quot;do you go to the beach so that your children will learn about coastal erosion?&quot; and I had to explain how it might be an outcome of going to the beach, but we go to the beach to go to the beach. Of course the idea that coastal erosion is a key learning point was also a strange one for me, someone who&#39;d grown up in the middle of the U.S., miles from any coastline. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\nSo now I&#39;m waiting for them to come and let me know they want to learn something!?<br/>\nhmm, I was wondering how do you do it?<br/>\nHow to understand your kids want to learn something , I understand playing is learning,<br/>\nbut right now , I&#39;m thinking when will they learn how to read and write ?<br/>\nDo I really just wait , or do I need to make it interesting<br/>\nfor them to want to learn how to read,or other things?<br/>\n-----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they came to you asking to read or to write, what would you be able to do to make that possible? Wanting to read or write does not make a reader. Most of the people who&#39;ve written about children who want to read have said that they&#39;ll sit down and do a few worksheets and then decide that it isn&#39;t working and go and do something else. The worksheets aren&#39;t going to get them reading. And the sitting down and studying how to read isn&#39;t going to get them reading. Both Simon and Linnaea have learned how to read without lessons. Linnaea really got reading at about 6. And that was through exposure to Nintendogs and being read to and playing WoW and other video games and computer games. Words were just a part of her day and she was ready to decipher the code and she did. Simon has just recently started reading. He&#39;s 12. There was a lot of pre-reading stuff going on, but reading fully and independently didn&#39;t happen until around his 12th birthday. It wasn&#39;t<br/>\nwanting that made it so, it was being ready to read, having all the neurological bits lined up so that his brain was aligned with his desire. He had roughly the same environment as Linnaea. If anything his was filled with more written words than hers. But he wasn&#39;t in a position to read until he was 12, or nearly. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe amazing thing for both of them is that they did it without anyone &quot;teaching&quot; them how to read. One of the things that people underline as being so pivotally important, so difficult to master, they did on their own and in their own time. Living in a printed word rich environment, with people happy to read to them when they wanted, and who weren&#39;t pushing them to read, they became literate individuals. The power that they have over their own understanding of the world is amazing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nI&#39;m not doing anything at the moment ,I just let them play, watch them, help them, and try to be there when they need me or ask me questions, is that enough?<br/>\nDo I really just need to sit back ?<br/>\nI feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong!<br/>\n-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNot doing anything isn&#39;t as good as finding cool things that they can do with you. Not pushing them to do things is good though. And being there when they ask for your help or your company is good. But being there before they ask and being there with cool ideas and activities that they can do or turn down, that&#39;s even better.

You&#39;re facilitating their play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are learning to read and write now, but it just doesn&#39;t look  <br/>\nlike it from the outside. Unschooling doesn&#39;t resemble school. It  <br/>\nlooks like play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re learning to read and write in the same way the learned to  <br/>\nspeak. I remember before my daughter spoke, I was carrying her around  <br/>\ntalking to her, not expecting a response. I asked rhetorically where  <br/>\nher hat was. And she pointed to it up on the mantle. Even though it  <br/>\nlooked like little as far as language was concerned was going on, she  <br/>\nobviously understood even if she couldn&#39;t reproduce it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat schools do is try to teach skills out of context. But that&#39;s  <br/>\nhard to do. Context gives meaning and motivation. If someone decided  <br/>\nyou needed to start memorizing Volapük vocabulary and grammar because  <br/>\nthey thought it was important for you to learn, would you find that  <br/>\neasy to do? Just because someone else thought it was important? Just  <br/>\nbecause they believed it would one day be useful for you and you&#39;d  <br/>\nthank them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no reason for a child to read when they don&#39;t yet want to  <br/>\n(or aren&#39;t developmentally able to!) There is no reason for a child  <br/>\nto add 13+28 unless they have a real reason to. (For some kids the  <br/>\nreason might be because it&#39;s fun. For most kids the reason will look  <br/>\nmore like wondering if they have enough money for two toys that cost  <br/>\n$13 and $28.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you need to trust is that these basic skills are as basic to  <br/>\nlife as speaking is. Read to your kids. Listen to books on tape.  <br/>\nWatch movies based on books. Answer their questions. Turn on the  <br/>\nclosed captions on the TV *if they think that&#39;s cool*. Find (or help  <br/>\nthem find) walkthroughs for their video games online (if they want  <br/>\nyou to). Make their experience with the printed word pleasant and  <br/>\nthey will read when two conditions are met: they are developmentally  <br/>\nable to and they need to. For writing, make sure there are writing  <br/>\nimplements and paper readily available. Offer to write down their  <br/>\nstories for them. Make as big a production out of it as *they* want  <br/>\nto. (It may just be written on a piece of paper, typed into the  <br/>\ncomputer, printed out so they can illustrate it, gathered together in  <br/>\na book.) Let them tape record their stories. Let them tell you. You  <br/>\ntell stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle of it will look like it&#39;s leading directly to reading or  <br/>\nwriting. No one thing is important but the whole pile gathered  <br/>\ntogether is. It&#39;s all building the foundation that they&#39;ll be able to  <br/>\nbuild on when they&#39;re able and want to. If a child is building a  <br/>\ngeneric Lego tower, no one Lego is important. But having a pile of  <br/>\nthem readily available is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So now I&#39;m waiting for them to come and let me know they want to  <br/>\n&gt; learn something!?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, don&#39;t wait. But don&#39;t teach either!<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware of what they&#39;re interested in and provide access to more and  <br/>\nrelated things. Just as you might do for your husband. If you knew he  <br/>\nwas in to classic cars you might send him an article or auto show you  <br/>\nstumbled across.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrew their lives with interesting things that they may or may not  <br/>\npick up. Keep the doors open so that when they&#39;re ready for a new  <br/>\ninterest, there are interesting places to explore.

Should I be worried<br/>\nabout <br/>\nthis?  What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>\ntemporary situation?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry about your dad.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad died of bone cancer four years ago when my son Dylan was eight. <br/>\nWe took care of him at home.  It&#39;s such an emotionally exhausting time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTake comfort that your son loves video games and enjoys his time playing.<br/>\n It is so wonderful that he has something to do when you can&#39;t be right<br/>\nthere with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to him.   Make sure he knows things will be different - you *will*<br/>\nhave more time one day.  As you said this is a temporary situation. <br/>\nMaybe even make plans for a special trip.  Let both of you have something<br/>\npositive to focus on.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have a few free hours do something different.  Take him out to<br/>\nlunch.  Go to the park and throw a Frisbee around.  Wander around the<br/>\nbook store, test drive Jeeps, go to the shooting range.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour life and your son&#39;s life will move forward from this point, even<br/>\nthough it doesn&#39;t feel that way now.  Things will be ok.  But make every<br/>\neffort to make the time you do spend with your son as positive as it can<br/>\nbe.  Even if you&#39;re just sitting beside him while he plays a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Getting the teens to help is work in itself. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp like, around the house?  Could you hire a neighborhood teen or<br/>\nsomeone to come in and help out?  I know it would be an expense but now<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re so stressed and worn out it would be a much more peaceful and<br/>\neffective solution than trying to get people to help who don&#39;t really<br/>\nwant to.   You really don&#39;t need the added stress of a domestic power<br/>\nstruggle.  Do what you can to avoid that.   Is there a homeschooler you<br/>\nknow who would tidy up for you in exchange for something?   <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk more from your partner.  These are special circumstances and he *can*<br/>\ngive a little more, temporarily.  Wouldn&#39;t you be willing to do the same<br/>\nfor him?  Let him know what you need.  My own husband felt really lost<br/>\nwhen we were taking care of my dad.  He really didn&#39;t know what would<br/>\nhelp me the most.  It helped him (and me!) a lot when I just told him<br/>\nwhat I wanted him to do.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remember some of household stuff probably isn&#39;t as important to your<br/>\nfamily members as it is to you.  Talk to them about it, I&#39;ll bet they<br/>\nreally don&#39;t care if dishes sit a few days.  Let them sit if you can&#39;t<br/>\nget to them.   Maybe even switch to paper plates and plastic disposable<br/>\nbowls and plastic utensils.   Do whatever it takes to make your load<br/>\nlighter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep thinking.  Write me off list if you want.  I&#39;m so sorry for<br/>\nwhat you&#39;re going through, but it will change.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"How do you do it?","postDate":"1102291091","msgId":4218,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNwMDdhaitmb2Q1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4231,"prevInTime":4217,"nextInTime":4219,"topicId":4218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I have a question that has partly to do with the unschooling way of life and partly to do with life management.  Here goes... Some of you may already","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1012071033\">Well, I have a question that has partly to do with the unschooling <br/>\nway of life and partly to do with life management.  Here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you may already know some of these details.  In the interest <br/>\nof understanding I am sharing for a clearer picture of where I am <br/>\ncoming from.  Details...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seven children, five step and two biological.  My oldest is <br/>\n18 and starting Dorsey Business school.  She, as well as the five <br/>\nsteps, were/are public schooled.  They all, minus one of the 17-year-<br/>\nold twins, live at home full time.  Tabitha, Pat&#39;s oldest, is <br/>\nstarting Macomb in January.  Tammi and Tracey are both at the local, <br/>\nyuck, high school.  They graduate this school year.  Amie and <br/>\nAndrew, Pat&#39;s two youngest, both attend at the local charter, also <br/>\nyuck but better, school.  Adrian, my youngest, is unschooled.  He <br/>\nhas been since January of this year.  Before that he was school at <br/>\nhomed, and before that public school for 2.5 years, and before that <br/>\nschool at homed.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe used to be in business for ourselves.  He closed the shop in the <br/>\ninterest of destressing and just pulling a check every week.  Pat is <br/>\na transmission mechanic.  It&#39;s not too promising where he is <br/>\nemployed right now.  (He hasn&#39;t been paid in four weeks.)  He&#39;s in <br/>\nthe process of opening our shop back up.  This means long hours and <br/>\nvery late nights.  Topping this off, my dad is dying of breast <br/>\ncancer.  My step-sister and myself are sharing the responsibility of <br/>\ncaring for him, that is as long as she&#39;s not employed.  She&#39;s <br/>\ncurrently looking for a job.  This is taking up at least four days <br/>\nof my week.  Relying on the teens is difficut, and caring for the <br/>\nyounger ones is demanding.  Our unschooling life was already being <br/>\ninterrupted throughout the day in relation to the public school <br/>\nschedule.  It&#39;s like adding a part-time job to an already very <br/>\ndemanding lifestlye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrian is 10 years old.  He is what I believe to be a Highly <br/>\nSensitive Child.  He would be considered introverted, but outspoken, <br/>\nby many.  He spends the majority of his time playing PS2 and <br/>\nstrategy games on the PC.  He enjoys Adult Swim and gross cartoons <br/>\non the PC.  :)  It&#39;s his desire to be a video game designer and <br/>\ncritic.  He&#39;s definately a &quot;boy&quot; when it comes to the outdoors.  He <br/>\nloves BB and pellet guns.  His souvenir from Wisconsin was a new CO2 <br/>\ngun purchased with his own money.  The highlight for him for the <br/>\ntrip was seeing a mother bear and her cub in my step-sister&#39;s <br/>\nyard/woods.  His favorite place to be is my grandparent&#39;s farm, not <br/>\nour very tiny city lot at home.  He really doesn&#39;t have any <br/>\nfriends.  Also, something else that I try to not let bother me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern is this.  I have a signifigant other that can&#39;t help me <br/>\nwith much of anything due to his personal schedule and life <br/>\ndemands.  Getting the teens to help is work in itself.  Most <br/>\nimportantly, to me, is my unschooled son.  Should I be worried about <br/>\nthis?  What have you done in this type of uncontrolable and <br/>\ntemporary situation?  How did you make it through?  What do you <br/>\nthink you would do, or how do you think you would handle it?  Do I <br/>\nneed to just chill and not worry about it?  I welcome all wisdom, <br/>\ntried or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot for reading this far...<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40766,"nextTopicId":40780}}
