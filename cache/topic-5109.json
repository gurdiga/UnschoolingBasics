I love my children with all my<br/>\nheart.  I want them to grow up to be happy, healthy and strong in all<br/>\naspects of life.  Now is a time when I need to apply the saying, &quot;I did what<br/>\nI knew; then when I knew better, I did better.&quot;  That helps me to not beat<br/>\nmyself up over poor choices I amy have made in the past (I&#39;m really good at<br/>\nbeating myself up).  I am very much a show-me person.  I am a natural<br/>\nskeptic.  But I also know that I am not perfect, and I will not get any<br/>\nbetter if I don&#39;t view new ideas with an open mind.  It also helps if I am<br/>\nshown how to take the first couple of steps so I know that I have the right<br/>\nidea.  My personal learning method is to hear of or read mention of an idea,<br/>\nthen read about it and think about the logic behind the idea, then look for<br/>\nscientific evidence or lots of anecdotal evidence, and finally to try it for<br/>\nmyself.  I think I am ready to make that last step.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Liza, Noah, Cricket, and Lucy Gottlieb<br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lizarosegottlieb@...\">lizarosegottlieb@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, March 15, 2005 10:36 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] re:structure<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow!!
