No mystery, but just a different <br/>\nexpectation on the parent&#39;s part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say, &quot;when I felt she wasn&#39;t hearing me,&quot; I assume you are <br/>\ndoing a similar thing and are observing your child&#39;s reaction (i.e. <br/>\nclues) to assess if she heard you or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my clients I first just assume they have heard me when I give <br/>\nthem instructions.  I admit that it is tempting to ask if they <br/>\nunderstood me, but I find that it is more gentle and respectful if I <br/>\nam patient and give them the benefit of the doubt.  If they didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand or hear me, then I know it pretty quickly when they begin <br/>\nan exercise and they are not following my instructions <br/>\n(the `clue&#39;).   In this case, I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it.  I <br/>\nwill do one or several things to help them understand.  Sometimes, I <br/>\nwill just repeat what I said.  Other times, I sense that a child <br/>\ndoes better by watching me, so I will demonstrate with as few words <br/>\nas possible.  Other times, I find it&#39;s best to let them be and make <br/>\ntheir own discoveries of what works best for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith my clients I have the luxury of waiting for the child to <br/>\nnaturally demonstrate his understanding.

It is amazing how learning to look at it through you children&#39;s eyes begins to change so much!!!  Just the other day I was getting my 4 year old in the car to go away.  As he was getting in , both my mom and I had said that we wanted him to come with me so he could help me (I was taking some furniture over to a friends)..Anyway in the conversation it was mentioned that our friend had a boy that would help us... Ian all of a sudden got very upset and was making it difficult for me to put him in his seat belt.  Now I couldn&#39;t quite figure out what was the matter but thank goodness for grandmother&#39;s  preserverance because she finally got him to say that he didn&#39;t want the other boy helping his mama.  OK there&#39;s the problem.  from there she refocused his attention on helping me get the jeep backed out of the driveway and re-assured him that he was my helper....

It _is_ more difficult for the person doing the talking to <br/>\nget a good feel if someone has processed what they are saying <br/>\nwithout getting the eye contact along with it.

This post helped me see the flow of the conversation from <br/>\nhis side. While I didn&#39;t intend to make it an either/or thing it seems to <br/>\nhave felt like that to him because for some odd reason I was thinking we <br/>\nwere going to bring the cookies home and eat them.

I just thought he was opting for &quot;going home and eating cookies&quot; <br/>\nwhich is the way I was imagining it. You&#39;re right - huge language barrier. <br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m surprised at how verbal he is and then how we still <br/>\noccasionally struggle when we talk to each other.

This<br/>\n&gt;store has<br/>\n&gt;a few different coin operated rides in front so I dug up enough<br/>\n&gt;quarters to<br/>\n&gt;ride 3 rides. He liked this idea and carried the quarters the whole<br/>\n&gt;time we<br/>\n&gt;were in the store preparing for his riding adventure. When we were<br/>\n&gt;through<br/>\n&gt;at the store (maybe a 5-minute shopping trip), we went outside and I<br/>\n&gt;asked<br/>\n&gt;him which ride he wanted to ride first. His response was, &quot;cookies&quot;. I<br/>\n&gt;said,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;yes, we got the cookies already and here they are in the bag.&quot; He just<br/>\n&gt;sat<br/>\n&gt;there and stared. I asked again which one he wanted to ride and he just<br/>\n&gt;kept<br/>\n&gt;saying, &quot;cookies&quot;. I took him to the one that&#39;s usually his favorite (a<br/>\n&gt;helicopter) and started to lead him up to the steps into it but he<br/>\n&gt;protested<br/>\n&gt;and said, &quot;cooooookieeeees&quot;. So I said, &quot;okay, let&#39;s go home and eat<br/>\n&gt;cookies&quot; and we walked on our way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So, in his little mind, he said, &quot;cookies,&quot; and y&#39;all walk to get the<br/>\n&gt;cookies. You GET the cookies and he says, &quot;cookies&quot; and you say,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says,<br/>\n&gt;&quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;helicopter.&quot; He says, &quot;cookies.&quot; You say, &quot;Let&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;go home to eat cookies.&quot; He says,&quot; OK.&quot;---probably thinking that you<br/>\n&gt;can go BACK to the store for the helicopter (like you went BACK to the<br/>\n&gt;store for the cookies).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;He seemed just fine until we got to our<br/>\n&gt;block about 3 houses from our home. He started to cry and asked for the<br/>\n&gt;helicopter. I said that I was sorry but we were home now and it was too<br/>\n&gt;dark<br/>\n&gt;and far to turn back (we&#39;re not in the *safest* neighborhood and it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;about<br/>\n&gt;a 15-minute walk to the store). He freaked out and just started<br/>\n&gt;crying/sobbing/screaming for the helicopter. I kept explaining how we<br/>\n&gt;were<br/>\n&gt;too far from the store and it was already dark, etc., etc.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So then he says &quot;helicopter&quot; and you talk gibberish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  When we got into<br/>\n&gt;the house he knocked a dining room chair down onto the floor and then<br/>\n&gt;threw<br/>\n&gt;himself down onto the floor and started banging his head! He&#39;s never<br/>\n&gt;done<br/>\n&gt;this before. I guess I&#39;ve seen other kids throw &quot;tantrums&quot; before but<br/>\n&gt;my<br/>\n&gt;son&#39;s &quot;tantrums&quot; seem to only last for about a minute and I actually<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;consider him throwing true tantrums until tonight. I couldn&#39;t take the<br/>\n&gt;head<br/>\n&gt;banging and got down on the ground with him and offered to nurse him<br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;he accepted and seemed to begin to calm down a bit. We talked about how<br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;could go ride the helicopter in the morning when it would be light<br/>\n&gt;outside<br/>\n&gt;and he seemed to be pleased with that - although still not fully<br/>\n&gt;satisfied,<br/>\n&gt;I think.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Jeezus!

It<br/>\n&gt;seems<br/>\n&gt;to be when he is offered the opportunity to do something and maybe<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;have enough time to process the choices.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Or he&#39;s not understanding why, when he says &quot;cookies,&quot; you&#39;re offering<br/>\n&gt;a helicopter.

So why don&#39;t you  <br/>\n&quot;lead&quot; him and make decissions for him as long as he needs to. For  <br/>\nsuch a young child too many options might be too overwhelming, and  <br/>\ntime is not relevant yet and maybe not really something he can take  <br/>\ninto account. He lives in &quot;NOW&quot;. I dunno where, but I read that  <br/>\nsomeone would just decide for their very youngest in such a way: &quot;ok,  <br/>\nnow you can have a ride on the blue one&quot;. if that is ok with the  <br/>\nchild and he is happy with it, you don&#39;t need to give other options.  <br/>\nIf the child would say &quot;no, but I want the red one&quot;, then you&#39;d say  <br/>\n&quot;ok, then, the red one, let&#39;s go!&quot;. You take the information  <br/>\navailable for you at the time to make the best decission for your  <br/>\nvery young child, as he seems not able to do so yet. But as soon you  <br/>\nsee he is actually starting to see the different choises he has and  <br/>\nwants to make use of them, he WILL say it and THEN you have new  <br/>\ninformation and can use it to AGREE (saying yes). As he grows, he  <br/>\nwill want to make more and more decissions when he is able to handle  <br/>\nit and he will show it when the time is right. If you don&#39;t fight it  <br/>\nTHEN I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad to make choises now for him, as long as  <br/>\nyou take into account the information you have (about his favourite  <br/>\nrides, favourite cookies etc, what he likes, needs etc).

Sometimes he does this when daddy <br/>\nis going to work and my son is engaged in something else (cars, watching a <br/>\nTV show, playing outside, etc.). I&#39;ll remind him that daddy is going to work <br/>\nand ask if he wants to say goodbye or give a hug/kiss and he&#39;ll be so <br/>\nengrossed in the activity that he either doesn&#39;t hear me or decides to stay <br/>\nwith the activity instead (my husband will even give him a kiss that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to notice). As soon as daddy pulls out of the driveway, my son <br/>\nruns to the door and starts crying that he didn&#39;t get a chance to say <br/>\ngoodbye...<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m looking for another way to see this sort of situation or another <br/>\nway to present all his options to him along with enough time to choose to <br/>\nhis satisfaction. Like I said, he doesn&#39;t do this all the time but I want to <br/>\nanticipate this in the future when he&#39;s faced with choices between things he <br/>\nreally likes to do (and I&#39;m not trying to make his choices either/or sorts <br/>\nof things, by the way). Thanks for any ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Method� of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N\">http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N</a><br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWindows Live Spaces is here!
