There always seem to<br/>\nbe tutor type people around homeschool groups - former teachers who<br/>\nare now homeschooling or dads who have a knack for a particular<br/>\nsubject.  See if you can find someone who can explain algebra in a way<br/>\nthat makes sense to her.  In the movie Big (Yeah, I keep bringing that<br/>\nup LOL!) Tom Hanks&#39; character is at this dinner party and the host&#39;s<br/>\nson keeps popping in asking for help with his school work.  Algebra<br/>\ncomes up and Tom&#39;s character (who is just a 13yo boy trapped in a 30<br/>\nyo body) says, &quot;Oh, I know math&quot; and he goes and shows the boy how<br/>\ndoing algebra is a lot like baseball.  &quot;ding ding ding ding ding&quot;<br/>\nsuddenly it all makes sense.  Algebra never made sense to me until<br/>\nsomeone showed me how it worked in a physical way (using blocks to<br/>\nshow me how algebra was just completing sets to make whole figures all<br/>\nthose x&#39;s and b&#39;s and a&#39;s were just the negative spaces)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also might help your daughter to talk through why she feels that<br/>\nalgebra is important to her.  Have you both read the Teenage<br/>\nLiberation Handbook?  Might be helpful and insightful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143297451,"authorName":"blestmomma","from":"&quot;blestmomma&quot; &lt;blest.momma@...&gt;","profile":"blestmomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Learning Different 13yog and Math","postDate":"1155792229","msgId":16533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjMHVoNStiOWEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16535,"prevInTime":16532,"nextInTime":16534,"topicId":16533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you to those who took time to respond.  :)  I understand that just everyday life presents itself with numbers and problems that causes us to have to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-696289507\">Thank you to those who took time to respond.  :)  I understand that <br/>\njust everyday life presents itself with numbers and problems that <br/>\ncauses us to have to reason.  That is how I always saw it.  To me that <br/>\nis plenty of math.  But my daughter is very goal, schedule, and text-<br/>\nbook type focused.  The only time I ever bought her a text book was at <br/>\nher request.  She wants a high school diploma and be done with Algebra <br/>\n2 by the time she is 15.  I don&#39;t agree with her, I think she is <br/>\nmisguided by false notions.  We have talked about this at great length <br/>\nover the years and she still wants to be and live and COMPLETE things <br/>\nquickly.  What am I to do?  The only thing I can figure out, is to <br/>\nsuppot her.  How do I help her get to where SHE WANTS to be in the <br/>\nnext 2 years if she is so far behind?
