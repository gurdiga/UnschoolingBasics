This is one of the things dh and I ended up discussing last night. He was talking about oh I loved it in Gt. We got to get out the telescopes and microscopes and go out and look at the eclipse......etc. My opinion...So if a test says you arent gt then you shouldnt be looking at microscopes? If a kid wants to work with a microscope then buy, borrow, find one in a childrens museum....or at the very least look at pics of prepared slides online, how microscopes work, etc. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think Courtney&#39;s feeling are somewhat similiar to that. I think that she dosent want to be Required to do more/ harder work. She knows if there is something that interests her Ill do all I can to help her gain the info she wants. Im just fine with this :) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\n Everyone is raving about the  all-new Yahoo!
