We have been using this <br/>\n1st grade  curriculum, and she is able to do it, slowly. but she has <br/>\nno desire. I  have stopped doing it wih her bc she resisted so much.  <br/>\nI am trying  to make sure we read during the day as well.  But, will <br/>\nshe learn to  read this way?  <br/>\n<br/>\nStacey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n <br/>\nStacey, I&#39;m not quite sure what you meant by &quot;isn&#39;t interested in  reading&quot;.  <br/>\nDo you mean she doesn&#39;t want to read herself or that she isn&#39;t  interested in <br/>\nbooks?<br/>\n <br/>\nEveryone has done a good job on the first one.  So much brain and  muscle <br/>\ncoordination goes into reading.  Perhaps her brain isn&#39;t developed  in those <br/>\nareas quite as much and it is tiring to read.  Would you get  worried if she <br/>\nwasn&#39;t walking at 11 months or doing jumping jacks at 5?<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for not being interested in books, my oldest child has very little  <br/>\ninterest in books.  And in our culture, that seems to be some sort of  cardinal sin. <br/>\n But is it really?  I&#39;ve learned that it is intellectual  superiority.....and <br/>\nbelieve me I grew up with a good dose of that.  Books  are just one part of <br/>\nthe glorious world we live in.  Many of us love books  and we got so much <br/>\npraise for that.  I drive past our elementary school and  the sign out front says <br/>\n&quot;READ!  READ!  READ!&quot;  Ugh, I don&#39;t even  want to read after that.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband doesn&#39;t like books.  He will read magazines and the  internet.  It <br/>\ntook me a long time to get over that, I kept trying to get  him to read.  I <br/>\nrealized there were two issues I had.  First, I wanted  him to read because I <br/>\nbelieved that book-readers are better than everyone  else.  I have lots of <br/>\nsupport in that belief system, and I had to dismantle  it.  Second, I wanted to <br/>\ndiscuss books with him.  Well, that wasn&#39;t  going to happens so I had to learn <br/>\nto discuss books with other people and find  other things that we both enjoyed <br/>\nfor discussion.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt took much work for me to accept my husband&#39;s dislike of books.  It  can <br/>\ntake much work to accept your children&#39;s like and dislike of books....or  <br/>\nanything else.....especially when you have become a homeschooler and are  <br/>\nresponsible for their &quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s OK.  But the joy and fun and ease of unschooling will be yours  once <br/>\nyou can let go of the baggage and celebrate what your children are  interested <br/>\nin!  Let go and have fun!  They are so young and they truly  have a lifetime <br/>\nto learn to read and do math and learn who George Washington  was.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAsk your daughter about her interests and watch her face light up.   Yes, I <br/>\nknow it is hard to get really excited about what Barbie or the Care Bears  are <br/>\nup to, but if you can begin to listen to her, you will see all the amazing  <br/>\nthings she is learning without anybody making her learn!!  It is way cooler  <br/>\nthan sitting at the kitchen table doing reading exercises.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6641,"nextTopicId":6669}}
