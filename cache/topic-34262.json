I<br/>\nwant to give them the best start in life, and partly from discussions<br/>\nhere, I realize that control and restriction brings about what your are<br/>\nafraid of or worried about. I used to know this but somehow when I<br/>\nlanded with kids (and my every move was scrutinized) I fell back on<br/>\n&quot;conventional wisdom&quot; (or &quot;how my mom did it&quot; more like) or something.<br/>\nIn any case, it makes sense to me that if I try to restrict or control<br/>\nit&#39;s like playing tug-of-war: they pull against the restriction and it<br/>\nmakes them go toward what I&#39;m trying to keep them from. So no restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern is that I know that I am not modeling health because I don&#39;t<br/>\nfeel healthy, and neither do most of the other significant role models<br/>\nin their family (their grandmother and mother foremost amongst them,<br/>\naccording to their own words).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my original question wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;shouldn&#39;t I continue to control<br/>\ntheir food because I still have some worries...&quot; it was &quot;does anyone<br/>\nhave any ideas how I can best deal in a situation where I am concerned<br/>\nthat the kids are not getting the best role models (particularly with<br/>\nregard to food and TV)?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a quote from Sandra Dodd&#39;s web site:<br/>\n&quot;Moving Toward Less Control, Concerning Food<br/>\nSandra Dodd, responding...<br/>\n&quot;Talking about different types of foods, *modeling healthy eating<br/>\nbehaviors*, and helping them choose (rather than choosing for them) will<br/>\nenable them to make the right choices for themselves.&quot; [my emphasis added]<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel confident of my understanding of the dynamic described in the<br/>\nrest of the page (how humans react when restrictions are loosened and<br/>\nthen eventually balance out).

I was totally upfront with them about it; I also often share things with them that I read on this list - they are in 100% agreement!  And whenever I slip back into &quot;telling&quot; them what to do, or trying to manipulate them into something and I catch myself, I&#39;ll say something about it to them - we had a pretty good relationship[ before, but I can see more trust and joy in it, and more willingness on their part to share things with me :-)  Also there&#39;s more willingness on *my* part to see what are my issues (cleaning the house) and not feel resentful that I am washing the dishes or cleaning the bathroom *again* - actually one of the girls washed (some of) the dishes the other day, totally on her own - there&#39;s just a whole different dynamic going around!
