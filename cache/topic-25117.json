Dave&#39;s just too<br/>\nding dang funny to let go of!<br/>\nI treat bible talk just as I would someone making reference to any other<br/>\nmythology book - we&#39;ve watched countless things that refer to the Iliad and<br/>\neven Chaucer&#39;s Canterbury Tales. The Bible and THE God they discussed didn&#39;t<br/>\ncarry inordinate weight, because it just doesn&#39;t in our life. It was great<br/>\nfodder for conversation and silly music. By the time the stories were over,<br/>\nthe kids were gone on to something else and missed the little wrap-up bible<br/>\nverse/morality spiel at the end. Fine by me, either way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a woman of strong faith. It&#39;s a whirly-swirly faith that can&#39;t be<br/>\ncontained or specified. Definitely a theist (I&#39;d prefer to be polytheistic<br/>\nover monotheistic - I like the idea of a team approach :::vbg:::). The only<br/>\nabsolute in my heart is there are no absolutes. I&#39;m not offended by others&#39;<br/>\nbeliefs, even if they aren&#39;t mine. I like to try on ideas like new clothes.<br/>\nI&#39;m as in love with Catholicism for my need of ancient ritual as I am with<br/>\nthe UU faith for it&#39;s freedoms. Neither meet my universal need to connect,<br/>\nso I take that on my own self-- the world a la carte :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was cool to introduce these cultural stories to my kids (I really did<br/>\nlike Esther, too) and have discussions about them, free from the feeling of<br/>\n*have to* when it comes to personal individual beliefs. (I think that *have<br/>\nto* when it comes to church/faith/beliefs is what destroys our individual<br/>\nrelationship with the principles behind church/faith/beliefs -- whatever<br/>\nhappened to free will?? :::g::: alas, I&#39;ll take *that* discussion to my<br/>\nblog)<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, they may be offensive to some.

That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m curious about showing religion and  <br/>\nspirituality and all that stuff to my kids, but I&#39;m not sure how to, so I had at  <br/>\none time wondered about Veggie Tales. I am a Pantheist myself, raised by a  <br/>\nserious Atheist and a Nontheist/Agnostic. I was raised to be a dabbler, have  <br/>\nbeen Pagan and at age 10, due to my severe guilt of being a white girl that has  <br/>\na 100% German background, I decided to become Jewish ;) Pantheism seems to be <br/>\na  good thing for me - my heart is happy, as am I. So I do some things, and <br/>\ndiscuss  holidays with the kids as they come, I discuss the idea of being <br/>\n&quot;culturally  Christian&quot; (why we have a tree and do some Easter things) and try to <br/>\nkeep the  discussion open so we can talk, but I fear I am almost keeping them <br/>\nfrom  things...No, that&#39;s not the right way to put it. I want to &quot;teach&quot; (lol, <br/>\nshow,  really, or have available) stuff about other religions, I answer <br/>\nquestions as  they come, such as &quot;Why does that lady have that on he head?&quot; kinda <br/>\nstuff,  but...I guess I&#39;m just curious how this might be shown in other <br/>\nfamilies. I  mainly just try to remain open and talkative, kwim? Sorry for the novela <br/>\nlength  post, lol...<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Veggie Tales","postDate":"1185228777","msgId":25117,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4Mzk1OStnaGU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25119,"prevInTime":25116,"nextInTime":25118,"topicId":25117,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think I just figured out why some of you  may not think Veggie Tales extremely Christian in nature.
