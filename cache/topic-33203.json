In other words, I might say,  <br/>\naloud, but to myself, &quot;I&#39;m think Johnny would love to play with this,  <br/>\nI&#39;m going to offer it to him.&quot; Let the kids be immersed in a world in  <br/>\nwhich thinking of each others&#39; needs is the norm and they will &quot;join  <br/>\nthe club.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I&#39;d invite my kids to be part of my own thinking about other  <br/>\npeople. VERY often I&#39;d ask one kid if she thought the other would like  <br/>\nsomething. Still do that. Last night Rosie and I stopped on our way  <br/>\nhome for her to get some taquitos at a place she especially likes. I  <br/>\nasked, &quot;Do you think Roxana would like some?&quot; Rosie said, &quot;Yes, I  <br/>\nthink so, let&#39;s get some for her, too. But no guacamole.&quot; This is an  <br/>\neveryday - many times a day - type of interchange that started when  <br/>\nthey were very little.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle kids need to have their own needs met - need to be confident  <br/>\nthat their needs are being carefully considered and cared for - before  <br/>\nthey can think about others. But they CAN think about others and they  <br/>\ncan enjoy the &quot;grown-up&quot; feeling that it gives them to be included in  <br/>\nthat kind of consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids were still very very young when they started to really  <br/>\nenjoy giving gifts, for example. That is a great way for them to  <br/>\ndevelop the ability to think from another person&#39;s perspective. If you  <br/>\ngo to a store to pick out a gift for their sister/brother or a friend,  <br/>\nthey often pick out something THEY want. Sometimes it helps to say,  <br/>\n&quot;Hey, let&#39;s get that for you, because you&#39;d love it. Now, what do you  <br/>\nthink your friend would love?&quot; If you I couldn&#39;t afford to get it, I&#39;d  <br/>\nsay, &quot;I&#39;m putting that on YOUR gift list, because I think you&#39;d really  <br/>\nlove it. Now, what do you think your friend would want us to put on  <br/>\nher gift list?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLots and lots of this kind of thinking aloud and conversation in fun  <br/>\nways about other people&#39;s needs was really helpful, I think. What was  <br/>\nNEVER helpful and probably counterproductive was when I was annoyed  <br/>\nthat a child seemed to be uncaring about other people&#39;s needs. If we  <br/>\ntry to make them care about others, we make them dig in their heels  <br/>\nand focus even more on themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, thinking about others became natural to them and, although  <br/>\nthey (we) may behave inconsiderately or selfishly at various times  <br/>\nthroughout our lives, what feels &quot;right&quot; to them is to be considerate  <br/>\nand thoughtful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"[SPAM?]  Re: [unschoolingbasics] new thread - teenagers, stealing, under-age dri","postDate":"1213100293","msgId":33704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcybHJlNStzNGM1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5NERCQTg4OTQ3RDQ4NkFCQ0YxRjI0RkM3RUFFQzVBQGp1ZHlQQz4="},"prevInTopic":33702,"nextInTopic":33710,"prevInTime":33703,"nextInTime":33705,"topicId":33203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... sight, was needed.

People become selfish  <br/>\nwhen they feel they need to fight to get their needs met. If she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need to fight to get her needs met, she&#39;ll be full enough to  <br/>\nbe generous with her energy to take others&#39; needs into consideration.  <br/>\n(When she&#39;s developmentally able!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now she&#39;s feeling you fight against her desire to stay up so  <br/>\nshe&#39;s fighting as hard as she can to get that need met.

We can only present our own ideas about why we think &quot;tagging&quot; the washrooms at the school was not OK and why we think that tagging people&#39;s personal property is not OK - in the end we can&#39;t actually insert our morals into his head.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think there has been some plus sides to this - one thing is that his mom is paying more attention to both of the boys which is a good thing - also he has now constructed a huge graffiti wall in the back yard (we supplied the materials, he did the rest) - <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: keetry <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 09, 2008 9:11 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [SPAM?] Re: [unschoolingbasics] new thread - teenagers, stealing, under-age drinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Judy R&quot; &lt;jroberts@...&gt; <br/>\n  wrote:<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; As a follow - up , the principal called in the police and he and <br/>\n  his mom had to go to see the community policing officer, or whatever <br/>\n  she&#39;s called - turns out she was very reasonable, but firm and <br/>\n  although the principal of the school wanted to charge him, the <br/>\n  community officer didn&#39;t and assigned him to doing various prgrams - <br/>\n  and it did scare the sh*t out of him, which is I think mostly the <br/>\n  intention - anyway, it also has resulted in his mom thinking maybe <br/>\n  she needs to be spedning more time with them, all of which is to the <br/>\n  good.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I was wondering if other people on this list have had teenagers <br/>\n  get into trouble with the &quot;law&quot; and what they have done about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  =======<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son has never gotten in trouble with the police but he did get in <br/>\n  trouble with the military police once when he was 12. We had just <br/>\n  moved to our first military base in Hawaii. We had only been there <br/>\n  for about a month. No one is allowed to have any kind of fireworks <br/>\n  on the base, not even sparklers. Somehow my son and his friends got <br/>\n  some sparklers and were playing with them on the beach. They stuck <br/>\n  them in the sand and thought they had put them all out but one of <br/>\n  them caught a little bunch of grass on fire. A woman had been <br/>\n  watching them from her window so she called in the fire and to <br/>\n  report the boys. They ran but got caught. We had to go in front of <br/>\n  the base magistrate. My son was the only one who told the truth. The <br/>\n  other boy who was there didn&#39;t say anything. The third boy moved to <br/>\n  another base before our &quot;court&quot; date so he didn&#39;t get in any <br/>\n  trouble. The magistrate gave my son and the other boy community <br/>\n  service. We were told that if he got in trouble on base again we <br/>\n  would not be able to live there. That would&#39;ve been a major hardship <br/>\n  for us because it&#39;s very expensive to live in Hawaii. We did the <br/>\n  community service, cleaning up trash on the base, which was a pain <br/>\n  in the butt for me because I had to supervise him. I was pregnant <br/>\n  and it was hot. I was a little upset because the other boy got out <br/>\n  of doing his community service because his mom worked at the base <br/>\n  thrift shop so she recorded him volunteering there although he <br/>\n  didn&#39;t actually do any work there. As far as him &quot;getting into <br/>\n  trouble&quot; it wasn&#39;t much of a big deal, just a little community <br/>\n  service. The fact that a fire had been started was a big deal and I <br/>\n  talked to my son about it. We didn&#39;t impose any other punishment. <br/>\n  The community service was enough. I think he got the message because <br/>\n  he didn&#39;t get in any more trouble on the base.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Once I actually called the police on my son. I regret it now and I <br/>\n  didn&#39;t follow through with anything. Here&#39;s what happened with that. <br/>\n  I had just had a baby. My husband had been deployed to Iraq for 6 <br/>\n  months and was going to be gone another 6 months. I bought a house <br/>\n  and closed on it when my new baby was 2 weeks old. I had to move our <br/>\n  family by myself, essentially. This, obviously, was a very busy, <br/>\n  very crazy time for me. I was not fully aware of what my son was <br/>\n  doing during that time. He was 16. While moving I didn&#39;t have <br/>\n  internet access, which is the only way I could keep track of my bank <br/>\n  accounts since my bank is in a different state. <br/>\n<br/>\n  One night I was woken up by music outside. When I went to see what <br/>\n  was going on I found some teenagers I didn&#39;t know sitting on my <br/>\n  porch drinking alcohol. My son was not there and neither was my car. <br/>\n  He did not have a license. The next morning I was checking my bank <br/>\n  accounts since I had finally gotten our internet hooked back up and <br/>\n  discovered that my son had used my atm card and taken about $600 out <br/>\n  of our savings account. When I confronted him about it he acted like <br/>\n  he couldn&#39;t be bothered and said he was going back to bed. I didn&#39;t <br/>\n  know what to do. I was so scared about where he was headed. I was <br/>\n  afraid he was on drugs. I sort of lost it. I called the police to <br/>\n  report that he had stolen my car and the money. A policewoman came <br/>\n  out and took a report but I declined to have him arrested and so the <br/>\n  whole thing was dropped. <br/>\n<br/>\n  He recently got caught where he lives now being out after curfew. <br/>\n  He&#39;s 17 and the curfew is midnight for anyone under 18. So, he has a <br/>\n  court date for that. This will be his first actual court date and <br/>\n  trouble with the law. It&#39;s probably not a big deal. He&#39;s not a bad <br/>\n  kid and he wasn&#39;t doing anything else illegal and he doesn&#39;t have a <br/>\n  record. He wasn&#39;t doing anything except waiting for his dad to pick <br/>\n  him up. He might get community service. He might just get a warning <br/>\n  or suspended sentence as long as he stays out of trouble. I&#39;m <br/>\n  planning to go to his court date just in case. Like my husband said, <br/>\n  if he gets a fine, we&#39;re the only ones who&#39;ll be able to pay it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Not sure how any of that might help you. BTW, although I considered <br/>\n  us unschoolers, I had not fully surrendered to RU until after the <br/>\n  car and money thing. That was when I finally let go of my last bit <br/>\n  of delusion that I was in control and let him completely have his <br/>\n  own life. I didn&#39;t have any trouble with him after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299478581,"authorName":"julie leonard","from":"julie leonard &lt;brihanna@...&gt;","profile":"jaysca07","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] kids doing what they want all the time","postDate":"1213061169","msgId":33692,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5NTQxLjI1NjEucW1Ad2ViODQzMTAubWFpbC5yZTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33689,"nextInTopic":33698,"prevInTime":33691,"nextInTime":33693,"topicId":33203,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**But teaching them that they can t do/have what they want simply makes them quit trying to do/get what they want.

He <br/>\nhas told me about when he stole some from the $ store and from <br/>\nCanadian tire...so I try not to freak out and try to engage him in <br/>\ndialogue about stealing which mostly ends up in me telling him why I <br/>\nthink it is wrong (basically, you are taking something that is not <br/>\nyours, it can hurt others by depriving them of their livelihood, <br/>\netc) - and the most forceful argument that his mother came up with is <br/>\nthat if any one of our teenagers gets in trouble with the &quot;law&quot;, we <br/>\nare worried that CAS might get called in - 2 single moms, 5 <br/>\nteenagers, living in a house together and unschoooling, one on <br/>\nassistance....we are hoping that that argument will sway him...so far <br/>\nhe hasn&#39;t done it again (or at least hasn&#39;t told me, but he seems to <br/>\n*want* to tell me)...but any insights people have about talking to <br/>\nkids about stealing would be great...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue that I would love comments and thoughts and previous <br/>\nexperiences with is underage drinking - same kid, thinks drinking is <br/>\nreally cool and really wants to do it, and has a bit - doesn&#39;t help <br/>\nthat he has an 18-year-old brother that also lives with us that has a <br/>\nstash....anyway, any and all input welcomed!
