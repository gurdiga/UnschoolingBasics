It&#39;s a sort of &quot;hunting cabin&quot; if you&#39;re familiar with such a thing, a pretty basic structure with few or no amenities. This one has electricity. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, George has done a lot of small-scale construction over the years and Ray had been around, and around other people building things, but never really took much interest. This was going to be Their project, a sort of guy-bonding project. In that sense, it was kind of a flop. George expected Ray to fumble around, make a lot of mistakes, ask questions, get in the way a lot, and learn from the process. Instead, Ray stood back and watched, or sat nearby and and kinda-sorta watched, or wandered off and came back. It drove George nuts - how was Ray going to learn anything when he wasn&#39;t Doing anything? <br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out Ray was watching and learning, but not in a way which made sense to George - it doesn&#39;t make sense to me, either, but this is the closest I can come. George and I (and Mo) are logical, part-to-whole learners. We learn as we go, fumbling around, figuring things out. We can learn other ways, too, but that&#39;s the way we learn complex hands-on things like... building a small structure. Or making a quilt. Or cooking. In the same sorts of situations, Ray learns backwards from the way we do. He&#39;s a more intuitive, whole-to-part learner if you will - he needs to see a whole process from start to finish, and Then he can begin to understand the parts, what they do, what they&#39;re for. He has a really hard time doing a &quot;part&quot; if he can&#39;t see how it fits into the whole - it seems like pointless &quot;busy work&quot; to him and he gets frustrated and doesn&#39;t learn as much or as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was... six years ago. He&#39;s 19 now. He has helped build small structures at local farms and communes, helped remodel a restaurant and a couple houses. He&#39;s incredibly capable. He Can do the kind of experimental learning George does, but only if he has a kind of global template in his mind first... at least that&#39;s how I think of it. But I&#39;m not an intuitive learner, so maybe it&#39;s something else and this is just as close as I can get to understanding ;) With this much understanding, George and I know not to expect the beginning of Ray&#39;s learning process to look like anything we would define as &quot;learning&quot;. It looks like a guy hanging out, doing nothing. But it works for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unmotivated kid","postDate":"1359985940","msgId":49510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDRTkyMkZFLURBMjMtNEE5Mi05NUU5LTJFMEI0NDdBMTMyNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTzZoQ0NKYlZNMlhlb3J5Ri1nelBULVpINnNha1RaV0pwZDc9azNzaXFtRU9oLWg1UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBTzZoQ0NKYlZNMlhlb3J5Ri1nelBULVpINnNha1RaV0pwZDc9azNzaXFtRU9oLWg1UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49509,"nextInTopic":49512,"prevInTime":49509,"nextInTime":49511,"topicId":49500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The sooner you accept who he is *right now* -- regardless of the cause, regardless of whether it&#39;s temporary or not -- the sooner unschooling will flow for you :-) Even if he&#39;s someone different next year, he has a whole year of being who he is right now. That&#39;s his for-now reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s unclear to you is that you *are* comparing him. You&#39;re comparing him to something he isn&#39;t.

But you can&#39;t not be frustrated with him until you pull those feelings out and examine them. Look at where they&#39;re coming from.

The problem isn&#39;t the specifics, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t have a good grasp on what learning is or how it works yet, and therefore what unschooling is or how it works. That&#39;s normal for someone new to unschooling! There&#39;s a lot to learn! But part of Your deschooling process is that right now you&#39;re seeing a problem which exists entirely in your own mind. There is no spoon ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this typical of deschooling? Yes. It&#39;s common for parents to continue to look for certain kinds of learning while deschooling and so sabotage the process to an extent - maybe sabotage it entirely. The longer you see an unmotivated kid, the longer he&#39;ll remain &quot;unmotivated&quot; because your expectations haven&#39;t changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son IS learning. He IS motivated. If you can support him in what he wants to do and learn right now, what he learns will help him heal. That&#39;s a big part of deschooling: healing from the damages of school and parental expectations. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to the rest of a kid&#39;s life to deschool, depending on how much a parent is committed to deschooling him/herself. Unschooling absolutely won&#39;t work for your son until you begin learn what natural learning really looks like. He won&#39;t start to heal until you start to change. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m running out the door, but I&#39;ll come back with some descriptions of natural learning in my own home, hopefully so you can see that your son is fine and see ways of helping and supporting him to continue learning in his own way.

A common cheat is something like &quot;invulnerability&quot; where your character never takes any damage. Another common one is &quot;maximum damage&quot; where you kill your opponents in just one or two hits. At first, I saw cheats in the schoolish sense and wondered what was the point. Then I started playing a game where I liked the story so much I didn&#39;t want to hack and bash my way through all the levels - I wanted to know what happened! So I played with the cheats on.... and realized it was like skimming a really good book the first time through - something I do all the time when I read fiction. I&#39;ll skim for the plot and then read it again for the details. Mo showed me that in a game I can Play for the plot, then play again for details. She does that a lot - play once to get the scope of the game, then play over and over to get higher scores and faster times. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you buy games, one of the points mentioned in reviews is how interesting the game is to replay. Some games change depending on the choices you make, or the levels can be played in a different sequence. Those sorts of things make a game more interesting to some players. When Ray used to play a lot of video games, he especially liked games eh could replay and get a different story. That was cool to him - it wasn&#39;t just beating levels and bosses, it was stories within stories within stories. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unmotivated kid","postDate":"1359756820","msgId":49502,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtlaGVtaytoc2ZtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyMjQ5RkJFLUUyNTMtNDhEQS1CRTdGLTMxNTRFMTRBNjE5NEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49501,"nextInTopic":49503,"prevInTime":49501,"nextInTime":49503,"topicId":49500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gina, I m going hold a couple of your comments up against each other, hopefully to help you see your son s behavior in a different light. ... *********** ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1247413507\">Gina, I&#39;m going hold a couple of your comments up against each other, hopefully to help you see your son&#39;s behavior in a different light.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &quot;lazy&quot; and unmotivated.

Don&#39;t sell your son short by ignoring the very work he&#39;s doing when he plays! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;we&#39;ve only been unschooling for a few months and probably still more in the deschooling stage<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re not seeing the value of the hours he spends gaming, then you are absolutely still deschooling, and so is he. He will deschool faster if you support him in his endeavors - if you can do that, he&#39;ll deschool faster than you will. You have years more baggage to overcome... and part of that baggage is you have very specific ideas about what kinds of activities - what kinds of learning - is valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important to value what your kids value. Not just important for unschooling, it&#39;s important to your kids. It&#39;s part of how they perceive your love for them. When you devalue what your kids love - even playing games! you devalue your own child in their eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son loves video games so much he could spend all day playing, then it&#39;s very important for you and his dad to be more involved in that. Play with him. See playing games with him as being As Important as doing something &quot;educational&quot;, as important as &quot;family time&quot;. Don&#39;t see games as a jumping off point to get him to do something you value more - see the games themselves as wonderful and important. They are to your son! <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a page on the benefits of video games - playing them:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames/\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSomething which helped me understand gaming a lot better was finding games I like. I used to think I was a book and jigsaw puzzle sort of person - but games are full of puzzles And they&#39;re stories. I was amazed, I didn&#39;t know they were stories! And I thought only puzzle games had puzzles - but they&#39;re a major component of most games. Some of the stories and puzzles are simpler than others... but that could be said of novels and word-games or jigsaws too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Another example would be the time we (well, my husband and girls) decided to start a 1000 piece puzzle. While the rest of us worked together, my son quickly decided he would rather sit on the couch and do nothing but wait<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nPoor guy, he&#39;s the odd man out and no-one cares. We have an odd-man-out in my family - my stepson, Ray. The rest of us have fairly similar interests and values, but he&#39;s the outlier. It has taken a concerted effort on my and George&#39;s part to make sure he stays included in the family - an effort to actively engage with him in the things he enjoys. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry to see the thing with the puzzle from your son&#39;s perspective - &quot;the family&quot; (but not him) decided to do a project he didn&#39;t much like and couldn&#39;t see the point of, do it right in front of him without any care for the fact that he was being left out, maybe shaming him for the fact that it wasn&#39;t something he wanted to do. That&#39;s really hard on a kid. It&#39;s crushing. It&#39;s saying &quot;your feelings are unimportant&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;wait in &quot;hopes&quot; that his dad would abandon time with his daughters in favor of time with him on video games even though my husband had already given him video game time together earlier in the day<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he needs more attention than you realize - some people need more than others! Maybe it was the whole dynamic which implied something really very cruel - implied that the love of his parents depended on his capitulation to the group. Maybe the big chaotic jumble of bits of cardboard combined with a jumble of faces and voices and opinions was too stressful. <br/>\n<br/>\nStep back from the idea that a group activity with &quot;the family&quot; is something that will meet your son&#39;s needs for attention and connection. Assume he needs some one-on-one time, more than other family members. See those as real needs, as real as if he had a serious health issue which required your attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;decided to offer him the opportunity to learn how to create video games from an online source that was designed for kids his age. He got this huge grin on his face and was so excited...until we read the description together and it said that it would ONLY require about 3-4 hours of work each week to complete the 8-week session. I noticed his countenance change <br/>\n </span></blockquote>************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou picked the wrong thing. See that change in enthusiasm as a mistake on your part, not a flaw in your child. It&#39;s okay to make mistakes, if you&#39;re willing to learn from them ;) There are game-maker programs which are more like games themselves. Does he play any SIM type games? Does he play Robolox or Minecraft? World of Warcraft? Any of those have game or animation creating aspects to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to compare two more of your statements:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;a girl and a hard-working competitive gymnast, who is highly motivated and very driven to complete a task/goal without any regard at all to the time or effort it takes to complete it. (I don&#39;t even think she notices it.)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********<br/>\n<br/>\nversus<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; &quot;lazy&quot; and unmotivated.  The type who is not interested in anything that requires any effort at all. The type who turns his back on anything where achievement takes (any amount of) time and doesn&#39;t result in instant gratification <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your daughter has no sense of effort in acheiving her goals, then she&#39;s exactly as lazy and unmotivated as your son. To her, I&#39;ll bet what she does feels like playing. In her, because you value what she does, because you can see and understand that &quot;just playing&quot; is really a lot of hard work, you don&#39;t see laziness. Learn to see your son &quot;just playing&quot; the same way. He&#39;s working and learning and growing, too. If you can value his work, his learning, his growth as much as your daughter, love and lightness and peace will expand in your family - your whole family, the one which includes your son. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unmotivated kid","postDate":"1359754191","msgId":49501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJBOEVFNEQxLThDNjktNEIxQi05N0JFLTBBMDlBQzZEREMwQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyMjQ5RkJFLUUyNTMtNDhEQS1CRTdGLTMxNTRFMTRBNjE5NEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIyMjQ5RkJFLUUyNTMtNDhEQS1CRTdGLTMxNTRFMTRBNjE5NEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49500,"nextInTopic":49502,"prevInTime":49500,"nextInTime":49502,"topicId":49500,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;d say he&#39;s interested in knowing how to create, but the process of learning how doesn&#39;t interest him yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat gets disdained, but I bet there&#39;s many things you wish you had the knowledge to do but aren&#39;t interested in the process of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to know Japanese. But the process isn&#39;t interesting to me. On the other hand I am interested in the process of crafting stories. And I&#39;ve read several books about it.

(I like jigsaw puzzles, BTW.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help enormously if you see the world through his enjoyment rather than through yours. Your judging him based on what you find worthy of time rather than honoring his own choice of what&#39;s worthy of his time. Would it feel loving for your husband to judge your worth by your lack of interest in something he loves to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be much happier if you stop comparing him to the ideal you want him to be and instead look directly at him.

I&#39;ve been here for a few weeks soaking up all the experiences and wisdom. This email is kind of in response to and related to the last set of emails that just went around by another newbie like me who was struggling with the activities that are actually taking place in a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is about a specific personality type--the type that appears (and I specifically say &#39;appears&#39; because this description is based solely on visual evidence) to be &quot;lazy&quot; and unmotivated.  The type who is not interested in anything that requires any effort at all. The type who turns his back on anything where achievement takes (any amount of) time and doesn&#39;t result in instant gratification following (very) minimal (or no) effort. The kind who you DO try and put forth creative and imaginative options that are all turned down because the perceived level of &quot;work&quot; is too great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my son, age 10, the oldest of three. Granted, we&#39;ve only been unschooling for a few months and probably still more in the deschooling stage, so it isn&#39;t the fact that his not taking initiative bothers me right now as much as his seeming lack of interest in doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, he loves video games and could play those all day every day. I&#39;m trying very hard not to let it bother me and decided to offer him the opportunity to learn how to create video games from an online source that was designed for kids his age. He got this huge grin on his face and was so excited...until we read the description together and it said that it would ONLY require about 3-4 hours of work each week to complete the 8-week session. I noticed his countenance change when we read that part and I tried explaining that 3-4 hours a week was like the time of watching one of his favorite shows each day and how that time flies by and if he was having a good time he wouldn&#39;t even notice. But in his mind it might have well have been 40 hours a week and his eager smile turned into a quick and absolute &quot;no&quot; in the blink of an eye.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example would be the time we (well, my husband and girls) decided to start a 1000 piece puzzle.

Literally, he would rather sit and do nothing at all than have to &quot;work&quot; at a puzzle that takes several days to complete (as opposed to 15 minutes), even if the minimal effort required in putting together a puzzle for an hour would have resulted in the daddy time he so desired.  (Maybe he doesn&#39;t like puzzles. I get that. That&#39;s okay. But it serves as a good example here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this typical for the deschooling stage? Is it typical for his age and gender?
