If  we had, <br/>\nwe couldn&#39;t have covered the whole thing --we would have lost lots of  money.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe family was awesome, and this is what we were able to work out. All of  my <br/>\npresenters who used written speeches for their talks happily gave him  <br/>\nprintouts he could read. The big problem was that he really wanted to be able to  <br/>\nattend the Dad&#39;s gathering. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe lucked out! One of our vendors was this awesome man who was doing a  <br/>\nFunshop on ASL and is staff at RI School for the Deaf. He offered to interpret  for <br/>\nthe Dad&#39;s group for a very reasonable cost.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard issue.

Kinda like my internal zip<br/>\nfile :::bg:::). It&#39;s also a situation where an unschool experience would<br/>\ngreatly assist the interpreter, as the nuances of the English Language are<br/>\ndifferent in our context, in ways not as obvious to those unfamiliar with a<br/>\nconceptual language like ASL.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother challenge would be overuse.
