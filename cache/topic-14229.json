It makes me think of the last place I worked <br/>\nbefore I had my son and decided to stay at home with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked in the graphics department of a huge multi-national investment bank <br/>\nand for years would see droves of the &quot;best and brightest&quot; coming in each <br/>\nfall fresh from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, etc. I watched every year <br/>\nfor 5 years as fresh-faced 22 year old &quot;kids&quot; would come in and slowly get <br/>\nbeaten down by the system that had gotten them there. They didn&#39;t know how <br/>\nto think beyond very narrow parameters, yet the employer wanted creative <br/>\nthinkers, they were afraid to stand up to their authority figures and <br/>\ndisagree or negotiate, etc., yet doing that would have helped move them <br/>\nahead in the company.  They would work 48 hours straight at times, losing <br/>\nsleep, not seeing loved ones or significant others, canceling vacations, <br/>\netc., and then I would catch some of them crying (both genders, by the way) <br/>\nin the hallways or break rooms because they were at their breaking point. <br/>\nVery few of them lasted beyond their 2 year commitment. Many of them left to <br/>\nfollow &quot;undesirable&quot; (read: low paying) pursuits such as art or dancing or <br/>\nteaching, but those who came to these decisions left floating on a cloud <br/>\nbecause they realized they were finally free of what they had been preparing <br/>\nfor all their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt times I wonder what my son will end up choosing to do for a career, but I <br/>\nwould never wish this sort of a path on him - no matter what the salary <br/>\nmight be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLesa O&#39;Daniel, AAHCC<br/>\nInstructor, Bradley Methodï¿½ of Natural Childbirth<br/>\n323-541-5515<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N\">http://www.bradleybirth.com/ndweb.asp?ID=O123&Count=N</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From: &quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Reply-To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;Subject: [unschoolingbasics] College-bound<br/>\n&gt;Date: Thu, 08 Jun 2006 19:47:49 -0000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;For anyone out there still clinging to workbooks or forced learning,<br/>\n&gt;PLEASE read this article, it&#39;s wonderful.
