Kids&#39; eating habits <br/>\nwill change in relation to growth and development, seasons, moods, <br/>\nand overall health. One of the interesting things about not placing <br/>\narbitrary limits on food is you get to see this - and your kids get <br/>\nto experience it directly. When they&#39;re little, you many have to <br/>\nobserve some of the patterns for them and point them out (or not, <br/>\nsome kids are pretty self-aware in this regard) but as they get <br/>\nolder, they become able to make decisions about what and when to eat <br/>\nbased on needs and wants, rather than &quot;shoulds&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve probably seen this already with the foods you are offering <br/>\nthem - but you&#39;re standing in the way of their &quot;play and curiosity&quot; <br/>\nby not allowing them to try things that look interesting to them. <br/>\nYou&#39;re giving them mixed messages about learning. *Some* topics are <br/>\nfine to explore to their hearts&#39; content, but not all - and you&#39;re <br/>\ndeciding which. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; T.V. At what age do you allow your children complete control over <br/>\n&gt;what they watch?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to take you back to your own premise that children learn <br/>\nby playing and following their curiosity at their own pace. It works <br/>\nwith tv, too. Just as you wouldn&#39;t leave your kids with a pile of <br/>\nmanipulatives and expect them to derive the laws of euclidian <br/>\ngeometry, you wouldn&#39;t leave your kids with the tv and expect them <br/>\nto figure it all out on their own. You can help them play and <br/>\nexplore and support their journey. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Would it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down <br/>\n&gt;and have an extensive conversation with a child? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Think about that from a different angle - would you *make* your <br/>\nchild stay in that situation? If someone is giving your kids the <br/>\nwillies, would you make them hang out with that person? Or would you <br/>\nempower your child to leave that situation? Sometimes kids want to <br/>\nexplore less-than-ideal relationships, and that&#39;s tricky, but it <br/>\n*is* possible to support their exploration in a way that leaves the <br/>\nchild feeling supported and empowered. That&#39;s much better than <br/>\nsaying &quot;no&quot; and having the child sneak off to persue the <br/>\nrelationship anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It simply makes sense to me that through play and curiosity (and I <br/>\n&gt;have two very curious ones!) they will learn far more than they <br/>\n&gt;could sitting in a classroom being forced to follow a regime that <br/>\n&gt;has nothing to do with their own hourly, daily, seasonal or you-<br/>\n&gt;name-it clock.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking about the idea that kids &quot;need consistency&quot; and I <br/>\nthink this is one way that unschooling really supports that <br/>\nparticular theory. With unschooling, though, its more a consistency <br/>\nof underlying principles, than being dogmatic about the nuts and <br/>\nbolts of daily life. If we assume kids are thoughtful people, <br/>\nthough, that kind of consistency is really the more important. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"hammy454","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Intro and Question","postDate":"1182260821","msgId":24560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1OG1vbCsyOTkwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOTgwOEUzNDg0QTYxQy0xM0M4LUQxRTRARldNLUQwNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24559,"nextInTopic":24568,"prevInTime":24559,"nextInTime":24561,"topicId":2392,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... further! ... it s ...

Okay, I have come across the comment &quot;arbitrary&quot; rules but still <br/>\nI&#39;m not<br/>\nquite comfortable. I&#39;d love to hear what some of you have to say on the<br/>\nfollowing topics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood. &lt;snip&gt; My husband and I have been eating that way since long <br/>\nbefore we had kids. My feeling is that<br/>\nmany of the ingredients in foods today are not food at all and are <br/>\nactually<br/>\nharmful. We have many chemicals allowed in our<br/>\n  &quot;foods&quot; that are already banned in other countries. Soooo if someday <br/>\nwe are in<br/>\na store and one of my children asks me to buy something with a <br/>\nmile-long list of<br/>\ningredients on it how can I not say, &quot;Sorry, honey.&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I&#39;ve been away from the computer, so I apologize for my delay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt what age, do you think, would that &quot;Sorry, honey&quot; no longer work? <br/>\nAnd do you plan to keep your children in your home, following your <br/>\nrules about food, forever?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s different when they are really little, but as soon as they start <br/>\nvisiting others withOUT your food limits, what do you think they will <br/>\ndo? Do you think they will stay away from Pringles and Oreos? Or do you <br/>\nthink they will *try* one? If they *do* try one and LIKE it...what <br/>\nthen? Will they be denied what they like? Will they be shamed about <br/>\ntheir tastes? Will they feel guilty? Will they seek these forbidden <br/>\nfoods and sneak around to get them? Will they be forced to lie to you <br/>\nto get what they want?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do *you* think will happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any more so than someone else might say their ten year-old can not try <br/>\nmarijuana. So is this considered<br/>\nan arbitrary limit?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEquating a Snickers bar with marijuana is silly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you said ten year old, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nAt what age *would* it be OK for a person to try marijuana? Eleven? <br/>\nFifteen? Thirty-two? How about that Snickers bar? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt almost 47, I&#39;ve never smoked it, by choice. But my 19 year old son <br/>\nhas. Do you think I could have stopped him? Do you think I could now? <br/>\nHow?<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the Snickers bar---how long, do you think, do you have <br/>\ncontrol over what they do/eat/smoke?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will you do when they decide thay want to do/eat/smoke something <br/>\nyou disapprove of? Forbid it? How do you think that&#39;ll work? And what <br/>\nwill be the outcome of THAT?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that foods with high sugar levels, fast foods like <br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s<br/>\nfoods etc. are actually addictive. So if your child starts in on it at <br/>\na young<br/>\nage and a parent says &quot;yes&quot; whenever they request it, they could easily <br/>\nbecome<br/>\naddicted to junk food. I do have a nephew who has never had limits on <br/>\nfood and<br/>\nthe only &quot;restaurant&quot; he will eat in is McDonald&#39;s and he does eat <br/>\nthere several<br/>\ntimes a week (yes, I will concede that the family modelling is a little <br/>\nlacking<br/>\nin this case). With obesity, ADHD, and diabetes levels where they <br/>\ncurrently are<br/>\nand are heading, isn&#39;t this somewhere that we need to do a little bit <br/>\nmore than<br/>\njust modelling?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband used to freak out that I would take Cameron (as a little <br/>\ntyke) to McDonald&#39;s almost whenever he asked. He LOVED French <br/>\nfries---and the toys! &lt;G&gt; He&#39;s now 19 and (again) a vegetarian. He only <br/>\ndrinks water. He monitors every thing that goes into his body. He eats <br/>\nvery little, if any, packaged food, and cooks up a storm. Addicted?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other son, Duncan, is now 11. I would also take him to McDonald&#39;s <br/>\nalmost whenever he asked. You couldn&#39;t MAKE him walk in the place now. <br/>\nHis favorite restaurants are Sakura, McAllister&#39;s, Hooligan&#39;s, and <br/>\nPanera. Addicted?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things we would do IS model. If one of the boys wanted <br/>\nMcD&#39;s, I&#39;d go there; but then I would go to the place *I* found more <br/>\nattractive. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get a Big Mac (although I did on <br/>\noccasion), but would opt for something better (in my opinion). If my <br/>\nson asked why, I&#39;d tell him that I didn&#39;t want McD&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what would you suggest we do differently? Forbid certain foods? It <br/>\nwon&#39;t work. Well, it WILL when the children are young, but as soon as <br/>\nthey are not under your direct supervision, they *will* try other <br/>\nthings---the forbidden things---and we all know what happens with the <br/>\nforbidden! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nT.V. At what age do you allow your children complete control over what <br/>\nthey<br/>\nwatch?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re 19 and 11---they&#39;ve always been able to watch anything. At 11, <br/>\nDuncan still prefers to watch cartoons and animal shows. He also like <br/>\nThe Most Extreme, Mythbusters, and Good Eats (we all love Alton Brown. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron (19) watches Good Eats, Family Guy, South Park, and That 70s <br/>\nShow. Nothing else (unless it&#39;s a movie that we&#39;ve all chosen to <br/>\nwatch). When he was littler, he watched cartoons---and that was about <br/>\nit---we didn&#39;t have a zillion channels like now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it, there is some pretty offensive stuff on television.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s face it, there are some pretty offensive BOOKS out there. Do you <br/>\nwant to limit books too? How would you go about that? Do you think a <br/>\nchild would choose to open Charles Dickens or Stephen King? Generally <br/>\nthey choose books with bright, colorful pages and few words.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre the unlimited television comments for teens or small children as <br/>\nwell?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey really are for both. But I&#39;ve yet to meet a small child who <br/>\n*wants* to watch anything remotely offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel half of what&#39;s on T.V. would actually terrify my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I seriously doubt that they would CHOOSE to watch something that <br/>\nwould terrify them. Would *you*? Why should we think less of our kids?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even for somewhat older kids, how often are they mature enough to <br/>\nnot be seduced by the allure of<br/>\njust how cool and how perfect half the T.V. characters are?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re worried about children&#39;s being &quot;seduced by the allure&quot; of &quot;cool <br/>\nand perfect&quot; tv characters???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down and <br/>\nhave an extensive<br/>\nconversation with a child? Is this not what we sometimes invite into <br/>\nour homes<br/>\nwhen we let a child watch anything they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty foul-mouthed---and have been accused of being sick-minded on <br/>\nmore than one occasion (of course, Deb Lewis has ME beat! &lt;G&gt;). And I <br/>\nhave extensive conversations with my kids every day! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re assuming a child would WANT that. And you&#39;re assuming that a <br/>\nchild can&#39;t see straight through it even if he does want that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a thread here a while back. Sylvia was uncomfortable with her <br/>\nsons&#39; watching Futurama and Family Guy. The language is crass. The <br/>\nsituations are sick. There&#39;s a lot a parent *could* be fearful of there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our family watches these shows. None of us behave like that. (Well, <br/>\n*I* have a potty mouth---but NOT because of those shows! &lt;G&gt;) My boys <br/>\nare gentlemen and are very polite.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk about the behaviours of the characters---and their language and <br/>\nsituations. Duncan yells at them for being so stupid! &lt;G&gt; They&#39;re <br/>\nCARTOONS! And they&#39;re supposed to be stupid!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this! I can be convinced otherwise! I <br/>\nsimply need<br/>\nto understand the reasoning here. They unschooling parents whose <br/>\nthoughts I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen reading are obviously loving, kind, thoughtful intelligent parents <br/>\nand this<br/>\nis why I am asking.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the parent of very young children, you have a LOT of control right <br/>\nnow---of food and TV and situations and ---all sorts of stuff. You <br/>\n*can* limit everything in their lives, and it seems ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as your children age, you lose control: moreso with the older child <br/>\nthan the younger (&#39;cause as the older learns new stuff, it makes it <br/>\nharder to shelter/shield the younger from the cool, new things).  When <br/>\nthey start visiting others and are able to make their own choices <br/>\nwithOUT you around, you&#39;re assuming that they will stay true to your <br/>\nbeliefs/preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they aren&#39;t you. I&#39;m guessing you probably didn&#39;t grow up with your <br/>\nbeliefs---but that you developed them by testing and research and <br/>\nquestioning and trying new things. They will need to do that too. By <br/>\nLIVING your beliefs, you will model what you hold true and dear. That <br/>\nmay not end up being your children&#39;s truths, however! They need to <br/>\nexamine and explore their own worlds and come to their own conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy limiting their worlds, you are not allowing them to make these <br/>\nscientific observations. And that&#39;s what they ARE: scientific <br/>\nexplorations and experiments. They are testing their world---seeing how <br/>\nthings fit and what works for them. They won&#39;t choose to do dangerous <br/>\nstuff. Children LIKE to be safe. But they also NEED to explore and <br/>\nfigure things out (which sometimes results in injury---BUT they&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned that, and that&#39;s extremely important!!!). Limitations don&#39;t <br/>\nallow for that important growth and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV and food limits don&#39;t allow a child to find out what he *really* <br/>\nlikes and dislikes. It allows *you* to make that decision *for* him. <br/>\nWhat he learns is that you believe that he&#39;s not capable to make these <br/>\ndecisions for himself. The belief that you ARE a capable person (and <br/>\nthat your *parents* believe that you are capable---WOW!) is so <br/>\nempowering! Children NEED that---and they deserve it!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

As you watch your two grow and learn and talk and <br/>\nwalk and breathe you realize that they are thinking, creative, people. You <br/>\nalso begin to trust them. You trust that the relationship they are creating <br/>\nwith the world around them is an informed relationship, a relationship that <br/>\nexists, not within a vacuum, but with their tastes and opinions and values. <br/>\nYou trust that because they are thinking, interesting, respected individuals <br/>\nthey will not fall prey to those things that are looking for needy, <br/>\nreactive, scared people to take advantage of. And I think it is that kind of <br/>\nrelationship, that kind of parent-child interaction that leads to radical <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that television isn&#39;t scary. I know, from absolute first hand <br/>\nexperience that my 10 year old doesn&#39;t want to see scary or sexual things. <br/>\nHe just doesn&#39;t. I know that he might change his mind someday, but right <br/>\nnow, those things are too intense and too much for him to watch, even <br/>\ncuddled up in my arms. And they don&#39;t appeal. I like watching Doctor Who, <br/>\nand usually Simon watches with me, but the last week&#39;s episode had a huge <br/>\ntense moment with people being attacked by these reverse Medusa beings who <br/>\nturn into stone when they are seen, but if you blink... Anyhow, both he and <br/>\nLinnaea (7) wanted me to change the channel, so I did. They didn&#39;t want to <br/>\nbe scared, they didn&#39;t like the tension. They got to dictate their own <br/>\nrelationship with a scary show.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that food isn&#39;t an issue. I know that because they can have any food <br/>\nthey want, and what they want is food that is varied and interesting to <br/>\nthem. Linnaea&#39;s favorite food is an Ethiopian peanut wat and she loves nori <br/>\nand when we ate at an amazing south Indian restaurant in London earlier this <br/>\nweek, she and Simon happily ate dosas and drank laasis. Simon loves bean and <br/>\ncheese burritos and this morning, when there were many and varied chips and <br/>\nchocolates and I could have easily done up some french fries or any of these <br/>\nother things, he chose to make eggy bread (British French toast without <br/>\nsyrup) which got Linnaea excited so she made some and they both enjoyed it <br/>\nimmensely. I also know that Linnaea likes chips and ice cream and chocolate <br/>\nand Simon likes bubble gum and ginger ale and bbq flavored pringles, so we <br/>\nhave those things around too. But when we went to a friend&#39;s yard for a <br/>\ncampout on Saturday to which we brought digestive biscuits (the closest <br/>\nthings to graham crackers I can find in the UK), chocolate bars and <br/>\nmarshmallows. I showed all the Brit kids how to make s&#39;mores. Many of them <br/>\ndevoured them, but my two, who have access to all kinds of foods, ate a few <br/>\nbites and handed them back. They wanted the experience but didn&#39;t need the <br/>\noverwhelming sweetness. For them food has no association with reward or <br/>\npunishment or with scarcity. And Linnaea was quite reticent to even join in <br/>\nas she doesn&#39;t eat meat and the marshmallows we can get here all have beef <br/>\ngelatine in them. She chose to take a bite, and chose not to finish the <br/>\ns&#39;more. It wasn&#39;t so tempting that she had to walk to far beyond her ethical <br/>\ndecisions. And what she eats is her choice. She&#39;s given up her favorite <br/>\nchocolate since they decided to start using rennet. That is her decision, <br/>\nnot me handing down my ethics. I&#39;m an omnivore, never been a vegetarian, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t a moral issue for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some wonderful things that have been written and collected and put <br/>\nup for others to read about food choices and television choices at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a> (about 2/3rds of the way down in the left <br/>\nhand column) and at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> oh, and if you want to read <br/>\nsomething about how limiting access to something can make it that much more <br/>\nvaluable read Pam&#39;s response here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html\">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html</a> . I&#39;m sure there are others. This <br/>\nis sort of the core set of questions when people come to thinking about <br/>\nunschooling, it is often the largest boogeyman in a parent&#39;s perspective on <br/>\nthe dangers of raising a child. But really, television isn&#39;t scary, it can <br/>\nopen up so much of the world and lead to the most amazing questions.

Okay, I have come across the comment &quot;arbitrary&quot; rules <br/>\n&gt; but still I&#39;m not quite comfortable. I&#39;d love to hear what some of you <br/>\n&gt; have to say on the following topics.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Food. As I mentioned my children are 2 and 5. I never tell them how much <br/>\n&gt; to eat or that they have to eat. I put a little of everything we&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; serving on their plate and they eat what they feel like from the plate. My <br/>\n&gt; oldest boy has not eaten fish (knowingly) for at least a year. But it is <br/>\n&gt; on his plate if that is what we have cooked - he doesn&#39;t have to eat it. <br/>\n&gt; There are always a few other things on the plate too. He did the same <br/>\n&gt; thing with red meat for about a year. And with no pride lost or anything <br/>\n&gt; else, since no comment was ever made about his choice to leave it, he <br/>\n&gt; started eating it again recently. But we don&#39;t have junk or processed food <br/>\n&gt; in the house, in fact we hardly have any packaged food in the house. We <br/>\n&gt; pretty well eat organic whole foods and that&#39;s it. My husband and I have <br/>\n&gt; been eating that way since long before we had kids. My feeling is that <br/>\n&gt; many of the ingredients in foods today are not food at all and are <br/>\n&gt; actually harmful. We have many chemicals allowed in our<br/>\n&gt; &quot;foods&quot; that are already banned in other countries. Soooo if someday we <br/>\n&gt; are in a store and one of my children asks me to buy something with a <br/>\n&gt; mile-long list of ingredients on it how can I not say, &quot;Sorry, honey.&quot;? <br/>\n&gt; Any more so than someone else might say their ten year-old can not try <br/>\n&gt; marijuana.

Are the unlimited television comments for teens or small children as well? I feel half of what&#39;s on T.V. would actually terrify my kids. And even for somewhat older kids, how often are they mature enough to not be seduced by the allure of just how cool and how perfect half the T.V. characters are? Would it be okay to let a foul-mouthed, sick minded person sit down and have an extensive conversation with a child? Is this not what we sometimes invite into our homes when we let a child watch anything they want?<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear thoughts on this! I can be convinced otherwise! I simply need to understand the reasoning here. They unschooling parents whose thoughts I&#39;ve been reading are obviously loving, kind, thoughtful intelligent parents and this is why I am asking.<br/>\n <br/>\nWarm regards,<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      Get news delivered with the All new Yahoo!

I mention all this<br/>\nbecause I strongly suspect that you are separating educational activities<br/>\nfrom life, and thinking in terms of school subjects and some on paper method<br/>\nof proving that your dd has learnt some skill - outside of living it. A<br/>\njourney towards Unschooling means letting go of these limiting definitions. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;We&#39;ve been through vision therapy, so the <br/>\nphysical issues she had that made reading and writing difficult are<br/>\nresolved, but she still <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like those activities. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to force whatever these activities are on her in even a gentle way<br/>\nshows her that you have an agenda for her learning timetable. Worse, it<br/>\ncontinues to reinforce that she has some kind of lack in your eyes. You are<br/>\ndefining her in terms of her difficulties by seeking to address them<br/>\nspecifically.<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;My biggest concern with a less structured approach to <br/>\nhomeschooling is that she&#39;ll never learn to read or spell.

All<br/>\nthey do all day is learn what they *need* for the activities that interest<br/>\nthem, sometimes asking for assistance. I think you are mixing up what *they<br/>\nreally, genuinely, individually need* with what school (the dominant<br/>\nideology) tells you they need - often spurious. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling helps my family live mindfully in the present, without worrying<br/>\nabout future *needs*. Two days ago Jayn (4.75) wrote her name for the first<br/>\ntime to sign a piece of artwork. Tonight she suddenly recited our phone<br/>\nnumber - I didn&#39;t know she had ever heard it. She is interested in being<br/>\nable to label her work, and she is also very interested in telephones.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/deschooling<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above is a link to Deschooling for Parents.
