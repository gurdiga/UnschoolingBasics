I have one son who wants to learn martial arts and open his own dojo - no diploma or degree required. I have another who wants to build the first flying car - depending on how he chooses to pursue that, he may need to go to college and pursue an engineering degree. Of course, my dojo son could pursue a degree if he chooses, regardless of his career; and my flying car son could choose not to pursue a degree and gain the knowledge that he&#39;ll need in a different way. The point is that a HS diploma is not, for the most part, a requirement for a job or for college these days. I think most people pursue diploma and degree as a matter of course, in the hopes that they may eventually be able to turn their education into some sort of career; in our home, we hope our children will find their passions and then decide whether or not<br/>\n college will help them achieve their dream.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 5/8/09, Connie Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie.k.johnson@...\">connie.k.johnson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Connie Johnson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:connie.k.johnson@...\">connie.k.johnson@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] high school degrees?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Friday, May 8, 2009, 5:52 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\nHello, just a question for anyone regards to high school degrees?
