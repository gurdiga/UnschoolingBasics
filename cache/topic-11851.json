Just so you&#39;re not  <br/>\nreading waiting for the bad part.<br/>\nWe went to the capital at 8am for a signature of a proclamation (a  <br/>\nroyal one! the girls giggled) officially declaring the month of April  <br/>\nthe state autism awareness month. It was amazing because the autism  <br/>\ngroups in Oklahoma were working hard for a while to get this done.  <br/>\nNot only was it cool to be recognized for a work.<br/>\nThe kids enjoyed it too, and were really dismayed to see how little  <br/>\nattention the representatives paid to the work being done! Josh noted  <br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t really watch or applaud until the author presented  <br/>\nus. Ah, the creation of a cynic. The girls were irritated that many  <br/>\nof them didn&#39;t even get on the floor until a quorum call. ;-)<br/>\nAfter that we headed to the zoo. Spent half an  hour at the park, an  <br/>\nhour watching gorillas, and an hour watching the tortoises. No  <br/>\nstress...and after that we headed to the omniplex. Come home cram  <br/>\ndown dinner, and go to church.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, that usually these kinds of days the kids love, but I  <br/>\nalways ruin in by stressing out, wanting to do it all. All these past  <br/>\nfew months of practice really paid off. I was able to go with the  <br/>\nflow, I had fun too, instead of worrying about seeing this or that.  <br/>\nNow I&#39;m tired. Too much for this old lady. :-) I stayed up late to  <br/>\ntry and print out some cool autism awareness stickers. Did it too,  <br/>\nand they were cute, and the kids loved them. I dont&#39; know if this  <br/>\nmakes any sense...too tired, gotta go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11854,"nextTopicId":11861}}
