See if he can come up with or decide upon a solution (or a combination) including any of the ideas from this list to see if any appeal? You could have a long term and short term plan. Whatever would give him back control of his body, but ensure safety too. I could imagine that meeting his Grandparents in a special place away from their home might be a very fun short term solution, as previously suggested on this list. And it could fill in maybe while finding an alternative treatment for a longer term solution. That&#39;s just a thought. You could (together) map out six or seven special places maybe..?<br/>\nThe long term solution could be anything too - making the inhaler more friendly & less scary - finding an alternative treatment - finding a way for your son to be willing to use it if necessary. The details are your son&#39;s, but I think the important thing in this idea I am presenting is to give him back the reins.<br/>\nAlso, I second the homeopathy as far as treating a pet allergy, even one as extreme as asthma. Btw, I think diet can also be a factor - I&#39;ve heard about dairy being linked to allergic reactions (but that&#39;s of course a whole new can of worms). (Acupuncture is I believe very helpful too and I think accupressure - but again these may be future options as I&#39;m not sure of the feasibility of a four year old choosing to endure either.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the homeopathy it seems would be a really helpful route here since it is effective and non-invasive.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck - please excuse brevity -<br/>\nWith love,<br/>\nCornelia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: asthma","postDate":"1303182114","msgId":46540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlvaXR2Mis3M2ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5MDA4MC43ODI1NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTE3MTgubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46539,"nextInTopic":46541,"prevInTime":46539,"nextInTime":46541,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s not about you or me or Grandpa or the cat.

It has been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t my right to insist on it.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re fortunate that our son is rarely sick and has never needed meds prior to this. We&#39;ve occasionally tried to give him stuff before, like Benadryl when he got hives from a dog licking him. He resisted so we didn&#39;t push it because it wasn&#39;t necessary. The difference here is that it&#39;s hard for me to figure out when the wheezing is going to progress into a more serious situation (it doesn&#39;t always, sometimes will just clear up with time after we leave the allergen). When is it really necessary?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What we had been doing is listen to his lungs, measure his levels with an oximeter, and hold off on treatment unless the numbers really dropped. However, what we&#39;ve been told multiple times now is that if we give treatment early, they won&#39;t drop at all. Basically, it stops the attack in it&#39;s tracks and may make further treatment unnecessary.  But I really don&#39;t want to go through this traumatic process if it&#39;s not going to progress! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; exhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>\n&gt; &gt; distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; His symptoms have been typical allergy symptoms that progress to breathing difficulties. Eyes get itchy, nose starts to run, coughing starts. His oxygen stats drop and you can hear the wheezing, squeaking sound in his lungs develop and get worse. It&#39;s never gotten to the point of extreme breathing difficulty.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s rarely bothered by anything as long as things are going his way, and has been this way since an infant. His attacks aren&#39;t severe, but when the sat scores get down in the low 90s, this concerns me. My understanding is that it&#39;s bad for the brain and other organs once you get below 92 or so.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have had several doctors, as well as other parents, tell me that some kids will act fine until they just collapse. This possibility scares me. I don&#39;t like making decisions based on fear, but have a hard time being OK with letting his symptoms progress past a certain point now due to this. It seems irresponsible. However, it also feels totally wrong to me to force treatment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing difficulties.  I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an effective dose?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That is part of it, but it&#39;s also just how his body reacts. The first time he was ever treated (last fall) at a quick care center, they gave him a treatment and waited. His sat scores didn&#39;t improve right away so they gave him another, still not working, so they sent us to the ER. By the time we got there and in (about 30 mins later), he had recovered to 99%! They acted like we were silly for bringing him in and couldn&#39;t even hear anything wrong with his lungs, when just prior they had sounded atrocious. The doctors told us that for some people, it can take 30 mins for it to take effect. We know it does work though, as you can hear the audible wheezing go away. It&#39;s just not immediate so I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s making the connection, or maybe he just doesn&#39;t feel the trade off is worth it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yes, he continues normal life when he&#39;s having an attack, even when his sats drop to low 90s. If it gets really bad, he&#39;ll settle down his activity level, perhaps ask to lay down, and ask for water. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the  attack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with administering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you use the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just was never comfortable with them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve let him play with the spacer part, even let him blow a few puffs on the inhaler into the air. He&#39;s fine with it, up until it comes time to actually administer it. I know he says it tastes bad, and DH remembers from asthma treatment as a child that he always thought that too.  If it were just a quick shot and done he might be better with it. With the spacer, you have to keep it on for several breaths. He really hates things touch his face without being in control, so that likely makes it worse. The doctors suggested it because you don&#39;t have to take the deep breath to inhale it all at once, can just take regular breaths which is meant to be easier for little kids. Will have to investigate the possibility of just giving it directly to someone uncooperative, what that would mean and how we might do it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that an option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been hesitant to introduce daily meds for something that is only of concern every once in a while. The systemic affects, cost, etc. just seem an unacceptable trade off. Plus we would also have to consider that give his resistance to any kind of treatment it might turn into a struggle there too.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Have you looked into the GAPS diet at all to heal the asthma?... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No, again because it&#39;s been infrequent. That seems extreme given how often this has been of concern, and that it is largely controllable through avoidance. Perhaps I need to reconsider this given our son&#39;s more frequent requests to visit.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Since he had the initial attack in late September, it&#39;s been an issue perhaps 10-20 times, and maybe 5 times have things progressed to the point we&#39;ve had to give the treatment. Only twice has it been bad enough we&#39;ve had to give more than one dose. If we can avoid pets, we just do not need it at all. Nothing but dogs and cats seem to trigger it.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":452754049,"authorName":"melissa maranda","from":"melissa maranda &lt;love.gratitude@...&gt;","profile":"marandamelissa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] asthma","postDate":"1303158493","msgId":46543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEyMS1XNDA3M0E4MDNFNzVGOEZGMEQzOTQzQ0Y0OTEwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5N0REOUQzQ0MzOTQ1RUE5NzVFNjUyOEI3RTNFMjlEQHVscmlrZT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlvZ2c5aSs1MjI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDc0NjkxLjE3MDYxLnFtQHdlYjg2MjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQxODE5Ny4xNzkyOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+LDw0OTdERDlEM0NDMzk0NUVBOTc1RTY1MjhCN0UzRTI5REB1bHJpa2U+"},"prevInTopic":46542,"nextInTopic":46544,"prevInTime":46542,"nextInTime":46544,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ulrike~ I am not the orignal poster but I find your suggestions very helpful.

But I read and heard a lot around it.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) It was often suggested that dehydration is very influential in causing asmathic<br/>\nattacks. So getting hydrated with &#39;good&#39; water seems to be very helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Then I heard and experienced myself that people get major relief using EFT in<br/>\nallergic situations (or TAT or other energy psychology technics). Find a reliable EFT<br/>\npractitioner near you or on the WWW who uses Skype or some other chat mode (or telephone<br/>\nsessions) and do a session with them. I could stand in, too, though my timing is a little<br/>\nbit obscure living in Namibia.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) If you live near a nuclear power plant (100 mile radius is good enough) I would<br/>\nsuggest that you do everything to get yourself and your loved ones cleared of radiation as<br/>\nsoon as possible. This seems to be a major contributor to many issues we experience all<br/>\nover the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Forcing medication that is prescribed by the energetically illiterate medical<br/>\nsociety seems to be a great issue with unschoolers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that following my grandchildren&#39;s wishes about &#39;how they want to treat their<br/>\nmaladies&#39; works best every time. They KNOW! They know what they need and what their body<br/>\nneeds. Listen to your child!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe all of this sounds &#39;out there&#39; but I personally think that unschooling is enough out<br/>\nthere to varant alternative ways to look at things and to handle situations in an<br/>\nunconventional way, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a situation where friends of my friend&#39;s daughters visited our home, filled with<br/>\ncats, and they were getting into panic mode within minutes. We &#39;tapped&#39; (using EFT) and<br/>\nthey could cuddle the nearest cat with ZERO symptoms within 10 minutes. I find it so<br/>\nunsettling that so many people go to so many lengths - washing cats, dusting and vacuuming<br/>\netc - when the CAUSE is not looked at. EFT provides one way to look at the cause (which<br/>\ncould be emotional) and neutralise its effects. And if radiation is the cause (not only<br/>\nthe Fukushima stuff floating around but from the bomb tests in 1963 and more recently and<br/>\nchemtrails and haarp) then there are quite a number of ways to get our DNA up to scratch<br/>\nagain, too. google it - it is out there. and it could be child friendly, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\n<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 6053<br/>\n(20110418) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 6053<br/>\n(20110418) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":442033011,"authorName":"Gwen Montoya","from":"Gwen Montoya &lt;lifeisjustthis@...&gt;","profile":"willow_selene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] asthma","postDate":"1303155004","msgId":46536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGlrWkJFWHhEU2pzM3k2dmVGY1gzRVZUNWVpZXBRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvZ2c5aSs1MjI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZ2c5aSs1MjI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46535,"nextInTopic":46537,"prevInTime":46535,"nextInTime":46537,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my youngest (now 4.5) was about 18 months old we moved from New Mexico to Oregon.

She went from not having asthma to having asthma & needing daily<br/>\nmedications. She was hospitalized 2x within 5 months of our arrival and it<br/>\nwas traumatic for all of us. She still goes to the ER at least 2x a year and<br/>\nwe deal with asthma flare-ups every other month or so. She has a rescue<br/>\ninhaler with a spacer and she also needs a daily inhaled steroid.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to give a nebulizer to a kid who doesn&#39;t want one is so hard! It is<br/>\nloud and annoying, so I really tried to save it as a last resort. The rescue<br/>\ninhaler works faster anyway. I used to do &quot;blow-bys&quot; (hold the mask above<br/>\nher face while she sleeps or direct the nozzle at her) on Zoe when she was<br/>\nyounger and sleeping. It only worked when she was sleeping deeply, but<br/>\neffective. She used to hate the nebulizer, but we used headphones, cartoons,<br/>\nspecial toys...I&#39;ve even fed her M&M&#39;s through the mask while she uses it.<br/>\nThere were times when she was younger when she&#39;d only take a little bit of<br/>\nthe nebulizer and we&#39;d come back to it several times during the day. Having<br/>\nher say funny things while she&#39;s using the nebulizer was helpful too. &quot;Luke,<br/>\nI am your father.&quot; sounds pretty funny through a mask. We used to sing<br/>\nsongs, do puzzles...anything to &quot;normalize&quot; the nebulizer.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s added stickers to her spacer and we let her play with an extra one<br/>\nwhenever she wants. Having autonomy over when she uses it has been really<br/>\nhelpful. Obviously, there are times when it just has to be used - in those<br/>\ninstances, I&#39;ll say something like &quot;let&#39;s use your inhaler and then go do<br/>\nthis cool thing&quot;. But if at all possible, I let her decide if she needs it.<br/>\nI&#39;m also trying to share as much information with her as possible, so I<br/>\nmight say something like &quot;it sounds like you are wheezing(or coughing or<br/>\nshort of breath), if you use your inhaler you might breathe easier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing - I know how scary the wheezing can sound. When they were<br/>\nlittle, I&#39;d stay up all night watching them (both of my kids have asthma and<br/>\nthey usually have flare-ups at the same time) breathe and listening to the<br/>\nwheeze. We bought a home oxygen sensor that measures the percent of oxygen<br/>\nin your blood...it goes on your finger, takes seconds to read and doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhurt. I think it cost about $80. Having that visual information about how<br/>\nshe&#39;s breathing has been a huge relief to me. Our doctor wants us to bring<br/>\nher into the ER if her O2 sats get to 93 or lower. But she can sound wheezy<br/>\nat 98 (which is a normal oxygen level).<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Apr 17, 2011 at 9:56 PM, iris777888 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iris777888@...\">iris777888@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment.

Unfortunately, this is not at option. Grandpa is very attached to the cat, and I truly believe it would affect his mental well being if we were to request","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1509661547\">Thanks for the replies everyone. To answer a few questions in particular, and also help me think through this more:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If your son is having problems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would consider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but worth thinking about.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, this is not at option. Grandpa is very attached to the cat, and I truly believe it would affect his mental well being if we were to request they give it up. It would also be a cause of friction between the two grandparents. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment.  It has been quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t feel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t my right to insist on it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;re fortunate that our son is rarely sick and has never needed meds prior to this. We&#39;ve occasionally tried to give him stuff before, like Benadryl when he got hives from a dog licking him. He resisted so we didn&#39;t push it because it wasn&#39;t necessary. The difference here is that it&#39;s hard for me to figure out when the wheezing is going to progress into a more serious situation (it doesn&#39;t always, sometimes will just clear up with time after we leave the allergen). When is it really necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we had been doing is listen to his lungs, measure his levels with an oximeter, and hold off on treatment unless the numbers really dropped. However, what we&#39;ve been told multiple times now is that if we give treatment early, they won&#39;t drop at all. Basically, it stops the attack in it&#39;s tracks and may make further treatment unnecessary.  But I really don&#39;t want to go through this traumatic process if it&#39;s not going to progress! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>\n&gt; exhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>\n&gt; difficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>\n&gt; distressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>His symptoms have been typical allergy symptoms that progress to breathing difficulties. Eyes get itchy, nose starts to run, coughing starts. His oxygen stats drop and you can hear the wheezing, squeaking sound in his lungs develop and get worse. It&#39;s never gotten to the point of extreme breathing difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s rarely bothered by anything as long as things are going his way, and has been this way since an infant. His attacks aren&#39;t severe, but when the sat scores get down in the low 90s, this concerns me. My understanding is that it&#39;s bad for the brain and other organs once you get below 92 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had several doctors, as well as other parents, tell me that some kids will act fine until they just collapse. This possibility scares me. I don&#39;t like making decisions based on fear, but have a hard time being OK with letting his symptoms progress past a certain point now due to this. It seems irresponsible. However, it also feels totally wrong to me to force treatment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing difficulties.  I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an effective dose?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is part of it, but it&#39;s also just how his body reacts. The first time he was ever treated (last fall) at a quick care center, they gave him a treatment and waited. His sat scores didn&#39;t improve right away so they gave him another, still not working, so they sent us to the ER. By the time we got there and in (about 30 mins later), he had recovered to 99%! They acted like we were silly for bringing him in and couldn&#39;t even hear anything wrong with his lungs, when just prior they had sounded atrocious. The doctors told us that for some people, it can take 30 mins for it to take effect. We know it does work though, as you can hear the audible wheezing go away. It&#39;s just not immediate so I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s making the connection, or maybe he just doesn&#39;t feel the trade off is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? That doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, he continues normal life when he&#39;s having an attack, even when his sats drop to low 90s. If it gets really bad, he&#39;ll settle down his activity level, perhaps ask to lay down, and ask for water. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; Another possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced when he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the  attack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with administering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you use the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, and have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just was never comfortable with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve let him play with the spacer part, even let him blow a few puffs on the inhaler into the air. He&#39;s fine with it, up until it comes time to actually administer it. I know he says it tastes bad, and DH remembers from asthma treatment as a child that he always thought that too.  If it were just a quick shot and done he might be better with it. With the spacer, you have to keep it on for several breaths. He really hates things touch his face without being in control, so that likely makes it worse. The doctors suggested it because you don&#39;t have to take the deep breath to inhale it all at once, can just take regular breaths which is meant to be easier for little kids. Will have to investigate the possibility of just giving it directly to someone uncooperative, what that would mean and how we might do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Another option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I know there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that an option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in an attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have been hesitant to introduce daily meds for something that is only of concern every once in a while. The systemic affects, cost, etc. just seem an unacceptable trade off. Plus we would also have to consider that give his resistance to any kind of treatment it might turn into a struggle there too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Have you looked into the GAPS diet at all to heal the asthma?... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, again because it&#39;s been infrequent. That seems extreme given how often this has been of concern, and that it is largely controllable through avoidance. Perhaps I need to reconsider this given our son&#39;s more frequent requests to visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince he had the initial attack in late September, it&#39;s been an issue perhaps 10-20 times, and maybe 5 times have things progressed to the point we&#39;ve had to give the treatment. Only twice has it been bad enough we&#39;ve had to give more than one dose. If we can avoid pets, we just do not need it at all. Nothing but dogs and cats seem to trigger it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46477013,"authorName":"Ulrike Haupt","from":"&quot;Ulrike Haupt&quot; &lt;rica@...&gt;","profile":"ulrikehaupt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] asthma","postDate":"1303148152","msgId":46531,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5N0REOUQzQ0MzOTQ1RUE5NzVFNjUyOEI3RTNFMjlEQHVscmlrZT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxODE5Ny4xNzkyOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlvZ2c5aSs1MjI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDc0NjkxLjE3MDYxLnFtQHdlYjg2MjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDQxODE5Ny4xNzkyOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46530,"nextInTopic":46532,"prevInTime":46530,"nextInTime":46532,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok Dears, Dearest Dears I don t have personal experience of asthma.

But I read and heard a lot around it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n1)     It was often suggested that dehydration is very influential in causing asmathic<br/>\nattacks. So getting hydrated with &#39;good&#39; water seems to be very helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n2)     Then I heard and experienced myself that people get major relief using EFT in<br/>\nallergic situations (or TAT or other energy psychology technics). Find a reliable EFT<br/>\npractitioner near you or on the WWW who uses Skype or some other chat mode (or telephone<br/>\nsessions)  and do a session with them. I could stand in, too, though my timing is a little<br/>\nbit obscure living in Namibia.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)     If you live near a nuclear power plant  (100 mile radius is good enough) I would<br/>\nsuggest that you do everything to get yourself and your loved ones cleared of radiation as<br/>\nsoon as possible. This seems to be a major contributor to many issues we experience all<br/>\nover the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n4)     Forcing medication that is prescribed by the energetically illiterate medical<br/>\nsociety seems to be a great issue with unschoolers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that following my grandchildren&#39;s wishes about &#39;how they want to treat their<br/>\nmaladies&#39; works best every time. They KNOW! They know what they need and what their body<br/>\nneeds. Listen to your child!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe all of this sounds &#39;out there&#39; but I personally think that unschooling is enough out<br/>\nthere to varant alternative ways to look at things and to handle situations in an<br/>\nunconventional way, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a situation where friends of my friend&#39;s daughters visited our home, filled with<br/>\ncats, and they were getting into panic mode within minutes. We &#39;tapped&#39; (using EFT) and<br/>\nthey could cuddle the nearest cat with ZERO symptoms within 10 minutes. I find it so<br/>\nunsettling that so many people go to so many lengths - washing cats, dusting and vacuuming<br/>\netc - when the CAUSE is not looked at. EFT provides one way to look at the cause (which<br/>\ncould be emotional) and neutralise its effects. And if radiation is the cause (not only<br/>\nthe Fukushima stuff floating around but from the bomb tests in 1963 and more recently and<br/>\nchemtrails and haarp) then there are quite a number of ways to get our DNA up to scratch<br/>\nagain, too.  google it - it is out there. and it could be child friendly, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\n<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 6053<br/>\n(20110418) __________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 6053<br/>\n(20110418) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] asthma","postDate":"1303144212","msgId":46527,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxODE5Ny4xNzkyOS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3NDY5MS4xNzA2MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGlvZ2c5aSs1MjI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDc0NjkxLjE3MDYxLnFtQHdlYjg2MjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46526,"nextInTopic":46528,"prevInTime":46526,"nextInTime":46528,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have asthma  and sometimes I choose to not use the inhaler  for a little difficulty breathing and it goes away.

Since then, we&#39;ve gotten rid of our <br/>\n&gt;&gt; cats and and have eliminated all prolonged contact with pets other than <br/>\n&gt;&gt; at his grandparent&#39;s house. He absolutely LOVES to visit and has a very <br/>\n&gt;&gt; close and special relationship with grandma. The grandparents have a cat. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; We used to go there weekly, let him spend the night a few times, and now <br/>\n&gt;&gt; we can barely stay a couple hours before his body starts to react-- and <br/>\n&gt;&gt; that&#39;s even after grandma does a marathon cleaning session, furnace <br/>\n&gt;&gt; filter change, open windows, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH is allergic to cats. No amount of cleaning the house will help him, <br/>\nif his parents (who own a cat) even bring over a book or a set of keys that <br/>\nhave been in the house with the cat, he still reacts. If your son is having <br/>\nproblems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would <br/>\nconsider giving up their cat? Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but <br/>\nworth thinking about. My mother has chosen not to keep her cat (well, <br/>\nactually, it was my sisters, but she has been looking after it for a few <br/>\nyears), so that my DH feels comfortable visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possible option is to go on a vacation with the grandparents? <br/>\nPerhaps stay overnight at a hotel or something could be exciting, and a <br/>\npossible substitute for staying at the grandparents.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment. From the get go, he <br/>\n&gt;&gt; has fought the inhaler/spacer. The few times we&#39;ve had to administer it, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; DH and I have struggled to do it even with us both working together to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; hold him down. At the time we felt it was either that, or else face an ER <br/>\n&gt;&gt; visit where they&#39;d do similar as he was getting progressively worse. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve since gotten a nebulizer, thinking he&#39;d prefer that, but no such <br/>\n&gt;&gt; luck. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment. It has <br/>\nbeen quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nmy right to insist on it. I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>\nexhibiting? Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>\ndifficulties. What signs of this are there? Is your son visibly <br/>\ndistressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the <br/>\nattack.

I just <br/>\nwas never comfortable with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.

It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in <br/>\nan attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve tried explaining, but that does not work for a multitude of reasons. <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve tried to make it less scary for him- got special masks for the <br/>\n&gt; nebulizer, let him wear headphones to cover up the noise it makes, etc. He <br/>\n&gt; still wants nothing to do with it. Unfortunately, either form of the <br/>\n&gt; treatment takes 15-30 mins to kick in, so he doesn&#39;t recognize that it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; the source of his relief. He also does not yet understand the nature of <br/>\n&gt; the allergy, why it happens to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get an almost instant relief from my inhaller when I&#39;m having breathing <br/>\ndifficulties. I wonder if because he&#39;s fighting it, he isn&#39;t getting an <br/>\neffective dose?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The only thing that has worked is giving the inhaler to him while he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; sleeping. However we now know that the severity and duration of the attack <br/>\n&gt; is less the quicker he gets the treatment. Not always feasible to wait for <br/>\n&gt; sleep if the attack happens at a non-sleepy time<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he is able to go to sleep while having an attack, even occasionally? <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t sound like it needs treatment to me? What sort of a reaction <br/>\nis he getting? I&#39;m asking, because my daughter was &#39;diagnosed&#39; as asthmatic <br/>\nat around 9 months by a doctor, because her chest recesses when breathing. <br/>\nLuckily I wasn&#39;t convinced, and we consulted a paedatrician, who disagreed <br/>\nwith the diagnosis. My daughter is now 6.5, and has never shown any <br/>\nconvincing signs of asthma, though her chest still does recess when <br/>\nbreathing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"teeth wasRe: [unschoolingbasics] asthma","postDate":"1303137782","msgId":46525,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlvaGlsbSsyNHI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDMyNDQ2OC4xNTE5Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46524,"nextInTopic":46526,"prevInTime":46524,"nextInTime":46526,"topicId":46515,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Back many years ago now, I rescued a stray cat (it was huddled on a friend&#39;s car engine trying to stay warm as the car was off at the time). She had critters of various sorts which required daily bathing with anti-critter shampoo. Granted, she was a wee kitty at the time which made it easier. But, once the nasty critters were gone, I continued to bath her once a week (even though she was totally an indoor cat). Friends of mine who were/are cat allergic had a much easier time of it visiting if I kept up with the cat washing, so I did. She wasn&#39;t all that happy with it but habit had taught her that (a) sitting still and tolerating it got things done faster (b) she&#39;d get a treat afterward (c) she could &#39;take revenge&#39; by sitting her damp self on my pillow :- ) She got weekly baths until we had to give her away (to the ILs) because of our housing situation; she was about 8 at the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I set up an advent calendar sort of thing where every time <br/>\nhe took his dose for the day he would get a toy from the advent calendar. It <br/>\nadded a moment of pleasure to something that he needed to do. Maybe you could <br/>\nhave a bunch of things that you know your son would like wrapped up as presents <br/>\nat his grandparents so that if he needs the nebulizer you can give him the <br/>\npresent as a straight bribe for using it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom has asthma and has a breathing exercise/toy sort of thing with a ball in <br/>\nit where she blows into an inhaler like opening and the ball rises on her breath <br/>\n(it may have been a respiratory exerciser, it may have just been a peak flow <br/>\nmeter). Maybe you could get something like that for your son to play with when <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t having an asthma attack so that he could acclimate to the experience <br/>\nmore. I imagine that in the middle of an attack he&#39;s fairly stressed out and <br/>\nthat it is much harder for him to be calm in the face of more things that he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like. If the equipment and the treatment is something that seems more a <br/>\npart of everyday things it may be easier for him to use the nebulizer or <br/>\ninhaler. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my imaginings my best case scenario of forcing my little 4 year old Simon to <br/>\nuse an asthma inhaler would have me saying calmly &quot;You need this medication to <br/>\nhelp you to breathe,&quot; forcing him to use it and then moving on to something <br/>\nelse. If Simon was resistant to the use of something that he needed to breathe I <br/>\nwould give it anyhow. In the moments when he didn&#39;t need it I would look for <br/>\nthings to make it easier for him to trust me on this one as well as preparing <br/>\nhim for it&#39;s later use. Play with blowing bubbles or blowing up balloons, maybe <br/>\ntake a baby bugs yoga class where they do calming, breathing techniques, talk <br/>\nabout breathing to calm down, deep breath in, slow breath out. And talk about <br/>\nwhy he has the allergies at grandma&#39;s and grandpa&#39;s house. Talk about the kitty <br/>\nand how her skin and hair sometimes makes it hard for him to breathe and that <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s having trouble breathing you need to make it easier for him with the <br/>\nnebulizer. Ask him what would make it easier for him to use it. See if you and <br/>\nhe could put cool stickers on it or a funny set of lips or paint it or use <br/>\nSharpies to decorate it. Make it more playful and less threatening. Talk about <br/>\ngoing and getting a treat when he&#39;s used the nebulizer or inhaler when he needed <br/>\nit. Go get ice cream afterwards or a toy or anything, use the wrapped presents I <br/>\nsuggested. Do anything you can to make it as pleasant as possible without <br/>\ngetting too stressed out when he needs it. And if he won&#39;t use it, move through <br/>\nthe point of forcing him as quickly and as unemotionally as possible, and then <br/>\ngo and get the treat or the present or the whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and with the peak flow meter, if you have the wherewithal, you can show him <br/>\nhow the nebulizer worked. Have him check his peak flow before using the <br/>\nnebulizer and then take it afterwards. Talk about the experiment as you do it, <br/>\nif he&#39;s interested. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: iris777888 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iris777888@...\">iris777888@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like a violation of his bodily autonomy to hold him down.

No amount of cleaning the house will help him, <br/>\nif his parents (who own a cat) even bring over a book or a set of keys that <br/>\nhave been in the house with the cat, he still reacts.  If your son is having <br/>\nproblems, is it possible for you to ask the grandparents if they would <br/>\nconsider giving up their cat?  Not sure if that&#39;s an option or not, but <br/>\nworth thinking about.  My mother has chosen not to keep her cat (well, <br/>\nactually, it was my sisters, but she has been looking after it for a few <br/>\nyears), so that my DH feels comfortable visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possible option is to go on a vacation with the grandparents? <br/>\nPerhaps stay overnight at a hotel or something could be exciting, and a <br/>\npossible substitute for staying at the grandparents.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; DS is very, very, very averse to asthma treatment. From the get go, he <br/>\n&gt;&gt; has fought the inhaler/spacer. The few times we&#39;ve had to administer it, <br/>\n&gt;&gt; DH and I have struggled to do it even with us both working together to <br/>\n&gt;&gt; hold him down. At the time we felt it was either that, or else face an ER <br/>\n&gt;&gt; visit where they&#39;d do similar as he was getting progressively worse. <br/>\n&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve since gotten a nebulizer, thinking he&#39;d prefer that, but no such <br/>\n&gt;&gt; luck. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My DD is also very averse to any kind of treatment for any ailment.  It has <br/>\nbeen quite stressful for me until I realised that if the situation didn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel badly enough for her to want to take something for it, then it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nmy right to insist on it.  I&#39;m not sure what symptoms your son is <br/>\nexhibiting?  Since you&#39;ve mentioned asthma, I&#39;d assume breathing <br/>\ndifficulties.  What signs of this are there?  Is your son visibly <br/>\ndistressed, or is he not bothered by it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility is that if the inhaller/spacer is only being introduced <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s having an asthma attack, then he might associate it with the <br/>\nattack.  Can you let him play with it at other times?  Play with <br/>\nadministering it to his toys?  Is it the mask he&#39;s objecting to?  Can you <br/>\nuse the inhaller without the spacer?  I&#39;ve been an asthmatic all my life, <br/>\nand have never used a spacer, even though I know they&#39;re recomended.  I just <br/>\nwas never comfortable with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is some of the non-invastive asthma/allergy treatments.  I <br/>\nknow there is a tablet form that is given to kids here in Australia, is that <br/>\nan option?  It would have to be taken more regularly, and isn&#39;t helpful in <br/>\nan attack, but it still might be an option to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve tried explaining, but that does not work for a multitude of reasons. <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve tried to make it less scary for him- got special masks for the <br/>\n&gt; nebulizer, let him wear headphones to cover up the noise it makes, etc. He <br/>\n&gt; still wants nothing to do with it.
