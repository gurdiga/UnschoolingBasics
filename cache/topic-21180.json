Danielle loves to eat<br/>\ncherry tomatoes and green beans right out of the garden. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad and his brother owned a commercial greenhouse when I was little and I <br/>\nused to sneak into the tomato house and hide under the benches and snarf <br/>\ntomatoes.   I had those tiny, paper Morton salt shakers strategically <br/>\nstashed for easy access.   Ah, sun warmed tomato!<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan used to like to help me in the garden when he was little.  He <br/>\nespecially liked looking for Daddy Longlegs in the green beans.  He&#39;d pick <br/>\nthem up and sometimes they&#39;d get away from him and he&#39;d come up to me and <br/>\nsay, &quot;Mom, I have a longlegs problem,&quot; and I&#39;d get the silly thing off his <br/>\nhead and put it in his hand again. &lt;g&gt;  I have a picture of him crouching in <br/>\nthe beans looking for Long Legs.    You can hardly tell there&#39;s a kid in <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Oh, and I&#39;ll<br/>\nnever forget her excitement when she found her first tomato hornworm a<br/>\nfew years back! (they ARE kinda cute!)***<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, they are cute. &lt;g&gt;  We like garden critters.  Even the ones no one <br/>\nelse likes.   But a Montana garden is fleeting thing anyway.  When the <br/>\ngrowing season is only about three months long and I can count on at least <br/>\none hard frost during each of those months, it doesn&#39;t pay to fret over <br/>\nwhoever or whatever finds my little patch. &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a small garden but I <br/>\nstill manage to grow enough to share. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan and I had great fun in the garden.  We used to grow pole beans on <br/>\nmakeshift teepee frames and he&#39;d have little bean forts to play in.   We <br/>\nbuilt spider web frames for orb weaving spiders and put them around the <br/>\ngarden and checked every day to see who&#39;d taken up residence.   Dylan would <br/>\nhelp me dig potatoes with his Tonka backhoe and then he&#39;d haul them in the <br/>\ndump truck over to the tarp under the tree. &lt;g&gt;   We always had pretty <br/>\ngardens because he liked to put flowers in the garden rows and paths.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\nHe still likes to garden.  He still likes to pick up any longlegs he comes <br/>\nacross.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: Where carrots come from","postDate":"1170515498","msgId":21180,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjIwMWM3NDdhNSQ5YTk1YzEzMCRmYzY4OTA0NUBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21181,"prevInTime":21179,"nextInTime":21181,"topicId":21180,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***there is danger of confusing it with any of several poisonous plants, *** It s true the flowers look similar and the first year leaves can look similar but","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1192701132\">***there is danger of confusing it with any of<br/>\nseveral poisonous plants, ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s true the flowers look similar and the first year leaves can look <br/>\nsimilar but the tubers are<br/>\ndifferent and the smell is very different and in the second year the mature <br/>\nplants are quite different in appearance and not so easy to confuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe root of the wild carrot smells very carroty. Unmistakable.  The Water <br/>\nHemlock root looks different, has no carrot smell and when cut open is <br/>\nsegmented with hollow chambers.   The whole plant of the water hemlock <br/>\nsmells something like a muskrat. &lt;g&gt;   Both are members of the Parsley <br/>\nfamily.<br/>\nAnd I think I might rather eat the Hemlock than have another of those <br/>\nterrible bitter carrots. &lt;g&gt;  Water Hemlock is the more common Hemlock in <br/>\nthe rocky Mountains, so I know that one pretty well.   Wild carrot isn&#39;t <br/>\ncommon in Montana.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other edible and inedible family members with similar flowers. <br/>\nThe root of the<br/>\nYampa is a little carrot like in flavor and sweet.  MUCH better tasting than <br/>\nthe wild carrot.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21155,"nextTopicId":21182}}
