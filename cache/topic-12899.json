Before I came home with my three children I was a<br/>\nrecreation therapist for 15 years and what I know is that people do not give<br/>\nmuch credit to what they don&#39;t know or to the everyday things or leisure<br/>\nactivites they do for learning purposes.  It is when those things are taken<br/>\naway that they see the value.  Instead of giving family or others answers<br/>\nabout what our children are learning I often ask them what they learned from<br/>\nthe same actiivity. I know that my children learn conflict resoluiton from<br/>\nplay from picking teams or sharing on the playground.  I also believe that<br/>\nthe people questioning me are doing so that I am able to see the positives<br/>\nof uncschoioling and help me remeber why I do what I do for my children <br/>\neven when I doubt are they learning enough.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nTywane\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThe way for a person to rise is to improve themselves every way they can,<br/>\nnever suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder them.  - Abraham Lincoln -\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n----- Original Message ----\r<br/>\nFrom: Momma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:southernbelle@...\">southernbelle@...</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>\r<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 9, 2006 9:53:19 AM\r<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Need help please\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nIf family is being rude about it I would guess that no answer you give them\r<br/>\nis going to be satisfactory.

I don&#39;t have to be nasty but I can be firm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a VERY positive unschooling moment today.  Zachary *wanted* to<br/>\ndo the PRE-GED (couple weeks ago) and he was doing damn good learning<br/>\non his own, if he had a question he asked.  That proves that he is<br/>\nself motivated and capable of learning things at &quot;higher levels&quot;.  A<br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t need 12 years of an education to prepare for an SAT<br/>\nshould Zak want to go college...he only *needs* prep study guides and<br/>\nprep tests..that is it.  He has a love of higher maths, say he just<br/>\nsolely looks at math/physics for the next several years, he can CLEP<br/>\nout of having to take math in college.  If he wants it bad enough<br/>\nhe&#39;ll do it.  Everyday, both of my children learn something, that<br/>\nPROVES that they are capable of learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI WILL MISS ALL OF YOU!!!

Before I came home with my three children I was a recreation therapist for 15 years and what I know is that people do not give much credit to what they don&#39;t know or to the everyday things or leisure activites they do for learning purposes.  It is when those things are taken away that they see the value.  Instead of giving family or others answers about what our children are learning I often ask them what they learned from the same actiivity. I know that my children learn conflict resoluiton from play from picking teams or sharing on the playground.  I also believe that the people questioning me are doing so that I am able to see the positives of uncschoioling and help me remeber why I do what I do for my children  even when I doubt are they learning enough.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTywane <br/>\n <br/>\nThe way for a person to rise is to improve themselves every way they can, never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder them.  - Abraham Lincoln -<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Momma &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:southernbelle@...\">southernbelle@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, May 9, 2006 9:53:19 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Need help please<br/>\n<br/>\nIf family is being rude about it I would guess that no answer you give them<br/>\nis going to be satisfactory.

He is learning about<br/>\nangles, measurements, layout, design, safety, putting in a hard day&#39;s work,<br/>\ngaining pride in a job well done, satisfying a curiousity, further<br/>\ndeveloping his relationship with his father!  OMG if all our children could<br/>\nhave that opportunity!<br/>\n<br/>\nDan periodically takes Emily to work with him (he&#39;s a computer network<br/>\nengineer and programmer.)  Seems like everytime he does he manages to find a<br/>\nway to put her to work. Something blows up or they get an emergency where<br/>\nthey need 100 laptops out the door for adjustors so he has her configuring<br/>\nthe laptops and doing inventory checks.  When he first started doing this he<br/>\nwas questioned all the time.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t she be at home studying or<br/>\nsomething?&quot;  Now they love it when she comes in because she knows what she<br/>\nis doing, can be trusted with a task, and can actually communicate problems<br/>\nand suggest solutions to resolve them.
