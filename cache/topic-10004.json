I <br/>\nreally believe that if you think he&#39;d just sit or lie around, <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of healing that needs to happen and you need to shift <br/>\nhow you see your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is to help people get to unschooling. Yes, I will tell <br/>\npeople that a happy home with some school is much better than an <br/>\nunhappy one without school, but at the same time, this list is to <br/>\ngive unschooling advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I would tell you to STOP schooling him. To trust him fully and <br/>\nto not look at his interests as future career material. He&#39;s a kid <br/>\nstill!! He doesn&#39;t need to think about his future. He needs to live <br/>\nin today.<br/>\nPassions and interests DO build wonderful futures, but not by trying <br/>\nto figure out how to turn an interest into a career until that time <br/>\ncomes. He&#39;s young. He needs to play video games because he loves <br/>\nthem, that&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like the video games are only valid if he is thinking <br/>\nabout a career plan. No, they&#39;re valid because it makes him happy. <br/>\nIf he never has anything to do with technology or gaming in the <br/>\nfuture, it is valid because he loves it TODAY. He&#39;s learning more <br/>\nfrom that than all the contrived schoolwork, but you&#39;re still <br/>\ntrusting the schoolwork more.<br/>\n<br/>\nA joyful, passionate life is tough to find when you are required to <br/>\ndo things you don&#39;t care for. He still can, but it&#39;s just harder. In <br/>\norder to truly support his interests, they need to be enough. They <br/>\naren&#39;t a side thing, or a distraction from more important things, <br/>\nthey ARE the important things. Get into his world, see what he loves <br/>\nabout them. Ask him a few questions and try to play with him if <br/>\npossible. His future belongs to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10002,"nextTopicId":10008}}
