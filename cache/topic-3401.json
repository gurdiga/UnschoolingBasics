You don&#39;t need to agree <br/>\nwith all of their more Christian slanted beliefs in order to feel <br/>\nwelcome though. <br/>\nI&#39;m not a Christian, but I love many of the Christian hymns I grew <br/>\nup with, so I attend Unity some. Most of the talks aren&#39;t about <br/>\nanything in the Bible, it&#39;s more about self improvement (which I&#39;m <br/>\nsure varies from church to church).<br/>\nIt&#39;s a very positive environment, supportive of all who wish to <br/>\nexplore their spirituality and open to all belief systems. If you <br/>\nprefer something with a less Christian slant though, Unitarian is <br/>\nbetter. I do sometimes get annoyed with that part, because it isn&#39;t <br/>\na reflection of where I am...but I take the parts I love and leave <br/>\nthe rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually like both for different reasons. Unity is very into self <br/>\nhealing and more spiritually oriented, Unitarian seems more <br/>\nintellectually oriented (at least the one here). Both are very <br/>\npositive places to learn different things...I&#39;ve attended both, but <br/>\nUnity is where I&#39;ve been going off and on. I think I&#39;d go to the <br/>\nUnitarian church more, but it&#39;s a much longer drive.:)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3398,"nextTopicId":3409}}
