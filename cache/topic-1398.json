We could have forced<br/>\nhim to give up the things he was finished with but then we wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\nhad so many cool things to pass along to my brother&#39;s daughter. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan recently donated something like seventy books to our library. <br/>\nTheir place on his shelves is slowly being filled with Calvin and Hobbes<br/>\nand Edward Gorey collections. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nHe used to have a huge pile of stuffed animals on his futon and each<br/>\nnight he would select one to sleep with.  He would talk to it and wrap it<br/>\nin his little baby quilt and his little baby afghan and call it his<br/>\nbundle of snuggles.  He said he knew they weren&#39;t really alive but just<br/>\nin case they could understand him somehow he wanted them to know he&#39;d<br/>\nalways love them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few weeks ago he was up in his room for awhile and when I went up<br/>\nlater he&#39;d put them all away in bins into the storage area under the<br/>\neaves.   He&#39;s growing up and doesn&#39;t need his bundle of snuggles anymore.<br/>\n I can&#39;t tell you how I felt.  I had this flash that in the next minute<br/>\nhe&#39;d be leaving home and out in the world on his own.  Honestly, if I<br/>\ncould have one more night to look at that pile of critters or to<br/>\nlistening to him talk sweetly to a little stuffed dinosaur I&#39;d take it.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think acquiring a lot of stuff as a child is materialism.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think kids understand what materialism means, and are not making<br/>\nsocial or political decisions when they find something they&#39;d like to<br/>\ntake home with them.  I think they&#39;re exploring and learning and<br/>\nexperimenting.   If you could look at it that way maybe it would ease you<br/>\na little? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were of the school mind set and your kids were really interested<br/>\nin the latest &quot;educational&quot; toys and gizmos, you&#39;d probably be thrilled<br/>\nand feel quite pleased if you could provide them with those things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an unschooler you come to have this awareness that every little thing<br/>\nyour kids have exposure to will contribute to their store of knowledge<br/>\nand their understanding of the world.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, but I think, it&#39;s more likely for a person who feels<br/>\ndeprived to grow up to be materialistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother consideration is we can&#39;t know what will really be important to<br/>\nour kids.  We can live a principled life and share it as best we can with<br/>\nour kids as a natural part of being together but we can&#39;t decide what<br/>\nwill be best for them.  They will make that decision .  If we&#39;re trying<br/>\nto live a more natural lifestyle we can explain why we walk or ride our<br/>\nbikes to the store instead of driving.  We can talk about why we chose an<br/>\nelectric car vs. gas.  We can talk about why we don&#39;t use chemical<br/>\nfertilizers or pesticides.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we make choices for our kids, like not buying toys, etc., because<br/>\nof our ideals and those choices leave our children feeling resentful and<br/>\ndeprived, we won&#39;t be sharing the things we really hope to share with<br/>\nthem.   I believe a life style that leaves our kids feeling like they&#39;re<br/>\nmissing something won&#39;t be embraced by them as they grow older and are<br/>\nout on their own.  I think they might even resent it for a long time and<br/>\nthose feelings of resentment might lead them to overlook the very best<br/>\nparts of a philosophy we as parents hoped to passed on to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not to say I think parents need to buy every toy a child<br/>\nexpresses interest in.  Natural limitations are real.  We don&#39;t always<br/>\nhave the money.  We don&#39;t always feel like we can spend the money we do<br/>\nhave on something that can wait until the next payday.  We don&#39;t always<br/>\nhave room, or a way to get it home.  I think children understand natural<br/>\nlimitations, or can if we give them a chance to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t need a cuisinart or a blender or a microwave or furniture or<br/>\nelectricity or running water or a flush potty or gas heat or a car or a<br/>\npair of Birkenstocks, but I have those things.   I *could* live without<br/>\nthem.  My decision to have those things for the convenience they provide<br/>\nme has probably impacted the world in bigger ways than the toys my son<br/>\nhas had over the years.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I think if we can be the best example of our principals and<br/>\nideals to our kids, and if we can provide the happiest, most respectful,<br/>\nkid friendly home possible, we have a greater probability of passing on<br/>\nto our children those things we feel are important.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] materialism","postDate":"1089134010","msgId":1460,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDhiLmVmZDMwMGUuMmUxYjU4ZTFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":1453,"nextInTopic":1463,"prevInTime":1459,"nextInTime":1461,"topicId":1398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-92586739\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m thinking about polly pockets, for instance, which if you know about<br/>\nthem, <br/>\nare made in lots of different &#39;sets&#39;.

My kids have never been forced to get rid of anything, <br/>\ntheir stuff was always in their control. But because dh and I are <br/>\nalways sacking items up, hauling them to Goodwill and looking around <br/>\nat the thrift stores, my kids automatically join in.<br/>\nNot every time. I simply let them know I&#39;m taking some stuff in, and <br/>\nas if they have anything to add to the pile. Sometimes they&#39;ll throw <br/>\nitems in, sometimes not. But it&#39;s just a part of life around here, <br/>\nso they&#39;ve picked up on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe often look around at various thrift/bargain stores, I think they <br/>\nfeel if they want something we&#39;re going to help them get it, so no <br/>\nneediness associated with &quot;stuff&quot;.<br/>\nThey&#39;ve had their own weekly spending money for a while, and that&#39;s <br/>\nprobably helped them be judicious consumers more than anything. <br/>\nI help them buy whatever they want if it&#39;s truly in my budget. Other <br/>\ntimes I can&#39;t, and it&#39;s nice for them to have their own money to <br/>\nspend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talk a lot about items they want....imagine what it would be like <br/>\nto own it etc... I think just honoring their feelings sometimes <br/>\ntakes the neediness out of the situation. If they feel their <br/>\npossessions are truly theirs, they will be able to release them when <br/>\nthey are good and ready. Some people just like more <br/>\nstuff than others, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. He&#39;ll probably <br/>\nhave an easier time being choosy with what he keeps, as he matures. <br/>\nI know my oldest didn&#39;t like getting rid of anything at a young age, <br/>\nbut he&#39;s almost a minimalist <br/>\nnow!
