Here is some clarification as well as some <br/>\nother information which may be helpful in working out any issues. If <br/>\nwhat I give you doesn&#39;t work, send me an e-mail directly at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) Price for rooms/suites is per room regardless of the types of <br/>\npeople in the room (ie, adults, children, or combination of the two). <br/>\nFor the person who posted last week that she heard from Central <br/>\nReservations otherwise, I&#39;m glad to report that was inaccurate:) I <br/>\nconfirmed that today with the Sales Manager whom I negotiated with when <br/>\nwe agreed upon the hotel. Price per room is $89 + tax; $109 + tax per <br/>\nsuite;<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) To make reservations by phone, call the hotel&#39;s direct line at <br/>\n(505) 843-6300. While this number is on the L&L Website along with the <br/>\n800 #, it goes directly to the hotel reservation personnel. These folks <br/>\nknow more about the conference than their Central Reservations <br/>\npersonnel (RE: those at the 800 #) since this number goes to an <br/>\noff-property location in Canada. I have asked the Sales Manager to <br/>\nblock some rooms with Central Reservations in case you still are <br/>\nswitched to Central Reservations if you call either the 505 or 800 #s. <br/>\nOne hint: if you call the direct number, hang up and try again if not <br/>\nanswered on the 5th ring. That is the magic number for a switch over to <br/>\nCentral Reservations; and,<br/>\n<br/>\n  3) You can also make reservations via e-mail. Send your name, the <br/>\nnumber of nights that you plan to stay, the dates of your stay, your <br/>\ncredit card information with expiration date, and the type of room (ie, <br/>\nsingle King, double, or suite) to Brenda Parra at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bparra@...\">bparra@...</a>. <br/>\nMs. Parra should send you a confirmation after a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ben Lovejoy<br/>\n Hotel Coordinator,<br/>\n Live and Learn Conference</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13438,"nextTopicId":13539}}
