We frequent the library quite often, one of <br/>\n&gt;several <br/>\n&gt; actually.  Our only problems arise, usually, when one of my crew <br/>\n&gt;needs <br/>\n&gt; the bathroom.  Hauling myself and four kids into the bathroom, <br/>\n&gt;away from <br/>\n&gt; the computer games they were playing or books they were looking <br/>\n&gt;at, <br/>\n&gt; usually results in trouble.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>As was mentioned, is there a bathroom handy that a child can get to <br/>\non his/her own? Our library, too, has a nice roomy &quot;family style&quot; <br/>\nbathroom right in the children&#39;s room (the children&#39;s section is the <br/>\nwhole downstairs - the library itself is an old historic home that <br/>\nwas expanded onto, the children&#39;s section would have been the <br/>\nbasement. What&#39;s cool is that the old &#39;sitting room&#39; area, bay <br/>\nwindows, fireplace, and all is where they have the mystery <br/>\ncollection, you can sit in the &quot;parlor&quot; and read mysteries set <br/>\nin &quot;the parlor&quot;...) In this kind of set up, a 5 yr old (or older) <br/>\ncould readily manage the situation on her own. Also, maybe avoid the <br/>\nwhole situation by limiting the library visiting time for now - make <br/>\nsure everyone gets fed and &quot;watered&quot; far enough in advance that you <br/>\ncan make a potty break before leaving the house, then only stay an <br/>\nhour or so (however long it is on average before they&#39;d need to go <br/>\nagain) and do a family potty break on the way out before leaving the <br/>\nlibrary for the trip home. That way, it isn&#39;t breaking into the <br/>\nmiddle of whatever they are doing - that has already been wound down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Today, my 2 1/2 year old dd was making a <br/>\n&gt; noise, over and over again which seemed to reverberate louder and <br/>\n&gt;louder <br/>\n&gt; in the room (because she likes the echo) <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would definitely signal me to get right there with her and say <br/>\nsomething like &quot;Wow the echoes are really cool. Know what? I think <br/>\nwe should find someplace where we can really check out lots of <br/>\nechoes...I know a spot (at some other okay to make noise place, at <br/>\nhome, wherever) that would be really good. Let&#39;s give (big sister) a <br/>\ncouple minutes to finish up with (whatever) and we can go there. For <br/>\nthe next couple minutes though, let&#39;s try to cut down the echoes. <br/>\nFolks in libraries generally want it a little quiet while they are <br/>\nthinking and reading.&quot; (BTW at our library, because the children&#39;s <br/>\nsection is totally separate from the adult section, the volume tends <br/>\nto be a little more normal speaking voice rather than hushed. They <br/>\neven have toys that ring bells and make other noises there. Yelling <br/>\nis out but talking is okay).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and my 5 year old dd (who loves <br/>\n&gt; to play the part of a parent correcting the younger one) was <br/>\n&gt;saying <br/>\n&gt; &quot;stop it&quot; over and over and louder and louder to where she <br/>\n&gt;inevitably <br/>\n&gt; begins to cry.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a not in the moment thing. Separate and apart from the <br/>\nevent, maybe talk with her about this type of situation. I&#39;m <br/>\nguessing that she has heard &quot;you&#39;re a good helper with little <br/>\nsis&quot; &quot;can you help Mommy with ... to take care of little sis&quot; and so <br/>\non. Makes sense, then, that she is going to &quot;take care&quot; of things if <br/>\nit seems that it is needed. So, maybe talk with her (outside of the <br/>\nsituation) about how when you&#39;re at places like the library, you&#39;ll <br/>\ntake care of little sis so she can go do whatever it is she wants to <br/>\ndo. She doesn&#39;t have to feel responsible to manage her sibling(s). <br/>\nIn the moment, I might get right next to her, look in her face and <br/>\nsay &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll take care of it. Why don&#39;t you go look at the fish <br/>\ntank...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  How do you take the time, breath, and ask yourself <br/>\n&gt; how to respond to this when the behavior at the moment is like an <br/>\n&gt;out of <br/>\n&gt; control geyser?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>First, nip it in the bud (I know, that phrase gets so abused, but it <br/>\nfits). Rather than wait for the volume to escalate to the point they <br/>\ncan&#39;t hear, catch it quickly. Next, ignore &quot;everybody&quot; as <br/>\nin &quot;everybody is watching me&quot; and focus on your kids and their <br/>\nneeds/situation. Third, figure out ahead of time how you&#39;ll handle <br/>\nit. It&#39;s kind of similar to the way they teach defensive driving - <br/>\nyou don&#39;t wait until your car is in a skid or blows a tire or <br/>\nwhatever to figure out what to do. You mentally rehearse it ahead of <br/>\ntime so that when it does happen, you don&#39;t have to &quot;think it <br/>\nthrough&quot; right then, you can just respond. Fourth, having 4 kids <br/>\nwith at different developmental stages and with different levels of <br/>\ninterest in library things and differing abilities to handle that <br/>\nenvironment for long stretches, it might behoove you to indeed make <br/>\nseparate library days for different kids. Maybe children 1 & 3 <br/>\nreally love the computers there and could spend a long time, while <br/>\nchildren 2 & 4 can handle maybe half an hour of browsing and picking <br/>\nbooks and that&#39;s it. Trying to manage the two sets all at once means <br/>\nthat no one (especially you) ends up happy - two get their time cut <br/>\nshort OR two have to linger when they want to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] you guessed it - another question from me","postDate":"1154694564","msgId":16246,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODg1RDhDMTM1NTE0NC05MjQtNTUxQG1ibGstZDMwLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0RDJCQ0JBLjYwNjAzMDNAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ0RDJCQ0JBLjYwNjAzMDNAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":16245,"nextInTopic":16252,"prevInTime":16245,"nextInTime":16247,"topicId":16241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Are they old enough that you could easily leave them<br/>\nmomentarily to take another to the bathroom?  I miss &quot;my library&quot; in a city<br/>\nI used to live in.  There was a set of bathrooms right in the children&#39;s<br/>\narea.  Whoever planned the children&#39;s area (with their low shelves, small<br/>\ncomputer desks, plenty of room, lounging pillows and ledges and a bathroom<br/>\nright there) is a genius!  Do you go at times where your kids either are<br/>\ninteracting with other kids or are the only ones there?<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my 2 1/2 year old dd was making a<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; noise, over and over again which seemed to reverberate louder and louder<br/>\n&gt; in the room (because she likes the echo) and my 5 year old dd (who loves<br/>\n&gt; to play the part of a parent correcting the younger one) was saying<br/>\n&gt; &quot;stop it&quot; over and over and louder and louder to where she inevitably<br/>\n&gt; begins to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could you have physically separated them?  One key is that I would look for<br/>\nways to circumvent this kind of situation from happening.  What is it that<br/>\ntriggers this scenario and how can you work to keep that from happening?<br/>\nCould you wonder the stacks with your younger child or engage her in a book<br/>\nor puzzle or other activity?  Could you possibly take your older chldren to<br/>\nthe library at a time when you can leave the younger ones at home?  I know<br/>\nthat before we got our beautiful aforementioned library, that library day<br/>\nwas a huge boredom day for Keon.  He had no interest in lounging at the<br/>\nlibrary and reading books.  He would go in, grab a Donald Crews book (we<br/>\nread them all - several times) and was ready to leave.  Not what the girls<br/>\nwanted to do.  They wanted to spend time browsing, reading, talking to the<br/>\nlibrarians, playing on the computers, etc.  So I got to a point where I<br/>\nwould take them after their dad got home or on the weekends &quot;the guys&quot; would<br/>\nhead to the model train store and we would head to the library.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink NOW about ways that you could better have handled the situation.  How<br/>\nyou could have prevented the situation to begin with.  It also might help to<br/>\nexplain to your 5yo that she doesn&#39;t need to parent your toddler and that<br/>\nyou can do that, but for her to tell you when her sister is bothering her<br/>\nand ask for your help in giving her the peaceful surroundings that she is<br/>\ndesiring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":268622920,"authorName":"Amy Mason","from":"Amy Mason &lt;doodlemakers@...&gt;","profile":"doodlemakers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"you guessed it - another question from me","postDate":"1154661562","msgId":16241,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0RDJCQ0JBLjYwNjAzMDNAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16242,"prevInTime":16240,"nextInTime":16242,"topicId":16241,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please don t kick me off this list for asking too many questions but I am desperately seeking advice from you seasoned pros that hopefully I will become one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1489565802\">Please don&#39;t kick me off this list for asking too many questions but I <br/>\nam desperately seeking advice from you seasoned pros that hopefully I <br/>\nwill become one day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need advice on how I should have better responded to a situation that <br/>\noccurred today.
