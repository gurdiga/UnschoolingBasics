Chico was holding the wounds while she <br/>\nlay on the floor and another child called 911. LeaAnn had run to the <br/>\nstore and came home to her husband holding her child&#39;s massively <br/>\nbloody arms and ambulances on the way to her house!<br/>\n34 stitches and a cast later, they let her come home for the night <br/>\nto sleep, then back up  to the hospital this morning where they put <br/>\nher under for tendon surgery.<br/>\nAfter all this trauma, it looks like she&#39;s going to heal just fine <br/>\nand have full use of her hands and wrists. Just a big &#39;ol scar on <br/>\none side. Ouch! Poor kid.<br/>\nSo they&#39;re home now and resting, but I thought some of you might <br/>\nlike to say hi and &quot;get well Tori&quot; or something. <br/>\nLeaAnn and Chico are quiet members, always reading but not posting <br/>\nmuch. They&#39;ve been here, at UD and Always Learning for a long time, <br/>\nthey&#39;re also my cohorts with our local homeschool group.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thought some of you would want to know. <br/>\nSome of the folks here know them in real life, and I figured this is <br/>\nthe fastest way to tell everyone.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2102,"nextTopicId":2112}}
