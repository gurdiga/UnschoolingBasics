We&#39;ve only <br/>\nbegun homeschooling a couple months ago and I think you folks make <br/>\nsome good points.  Some of it really makes sense, and I try to <br/>\nincorporate it in our lives.  Since we&#39;ve only just begun <br/>\nhomeschooling who knows where we&#39;ll end up?<br/>\nAt any rate, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t surprise any of you that we&#39;ve <br/>\nreceived some flack for pulling our child out of school (the younger <br/>\ntwo are too young to officially &quot;school&quot;). <br/>\nI went on your blog and took exception to some of the comments <br/>\nthere, not just the idea that homeschooling/unschooling is <br/>\nneglectful/abusive, but to the very idea that it is treason.<br/>\nDespite our best efforts to encourage and shield our son, the public <br/>\nschool system systematically broke down his self-worth, self-<br/>\nconfidence, respect for those in a position of authority, and love <br/>\nof learning.  We finally decided the only way we could protect him <br/>\nfrom teachers who were teaching incorrect material, telling him they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have time to answer his questions, and disciplining him for <br/>\nOUR conduct was to remove him from their grimy little hands in the <br/>\nfirst place. (We have teachers in our family and I have respect for <br/>\nthe profession but not those particular individuals or a system that <br/>\nallows/encourages/confines them to act in such a manner.)<br/>\nAnyway, I WOULD have been neglectful if I had allowed my child to <br/>\ncontinue being emotionally abused by the system.  In the couple of <br/>\nshort months we&#39;ve been homeschooling, we&#39;ve already started to see <br/>\nhim blossoming back into the amazing, intuitive, enthusiastic <br/>\nlearner he used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing our son learned being in public school and  <br/>\npulled out of ps is that those in authority not only aren&#39;t always <br/>\ncorrect, but in this country at least, you not only have the right <br/>\nto question authority, but the duty as a good citizen to <br/>\nrespectfully not &quot;shut-up and take it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nLong live Patrick Henry.
