That&#39;s a good measure of whether you&#39;re doing enough. If they&#39;re struggling to fill the hours, then yes, offer more, suggest more.

I&#39;ve been very drawn to the idea of Unschooling, child lead learning etc. I haven&#39;t yet read John Holts writings (plan to), but I&#39;ve read a lot from Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, and other online groups . I first began the whole process with much worry and anxiety (mostly due to outside pressure from family and my partner, his father). I was making up math work sheets, and little projects here and there. I have now stopped making him do these things, and I do see that he has many interests, (mountains of the world, weather logs, land formations, there&#39;s more). He undoubtedly is learning, but I&#39;m having trouble understanding how to proceed. How do I successfully &quot;unschool&quot;? There are still days when I feel a trip to the library, a hike, bike riding, and video games somehow is not enough. Perhaps it&#39;s the pressure from his father, who keeps saying things like, &quot;He needs to be in school&quot;, that is causing my doubts to surface periodically. Any input would be most appreciated. I guess I feel that it&#39;s a somewhat abstract idea (unschooling).

If all a kid has to play with is sticks and stones, they&#39;ll find a way to be engaged with sticks and stones. For a child to be choosing activities that are meaningful to what they&#39;re curious about, the environment needs to be full of rich opportunities that they might enjoy. (Not just stuff adults think they should be interested in! One time a mom groused that the kids were playing video games instead of the educational kits and books stored on the shelves.) Even more it needs you to be doing interesting things and drawing them in. (That mom wasn&#39;t doing the kits. She wasn&#39;t making cookies. She was expecting the kids to get interested and plunge in all on their own.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kids are then choosing princess play over other things then that means it&#39;s exactly what they need. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re playing around with the ideas of how people interact with each other. Which is more complex and rocket science! :-) They&#39;re exploring the elements of storytelling and human relationships, both of which adults can end up spending a lifetime learning about and still never be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but a little harder for me to leave my background behind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Adults generally need way more deschooling than kids. Adults have been on the planet hearing about how necessary school is far longer than kids. And as a teacher you&#39;ve been immersed in that way of thinking since you were 5 or 6 until now. A good rule of thumb is it takes 1 month for each year in school. And those years count as student or teacher!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We use the library a lot and do lots of reading<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Books are only a tiny portion of ways to learn about the world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/bookworship\">http://sandradodd.com/bookworship</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to express this in a way that doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;Books aren&#39;t important.&quot; Obviously books are wonderful :-) So do keep visiting the library. Do keep reading to them if they enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut books have been elevated so high that people tend to dismiss other ways of learning as though they had only minor importance. People focus their idea of what &quot;best learning&quot; looks like on what books do best: present facts in words.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now that we can hold the internet in our hands, and get the facts as fast as our thumbs can type, what schools actually teach -- the stuff that teachers can test -- is practically irrelevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the world needs is people who can experience life and ask questions. People who can try things out and learn from what they try.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words: Play :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll ways of learning are important. Would you want to take horseback riding lessons from someone who&#39;d only read books about horses? Or eat at a restaurant with a chef who&#39;d only read about cooking food?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome ways of learning are more important for learning some things. Some are more important to some people because they learn better in ways other than books.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since schools rely so heavily on books -- because it&#39;s as close as 1 teacher can manage to get 30 students learning the same thing at the same time -- people tend to think books are the ultimate way to learn. Books were the ultimate bridge to the world and the past when humans often didn&#39;t move far from home in their entire lives. But now the world comes to us and we can go to the world in all sorts of rich ways and books pale in that in comparison. The internet. Movies. TV. Video games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing, smelling, tasting, feeling, hearing. Unless a book has (static) pictures, they offer none of those. See books for what they do best. But embrace other ways of learning. Since your kids aren&#39;t tied to desks, make sure they have the opportunities -- if they want to explore them -- to engage all their senses, and explore the ways *they* find most meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might help:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy You Can&#39;t Let Go<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New to Unschooling","postDate":"1358089114","msgId":49377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtjdWkycSs0c2Y0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49376,"nextInTopic":49378,"prevInTime":49376,"nextInTime":49378,"topicId":35908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **************** YES!

One of the hardest thing for former teachers, sometimes, is remembering that - it&#39;s been &quot;educated&quot; out of you ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith princess play, in particular, kids are learning about language, story, social relationships, and cultural aesthetics in addition to sensorial learning, sequencing, problem solving, gross and fine motor skills, and cause-and-effect. Depending on the specifics of their play, they may be learning about ethics/morality, social justice, and  mortality. Those are all common themes in the dramatic play of young children. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;4 hours of princess play...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Four hours isn&#39;t very long. It&#39;s a pretty average length of time for a child - or an adult for that matter - to be engaged in something interesting before being ready to shift gears. Since little kids tend to need to eat more often than that, it&#39;s a good idea to offer snacks - bring them right to where the kids are playing if they don&#39;t want to stop. Little end tables or plastic patio tables are handy for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ideas that school sets in adult minds is that children have limited attention spans. It&#39;s not true! Schools, including preschools, do a great disservice to children by setting them up to stop what they&#39;re doing after short periods of time - have you read the essay &quot;The Six Lesson Schoolteacher&quot; by John Gatto? He describes the way schools prevent kids from engaging in anything for long periods of time very caustically:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;The second lesson I teach kids is to turn on and off like a light switch. I demand that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor. But when the bell rings I insist that they drop the work at once and proceed quickly to the next work station. Nothing important is ever finished in my class, nor in any other class I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lesson of bells is that no work is worth finishing, so why care too deeply about anything? Bells are the secret logic of schooltime; their argument is inexorable; bells destroy past and future, converting every interval into a sameness, as an abstract map makes every living mountain and river the same even though they are not. Bells inoculate each undertaking with indifference.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole text is here, if you&#39;re interested:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html\">http://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;they dont want to stop when I try to interest them in any other activity<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some of that may be related to what I wrote above: that you&#39;re interrupting them when they&#39;re in the middle of something rather than waiting until they&#39;re at a transitional point. In addition to being counter-productive, that&#39;s rude! Adults get very frustrated when kids interrupt, but adults are typically horrible about interrupting children. So stop modelling interrupting ;) Be courteous and considerate of what your kids are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all means have other things to offer them, but wait until they let you know they&#39;re ready for something else. Over time, you&#39;ll get a sense of how long they naturally spend on various activities and you&#39;ll be able to use that as a way to plan. You&#39;ll probably find that your lives have a certain amount of organic structure to them purely through being sensitive to the natural rhythms of your kids&#39; play. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a collection of essays and ideas about unschooling with young children:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/toddlers\">http://sandradodd.com/toddlers</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276154527,"authorName":"littleflowerbug513","from":"&quot;littleflowerbug513&quot; &lt;littleflowerbug513@...&gt;","profile":"littleflowerbug513","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New to Unschooling","postDate":"1358082542","msgId":49376,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtjdWJsZStnaGsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48707,"nextInTopic":49377,"prevInTime":49375,"nextInTime":49377,"topicId":35908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi My name is Katie and my husband and I have 4 children ages 8, 5, 3 and almost 2.

He likes schedules, but probably doesn&#39;t like them to feel helpless or at the mercy of someone else&#39;s decisions - so work with him to create schedules which help him feel comfortable and in control. Think and plan ahead **and** make a back-up plan so you can change on the fly if necessary, but don&#39;t set him up to make a lot of decisions on the spur of the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy partner and daughter both find decision making in the moment overwhelming and sometimes default to saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; until their passivity makes whatever decision for them. That&#39;s frustrating for them as well as for me - they don&#39;t want to feel helpless and overwhelmed! So it&#39;s better for them if plans and decisions are made in advance. Ironically, that can result in a lot of last minute changes of plans with them - but somehow knowing there&#39;s a plan frees them up to say &quot;No, not that, I want this instead.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I know that when he has recovered from the trauma of the last 6 months of Distance education he will really love the flow of doing his own thing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my two, &quot;free flow&quot; looks a lot like there&#39;s a schedule. I&#39;m the working parent, and George is the home parent and when I get to be home for awhile I get to see their routines - they&#39;re very regular and predictable, but now and then the whole routine Bang! changes and there&#39;s a new routine. Sometimes something changes and there&#39;s no routine for awhile and whichever one will kind of flounder around for days or even a couple weeks, not having any idea what to do, dissatisfied with everything and generally in a funk. This spring they managed to coordinate their funks and I was ready to tear my hair out with both of them saying &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know&quot; about everything. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We started this discussion, but he got really upset at the thought of making<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that many choices( or any at all in fact)...We are currently on school holidays so we have some space to do this before his<br/>\nexpectation of formal lessons is likely to be a problem.<br/>\n****************<br/>\n<br/>\nGo slowly. Don&#39;t change everything all at once. If having a formal schedule is helpful to him, make one. It doesn&#39;t have to be all lessons, but help him structure his time so he&#39;s not overwhelmed by a gazzillion possibilities. But as I said before, be sure to have a back up plan so if the moment he says &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this&quot; you can say &quot;well, you really don&#39;t Have To, we can do this other thing&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sorts of things does he like to do? When does he have more energy and curiosity and when does he tend to want to relax? Make your schedule and back-up with those things in mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, my daughter likes to build with legos, draw (by hand and on the computer, watch movies, play video games, and jump on the trampoline. If I was to make a schedule I&#39;d start and end the day with energetic, creative things - draw until lunch, with trampoline breaks. In the middle of the day, I&#39;d schedule watching movies, some computer games in the afternoon, then maybe legos until she&#39;s ready for bed. I&#39;m cheating - that&#39;s what a lot of her days look like already! But I can see that her interests and energy follow a kind of pattern. On my &quot;schedule&quot; if she didn&#39;t want to draw, I&#39;d suggest something else creative, knowing that&#39;s most likely what she&#39;ll find appealing at that time of day. Do you see how that works? Your son will have natural ups and downs over the course of the day, so create a plan that reflects those. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso consider if there&#39;s a good &quot;emergency option&quot; - with Mo, it&#39;s &quot;lets go to Walmart&quot; (we could go other places, but we live on the edge of a small southern town - there&#39;s a Walmart. More than that involves an hour&#39;s drive). Getting out of the house helps her kind of reboot in a sense, when she&#39;s fallen into a big &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; funk. Unfortunately, her dad doesn&#39;t like to go out when He&#39;s in a funk, so for a few weeks I was coming home from work and going right back out again with Mo... whew! <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":409463070,"authorName":"magicfingers_aus","from":"&quot;magicfingers_aus&quot; &lt;magicfingers.stella@...&gt;","profile":"magicfingers_aus","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: New to Unschooling","postDate":"1341022595","msgId":48706,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzbG5pMytiaGljQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpzaTczaitocDU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48705,"nextInTopic":48707,"prevInTime":48705,"nextInTime":48707,"topicId":35908,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Unschooling can seem very vague and undefined at first, but at it&#39;s core unschooling is about learning and seeing that learning is a natural part of life. It may be that the best way to &quot;begin&quot; is for you to spend some time learning about learning on the one hand, and spend more time being warm and close with your son on the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nA good place to start reading is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/help\">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My boy is very rigid and does not like change<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s perfectly normal for to resist another person trying to change your life for you! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are you trying to get him to change?

But even if not, he may be that type of personality.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s old enough to have some idea of what he wants to do with his time, perhaps you and he could create a daily schedule together. He may not like change, in general, but if you let him know that his plans ARE flexible and subject to change if HE decides he&#39;s not happy with the plan, hopefully he&#39;ll be able to come up with an initial plan, and adapt to coming up with new plans/schedules as he feels the need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be difficult for many kids who have been in a typical school, being told what to do and where to go every minute of the day, to figure out what they want to do with themselves, at first.

But, if your son wants some kind of structure to his days (and possibly the opportunity to get together with groups of other kids), are there any programs/activities he can participate in after school hours? Something like sports or theater or a science club or comic-book/anime club, etc? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor things to do at home, what has he typically enjoyed doing on the weekends and holidays?
