It&#39;s comprised of women I really like and<br/>\n&gt; normally enjoy spending time with, however as the evening wore on the<br/>\n&gt; conversation turned to parenting teens and things got rather<br/>\n&gt; depressing - on their part because of their bleak outlook and for me<br/>\n&gt; because they couldn&#39;t see that it need not be that way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One mom that I&#39;m particularly close with has a 17 yo son and a 12 yo<br/>\n&gt; daughter. Her daughter usually attends the gatherings with her, but<br/>\n&gt; this time she decided not to come. When I asked her about this my<br/>\n&gt; friend said that lately she&#39;s just &quot;not a cool mom anymore&quot; and that<br/>\n&gt; her daughter has been distant and not as affectionate and isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; willing to spend time with her. She went on to say that things with<br/>\n&gt; her son are not getting any better (their relationship has been going<br/>\n&gt; downhill for a long while). She said, &quot;I feel lonely in my own home,<br/>\n&gt; my kids don&#39;t want to interact with me. I&#39;m just not cool to hang out<br/>\n&gt; with anymore.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A bit later the topic came up again and other moms joined in the rant<br/>\n&gt; about their own teens. One mom said it was like an alien creature<br/>\n&gt; suddenly landed in her home. Someone else said her teens are all aloof<br/>\n&gt; and distant and weird and seem to be interested in the strangest<br/>\n&gt; things. Others said similar things - their teens didn&#39;t seem to like<br/>\n&gt; them anymore, they didn&#39;t know who their friends were now, and that<br/>\n&gt; their teens had become so secretive and angry and closed-off. They<br/>\n&gt; were relating these things in a lighthearted &quot;that&#39;s life&quot; type of<br/>\n&gt; manner but I could hear the sadness and bitter resignation underneath<br/>\n&gt; the joking tone.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I said something like, &quot;See, stories like this have worried me and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought about it a lot.&quot; I shared my desire to have a different<br/>\n&gt; type of relationship with my kids when they are teens, by consciously<br/>\n&gt; choosing to create and cultivate that connection NOW.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My laughed bitterly and said, &#39;It doesn&#39;t matter what you plan for.<br/>\n&gt; Nothing you can do will make a difference - they&#39;re going to reach an<br/>\n&gt; age where they don&#39;t like you anymore and you don&#39;t know them and they<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t listen to you and things just go to hell.&quot; The other moms agreed<br/>\n&gt; - some huffed up and snorted in amusement at my wild ideas while<br/>\n&gt; others responded with concern that I was setting myself up for a big<br/>\n&gt; hurtful failure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I shook my head in disagreement and said, &#39;I don&#39;t think so&quot; but I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t feel comfortable pushing the issue. As I got silent the topic<br/>\n&gt; once again turned to complaints about how teens don&#39;t want to hang out<br/>\n&gt; with (or even talk to or be seen with) their parents. All I could<br/>\n&gt; think of was the wonderful images of the L&L dance and all the teens<br/>\n&gt; and parents and younger kids hanging out together and having a *great*<br/>\n&gt; time. I was saddened that it&#39;s an image so far removed from their<br/>\n&gt; world that they couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I came home I shared this experience with Chris and we talked<br/>\n&gt; through it. We basically reaffirmed that YES we will have a connected<br/>\n&gt; relationship with our future teens and what we do now and tomorrow and<br/>\n&gt; each day afterward *does* make a difference. Meeting all of the<br/>\n&gt; awesome teens at L&L (and seeing them interact with their parents) has<br/>\n&gt; been a big, shiny source of hope for us. Thank goodness I had the joy<br/>\n&gt; of observing those happy, healthy relationships before this<br/>\n&gt; conversation came up in a face-to-face discussion, otherwise I might<br/>\n&gt; tend to think that perhaps I *was* just being too optimistic and maybe<br/>\n&gt; a good parent/teen relationship only exists in the realm of<br/>\n&gt; far-fetched myths.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~ Susan<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Parenting Teens - what&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; is depressing!!","postDate":"1194022993","msgId":27495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcxMTAyMTAwM2g0MjEyZTRlYWgzZWViYjAyMTI2NzNmZjMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":27497,"prevInTime":27494,"nextInTime":27496,"topicId":27495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-=-=-=- I do not want surprises when he s 15, where he s might do a total flip , just like all my friends teenage kids done.

Why the surprise?<br/>\nThat&#39;s because when they are teen, they all of a sudden realised they<br/>\nhave a choice, the choice to listen to mum/ dad, or the choice to<br/>\nfollow their heart. Naturally the heart  always wins. &lt;snip&gt; Which<br/>\nexplains the moans of &quot;they are not doing what they always do;  this<br/>\nis so unlike them;  I don&#39;t know why he has changed&quot; &quot;they won&#39;t<br/>\nlisten!&quot; . That&#39;s because &quot;what they always do&quot;, is not their choice<br/>\nbut merely the adults (parents, relatives, society).<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDH & I were talking about this very thing the other night after I<br/>\nreturned from a gathering. It&#39;s comprised of women I really like and<br/>\nnormally enjoy spending time with, however as the evening wore on the<br/>\nconversation turned to parenting teens and things got rather<br/>\ndepressing - on their part because of their bleak outlook and for me<br/>\nbecause they couldn&#39;t see that it need not be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mom that I&#39;m particularly close with has a 17 yo son and a 12 yo<br/>\ndaughter. Her daughter usually attends the gatherings with her, but<br/>\nthis time she decided not to come. When I asked her about this my<br/>\nfriend said that lately she&#39;s just &quot;not a cool mom anymore&quot; and that<br/>\nher daughter has been distant and not as affectionate and isn&#39;t<br/>\nwilling to spend time with her. She went on to say that things with<br/>\nher son are not getting any better (their relationship has been going<br/>\ndownhill for a long while). She said, &quot;I feel lonely in my own home,<br/>\nmy kids don&#39;t want to interact with me. I&#39;m just not cool to hang out<br/>\nwith anymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit later the topic came up again and other moms joined in the rant<br/>\nabout their own teens. One mom said it was like an alien creature<br/>\nsuddenly landed in her home. Someone else said her teens are all aloof<br/>\nand distant and weird and seem to be interested in the strangest<br/>\nthings. Others said similar things - their teens didn&#39;t seem to like<br/>\nthem anymore, they didn&#39;t know who their friends were now, and that<br/>\ntheir teens had become so secretive and angry and closed-off. They<br/>\nwere relating these things in a lighthearted &quot;that&#39;s life&quot; type of<br/>\nmanner but I could hear the sadness and bitter resignation underneath<br/>\nthe joking tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said something like, &quot;See, stories like this have worried me and<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought about it a lot.&quot; I shared my desire to have a different<br/>\ntype of relationship with my kids when they are teens, by consciously<br/>\nchoosing to create and cultivate that connection NOW.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy laughed bitterly and said, &#39;It doesn&#39;t matter what you plan for.<br/>\nNothing you can do will make a difference - they&#39;re going to reach an<br/>\nage where they don&#39;t like you anymore and you don&#39;t know them and they<br/>\nwon&#39;t listen to you and things just go to hell.&quot; The other moms agreed<br/>\n- some huffed up and snorted in amusement at my wild ideas while<br/>\nothers responded with concern that I was setting myself up for a big<br/>\nhurtful failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI shook my head in disagreement and said, &#39;I don&#39;t think so&quot; but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel comfortable pushing the issue. As I got silent the topic<br/>\nonce again turned to complaints about how teens don&#39;t want to hang out<br/>\nwith (or even talk to or be seen with) their parents. All I could<br/>\nthink of was the wonderful images of the L&L dance and all the teens<br/>\nand parents and younger kids hanging out together and having a *great*<br/>\ntime. I was saddened that it&#39;s an image so far removed from their<br/>\nworld that they couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I came home I shared this experience with Chris and we talked<br/>\nthrough it. We basically reaffirmed that YES we will have a connected<br/>\nrelationship with our future teens and what we do now and tomorrow and<br/>\neach day afterward *does* make a difference. Meeting all of the<br/>\nawesome teens at L&L (and seeing them interact with their parents) has<br/>\nbeen a big, shiny source of hope for us. Thank goodness I had the joy<br/>\nof observing those happy, healthy relationships before this<br/>\nconversation came up in a face-to-face discussion, otherwise I might<br/>\ntend to think that perhaps I *was* just being too optimistic and maybe<br/>\na good parent/teen relationship only exists in the realm of<br/>\nfar-fetched myths.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27393,"nextTopicId":324}}
