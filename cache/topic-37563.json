It was his Ph.D. dissertation work. I can remember sitting in his house watching slides of children of the Okavango Delta Peoples of Botswana trying to crush mongongo nuts to compare how many they could crush in an hour versus an untrained adult. He looked at how much food they could gather compared with how much caloric output their somewhat clumsy fishing and other kinds of gathering produced. He found that they were more of a burden than an assistance. Certainly at younger ages children&#39;s work was much more about keeping them busy than it was about accruing resources to extend a family&#39;s ability to survive.<br/>\nWhich is like the little bit I can remember from Dr. Spock&#39;s Baby and<br/>\nChildcare book when he wrote about taking your toddler for a walk and how you should expect a block to take an hour given all the potential distractions along the path. <br/>\n<br/>\nOoh, here&#39;s a relevant quote from a paper (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockJohnson.pdf)\">http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockJohnson.pdf)</a> looking at subsistance ecology and play: <br/>\n<br/>\nThis leads us to expect that a householdâ€™s participation in<br/>\nagriculture will decrease the amount of time spent in play, since there is<br/>\nsubstantial evidence in this (Bock 2002b) and other traditional communities<br/>\n(Blurton Jones et al. 1989; Bulatao and Arnold 1977; Cain 1977; Caldwell<br/>\n1982; Lee and Kramer 2002; see Kaplan and Bock 2001b for a review)<br/>\nthat children are more able to contribute to the household economy in<br/>\nfarming subsistence ecologies than in foraging or herding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt suggests that it is only recently that we&#39;ve been handing out chores to ensure subsistance. It might challenge a rawist approach to chores given that chores may have only been around as long as cooking (so 250,000 years), actually, not even that long. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this reminds of Rob Walker&#39;s work on hunting proficiency among<br/>\nboys and men of the Ache of Paraguay. He found that Ache hunters were<br/>\nat their hunting peak at between 37 and 42 years of age<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eva.mpg.de/ipse/staff/walker/pdfs/achehunt.pdf)\">http://www.eva.mpg.de/ipse/staff/walker/pdfs/achehunt.pdf)</a>. Children don&#39;t help a lot when hunting with their uncles. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Bock wrote a paper (Evolutionary Demography and Intrahousehold Time Allocation:School Attendance and Child Labor Among the Okavango Delta Peoples of Botswana) that had this in it&#39;s summary:<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps most significant for policy implications<br/>\nis that whether or not a specific<br/>\nchild would benefit from attending school<br/>\nwas not a significant predictor of school attendance.<br/>\nRather, the degree to which parents&#39;<br/>\nown reproductive interests were<br/>\nserved was the primary predictor of which<br/>\nchildren attended school. <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockAJHB.pdf)\">http://anthro.fullerton.edu/jbock/BockAJHB.pdf)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo rephrase, parents were manipulating their children&#39;s labor and education to suit the parents&#39; needs. I consider myself really lucky to not have to do that. I get to choose to give Simon and Linnaea the freedom of my reproductive interests so that they can choose the things that will most benefit themselves. I don&#39;t need to pull them away from those things that will give them their best outcome in order to have my needs met. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Meridith Richardson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ruttegar@...\">ruttegar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, 5 January, 2009 8:42:00 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Moving toward more peaceful parenting and help with dh<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntrue and natural it has been since the beginning of time where anthropology can show us how humans shared &quot;chores&quot; to make sure life continued.

It used to be 8 but they wanted to each sponser an endangered animal for the other, so Linnaea sponsers Simon&#39;s tiger and Simon sponsers Linnaea&#39;s orangutan. I also buy things that I can afford that I think they will enjoy. I pay for two WoW accounts, I pay for headphones for Simon so that he can listen to the computer in the same room as the television, they seem to break fairly regularly, and I replace them, I buy their clothes and pay for outings. Their money is completely discretionary. They get to choose what they do with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI decided that I didn&#39;t like holding all the cards when it came to money and purchases. I decided that I wanted them to have power over what they bought and what they saved for and what they didn&#39;t really want. And I still like getting things for them, so when I feel flush enough, I get things that I choose or that I know they&#39;d like. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe money isn&#39;t free. They totally understand that their dad works for money. They also understand that money is how we pay for things. To heat the house, to pay the rent, to have a tuna sandwich, it all takes money. They don&#39;t live in a vacuum without any awareness of how things work. The other day we went into to town to get video games with their Christmas money. Simon knew precisely what he wanted, having watched youtube Let&#39;s Plays of different games to see what he would like and having looked at reviews at Gamespot.com. Linnaea had really enjoyed Fable 2, so she and I went looking for games that were similar, doing a lot of research for the kind of evil to good continuum that Fable has as well as looking for a game with a dog for a pet. Turns out Fallout 3 has both those things. Anyhow, so we were in town at the game store looking through all the games and I noticed that they had a Sims 2 expansion pack that she didn&#39;t have and pointed it out. She<br/>\n picked it up and looked at it and then said &quot;You know, I want it, but I don&#39;t want it right now. Not more than I want the other game,&quot; and she put it back.

The rationale behind it is that both DH and I work for our <br/>\nmoney, and that&#39;s the way the world works. No one is just handing us <br/>\nmoney simply for being there. So I feel OK about the allowance for <br/>\nchores thing. We all discussed it, and we have a list of what needs <br/>\nto be done in the house. Each of us chooses which chores to do. If <br/>\nthe chore one person wanted to do is already done, that person needs <br/>\nto choose something else. That way I&#39;m not dictating what needs to be <br/>\ndone by whom, but everything gets done. If he doesn&#39;t do any chores, <br/>\nno allowance for that day. We also pay on my paydays, with a note <br/>\nsaying what he gets and why he may or may not have gotten a certain <br/>\namount. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I struggled with this a lot. I wanted him to learn the value of <br/>\n </span></blockquote>work and money, and I wanted him to be responsible for his own debts <br/>\n(WoW, XBox Live, etc.). I don&#39;t make him pay for clothing or food, <br/>\nsince we (DH and I) pool our money to cover all those expenses. <br/>\nUnless, of course, he wants something he doesn&#39;t really need - like <br/>\nexpensive sneakers or $75 jeans. We base what he needs on whether he <br/>\nhas something that is a reasonable substitute. If he has three pairs <br/>\nof sneakers, he doesn&#39;t need new ones, for example.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t consider the allowance thing to be coercive, any more than <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I feel coerced at the grocery store to pay for my purchases or by my <br/>\nboss for having to come in to work to get the paycheck.

So, when you notice a trigger, have a plan. Breathe.<br/>\n&gt; Breathe<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some more. Remove yourself from the situation for a minute to stop<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever cycle you are beginning to enter. Exhaustion is common<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you have small children and you have three. It will not be like<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; forever! But giving your kids the gift of a frustrated-less- often<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mother will help your relationships.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At any rate, I&#39;m sad to see my son<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; respond the way he does. He&#39;s very quick to offer an apology for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; upsetting<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me, when really he was just being a kid. He&#39;ll preface things by<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saying &quot;I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t want to upset you, but&quot;, etc. It has really gotten my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention as to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how it feels for him. The other day, I noticed how bad the<br/>\n&gt; bottom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foot has gotten (they peel, and he picks at it, and now it is<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; red and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raw with a couple of deep fissures that make me nervous about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; infection).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I asked to look at them more closely, and mentioned that<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to go to the doctor to see if she has any ideas. He totally<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flipped,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poor guy. He was cowering in the corner of my bed, shaking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, you know that he has fear around doctor&#39;s visits. Maybe,<br/>\n&gt; before<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you mention that likelihood to him, research the possibilities for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; healing his foot without going to the doctor. There are<br/>\n&gt; naturopaths<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and homeopaths who don&#39;t use needles and have success with such<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ongoing issues. But, you could inform yourself first.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning<br/>\n&gt; having<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shots.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a<br/>\n&gt; scary<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since<br/>\n&gt; then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get me started about that decision--he turned up positive to<br/>\n&gt; three<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foods,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; testing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when I never would have done it w/o his insistence. I&#39;ve learned<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I told him that the only thing I could anticipate him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting shots<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for would be if he got bitten by an animal somehow (course<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our dog<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next<br/>\n&gt; day,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; okay.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure I would even bring this up to my daughter, who has a<br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of fear around doctors, dentists and needles. It would set up<br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; &gt; fear in her mind about being bitten by a dog and what would happen<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after that.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for<br/>\n&gt; infection. It<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr.<br/>\n&gt; V.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knows how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that). I said<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doctor,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prudent (like<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; So, it might be better not to try to help him feel more relaxed.<br/>\n&gt; Go<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when you really need to go and help him *right then* with his<br/>\n&gt; fears.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t talk about what may or may not happen, because that can be<br/>\n&gt; &gt; stressful. I used to do just this kind of thing with my very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; sensitive, reactive, and imaginative daughter and it would just<br/>\n&gt; set<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her up for too much worrying about the future. I thought I was<br/>\n&gt; helping<br/>\n&gt; &gt; by &quot;preparing&quot; her. It didn&#39;t help much at all, especially if I<br/>\n&gt; went<br/>\n&gt; &gt; into detail or talked about it more than once.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I<br/>\n&gt; asked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to see<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot;<br/>\n&gt; (we<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s). It actually<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really nice opportunity to heal, I think. I just assured him<br/>\n&gt; that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I<br/>\n&gt; love<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him for<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who he is, etc. I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My dd doesn&#39;t like to be talked about either. It can be construed<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; &gt; disrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor<br/>\n&gt; *her*<br/>\n&gt; &gt; need for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she<br/>\n&gt; sees<br/>\n&gt; &gt; herself, too.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in<br/>\n&gt; front<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of<br/>\n&gt; concern)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually. I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right<br/>\n&gt; now,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc. and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; how senstive he is to criticism. My parents have done a lot of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found it was important to protect my daughter from those<br/>\n&gt; &gt; comparisons by not over-emphasizing her differences, nor<br/>\n&gt; entertaining<br/>\n&gt; &gt; much discussion with grandparents about it. All kids have their<br/>\n&gt; own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; timelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Explaining too much can sound like defensiveness. Being a child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; advocate sometimes means diverting attention.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I notice there are many situations and explanations throughout<br/>\n&gt; your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; post. Then you ask how you can heal the relationship without<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; telling us what you think your relationship is with your son. If<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; can think about that, then tell us what you believe is missing or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; needs repair, that will help clarify, both for you and the list<br/>\n&gt; members.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; There may be some value to journalling about these things.

Still, he wants to go over there frequently.  I talk with him<br/>\nabout how he feels about those things, and he usually just shrugs and says<br/>\nhe still wants to go over.  So, I follow his lead.  What makes me nervous,<br/>\nand something that I don&#39;t think many here would agree with, is I don&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike children can always weigh multi-factorial decisons like that.<br/>\nCertainly he knows that he enjoys going over there, and right now, the<br/>\nbenefits outweigh the costs, but I admit I&#39;m concerned about damage they may<br/>\ncause.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in front<br/>\n&gt; of me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of concern)<br/>\n&gt; I might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>\n&gt; &gt; actually.

But, you could inform yourself first.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; See, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning having <br/>\n&gt; shots.<br/>\n&gt; We actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a scary <br/>\n&gt; reaction<br/>\n&gt; to the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since then <br/>\n&gt; has<br/>\n&gt; been bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family. <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; get me started about that decision--he turned up positive to three <br/>\n&gt; foods,<br/>\n&gt; only to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive, <br/>\n&gt; that it<br/>\n&gt; could be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for the <br/>\n&gt; testing,<br/>\n&gt; when I never would have done it w/o his insistence. I&#39;ve learned a <br/>\n&gt; lot<br/>\n&gt; about standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I told him that the only thing I could anticipate him <br/>\n&gt; getting shots<br/>\n&gt; for would be if he got bitten by an animal somehow (course doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; our dog<br/>\n&gt; go and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next day, <br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I would even bring this up to my daughter, who has a lot <br/>\nof fear around doctors, dentists and needles. It would set up another <br/>\nfear in her mind about being bitten by a dog and what would happen <br/>\nafter that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection. It<br/>\n&gt; was also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr. V. <br/>\n&gt; knows how<br/>\n&gt; much he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor <br/>\n&gt; that). I said<br/>\n&gt; this in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to the <br/>\n&gt; doctor,<br/>\n&gt; which though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is <br/>\n&gt; prudent (like<br/>\n&gt; with his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So, it might be better not to try to help him feel more relaxed. Go <br/>\nwhen you really need to go and help him *right then* with his fears. <br/>\nDon&#39;t talk about what may or may not happen, because that can be <br/>\nstressful. I used to do just this kind of thing with my very <br/>\nsensitive, reactive, and imaginative daughter and it would just set <br/>\nher up for too much worrying about the future. I thought I was helping <br/>\nby &quot;preparing&quot; her. It didn&#39;t help much at all, especially if I went <br/>\ninto detail or talked about it more than once.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; At any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked <br/>\n&gt; to see<br/>\n&gt; his foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot; (we <br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; watched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s). It actually <br/>\n&gt; was a<br/>\n&gt; really nice opportunity to heal, I think. I just assured him that I <br/>\n&gt; would<br/>\n&gt; never intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s what he<br/>\n&gt; thought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I love <br/>\n&gt; him for<br/>\n&gt; who he is, etc. I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about <br/>\n&gt; talking<br/>\n&gt; about him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly and <br/>\n&gt; out of<br/>\n&gt; concern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dd doesn&#39;t like to be talked about either. It can be construed as <br/>\ndisrespect. Not every person feels this way, but I need to honor *her* <br/>\nneed for privacy. How I see her will be different from how she sees <br/>\nherself, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember it this way: if my husband was talking about me, in front <br/>\nof me, to others (even if it was loving, with pride or out of concern) <br/>\nI might feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and possibly miffed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>\n&gt; actually. I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right now, <br/>\n&gt; etc. and<br/>\n&gt; how senstive he is to criticism.

All kids have their own <br/>\ntimelines, quirks, and fears, some more apparent than others. <br/>\nExplaining too much can sound like defensiveness.

Now,<br/>\nI&#39;m about to take several risks in posting this here, so please keep in mind<br/>\nthat if I didn&#39;t recognize the need for change, and wasn&#39;t willing, I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be posting, and that I&#39;m in a vulnerable place atm (fighting back<br/>\nagainst some depression that&#39;s cropping up atm), when you reply to me.  I<br/>\nhope that&#39;s not perceived as rude, but this list seems to appreciate<br/>\ndirectness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a very stressful day yesterday; my sleep apnea is horrid from my<br/>\nall-night bout with the stomach bug earlier in the week and exhaustion is<br/>\nprolly the number one trigger for my less-than ideal parenting choices<br/>\n(mostly barking at the kids for being kids), I also notice that I get most<br/>\nfrustrated when trying to complete a task that requires any level of<br/>\nconcentration (already a challenge when exhausted), and the volume level<br/>\ngets really high.  I&#39;m working on that, but the first step was noticing what<br/>\nthe triggers are.  I absolutely love the posts that were put on here a<br/>\ncouple of days ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point though, I&#39;m correcting myself after the fact and really<br/>\nhopeful that I get to the point of catching myself before, which I&#39;ve<br/>\ncertainly done, but not near enough.  At any rate, I&#39;m sad to see my son<br/>\nrespond the way he does.  He&#39;s very quick to offer an apology for upsetting<br/>\nme, when really he was just being a kid.  He&#39;ll preface things by saying &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to upset you, but&quot;, etc.  It has really gotten my attention as to<br/>\nhow it feels for him.  The other day, I noticed how bad the bottom of his<br/>\nfoot has gotten (they peel, and he picks at it, and now it is really red and<br/>\nraw with a couple of deep fissures that make me nervous about infection).<br/>\nAnyway, I asked to look at them more closely, and mentioned that it might be<br/>\ntime to go to the doctor to see if she has any ideas.  He totally flipped,<br/>\npoor guy.  He was cowering in the corner of my bed, shaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, he&#39;s had this paranoia about going to the doctor meaning having shots.<br/>\nWe actually stopped vaxing several years ago, when he had a scary reaction<br/>\nto the DTaP, and the only thing &quot;shot-like&quot; that he&#39;s had since then has<br/>\nbeen bloodwork to evaluate for allergies which run in my family.  Don&#39;t even<br/>\nget me started about that decision--he turned up positive to three foods,<br/>\nonly to have the allergist say that it was such a weak positive, that it<br/>\ncould be ignored, and then imply in his notes that I pushed for the testing,<br/>\nwhen I never would have done it w/o his insistence.  I&#39;ve learned a lot<br/>\nabout standing up to doctors the last few years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I told him that the only thing I could anticipate him getting shots<br/>\nfor would be if he got bitten by an animal somehow (course doesn&#39;t our dog<br/>\ngo and accidentally bite him and break the skin the very next day, but it&#39;s<br/>\nokay.  I ran it by the doc and they said just to watch it for infection.  It<br/>\nwas also another opportunity to assure him that I know and Dr. V. knows how<br/>\nmuch he doesn&#39;t want shots and we are doing our best to honor that).  I said<br/>\nthis in an effort to help him feel more relaxed about going to the doctor,<br/>\nwhich though we don&#39;t do it often, there are times when it is prudent (like<br/>\nwith his foot and when he had Lyme&#39;s Disease for the 2nd time).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, he says to me while balled up on my bed after I asked to see<br/>\nhis foot &quot;but I&#39;m just different like the guy with Tourette&#39;s&quot; (we just<br/>\nwatched a movie about a man living with Tourette&#39;s).  It actually was a<br/>\nreally nice opportunity to heal, I think.  I just assured him that I would<br/>\nnever intend to make fun of him, that I&#39;m really sorry that&#39;s what he<br/>\nthought, that it&#39;s totally okay to be who he is, and how much I love him for<br/>\nwho he is, etc.  I&#39;m very aware that I need to be cautious about talking<br/>\nabout him to others, as even though I&#39;m always doing so lovingly and out of<br/>\nconcern, or pride, he doesn&#39;t hear it that way.  He&#39;s a lot like me<br/>\nactually.  I&#39;ve told my mother, etc., that we can&#39;t talk right now, etc. and<br/>\nhow senstive he is to criticism.  My parents have done a lot of comparing<br/>\nhim to my niece, who is his age, re: his fears for TV shows, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love suggestions about continuing to help us heal that relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to another challenge---dh!  First off, no one needs to tell me how<br/>\ngreat he is.  I know it.  He&#39;s a phenomenal man, and I love and adore him<br/>\nimmensely.  He loves his kids dearly, although he admits that 3 is stressful<br/>\nto him (me too at times).  He comes from a very traditional parenting<br/>\nbackground, as do most of us, and really is of the belief that kids need to<br/>\nrespect and listen to their parents just b/c.  I have to admit to fighting<br/>\nthat mindset for myself at times.  At any rate, I&#39;ve been broaching small<br/>\nthings with him, w/o saying I heard about it here, b/c he dismisses it then,<br/>\nlike the wish list board idea, and was going to bring up allowance when he<br/>\nhopefully gets a small raise in March (no guarantee with the economy, of<br/>\ncourse).  Well, he brings up allowance himself the other day and I was<br/>\nencouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, he mentions having it tied to chores (kinda laid back, but, still).<br/>\nUnfortunately, I kind of jumped on him, in that I was so taken aback, that I<br/>\nsaid &quot;No&quot;, rather firmly.  Which I apologized for later, and explained (I<br/>\nwas trying to nurse my youngest to sleep, so that was another reason that I<br/>\nwas more abrupt).  I explained to him that having chores tied to allowance<br/>\nwas just setting us all up to fail.  I don&#39;t think he buys it.  Honestly,<br/>\nwe&#39;re both overwhelmed with how often they all drop things on the ground and<br/>\njust leave them there.  I don&#39;t have high standards, by any means, but I&#39;m<br/>\nvery clumsy, and have often hurt myself b/c of things left on the floor.  I<br/>\nreally worry when I am carrying the 2 yr old, and can&#39;t see obstacles as<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, how do I go about making the positive changes I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nmake, while feeling like I&#39;m causing tension in my relationship?  More<br/>\nimportantly, how can I respect my husband&#39;s concerns and still make changes<br/>\nthat I truly believe are necessary for my children&#39;s well-being?  He has<br/>\nnever been a fan of my decision to homeschool, not to mention unschool, and<br/>\nthis and deciding to have a 3rd child have really been the only times we&#39;ve<br/>\ndisagreed (in any major way) in 17 yrs of knowing each other.  I think he&#39;s<br/>\nmore comfortable with homeschooling, as he&#39;s been able to admit that Josh<br/>\nreally is motivated to learn on his own (which he highly doubted in the<br/>\npast), but he still thinks Josh would benefit from ideas from someone other<br/>\nthan me, from teachers&#39; years of experience, and that it is more work than<br/>\nit is worth (i.e. school doesn&#39;t damage kids).  So, it&#39;s challenging for<br/>\nsure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;ve rambled on more than I intended.  I know I brought up several<br/>\nissues, and maybe it would have been better to do it in separate posts,<br/>\nbut....I&#39;m nervous, but also looking forward to your responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37548,"nextTopicId":37727}}
