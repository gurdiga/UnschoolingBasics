I never expected unschooling to be so <br/>\n  much fun. In a way, it’s been a kind of an endless summer: eight years <br/>\n  of watching Rain follow her whims and her dreams and of learning and <br/>\n  growing alongside her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  With unschooling, no two days are the same. Some days we rise late and <br/>\n  spend the day puttering around the house, maybe baking pancakes and <br/>\n  reading together, gardening or watching movies. Other days we’re up <br/>\n  early and off to museums or classes or berry-picking or visits with <br/>\n  friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Although we rarely spend an entire day together anymore, I think I <br/>\n  spend more time with her than do most parents of teens. I really enjoy <br/>\n  hearing her ideas and insights and jokes, and just being with her. In <br/>\n  my very biased opinion, she’s a pretty wonderful person.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most of the time, I don’t think in terms of traditional academics at <br/>\n  all. When Rain was younger, schooled children would sometimes quiz her <br/>\n  on the things they were learning in their classes, like multiplication <br/>\n  facts or spelling words. They would forecast a lifetime of doom and <br/>\n  gloom for her, and sometimes she would come home upset and determined <br/>\n  to master the skills the schooled kids were working on.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I walked a fine line, trying to support in achieving her stated goals <br/>\n  while pointing out the things that she knew that most kids didn’t, and <br/>\n  gently sharing my conviction that learning things on her own timetable <br/>\n  didn’t mean she would never learn them, if she needed to know them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  When she was 10 or so, her hitherto almost nonexistent writing skills <br/>\n  blossomed, and within a year she was keeping a blog or two and writing <br/>\n  beautiful stories. A couple of years later, she wrote a thoughtful <br/>\n  essay requesting a scholarship to a summer program and was awarded the <br/>\n  highest amount possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It didn’t matter at all that when she was 9, she would have struggled <br/>\n  to write a simple paragraph. Her writing score on the SAT she took as <br/>\n  an eighth-grader was well above that achieved by the average <br/>\n  college-bound high school senior. She wrote when she was ready, and she <br/>\n  enjoyed it, and I enjoyed bearing witness to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n  There’s an idea among some people that home schooling parents need to <br/>\n  know everything their children will learn, or they’ll need to hire a <br/>\n  tutor for those topics. I haven’t found this to be true. Learning <br/>\n  occurs independently of teaching most of the time, and most of what I <br/>\n  know was never explicitly taught to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Indeed, I’m often surprised by what Rain knows. Through books, <br/>\n  television, radio, talking with people, Internet browsing, classes, <br/>\n  live lectures and perhaps osmosis, she’s acquired a rich tapestry of <br/>\n  background knowledge and an impressive skill base. The availability of <br/>\n  resources for learning in today’s world is amazing to me, and Rain has <br/>\n  learned to maneuver this world with dexterity and grace.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I’m always here if she needs me, but I would never want to be her only <br/>\n  source of information. I like that she can explore the world and make <br/>\n  her own choices. She doesn’t always agree with me, and I think that’s a <br/>\n  good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don’t consider unschooling to be a sacrifice on my part but an active <br/>\n  negotiation between the two of us. In our family, we pull together, and <br/>\n  unschooling is just an extension of that. Since Rain was born, I’ve <br/>\n  always either worked or been a student or both, and I’ve tried to apply <br/>\n  the principles of unschooling to my life as well as Rain’s.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do the things that I want to do, and I truly enjoy all facets of my <br/>\n  life (well, except housework!).
