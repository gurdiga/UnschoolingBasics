I decided then and there this was not what I wanted him to get out of his time learning. I want him to LOVE learning and he always has until I put it in formal terms, i.e the three R&#39;s. <br/>\n  Now we go to museums, zoos, read all the time, cook together, do chores, paint pictures......that&#39;s about it. <br/>\n  I am in California so we are not required to keep records for kindergarten, although when we get to 1st grade I believe all that is required is attendance keeping. We still work with letters informally with a flash card game now and then, and he can add and subtract the low numbers and count into the hundreds....<br/>\n  He used to do city sports but has opted out of those for now. He plays on the computer, plays with toys, making up games. <br/>\n  I am fortunate that we have a homeschooling support group that he has made friends in and we do PE days and park days together. <br/>\n  It makes me a little nervous sometimes, wondering if I am doing the right thing. However, HE is the one who LOVES to do all the activities he is doing, and that is what is most important to me. <br/>\n  I had a conversation with a friend the other day who was telling me kids need to learn to achieve, to sink or swim, blah,blah,blah....... and who am I to tell her different at this stage?...

Anyway a lot of days all she wants to do is arts and crafts (we spent today making Christmas Tree Ornaments).  But then other days she will read, read and write like crazy.  To me, even if a person was going to traditionally school a 5 year old child, it should be a time of exploring and wonder.  Let her play in the mud, blow bubbles, and bake cookies with Mom.  The other stuff will come later. Years ago KIndy was about finger painting and singing songs.  Todays Kindy seems to be about academic pressure.  And that would be one of many reasons I homeschool, so that my kids can do things when they are ready.......and it&#39;s not forced on them.  Now my girls are both computer obsessed.  I signed them up for a computer curriculum (Math and Language Arts) called Time 4 Learning.  They both do it on their own (no prompting from me) everyday, and they love it.  Now Time 4<br/>\n Learning even grades everything for the parent, you can go in and get reports.  Now I just let the girls do the program because they love it, I do not give them grades or report cards so I never look at the grades or reports.  But it&#39;s very interactive and engaging for little ones.  Something to consider.  I&#39;m sure other&#39;s will have better portfolio advice than I do.  I have a big plastic box for each child, and I just throw everything they do into the boxes.  I also write down what we do each day.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\natomickiss2001 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenpmobley@...\">jenpmobley@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          do any of you here have kindergarten aged children? my daughter is 5 <br/>\nand she really doesn&#39;t want to do any work except art related stuff. <br/>\nshe can count by 5&#39;s and 10&#39;s but still does her numbers in the wrong <br/>\ndirections sometimes.
