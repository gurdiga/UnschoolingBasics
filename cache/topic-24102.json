I <br/>\nadmit that I have not totally embraced the freedom for children that <br/>\nmany of you espouse.  I couldn&#39;t help but add my 2 cents here.<br/>\n  I am a single mom and have at times stuggled with my relationship <br/>\nand my daughter&#39;s relationship with my mom.  What I have learned in <br/>\nthe process is<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Safety is first.  ALWAYS.  No compromising on this one.<br/>\n2 - Validate my daughter&#39;s feelings and my mom&#39;s.  &quot;Wow.  It really <br/>\nis frustrating when Grandma is constantly telling you to do things.  <br/>\nI remember how tough she was when I was growing up.&quot;  &quot;Gee, Mom, I <br/>\ncan see how it hurts you that she&#39;s not happy to see you even though <br/>\nyou bought her a gift.&quot; - NO BUTs at this point.  Let them just feel <br/>\nlike you see their point.<br/>\n3 - Eventually teach.  Don&#39;t make excuses or argue. Teach. When your <br/>\ngrandparent is ready give small concise instructions on how to make <br/>\nthings work better.  Remember that they may still choose to blame and <br/>\ncomplain rather than learn but try to give them small concise things <br/>\nin a friendly non-judgemental way to help the relationship.  A big <br/>\none for my daughter was telling my mom not to lecture.  I briefly <br/>\nexplained that since my daughter is entering those teenage years she <br/>\nprefers brief explanations so please try to keep instructions to 5-10 <br/>\nwords.  I had to tell my mom 50 times or so (and smile every time) <br/>\nbut she is doing a lot better.<br/>\n4 - Teach your kids too. Once again try not to be judgemental or make <br/>\nexcuses.  Think about it for a moment.  How would you explain both <br/>\nsides of any major war?  How would you explain various world <br/>\nreligions?  Is there a RIGHT and a WRONG or do they both have good <br/>\nand bad points?  Try to see the point of view that the grandparents <br/>\nare coming from.  They probably came from a generation in which <br/>\nadults (especially older adults) were given respect because they were <br/>\nolder than you.  Age earned respect.  Also, many feel that their <br/>\nphysical abuse is ok because it&#39;s not as bad as what they grew up <br/>\nwith.  When my grandparents called my mom had to run to answer or she <br/>\nwas in trouble and during that time period that was &#39;normal&#39;.  I made <br/>\na CHOICE to not raise my child the way I was raised but my mom wasn&#39;t <br/>\npart of that choice and doesn&#39;t know another way.  She is coming <br/>\naround.  Explaining these ideas and motivations to kids honestly and <br/>\nexposing them for what they are allows kids the power to understand <br/>\nand choose anger or compassion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the things that have made my family able to live with one <br/>\nanother.  Yes, we 3 live together.  Some days I feel like I have 2 <br/>\nchildren and my daughter is the oldest but most of the time it <br/>\nworks.  My mom has become handicapped and we have gone from not <br/>\nspeaking to a fairly good realtionship where we live together and I <br/>\ntake care of the physical needs and she takes care of the financial <br/>\nneeds.  She is even teaching my daughter to cross-stitch (MIRACLE!) <br/>\nwith only a little bit of fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Another grandparent issue","postDate":"1180538756","msgId":24139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTcwRTVGM0VCQTQzNS0xNjQwLTNEMDNAV0VCTUFJTC1EQzExLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyNTc5NC45NzA2Ny5xbUB3ZWI2MDgxNC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24138,"nextInTopic":24148,"prevInTime":24138,"nextInTime":24140,"topicId":24102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But more <br/>\nimportantly, my boys are nice to her. Given the *choice* to be with her <br/>\nor not has empowered them to be kinder because they understand they <br/>\ndon&#39;t *have* to be there---it&#39;s their *choice*---and they certainly can <br/>\nchoose to be somewhere else. If they choose to be with *her*---well, <br/>\nthey *want* to be there, and they make the best of it. That&#39;s better <br/>\nfor *all* of them (us!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sure that if we had forced them to spend time with her, they <br/>\nwould have resented her and us and eventually refused to spend *any* <br/>\ntime with her at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the older they get, the more they can handle difficult people. <br/>\nBut when they&#39;re too little to stand up to her (or drive away!), the <br/>\nmore it&#39;s *my* resposibility to protect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

They are not<br/>\nallowed in my house for the nasty comments they have<br/>\nmade to me in front of my kids about the way our house<br/>\nlooks (it&#39;s not white glove, but it is also not messy,<br/>\neither.) or that I should do this or that with the<br/>\nkids.  Nothing I ever do is right. They constantly<br/>\ncriticize, and it&#39;s not healthy for my kids or for me.<br/>\n Dh probably doesn&#39;t see this, because he is used to<br/>\nit, or because of the fact that they always make the<br/>\ncomments when he is not around.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now my kids are very comfortable not seeing<br/>\ntheir grandparents that live close, and would rather<br/>\nsee mine that are 550 miles away.  Not because they<br/>\nspend money on them (they are both retired and are on<br/>\nlimited income), but because they spend quality time<br/>\nwith them, by having campfires, playing games,<br/>\nwatching movies, etc.  The grandparents that are here,<br/>\ndo none of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have told dh several times that if he pushed the<br/>\nkids into visiting his parents it will only backfire,<br/>\nand will do more harm than good.

So he knows the kids have<br/>\nproblems with his parents, but I think he just doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to accept it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey ( il) constantly pick at the kids and will tell<br/>\ndd to sit up there and eat (she&#39;s a slow eater, and<br/>\ngets full easier than ds), and will make comments<br/>\nabout ds being over weight, and things like that.  All<br/>\nof the boys on dh&#39;s side of the family are built big. <br/>\nMil has no daughters, only 3 sons.  I have the only<br/>\ngranddaughter in this side of the family.  The sad<br/>\npart is that they don&#39;t know my kids, and have never<br/>\ntaken the time to get to know them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have adjusted well, and are very comfortable<br/>\nwith who they are, and what they are doing.

If your daughter is<br/>\nhappy, there is no problem, and it sounds like she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf public school works for your grandchildren, then<br/>\nthat&#39;s ok.  My kids had a horrible time in public<br/>\nschool, and I wish I would&#39;ve pulled them out sooner. <br/>\nJust because she doesn&#39;t go to school, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nshe is learning.  There is so much out there in the<br/>\nworld to learn, and to do.  You don&#39;t get that from<br/>\nsitting behind a desk for 6-8 hours a day, learning a<br/>\nlittle of this and that, and not anything interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am with you, and I can see why it would upset your<br/>\nhusband too.  I&#39;ve been through high school, and she&#39;s<br/>\nnot missing anything.  No peer pressure, drugs, bombs,<br/>\nthreats, etc.  My son actually had a death threat<br/>\nagainst him, and he&#39;s only 11. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some.  I think your dil needs to<br/>\nencourage your 13 yo, not tell her what she feels your<br/>\ndaughter is missing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care, and let me know how things go.<br/>\n--- nrskay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:k_bird@...\">k_bird@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My problem is kind of unique.

My  <br/>\n&gt; older son doesn&#39;t much care to see my parents<br/>\n&gt; because my parents are  <br/>\n&gt; not very affectionate. My father doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>\n&gt; give my older  <br/>\n&gt; son Eric, who is six, time to warm up when we first<br/>\n&gt; arrive at their  <br/>\n&gt; house, but immediately wants Eric to, say, hug, him.<br/>\n&gt; This has been  <br/>\n&gt; the pattern since Eric was 2 or so:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My dad: Give grandpa a hug!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eric stands quietly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My dad: Give me a hug!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eric scoots closer to me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My dad, yelling: ERIC! COME GIVE GRANDPA A HUG!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eric gets into my lap and stays there for an hour.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Carl, 3, is much quicker to warm up, and has a more<br/>\n&gt; outgoing  <br/>\n&gt; personality. In the last year, when we visit, my<br/>\n&gt; mother doesn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; bother to hide her preference for Carl over Eric.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My whole life, my parents treated me badly because I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t what they  <br/>\n&gt; wanted in a daughter. Now they are increasingly<br/>\n&gt; indifferent to my  <br/>\n&gt; kids, Eric especially, because he doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; fit some  <br/>\n&gt; preconceived notion they have about what a grandson<br/>\n&gt; should be like.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Neither of my parents is able to think of others,<br/>\n&gt; and put someone  <br/>\n&gt; else&#39;s feelings ahead of their own. Not even small<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why wouldn&#39;t a kid want to see his grandparents?<br/>\n&gt; Because he&#39;s smart  <br/>\n&gt; enough not to want to go where he is not valued and<br/>\n&gt; treated well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can be attached to 20 sets of grandparents, or<br/>\n&gt; you can have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with<br/>\n&gt; but you know love<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How do you know they love you if they never treat<br/>\n&gt; you like they do? I  <br/>\n&gt; recently read &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot;<br/>\n&gt; because it was  <br/>\n&gt; being discussed on AlwaysUnschooled. According to<br/>\n&gt; the authors, there  <br/>\n&gt; are five &quot;love languages&quot;: gifts, acts of service,<br/>\n&gt; quality time,  <br/>\n&gt; physical touch, and words of affirmation. Amazingly,<br/>\n&gt; my parents  <br/>\n&gt; managed not to speak any of them, while maintaining<br/>\n&gt; a facade that we  <br/>\n&gt; were a successful, happy family. I do suspect they<br/>\n&gt; love me, or think  <br/>\n&gt; they do, but it is a lot to ask of a child that she<br/>\n&gt; &quot;know her  <br/>\n&gt; grandparents love her&quot; and accept them for who they<br/>\n&gt; are when they are  <br/>\n&gt; not showing love in any meaningful way and do not<br/>\n&gt; accept her for who  <br/>\n&gt; she is. I am in my 40s and only just getting the<br/>\n&gt; hang of this with my  <br/>\n&gt; parents, as I develop more compassion for them and<br/>\n&gt; their own  <br/>\n&gt; childhoods--if you look at the families they came<br/>\n&gt; from, full of  <br/>\n&gt; alcoholism and violence, my parents are miracles for<br/>\n&gt; not passing  <br/>\n&gt; those dysfunctions on. But they still fell far short<br/>\n&gt; of giving me and  <br/>\n&gt; my brother the love and affirmation children need to<br/>\n&gt; thrive, and, as  <br/>\n&gt; grandparents, they are materially generous but cold<br/>\n&gt; and not  <br/>\n&gt; affectionate.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Su<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   Vanessa  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!

We invited them to<br/>\nschool stuff, when both kids were in ps, and I ended<br/>\nup trying to explain that they couldn&#39;t come, when all<br/>\nI knew was that they were either off to their other<br/>\ngrandson&#39;s concerts, which was after my childrens<br/>\nconcerts, or they just plain didn&#39;t want to go.  After<br/>\ndiscussing this with my dh, we decided to stop<br/>\ninviting them, because there was always an &quot;excuse&quot; to<br/>\nwhy they couldn&#39;t come.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have also noticed that at family functions,<br/>\nthey are always paying attention to everyone else&#39;s<br/>\nkids, but never them.  This hurts them, and they don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why.  There are only 3 grandkids in dh&#39;s<br/>\nfamily, two of them belong to us.  My son just told me<br/>\nthat he would rather not see his grandparents here,<br/>\nbecause everytime a baby comes around, that doesn&#39;t<br/>\nbelong to the family, his grandparents treat him like<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t exist, and just pays attention to the baby.<br/>\n They have always done this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do make sure to tell them that their grandparents<br/>\nlove them, and I have no problem with my husband<br/>\ntaking them over there to visit, but plain and simple,<br/>\nthe kids just don&#39;t want to go.  I don&#39;t feel that<br/>\nit&#39;s a good thing to force them, because it would do<br/>\nmore harm than good.  I also don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>\nthem being attached to both sets of grandparents. <br/>\nThere is no bond/connection with the set that lives<br/>\nnear us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are just as happy not to see them.  The<br/>\nfact that they are attached to my parents is not a<br/>\ncontest.  It never was.  My parents do things with<br/>\nthem, call them long distance, send them letters, and<br/>\npictures.  The ones that live here, don&#39;t know my<br/>\nkids, and have never taken the chance to get to know<br/>\nthem.  I have been put in situations with my dad&#39;s<br/>\nparents, and was forced to go for visits with them. <br/>\nIt backfired and in a bad way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children deserve to be happy, and feel loved and<br/>\nsafe.  They don&#39;t get those feelings from my in-laws. <br/>\nI feel bad for my kids and my dh&#39;s parents, because<br/>\nthey are missing out on two really good kids.  I can<br/>\nonly get them to agree to see their grandparents once<br/>\na month at breakfast, if even that.  I can&#39;t help the<br/>\nway their grandparents here treat them.  They are not<br/>\nthe traditional kind of grandparents, and don&#39;t really<br/>\nhave much time to spare to spend with my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a nasty evil daughter in law.  I don&#39;t get<br/>\nalong with my in-laws, and they aren&#39;t allowed at my<br/>\nhouse while I am home, but I have never stopped them<br/>\nfrom seeing my kids.  They can call them any time they<br/>\nwant, but they choose not to.  They could ask for my<br/>\ndh to take them over for a visit, but they don&#39;t. <br/>\nNone of this is my fault.  It is their&#39;s for not<br/>\nmaking any effort to see their grandkids, and to get<br/>\nto know them.  My kids have told me that when they<br/>\nvisit over there, their grandparents don&#39;t really talk<br/>\nto them, and talk to my dh instead.  I guess sometimes<br/>\nthey should stop and think about how that would make<br/>\nthem feel, especially since my kids tell me how much<br/>\nin bothers them.  Talking to them doesn&#39;t help, they<br/>\njust don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- Kathleen Gehrke &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gehrkes@...\">gehrkes@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Vanessa&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;psychomom95@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Sorry to bother you guys again, but we had another<br/>\n&gt; issue about my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids seeing their grandparents (dh&#39;s parents) this<br/>\n&gt; weekend.<br/>\n&gt; Vanessa,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I am a bit confused why they would not want<br/>\n&gt; to see their <br/>\n&gt; grandparents?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; DH asked the kids if they wanted to do breakfast<br/>\n&gt; with his parents <br/>\n&gt; &gt; this weekend.  DS said yes, only to make dh happy.<br/>\n&gt;  Dd didn&#39;t want <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to, because she doesn&#39;t want to see them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; How far away do these folks live?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; On Sunday they woke up, and ate breakfast here. <br/>\n&gt; Dh woke up really <br/>\n&gt; &gt; grouchy, and was upset that they ate here, instead<br/>\n&gt; of wanting to <br/>\n&gt; go <br/>\n&gt; &gt; out to breakfast with him and his parents.  (It<br/>\n&gt; was after 11:00 <br/>\n&gt; a.m. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; when he left for breakfast.)  The kids are used to<br/>\n&gt; eating after <br/>\n&gt; they <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get up, which has been around 9.  So to wait until<br/>\n&gt; 11 is too long <br/>\n&gt; for <br/>\n&gt; &gt; them to eat after they get up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids will sometimes have two breakfasts before<br/>\n&gt; noon, also it <br/>\n&gt; sounds like a visit time more than a meal time?<br/>\n&gt; Maybe I am still <br/>\n&gt; confused.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Problem remains, that my kids don&#39;t want to see<br/>\n&gt; their grandparents <br/>\n&gt; &gt; here, and dh keeps trying to push them into it,<br/>\n&gt; even though he <br/>\n&gt; &gt; promised he wouldn&#39;t.  My kids are attached to my<br/>\n&gt; parents, who <br/>\n&gt; live <br/>\n&gt; &gt; 550 miles away, and would rather see them. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can be attached to 20 sets of grandparents, or<br/>\n&gt; you can have <br/>\n&gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with<br/>\n&gt; but you know love <br/>\n&gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  How do we handle this, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and let dh know in a nice way, that he shouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; push, and when <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids are ready they will let him know?  I know it<br/>\n&gt; hurts him, but <br/>\n&gt; his <br/>\n&gt; &gt; parents alienated my kids long ago, when they were<br/>\n&gt; out of the cute <br/>\n&gt; &gt; baby stages.  They are now almost 10 and 11, and<br/>\n&gt; can make some of <br/>\n&gt; &gt; those decisions on their own.  Dh never had a<br/>\n&gt; relationship with <br/>\n&gt; his <br/>\n&gt; &gt; grandparents, so he understands, but never accepts<br/>\n&gt; that his <br/>\n&gt; parents <br/>\n&gt; &gt; did this to themselves.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; First I need to say I am a grandma. My fourth<br/>\n&gt; grandaughter is due to <br/>\n&gt; arrive next week. As much as you love your kids, you<br/>\n&gt; love your <br/>\n&gt; grandkids and you do not have the same ability and<br/>\n&gt; access to your <br/>\n&gt; grandchildren, especially if they are your sons<br/>\n&gt; children.I know that <br/>\n&gt; sounds sexist, but truly it is not.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Both of my dil are beautiful girls whom I completely<br/>\n&gt; love. They let <br/>\n&gt; me love their children. They generously share them<br/>\n&gt; with me and love <br/>\n&gt; me despite my faults.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest sons first wife did not like me. She hated<br/>\n&gt; me and after <br/>\n&gt; she divorced my son she made it almost impossible to<br/>\n&gt; access my <br/>\n&gt; grandaughter. It broke my heart. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of my children are also adopted and we see<br/>\n&gt; there birth <br/>\n&gt; families. As far as I can tell you cannot have to<br/>\n&gt; many people that <br/>\n&gt; love you.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My kids birthfamilies are not folks that I might<br/>\n&gt; choose to be <br/>\n&gt; friends with if we did not share children. But they<br/>\n&gt; are my kids <br/>\n&gt; birthfamilies and because I love my kids I make them<br/>\n&gt; comfortable and <br/>\n&gt; I treat them with respect and kindness. They are my<br/>\n&gt; family. I also <br/>\n&gt; set boundaries with the ones who are less<br/>\n&gt; appropriate so my kids <br/>\n&gt; feel safe and can appreciate the contact. Like we<br/>\n&gt; meet in neutral <br/>\n&gt; places and have timelines on the visit and code<br/>\n&gt; words so if they are <br/>\n&gt; to uncomfortable we can leave. However during a<br/>\n&gt; visit I work very <br/>\n&gt; hard to make sure my child and this birthfamily<br/>\n&gt; member are engaging <br/>\n&gt; in positive interactions so my kids will feel good<br/>\n&gt; about the contact.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday former dil called and asked if I wanted to<br/>\n&gt; see <br/>\n&gt; grandaughter.  She lives 21 hours away and it is a<br/>\n&gt; rarity to have <br/>\n&gt; any access.I said I would love that. They spent six<br/>\n&gt; hours at my <br/>\n&gt; house, former dil and grandaughter. I fed them,<br/>\n&gt; chatted and chose to <br/>\n&gt; practice kindness and tolerance despite that fact<br/>\n&gt; that this girl <br/>\n&gt; devistated my son and has done some very cruel<br/>\n&gt; things to my family, <br/>\n&gt; includinng malicious untruths about me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She is the mother of my grandaughter, therefore she<br/>\n&gt; is also my <br/>\n&gt; family. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know there are situation where family needs to<br/>\n&gt; have boundaries <br/>\n&gt; set. Where hurts need to heal, but communication and<br/>\n&gt; kindness can <br/>\n&gt; bridge many gaps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am sorry your family is split and hurting over<br/>\n&gt; this.

My  <br/>\nolder son doesn&#39;t much care to see my parents because my parents are  <br/>\nnot very affectionate. My father doesn&#39;t know how to give my older  <br/>\nson Eric, who is six, time to warm up when we first arrive at their  <br/>\nhouse, but immediately wants Eric to, say, hug, him. This has been  <br/>\nthe pattern since Eric was 2 or so:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad: Give grandpa a hug!<br/>\n<br/>\nEric stands quietly.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad: Give me a hug!<br/>\n<br/>\nEric scoots closer to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad, yelling: ERIC! COME GIVE GRANDPA A HUG!<br/>\n<br/>\nEric gets into my lap and stays there for an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarl, 3, is much quicker to warm up, and has a more outgoing  <br/>\npersonality. In the last year, when we visit, my mother doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nbother to hide her preference for Carl over Eric.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy whole life, my parents treated me badly because I wasn&#39;t what they  <br/>\nwanted in a daughter. Now they are increasingly indifferent to my  <br/>\nkids, Eric especially, because he doesn&#39;t seem to fit some  <br/>\npreconceived notion they have about what a grandson should be like.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of my parents is able to think of others, and put someone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s feelings ahead of their own. Not even small children&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy wouldn&#39;t a kid want to see his grandparents? Because he&#39;s smart  <br/>\nenough not to want to go where he is not valued and treated well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be attached to 20 sets of grandparents, or you can have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; grandparents that you are not always thrilled with but you know love<br/>\n&gt; you and are just who they are.It is not a contest.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you know they love you if they never treat you like they do? I  <br/>\nrecently read &quot;The Five Love Languages for Children&quot; because it was  <br/>\nbeing discussed on AlwaysUnschooled. According to the authors, there  <br/>\nare five &quot;love languages&quot;: gifts, acts of service, quality time,  <br/>\nphysical touch, and words of affirmation. Amazingly, my parents  <br/>\nmanaged not to speak any of them, while maintaining a facade that we  <br/>\nwere a successful, happy family. I do suspect they love me, or think  <br/>\nthey do, but it is a lot to ask of a child that she &quot;know her  <br/>\ngrandparents love her&quot; and accept them for who they are when they are  <br/>\nnot showing love in any meaningful way and do not accept her for who  <br/>\nshe is. I am in my 40s and only just getting the hang of this with my  <br/>\nparents, as I develop more compassion for them and their own  <br/>\nchildhoods--if you look at the families they came from, full of  <br/>\nalcoholism and violence, my parents are miracles for not passing  <br/>\nthose dysfunctions on. But they still fell far short of giving me and  <br/>\nmy brother the love and affirmation children need to thrive, and, as  <br/>\ngrandparents, they are materially generous but cold and not  <br/>\naffectionate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Another grandparent issue","postDate":"1180445519","msgId":24104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzaGEwZituZ3J2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYzaDQ2Mit1cDM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24102,"nextInTopic":24106,"prevInTime":24103,"nextInTime":24105,"topicId":24102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
