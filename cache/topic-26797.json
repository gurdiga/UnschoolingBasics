Not to  <br/>\nget her advice on things, she doesn&#39;t seem to live in the same world  <br/>\nwe do &lt;G&gt;, but because it was such a wonderful source of material for  <br/>\ninteresting discussions.

Anyway, one thing I have to say for her, she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t hesitate to address sexuality very directly - I used to teach  <br/>\nat USC when she was also teaching there. I taught economics in the  <br/>\nroom next door to where she was teaching a human sexuality course  <br/>\n(her degree is in anatomy and physiology). I used to stand in the  <br/>\ndoorway in the back of her room and listen. She was so direct and  <br/>\nclear - I&#39;m sure it was the first time most of those college students  <br/>\nhad heard anyone talk so openly about sexuality. Anyway - not that  <br/>\nI&#39;m generally a fan of hers - but maybe turning on her radio shows  <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re driving in the car is a way to open up a lot of subjects  <br/>\n- makes it a lot more comfortable when you&#39;re talking about someone  <br/>\nelse&#39;s situation - some stranger who called a radio program.

I&#39;m needing to do my shopping online, so titles, Please! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  We have a copy of &quot;What&#39;s Happening to My Body? for boys&quot; -- which Will (22 now) read a lot, and a newer copy for Andy (who doesn&#39;t read much except manga books, wonder if there&#39;s manga sex ed book out there...) Actually, Andy&#39;s a kid who&#39;s never had a thought he didn&#39;t share, so he and I talk about sex very openly.  Dan (6) is much more modest, but since he&#39;s around, he hears the sex questions Andy shares, so he doesn&#39;t have to ask directly. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nPinpoint customers who are looking for what you sell. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] on the subject of sex....","postDate":"1191690458","msgId":26799,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcxMDA2MTAwN3Y0OGQyZGQ4NGs3ZjY2MGY5NDhjZWI4OWQ1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZlOGVsZytrazk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZlOGVsZytrazk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26797,"nextInTopic":26800,"prevInTime":26798,"nextInTime":26800,"topicId":26797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You didn t ask me, and this may be more than your boy can handle, but Monty Python s Meaning of Life has a lot of discussion about sex including a scene where","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-592503219\">You didn&#39;t ask me, and this may be more than your boy can handle, but Monty<br/>\nPython&#39;s Meaning of Life has a lot of discussion about sex including a scene<br/>\nwhere they are teaching it in a stuffy Catholic boys&#39; school.
