But *always*, regardless of age, regardless of behavior, it&#39;s  <br/>\nhelpful for the relationship to see that the child is trying to meet a  <br/>\nneed. It&#39;s also helpful for the relationship to see kids as wanting to  <br/>\nbe good but they just don&#39;t know how. They don&#39;t choose hurtful  <br/>\nselfish solutions because they&#39;re &quot;bad&quot; but because the polite route  <br/>\nis often more complex and heads away from what they want and isn&#39;t a  <br/>\nsure thing. So they choose the direct route. They&#39;re choosing what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re able to figure out. Their actions aren&#39;t saying they&#39;re bad.  <br/>\nTheir actions are saying they need help figuring out an indirect  <br/>\nsolution that will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once likened it a kids sitting across a chasm from what they want.  <br/>\nMom tells them they&#39;re not allowed to jump. She often tells them to  <br/>\ntake or helps them take the long, indirect route but it involves a  <br/>\ncomplex path that twists away from what they want. And the thing is  <br/>\nright there across the chasm. So they jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t jump because they&#39;re bad.  Even if you think they should  <br/>\nknow by now not to jump, they&#39;re still jumping because -- as their  <br/>\nactions say loud and clear -- they still need help navigating the more  <br/>\ncomplex path.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that unschoolers never say no. It&#39;s that no isn&#39;t helpful. It  <br/>\nfocuses on the mom&#39;s agenda, like how hitting is bad, and not on the  <br/>\nchild&#39;s agenda. As you know, when someone is focused on something else  <br/>\nit&#39;s the worst possible time to expect them to hear about something  <br/>\nelse! Yes, they should hear -- at least once ;-) -- I can&#39;t let you  <br/>\nhit your sister. But after a couple of times they know! It&#39;s not the  <br/>\nwords that are confounding them. It&#39;s how to meet their need in a  <br/>\nbetter way that&#39;s confounding them. So you help them with a better  <br/>\nway.

Let me start by saying i am a nonspanking attachment parent that cosleeps, babywears, cloth diapers,etc. In researching unschooling I have found it runs hand in hand with attachment parenting and gentle parenting/natural child beliefs.  My question is in reading about natural child beliefs I have come accross the philosophy that all forms of punishment are bad and that telling a child no is bad.  I can understand the reasoning behind this.  I can definatly see why it would be better to say yes as often as possible.  But I have been a parent for 11 years, a Foster parent of and on for 17 yard, worked in daycare centers, public s hooks and even owned my own day care.  All that working with children has taught me several things 1) children can and do learn without any adult involvement 2) children go through cases some they grow<br/>\n out of some they dont and 3) something may be age appropriate but they still need an adult to teach them why a behavior is unacceptable and how to refrain from doing it.  So I guess what I m getting at is from my experience a child that hits a age 2 (perfectly normal) if not taught its wrong will hit at 5(still normal but less acceptable ) and at 10(no longer acceptable) and a 30(jail time).  Can any of you explain how this wonderful sounding philosophy works in real life.  Because from my experience with children I seems to me that raising my children like that would simply cause everyone else in our house to be miserable.  Or am I missing something here?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44007,"nextTopicId":43893}}
