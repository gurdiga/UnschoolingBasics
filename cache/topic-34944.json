I was, let&#39;s say, attracted to the ideas of unschooling. I  <br/>\naccepted them readily. But the entire &quot;attentive parenting&quot; aspect of  <br/>\nit did not even sink in to me until I spent a half-hour or so in a car  <br/>\nwith Sandra and her daughter, Holly. Holly was 6, I think. And, since  <br/>\nthen, every single time I spend time with unschoolers who have chosent  <br/>\nto thoroughly live a holistic unschooling lifestyle, I am inspired  <br/>\nagain and my own parenting is always notched up another level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra said, in a conference talk, to not be afraid to think dangerous  <br/>\nthoughts - that just thinking them wasn&#39;t going to make anything  <br/>\nactually happen. She suggested being brave and maybe duct-taping  <br/>\nourselves into a chair, get someone to spot us. and let ourselves  <br/>\nthink freely &lt;g&gt;. I felt a shiver go through me when I heard those  <br/>\nwords - &quot;think dangerous thoughts?&quot; Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I did that (well, minus the duct-tape and the spotter, but I got  <br/>\nher point). It was an actual challenge to LET myself imagine - to  <br/>\nhonestly say, &quot;Well, what IF I don&#39;t teach my kid to read?&quot; &quot;What IF I  <br/>\nnever make her take a shower?&quot; &quot;What if she eats nothing but potato  <br/>\nchips for the next ten years?&quot; Sitting down with the purpose of  <br/>\nletting myself really analyze and examine &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; was  <br/>\nextraordinarily liberating and empowering. I highly recommend it. I  <br/>\nhad to MAKE my brain do it - encountered a lot of resistance in  <br/>\nmyself. Lots of fear and lots of conventional thinking that did NOT  <br/>\nwant to be dislodged. I forced myself to notice which thoughts most  <br/>\ndisturbed me and I wrenched my brain into looking at them. I could  <br/>\ntell when I was defending my old thoughts and I actively pushed those  <br/>\ndefensive thoughts aside - just for the moment, remember, while I was  <br/>\nengaged in &quot;thinking dangerous thoughts.&quot; I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay, you can  <br/>\nstill think THAT when you&#39;re all done with this, but for now, what if  <br/>\nthe truth is that .....&quot; and I&#39;d fill in something that seemed risky  <br/>\nto me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend this attitude be adopted when reading the various  <br/>\nradical unschooling lists. If something hurts, scares, offends, or  <br/>\notherwise disturbs you - then look harder at it and just pretend, for  <br/>\nthe moment, that the other person knows what they are talking about -  <br/>\ntemporarily grant them credibility and consider their ideas seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can always walk away and go back to your old thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195592821,"authorName":"Robert Saxon","from":"&quot;Robert Saxon&quot; &lt;TheSaxons@...&gt;","profile":"rob_saxon_2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: about this group","postDate":"1217539681","msgId":34996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDgwNzMxMTQyOGgxYzlkY2Y5MXNhYzNiN2YxNzk0N2I0OTY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwNzMxMTMzMng1YmM1ZDZhN3FkZGU5Zjc5NWM5ZmEyNjZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XMzE5OTEyOUM1NEMwQ0I5MDBERjgwMkFEN0QwQHBoeC5nYmw+CSA8OENBQzA3MUMzRTI1NzExLUM0OC0xODQzQFdFQk1BSUwtTUMwMi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4JIDwzYTkzZmZmMTA4MDczMTEzMzJ4NWJjNWQ2YTdxZGRlOWY3OTVjOWZhMjY2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34995,"nextInTopic":34997,"prevInTime":34995,"nextInTime":34997,"topicId":34944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And part of what keeps that newbie guitar player practicing is (a) getting better, and (b) continually envisioning how it s going to be.

Like guitar playing.  It sucks to jam<br/>\nwith players who are CONFIDENT and really know what they&#39;re doing while<br/>\nyou&#39;re fumbling around with badly executed muddy-sounding chords.<br/>\nObservation helps.  Trying what they&#39;re doing helps.  Keep on keeping on.<br/>\nComplaining doesn&#39;t help much of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo learn anything new and get good at it, stick around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a newbie asks a seasoned guitar player to support their fumblings by<br/>\npretending it&#39;s still hard for them (which is probably true at times but not<br/>\nmost times) .... just to help them feel better about how themselves, how<br/>\ndoes it help them learn more about unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nStick with it to understand and truly live wholelife unschooling.

It works in a more supportive manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way to make emails lists be something they aren&#39;t. There<br/>\nARE different flavors to lists for sure, but the most busy and<br/>\ninteresting are often somewhat direct at times. Some of the &quot;nice&quot;<br/>\nlists I&#39;ve dropped by are all in discussions about anything BUT<br/>\nunschooling. Which is  waste of time for those that want to be on-topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a new place for unschoolers that you (and others) may really<br/>\nenjoy. It FEELS more supportive in many ways, partly because you make<br/>\na profile with your picture and there&#39;s more of a human connection<br/>\njust by having those pics!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy good friend Laura started it and I highly encourage you to check it<br/>\nout.

I have been a member for two years now and I have learned a LOT! Our life has become very loving, free and happy and a lot has to do with this group. I do consider myself a  radical unschooler but I realize there are still some areas where I am unclear or unsure about what to do. Then I like a clear and truthful answer. After meeting some of you in person (Ren, Kelly....) I know those are people I would love to have as neighbors, friends or family.<br/>\nAbout the Legos:  A while ago I organized the Legos roughly by size, but they got mixed up a lot. Then one day my then 5 or 6 y.o. son suggested to organize them by color instead, just like in the Lego store. We dumped all the Legos in a huge pile on the floor, counted how many colors we have, how many bins we need, which colors got the large and which got the smaller bins. We spend about two days doing this on and off, with my son reminding me to please can we keep sorting the Legos. He will still say to me sometimes, remember how much fun it was sorting the Legos?<br/>\nHe also thinks it is a lot of fun cleaning beaches. He has been asking me for a while now to do that one again. Pack up some trash bags and head to the beach - we once filled two black trash bags at one beach. He is horrified as to how people can do this. And yes, it was all his idea. He might have gotten it from somewhere (Curious George? Nature Channel?) of course. <br/>\n<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Adrean Clark &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:adreanaline@...\">adreanaline@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 30, 2008 10:05:39 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] about this group<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look in the archives for &quot;learning-takes&quot; you&#39;ll find some<br/>\npeople who have lost their temper and the responses that have helped<br/>\n;).

There are 20 coaches with different <br/>\nbackgrounds and different coaching styles. But rather than pair you up <br/>\nwith ONE coach, you get the benefit of all 20. Some rub you the wrong <br/>\nway. Some push too hard. Some are so sweet that they can&#39;t get you to <br/>\ndo anything. Some are coming from so far out of left field, you don&#39;t <br/>\neven know what they&#39;re asking of you. Some speak with such a heavy <br/>\naccent, you can&#39;t even make out the directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ALL are *there* for *you*! They all want *you* to bring home the <br/>\ngold. They each have a style that worked for them---and probably works <br/>\nfor many others. You may jive with 15 or 16, but four or five of them <br/>\njust drive you MAD. It&#39;s not that those four or five are bad <br/>\ncoaches----or that they have nothing to offer you. It&#39;s just that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t work with your way of learning. Luckily, you have 15 others to <br/>\nrely on, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I have been thinking about lately is that it would be helpful <br/>\nto me as<br/>\na newbie to know that veterans *were* at some point struggling with <br/>\nspecific<br/>\nthings and to talk about that journey. It can be inspirational to hear <br/>\nhow<br/>\nsomeone was once where you are now and what they did to get to where <br/>\n*they* are<br/>\nnow (and possibly how long it took). I know that everyone is different <br/>\nbut for<br/>\nme at least, I love to make connections with people who have similar <br/>\nstories and<br/>\ngain strength from them to do the hard work and move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, we *all* have only our own stories to share (although I often <br/>\ntell Joyce&#39;s story about spilled milk because it made such an <br/>\nimpression on ME!). Most of us shy away from concepts where we have <br/>\nlittle to no experience (sibling rivalry is one I&#39;m clueless on, other <br/>\nthan my own crappy childhood with my brother---and why I purposefully <br/>\ndon&#39;t have children close in age).<br/>\n<br/>\nOur responses have a basis in experience: we&#39;ve DONE those things we <br/>\nsuggest---and we suggest them because they worked for us!<br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend going back and reading the archives here. (Even <br/>\nbetter: go back and read the archives at UnschoolingDiscussion (which <br/>\nwas Unschoolingdotcom a long time ago) and unschooling.com message <br/>\nboards. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know how much of the archives are <br/>\navailable there---Pam and Joyce might know though. They&#39;re list <br/>\nowners). Ren and I started unschooling just a few months apart. I was <br/>\nalready on board when she came on spitting and fuming over certain <br/>\nthings. I thought, &quot;Lord, she will *never* get this! Why is the world <br/>\nis she bothering?&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI rarely posted---well, not until I really and truly understood it. <br/>\nRen&#39;s journey was documented in black and white. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the REALLY good archives are the ones on which someone is <br/>\nstruggling sooo hard, but just can&#39;t quite grasp it. She&#39;s asking and <br/>\npondering and trying things out, and the old farts are coaching her <br/>\nthrough it, challenging and pushing and questioning back. The newbie <br/>\nmay even go away for a bit. But comes back a few weeks later with more <br/>\nquestions and concerns. She may storm off this time, frustrated and <br/>\ninfuriated, but she comes back a few months later, saying, &quot;You know, <br/>\nsome of this seems to be working. Our home is more peaceful, the kids <br/>\nseem to *like* me, and we aren&#39;t fighting about all those little <br/>\nthings! Now...what about *this*!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone suggested to read a few posts and come back later---that&#39;s <br/>\ngood. But even better might be to go back to a point *before* you were <br/>\never on this list and read similar questions/concerns. Because they&#39;ve <br/>\nall been answered so many times before---they&#39;re there. You just have <br/>\nto look. But going back and reading what others have written when it&#39;s <br/>\nNOT personal to *you*, it&#39;s easier to be objective. When the answers <br/>\nare to *your* specific question, it&#39;s hard NOT to take it personally. <br/>\nReading accounts of a similar problem---where you have no stake---it&#39;s <br/>\neasier to see the answers/advice in a more positive light.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to the original suggestion: &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may certainly ASK about a specific situation. I&#39;ve written LOADS <br/>\nabout how we were very traditional and conservative parents. Cameron <br/>\nwas in private school until the end of sixth grade. This was NOT <br/>\nnatural for us. It took a LOT of work.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since I *have* written so extensively (and I don&#39;t keep a file of <br/>\nall I&#39;ve written), I get tired of writing the same things over and <br/>\nover. I mean---really, you *can* go back into the archives. My life is <br/>\npretty well laid out there! &lt;G&gt; Others here too! Joyce has a brilliant <br/>\nsite full of things she;s written. Sandra also has an extensive site <br/>\nchocked full of her---and OTHERS&#39;---stories about coming to <br/>\nunschooliing. No secrets. &lt;G&gt;  Our histories are pretty well <br/>\ndocumented. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso FWIW, I have felt very supported here but I have in the past felt <br/>\nsimilarly<br/>\nto some of the posters in this topic. I think my advice to other <br/>\nnewbies like<br/>\nmyself is to stay here and try to figure out *why* a post in particular <br/>\nwould<br/>\nmake you feel upset and never take it personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause no one *knows* you! None of us know how you are at home. We <br/>\nonly have what *you* are giving us to work with. And we all use our own <br/>\nexperiences to explain what we have done in similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften the things we react most vehemently against are the things we <br/>\nmost need to work on. If a post really disturbs you: take a minute, <br/>\nbreathe, and think about *why* it bothers you so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\nSee what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":281851436,"authorName":"hema a b","from":"&quot;hema a b&quot; &lt;hbonda@...&gt;","profile":"hbonda","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: about this group","postDate":"1217432024","msgId":34974,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc2cTFrbytkY25mQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XMzE5OTEyOUM1NEMwQ0I5MDBERjgwMkFEN0QwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":34970,"nextInTopic":34975,"prevInTime":34973,"nextInTime":34975,"topicId":34944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to the folks who took time with my post.

I hooked up with <br/>\nanother dissatisfied newbie unschooler and we started our own kinder, <br/>\ngentler unschooling support group.  It didn&#39;t work out the way we <br/>\nexpected.  At first, we mostly discussed how attacked we felt on the <br/>\nmore popular lists, this one included.  Once we got past that, the <br/>\ngroup just didn&#39;t really help me toward unschooling.  Instead, we <br/>\ncoddled one another on the areas where we were having trouble.  We <br/>\njustified our excuses for not being able to truly unschool all areas <br/>\nof life.  Rather than learning how to confront those monsters that <br/>\nkept us at bay from living freely, we stayed in the safe place.  I <br/>\nlearned that safe place isn&#39;t where I want to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took the seasoned unschoolers advice and learned to look at the <br/>\nposts on a non-personal level.  I no longer think the posts are <br/>\naggressive.  The style here is assertive and confident.  Sometimes I <br/>\ndo disagree with what someone says.  And that&#39;s okay because I can <br/>\nmull it over in my mind and try to figure out why I disagree so <br/>\nmuch.  I must say that when I really looked at the things that <br/>\nbothered me the most, those were the things that were really keeping <br/>\nme from living freely and joyfully.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m generally not the type of person that responds well to assertive <br/>\ntechniques.  I have shed many a tear thinking people just didn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand me.  But in truth, they did and do understand.  It&#39;s taken <br/>\nme years to grow and become more assertive and confident in myself.  <br/>\nThis is exactly why I think unschooling is so great for my children.  <br/>\nIf I hold onto the arbitrary rules and beliefs that didn&#39;t make me <br/>\nhappy, then I wasn&#39;t allowing my children to be happy either.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that may help is to space out the posts a bit.  If you ask <br/>\na question or participate in a discussion, don&#39;t read all the <br/>\nresponses at one time.  Read 1 or 2 and think about them before <br/>\nreading more or responding.  Maybe even journal your thoughts so you <br/>\ncan go back and physically view what your mind is processing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, when I really started actively looking into my thought <br/>\nprocesses, I saw that I was feeling disrespected.  I felt like all <br/>\nthe housework was on my shoulders.  I felt like all the child care <br/>\nresponsibility was mine.  I felt like I had to be someone different <br/>\nto please my husband.  But all of those were distorted perceptions.  <br/>\nMy children didn&#39;t make messes to make me miserable.  They were just <br/>\ntrying to be happy.  They didn&#39;t want to stay up late because they <br/>\nwanted to affect my sleep.  I was too personally involved in <br/>\neverything.  Once I really learned to step back and not look at <br/>\neverything in my life as something done personally to me, I was able <br/>\nto readjust my thinking.  And it&#39;s been like a floodgate lifted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m rambling on too much now.  I really do understand where you <br/>\nare coming from.  I came to unschooling in stages, over the last 4 <br/>\nyears.  I say we&#39;re unschoolers but I&#39;m still not exactly where I <br/>\nwant to be.  I&#39;m still learning each day along with my children.  It <br/>\nhas helped me to understand that the concept of unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>\nreally about my children at all.  It&#39;s about changing what I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking and how I live.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238615405,"authorName":"Kelli Johnston","from":"Kelli Johnston &lt;KelliJohnston@...&gt;","profile":"kaipelesmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: about this group","postDate":"1217428711","msgId":34964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XMzE5OTEyOUM1NEMwQ0I5MDBERjgwMkFEN0QwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":34963,"nextInTopic":34965,"prevInTime":34963,"nextInTime":34965,"topicId":34944,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Kelly, you know, at first I was really annoyed by the tone of this list but I have been coming around.

Bharadwaj &lt;hbonda@...&gt;I always thought this is something all of you want to do... and am surprisedthat it keeps you away from your families. why would you do that?-=-=-=-=-It *is* something we want to do . That&#39;s why we do it. &lt;g&gt; Remember: we each get to *choose* how we spend our time! &lt;g&gt;But do you really think running a list this active (and it&#39;s been pretty quiet lately---summer) does NOT take time?I usually read throughout the day and write in the mornings when my son is still asleep (of course he&#39;s sleeping until 5:00PM lately, so my day has opened up a lot. &lt;g&gt;). But writing nevertheless is taking time away from *something*---cleaning, gardening, the dog, the bees,...something. I try really hard not to have it interfere with the time with my husband and children. It does sometimes though---when things get busy.-=-=-=-=-I don&#39;t understand parts of your response. if its such a difficult thing tomaintain this list... then i&#39;m truly grateful but sad that what i take to bea natural extension of community is actually taking a toll on some of youmore experienced folks. Because naturally if you are doing this as aservice and have to respond to each query... then it will take a toll on you.-=-=-=-=-Yep. It takes its toll. If you read the archives, there will be times when we (Ren or I) will take a break from the list. It can get exhausting and frustrating. &quot;Coribell&quot; was frustrating---and a couple of her posts weren&#39;t even allowed through to the list. I SOOO love to help people who want to get it. I get SOOO tired of folks who just want to argue.Two of our best writers (moderators Deb and Rue) hardly ever write any more. It&#39;s unfortunate because they can get to the point SO well (and they&#39;re so very funny!). But they have lives too and would rather spend their time with their kids than answer emails that they&#39;ve answered a zillion times already.Don&#39;t think that any of these questions are new. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard a new concern or question is five or six years! Most we could answer in our sleep. Except that I don&#39;t sleep-type. &lt;G&gt;And I think folks need to understand that these lists are here for exactly as long as the owners and moderators *want* them to be. The day that it&#39;s not worth it for *us* any more, these lists will end.-=-=-=-=-=-What is cognitive dissonance?... i&#39;ll look it up. but i&#39;m not talking aboutfolks being defensive. i&#39;m talking about tone. and i think your emailexpresses different reasons for the abrupt nature of responses. I&#39;m notgoing &quot;off in a huff&quot;. I just believe that there may be a need for asupportive on-line group... some where i feel like hanging out and beingable to say... i lost my temper and it sucked. etc. i&#39;m not net savvy...and not sure if there is a diff name for such groups etc. I thought thisonline community helped newbies find a community to work with... perhaps ishould take the name &quot;unschooling basics&quot; literally? as in it only speaksof tenets and is not a place to rant, rave and ask for advice as well?-=-=-=-=-=-It&#39;s a place to ask questions and give advice about unschooling and mindful parenting. It is NOT a place to whine about how hard it is to rear children or to get pats on the back. We know how hard it can be---and we also know that there is a better way! It&#39;s also NOT a place to give advice that works *against the parent-child relationship or against unschooling.I know of no such group, but it&#39;s REALLY easy to start an online group through yahoo. *You* could do it. You could advertise here. Let folks know there is a &quot;support&quot; group for new unschoolers. People would come. But the chances that it would succeed are slim.Support groups don&#39;t help you be better. They support you where you *are*. I would say that it&#39;s *almost* impossible to get to unschooling without WORK. Without taking hard, tough looks at your-own-self to see where you are now and where you want to be. Without questioning yourself and pushing yourself past where you you&#39;re comfortable.It&#39;s NOT easy! It&#39;s about dumping loads of baggage. And it&#39;s hard to dump baggage when a crowd of others are saying, &quot;Here, let me help you carry that another mile or two.&quot; It&#39;s so much more helpful ---if you *WANT* to lose that baggage---for someone to say, &quot;Here, let&#39;s toss THAT one in the river. Oh---and let me kick THAT one down the hill!&quot;This list is NOT about toting Samsonite!But if you want to start one of those, go for it!-=-=-=-=-=-I did not realise that the age of the group and its consistency had much todo with success of the group.-=-=-=-=-=-Why not?-=-=-=-=-I feel if connections are made online then its successful.-=-=-=-=-=-You really may be looking for another type of group.Connections *are* made here. Some of my best friends in the world are from these lists! Virtual and In Real Life. But that&#39;s not the purpose of this list.-=-=-=-=-But then i may not be always looking for advice. more likea &#39;i&#39;ve been there and it gets better&#39; type of group.-=-=-=-=-The deal is: We have almost ALL &quot;been there&quot;---and because we&#39;re here offering our stories, you can SEE that it gets better. That is the message.But you don&#39;t &quot;get here&quot; by whining about how tough it is now and asking for pats on the back. You &quot;get *here*&quot; by DOING it and doing better each time.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a need for the kind of list you&#39;re interested in. Start one. But don&#39;t expect it to help you go further in your understanding of unschooling. More than likely, you will stagnate.

I speak of cleanliness only in terms of dust-build-up, not leaving<br/>\n&gt; food outside uncovered, washing up more often... so that sticky trails don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; attract the inevitable flies and ant-families etc... toys on the floor and<br/>\n&gt; cushions on top of the kitchen counter are not considered messy here :-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Also recently when i helped my son with re-organizing his humongous lego<br/>\n&gt; collection in color-based drawers.... he mentioned within a few days... that<br/>\n&gt; he thinks its a great way to be able to find what he is looking for asap.<br/>\n&gt; But he asked me to continue to help him stay on top of the chaos that ensues<br/>\n&gt; after a couple of days of lego-mania.  so nice to have found a solution and<br/>\n&gt; be able to help him with something that would drive us nuts... trying to<br/>\n&gt; find a compass needle in a lego-stack ;-)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Love and peace to all,<br/>\n&gt; Hema<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; Hema A.

That&#39;s why we do it. &lt;g&gt; Remember: we <br/>\neach get to *choose* how we spend our time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut do you really think running a list this active (and it&#39;s been <br/>\npretty quiet lately---summer) does NOT take time?<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually read throughout the day and write in the mornings when my son <br/>\nis still asleep (of course he&#39;s sleeping until 5:00PM lately, so my day <br/>\nhas opened up a lot. &lt;g&gt;). But writing nevertheless is taking time away <br/>\n from *something*---cleaning, gardening, the dog, the bees,...something. <br/>\nI try really hard not to have it interfere with the time with my <br/>\nhusband and children. It does sometimes though---when things get busy.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t understand parts of your response.  if its such a difficult <br/>\nthing to<br/>\nmaintain this list... then i&#39;m truly grateful but sad that what i take <br/>\nto be<br/>\na natural extension of community is actually taking a toll on some of <br/>\nyou<br/>\nmore experienced folks.  Because naturally if you are doing this as a<br/>\nservice and have to respond to each query... then it will take a toll <br/>\non you.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYep. It takes its toll. If you read the archives, there will be times <br/>\nwhen we (Ren or I) will take a break from the list. It can get <br/>\nexhausting and frustrating. &quot;Coribell&quot; was frustrating---and a couple <br/>\nof her posts weren&#39;t even allowed through to the list. I SOOO love to <br/>\nhelp people who want to get it. I get SOOO tired of folks who just want <br/>\nto argue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo of our best writers (moderators Deb and Rue) hardly ever write any <br/>\nmore. It&#39;s unfortunate because they can get to the point SO well (and <br/>\nthey&#39;re so very funny!). But they have lives too and would rather spend <br/>\ntheir time with their kids than answer emails that they&#39;ve answered a <br/>\nzillion times already.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t think that any of these questions are new. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve <br/>\nheard a new concern or question is five or six years! Most we could <br/>\nanswer in our sleep. Except that I don&#39;t sleep-type. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think folks need to understand that these lists are here for <br/>\nexactly as long as the owners and moderators *want* them to be. The day <br/>\nthat it&#39;s not worth it for *us* any more, these lists will end.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is cognitive dissonance?... i&#39;ll look it up.  but i&#39;m not talking <br/>\nabout<br/>\nfolks being defensive.  i&#39;m talking about tone.  and i think your email<br/>\nexpresses different reasons for the abrupt nature of responses.  I&#39;m not<br/>\ngoing &quot;off in a huff&quot;.  I just believe that there may be a need for a<br/>\nsupportive on-line group... some where i feel like hanging out and being<br/>\nable to say... i lost my temper and it sucked. etc.  i&#39;m not net <br/>\nsavvy...<br/>\nand not sure if there is a diff name for such groups etc. I thought this<br/>\nonline community helped newbies find a community to work with... <br/>\nperhaps i<br/>\nshould take the name &quot;unschooling basics&quot; literally?  as in it only <br/>\nspeaks<br/>\nof tenets and is not a place to rant, rave and ask for advice as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a place to ask questions and give advice about unschooling and <br/>\nmindful parenting. It is NOT a place to whine about how hard it is to <br/>\nrear children or to get pats on the back. We know how hard it can <br/>\nbe---and we also know that there is a better way! It&#39;s also NOT a place <br/>\nto give advice that works *against the parent-child relationship or <br/>\nagainst unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of no such group, but it&#39;s REALLY easy to start an online group <br/>\nthrough yahoo. *You* could do it. You could advertise here. Let folks <br/>\nknow there is a &quot;support&quot; group for new unschoolers. People would come. <br/>\nBut the chances that it would succeed are slim.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupport groups don&#39;t help you be better. They support you where you <br/>\n*are*. I would say that it&#39;s *almost* impossible to get to unschooling <br/>\nwithout WORK. Without taking hard, tough looks at your-own-self to see <br/>\nwhere you are now and where you want to be. Without questioning <br/>\nyourself and pushing yourself past where you you&#39;re comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s NOT easy! It&#39;s about dumping loads of baggage. And it&#39;s hard to <br/>\ndump baggage when a crowd of others are saying, &quot;Here, let me help you <br/>\ncarry that another mile or two.&quot; It&#39;s so much more helpful ---if you <br/>\n*WANT* to lose that baggage---for someone to say, &quot;Here, let&#39;s toss <br/>\nTHAT one in the river. Oh---and let me kick THAT one down the hill!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is NOT about toting Samsonite!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you want to start one of those, go for it!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not realise that the age of the group and its consistency had <br/>\nmuch to<br/>\ndo with success of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel if connections are made online then its successful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really may be looking for another type of group.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections *are* made here. Some of my best friends in the world are <br/>\n from these lists! Virtual and In Real Life. But that&#39;s not the purpose <br/>\nof this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then i may not be always looking for advice.  more like<br/>\na &#39;i&#39;ve been there and it gets better&#39; type of group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal is: We have almost ALL &quot;been there&quot;---and because we&#39;re here <br/>\noffering our stories, you can SEE that it gets better. That is the <br/>\nmessage.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you don&#39;t &quot;get here&quot; by whining about how tough it is now and <br/>\nasking for pats on the back. You &quot;get *here*&quot; by DOING it and doing <br/>\nbetter each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there&#39;s a need for the kind of list you&#39;re interested in. <br/>\nStart one. But don&#39;t expect it to help you go further in your <br/>\nunderstanding of unschooling. More than likely, you will stagnate.

Some people  <br/>\nunderstand the ideas right away, but I&#39;m betting very few people  <br/>\nfound this easy to put into practice. Letting go of control is hard!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral months ago this topic came up about the advantages of support  <br/>\nfor the struggle and the advantages of support to fix things. Someone  <br/>\nmentioned that she had joined a list for help with a chronic illness.  <br/>\nAt first the support felt good, but then she realized the support  <br/>\nbecame a trap. It was all about soothing the difficulty, people  <br/>\nsupporting each other in how hard life was. But it didn&#39;t help her  <br/>\nmove on. When there was so much support for the difficulties (and  <br/>\ncheering for small progress) there wasn&#39;t the push she needed to get  <br/>\noff her butt and do the hard work she needed to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone&#39;s having a hard time letting go posts with progress of the  <br/>\nform, &quot;This is hard, but I actually only made my kids do math today  <br/>\nbut I totally relaxed on the reading, yay me!&quot; are not going to get a  <br/>\nvery positive responses!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if someone posts &quot;This is hard!&quot; they&#39;ll probably get a chorus of  <br/>\n&quot;Yes, it is!&quot; It will then be followed by, &quot;Tell us about what you&#39;re  <br/>\nstruggling with and maybe people will come up with some ideas to help  <br/>\nmake it less difficult.&quot; The list isn&#39;t about support for how hard it  <br/>\nis because that&#39;s a trap. It&#39;s support for moving on from the hard  <br/>\nparts to get to the good parts :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Sandra Dodd recently said on the Unschooling Discussion list, that  <br/>\nlist (and this list) &quot;is for helping kids have better unschooling moms.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n*Our kids* need us to hear &quot;Yes, it&#39;s hard. Let&#39;s figure out how to  <br/>\nmake it easier *and* have better relationships right now with our  <br/>\nkids.&quot; We only have a few years with our kids. We don&#39;t have the  <br/>\nleisure to paddle about near the banks of the river seeking cheers  <br/>\nfor having moved another foot away from the edge. Our kids are out  <br/>\nthere riding the rapids to adulthood! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel the writing<br/>\n&gt; style sometimes is not one that would translate well into a real-life<br/>\n&gt; conversation between an always-unschooler and a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The big thing that&#39;s missing is tone of voice. Readers supply their  <br/>\nown tone and the tone they supply comes from the writer&#39;s word choice  <br/>\nand from the reader&#39;s past, *not* directly from the writer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone writes a gentle probing question trying to turn someone&#39;s  <br/>\nthinking around, like &quot;Why should she be interested in making her  <br/>\nbed?&quot; it *might *get heard by a reader (depends on the reader!) in an  <br/>\naccusatory tone because the reader has grown up with people who ask  <br/>\nquestions like that that really mean &quot;Are you an idiot?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three things readers can do:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst is read as though your best friend were speaking. Hear a tone  <br/>\nof loving support (even if the words are throwing you off.) Know that  <br/>\npeople *do* want to help!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, if you can&#39;t hear a gentle tone in a particular person&#39;s  <br/>\npost, skip them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, do a lot more reading. If it&#39;s hard to hear the advice  <br/>\ndirected to you, read in the archives and absorb the advice that was  <br/>\nwritten to someone else. It&#39;s often easier to be objective that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery person posting help on the list is someone who has said  <br/>\n&quot;Instead of doing x, I&#39;m going to take time from my life to answer  <br/>\nsome unschooling questions.&quot; They do it because they enjoy expressing  <br/>\ntheir ideas about unschooling in a certain way. It&#39;s a gift they&#39;re  <br/>\ngiving away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone loves knitting and they&#39;re churning out scarves and then  <br/>\nleaving them on their fence for people to take if they like them, it  <br/>\nwould be rude for a passerby to complain that someone used purple  <br/>\ninstead of orange! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone should take what they find that&#39;s useful to them and leave  <br/>\nthe rest. The rest will probably make more sense later as you get  <br/>\ncloser to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are there any unschooling-lists/groups for newbies where people are  <br/>\n&gt; less<br/>\n&gt; aggressive and more sensitive to people?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of people start them when they get upset with the tone of the  <br/>\ndiscussion lists! The ones I&#39;ve checked up on have puttered out. The  <br/>\nproblem is that the discussion lists are lively because people are  <br/>\npassionate about the subject they&#39;re writing about. They get fired up  <br/>\nto express what they love in a way that might help someone. It forces  <br/>\nthem to take time from their busy lives to sit down and pound out a  <br/>\nresponse.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to hold people&#39;s hands and say &quot;You&#39;re right, this is hard. The  <br/>\nsame thing is happening to me,&quot; is good for a while. It can feel like  <br/>\na breath of fresh air after the intensity of a discussion list! But  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t get writers fired up. After a while watching a rerun of a  <br/>\nTV show with the kids sounds better. After even longer doing the  <br/>\ndishes looks even better ;-) Support just doesn&#39;t rouse people&#39;s  <br/>\npassion the way discussion can unfortunately. :-/<br/>\n<br/>\nI do keep asking people if they find a supportive group, to come back  <br/>\nand post it. But they never do. Either they don&#39;t care. (Lack of  <br/>\npassion ;-) or they don&#39;t find them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best place for support is real life, I think, because besides the  <br/>\nsupport, people are getting that face to face social contact they  <br/>\ncrave. So they get something else out of it besides holding someone&#39;s  <br/>\nhand. Obviously that&#39;s really hard to get in some areas! Maybe people  <br/>\ncould post about how they find support -- even if it&#39;s in other ways  <br/>\nlike finding hobbies -- when physical groups aren&#39;t available.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":281851436,"authorName":"Hema A.

People who while enjoying the<br/>\nchange to unschooling..  still find things hard and are working on<br/>\nunschooling themselves?  aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go<br/>\nfor some... but some may want a gentler touch.  We still get the message...<br/>\nexcept its a gentler approach.  a group who accepts that each of us is<br/>\nalready trying hard and perhaps simply need acknowledgment and support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too find the more experienced unschoolers here a bit aggressive in their<br/>\nposting style.  perhaps i&#39;m a loner in this... but i find it hard to post<br/>\nissues here due to the lash-outs that happen at times.  we all want to get<br/>\n&#39;unschooling&#39; in its true glory. that is not in question. I feel the writing<br/>\nstyle sometimes is not one that would translate well into a real-life<br/>\nconversation between an always-unschooler and a newbie.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do admire the writing ability, word usage, experience, generosity of the<br/>\nmany members here.... i still want to be on-list... because i learn a lot.<br/>\nIts just that at times i wince when i see someone&#39;s struggle go<br/>\nunacknowledged... and instead they get the full-on-aggressive-advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFyi my partner and i have started unschooling truly only about 3 months ago<br/>\nand love how it has transformed our relationships with our 5 year old ds and<br/>\n2 year old dd.

I&#39;m still at a stage where my children are unable to appreciate a<br/>\nclean home... but living here in Pune, India... where the outside is dirty,<br/>\nill-maintained and fly ridden many a time.... a clean home is appreciated a<br/>\nlot more by my son these days.  He will say... he prefers our home to the<br/>\noutside.  I speak of cleanliness only in terms of dust-build-up, not leaving<br/>\nfood outside uncovered, washing up more often... so that sticky trails don&#39;t<br/>\nattract the inevitable flies and ant-families etc... toys on the floor and<br/>\ncushions on top of the kitchen counter are not considered messy here :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso recently when i helped my son with re-organizing his humongous lego<br/>\ncollection in color-based drawers.... he mentioned within a few days... that<br/>\nhe thinks its a great way to be able to find what he is looking for asap.<br/>\nBut he asked me to continue to help him stay on top of the chaos that ensues<br/>\nafter a couple of days of lego-mania.  so nice to have found a solution and<br/>\nbe able to help him with something that would drive us nuts... trying to<br/>\nfind a compass needle in a lego-stack ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLove and peace to all,<br/>\nHema<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nHema A.
