I feel like it presents a very very well researched case for each vaccine independently, addressess the implications of each age group and so forth. It does it without any pseudoscientific weirdness, melodrama and other distracting tactics.

I only mention that because while I know of and believe in vaccine damaged kids, most kids who get vaccines are going to be fine. It&#39;s just that its a roulette wheel, and no one can predict whose kid will have a problem. And some folks don&#39;t vaccinate and their kids can still get sick or have health issues otherwise derived.<br/>\nFor me, the decision was as another poster said, about the risks I was willing to take, and for me- What do I feel comfortable explaining to my kids when they are adults about the choices I made about their health? And this was the place I got to of comfort. I will do the mumps vaccine if they have a negative titer toward age 10 or so, and chicken pox if they are in adolscence with a negative titer. Offer it that is.

We&#39;ve moved a fair amount<br/>\nbut I&#39;ve always managed to find a family practice dr. who, although<br/>\nmay not share my opinion about vaccines, at least honors my right to<br/>\nmake a choice.

He&#39;s also never<br/>\nseen a pediatrician, or any MD for that matter.  I&#39;m a former ICU nurse, so<br/>\nI previously leaned more toward the mainstream.  I researched the issues<br/>\nintensively throughout the pregnancy.  It came down to this:  There are too<br/>\nmany unanswered questions about vaccines, and so the risk of my child<br/>\ngetting the diseases themselves looked like the better bet.  In other words<br/>\nthe risk of harm from the shots seems bigger than the risk of being damaged<br/>\nby one of the diseases they&#39;re intended to prevent.  PLUS the vaccines don&#39;t<br/>\nprovide &quot;immunity&quot;...sometimes they just don&#39;t &quot;take&quot;, other times they<br/>\nrequire boosters, etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt appears to me that we know MUCH more about how the brain works (just as<br/>\nan example) than we understand about the immune system.  Yes, vaccines have<br/>\nan &quot;effect&quot; measurable with titers, etc.  But what are all of the side<br/>\neffects?  What are the long-term effects of monkeying with the immune system<br/>\nas much as we do?  Is the massive increase in the incidence of many diseases<br/>\nin the past 10 or 20 years related to the growing list of &quot;mandated&quot; (for<br/>\npublic schooling) vaccines?  Why has autism incidence increased 1000% in the<br/>\npast 10 or 12 years (from 1 in 1500 kids to now 1 in 150)?  Did it have<br/>\nanything to do with the introduction of the HepB vaccine in 1991 or so,<br/>\nwhich took a few years for all states to mandate, but is now given to babies<br/>\nright after a hospital birth?  And why even give a vaccine for Hepatitis B<br/>\n(transmitted by sex or body fluids) to a neonate?  Why not schedule it<br/>\ncloser to puberty, when the immune system might be able to deal with it<br/>\nbetter?  Why do Amish populations (who shun vaccines) have ZERO incidence of<br/>\nautism?  If our U.S. doctors are such experts, why does the U.S. rank 40th<br/>\nin the world in mortality of children before the age of 1 (in other words,<br/>\n39 other countries have healthier babies...this is from the CIA World<br/>\nFactbook, available at cia.gov)?<br/>\n <br/>\nI really think that 2 or 3 decades from now, we&#39;ll look back at our current<br/>\nU.S. vaccine schedule (30 shots for 14 different things, all by the age of<br/>\n2) and put it in the category of Lunacy, the same category we use for<br/>\ntransorbital lobotomies and other medical treatments from the past that<br/>\nseemed to &quot;work&quot; in that they definitely had a measurable effect in the<br/>\nmoment, but caused irreparable harm.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=Brad in Missouri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: OT - Vaccines??","postDate":"1172094730","msgId":21573,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxMTUxNy40MjU5OC5xbUB3ZWIzMTkxMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVyaHFncCtvOW5qQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21566,"nextInTopic":21576,"prevInTime":21572,"nextInTime":21574,"topicId":21533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa .....

This form of polio is live and there is risk of contacting polio from the vaccinated infant. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think its something where you have to look at wether baby will be in daycare or at home.

MIL is one of 13 never vaccinated, and dh is one of eight never <br/>\nvaccinated, and there&#39;s something like 27 cousins, except for two of ours never <br/>\nvaccinated. We have the only two autistic kids in this huge family, unusual for a genetic <br/>\ndisease, don&#39;t you think? Anyway, the short story is that we haven&#39;t vaccinated any of our <br/>\nfive younger ones, and most of all seven have had measles, rubella, mumps and <br/>\nchickenpox.

The process for making vaccines requires the use of thimersol, so they use it, then &#39;wash&#39; it out, presumably removing all but a trace element. Really not truth in advertising, but vaxxing has never been that anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening. Never in the natural course of life would a body&#39;s immune system have to respond to all those invasions at one time, not to mention metabolizing the other chemicals in the vax mixes. As well, most of what&#39;s commonly vaccinated for I don&#39;t consider to be a big risk. I&#39;d personally rather my kids had mumps, measles, rubella and chickenpox and gain the lifelong immunity. I had them all as a child, so I don&#39;t need to worry about booster shots. Anyone who had the shots will need boosters thruout life to stay protected. And the vaxes aren&#39;t 100% -- sometimes they don&#39;t take at all, sometimes they take partially, leaving a person at risk for diseases that worsen when a person ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n------------ --------- --------- ---<br/>\nNo need to miss a message.

It was difficult <br/>\nbecause he , and his family,could not understand why I did not want to <br/>\nvax. It was my first , so I was also a bit scared like you. I read and <br/>\nread and asked literally for some sign from the universe that I am <br/>\nmaking the right decision. Right afterwards, some American friends of<br/>\nours had their little baby in an Italian hospital for a bad viral<br/>\nillness. She was fine but the mom had to stay with her there for a <br/>\nday. While there, there was a little baby screaming and crying all<br/>\nnight long in ICU, and the mom and family were crying saying..we know<br/>\nit was the vaccine! She was just fine before it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day, my friend was crying, being left alone in this hospital <br/>\nand not knowing Italian language well. A mom came by to comfort her <br/>\nsaying, &quot;dont worry, your child will be ok, it could be much worse, <br/>\nlike my little boy. THe boy was being carried in on his dads <br/>\nshoulders. MY friend asked what was wrong as he looked healthy, and <br/>\nthe mother said he was fine until a vaccine, then he could no longer <br/>\nwalk again. He was eight yrs old  now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scared my friend as she never thought much<br/>\nabout vaxing and we never even spoke of it together, though our dds<br/>\nwere the same age. She started to vax in America,,but just one or so<br/>\nand was going to do the rest while living in Italy. SHe and her <br/>\nhusband changed their minds that day and never vaxed again. Her <br/>\nhusband told mine, which convinced him finally. Enough to pull some <br/>\nstrings with the ITalian state so they stopped bothering us!! (law <br/>\ndifferent there)<br/>\nThat was my story. We have 2 healthy girls. Never ear infections, <br/>\nrarely colds (knock on wood...for my superstitiousness)We never went <br/>\nto the well visits or to any pediatrician for that matter. We go to <br/>\nhomeopathic drs when needed or other alternative drs. <br/>\nGood luck and just be informed! I have many downloaded articles on <br/>\nthis. If you want them. POst and I will send them out to you.<br/>\npamela<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Peters&quot; <br/>\n&lt;julieannpeters@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a quick OT question...has anyone here opted out of childhood <br/>\n&gt; vaccines completely -or- requested Mercury/Thimerosal-Free vaccines -<br/>\n&gt; or- gone against popular belief regarding other medical practices <br/>\n </span></blockquote>for <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; your children??<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My DB/SIL are expecting baby #1 in May and this seems to be a family <br/>\n&gt; debate right now.

The other book I recommend is: Vaccinations: A <br/>\nThoughtful Parent&#39;s Guide: How to Make Safe, Sensible Decisions about <br/>\nthe Risks, Benefits and Alternatives by Aviva Jill Romm.  This one came <br/>\nin handy when my youngest recently had Chicken Pox (got it from his <br/>\ndad&#39;s shingles).

The process for making vaccines requires the use of thimersol, so they use it, then &#39;wash&#39; it out, presumably removing all but a trace element.  Really not truth in advertising, but vaxxing has never been that anyway.<br/>\n    <br/>\n   For me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening.  Never in the natural course of life would a body&#39;s immune system have to respond to all those invasions at one time, not to mention metabolizing the other chemicals in the vax mixes.  As well, most of what&#39;s commonly vaccinated for I don&#39;t consider to be a big risk.  I&#39;d personally rather my kids had mumps, measles, rubella and chickenpox and gain the lifelong immunity. I had them all as a child, so I don&#39;t need to worry about booster shots.  Anyone who had the shots will need boosters thruout life to stay protected. And the vaxes aren&#39;t 100% -- sometimes they don&#39;t take at all, sometimes they take partially, leaving a person at risk for diseases that worsen when a person ages.<br/>\n    <br/>\n   Sylvia<br/>\n <br/>\n ---------------------------------<br/>\n No need to miss a message.

The process for making vaccines requires the use of thimersol, so they use it, then &#39;wash&#39; it out, presumably removing all but a trace element.  Really not truth in advertising, but vaxxing has never been that anyway.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  For me, the biggest issue isn&#39;t that I consider all vaxes to be dangerous, it&#39;s that exposing a child&#39;s immune system to 6 or 8 viruses at a time, every few months is frightening.  Never in the natural course of life would a body&#39;s immune system have to respond to all those invasions at one time, not to mention metabolizing the other chemicals in the vax mixes.  As well, most of what&#39;s commonly vaccinated for I don&#39;t consider to be a big risk.  I&#39;d personally rather my kids had mumps, measles, rubella and chickenpox and gain the lifelong immunity. I had them all as a child, so I don&#39;t need to worry about booster shots.  Anyone who had the shots will need boosters thruout life to stay protected. And the vaxes aren&#39;t 100% -- sometimes they don&#39;t take at all, sometimes they take partially, leaving a person at risk for diseases that worsen when a person ages.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNo need to miss a message.
