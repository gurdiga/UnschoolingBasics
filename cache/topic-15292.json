My husband was so sad because he had <br/>\na mom who never allowed him to have sugary cereal (always bought the huge <br/>\nbags of health food store puffed rice). Of course when he got to college <br/>\n(and really for many years until he decided to change his diet for his own <br/>\nreasons) he would buy the sugariest cereals or dump tons of sugar onto the <br/>\nhealthy stuff I would buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has now discovered TV and I dealt with the same feelings the original <br/>\nposter is dealing with. I admit I had used TV as a babysitter for a half <br/>\nhour each evening so I could make dinner. At first it was just Teletubbies <br/>\nwhen he was about 10 months old. He loved it and learned a ton from it. I <br/>\nused to think it was a creepy show until I sat and watched it with him <br/>\noccasionally. They have a lot of neat things on there - short films from <br/>\ndifferent countries with kids doing all sorts of new activities; singing; <br/>\ndancing, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 4 months ago we were both sick and stayed home all day watching movies <br/>\nand different kids TV shows. On that day he discovered Dora, Backyardigans, <br/>\nBarney and an animal show called Zoboomafoo. He loves these shows now and <br/>\ncan&#39;t get enough of them. Particularly Dora and Backyardigans. It&#39;s funny, <br/>\nthough. He HAS to watch each of these 2 shows at least once per day and he <br/>\nrejects any other ideas for activities I have for us. I start to worry and <br/>\nthen just when I feel like it&#39;s becoming too much I see him making <br/>\nconnections with real world events or people. We&#39;ll be out somewhere and <br/>\nhe&#39;ll point to something or someone or hear a song, etc., and say, &quot;like <br/>\nDora does&quot;. It will take me a minute to run through the episode in my head <br/>\nand see what connection he&#39;s making. Once I see how he&#39;s connecting them I <br/>\nreally can see how much he&#39;s learning from this new thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, after worrying about all this TV exposure (he&#39;s just 2) and then <br/>\nexploring my feelings through these forums and various unschooling books, I <br/>\nremembered how much I learned from TV when I was a kid. I can remember 10 <br/>\nspecific things I learned from TV at a young age (including particular <br/>\nreading rules that began to make sense through TV). It was weird to have <br/>\nthose memories crop up all of a sudden.

When he plays, he acts like he is IN the game- he jumps <br/>\naround on one foot, leaps in the air, &quot;steers&quot; the controller around <br/>\nwhile pushing buttons, and is quite the ball of energy. Everyone <br/>\nthought it was highly amusing (and stopped commenting). <br/>\n<br/>\nHe spent tons of time outside that weekend as well. It was cool to <br/>\nsee him able to step back and do whatever he felt like. Last summer <br/>\nwas our summer of him wanting to be indoors and playing all day <br/>\nwhile Emma wanted to be outside all day.

In other <br/>\nwords, they may be perfectly content with traditional homeschooling. Or <br/>\neven if they&#39;re struggling, they may not yet be actively seeking an <br/>\nalternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be best to wait for an opportunity that seems more ripe for <br/>\nthe picking rather than seek to convert people. In other words a local <br/>\nmom that I&#39;ve been working with on baby slings (she has twins) knows <br/>\nthat I am an unschooler. Her sister homeschools 4 kids and has a new <br/>\nbaby and is getting tired of beating her head against a wall trying to <br/>\nget her kids to do math and read more. She&#39;s actively asking me for <br/>\ninformation about unschooling. So I&#39;m trying to just drop little <br/>\ntidbits and not overwhelm her, and not judge her and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a local homeschooling group that is mostly unschoolers and <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been reaching out to all kids when we make plans for a summer get <br/>\ntogether, schooled, homeschooled, unschooled, etc. Whatever! Sometimes <br/>\nthe kids are the best advocates for this way of life. I invited this <br/>\n&quot;unschooling curious&quot; mom to join us at our next get-together and she <br/>\nasked if they are all recreational or if there are any academic <br/>\nactivities. I was pretty incredulous, that she would actively seek out <br/>\nacademic activities for her kids over the summer, but I kept it light, <br/>\nsmiled, and said, &quot;Well I guess the way we figure it is the schooled <br/>\nkids are off for the summer, so why not the homeschooled kids too? Plus <br/>\nwe think learning happens all the time anyway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me I could have either gone off, or I could have gone on and on <br/>\nbut I knew that either of those approaches might scare her away or <br/>\noffend her or bore her. I want her to trust me and have an open mind. I <br/>\nwant these little tidbits to percolate in her mind until they find a <br/>\nplace to take root and sprout.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is a) pick your opportunities <br/>\ncarefully to plug unschooling b) try not to take too overzealous of an <br/>\napproach (not saying *you* would, but sometimes we get passionate about <br/>\nsomething and get a little heated when discussing it) and c) just keep <br/>\ntrying to find people you enjoy spending time with whether they are <br/>\nunschooled, homeschooled, or schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nLead by example! Open the door wide and let everyone see what a <br/>\nrelaxed, joyful life it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 4, 2006, at 1:12 PM, Rebecca DeLong wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  I was hoping that someone may have some tips, ideas...anything, that <br/>\n&gt; could help me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  There is a fairly large homeschholing community in San Diego, and a <br/>\n&gt; small relaxed/unschooling subset.

I had decided that I would try<br/>\nletting my 4 y.o. son watch anything he wanted on TV<br/>\nat any time. The only thing that works on that TV is<br/>\nvideo or DVD, no regular channels, but we have plenty<br/>\nof the above. So, my 4 y.o. has been doing pretty well<br/>\nwith the self-regulating. He watches on average about<br/>\n1-2 videos a day. Many days he would not think of<br/>\nwatching because he would rather do other stuff like<br/>\nplay or read - Now in comes his little brother, 22<br/>\nmonths old. A few months ago I had put the TV away for<br/>\na bit so that he would not watch any, then pull out<br/>\nthe TV for the oder one when the younger one was<br/>\nnapping or had gone to bed. I had done that since the<br/>\nmovies that the 4 y.o. wanted to watch would stress<br/>\nout my little one too much. <br/>\nNow that the TV is in the open again, the little one<br/>\nwants to watch it almost all the time. He can easily<br/>\ngo from one movie to another without anything else<br/>\nthat would interest him. Before he would like to sit<br/>\ndown with a book or pretend-cook or help me in the<br/>\nkitchen or with the laundry - now the only thing that<br/>\nkeeps him away from the TV is going outside and<br/>\nsometimes painting. Now that it is summer I try to<br/>\ntake him out as much as possible, but it seems to me<br/>\nhe still watches too much for his age. I remember<br/>\nreading that kids under 2 should not watch any. So<br/>\nnow, how do I respect his wishes of really wanting to<br/>\nwatch badly, his health, and than the wished of his<br/>\nbrother who can&#39;t concetrate on playing if the TV is<br/>\non all the time.  He does not like to watch little kid<br/>\nmovies, he loves The Lion King and Babar and<br/>\noccasionally Bob the Builder. There are some bad<br/>\nscenes in those movies and I am not sure how he<br/>\nprocesses those things. I watch him watching the TV,<br/>\nand he is totally glued to it, occasionally commenting<br/>\non his favorite scenes to me. When things get a bit<br/>\nscary, sometimes I forward it ( if it is a video it<br/>\nupsets him)  or he wants to nurse while still<br/>\nwatching. <br/>\nI do tell him that sometimes he can not watch because<br/>\nhis brother wants to play and he can get very upset.<br/>\nBefore his big brother gets up he could easily watch<br/>\ntwo videos in a row without barely moving. He usually<br/>\nis a child on the go - very active and fearless and<br/>\nhappy when he can move. The only thing he sits still<br/>\nfor is TV. But when he does not get enough movement I<br/>\nbelieve it does not do him good. Sometimes after<br/>\nwatching I have to take him straight outside or he<br/>\ngets violent, starts hitting his brother with things<br/>\nor destroying his play. then I have the problem of one<br/>\nwanting to be inside playing with me and one needing<br/>\nto be outside. Neither one can be left alone yet. <br/>\nIt is sweet sometimes seeing them cuddled close<br/>\ntogether watching a movie, but I am just not<br/>\ncomfortable with my little one watching so much. Has<br/>\nanyone else had that kind of a problem or any ideas to<br/>\nit? <br/>\nOne thing I plan to do is get some sort of TV cabinet<br/>\nwhere I can close the doors but not sure that would do<br/>\nanything.  <br/>\nI do try to make the other toys very visible and<br/>\nexciting, but it just does not compare. <br/>\nthanks for any suggestions,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

My 2-ish year old son loves drawing on all <br/>\nthings except paper so I try to have lots of paper around. He would never go <br/>\ninto a cabinet for paper if he wanted to draw, though, so I try to have lots <br/>\nof little stacks of paper in his room (he has a little table with <br/>\nmarkers/crayons/paper) and I always seem to have scraps of paper around the <br/>\nhouse, too (usually blank envelopes from junk mail - reduce, reuse, recycle, <br/>\nya know?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also love washable markers and crayons. In fact, they are the only ones I <br/>\nbuy. Even when he draws on paper, there are often accidents where he runs <br/>\noff the paper and onto the floors or table, or accidentally hits the wall <br/>\nwith one while he&#39;s walking around, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, my son also gets frustrated with me at certain times if I try to do <br/>\nsomething with house work or my business while we&#39;re playing. That&#39;s often a <br/>\nsignal to me to keep playing with him and wait on the other stuff. Usually <br/>\nif I stop and think about it, the thing I&#39;m choosing to work on is something <br/>\nthat can wait. There are also times when I can get away with a few minutes <br/>\nhere and there of short spurts of work. There are also times when I know I <br/>\ncannot get any work done.

Once we start <br/>\n&gt;playing,<br/>\n&gt;she doesn&#39;t want a break for potty, eating, whatever.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Scenario:  This morning I was playing with dd.  We&#39;d been playing a variety<br/>\n&gt;of things for nearing 2 hrs.  We made our way to our new office library and<br/>\n&gt;were playing in there.  I saw a box of books that I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>\n&gt;shelve for months now.  It was only about 2 shelves worth and would take<br/>\n&gt;less than 5 min, so I thought while we&#39;re in here playing I&#39;ll go ahead and<br/>\n&gt;shelve the books.  So while dd was preoccupied gathering markers and<br/>\n&gt;pretending it was food I started shelving the books.  A minute later dd<br/>\n&gt;says, &quot;do you like what I drew mom?&quot;  she had scribbled on the carpet with<br/>\n&gt;one of the markers.  (This is not the first time this has happened with her<br/>\n&gt;drawing on something she&#39;s not supposed to to get my attention.  Once while<br/>\n&gt;she was coloring at the coffee table I left to go to the bathroom, as I was<br/>\n&gt;coming out she came towards me saying, &quot;come see what I drew mom&quot;.  She&#39;d<br/>\n&gt;scribbled all over the table.)  But, that&#39;s another scenario.  In this<br/>\n&gt;scenario she wasn&#39;t drawing with the markers at the time, but using them as<br/>\n&gt;a prop in her imaginary scene.  So anyway, I told her we were going to need<br/>\n&gt;to clean that up and we headed off to get supplies.  As we walked I asked<br/>\n&gt;her why she had drawn on the floor, she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t have any paper.&quot;  I<br/>\n&gt;reminded her about the paper in the art cabinet (in the same room) and not<br/>\n&gt;to draw on the carpet.  She started cleaning it up and I went back to<br/>\n&gt;putting the books away. (My fatal mistake, I now realize.. I probably <br/>\n&gt;should<br/>\n&gt;have stopped then and helped her clean).  So while I was finishing up,<br/>\n&gt;instead of cleaning she got more markers and drew even more.  A minute <br/>\n&gt;later<br/>\n&gt;when I found that she&#39;d drawn more.  I became much more agitated.  Since we<br/>\n&gt;had just talked about this.  I did pick her up and hug her, and told her<br/>\n&gt;that if she wants my attention of for me to play with her that she needs to<br/>\n&gt;tell me with her words not her actions.  She spotted a book she was<br/>\n&gt;interested in and asked to read it while we were cleaning up.  I told her <br/>\n&gt;we<br/>\n&gt;could read it after we cleaned it up.  She got upset and started asking to<br/>\n&gt;nurse.  Again I told her after we finished cleaning.  I also told her that<br/>\n&gt;when we have to take time to clean up writing on the floor that means it<br/>\n&gt;takes longer before I can play with her, read her book, have &quot;nummies&quot;, <br/>\n&gt;etc.<br/>\n&gt;After it was cleaned as best as it could, we read the story (twice) and<br/>\n&gt;nursed.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So here are my questions.  First of all, was that responding respectfully,<br/>\n&gt;or was there different I should have done.  Second, how can I get her to <br/>\n&gt;not<br/>\n&gt;do destructive things when I can&#39;t give her my attention?  We starting to<br/>\n&gt;plan on expanding on our family, and I&#39;m concerned about how she&#39;s going to<br/>\n&gt;act when I need to give my attention to a baby.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Thanks for your help.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Misty<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!

I think <br/>\nmaybe you&#39;re expecting a little too much from her in terms of 1) <br/>\nunderstanding 2) compliance and 3) self-control<br/>\n<br/>\nI my experience, most two year olds don&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; that it&#39;s not <br/>\nokay to draw on stuff other than paper. Maybe your DD really does know, <br/>\nbut the appeal in the moment of drawing on the carpet was too strong to <br/>\ndeter her. So to attribute to her actions that she did it &quot;to get your <br/>\nattention&quot; may not in fact be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d supervise when a kid this age is using markers, or make sure she is <br/>\nin a place where it doesn&#39;t matter if she goes off the paper. Washable <br/>\nmarkers are great. They really do wash out of stuff I&#39;ve found.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo year olds aren&#39;t good at being patient and waiting until after a <br/>\ntask is completed to start something else. Delayed gratification just <br/>\nisn&#39;t their cup of tea. If they want to play with you, they want it <br/>\nnow. If they want to nurse they want it now. You wanted to finish what <br/>\nyou were doing without interruption, but with a kid this age -- and <br/>\neven older -- that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to really *be* with her when she&#39;s drawing or playing and save the <br/>\nother organizational stuff for when she&#39;s napping. There are times when <br/>\nshe will play contentedly by herself too. You&#39;ll know the difference in <br/>\nher moods. This just wasn&#39;t one of those moments. She wanted to engage <br/>\nyou, yes, but that&#39;s probably not why she drew on the carpet. KWIM? She <br/>\nwas probably just proud of her drawing and wanted to share it with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably would have not left my dd alone with the markers at that <br/>\nage, but if she did draw on something -- and she has -- I&#39;d have said <br/>\nneutrally, &quot;I&#39;m going to get a damp rag to clean that up.&quot; and just <br/>\nstarted cleaning it. If she wanted to help me clean, cool, if not, <br/>\nthat&#39;s okay too. I have also said something like, &quot;Let&#39;s not draw on <br/>\nthe bannister from now on. Let&#39;s just draw on paper.&quot; No shaming, no <br/>\nyelling, no long lecture. (Not that you did that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes two year olds can be pretty sophisticated verbally, and this <br/>\nleads us to think that they should &quot;know better&quot; when they engage in <br/>\ncertain activities that aren&#39;t to our liking. But I&#39;ve found that it <br/>\ntakes a lot of patient repetition for the concepts to really sink in. <br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t mean lecturing, that would never fly with my DD, I mean, &quot;I <br/>\nsee you&#39;re getting out a box of markers, let me get you some paper. <br/>\nLet&#39;s make a card for daddy!&quot; And just make sure that she sees over and <br/>\nover that markers and paper go together like pb and j.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 3, 2006, at 3:34 PM, Misty Felner wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Scenario: This morning I was playing with dd.

At her <br/>\nage she is much to little to expect to clean up a marker mess IMO.  I <br/>\nthink she is acting pretty typical.  At this age she wants to be with <br/>\nyou constantly.  Cherish it...soon they don&#39;t!!  All 3 of my kiddos <br/>\nare off doing their own things right now.   I don&#39;t think she is at <br/>\nthe maturity of understanding not do color certain places with <br/>\nmarkers.  To her they are for creating.  For fun!!  She thinks she is <br/>\ndoing something cool not something bad.  I think you needed to be a <br/>\nlittle more observant at what she was up to and if you don&#39;t want <br/>\nmarker messes don&#39;t have them out for her to play with as imaginary <br/>\nfood.

Any<br/>\nadvice of a kinder gentler way?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nProblem - dd wants me to play with her all the time.  Once we start playing,<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want a break for potty, eating, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nScenario:  This morning I was playing with dd.  We&#39;d been playing a variety<br/>\nof things for nearing 2 hrs.  We made our way to our new office library and<br/>\nwere playing in there.  I saw a box of books that I&#39;ve been meaning to<br/>\nshelve for months now.  It was only about 2 shelves worth and would take<br/>\nless than 5 min, so I thought while we&#39;re in here playing I&#39;ll go ahead and<br/>\nshelve the books.  So while dd was preoccupied gathering markers and<br/>\npretending it was food I started shelving the books.  A minute later dd<br/>\nsays, &quot;do you like what I drew mom?&quot;  she had scribbled on the carpet with<br/>\none of the markers.  (This is not the first time this has happened with her<br/>\ndrawing on something she&#39;s not supposed to to get my attention.  Once while<br/>\nshe was coloring at the coffee table I left to go to the bathroom, as I was<br/>\ncoming out she came towards me saying, &quot;come see what I drew mom&quot;.  She&#39;d<br/>\nscribbled all over the table.)  But, that&#39;s another scenario.  In this<br/>\nscenario she wasn&#39;t drawing with the markers at the time, but using them as<br/>\na prop in her imaginary scene.  So anyway, I told her we were going to need<br/>\nto clean that up and we headed off to get supplies.  As we walked I asked<br/>\nher why she had drawn on the floor, she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t have any paper.&quot;  I<br/>\nreminded her about the paper in the art cabinet (in the same room) and not<br/>\nto draw on the carpet.  She started cleaning it up and I went back to<br/>\nputting the books away. (My fatal mistake, I now realize.. I probably should<br/>\nhave stopped then and helped her clean).  So while I was finishing up,<br/>\ninstead of cleaning she got more markers and drew even more.  A minute later<br/>\nwhen I found that she&#39;d drawn more.  I became much more agitated.  Since we<br/>\nhad just talked about this.  I did pick her up and hug her, and told her<br/>\nthat if she wants my attention of for me to play with her that she needs to<br/>\ntell me with her words not her actions.  She spotted a book she was<br/>\ninterested in and asked to read it while we were cleaning up.  I told her we<br/>\ncould read it after we cleaned it up.  She got upset and started asking to<br/>\nnurse.  Again I told her after we finished cleaning.  I also told her that<br/>\nwhen we have to take time to clean up writing on the floor that means it<br/>\ntakes longer before I can play with her, read her book, have &quot;nummies&quot;, etc.<br/>\nAfter it was cleaned as best as it could, we read the story (twice) and<br/>\nnursed.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are my questions.  First of all, was that responding respectfully,<br/>\nor was there different I should have done.  Second, how can I get her to not<br/>\ndo destructive things when I can&#39;t give her my attention?  We starting to<br/>\nplan on expanding on our family, and I&#39;m concerned about how she&#39;s going to<br/>\nact when I need to give my attention to a baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15331,"nextTopicId":15387}}
