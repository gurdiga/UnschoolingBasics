I&#39;ve been too afraid to take her out.  I &quot;unschooled&quot; her from 4th through 7th grade, but when I hurt my back, we made the choice for her to go back to school.  She is doing very well - A average (if you put much stock in grades).  I am unschooling my 2nd grade daughter (just pulled her from school last month), but my 7th grader and kindergartener are in school this year.  My &quot;ideal&quot; would be to homeschool them all, but I just don&#39;t feel I have the support.  I have no family in the area.  Noone at my church homeschools.  We happen to live in a very good school district, so very few in town homeschool.  It&#39;s a tough social choice for us to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiana<br/>\nstuck in &quot;paradise&quot; (Los Gatos)<br/>\nBTW, if you live in or near Los Gatos, and you &quot;unschool&quot; homeschool, PLEASE respond.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: hollandejt <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, November 30, 2007 12:08 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Ok, just getting started and feeling a little Panicky...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, slightly more than a &quot;little&quot; panicky. I dont know why...I know <br/>\n  we are making the right decision. Ive been thinking about this for <br/>\n  years and now my daughter has finally asked to homeschool. Today is <br/>\n  her last day at High School, she has been labled ADD, Learning <br/>\n  Disabled and Gifted, all of which mean nothing to me if we are <br/>\n  homeschooling. Unschooling is what I believe is the best way to go <br/>\n  for her...she needs to be interested in the subject matter, needs to <br/>\n  find her own rythm and motivation and she needs some freedom to <br/>\n  create and express herself and I TOTALLY believe in this &#39;method&#39; so <br/>\n  why am I suddenly panicking? I think it must just be the fact that we <br/>\n  arent using a cirriculum (except some unit studies for math)she wont <br/>\n  be getting any high school credits and she absolutely plans on going <br/>\n  to college as I&#39;m sure many of our kids are. <br/>\n<br/>\n  And it probably also has to do with the fact that everyone else is <br/>\n  panicking for me. We have a two year old who has Autism and other <br/>\n  health challenges that require a lot of time and tons of hours a week <br/>\n  of therapy and interventions (that are working really well). I work <br/>\n  part time outside the house (about 20 hours a a week if you include <br/>\n  driving time) and my husband works out of state during the week so I <br/>\n  do everything during the week on my own.
