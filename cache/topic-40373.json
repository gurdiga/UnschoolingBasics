The flavor and texture is so amazing. DS says that\r<br/>\nit tastes sweeter (with less sweetener) - makes sense, all the vital\r<br/>\noils in whole grains start going rancid as soon as the grain is ground.\r<br/>\nWe spent much time (better part of 2008) comparing prices on mills,\r<br/>\nchecking prices on grains, comparing that to the store bought organic\r<br/>\nwhole wheat flour we usually purchased and to comparable loaves of bread\r<br/>\nat the store (a real whole grain wheat bread with no HFCS or\r<br/>\nhydrogenated oils runs somewhere in the $3-$4 range at best, more if\r<br/>\nit&#39;s also certified organic ingredients). When grain prices jumped over\r<br/>\nthe last year or so, it started making more sense to do our own. The key\r<br/>\nto it all is having a reliable source for the grain (which we are\r<br/>\nfortunate to have - we order through the co-op market we shop at and get\r<br/>\n50 lb sacks of wheat every 2 to 3 months). \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.
