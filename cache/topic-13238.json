I was once a natural childbirth educator and I promoted this book to every mother who took my class.  I just recommended it to another new mom just the other day who is getting deeper into her spirituality.  I tell people that it is not a book just for those who study and practice, Buddhism.  It is a book with Universal principles that a mother can use not matter what her spiritual path may or may not look like.  You cannot go wrong with Buddha Mom!  Let me know if you read it.  I would love to hear your perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Lesa McMahon-Lowe <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, May 16, 2006 6:50 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] passions, control, and spirituality<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I came across this book while surfing blogs.
