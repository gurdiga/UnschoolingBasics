Ray was ebullient for the first few weeks after leaving school - thrilled that it was real, he was really &quot;free&quot; from the day in, day out misery and drudgery. After a few months I asked if he was bored at home - he was 13, and did the kind of &quot;cocoon&quot; thing that a lot of young teens do, spending an amazing amount of time sleeping and daydreaming and doing mellow things. He&#39;d  never been mellow before ;) He assured me that he was fine, he wasn&#39;t bored he was thinking - and that even if he was bored out of his skull he&#39;d been bored at school and home was better. That was nice to hear. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m curious as my son (8), on many days since we&#39;ve begun homeschooling, is resisting reading etc.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling won&#39;t work very well if you bring school home, or schoolish expectations.

With unschooling that stepping away from academic learning continues, but at some point, when your son begins to be comfortable with the idea, you begin to invite him along to do things with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe general guideline for deschooling is a month for every year of schooling (remember you&#39;ll be deschooling, too) and that restarts every time you press him to do some kind of academics, every time you press him to read, every time you press him to do a little math, or ask how much would that make? you get to start the count all over again. <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring deschooling act like it&#39;s summer vacation. Don&#39;t press for anything, play! Get down on the floor and play with the dog and your son. Rent movies about playing with dogs. Rent movies about whatever interests him. Watch the weather channel together, or not. Spend the next few months stepping away from all that is school. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo help with your own deschooling sign up for Pam Laricchia&#39;s newsletter ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/\">http://livingjoyfully.ca/newsletter/</a> ) and read and think about what learning really is.
