No one believes me, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s written down on my list of things that will happen. I didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow HOW to make it happen, I chat up construction guys when we run <br/>\nacross them (hey, having inquisitive kids kept me from being too shy) <br/>\nand it used to be you just worked your way into it. Now you have to <br/>\ntake classes and training sessions and stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we were at the state fair a few weeks ago, guess what I saw? <br/>\nA booth for a school not more than a few miles from my house. And <br/>\nwhat do they teach? How to work large vehicles. All kinds, not just <br/>\ncement mixers. I&#39;m prego right now, but dh snagged me the information <br/>\nand free video. Omg....I might go to schol. Or I might just keep <br/>\nchatting up construction guys and see if they&#39;ll let me drive one <br/>\nsome day. without all that stuff. Or I might even just skip to other <br/>\nstuff on the list and let the knowledge of possibility give me a <br/>\nlittle tickle whenever I think about it.

For me though, it has been along time since I felt I<br/>\n&gt; had<br/>\n&gt; the time to follow a true passion, I am kind of out of practice. I seem<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; only be following the passions that are easy or that ³fit in² with my<br/>\n&gt; past<br/>\n&gt; ideas of what a ³good² mom should be doing. Cooking is the strongest<br/>\n&gt; example. I love it and doing it makes me feel that I am showing love<br/>\n&gt; for my<br/>\n&gt; family. Win-win. But it is insufficient ­ I need more passions. Anyone<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; tips or experience to share about finding their passions after loosing<br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; for a long time?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-==-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I never really *lost* my desire to try new things. But I make a<br/>\n&gt; concerted effort to find new things all the time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have a &quot;Vision Board&quot; or &quot;Dream Board&quot; on our kitchen wall. Each of<br/>\n&gt; us writes down things we want to do/try/see/experience---both soon and<br/>\n&gt; in the more distant future. It can be ANYTHING---wild and crazy and<br/>\n&gt; hair-brained---or simple and plain. But writing it down seems to help<br/>\n&gt; &quot;make it real.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On the board now, we have<br/>\n&gt; Kelly: landscape front yard, make my own cheese, grow mushrooms, build<br/>\n&gt; chicken yard, kayak, Great Wall, knit socks, Machu Picchu<br/>\n&gt; Ben: Burning Man<br/>\n&gt; , Portland, Alaska, skydive<br/>\n&gt; Duncan: get a Weimaraner, Japan, California, laptop<br/>\n&gt; Cameron: kayak, perform Thriller @ L&L, Greece with family, WOOF, learn<br/>\n&gt; a language, Burning Man<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve already crossed kayaking, skydiving, new laptop, and performing<br/>\n&gt; Thriller off the list. &lt;G&gt; And we ALL did all of them---except Dunc<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t get to skydive because he was under 18! :-(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I bought a book and supplies to make cheese. I&#39;ve looked at websites<br/>\n&gt; for growing mushrooms. I have plans drawn up for the chicken yard<br/>\n&gt; (we&#39;ll build it in November when Cameron comes home from Mexico<br/>\n&gt; ---learn a language), and I have researched and picked out the breed of<br/>\n&gt; chickens I want (Wyandottes). We went kayaking for my birthday AND last<br/>\n&gt; weekend. Walking on the Great Wall and at Mach Picchu will have to<br/>\n&gt; wait. &lt;G&gt; Socks? I&#39;ll get around to it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; SO...my suggestion would be to make a list---a very, very long list of<br/>\n&gt; everything you have ever wanted to do that you haven&#39;t been able to<br/>\n&gt; do---and everything you now want to do.

Lately, as a SAHM, I <br/>\nhave been feeling adrift. I&#39;ve never had so much time for my <br/>\ninterests, although the time comes unpredictably during the day. Like <br/>\nyou, I&#39;ve been trying to discover new interests to enjoy in these <br/>\nmoments. Right now I need hobbies that I can start and stop fairly <br/>\nquickly. I have some existing interests (music) that I am <br/>\nreinvigorating. I also have been dabbling in new areas as was <br/>\nmentioned by other respondents. Below is an idea of how I came to <br/>\ndabble in some of these interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor L&L I decided to make aprons for my passion baskets. That was the <br/>\nfirst sewing I&#39;ve done since high school. Since those came out OK, I <br/>\ndecided to make the boys&#39; pirate costumes for the masquerade ball. <br/>\nThey turned out OK, so now I want to make some dress up clothes for <br/>\nthe boys. And for some bizarre reason, I want to make beanbags... <br/>\nlots of beanbags.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned cooking. I&#39;ve become interested in making food more <br/>\nflavorful, so I&#39;m spending some time learning more about herbs and <br/>\nspices. Last year at Christmas, I made spice mixes for gifts for the <br/>\nadults who don&#39;t need any more &quot;stuff.&quot; Based on positive feedback, <br/>\nI&#39;ll do that again this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite childhood memories was when my mom let us choose a <br/>\nbirthday cake from a book she had and then she would make it: <br/>\nbaseball mitt, castle, humpty dumpty, etc. So I decided to do that <br/>\nfor the boys and that led to an interest in decorating with icing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, I have been trying to remember interests that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nafford when I was younger, or that I didn&#39;t want to invest the time <br/>\nto explore when I was working/studying. These include painting, <br/>\nwriting, drumming, learning Spanish, and learning sign language. <br/>\nThese are on my short list of interests to pursue. I also have a <br/>\nbookshelf full of classic books and biographies that I want to read. <br/>\nFinally, I decided that I want to share a hobby with my DH, so I am <br/>\nthinking of learning to fly fish. (If I don&#39;t like the fishing part, <br/>\nI might like the creative aspect of fly tying....)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my journey to finding more &quot;passions&quot; involved dabbling in new <br/>\ninterests that support our current life (sewing, spices, icing), <br/>\nreflecting on unfulfilled interests from earlier times, and finding <br/>\nan interest to share with my DH. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\nFor me though, it has been along time since I felt I had<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the time to follow a true passion, I am kind of out of practice.

Each family <br/>\nthat wants to participate is required to lead a program or help in some <br/>\nway- administration or cleaning or something, and also pays $100 per <br/>\nsession towards rent and insurance. We have part time use of a gym and <br/>\nconference room, and full time use of an office suite, with 1 larger and <br/>\n2 small rooms. There is a public playground next to the building. A few <br/>\nfamilies, including myself in the past, have invested a HUGE amount of <br/>\ntime in setting this up. The responsibility is rotating around somewhat <br/>\nnow, with only 2 of the original 5 board members. We have a great <br/>\ndatabase interface that a member has set up, and there are 3 8-10 week <br/>\nsessions of jam packed 5 plus days a weeks, full days of programming for <br/>\nschool aged home schooled kids. in between sessions there are a few <br/>\nother things going on, though not much. The programming varies- this <br/>\nsession my kids signed up for basketball, biology, anime club, girls <br/>\nclub(which I organize as my contribution), drawing, desserts, and Friday <br/>\nfield trips. Many families treat it like school, and try to pick a class <br/>\nin each schooly subject area. We say pooh to that, and do what we feel <br/>\nlike- the kids have really loved it at times, though aren&#39;t so excited <br/>\nright now. My son is way busy with music so doesn&#39;t have much time for <br/>\nit. I can&#39;t help thinking everyday how much more awesome it would be if <br/>\nthere were even a few more radical unschoolers around- I feel really <br/>\nstrange being around so many school at home parents- big disconnect, <br/>\nwhich is why I am not so involved anymore. There are lots of different <br/>\ninteresting things to do there, and people tend to get along well. It is <br/>\nreally a great thing, but as I said - took a ridiculous amount of energy <br/>\nand commitment to get off the ground. There are also insurance and <br/>\nsupervision issues that cause a lot of stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather (in NY)<br/>\n<br/>\nk wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Oh now I would like to hear more about the learning center and how it came<br/>\n&gt; about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Katherine<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Not being boring ...

Anyone have<br/>\ntips or experience to share about finding  their passions after loosing them<br/>\nfor a long time?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____<br/>\nI can really relate to this and it&#39;s something I&#39;m continually working  on.  <br/>\nMy passion for years was just doing what my kids were doing and  helping them <br/>\ndiscover and broaden their interests.  Along the way, my  passions became what <br/>\nmy kids loved doing.  Not a bad thing (because I  was enjoying it)  but as I <br/>\nlooked around at other unschooling parents, I  realized they were also <br/>\npursuing personal interests that were&#39;nt  necessarily shared by their kids.  I had <br/>\nbeen busy working and  parenting and just hadn&#39;t considered much else.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I just started looking around at what my friends (both young and  old) <br/>\nwere doing and if something interested me, I tried it. I noticed at  that point <br/>\nthat it was my unschooling friends who had the most varied  interests. <br/>\n <br/>\n This has led to a host of things such as getting  chickens (don&#39;t have them <br/>\nany more...long story..&lt;g&gt;), playing the  guitar, jewelry making, gardening, <br/>\nnew recipes, beekeeping,  Zumba, cycling, art projects (check out the <br/>\nImagination Tribe yahoo  group), blogging, yoga, weight training and making pottery.<br/>\n <br/>\n My recommendation is to hang around someone like Kelly Lovejoy...or  Ren <br/>\nAllen....or read some of the interests of some of the unschoolers on this  list <br/>\nand just give it a try. You may try something for a day or a month or  it could <br/>\nturn into a lifetime passion.  My kids are just as supportive  about some of <br/>\nmy passions as I am about theirs and we find ways for us to pursue  them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the biggest thing for me was realizing that I could try anything I  <br/>\nwanted and not worry about what it might or might not turn in to.  I&#39;m  going <br/>\nKayaking next week for the first time in my life.  It could be a one  time <br/>\nthing....or maybe we&#39;ll buy kayaks and do it every weekend.

Daniel&#39;s advice to them was &quot;don&#39;t wait for a school, just find a tree and get started.  A year later, they had over 100 students and a building had been donated to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn his class, we did an exercise to help us find and follow our own dreams.  The first thing we did was to list our top 20 talents and interests.  In the class, it took us adults over 1/2 and hour, some prodding and discussion to list twenty.  At home, after the conference, all of my kids knocked theirs out in as much time as it took them to print the words.  My 11 yr old spent all of 8 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn his website, there are exercises, like the one we did, to help you find & follow your dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.findatree.com\">http://www.findatree.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBeing in a group environment really helped because we were able to make suggestions to one another and offer encouragement and advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, I think that when our kids see us following our dreams with a passion, it&#39;s probably the best education.  It&#39;s kind of hard to be a quitter when little eyes are waiting for your next intelligent move.
