The recommendation to <br/>\nbreath before reacting has helped a lot.  The breath helps me keep <br/>\nthat first knee-jerk thing I think of in my head from exiting my <br/>\nmouth.  I have also learned, in the case of sibling spats, that <br/>\nsilence is a fabulous tool.  It&#39;s amazing how easily an issue can be <br/>\nresolved by my children&#39;s own devices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that doesn&#39;t work, I still breathe first and try to separate my <br/>\nown feelings from the situation.  I then try to really listen to the <br/>\nchild(ren).  In the case of a fight, I try to separate the children, <br/>\nso that I can give each child my full attention while helping them <br/>\nto calm down.  I then try to sympathize with their feelings and <br/>\nvalidate them, if possible, by sharing my own experience in a <br/>\nsimilar situation.  I also might explain to each child what the <br/>\nother person&#39;s perspective might be and what that person might be <br/>\nfeeling.  I finally ask each child to tell the other how they are <br/>\nfeeling.  This can be very difficult because it&#39;s hard to articulate <br/>\nwhat you are feeling when all you really want to do is throw a shoe <br/>\nat the other person. :)  It is just amazing to watch the children <br/>\ninteract after I have taken them through this process.  They will <br/>\nvery gently tell the other how they are hurt/angry/upset and then, <br/>\nthis is the part that blows me away, actually make multiple <br/>\nsuggestions on how their sister/brother can avoid the incident in <br/>\nthe future.  They actually extend help to the other person that they <br/>\nwere mad at just a few minutes earlier.  Often times, after talking <br/>\nthey will run off to play together.
