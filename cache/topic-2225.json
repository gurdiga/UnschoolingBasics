Our life has been the hardest it&#39;s been in a long time, and I&#39;ve had no time to be on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason(dh) got really sick about 2 1/2 months ago and had to take some time off from school. He tried finding work but nothing was panning out, so I switched my hours at work so that I could work full time and bring in some more money. I was sooo tired and getting more pregnant. We were fighting with family because of Jason not being in school. And we were trying to decide if he was even going to go back. With me due the end of Sept, and no paid maternity leave through my work we didn&#39;t know what to do for money, but we moved to MI spacifically so Jason could go to school, and this was a very unexpected pregnancy, and we just couldn&#39;t figure anyting out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen last monday, after the biggest fight with my stepmom yet, I went in to labor and had to be checked into the hospital ( I still had 8 wks to go). I ended up with really brutal care by the residents, and only mine and Jasons loud and vocal protests that we were patients of the midwifes in the hospital brought about any change, we are now looking at a possible malpractice suit. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy midwife was able to stop my labor and was kind enough to let me come home, although I had to stay flat on my back and would not be going back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday, Jason sat my family down and told them he&#39;s not going back to school any time soon, and that he may not go back at all. And that if they continued to argue with me about it they would no longer be welcome in our life. They seemed okay with not saying anything, and they were really worried when i was put in the hospital.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday my midwife took me off of strict bedrest I can shower and sit for 30 min every couple of hours. And Jason, after calling and trying to find a job for months, called a place out of an add in last weeks paper and was hired over the phone! He started today, 40-70 hours a week (he has to work 40, but if he wants OT it&#39;s his) and he&#39;ll be making good money. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping that life is looking up for us. The boys are doing great though, they&#39;ve been haveing fun, playing outside, coloring, cooking. and are in the process of mastering 007 on the PS2. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to run, I have to go lay back down for a little while, I&#39;ll try to pop back in, in a few hours. I&#39;ve missed this group, and it looks like I&#39;ve missed a lot of good stuff...I&#39;ll attempt to wade through the archives when I can sit for longer. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It certainly isn&#39;t any more educational than just talking about our real world with our children.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI think much of the emphasis on reading to kids comes from the schoolish idea that parents don&#39;t spend any other valuable time with their kids, as if the only way to get parents to interact with kids is to make them sit down with a book.  Sadly, this seems to be true for so many people, who never learned to talk to kids like sentient beings.  Kids are so often minimized in our culture, that adults come to believe we need an artificial system for kids to learn what we know.  Just talk to your kids -- from the moment they&#39;re born -- about anything and everything.  Answer their questions and ask your own. Wonder aloud about things as you go thru your day, and your kids will learn to do the same, and that will spark all kind of conversation.  IMO, talking to them in the natural course of our day is much more valuable, as it is real life not some dumbed-down story about Curious George or the fuzzy bunny.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nVote for the stars of Yahoo!&#39;s next ad campaign!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Wild Days","postDate":"1090340430","msgId":2242,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzIwMTYyMDMwLjI0MTgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNkaXJmNyt0M3BhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2241,"nextInTopic":2244,"prevInTime":2241,"nextInTime":2243,"topicId":2225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh Melissa, Hang in there!

Dan refused any position but upright in the sling, even fr0m a few weeks old.  He absolutely would not be in the &#39;recline&#39; position recommended for newborns.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy first recommendation is to use a non-padded sling, like the Maya (or homemade). <br/>\n <br/>\nFor positioning Dan, until about 8 or 10 mos, I placed him in the sling vertically, with his feet tucked under him crossed (what we used to call sitting Indian-style), fully in the fabric like a pouch.  Until he was able to reliably hold his head up all day, and when he slept, I kept the sling fabric pulled up to the back of his head, as a support for his neck.  This put his face right up to my chest, where he would rest his cheek on my breast -- so sweet!  Gradually, as he got older I was able to move the fabric below his arms, allowing him more movement. Somewhere around 10 mos (as he hit 20 lbs) I started putting him more on my hip, with his legs hanging out of the sling.  This gave him a more outward look on the world, and relieved the weight some for me.  Also, the sling fabric at the shoulder should be fanned out with the ring as far from your neck as possible to save you back and neck pain.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe used the sling almost constantly when in arms until he was about 2.  In fact, when I finally stopped wearing it all the time, people teased me that they didn&#39;t recognize me without it!  It just takes a little time to get the hang of it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for the worries about too much TV, and feeling like you do too little for your girls, that will get better with time.  It really does take 8 to 10 weeks to settle in with a new little person, certainly 6 or so to establish a healthy nursing relationship.  This is important time for you and the baby, that for you will seem like a long time &#39;lost&#39; on a day-by-day basis, but for your girls will really fly by.  They won&#39;t lose anything important developmentally in this time.  What they will gain is the experience of seeing what it means for a mother to bond with her babe, and how much you love him.  By talking to them about what you&#39;re doing for the baby, and reminiscing what their baby days were like, you&#39;ll be able to reinforce for them how very loved they are and always have been.  You&#39;ll also have the opportunity to see them develop compassion and empathy for their brother.  All really good stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nCongratulations to you all,<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n*********<br/>\n <br/>\nI did get a sling, but am having a hard time using it -- I cannot find a position that seems comfy for the baby.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I had<br/>\ntried the sling with my daughter as an infant, but given up when we didn&#39;t<br/>\nseem able to make it work until she was on my hip and it was easier.  So<br/>\nwith my son, it took some time and a LOT of persistance on my part, but it<br/>\nwas well worth it.  I kept reading books on different positioning and kept<br/>\ntrying and trying and trying.  It was true that once in the sling babies<br/>\nwant to keep moving.  So if you are standing there trying different<br/>\npositions, your baby will likely protest.  So I kept trying a position, then<br/>\nmoving as soon as I was in a position, and we did find positions that my son<br/>\nliked after some time.  We did it because it HAD to happen.  I had a 2 year<br/>\nold who was NOT happy on her own, and he needed to be on my body and he<br/>\nneeded to be moving 24 hours a day for the first 12 weeks (I even spent the<br/>\nnights in motion in a rocking chair with a car pillow around my neck to try<br/>\nto doze - until my freaked out by his birth daughter woke up which was<br/>\nhappening three or four times a night, and then my husband would walk the<br/>\nbaby while I tried to get her back to sleep).  You can also get help with<br/>\nthe sling and positioning from other moms and leaders at La Leche if you go<br/>\nto meetings in your area.  Also, many areas have Attachment Parenting (API)<br/>\ngroups and you can get assistance from moms at those meetings too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of how I handled things, I got anything I could find to do with my<br/>\ndaughter while either in a rocking chair or moving in a sling.  Since<br/>\nreading while walking with the baby in a sling was tricky, I went more to<br/>\nstorytelling which she loved.  I got body crayons so that I could draw on<br/>\nher hands and body while in the rocking chair.  She watched endless hours of<br/>\nZoboomafoo and quite frankly I was grateful and thankful that she could make<br/>\nthat choice since so much of the rest of the time my high spirited daughter<br/>\nfelt the loss of me so intensely, had a hard time being distracted, and that<br/>\nwas very very hard on both of us until my son started napping on his own at<br/>\n12 weeks so that she finally got time with me again where we could do what<br/>\nshe wanted when she wanted it.  She got some comfort from tandem nursing,<br/>\nalthough that was also a rocky road for my two (but that&#39;s a long story off<br/>\ntopic).  I would have been thrilled to see her running wild and happy<br/>\nwithout me since that would have meant that she was happy and my baby was<br/>\nstill able to get what he needed.  As it was, I spent a lot of time crying<br/>\nbecause I couldn&#39;t split in two and be two people, I had little support<br/>\naround me, and because many days it felt like no ones needs got met.

Is there a local La Leche League group?  You&#39;re <br/>\nsure to find a Mama or two there who would be happy to show you how to <br/>\nuse it and a few different ways to wear your baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [ He protests whenever we try it, so I have been stuck in a chair most<br/>\n&gt; of the time...if I am not carrying him while he is attached! ]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep, BTDT too.  :)  My DS loved his sling and I used it daily.  He&#39;d <br/>\nnap in there, nurse any time he wanted, got a great view, etc.  My DD <br/>\n(2nd born) *hated* being in the sling, but she has issues with feeling <br/>\nconfined to this day (3-1/2yo) and won&#39;t wear pants or skirts because <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t like the squeezing feeling around her.  She wear underwear <br/>\nunder protest, but I recently bought her ones that are too big and <br/>\nshe&#39;s OK with those because they&#39;re not hugging her.  Shirts and <br/>\ndresses need to be loose on her...no &quot;empire&quot; waist dresses or high arm <br/>\nholes that poke her arm pits.  Tags must be removed.  Seams need to lie <br/>\nflat.  You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t like the sling until she was an older baby so I just did <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re doing now...hold her with one arm while she nurses and I&#39;m <br/>\nup walking around.  That&#39;s the only solution that worked for us.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Something specific that is really bothering me is that since the last<br/>\n&gt; weeks of my pregnancy, the girls have been watching unlimited<br/>\n&gt; tv/videos.

And that perhaps they would be doing<br/>\n&gt; more if I was better able to facilitate it.  I have offered to read<br/>\n&gt; them books during the day when there have been a few precious<br/>\n&gt; moments, but they have been caught up in something else and it gets<br/>\n&gt; forgotten, or the baby needs me before they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve got a lot on your plate right now.  Just let the TV issue go.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re fine!  :)  Their brains won&#39;t turn into pudding because they&#39;re <br/>\nwatching lots of PBS or videos.  Do you think that they&#39;re not learning <br/>\nanything from TV?  It sounds like (to me) that your anxiety is that you <br/>\ndon&#39;t feel needed and you&#39;ve lost that special connection with your <br/>\nDDs.  It&#39;s still there!  Just be happy that they&#39;re happy and that <br/>\nyou&#39;re able to concentrate on nourishing and nurturing your new little <br/>\nDS and getting the rest you need to heal from his birth.  Think of it <br/>\nas a vacation that you&#39;re on and just allow your girls the freedom to <br/>\nspend their time how they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey couldn&#39;t be watching TV *all* the time or they couldn&#39;t be running <br/>\nwild and free a lot too.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; [ I think, I was prepared but still expecting to be needed and to at <br/>\n&gt; least<br/>\n&gt; be able to have time to read with them, as I decided that was the one <br/>\n&gt; thing<br/>\n&gt; we would &quot;do&quot; every day.]<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But did your girls have any say in that decision?

Don&#39;t think that they don&#39;t need you just as <br/>\nmuch as they did before.  :)  Maybe they&#39;re just finding out what they <br/>\ncan do for themselves right now and it&#39;s exciting to challenge <br/>\nthemselves.  In turn they&#39;re letting you rest up so you can join them <br/>\nsoon.  Postnatal time can be very emotional for us Mamas.

My last three babies have nursed the same. Right now Cameron is <br/>\nalmost 3 months old and is just getting to the point where he can sit/lay/swing <br/>\nso I can actually take a shower or go potty. My other kids ages 2 , 4 and 12 <br/>\nhave adjusted well. Nicholas actually started using the potty on his own it was <br/>\na memorable moment when he began. I was in another room (glued to the couch) <br/>\nwhen I heard the &quot;dunt da na na&quot;music from the potty chair. He was grinning <br/>\near to ear excited over the sound of his pee when I walked in. He was ready so <br/>\nhe did it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIve been pasted to our couch the past three months which does feel like <br/>\nforever when your in it but it gets better I promise.<br/>\nI think I have seen every blues clues, teletubies, Dora, and Caliou (sp)show <br/>\nnow. <br/>\nBUT, Cassidy has picked up on some spanish, has spelt some new words and we <br/>\nhave engaged in some great conversations. Nicholas has adjusted very well. <br/>\nDustin has been biking, surfing (we have made a couple beach trips) and playing <br/>\nwith friends. He will hang out a bit in the am and then he&#39;s off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the time that we have had to sit Cassidy writes all of our names <br/>\nincluding Nicholas and Cameron and has much better print than I.  She probably draws <br/>\nor writes 50% of the day she just loves it. I think it began when I had <br/>\nNicholas. He nursed like Cam does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a sling also. Cameron loves it esp if I am moving about. If I sit he <br/>\nisn&#39;t as comfortable. I do hope you can find a comfort zone for the sling my <br/>\nkids and I just love them!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour girls are at great ages. I wouldn&#39;t worry at all about the tv/movie <br/>\nsituation. I personally dont limit any tv and they are always on (I need noise) <br/>\nbut often they are not even watching it (unless I change the channel then <br/>\neveryone notices). The first few months is only temporary and can be a great time <br/>\nfor you all to color, play games, do hair, watch movies, SLEEP and have fun. I <br/>\nsay sleep bc my first two months with my newborn Nicholas went down for a nap <br/>\nand Cassidy and I slept on the couch and I nursed and slept for a couple hours. <br/>\nI needed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is sometimes hard to see that they are doing something but I think you <br/>\nhave seen a bit of it with the potty and the bike. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura~Maine<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"pam sorooshian","from":"pam sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Wild Days","postDate":"1090300833","msgId":2226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg2MkU4Q0RELURBMEMtMTFEOC04MTY4LTAwMEE5NUUyOTJDNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNkaTF0aitvZmdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNkaTF0aitvZmdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2225,"nextInTopic":2227,"prevInTime":2225,"nextInTime":2227,"topicId":2225,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
