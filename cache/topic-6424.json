Bearing in mind they are both severely autistic and <br/>\nstill in nappies, can&#39;t dress or undress themselves yet e.t.c I understand <br/>\nyour worries over getting through it with small children.   I would be more <br/>\nworried about it if I was trying to do school at home tho lol.<br/>\nAll I can say is life goes by. Never how you expect, never perfect or <br/>\nimperfect but it just goes along. Each day is different and one bad day does <br/>\nnot mean you will have another the next day. Your girls will grow and so <br/>\nwill your son and so will you.  I can&#39;t honestly say I have time for me much <br/>\nanymore - but if I did I would probably be lost. I do my own thing around <br/>\nthem - craft, ( mosacing is my thing) art, reading and gardening. They <br/>\nsometimes join in,  they sometimes fight and they sometimes do other stuff <br/>\nwhile I a m doing things I like. Other times I have to stop cos they need <br/>\nsome attention for themselves.  Dh is a house renovator to add to this. We <br/>\nnever have a tidy house and never a room finished.  We all agreed that the <br/>\nolder kids go up at between 8 and 9 pm each night to their rooms to play. <br/>\nThey are not forced to but they see I need time with dh.  This does not <br/>\nstopped them coming down constantly for drinks, asking questions and hugs <br/>\ne.t.c.  I really, truly believe in the way we live and that has got me <br/>\nthrough bad times.  Winter is not nice - rain and cold and kids stuck <br/>\ninside.  Other peoples opinons can be hard to take when you are new to it. <br/>\nThe good times far outweigh any bad tho. I love my life. The kids love their <br/>\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuth in the UK</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6414,"nextTopicId":6421}}
