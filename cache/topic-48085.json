My 5 year old (and the rest of the family!) have been officially deschooling since this past November.  Carolina watches She-Ra, Dora, Crashbox, Backyardigans, Out of Egypt and Bizarre Foods.  Sometimes she watches Dr. Oz.  Just now, I took a photo of a beautiful tower she built while watching Crashbox and Wow Wow Wubbzy (this one is my 3 year old&#39;s show preference).  I am consistently amazed by what she builds while watching (or not watching) TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your son have other things available to him near the TV?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for concerns about being anti-social -- where is your son on the extrovert-introvert scale?  I am an introvert and a loner but it took being in my 30s before I realized that was OK.  School and the accompanying social environment often rewards the extroverted.  I learned to act extroverted but it was exhausting.  My career in film editing was a perfect fit for much of who I am and what I love.  As an introvert, I spend the majority of my work time in a dark room alone.  As someone who values a few close connections vs. many acquaintances, my work environment puts me in daily contact with a few working towards a project for about a year.  Cutting rooms often forge intimate family-like friendships while each person spends many hours working in a solitary way.  And film editing allows me to play with story, emotion, psychology, character, visuals, soundscapes and music -- things I really love spending time thinking about and playing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling gives you and your son the opportunity to explore his interests.  What of the monolithic TV is he interested in?  What shows?  What characters?  Why?  My 5 year old pretends she&#39;s She-Ra, even while watching her show.  She gets dressed for it, adds props and rides the back of the love seat as her trusty steed.  Some friends I have that you might recognize have made very profitable careers pretending.  And you bet their focus is prized, not a detriment to their success.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpend more time with your son while he&#39;s watching TV.  See what he&#39;s seeing if you can.  My daughter&#39;s love of She-Ra has sent us out searching for the perfect pieces to pull together her costume.  We have also searched online to see others&#39; interpretations.  She met a little boy at the park who loves superheroes like she does and they were in heaven playing out their favorite characters with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142480739,"authorName":"lindaguitar","from":"&quot;lindaguitar&quot; &lt;lindaguitar@...&gt;","profile":"lindaguitar","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: tv and deschooling","postDate":"1332993966","msgId":48125,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpsMG4zZStuZjhmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGprc3MyNCtrMG5hQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48113,"nextInTopic":48232,"prevInTime":48124,"nextInTime":48126,"topicId":48085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So I haven&#39;t tried to start those kinds of conversations with Mo. Instead, I&#39;ve taken some of the advice of other unschoolers and talk about tv shows and movies with my kids essentially the same way I would with a friend, rather than making a lesson of my personal values. And what I&#39;ve seen with Mo is that I haven&#39;t needed to coax her to be thoughtful about what she watches. She lives in a home where thoughtfulness is a normal part of the environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Mo loves Ed, Edd and Eddy - and I&#39;m So not a fan of that show, but haven&#39;t said much more than &quot;not my favorite&quot; - she loves it, and I don&#39;t tend to put down things my friends love. About a week ago, she was re-reading the Bone anthology and noted that some of the characters are essentially the same characters as the Eds - and then made the jump that there are Other stories which use the same characters: the Fool, the Intellectual, the Con Man. I hadn&#39;t made that connection until she brought it up - I was bogged down with &quot;ick, the Eds&quot; and not considering them as literary archtypes. Mo notices connections and relationships, though, so it was natural for her to see the Eds as something more than just cartoon characters. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: tv and deschooling","postDate":"1332853518","msgId":48106,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzI4NTM1MTguNjUzMTMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjg3MzAxLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGprc2Nocys4cXQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDE2MTUwMzgwMDIuMTI4ODM2Ny4xMzMyNzc0MTczNzIwLkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAbWQ0OC5lbWJhcnEuc3luYWNvci5jb20+IDxqa3NjaHMrOHF0NUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48105,"nextInTopic":48108,"prevInTime":48105,"nextInTime":48107,"topicId":48085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ____________________________________ If television is the main thing your child is interested in, if television is what he or she is enjoying doing much of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-926824690\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;So, sitting on the couch the whole time your son is watching TV -- not necessary.

I like watching them laugh and be interested at least as much as I like watching the show. I also like finding the value in what they are watching. Seeing what it is that appeals. Linnaea&#39;s been watching Toddlers and Tiaras lately and I spent a couple of hours watching episodes with her on youtube the other night. It&#39;s a show that makes me cringe, and she was watching it, in part, to cringe. She was fascinated by the parents pushing their own interests on the children. And by the children who were shining because they were the driving participants in the beauty pageants. If I hadn&#39;t watched the show with her, watched her watching the show and had judged the show as outside of my own tolerance, I wouldn&#39;t have had such a good time, or known what she was deriving--at least in some part--from her time spent watching it.Â <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are shows I struggle to watch. I have a really hard time with Fawlty Towers or with Seinfeld or with Borat or Peep Show. I have a hard time with people being set up or setting themselves up to fail, it hurts me to watch them. Not that I don&#39;t laugh, not that I don&#39;t have moments of enjoying them and not that I don&#39;t understand why they are enjoyable. Just that I want so much for the lives on the show to be good and happy and better that I spend too much of the time unhappy for the characters. But I&#39;ve watched all of those shows and found ways to enjoy them. Mostly I watch the watchers, however. Mostly I relish their enjoyment. And I don&#39;t need to talk about what makes it hard for me, or my own morality, or my own difficulty with people who continue to reside in misery. I don&#39;t need to share my misery with those who are enjoying the show. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: tv and deschooling","postDate":"1332830957","msgId":48101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprcm50ZCtvNTlpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE2MTUwMzgwMDIuMTI4ODM2Ny4xMzMyNzc0MTczNzIwLkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAbWQ0OC5lbWJhcnEuc3luYWNvci5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48099,"nextInTopic":48102,"prevInTime":48100,"nextInTime":48102,"topicId":48085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: It s just that I need to deschool myself and tell myself that I am not wasting my time with shows that I m not really personally","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-431084933\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Janelle Hertzler <br/>\n&lt;jshertzler@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  It&#39;s just that I need to deschool myself and tell myself that I am not<br/>\nwasting my time with shows that I&#39;m not really personally interested in.<br/>\nRather I am spending time being with my son and nothing can replace<br/>\nthat.

Is there at least one cartoon show that he watches that you also enjoy? I used to watch the children&#39;s shows that *I* also liked, with my kids. Like Rugrats, The Wild Thornberries, The Fairly Oddparents, Reading Rainbow, Blues Clues, and Zoom, to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also encouraged the kids to watch TV shows and movies with me that *I* liked - if it was something that I thought was appropriate for children. We watched the various Star Trek series and Stargate and other sci-fi shows together. We watched family shows like Home Improvement, with Tim Allen, and old reruns of the Cosby Show and Roseanne. Sometimes we watched The Simpsons. We also all enjoyed watching science and nature shows. When my kids were a little older, we loved watching Futurama together. I also made a point of getting some of the older movies that were my childhood favorites on video or DVD, to watch with my kids. (I also read them all of my favorite childhood books, over the years.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are shows that your child likes to watch that you don&#39;t enjoy, but that you can tolerate, is there something you can do in the same room while he watches, so that you&#39;re aware of what the show is about and can talk to him about it, but also do something for yourself at the same time?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son likes a certain show that you really can&#39;t stand - well, just speaking for myself, I never stayed in the room if my kids were watching something I thought was either really stupid or very gross/disgusting. If I saw them watching something that I thought was promoting character traits that I thought were contrary to my values (traits like meanness, selfishness, violence, jealousy, obsession with looks and other superficial things), I would start a discussion about those shows and characters afterwards. Like &quot;What would you have done in that situation?&quot;, or &quot;What do you think that person could have done that would have made the situation turn out better, or avoided that bad situation?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same is true now, when I babysit. Some of the kids I babysit are allowed to watch TV or YouTube videos. If they choose to watch a show or video I like, I watch it with them. If they choose a show I don&#39;t like, I tend to go into another room.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, despite all the anti-TV propaganda, I have never thought of watching TV as a waste of time - except when I watch TV shows that I don;t really enjoy, simply as an excuse to procrastinate. (These days, I use the internet when I&#39;m procrastinating, putting off doing housework. LOL!) <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: tv and deschooling","postDate":"1332781733","msgId":48099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGprcTdyNSsyYXQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhKS0w4TnJ1UjBUYVZLVjc5X1VKMl9CcnVPOE52cm5xNkpncFYtdD1pVTMxdER3UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48098,"nextInTopic":48101,"prevInTime":48098,"nextInTime":48100,"topicId":48085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Work to meet his desire to watch television. Don&#39;t work to distract him from it. Sit with him and watch what he&#39;s watching. Become an active partner in his engagement with the television.

When he&#39;d tell me a story that he&#39;d been working on, it was a kind of fan-fiction with Simon cast as a central character.

We were so excited by his physicalness, his story-telling that we needed to own it in our own bodies. Or something. It left us with adrenaline to spend. I imagine that what Simon does is something similar. The story, the action, excites him in a very physical way and so he processed his relationship with the story in a physical way.Â <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Â If there is reason to interrupt this running/story-telling, it takes a great deal of work to get his attention.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try not to find reasons to interrupt him.

Don&#39;t tell them things that get them to give you advice. If their wisdom comes unsolicited, thank them for their concern and tell them that you are going to try this way for a year and see how things go and then change the subject, move the conversation on to something else. If they continue to press, if they really want to &quot;fix&quot; your son, then try not to spend quite so much time with them for a while, at least until the worry voices in your own head are relatively quiet. Don&#39;t let them dissuade you from the belief that your son doesn&#39;t need fixing.

When we first got a satellite dish Mo went through a long period of watching a lot of tv and drawing - and drawing and drawing and drawing! It was like the tv set her mind on fire and all at once she was full of images. Pretty cool. Nowadays she spends a lot of time jumping on the trampoline telling herself stories. Some of those she&#39;ll write down or draw as comics, or program into short animations, but not all. There are too many stories to get all of them down, and many are variations - fan stories, if you like, where she&#39;ll take a character from a tv show or movie or game or book or song (any character from anywhere at all) and tell a story around that person. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If there is reason to interrupt this running/story-telling, it takes a great deal of work to get his attention.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nWe try to plan outings around Mo&#39;s routines. If she&#39;s in busy project-mode, getting her out the door is going to be rough. Same if she&#39;s jumping on the trampoline, or in the middle of a movie. She doesn&#39;t like to stop in the middle of things. She can, but she doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to think of your son in terms of having a very long attention span. When other adults complain that he&#39;s too focused, shift the direction of the conversation that way - yes, he has a Fantastic attention span! <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you hanging out with him? Are there plenty of other things to do in the same room as the tv? As long as he has lots of other interesting options, I wouldn&#39;t worry about the tv. He&#39;s finding something wonderful and stimulating about it, and that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146052230,"authorName":"Sacha Davis","from":"&quot;Sacha Davis&quot; &lt;sacha@...&gt;","profile":"sacha_pie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] tv and deschooling","postDate":"1332702144","msgId":48086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2ODEuMTI4Ljk1LjIzOC43OS4xMzMyNzAyMTQ0LnNxdWlycmVsQHdlYm1haWwuZHJpenpsZS5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGprbm1iMSs1NXVrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"IDxqa25tYjErNTV1a0BlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48085,"nextInTopic":48088,"prevInTime":48085,"nextInTime":48087,"topicId":48085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Would she say the same thing if he<br/>\nwas reading all day and then those stories were catching his imagination? <br/>\nI was/am an avid reader and TV watcher and sometimes even now my mind is<br/>\nfilled with all the stories I absorb.  Out of this I write and think about<br/>\ncharacter and plot.  And I can entertain myself quite easily on my bus<br/>\nride home.  If your son&#39;s head is filled with stories finding a way for<br/>\nhim to tell them might be beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory in general is to give all things at least a year.  New baby -<br/>\ngive it a year.  New sibling - give it a year.  New job - give it a year. <br/>\nTaking limits off TV - give it at least a year.  Deschooling - give it a<br/>\nyear, give it longer, give it as long as it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.

My son spends the majority of his time at home watching tv, which I know is not uncommon for deschooling--especially in families that used to have limits on tv.
