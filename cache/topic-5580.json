I finished the book yesterday.  I loved it!<br/>\nHmmm..maybe not &quot;loved&quot;, but I really like it a lot!  The subtitle is &quot;How<br/>\nToday&#39;s Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter.&quot;  I found it while<br/>\nbrowsing the bookstore a few days ago.  I decided to go ahead and buy it,<br/>\nhoping that it might be a good loaner book - i.e. to the moms of all my<br/>\nson&#39;s friends who have to earn privileges to play games (who LOVE to come to<br/>\nour house, where they can play Nintendo & X-box all they want LOL).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to check out his other books.  He does discuss the value of playing<br/>\nvideo games, but also talks about a lot more - how our culture is not<br/>\n&quot;dumbing down&quot; like many articles claim.  He talks about how everything is<br/>\nbecoming increasingly complex - tv shows, movies, video games (PacMan vs.<br/>\nSimcity) and so forth.  He spends some time analyzing popular tv shows<br/>\n(Sopranos, 24) and discusses the complex social relationships and story<br/>\nlines that a viewer has to keep track of that older shows didn&#39;t have.  He<br/>\npoints out that many popular shows (The Simpsons) & movies (Harry Potter,<br/>\nFinding Nemo) are now intergenerational - parents & kids can both enjoy the<br/>\nsame show together, because of the layered meanings and references hidden<br/>\ninside many shows (which shows have to have now, because of technological<br/>\nadvances like recording - so we can watch the same show multiple times, so<br/>\nit better be interesting or we&#39;ll be bored and not buy it on DVD).  He talks<br/>\nabout how tv shows are more participatory - yes, even &quot;passively&quot; watching<br/>\ntv - and exercise our emotional intelligence (&quot;What would I have done if I<br/>\nhad been on that episode of Survivor?&quot;).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe uses economics, technology and neurobiology to help explain his theories<br/>\nin part two.  He even discusses IQ scores.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe claims that the violence in video games that critics complain about is a<br/>\nnon-issue.  The content of the game, including the violence, is only<br/>\nincidental to the problem solving required to complete the game.  He talks<br/>\nabout how some argue that book reading is in decline, but says those same<br/>\nfolks fail to point out that everything else is also in decline.  We have so<br/>\nmany more options today and so spread our time out among many different<br/>\nactivities, of which book reading is just one. He also talks about how we<br/>\nare doing more of our reading & writing online (duh!). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found it interesting that near the end, he backtracks a bit as if he&#39;s<br/>\nafraid he&#39;s going to be criticized and makes a disclaimer.  Ok, here it<br/>\nis.page 193 (the &quot;book&quot; ends at page 199 although  &quot;Notes&quot; continue to<br/>\npages 234):   &quot;I realize that, in writing this book, I have set myself up to<br/>\nbe misrepresented as the guy who argues that kids should be allowed to play<br/>\nDoom all day, and never open a novel.  So let me be clear for the parents<br/>\nwho are reading this.  Yes, the trends are toward more media complexity;<br/>\nyes, games and television shows and films have cognitive rewards that we<br/>\nshould better understand and value...Where our media diets are concerned for<br/>\nall of us ---young, old, or somewhere in the middle-the commonsense rule<br/>\nstill applies: moderation in everything.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then he states his case again :-) - <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;But neither should we deny ourselves the occasional obsession.  These are<br/>\ndeep, rich worlds being created on our screens; you can&#39;t truly experience<br/>\nthem-you can&#39;t probe their physics and telescope your way through their<br/>\nmultiple objectives-without becoming a little obsessed in the process.

(Middle school starts in fifth grade in our district). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband who is home more than I is more sold on unschooling and I have my ups and downs about it. Right now I am feeling more optimistic as I see my son grow more vibrant and confident and as our relationship, which I didn&#39;t know needed improvement, has deepened. <br/>\n<br/>\nYet since we have settled into unschooling he does spend most of his time playing computer and video games, doing computer graphics and some television. He was in the gifted program and has acquired basic school skills and that is some consolation although I get scared when I imagine that he will never advance beyond what he has now. Yet in my more open-minded moods, I see that in addition to these games, he is participating on online forums in which he writes letters and stories and creates animation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also read a very encouraging article in the May 16 New Yorker called &quot;Brain Candy&quot; which reviewed a book called &quot;Everything Bad is Good for You&quot; by Steven Johnson.
