The ones that go so far as even to demean their own<br/>\nchildren,UGH!  BUT this is what he wants and I won&#39;t say anymore, not<br/>\nit&#39;s all supportive, I gave the warning and he&#39;d rather try.  I only<br/>\nwarned because he&#39;s never played, whereas others have played for<br/>\nyears.
