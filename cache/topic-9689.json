I agree that homeschooling and  <br/>\nunschooling will probably look different when there isn&#39;t a built-in companion  that <br/>\nyour son can run off and play with. On the other hand, there are no sibling  <br/>\nfights. (Mom, wherever you are, please once again accept my apologies!)<br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;ve been homeschooling for a while, and your son already has friends he  <br/>\nspends time with. I assume when you were homeschooling vs. unschooling that  <br/>\nevery hour was NOT taken up with structured schooling. The rest of time, I  <br/>\nsuspect, sometimes you hung out together and played together, or chatted.  <br/>\nSometimes he spent hours creating with legos or watching movies. Maybe you read  <br/>\ntogether or separately, or made cookies, or maybe he rode his bike, with family,  <br/>\nfriends, or by himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe difference with the unschooling is that he gets to do the fun stuff all  <br/>\nthe time and you can stop planning lessons and do fun stuff too.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;d be wonderful to have an unschooling companion next door. But even if  <br/>\nyou did, they might or might not like each other. I think if it&#39;s even a  bit <br/>\npossible that Unschooling conferences are really great for only children,  <br/>\nespecially as you approach teen years. I think the conferences, for teens, may  <br/>\nhelp unschoolers not decide school is a sexier option -- they have a community.  <br/>\nThey can be in touch with their community through the internet and  telephone.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhere are you? The national Live and Learn Unschooling Conference is in  <br/>\nAlbuquerque this year, and there are other unschooling regional conferences  <br/>\nscattered about, including one in Massachusetts in May.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn Baptista  <br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference, Memorial Day Weekend, May <br/>\n26-28, 2006 in  Peabody, Massachusetts!  www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":11046692,"authorName":"sahm2cody","from":"&quot;sahm2cody&quot; &lt;CXFiles@...&gt;","profile":"sahm2cody","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Newbie question regarding unschooling only children","postDate":"1138681305","msgId":9689,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRybW9rcCtwNm8wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9692,"prevInTime":9688,"nextInTime":9690,"topicId":9689,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"(this is cross-posted on other unschooling lists, so ignore it if you ve seen it before.
