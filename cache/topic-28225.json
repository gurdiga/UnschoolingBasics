Thanks for all the suggestions regarding Grace (age 15) and  <br/>\ndocumentation of her stuff. I was able to write up a bunch and use all kinds of <br/>\n things from the links and suggestions - made a HUGE difference :) Now,  <br/>\nhowever...how in the WORLD do I provide her dad (not living with us) with her  <br/>\nwork that she has done? He wants, when she comes out, for he to bring the works  <br/>\nshe has done during the time not spent with him. He wants to see book reports, <br/>\n written stuff regarding what she has seen, look at her math problems...ALL <br/>\nthat  schooly stuff that Grace HATES and so do I, but makes Todd feel like <br/>\nGrace is  Doing Something. I already have to push her to do the little bit she <br/>\ndoes (I SO  want full on unschooling, this is SO hard...in fact, I&#39;m going to <br/>\npost this on  another list too, the Unschooling with School one)...I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto School at  Home, not in the LEAST! I just feel trapped. So that feeling and <br/>\nfeeling  pressure to &quot;make&quot; Grace do written work is getting to me. Any more <br/>\nwonderful  ideas? <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks in advance...sorry to constantly be asking basic questions...ya&#39;ll  <br/>\nare quite patient with me! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren in Southern CA. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28194,"nextTopicId":28187}}
