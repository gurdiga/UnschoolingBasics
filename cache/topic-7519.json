Now,  they <br/>\ndon&#39;t tend to eat candy until it makes them sick, but they would still  choose <br/>\ncandy over edamame or celery every time.  Sometimes my kids get  hungry, and <br/>\nthey can&#39;t figure out what to eat because nothing sounds good and  they are tired <br/>\nof the same things.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy the way, I am researching enzymes.  My kids have always had tummy  <br/>\ntroubles and food issues, even while exclusively nursing.  I&#39;ve noticed  lately that <br/>\nthey are limiting themselves more and more.  They used to be on  enzymes a <br/>\ncouple of years ago, but we moved away from the chiropractor that sold  them to <br/>\nus.  The other day I was thinking that the food issue was not as  big a deal <br/>\nwhen we lived in our previous home and I remembered the  enzymes!<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll post my findings in December, Julie! <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7514,"nextTopicId":7380}}
