My daughter is also nuts for playstation.  Her favorites are Spryo and<br/>\nSly Cooper.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, for those of you who are wondering....from the post (The Whole<br/>\nVideo Game Thing...I know)...we are on week 5.  Our 7 year old daughter<br/>\ncontinues to play most of the time.  We do see some other activities taking<br/>\nplace.  She has now stopped (leaves the PS2 on and walks away) and will work<br/>\non a craft or other project.  We find this kind of sad...the leave on part.<br/>\nWe think that she leaves it on for fear we might implement some rule about<br/>\nit.  It&#39;s a safety net.  Even though we have not &quot;schooled&quot; for several<br/>\nyears.  We still had some interesting control issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe miss her.  With her new found PS2 freedom, we have found that when we ask<br/>\nher to ride bikes with us, cook, read a book, play a game...that she makes<br/>\nthe choice to play the game.  Right now, we are finding that our family<br/>\ntogetherness is suffering.  She used to watch Survivor and Amazing Race with<br/>\nus.  Last night, the premier of The Amazing Race: Family Addition, she chose<br/>\nto play the game instead.  We are a sad mommy and daddy.  We are continuing<br/>\nto support her and hope that eventually she will want to hang with us again.<br/>\nAny suggestions on dealing with our feelings about this?<br/>\n<br/>\nMillers in New Mexico</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6855,"nextTopicId":6882}}
