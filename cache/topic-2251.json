That study concluded last year and the<br/>\nreport was issued in Janaury. The report recently<br/>\nbecame available online and I&#39;ve written a short<br/>\narticle with reference links (available at the<br/>\nwebsite).<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to pass the link on to anyone else you know<br/>\nwho may be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie<br/>\n<br/>\n==========================================<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.militaryhomeschoolers.com/\">http://www.militaryhomeschoolers.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMilitary Enlistment by Homeschooled Graduates<br/>\n<br/>\nMilitary service is not often the first thing that<br/>\ncomes to mind when one thinks about the aspirations of<br/>\nhomeschooled children (even military Brats), but<br/>\nstill, it is the choice of some. Because of the clash<br/>\nbetween the sometimes &#39;loose&#39; homeschooling style, and<br/>\nthe distinctly &#39;unloose&#39; style of the military,<br/>\nhomeschooled teens without college credit hours have<br/>\nfound it difficult to enlist in the military. Some of<br/>\nthose homeschooling parents took their concerns to<br/>\nHSLDA, and in 1998 an amendment to H.R. 3616, the<br/>\nDefense Authorization Bill, was made establishing a<br/>\nfive-year pilot program to allow homeschooled<br/>\ngraduates to enlist in the military services as Tier I<br/>\nrecruits instead of Tier II recruits.** This amendment<br/>\nwas not universally<br/>\ncheered in homeschooling circles.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year the study concluded, and in January of this<br/>\nyear the study was published but was not available<br/>\nonline until recently: Final Analysis of Evaluation of<br/>\nHomeschool and ChalleNGe Program Recruits. The results<br/>\naren&#39;t what many expected. Homeschooled recruits do<br/>\nnot have as good a record in completing initial<br/>\nenlistments, or in re-upping, as do high school<br/>\ngraduates.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the expense of training military recruits,<br/>\n&quot;Attrition is costly to both the military and the<br/>\ntaxpayer--estimated at $18,400 per premature<br/>\nseparation in 1987 dollars (Laurence 1987),&quot; the<br/>\nmilitary services want to recruit the people who show<br/>\nthe best record of returning value for the cost<br/>\nof training (i.e., they complete their enlistments,<br/>\nthey re-up). It must be remembered that service in the<br/>\nmilitary is not a right, it is a privilege.  Because<br/>\nof the special nature of military service,<br/>\nrestrictions are placed on the people who are allowed<br/>\nto join.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcerning Tier assignment of homeschooled applicants,<br/>\nthe report&#39;s recommendation is: &quot;Given that tier<br/>\nplacement is based on attrition rates, the data do not<br/>\nsupport considering ChalleNGe or homeschooled recruits<br/>\non a par with high school diploma graduates or<br/>\npermanently placing these credentials in Tier 1.&quot;<br/>\n(page 51 of the report)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a homeschooled teen wishes to join the service, and<br/>\nto be considered as Tier I, the chances of enlistment<br/>\nwill be enhanced by taking college courses<br/>\nand accruing a minimum of 15 credit hours. Otherwise,<br/>\ncheck with a recruiter for the service under<br/>\nconsideration. Other alternatives are to acquire a<br/>\ncollege degree and either enlist or be commissioned as<br/>\nan officer, or to seek admittance to one of the<br/>\nservice academies. (see the Beyond Homeschooling page)<br/>\n<br/>\n============================================================================<br/>\n**Tier II recruits are alternative-diploma holders,<br/>\nnot drop-outs; Tier III persons are those who hold no<br/>\nsecondary school diploma and, unless they have<br/>\nexceptionally high scores, are not recruited.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe misinformation on many homeschool websites about<br/>\nhomeschoolers being &#39;discriminated against&#39; concerning<br/>\nmilitary recruitment was not &#39;discrimination.&#39; The<br/>\nTier II categorization was based on the military&#39;s<br/>\nexperience with traditional high school graduates,<br/>\nnon-traditional graduates and non-diploma holders<br/>\n(many of whom were probably drop-outs).
