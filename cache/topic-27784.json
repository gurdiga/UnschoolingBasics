Grace  herself is <br/>\nnot ready for Unschooling, so we have been sampling things here and  there to <br/>\nsee what interests her. At this point, she feels she has no interests  and <br/>\nstill feels &quot;book stupid.&quot; I am doing what I can to rid that of her by  allowing <br/>\nher to...actually, providing, her with, a smattering of things to try  and <br/>\ntaste, so to speak. It&#39;s been 3 weeks of that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know someone has posted before how to write about unschooling  so it<br/>\nlooks schooly. I don&#39;t have that info, but hopefully someone who  does<br/>\nwill post it.<br/>\nI&#39;ll see if I can find that in the archive area...thanks! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; by Mary Griffith (if I&#39;m  remembering<br/>\ncorrectly) was broken down into subjects, chapter by chapter -  you may<br/>\nget a lot from that.<br/>\nSounds ideal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget to breathe... and it&#39;s OK to return anything you  bought<br/>\nto make yourself feel better, if it doesn&#39;t actually make you feel  better!<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nCaren<br/>\n<br/>\nBIG BREATH. Thank you. I feel like I get lost in the shuffle on these yahoo  <br/>\ngroups. I really needed to hear from someone on this - I feel so inexperienced <br/>\n and unsteady - especially when it comes to him.. Thank you SO much! <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I really need help with the former &quot;D&quot;H","postDate":"1195250212","msgId":27785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZobDNuNCtyZjR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmNi4yMDNlNDc4Ny4zNDZmNGZhNkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27784,"nextInTopic":27786,"prevInTime":27784,"nextInTime":27786,"topicId":27784,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you been sending him anything?

This is from my daughter&#39;s father - Grace is 15 now. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;I have been thinking about your home school and my concern is your  ability <br/>\nto educate Grace consistently and over a long period of time.   So, I met with <br/>\na lawyer, talked to a judge, and completed the  paperwork.  Based on the <br/>\nhistory she would be ordered back to  CHS, but I&#39;m not sure that is the solution.  <br/>\nYou told  me you would send proof of her work on a regular basis.  I need  <br/>\nthat proof and an expectation of how often. My hope is that you can  make this <br/>\nhappen, if not I will have to file.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks in advance. Going shopping now...be back later. I&#39;m so  upset...<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27433,"nextTopicId":27781}}
