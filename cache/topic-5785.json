Certain <br/>\njobs are best left to the pros, such as, formal education.<br/>\n<br/>\n     There are few homeowners who can tackle every aspect of home <br/>\nrepair. A few of us might know carpentry, plumbing and, let?s say, <br/>\ncementing. Others may know about electrical work, tiling and roofing. <br/>\nBut hardly anyone can do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n     Same goes for cars. Not many people have the skills and knowledge <br/>\nto perform all repairs on the family car. Even if they do, they <br/>\nprobably don?t own the proper tools. Heck, some people have their hands <br/>\nfull just knowing how to drive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is actually an old argument that pops up from time to time in <br/>\nvarious forms. The most common one I heard is the &quot;Surgeon&quot; analogy. <br/>\nYou know - &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want an amateur performing surgery on your <br/>\nchild, so why would you want someone untrained molding his or her <br/>\nminds?&quot; In every form it relies on false analogies that are easily <br/>\nrefuted. Usually, simply modifying the analogy to actually fit a school <br/>\nsituation is a very effective method of refuting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the author started with the analogy of home repair, so <br/>\nlets extend it to fit the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. For the author&#39;s analogy on home repair to apply to school, first <br/>\nthe &quot;home repair expert&quot; should be repairing thirty houses at once. He <br/>\nwill do this not by applying individual attention to the needs of each <br/>\nhouse, but by instructing the owners to perform each task in unison <br/>\nthemselves with his instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Each home repair will be conducted on every house whether the house <br/>\nneeds the repair or not. The owner will be punished for &quot;failing&quot; to <br/>\nadhere to this. working ahead will be discouraged except possibly for a <br/>\nselected few owners who will be allowed to have &quot;advanced home repair&quot; <br/>\nfor one hour a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Each home repair will be conducted within the same time frame and <br/>\nthe next repair will start whether the home repair has been finished or <br/>\nnot. Any resulting problems with this will be blamed on the home owner.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The scope and sequence of home repairs will be decided by <br/>\npoliticians and administrators who have not actually examined the <br/>\nhouses in question. This will be nationalized and local variables such <br/>\nas climate and resources will not be taken into account.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The bulk of the &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; training will be in methods of <br/>\ncontrolling the various owners to submit to this process - the actual <br/>\nhome improvement portion of his training will be a few general classes <br/>\non industrial construction and highway repair.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Any tests of the &quot;expert&#39;s&quot; knowledge of specific home repair will <br/>\nshow that it is no greater than that of the average homeowner. Any <br/>\nefforts to mandate scores in this area would result in massive job <br/>\nlosses and will, of course be fought by the unions.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. In addition to the regular course of home improvement, the home <br/>\nowners will be subject to sociali... er.. &quot;interior decoration&quot; by the <br/>\nother homeowners. This will result in - at best - interiors that <br/>\nreflect the values of the other homeowners instead of the owner of the <br/>\nactual home and at worst, vandalization and theft.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. In an attempt to mitigate the worst of point 7, a counse... excuse <br/>\nme - interior consultant - will be employed to whitewash any obvious <br/>\ndamage and - in extreme cases - refer the owner to a certified (and <br/>\nexpensive) interior decorator.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Any &quot;unique&quot; home designs will be discouraged since they are not <br/>\nmainstream and therefore would make the &quot;home repair&quot; process more <br/>\ndifficult for the &quot;professional.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n10. If by some chance the results of the above results in a large <br/>\nnumber of homes being &quot;not to code,&quot; the home owners will be blamed and <br/>\nthe home repair industry will call for more tax money to be collected <br/>\nand spent to provide adequate shelter for home owners. The<br/>\npoor results will also be used to discourage any &quot;do it yourself&quot; home <br/>\nowners by offering it as proof that home improvement is too difficult <br/>\nto be handled by amateurs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, by the way - did anyone else notice that the actual author is &quot;head <br/>\ncustodian at Brownstown Elementary School in Southern Illinois?&quot; <br/>\nProbably not a leading expert on education in general. Sometimes, when <br/>\nevaluating information, you need to consider the source.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196291069,"authorName":"Daniel MacIntyre","from":"Daniel MacIntyre &lt;daniel.macintyre@...&gt;","profile":"macintyred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"homeschool blogging.","postDate":"1121969721","msgId":5785,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUwNzIxMTExNTFmY2ZjZWY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUwNzIxMDUxNDI1NWZiYjA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUwNzIxMDUxNDI1NWZiYjA1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5855,"prevInTime":5784,"nextInTime":5786,"topicId":5785,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just put a homeschooling argument on my blog site here: http://tinyurl.com/7hc5j I thought some of you might like it. -- Daniel (Amy is doing a half marathon","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2143062363\">I just put a homeschooling argument on my blog site here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/7hc5j\">http://tinyurl.com/7hc5j</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI thought some of you might like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n(Amy is doing a half marathon for Team in Training<br/>\nAnyone who wants to help can do so by going to:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint\">http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint</a> )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n(Amy is doing a half marathon for Team in Training<br/>\nAnyone who wants to help can do so by going to:<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint\">http://www.active.com/donate/fundraise/tntgmoAMacint</a> )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5854,"nextTopicId":5846}}
