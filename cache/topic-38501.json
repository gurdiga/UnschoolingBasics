Do.  &lt;G&gt;  I don&#39;t know if Kohn knows anything about <br/>\nunschooling.  My guess is that he knows very little about it.  Oh, <br/>\nhere, I&#39;ll quote myself from another list:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;someone else said:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I greatly admired Alfie Kohn for his book Unconditional parenting,<br/>\n&gt; which I seem to remember doesn&#39;t get into schooling too much except <br/>\n&gt; to say he hates grades as the reward and punishment system. So<br/>\n&gt; because I admire him and agreed with so much of what he has to say<br/>\n&gt; in his book, I just thought he and John Holt were pretty much in<br/>\n&gt; sync with each other. I was shook up because I found out they<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t completely. It might be a silly thing to be shook up about,<br/>\n&gt; but it was just one of those flash moments where I realized someone<br/>\n&gt; important in my thought system wouldn&#39;t be backing me up in my<br/>\n&gt; newly found unschooling excitement.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;and then I said:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a safe assumption to make. I&#39;m willing<br/>\nto bet that he *would* be quite supportive of you and your newly found<br/>\nunschooling excitement. What does Kohn know about unschooling -- the<br/>\nword or its ideals? I have no idea! What does he know about Holt, or<br/>\nGatto, or Kream or Dodd or Allen or Aldort or Fetteroll or Bablitz?<br/>\n&lt;fallutin&#39; grin&gt; I have no idea! Ergo, I can&#39;t deign to assume he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t sit across the table from me while I waxed on about our non-<br/>\nreward and non-punishment and non-traditional non-institutional non-<br/>\nprogram-of-studies-decreed learning path and muster restraint from<br/>\nleaping over same to embrace me with passion for my like mind to his<br/>\nideals!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Looking around the room when he was requesting hands up for<br/>\ndemographics, it was clear there were as many homeschooling parents in<br/>\nhis attendance last night as there were parents of schooled kids, as<br/>\nprofessional teachers. Kohn might not consider himself an advocate<br/>\nof &quot;homeschooling&quot;, but we do. Unwitting or not, clearly, Kohn is<br/>\nvoicing with authority and credibility the fundamental premise of<br/>\nunschooling. *He* can choose to direct his energy into a system of his<br/>\nchoosing. I shall not discontinue admiring and being inspired by his<br/>\nconviction and the depth and breadth of research to which he is giving<br/>\nair that supports the system of *my* choosing. Is all I&#39;m saying.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n..........<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to keep reading, the following exchange preceded the <br/>\nabove:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;someone else wrote:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hey I was wondering if any of oyu went to the Alfie Kohn talk last<br/>\n&gt; night about schooling and what you thought? Alisha filled me in on<br/>\n&gt; his position and it kind of shook me up. I wasn&#39;t expecting it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&lt;and I wrote:&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;His position on what shook you up? What weren&#39;t you expecting?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alfie Kohn has always been abundantly clear that his position is pro-<br/>\nschool reform. In this way, he follows, (or parallels?) Gatto&#39;s<br/>\nearly years efforts which were, pro-school reform. I&#39;m not saying<br/>\nKohn is going to follow Gatto&#39;s lead as an eventual pro-unschooling<br/>\nadvocate: what I am saying is, frankly, I don&#39;t understand why<br/>\nanything Kohn had to say last night would have shocked or shook up<br/>\nany of us following an unschooly path.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;I am not an advocate of homeschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This was a direct quote, and, in fact, is becoming the opening line<br/>\nof my K (for Kohn) chapter in my book about UNSCHOOLING.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Why, you ask? Because of what he said next:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(&quot;I am not an advocate of homeschooling) because most homeschoolers<br/>\nbring the worst of traditional schooling into the home -- with text<br/>\nbooks and work books and assignments and grades and comparative<br/>\nachievement tests.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We don&#39;t do that. Unschooling doesn&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you take everything Alfie said last night, (which I did, in 14<br/>\npages of notes, which will comprise a large part of my Kohn chapter)<br/>\nand substitute &quot;In progressive schools&quot; with &quot;In unschooling&quot; every<br/>\nword of what he DOES advocate fits what we&#39;re doing!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Alfie is a former school teacher. His platform is within the school<br/>\nsystem. His passion is as an advocate of school reform. I believe<br/>\nour culture NEEDS troublemakers like Alfie Kohn TO ADVOCATE for the<br/>\nabolition of all the nonsense propagated on the young people of our<br/>\nsociety for 13 of their formative years! AND I do not believe that<br/>\nhis choice to advocate FOR progressive, democratic, child-led,<br/>\npermissive, free learning opportunities (any of those adjectives look<br/>\nstrangely familiar?) for students in school systems IN ANY WAY<br/>\nnegates the profound merit of what WE&#39;RE doing as unschoolers!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;*I&#39;ll* pick up where Alfie leaves off. I&#39;LL advocate for<br/>\nunschooling.  (We can all do that, yeah?) I don&#39;t need Alfie to do <br/>\nall the work he&#39;s doing in his arena AND do all the work in my chosen <br/>\narena too! Sheesh! He *is* an oddly energetic little man, but he IS <br/>\nonly ONE man after all!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;From Alfie&#39;s platform, he urges parents to band together in unity<br/>\nagainst the atrocity of compartmentalizing learning (that is meted<br/>\nout on students in schools)! From Alfie&#39;s platform, he urges parents<br/>\nto stand FOR project-based, problem-based, solutions-oriented real,<br/>\nwhole-life learning (within the school system)! From Alfie&#39;s<br/>\nplatform, he compels us to create environments within which our<br/>\nchildren can celebrate their birthright love of learning (within<br/>\nshcools)! From Alfie&#39;s platform, he urges us to advocate for our<br/>\nchildren, to free them of the tyranny of textbooks, workbooks,<br/>\nassignments, rote memorization, quizzes, tests, grades,<br/>\nstandardizations and corporate conforming (in school classrooms)!<br/>\nFrom Alfie&#39;s platform, he admonishes us to not kill the natural,<br/>\norganic, inherent in being human desire to love life long learning!<br/>\nRemove the parentheticals from the above and tell me how what Alfie<br/>\nis advocating FOR is incongruent with anything we do as unschoolers?!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;*I* think what Alfie offered last night was a manifesto for<br/>\nunschooling! The fact that he is passionate about serving and<br/>\nsupporting the millions of students who will go to school, period,<br/>\n(for the zillions of reasons that families do choose school and would<br/>\nnever choose &quot;homeschooling&quot;) with his ideologies does nothing to<br/>\npreclude the fact that his ideologies remain abundantly consistent<br/>\nwith unschooling methodology.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;To be shocked that Kohn advocates for progressive school reform,<br/>\n(ergo does not advocate for &quot;homeschooling&quot;) is akin to being shocked<br/>\nthat, dunno, oh, how about that Babes In Arms sells organic cloth<br/>\ndiapers instead of spending their energy teaching people how to use e-<br/>\nbay or freecycle or garage sales to access organic cloth diapers.<br/>\nThe ideology remains consistent with a principle: using reusable,<br/>\nenvironmentally-conscious, non-consumable options whenever possible<br/>\nis a good thing! Babes In Arms supports that ideal in their business<br/>\nmodel. Someone Else might be standing in 100 per cent congruency<br/>\nwith the ideal AND be establishing themselves as a consulting service<br/>\non accessing previously-enjoyed (a.k.a. used) reusable,<br/>\nenvironmentally-conscious, non-consumable options.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So maybe what I&#39;m saying is this: as I establish myself as an<br/>\nemerging advocate FOR unschooling, do not assume that I<br/>\nam &#39;against&#39; progressive school reform. Likewise, I implore you to<br/>\nnot assume that because Alfie Kohn is a leader in advocacy FOR<br/>\nprogressive school reform means that he is &#39;against&#39; unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What he said is dead-on accurate: MOST people who homeschool<br/>\n(unschoolers might represent ten per cent of the total homeschooling<br/>\npopulation? -- said population who support a burgeoning $850m a year <br/>\ncorporate curriculum growth industry in North America<br/>\nalone) DO bring the worst of traditional schools into their home. A<br/>\nvast majority of homeschoolers *actively endorse* everything Kohn<br/>\nthinks is pure shyte about K-12 education. He doesn&#39;t advocate for<br/>\nthat. What&#39;s shocking about that? If anything, the fact that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t advocate for bringing the worst of schools into homeschools<br/>\nonly strengthens -- or should -- our resolve as unschoolers, who<br/>\nreject outright the worst of schools and schooly, systemic, &#39;jug and<br/>\nmug&#39; approach to &#39;teaching&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;G&gt;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCindy<br/>\n<br/>\nHost of Alphabet Soup: 2009 Calgary Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/\">http://www.alphabetsoupconference.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlphabetSoupConference/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":181419370,"authorName":"Michele James-Parham","from":"&quot;Michele James-Parham&quot; &lt;michele@...&gt;","profile":"elijahsmum6713","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Cindy re: Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1235839251","msgId":38603,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvYnBlais1aHNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEzMC1XNTBENjQ0QkI1RUY2RDlFMzUyN0EzOEMyQUIwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":38581,"nextInTopic":38607,"prevInTime":38602,"nextInTime":38604,"topicId":38501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... -=-=- ... -=-=- -=-=- ... -=-=- Did he say But unschoolers don t do that. ?

For example, here in New Mexico, all that&#39;s required is to register each year as homeschoolers.  No testing, no journals, no portfolio.  Some states don&#39;t even require a registration (Okla for example) or only once to establish your &#39;private school&#39; (Texas). Others require annual testing, examples of children&#39;s works, etc (New York and Pennsylvania seem to require a lot), and yet still people manage to unschool their children there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you choose to unschool find out what your state actually requires to comply with local laws, then do only as much as is required.  I&#39;ve come across a fair number of school-at-home families who do much more documenting than required.  In my experience, any time we offer authorities more info and &#39;proof&#39; about our private lives than is required by law, we open ourselves up to a higher standard and level of intrusion than is necessary, or helpful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nfamily blog my blog<br/>\nphoto blog          <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAccess your email online and on the go with Windows Live Hotmail.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowslive.com/online/hotmail?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_HM_AE_Access_022009\">http://windowslive.com/online/hotmail?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_HM_AE_Access_022009</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321243056,"authorName":"Heather & Markus Schleidt","from":"Heather & Markus Schleidt &lt;hmschleidt@...&gt;","profile":"hmschleidt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Cindy re: Alfie Kohn","postDate":"1235791704","msgId":38580,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEzMC1XNTBENjQ0QkI1RUY2RDlFMzUyN0EzOEMyQUIwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvOWYycCtubTE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM0Zi40MjU0ZDQ0NC4zNmQ5NGE2MkBhb2wuY29tPiA8Z285ZjJwK25tMTZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38574,"nextInTopic":38581,"prevInTime":38579,"nextInTime":38581,"topicId":38501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Actually glad that you wrote all of this.

Homeschooling has become quite trendy and the use of online e-schools, etc have become such a &quot;norm&quot; that I cringe inside when people tell me they &quot;homeschool&quot; using an online PS program.  I would estimate that 50% of the people I know casually use this type of homeschooling program and consider themselves homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he has the same misconceptions about unschooling that are often thrown around on this message board from people who are just becoming aware of unschooling.  I don&#39;t know exactly what your book is going to address with him, but most of the looks I get when I tell people we unschool is that we non-school.  They think we veg around the house and hope that our children learn something by osmosis while they are playing video games and eating their 44 chocolate chip cookies at 3 am in the morning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully Mr. Kohn will get a glimpse of the reality of unschooling through your book (I&#39;d send him a FREE copy, just in case :)!!  Let us know when it&#39;s done - I&#39;d be interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cindybablitz@...\">cindybablitz@...</a><br/>\nDate: Fri, 27 Feb 2009 19:31:37 +0000<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: All or nothing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Alfie Kohn has written a lot on education and parenting topics that<br/>\n&gt; can be illiminating for unschooling parents to read although I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t think he takes his conclusions far enough. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL. Just had this conversation over on another list.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dedicate an entire chapter to some of Kohn&#39;s ideas in the book I&#39;m <br/>\nwriting ... and, yeah, agree that he often stops short of what, to <br/>\nme, looks like the next obvious conclusion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think so much of what Kohn advocates is congruent with an <br/>\nunschooling life. So, I always find it ironic when he openly asserts <br/>\nthat he is not advocate of homeschooling ... until he extrapolated on <br/>\nthe &quot;why&quot; at a lecture in Calgary this month:<br/>\n<br/>\n(From my manuscript:)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;At a lecture in Calgary in February, 2009 promoting his book, The <br/>\nSchools Our Children Deserve: Moving Beyond Traditional Classrooms <br/>\nand Tougher Standards, Alfie Kohn, author, speaker, and, according to <br/>\nTime magazine, &quot;the prolific, perpetual critic of today&#39;s test <br/>\ndriven schools&quot; said, &quot;I am not an advocate of homeschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So why then, you might ask, am I devoting an entire chapter in my <br/>\nbook about our unschooling life to Kohn, professed non-advocate of <br/>\nhomeschooling? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well, first, for the unfamiliar, I&#39;ll explain that Kohn is an oft-<br/>\nquoted supporter of alternative learning ideals frequently touted by <br/>\nhomeschoolers � or, more accurately, by unschoolers. Kohn is <br/>\nsomething of a beacon of hope, an advocate of ideals, a credible, <br/>\npontificated, studied activist supporting the cause of non-punitive, <br/>\nnon-conforming parenting, educating and relationship building in <br/>\nfamilies and in communities. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;(Now it should be noted, we unschoolers tend to be a spirited lot, <br/>\ndeeply thoughtful, opinionated, independent. And we&#39;re not given to <br/>\nunanimous, point-by-point, sweeping agreement on, well, just about <br/>\nanything. I&#39;ve had my share of conversations within the unschooling <br/>\ncommunity during which this aspect or that position of Kohn&#39;s was <br/>\ncritically examined for its efficacy within an attachment parenting, <br/>\nwholly democratic, unschooling life, to varying degrees of agreement, <br/>\nor lack of. In other words, for the purposes of fair representation <br/>\nof the global unschooling community, in toto, it should not be <br/>\nassumed that all unschoolers endorse all aspects of all platforms <br/>\nKohn soapboxes. That disclaimer aside, a lot of us really like that <br/>\nKohn is using his energies � which are significant � in service to <br/>\nideals that are, by and large, consistent with a willingness to buck <br/>\nthe mainstream coma in favour of non-conforming, uncontrived, child-<br/>\nled, democratic learning lives such as we embrace with unschooling.)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In attendance at the February oh nine lecture were a significant <br/>\nnumber of us who&#39;d been in audience the year previous, when, in the <br/>\nsame room, Kohn was lecturing about non-punitive parenting and <br/>\npromoting his book Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and <br/>\nPunishments to Love and Reason. When Kohn declared aloud, this year, <br/>\nin the question period following his prepared presentation that, <br/>\nalas, he is not an advocate of homeschooling, I simultaneously <br/>\nperceived audible snorts and gasps. From the anti-homeschooling <br/>\ncamp, sneers of absolution, (`See?

For example, here in New Mexico, all that&#39;s required is to register each year as homeschoolers.  No testing, no journals, no portfolio.  Some states don&#39;t even require a registration (Okla for example) or only once to establish your &#39;private school&#39; (Texas). Others require annual testing, examples of children&#39;s works, etc (New York and Pennsylvania seem to require a lot), and yet still people manage to unschool their children there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you choose to unschool find out what your state actually requires to comply with local laws, then do only as much as is required.  I&#39;ve come across a fair number of school-at-home families who do much more documenting than required.  In my experience, any time we offer authorities more info and &#39;proof&#39; about our private lives than is required by law, we open ourselves up to a higher standard and level of intrusion than is necessary, or helpful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\nfamily blog my blog<br/>\nphoto blog          <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWindows Live� Hotmail�:�more than just e-mail. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowslive.com/explore?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t2_hm_justgotbetter_explore_022009\">http://windowslive.com/explore?ocid=TXT_TAGLM_WL_t2_hm_justgotbetter_explore_022009</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150989429,"authorName":"Jet Lakey","from":"&quot;Jet Lakey&quot; &lt;Jetlakey@...&gt;","profile":"wiccankungfu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: All or nothing?","postDate":"1235766696","msgId":38559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvOWlqOCtwYWZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5QTdBNDc0LjcwNzAxMDFAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38558,"nextInTopic":38569,"prevInTime":38558,"nextInTime":38560,"topicId":38501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Depends on where you live.

(First two paragraphs below, link follows.) <br/>\n<br/>\n **Like other people, educators often hold theories about how the world <br/>\nworks, or how one ought to act, that are never named, never checked for accuracy, <br/>\nnever even consciously recognized. One of the most popular of these theories is <br/>\na very appealing blend of pragmatism and relativism that might be called &quot;the <br/>\nmore, the merrier.&quot; People subscribing to this view tend to dismiss arguments <br/>\nthat a given educational practice is bad news and ought to be replaced by <br/>\nanother. &quot;Why not do both?&quot; they ask. &quot;No reason to throw anything out of your <br/>\ntoolbox. Use everything that works.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if something that works to accomplish one goal ends up impeding <br/>\nanother? And what if two very different strategies are inversely related, such <br/>\nthat they work at cross purposes? As it happens, converging evidence from <br/>\ndifferent educational arenas tends to support exactly these concerns. Particularly <br/>\nwhen practices that might be called, for lack of better labels, progressive and <br/>\ntraditional are used at the same time, the latter often has the effect of <br/>\nundermining the former. **<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom Education&#39;s Rotten Apples    By Alfie Kohn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/rotten.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/rotten.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nA Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.

When she brings me a &quot;rainy day <br/>\nactivity book&quot; and says &quot;that looks like fun, but we don&#39;t have...&quot; I <br/>\nmake a list of things to get at the store. That&#39;s what a lot of my <br/>\nplanning with Mo looks like - its responsive planning not... <br/>\ndirective (is that the word I want?) She tells me her plans.<br/>\n<br/>\n With Ray it looks like coordinating schedules - he has a club he <br/>\ngoes to one night a week, he has things to do on weekends, there&#39;s a <br/>\nmonthly &quot;drum circle&quot; he likes to attend and a (sort of) weekly jam <br/>\nsession at a friend&#39;s house.

Its <br/>\nnot a bad thing to offer a little &quot;more&quot;, but Only if the child is <br/>\ninterested. If not, then offerring the information is an invitation <br/>\nfor him to tune you out. Enough of that and it won&#39;t matter how much <br/>\nyou offer - it will all be white noise.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterests can be enough in and of themselves. Any interest can lead a <br/>\nchild in any direction. The natural human tendency to explore and <br/>\ndiscover can take kids anywhere at all - and you Don&#39;t have to lead <br/>\nthem. In fact, trying to lead can get in the way of their learning. <br/>\nWhen you offer physics, and the child is thinking fluid dynamics, <br/>\nyou&#39;ve blown it. You&#39;ve gained ten minutes of interest and lost a <br/>\nweek of passion.

It&#39;s kind of like feeding a baby - you<br/>\nfeed them when they express a need for food and stop when they indicate<br/>\nthey are done for now (unless one happens to be an advocate of feeding<br/>\nby the clock and the ounce measurement - baby needs to eat 6 oz at noon,<br/>\nno more, no less, no earlier, no later). To paraphrase the theme song<br/>\nfrom Cabaret: Life is a giant buffet old chum. Help your kids with the<br/>\nawkward utensils but let them choose what, when, how much.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

We are in our first year of homeschooling. We have a 10 yr old and a 4 yr old. I do relate to what you feel that if there is no documentation how do we know what they are learning. The thing I am finding helpful with record keeping is blogging. I do not do it daily we just get too busy some days. But typically if we hit a milestone of some kind or the kids find something interesting, etc. We are totally unschooling, my daughter has worksheets that I print out for her but we do not do them everyday, when she feels like it. It is hard to let go of traditional schooling thoughts and ideals. Learning to relax and see that they pull from the world around them daily takes time. But if you feel the need to chart what your daughter is doing I really suggest blogging or some kind of personal journal for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things we have done is strewing, well I try to keep things a bit organized and that is just me and something I have to work on is learning that stuff can sit out and around and just be available. We have educational books, games for the computers, we have even subscribed to Britanica Desktop Encyclopedia. My daughter gets into a little bit of everything, every day. We have been having some wild conversations about different things. Her main interests right now are anime, fashion design, cooking and art. The only time I hear now, &quot;Can I go to PS next year?&quot; is when I have gotten into control mode and tried to force learning. When one of the reasons we decided to homeschool is she lost her love of learning, PS just killed it all. I will also mention she is taking Modern Art HIstory Survey right along side me, so she is already auditing a college level art class and loving it and my instructor loves to read her responses to the discussion<br/>\n questions and has already critiqued some of her studio art projects and loves them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur son well he plays all day. Superheroes and kicking bad guy butt are his interests at the moment. That and old black and white cartoons, he just spent the weekend with my Dad (he was visiting us) watching cartoons my dad remembers from when he was a kid. Daddy introduced him to Howdy Doody, Captain Kangaroo, and a ton of other similar shows. Ben 10 is still his top but now he has a wider range of heroes and enjoyment. He comes up with his own stories based in some cartoon but makes them totally his own. His other favorite thing is to stand in front of anything that he can see his reflection and make faces. Then he comes and shows us all the faces he can make, I swear he will be going into stand up comedy when he is older. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other big thing we have had to adjust to is bed time. What we have been doing is turning the lights down, not off and spending time with the kids either all snuggled together in one room or in their own rooms and everyone relaxes. It has taken quite a bit of time but now the kids ask us if they can go to bed and usually by 10 pm. My daughter goes into her room and finishes up her latest doll dress creation and drifts off to sleep. Our son loves to have Dr. Seuss read to him and then we tell stories about Mr. O&#39;Bear, a family hero my dad created before he could read so he could tell me stories. It is very peaceful and my husband and I love it, we each get special time with the kids one on one which they love as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nTreat everyday as a new adventure and let your daughter lead you there. When we moved into our new house  a month ago there was nothing on the walls. Now they are being covered in art projects. We have a wall covered in white contact paper (ancient trailer with wood paneling so clear didn&#39;t work out too well this time) where the kids can draw on the walls. My daughter and I email back and forth all day long from our computers or enjoy a conversation in IM on yahoo. She has a pen pal that is an unschooler and they have interesting conversations, when she remembers to check email or if they happen to get on yahoo at the same time. Granted her pen pal is on the opposite coast from us so sometimes they miss each other. She is writing more now than she ever has before and is asking about grammar and punctuation and all that stuff. I keep my own documentation, I do not use anything developed by South Carolina or anything education curriculum, well not anymore,<br/>\n I did to begin with but it is such a hassle. I would rather just keep track of our adventure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming an unschooling family is an adventure and we are enjoying it. For us it isn&#39;t happening over night, so many conventions to let go of but each step we make we see our daughter&#39;s happiness increase. Our son, well for him it is the way things are and what he will remember. I wish I hadn&#39;t ever sent our daughter to public school and had listened to my gut and my heart years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] All or nothing?","postDate":"1235645245","msgId":38510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJEQTMwREQwLTFBRUQtNDg0OS05MDBGLUU0MTkwRDBCNThDQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdvNTQ1OCs0Y2RwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdvNTQ1OCs0Y2RwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38501,"nextInTopic":38512,"prevInTime":38509,"nextInTime":38511,"topicId":38501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But *schools*  <br/>\nneed plans and such because they need to shepherd 20 or 30 kids  <br/>\nthrough a year of learning all at the same time, otherwise the kids  <br/>\nwould be off in 30 different directions. The 30 directions is exactly  <br/>\nwhat the *kids* need. But *schools* can&#39;t function that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s two things that might help:<br/>\n<br/>\nProducts of Education<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhy You Can&#39;t Let Go<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; DS just sees the<br/>\n&gt; end product (maybe as he gets older he will see more).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The danger of charts is that they record what someone else has  <br/>\ndetermined was useful. They don&#39;t record what was learned instead. So  <br/>\nif there are gaps, it looks like lack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter could say &quot;pachycephalosaurus&quot; before she could say her  <br/>\nown name. It would be a perfectly reasonable question to ask kids to  <br/>\nsay their own name. She would have failed. And no reasonable test of  <br/>\nan 18 mo would have asked if she could pronounce pachycephalosaurus.  <br/>\nWhat it would show is she&#39;s lacking when really she was way richer  <br/>\nthan any test could ever test for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is that still<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and does it really matter if it works for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you want to unschool, if you&#39;re doing something that gets in the  <br/>\nway of him exploring his interests, or makes him feel his interests  <br/>\naren&#39;t as good as some other activity or understanding, then that&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething that will interfere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no universal right or wrong. It depends what your goals are.  <br/>\nIf your goal is to unschool, the more you can let go of that gets in  <br/>\nthe way of learning from life, the smoother unschooling will work.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s why people often suggest to live life as though school didn&#39;t  <br/>\nexist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Basically<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t I take from wherever works for us?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, they have a word for cobbling together bits and pieces of  <br/>\nvarious educational ideas: Eclectic homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Can&#39;t we keep track of what he &quot;should&quot; be doing at this point and<br/>\n&gt; still go with their interests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well ... there are actions that help unschooling and actions that  <br/>\ninterfere. So it&#39;s more important to understand how unschooling  <br/>\nworks, what can interfere and what can help and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas there an order of words he should have learned in order to speak?  <br/>\nThere is in Spanish class. And look how well that works!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helps some people let go of the lists of what kids should know  <br/>\nis to look back on lists from several years ago and see how the child  <br/>\nencountered all those just by living life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have training in Early Childhood<br/>\n&gt; Education (one of my degrees/diplomas) and have started and figured<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d continue to utilize that method of child-led learning / using the<br/>\n&gt; world and themselves, rather than worksheets to learn whatever it is<br/>\n&gt; they would be learning at xyz time.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That would be different than unschooling. You would be leading him  <br/>\nthrough understanding rather than letting him discover it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s scary! And yet when you step away from institutional learning,  <br/>\nstep away from the school&#39;s need to march kids through learning in a  <br/>\nparticular order, then you can see how difficult and unnatural that  <br/>\nkind of learning is. It&#39;s also not as effective. The problem is that  <br/>\nit tests well because kids are tested on what they&#39;ve memorized, not  <br/>\nwhat they understand. It&#39;s *really* hard to test for understanding  <br/>\nbut understanding is what we need to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has an interest and I take that<br/>\n&gt; interest and point out, as an example, the physics of the human body<br/>\n&gt; or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends how it&#39;s done. If mom is worried, there is the danger the  <br/>\nchild will feel the pressure of needing to learn and the inadequacy  <br/>\nof not knowing as much as mom feels he should. He will feel that life  <br/>\nis being turned into &quot;learning opportunities&quot; when all he wanted was  <br/>\nto enjoy the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, people who are passionate about a subject often  <br/>\ncan&#39;t help sharing their passion. :-) And that can be really cool,  <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re sharing out of love and they hope someone else will love  <br/>\nit too. They don&#39;t care if someone doesn&#39;t learn. They just care  <br/>\nabout sharing the joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some times we just want to experience something for ourselves, to  <br/>\ntake in what we care about, to draw our own conclusions, to think our  <br/>\nown thoughts about it. If he feels you have an agenda to get the  <br/>\nknowledge you think is important into him, when will he have time for  <br/>\nhis own thoughts? And will he come to value other&#39;s thoughts as being  <br/>\nmore important than his own? I think that&#39;s one of the top 10 damages  <br/>\nof school: kids are afraid that their own conclusions are inferior to  <br/>\nthe memorized conclusions of experts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Am I just not getting it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, not yet ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this will help. You see him enjoying some physical activity,  <br/>\nand you see the perfect opportunity to point out the physics of the  <br/>\nbody. *You* see the important part as the understanding. The *real*  <br/>\nimportant part is the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that doesn&#39;t make sense! What he&#39;s doing -- mostly  <br/>\nunconsciously -- is building a holistic understanding. He&#39;s  <br/>\nobserving. He&#39;s theorizing. He&#39;s testing his theories. He&#39;s  <br/>\nreevaluating. He&#39;s drawing conclusions. *That&#39;s* real, profound  <br/>\nlearning. That&#39;s how we&#39;re hardwired to learn. (It&#39;s the way he  <br/>\nlearned to speak and see how well that worked!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you want to do is paste someone else&#39;s understanding over that  <br/>\nprocess. He&#39;s doing real science. You want to pour someone else&#39;s  <br/>\nconclusion in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have degree in engineering so I did all the science classes.  <br/>\nSomeone pointed out that guys were better at mechanical physics than  <br/>\ngirls because they&#39;d had informal, real life experience. Boys had  <br/>\ngrown up hitting and catching and being the ball. They intuitively  <br/>\nunderstood how objects in collision moved. So when they were  <br/>\npresented the formal description, they had a lifetime of  <br/>\nunderstanding already to draw on and they got it. The girls had to  <br/>\nwork at developing an understanding. (Obviously, the lines weren&#39;t  <br/>\ndrawn strictly between the sexes but on the whole it was true since  <br/>\nboys do tend to be more physical.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point isn&#39;t to make kids reinvent the wheel. We don&#39;t need to  <br/>\nhide a lifetime of understanding from them to make them recreate it  <br/>\nall! But the point is to value real learning and real understanding  <br/>\nrather than memorizing someone else understanding. Give him access to  <br/>\nvideos and books so that he can play around with someone else&#39;s  <br/>\nconclusions when *he&#39;s* ready for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285202188,"authorName":"xandersmom0529","from":"&quot;xandersmom0529&quot; &lt;melissa.mccowan@...&gt;","profile":"xandersmom0529","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"All or nothing?","postDate":"1235620840","msgId":38501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdvNTQ1OCs0Y2RwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38510,"prevInTime":38500,"nextInTime":38502,"topicId":38501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi, I am new to this but was wondering can t we have the best of both worlds?
