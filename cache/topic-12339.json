I decided to go  <br/>\nover and see what kind of stuff they had, just because it&#39;s my habit  <br/>\nto buy cheap stuff to keep around the house JIC, ya know? So, I am  <br/>\nwalking through, lots of families there, tons of kids, tons of books.  <br/>\nBut all of a sudden I felt sad. I felt so disconnected from everyone  <br/>\nbecause none of it made any sense...I used to be those people, the  <br/>\ncurriculum was so important, and a year ago, I would have snapped up  <br/>\nall the saxon math collections, and the phonics stuff. But this year  <br/>\nI just looked at it and though how ridiculous it all was....why do I  <br/>\nneed phonics curriculum to teach my kids when Sam and Dan and I sit  <br/>\naround and make up rhyming games for their club? Why buy the math  <br/>\nstuff when we&#39;re doing real world stuff every day?<br/>\nEvery table i walked up to, I got the questions. What grade are you  <br/>\nlooking for? What curriculum do you use? I really started to think I  <br/>\nhad a mission here. I told every one that we don&#39;t use a curriculum,  <br/>\nand we don&#39;t put our kids in grades esp because skills are skills and  <br/>\nI don&#39;t want to limit them. So many odd looks! Not as odd as when I  <br/>\nfinally told one lady that we don&#39;t teach our kids, they teach us.<br/>\nI did get some books, one called Eating your Experiments for Emily  <br/>\n(because she loves to mix stuff up and see what happens, and she  <br/>\nloves to cook), Rachel got some of those design coloring books (which  <br/>\nshe is now pretending is actually Chinese handwriting), Sam and Dan  <br/>\ngot books about dinosaurs, including Sam&#39;s first joke book, Josh was  <br/>\nthere and bought himself an algebra book and a chemistry model set  <br/>\n(he wanted calculus, but I was running out of money and he agreed we  <br/>\ncould do that another time) and for Breanna we found some Mercer  <br/>\nMayer CD&#39;s for the computer, her absolute fav.<br/>\nAnyway, I thought it was a good sign that I&#39;m making those mental  <br/>\nadjustments. And thought you guys would understand the icky feelings.  <br/>\nI know that no one else does. Thanks<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12166,"nextTopicId":12380}}
