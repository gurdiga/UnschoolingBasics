You created an environment <br/>\nin which a love of reading could potentially unfold. They have an <br/>\ninternal love of reading within themselves.<br/>\nSome people do, some don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nParent&#39;s tend to take credit for &quot;giving&quot; their child a love of <br/>\nsomething...I like to think of it as bringing out something that is <br/>\nalready within them.:)  I&#39;m not picking at you...I just think it&#39;s <br/>\nhelpful to examine how we think about passions and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nKay said:<br/>\n&quot;I guess I&#39;m hoping she will see what joy reading can bring....<br/>\nsomeday.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nQuit hoping.:)<br/>\nMaybe that sounds harsh, but you might be clinging to something that <br/>\nwill never happen. Some people don&#39;t read for pleasure, and that&#39;s <br/>\nok.  Reading is a bit overrated in our country. Reading as a tool is <br/>\nreally necessary and useful, but as a hobby or interest, only ONE <br/>\nthing out of a world full of interesting things to pursue. Not <br/>\nbetter or worse.<br/>\nInstead of hoping for her to like reading, maybe just look at the <br/>\nthings she DOES love right now.  (I know from your other posts that <br/>\nyou are doing this)....but I think it&#39;s helpful to examine our own <br/>\ndesires and motives as they pertain to our children&#39;s learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to let go of all that was trained into us...it&#39;s just part <br/>\nof who we are now. But we can shush a lot of those voices and <br/>\nreactions. Examining our thoughts is one way to decided whether <br/>\nwe&#39;re reacting on parental instinct or just old tapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know when my kids want to learn about certain things (esp. <br/>\nhistorical) I get all excited inside and I have to ask myself why <br/>\nI&#39;m still valueing one topic over another. argh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8597,"nextTopicId":8664}}
