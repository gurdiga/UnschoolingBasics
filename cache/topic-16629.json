Activities may include: swimming, bocce, building sandcastles, <br/>\nhorseshoes, trampoline jumping, frisbee, bonfire (smores?) and whatever other fun stuff <br/>\npeople come up with.  We&#39;re up for almost anything.  Family baseball game?  <br/>\nBee-bee gun target shooting?  Sharpie body art? Bird watching? We had two <br/>\namazing woodpeckers in the yard today. How about an exciting woodworking project?  <br/>\nWe could really use a new rabbit hutch or a tree house!  A barn raising?  <br/>\nGreased watermelon toss?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 6 families coming and welcome others. E-mail me for directions if <br/>\nyou&#39;d like to join us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16628,"nextTopicId":16631}}
