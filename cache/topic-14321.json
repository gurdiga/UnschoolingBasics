She liked the idea of staying in a fancy hotel for a couple of days.  :-)  I gave her the option of venturing out of our room or not...I left that entirely up to her.  When we first got there, she didn&#39;t want to leave the room (she was very happy to watch TV and hang out w/ her stuffed dog), but within a couple of hours she had hooked up w/ a friend, met two new friends, and was having fun.  I think she went swimming in the hotel pool at least a dozen times in a 24 hour period.  ;-)  She even had a friend sleep over in our room that first night!  So...who knows?  Your dd just might surprise you.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nCathy    <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14316,"nextTopicId":14307}}
