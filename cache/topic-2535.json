Just being<br/>\na 1 yo is how they become 2 yos. And being 3 is how they become 4. But<br/>\nkindergarten and kindergarten curriculums don&#39;t help them be 5 or prepare<br/>\nthem to be 6. The curriculums are preparation for school. And that isn&#39;t the<br/>\nsame. Unschooling is about living in the world and learning by doing.<br/>\nSchooling is about being put in a sterile artificial world and being told<br/>\nabout the real world. You don&#39;t want to prepare your child for that!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can talk about how learning is a side effect of doing. That kids don&#39;t<br/>\nconsciously learn English, for instance. They just use English to get<br/>\nsomething they want and get better at English as a side effect of using it.<br/>\nNot because they want to get better at English but because they want to get<br/>\nbetter at getting what they want! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that extends into everything they want to do and are interested in.<br/>\nWriting and math and history and science are all tools that they&#39;ll use (and<br/>\nget better at as a side effect) to do what interests them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSend her to Unschooling.com message boards for background research.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy conference talk 2 years ago was about tools and why school think is so<br/>\nattractive and why it&#39;s all an illusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy You Can&#39;t Let Go<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this article that Sandra Dodd dredged up from the internet is about why<br/>\nschools don&#39;t work the way parents think they work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Does Indpendence Arrive?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/independence.shtml\">http://www.unschooling.com/library/essays/independence.shtml</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"radio interview","postDate":"1091687482","msgId":2535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJMVkwMEsxTU5HQ1Y4QGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2536,"prevInTime":2534,"nextInTime":2536,"topicId":2535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, Well yesterday on another list I am on (local to me) someone forwarded another email from a radio person looking for people who were or thinking","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1965709399\">Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWell yesterday on another list I am on (local to me) someone forwarded<br/>\nanother email from a radio person looking for people who were or thinking of<br/>\nhomeschooling kindergarten aged children. So I sent her an email and said I<br/>\nwould talk to her and my dd was 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo she called today and we talked for about 40 minutes. She seemed very open<br/>\nminded and curious about how I came to the decision to homeschool. Well<br/>\neventually she started asking about our day and curriculums, because of<br/>\ncourse everyone else who she had talked to for this article all use<br/>\ncurriculums. So it came out that I was not going to use one and that this<br/>\nrelaxed way of doing thing was called unschooling and that is what we were<br/>\ndoing, letting our dd chose what she wanted to learn and when and how etc.<br/>\nSo she is fascinated by this and now has asked to come to my home and meet<br/>\nme and my dh and dd and spend some time with us! YIKES what have I done! <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked to come to a play group thingy we are doing weekly and I explained<br/>\nto her that most of the families in that weren&#39;t even homeschoolers, let<br/>\nalone unschoolers and that she wouldn&#39;t find all the moms hammering<br/>\nteachable moments down their kids throats. That this was just a play group<br/>\nand we chatted about what ever. So ok she gave up that idea. but of course<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; and is looking to see how I teach Hannah anything. So I<br/>\ntried to explain that that didn&#39;t happen a lot, I mean for no other reason<br/>\nthan she is only 4 and even if I wasn&#39;t into unschooling I don&#39;t believe in<br/>\nstructured learning at this early age.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do I tell her. where do I take this interview. what points do I<br/>\nmake. how should I present it? Any suggestions? Hints? Support?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHow did I get myself into this!?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I did notice was that I didn&#39;t sound as amateurish about this as I<br/>\nfelt. You people are rubbing off on me and I am learning so much from you<br/>\nall. She asked me a bizarre question &quot;ok what about when she is older and in<br/>\na job and encounters a bully how will she know how to handle that?&quot; I was a<br/>\nlittle surprised. My answer was &quot;you are assuming that people learn how to<br/>\nhandle a bully by being bullied. That isn&#39;t a fair assumption. She is<br/>\nlearning values and morals and personal boundaries every day in her life<br/>\nright now, that will keep her from being a victim to a bully, not being<br/>\nbullied. She won&#39;t learn those things in school because the way it works is<br/>\nnot to respect the individual but to respect conformity.&quot; I thought it was a<br/>\ngood answer. Then I used my own experiences in public school as an example -<br/>\nI am no more prepared today to deal with someone shoving me down a flight of<br/>\nstairs just because some girl did it to me in high school. I still wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to deal with it now except to call the police. So thank you for all<br/>\nthe teaching you are doing, I am growing and learning and I discovered<br/>\nyesterday as I watched Hannah devour information on a Dr. Seuss computer<br/>\ngame, that I am actually enjoying being a parent for the very first time in<br/>\nher entire life. That is because of this list and all I am learning, THANK<br/>\nYOU ALL!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2571,"nextTopicId":2567}}
