Little issues were just that &quot;the small<br/>\nstuff&quot;  and I wasn&#39;t going to sweat it (long before the popular series<br/>\nof &quot;don&#39;t sweat&quot; books came out).  These were hair, clothes,<br/>\npiercings, and even language.  I decided if I made a big deal about<br/>\nthose things then they would become a big deal.  If I didn&#39;t, then<br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t.  About the only thing that I have asked of the kids<br/>\n(mostly the girls because they are of that age) is to watch their<br/>\nlanguage around other people who don&#39;t understand our relaxed approach<br/>\nto language and how some people just are shocked by hearing an 11 (or<br/>\neven a 14) yo say &quot;the D word&quot; or &quot;the S word&quot; or even &quot;the F word.&quot;<br/>\nWe also request that they use the words in correct context.  Some<br/>\npeople might think that our children are &quot;foul mouthed&quot; but if they<br/>\nstop and think about it, they probably &quot;cuss&quot; a lot less than other<br/>\nkids their ages (who are doing it behind their parents&#39; backs) and<br/>\nthey are using the words in &quot;appropriate&quot; ways (dropping a hammer on<br/>\ntheir toe, cutting their finger, in frustration over something not<br/>\nworking like they had wanted, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy big thing is wrinkles.  I hate wrinkles.  I will ask a child to<br/>\ntake off a shirt (or skirt) so I can iron it.  They realize that it is<br/>\nmom&#39;s issue and laugh at me ignoring the spaghetti spot, but fussing<br/>\nover the wrinkles.  And sometimes I just sigh inwardly and remind<br/>\nmyself that the wrinkles are my issue not their issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHair grows out and can always be colored.  I&#39;ve seen the girls go<br/>\nthrough &quot;girly pink crazy&quot; to &quot;sober dark goth&quot;  (although Emily will<br/>\ndefy vehemently that she is not Goth - she is individualistic)  :)  I<br/>\nwas never allowed that freedom.  I had to dress a certain way and<br/>\npresent myself a certain way.  I adored black when I was in high<br/>\nschool but I wasn&#39;t allowed to wear black because &quot;my coloring just<br/>\nisn&#39;t right for black&quot; and I was a &quot;summer&quot; and summer&#39;s shouldn&#39;t<br/>\nwear black.  So I have given them free range of the color pallette and<br/>\nlet them wear the colors of their choosing - and they always look<br/>\ngreat - even in their individualistic ways!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are just clothes (and hair and names and styles and piercings)<br/>\nand it will all change!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255297978,"authorName":"Dawn Bennink","from":"&quot;Dawn Bennink&quot; &lt;bennink4@...&gt;","profile":"mhbmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Putting Clothes on the night before!","postDate":"1161978471","msgId":18630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZjcwMWM2ZmEwMCRjYWQxODJmMCRkOTgyNWYxOEBCTFNDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVocmlkNCtmYnNwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDRjOTAxYzZmOTc0JDM2ZjA3YTUwJGQ5ODI1ZjE4QEJMU0M+IDxkZDRlODgyNDA2MTAyNzA4MzJvM2RiYzgxMzFxMzQ0OTA1NWI4N2RjZWViM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":18624,"nextInTopic":18631,"prevInTime":18629,"nextInTime":18631,"topicId":18610,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 6 year old spent just about the entire day not long ago in a fuzzy bat costume.

He puts a lot of thought into what he wears -- what&#39;s happening the next day, what matches (in his perception, not always what others would consider a matching outfit) -- and often he shows me what he chose as I&#39;m on my way to bed.  He&#39;ll ask if it&#39;s okay for tomorrow -- not that I&#39;ve ever said no, but he still checks with me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Clothes and hair were two battles I gave up years ago -- when Will who is 21 now, was 4 I realized it was much easier (and faster being a working single Mom) to let him dress himself.  As long as it was clean enough for school, I didn&#39;t care what he wore. I&#39;ve always figured hair will grow, their tastes will change and hair is such a big part of identity, why fight it at all?  Besides, as has happened with all the boys in my family since the beginning of time, their hair will get very curly in their teens, severely limiting their style choices, that they might as well enjoy it now.  Will started shaving his head at 16, flirted with a brief period of shoulder-length, and now wears it shaved again.  He&#39;s decided that curly hair is just too much trouble to keep up with. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n  Will (21) Andy (10) Dan (5.5)<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nStay in the know.
