I now fully expect the toy store to be a several hour venture and have come to enjoy spending time looking at everything in depth. We&#39;re mainly struggling with structured visits like dentist, doctor, etc. and also events where he asked to go but they didn&#39;t last long enough for his liking, like an open gym time at the gymnastics center and an intro martial arts class. I don&#39;t want to say no if there&#39;s something he really wants to try, but it&#39;s almost never going to be enough time if something is only an hour long. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but there are times when this is just not an option or there&#39;s a real need for us to leave or stop what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **************<br/>\n&gt; As much as you possibly can, minimize this.

We rarely have more than one thing planned for any day. The issue I&#39;m having is mainly when we&#39;re at places where the timetable is not within our control. For instance, at a doctor visit this week we had the check up, everything went great, but then we were expected to leave. They said OK, you&#39;re good to go, take this paperwork to the desk. They had others waiting, they needed the room, but he wasn&#39;t ready to go. I didn&#39;t feel like I could ask to sit in there longer. My son said he was not ready to go, tried to poke at their computer, started crying, dug in his heels, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the great input so far. :-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 5yo transitions","postDate":"1345914064","msgId":48965,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM4MTJDQUVELTk3MEYtNERBRC1BNzM4LTI4QjI5M0I2RTYxRUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxOWh0aStyaDE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGsxOWh0aStyaDE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48964,"nextInTopic":48966,"prevInTime":48964,"nextInTime":48966,"topicId":48960,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My daughter likes to do things for hours and hours. We recently went to stay at a beach cottage with her grandma, and grandma likes to run down to the beach for half an hour. It took some time to explain to grandma that doesn&#39;t work for Mo - it&#39;s four hours or nothing. That&#39;s something my partner and I are used to by now, but it was hard when she was little - I&#39;d want to go to the creek for an hour and she&#39;d want to be there all day. When I learned to plan for all day trips, things got easier. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; but there are times when this is just not an option or there&#39;s a real need for us to leave or stop what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as you possibly can, minimize this.

Bring plenty of drinks and snacks and things for you to do so you can wait without chomping at the bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo went through a stage of taking so long to pick things out at a store (lego kits in particular) that I learned to plan to bring a book or some knitting. I&#39;m sure it looks very odd to see a middle aged lady sitting on the floor reading or knitting in the lego aisle, but it&#39;s much, much better than spending the same time pacing back and forth... waiting. It&#39;s much harder to &quot;finish&quot; or &quot;decide&quot; something when someone is Waiting at you ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;It is especially a problem when a facility is actually closing or our allotted time is up.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nRay went through a stage of being really sad at the end of the day, wishing the day could go on and on. At that time &quot;sad&quot; involved screaming, hitting and running away - a real challenge if we were at an event in the woods, where &quot;running away&quot; could be physically hazardous! So we made sure to take him to &quot;safe&quot; venues on the one hand, but also to cut down a lot of outings for awhile - certainly we didn&#39;t take him to places like... say an indoor playground where if the place closed and Ray wasn&#39;t ready to leave we&#39;d be stuck hauling a kicking, screaming, hitting, biting child out of a structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If possible I try to figure out why he wants to stay longer.

Go places which are free or nearly free (oh! look for season passes, too). There will be time later to go to museums or costly play centers, if he&#39;s still interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t go to zoos and museums when our kids were little, for the most part. The both raced through them top speed - Ray pushing every button he could find and knocking down or climbing anything he could before we could stop him. So we didn&#39;t go to zoos and museums. Ray lost interest in any of those things by the time he was older, but Mo has gotten really interested in certain kinds of museums (and loves zoos) so now we&#39;re getting to do a lot more of that kind of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage of unschooling is There Is No Timetable.

I have gotten better over time at accommodating","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-805238401\">Our 5yo frequently wants to play or stay longer (sometimes MUCH longer) than everyone else / what is allowed. I have gotten better over time at accommodating his need to do that, and in avoiding places/events where we can&#39;t stay as long as he likes, but there are times when this is just not an option or there&#39;s a real need for us to leave or stop what we&#39;re doing. It is especially a problem when a facility is actually closing or our allotted time is up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was young and not wanting to transition we could often tempt him with something fun, redirect, and as a last resort would just pick him up and bring him along against his will. Now he is much too big for those techniques (not that they were ever great ones anyway), and we are still struggling. Things I try are commiseration, playful methods, negotiation, and explanation. Sometimes these work, but when they don&#39;t I sort of panic. A few times lately I&#39;ve found myself bribing, threatening and when that doesn&#39;t work not being gentle with him (that happened today :-( yikes!) because I am so eager to get moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf possible I try to figure out why he wants to stay longer. Sometimes he&#39;s got a specific goal to fulfill prior to leaving that we can address, but often the answer is just, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to go yet.&quot; Often it seems to be that feels he hasn&#39;t seen everything there is to see yet/done all there is to do, but there are places where that is just not possible! <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes he&#39;ll agree to leave or quit. It&#39;s not that he will never move on, but in general he just doesn&#39;t want to do anything that is not his idea, or on his timetable. I try to always question internally whether what I&#39;m asking him to do is really necessary and sometimes decide it&#39;s not. But when it is, then what? I could really use some new ideas and insight. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48944,"nextTopicId":48969}}
