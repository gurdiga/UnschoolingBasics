The boys (including Khalid, 7, and<br/>\nKhidar, 5) were not bothered at all by the movie.  For some days after the<br/>\nfour of them had a good laugh pretending to be scared of the tooth fairy and<br/>\ndescribing various scenarios in which she would come and get them.

There is a spark that is missing. I see that my sisters are either controlling them or ignoring them. If the kids have a problem, the parents step in and take control and &quot;fix&quot; it. So, the kids learn to quit asking or put themselves aside. Really, there are a ton of reasons that the radical route is appealing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274203513","msgId":44196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZDMTA5NEFGOUEzODQ4OEE5NTNDN0Q4RjczNUI4MkRBQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRGMjQxQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+","referencesHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRGMjQxQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":44193,"nextInTopic":44197,"prevInTime":44195,"nextInTime":44197,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... images as you are concerned about?","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1126672877\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If your kids are that young, how in the world would they find such<br/>\n </span></blockquote>images as you are concerned about?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wondered the same thing. When my 3 year old is on the computer, I have to get her where she needs to go. My 5 year old isn&#39;t actively reading yet so she relies on me to help her sort things out. I have put the games and sites that they like in the tool bar for them. My oldest will google stuff and go on youtube but she usually asks me about it first. I don&#39;t tell her that she has to. She went through a period of time where she was very fascinated with anatomy and physiology. We talked about how sometimes innocent searches can bring up stuff that is offensive. She was more interested in finding the science. She didn&#39;t want to take a chance on being offended or grossed out so we decided to use books instead. We found a copy of Gray&#39;s Anatomy for her to research stuff on anatomy and physiology. If she wants to research a topic that she isn&#39;t sure of, she will ask me about it first. Since we have a computer station with 2 computers, it is pretty common for me to be sitting next to her anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274194764","msgId":44193,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2ODAyNy42NzEyMi5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzdTZlNytkbWlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhzdTZlNytkbWlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44191,"nextInTopic":44196,"prevInTime":44192,"nextInTime":44194,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Not to be overly nitpicky, but Jason is from Friday the 13th.

As that pertains to learning, I saw my young child trying to do the same things the big people around him were doing and I considered that all of learning could be like that - finding a thing interesting or useful and trying to do it.    <br/>\n<br/>\nToddler Dylan would help me fold clothes, help me pick up toys, help me wash dishes.  A profound moment for me was when I was wiping off the kitchen table and he went into the bathroom and got a wash cloth and started wiping things.  He first wiped the edge of the table.  He was too short to wipe the top - fourteen months old - he then wiped the floor a bit, wiped his toes, wiped the side of the washing machine, and wiped the dog.  I remember thinking then, maybe for the first time in my life, that learning was such a natural thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little and helped my mom fold clothes she would always undo what I had done and fold it again.  The right way.  She sent a clear message that my help was wrong and not any kind of help if she had to do it all again anyway.  I stopped being willing to help. <br/>\n<br/>\nI decided not to do that to Dylan.  I wondered what it would be like for a person to be free to learn naturally, to have someone on his side, someone who cared more about his accomplishment and joy than about how the towels looked.   What if learning was in the desire, the attempt, the experimentation, the camaraderie, and not necessarily in the &quot;right&quot; outcome?  That was a big idea for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI started reading about learning.  Learning about learning.&lt;g&gt;    I read John Holt and others, but probably Holt made the biggest impression, maybe his writing style appealed to me.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI started thinking about how other kinds of learning might happen the same way, how a person might learn to read by being around people who read and who read to him, by seeing lots of reading materials around, by using words and playing with words and sounds. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had these kinds of ideas it wasn&#39;t a stretch to consider how a child might, with help from people who cared about his happiness and success, discover all of the things in life that would be interesting and useful to him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like an extreme idea in a world that views children as empty, shapeless, lacking judgment, lacking intelligence, lacking morality, until some adult fills them, molds them, puts the important stuff into them.     But it is not an extreme idea when you understand human learning and human nature.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you hear the words &quot;radical unschooling&quot; consider it to mean going to the root of all learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void Taintor","from":"Faith Void Taintor &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274187728","msgId":44187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwQzFDNzlBLUM0QzgtNDVBQS05MDBBLTgwQzg4QzFDNzIwM0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRGMjQyQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+","referencesHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRGMjQyQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":44186,"nextInTopic":44190,"prevInTime":44186,"nextInTime":44188,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think it about context.

So, that means that DS was going to be with DH during the<br/>\nsitting at her studio. As usual, we&#39;d pack him a bag with his Nintendo<br/>\nDS, paper and markers to draw, water bottle, snacks, etc. to make him<br/>\ncomfortable for that time. The day before the sitting, L said she needed<br/>\nto talk to me. Okay, what&#39;s up? She was concerned because she had lots<br/>\nof sketches of nudes hanging in her studio and wanted to make sure it<br/>\nwas okay that DS would be there. I just chuckled and said I&#39;ll bet he<br/>\nlooks around, asks why there are all the naked butts, and then ignores<br/>\nthem. Sure enough, they got there, he looked around, asked why there<br/>\nwere all these naked butt people pictures. L explained that drawing<br/>\nnaked people helps her see and learn about how muscles and bones work<br/>\nwhen people move so that she can make better sculptures. He said Oh Okay<br/>\nand grabbed his Nintendo DS and spent most of the rest of the time<br/>\nplaying and watching her work. It&#39;s never been a big deal - he&#39;s seen me<br/>\nnaked when he was younger, he&#39;s seen DH naked. Over the last year or<br/>\ntwo, for a few reasons, he has chosen privacy for himself and prefers<br/>\nnot to see other people naked. So we honor that.

But predictors and inappropriate imageswould top my list.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you accomplish that? <br/>\n<br/>\nI felt the same way when my oldest was younger. I was very afraid of her seeing and hearing certain things. The more we went out and did stuff, the more I realized that it is almost impossible to keep everything PG. I will never forget when my oldest was 3 or 4 and saw a picture of a half naked lady on a billboard while we were driving down the road. I was horrified because she actually asked me about it. I think it was an ad for a gentleman&#39;s club. In my mind, that was not appropriate and there was no way to avoid that billboard. I also remember standing in line at the grocery store with my oldest daughter. The stuff on the shelves by the check out is pretty racy. The conversations of some of the people around us were less than stellar. I was so keenly aware of how R rated our world was that I kind of freaked out. It led me to do some serious thinking (and rethinking). I could freak out and try to limit my daughter (now daughters) or I could share my thoughts with them and empower them to think for themselves. It was interesting to note that the things that I noticed and was trying not to freak about were things that my daughter didn&#39;t even notice. The only reason that my daughter noticed the billboard for the gentleman&#39;s club was because of the pretty bra that the lady was wearing on her mommy drinks. : -) For my daughter, there was nothing sexual about the image at all. I was the one that filtered it as sexual and freaked out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been several other instances where my children were exposed to things that I wasn&#39;t happy about. When my oldest was younger, she was playing with an older cousin. When she got home, I discovered that she watched him play Grand Theft Auto. That was way before I knew anything about unschooling so I muddled through. I had to make a choice. Do I tell my daughter that she can&#39;t hang out with her favorite cousin or do I talk to my nephew or what? For a while, I asked my nephew if he could not play it around my daughter. He tried not to play it but it was a really big inconvenience for him and it really irritated my daughter. I found out that they were sneaking around and playing it anyway. That was a long time ago. Now, I don&#39;t really care if they play it. I have talked to my daughter about why it bothers me and she has told me that she knows it is all fake. It is so fake that she finds it funny. This is from a kid that freaks out over real violence. We can&#39;t even raise our voices without her having a strong reaction. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I am watching a show that has anything remotely romantic or kissy in it, my girls will say something. My oldest will say, &quot;Mom, that really offends me. Would you please change the channel?&quot; My daughters&#39; filter for what she considers inappropriate is way stricter than my filter.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void Taintor","from":"Faith Void Taintor &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274135029","msgId":44165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzUzN0U4LUEzQUMtNDA2Ni04ODdELURFRDhBNEI0QkZEOEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwMDc0My4zNDU0Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYwMDc0My4zNDU0Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44164,"nextInTopic":44167,"prevInTime":44164,"nextInTime":44166,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"No one has said, Give your kid a computer with Internet access and ignore them. be invovled with your children.

It&#39;s a partnership. We help them find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;safe, respectful, reasonable ways to accomplish what they&#39;&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interested in.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The conventional fear is that children will choose dangerous things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That fear makes sense. Conventionally parented often kids do. When<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kids really want something and parents say no, the kids will often<br/>\n&gt; &gt;find a way around the parents. But without adult help, the results  <br/>\n&gt; can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;be disastrous. When parents are experienced as barriers,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The reality -- what unschoolers actually experience -- is that kids  <br/>\n&gt; --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;all humans really -- want to explore their boundaries to find out  <br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; &gt;about themselves, what they like and what they dislike and why.  <br/>\n&gt; When a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;parent is there working or helping them work out ways to make an<br/>\n&gt; &gt;interest happen, the child knows the parent is there to help and they<br/>\n&gt; &gt;experience the process of taking care of the big picture rather than<br/>\n&gt; &gt;just focusing on the goal.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dangerous thing no matter what kind of filters you have in place.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s the standard fear. What exactly do you fear will happen?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I know one standard fear is of internet predators. What parents don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt;realize is that predators don&#39;t prey on kids. They prey on *needy*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kids. When parents say no, parents hope that puts an end to the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;desire. But it just creates a need the parent says they won&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with. While one no or even a dozen nos doesn&#39;t create a needy kid --<br/>\n&gt; &gt;though it depends on personality! -- if the child is building a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;feeling that mom and dad won&#39;t help, that mom and dad care more about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what they want for the child than the child wants, he becomes a  <br/>\n&gt; target<br/>\n&gt; &gt;for a predator. The parents *think* the nos are protecting the child<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but they&#39;re really cutting the child off. If someone offers<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understanding when the child doesn&#39;t feel the parent does, the child<br/>\n&gt; &gt;is going to turn to the one who seems to understand.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;It takes a lot of damage to a relationship for a child to trust a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;stranger over a parent, but conventional parenting is rife with<br/>\n&gt; &gt;practices that whittle away at relationships. So much so that people<br/>\n&gt; &gt;are certain that teen surliness and rebellion are biological. They<br/>\n&gt; &gt;aren&#39;t. It comes from damaged relationships. The teen is absolutely<br/>\n&gt; &gt;certain the parent cares more about the parents&#39; agenda for the teen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;than they do about who the teen is. By that point, because the  <br/>\n&gt; parents<br/>\n&gt; &gt;has only helped with the ideas the parent think are worthy and<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dismissed the ideas the child thinks are worthy, the teen often does<br/>\n&gt; &gt;want to fight against the control just to fight the control and do<br/>\n&gt; &gt;dangerous things and want unreasonable things.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;When the relationship is put first as with radical unschooling, by  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;time the kids are teens, when a parent says &quot;Not a good idea&quot; the  <br/>\n&gt; teen<br/>\n&gt; &gt;knows the parent *is* interested in helping and they really do mean<br/>\n&gt; &gt;this is problem that needs some serious thought to work around.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;By the time a conventionally parented kid is a teen &quot;Not a good  <br/>\n&gt; idea,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sounds like &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Where is your head?&quot; &quot;How could you possibly think<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; and all the other barriers the parent has spent<br/>\n&gt; &gt;14-16 years erecting.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Another fear is pornography. A typical aspect of that fear is that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;kids will see it unexpectedly and be traumatized. That&#39;s what &quot;Safe<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Search&quot; is for on Google. Part of unschooling is helping kids find<br/>\n&gt; &gt;what they want *and* avoid what they aren&#39;t interested in. They  <br/>\n&gt; *want*<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the junk they don&#39;t care about filtered out. Just as I don&#39;t want my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;husband running ideas past me that he knows don&#39;t interest me. Where<br/>\n&gt; &gt;filtering tears at a relationship is when the parent bases the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;filtering on what the parent wants the child to see rather on what  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt;child wants to see. If for some reason my husband objected to fantasy<br/>\n&gt; &gt;movies, I&#39;d really resent if he were putting effort into keeping them<br/>\n&gt; &gt;from my sight.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;The argument is that kids are different and don&#39;t know enough about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;the world to make good choices. But kids aren&#39;t aliens. They will<br/>\n&gt; &gt;react with the same resentment and anger when someone is being a<br/>\n&gt; &gt;barrier between them and something that intrigues them as an adult<br/>\n&gt; &gt;would. What we do is help them safely explore it. Sometimes that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exploration may be us giving them some more information so they can<br/>\n&gt; &gt;make a more informed decision (like a movie with a cat on the cover  <br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt;a horror film rather than an animal film. We can learn their tastes  <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;help them avoid what they don&#39;t want and find what they do want.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;That said, I turned Safe Search off long ago. My daughter knew how to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;turn it back on but chose not to. She has seen porn pop up on Google<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Image search, but just as she flipped past channels as a kid that<br/>\n&gt; &gt;weren&#39;t showing something she was interested in, she skips past those<br/>\n&gt; &gt;too.

That&#39;s a restriction with the potential for causing conflict, depending on how mature she is. At 11, plenty of girls are reading romance novels - I guarantee they&#39;re not PG!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are 8yrs apart - there&#39;s a looooot of development that happens across those years, lots of times when one is interested in something the other finds dull, or grotesque, or scary. What has helped the most has been making sure they both feel empowered to say &quot;No!&quot; If one person doesn&#39;t want to see or hear or do something, its time to re-think. How can we make this work better for everyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle kids don&#39;t want to see &quot;adult content&quot; unless its something that&#39;s been treated as a kind of special secret (or its the only way to spend time with parents, watching the news for example). They don&#39;t want to see sex - they aren&#39;t traumitized, just baffled and bored. Its not interesting to them. They may or may not fine &quot;violence&quot; interesting - or scary for that matter. That&#39;s something that varies a lot. Some kids like animated fights but not live action. Some are fine with any kind of fighting. Some are okay with physical fight scenes if the music isn&#39;t scary (so you can turn off the volume or skip  that scene or watch with commmentary turned on). Some are fine with physical violence but hate &quot;drama&quot; - emotional violence. Mo hates any scenes that show adults yelling at children, but doesn&#39;t mind mayhem and gore. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf *you* don&#39;t want to see certain things, be clear about that - be clear about your boundaries!(but consider stretching them if your kids love something outside your comfort zone). If violence in movies and shows bothers you, say so (but please don&#39;t imply that what you&#39;re seeing on the screen is &quot;real&quot; - that&#39;s confusing fantasy and reality and kids don&#39;t need adults to do that). If sexual imagery bothers you, talk about that. What bothers you? That its unrealistic? That its scary? That it brings up personal issues? Your kids may agree, or they may have a different perspective (they may just find it dull, though, the little ones anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like it or not, with an 11yo, you&#39;re on the verge of dealing with issues of sexuality. *She* may be dealing with issues of sexuality already.

She loves Wolfquest and she&#39;s<br/>\nstarting to explore New Moon Girls.  She&#39;s played some other online games.<br/>\nMost of what she plays have &quot;safe chat&quot; - varying in strength from<br/>\npre-selected phrases to not being able to use some words. But there are some<br/>\ngames that have no filters at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to sit with her when she plays, but sometimes I need to take care of<br/>\nmy youngest or deal with the dog or whatever.

It&#39;s a partnership. We help them find  <br/>\n&gt;safe, respectful, reasonable ways to accomplish what they&#39;&#39;re  <br/>\n&gt;interested in.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The conventional fear is that children will choose dangerous things.  <br/>\n&gt;That fear makes sense. Conventionally parented often kids do. When  <br/>\n&gt;kids really want something and parents say no, the kids will often  <br/>\n&gt;find a way around the parents. But without adult help, the results can  <br/>\n&gt;be disastrous. When parents are experienced as barriers,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The reality -- what unschoolers actually experience -- is that kids --  <br/>\n&gt;all humans really -- want to explore their boundaries to find out more  <br/>\n&gt;about themselves, what they like and what they dislike and why. When a  <br/>\n&gt;parent is there working or helping them work out ways to make an  <br/>\n&gt;interest happen, the child knows the parent is there to help and they  <br/>\n&gt;experience the process of taking care of the big picture rather than  <br/>\n&gt;just focusing on the goal.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; dangerous thing no matter what kind of filters you have in place.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That&#39;s the standard fear. What exactly do you fear will happen?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I know one standard fear is of internet predators. What parents don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt;realize is that predators don&#39;t prey on kids. They prey on *needy*  <br/>\n&gt;kids. When parents say no, parents hope that puts an end to the  <br/>\n&gt;desire. But it just creates a need the parent says they won&#39;t help  <br/>\n&gt;with. While one no or even a dozen nos doesn&#39;t create a needy kid --  <br/>\n&gt;though it depends on personality! -- if the child is building a  <br/>\n&gt;feeling that mom and dad won&#39;t help, that mom and dad care more about  <br/>\n&gt;what they want for the child than the child wants, he becomes a target  <br/>\n&gt;for a predator. The parents *think* the nos are protecting the child  <br/>\n&gt;but they&#39;re really cutting the child off. If someone offers  <br/>\n&gt;understanding when the child doesn&#39;t feel the parent does, the child  <br/>\n&gt;is going to turn to the one who seems to understand.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It takes a lot of damage to a relationship for a child to trust a  <br/>\n&gt;stranger over a parent, but conventional parenting is rife with  <br/>\n&gt;practices that whittle away at relationships. So much so that people  <br/>\n&gt;are certain that teen surliness and rebellion are biological. They  <br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t. It comes from damaged relationships. The teen is absolutely  <br/>\n&gt;certain the parent cares more about the parents&#39; agenda for the teen  <br/>\n&gt;than they do about who the teen is. By that point, because the parents  <br/>\n&gt;has only helped with the ideas the parent think are worthy and  <br/>\n&gt;dismissed the ideas the child thinks are worthy, the teen often does  <br/>\n&gt;want to fight against the control just to fight the control and do  <br/>\n&gt;dangerous things and want unreasonable things.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;When the relationship is put first as with radical unschooling, by the  <br/>\n&gt;time the kids are teens, when a parent says &quot;Not a good idea&quot; the teen  <br/>\n&gt;knows the parent *is* interested in helping and they really do mean  <br/>\n&gt;this is problem that needs some serious thought to work around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;By the time a conventionally parented kid is a teen &quot;Not a good idea,&quot;  <br/>\n&gt;sounds like &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Where is your head?&quot; &quot;How could you possibly think  <br/>\n&gt;that&#39;s a good idea?&quot; and all the other barriers the parent has spent  <br/>\n&gt;14-16 years erecting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Another fear is pornography. A typical aspect of that fear is that  <br/>\n&gt;kids will see it unexpectedly and be traumatized. That&#39;s what &quot;Safe  <br/>\n&gt;Search&quot; is for on Google. Part of unschooling is helping kids find  <br/>\n&gt;what they want *and* avoid what they aren&#39;t interested in. They *want*  <br/>\n&gt;the junk they don&#39;t care about filtered out. Just as I don&#39;t want my  <br/>\n&gt;husband running ideas past me that he knows don&#39;t interest me. Where  <br/>\n&gt;filtering tears at a relationship is when the parent bases the  <br/>\n&gt;filtering on what the parent wants the child to see rather on what the  <br/>\n&gt;child wants to see. If for some reason my husband objected to fantasy  <br/>\n&gt;movies, I&#39;d really resent if he were putting effort into keeping them  <br/>\n&gt;from my sight.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The argument is that kids are different and don&#39;t know enough about  <br/>\n&gt;the world to make good choices. But kids aren&#39;t aliens. They will  <br/>\n&gt;react with the same resentment and anger when someone is being a  <br/>\n&gt;barrier between them and something that intrigues them as an adult  <br/>\n&gt;would. What we do is help them safely explore it. Sometimes that  <br/>\n&gt;exploration may be us giving them some more information so they can  <br/>\n&gt;make a more informed decision (like a movie with a cat on the cover is  <br/>\n&gt;a horror film rather than an animal film. We can learn their tastes to  <br/>\n&gt;help them avoid what they don&#39;t want and find what they do want.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That said, I turned Safe Search off long ago. My daughter knew how to  <br/>\n&gt;turn it back on but chose not to. She has seen porn pop up on Google  <br/>\n&gt;Image search, but just as she flipped past channels as a kid that  <br/>\n&gt;weren&#39;t showing something she was interested in, she skips past those  <br/>\n&gt;too.

The grooming tricks of predators work on kids who are so desperate for love, approval, acceptance, understanding that they&#39;ll take what they can get from *anyone*, even a stranger, because they don&#39;t have, and probably haven&#39;t had that at home, ever.   Those same grooming tricks seem creepy and suspicious to emotionally healthy kids.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you mean pornography, it&#39;s a common belief that every kid wants to see the weirdest of the weird stuff, but that&#39;s just not true.  Kid&#39;s who have healthy relationships with parents and who can ask questions and get truthful answers don&#39;t have the same interest as kids whose access to information about sex has been restricted.   When parents are normal about sex and sex information, kids are normal.    Sexual weirdness doesn&#39;t start with internet pornography.  It&#39;s starts with parental attitudes about sex. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you think kids should have no exposure to information or ideas about sex that the parent doesn&#39;t provide.  A parent is not likely to be a child&#39;s only source of information about sex even if a family doesn&#39;t have a computer.  I did not grow up with a computer or cable TV,  but I had four older siblings and they had friends.  My mother told me nothing about sex, but I knew plenty!&lt;g&gt;    It&#39;s normal and healthy to be curious about sex.  Sex will be part of a healthy life for many years.   Emotionally healthy people aren&#39;t warped by seeing disturbing images.  They may be shocked, or grossed out, but they&#39;re not warped for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have not had parental controls or filters on our computers.  Our son has had unsupervised internet access for years.  I know he&#39;s seen pornography.  He&#39;s even shown me or told me about some of the more amusing things he&#39;s come across.   He&#39;s eighteen.   He&#39;s never been in danger because of the internet and he&#39;s (relatively) normal.&lt;g.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274118858","msgId":44139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzOTQ3Mi40MzcxMS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJGMTlBMjc5LUREMUMtNEE5Mi1BNThCLTYzOEJFMzRGRjJFOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDUyNzEzNC4xMzQ4Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8MkYxOUEyNzktREQxQy00QTkyLUE1OEItNjM4QkUzNEZGMkU5QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":44138,"nextInTopic":44141,"prevInTime":44138,"nextInTime":44140,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-502842326\">&lt;&lt;&lt; But kids aren&#39;t aliens.

It&#39;s a partnership. We help them find  <br/>\nsafe, respectful, reasonable ways to accomplish what they&#39;&#39;re  <br/>\ninterested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conventional fear is that children will choose dangerous things.  <br/>\nThat fear makes sense. Conventionally parented often kids do. When  <br/>\nkids really want something and parents say no, the kids will often  <br/>\nfind a way around the parents. But without adult help, the results can  <br/>\nbe disastrous. When parents are experienced as barriers,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reality -- what unschoolers actually experience -- is that kids --  <br/>\nall humans really -- want to explore their boundaries to find out more  <br/>\nabout themselves, what they like and what they dislike and why. When a  <br/>\nparent is there working or helping them work out ways to make an  <br/>\ninterest happen, the child knows the parent is there to help and they  <br/>\nexperience the process of taking care of the big picture rather than  <br/>\njust focusing on the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I consider a child with unsupervised internet access to be a very  <br/>\n&gt; dangerous thing no matter what kind of filters you have in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the standard fear. What exactly do you fear will happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know one standard fear is of internet predators. What parents don&#39;t  <br/>\nrealize is that predators don&#39;t prey on kids. They prey on *needy*  <br/>\nkids. When parents say no, parents hope that puts an end to the  <br/>\ndesire. But it just creates a need the parent says they won&#39;t help  <br/>\nwith. While one no or even a dozen nos doesn&#39;t create a needy kid --  <br/>\nthough it depends on personality! -- if the child is building a  <br/>\nfeeling that mom and dad won&#39;t help, that mom and dad care more about  <br/>\nwhat they want for the child than the child wants, he becomes a target  <br/>\nfor a predator. The parents *think* the nos are protecting the child  <br/>\nbut they&#39;re really cutting the child off. If someone offers  <br/>\nunderstanding when the child doesn&#39;t feel the parent does, the child  <br/>\nis going to turn to the one who seems to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a lot of damage to a relationship for a child to trust a  <br/>\nstranger over a parent, but conventional parenting is rife with  <br/>\npractices that whittle away at relationships. So much so that people  <br/>\nare certain that teen surliness and rebellion are biological. They  <br/>\naren&#39;t. It comes from damaged relationships. The teen is absolutely  <br/>\ncertain the parent cares more about the parents&#39; agenda for the teen  <br/>\nthan they do about who the teen is. By that point, because the parents  <br/>\nhas only helped with the ideas the parent think are worthy and  <br/>\ndismissed the ideas the child thinks are worthy, the teen often does  <br/>\nwant to fight against the control just to fight the control and do  <br/>\ndangerous things and want unreasonable things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the relationship is put first as with radical unschooling, by the  <br/>\ntime the kids are teens, when a parent says &quot;Not a good idea&quot; the teen  <br/>\nknows the parent *is* interested in helping and they really do mean  <br/>\nthis is problem that needs some serious thought to work around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time a conventionally parented kid is a teen &quot;Not a good idea,&quot;  <br/>\nsounds like &quot;No,&quot; &quot;Where is your head?&quot; &quot;How could you possibly think  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a good idea?&quot; and all the other barriers the parent has spent  <br/>\n14-16 years erecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fear is pornography. A typical aspect of that fear is that  <br/>\nkids will see it unexpectedly and be traumatized. That&#39;s what &quot;Safe  <br/>\nSearch&quot; is for on Google. Part of unschooling is helping kids find  <br/>\nwhat they want *and* avoid what they aren&#39;t interested in. They *want*  <br/>\nthe junk they don&#39;t care about filtered out. Just as I don&#39;t want my  <br/>\nhusband running ideas past me that he knows don&#39;t interest me. Where  <br/>\nfiltering tears at a relationship is when the parent bases the  <br/>\nfiltering on what the parent wants the child to see rather on what the  <br/>\nchild wants to see. If for some reason my husband objected to fantasy  <br/>\nmovies, I&#39;d really resent if he were putting effort into keeping them  <br/>\nfrom my sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument is that kids are different and don&#39;t know enough about  <br/>\nthe world to make good choices. But kids aren&#39;t aliens. They will  <br/>\nreact with the same resentment and anger when someone is being a  <br/>\nbarrier between them and something that intrigues them as an adult  <br/>\nwould. What we do is help them safely explore it. Sometimes that  <br/>\nexploration may be us giving them some more information so they can  <br/>\nmake a more informed decision (like a movie with a cat on the cover is  <br/>\na horror film rather than an animal film. We can learn their tastes to  <br/>\nhelp them avoid what they don&#39;t want and find what they do want.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I turned Safe Search off long ago. My daughter knew how to  <br/>\nturn it back on but chose not to. She has seen porn pop up on Google  <br/>\nImage search, but just as she flipped past channels as a kid that  <br/>\nweren&#39;t showing something she was interested in, she skips past those  <br/>\ntoo. (She&#39;s 18, BTW.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154781355,"authorName":"crystal rid","from":"crystal rid &lt;cryway2@...&gt;","profile":"cryway2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Back to the original $1000 post","postDate":"1274107860","msgId":44129,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyNzEzNC4xMzQ4Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44136,"prevInTime":44128,"nextInTime":44130,"topicId":44129,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As the original poster I have been seriously considering this.
