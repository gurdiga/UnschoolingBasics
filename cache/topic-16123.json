I didn&#39;t mind<br/>\nhim not flushing it once or twice, but after that it really needs to be<br/>\nflushed just for clearing the air.  :)  One thing that I did for him was<br/>\nlaminated the word FLUSH (Stamped in really big colorful letters) and taped<br/>\nit right at eye level.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Another<br/>\nthing that we will do periodically is to remind him as we see him headed for<br/>\nthe bathroom.  &quot;Flush please!&quot;  And for those times that I have passed his<br/>\nbathroom and been overwhelmed, I will simple go in and flush.  One thing<br/>\nthat has helped is we purchased a KaBoom system for the tank (doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncorrode the toilet &quot;innards&quot; like the bleach tablets).  So the toilet stays<br/>\ncleaner than before even with his sporadic flushing<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, his lack of flushing is upsetting you not him, which means that it<br/>\nis your problem not his.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] For the newbies.....","postDate":"1154550748","msgId":16159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE3QTJBRTNGLUExREYtNDVFNC05MEY4LUYzNEFBRDkxQUNGMUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVhcWQ4dCtkYnIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVhcWQ4dCtkYnIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16142,"nextInTopic":16165,"prevInTime":16158,"nextInTime":16160,"topicId":16123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I <br/>\nwas sure I would fall in &#39;cause they were so <br/>\nbig!  And that whoosh!!  Yikes!!!  I was so <br/>\nafraid, in fact, that I absolutely refused to use <br/>\nthem and would prefer to either wait and do my <br/>\nbidness at home or ... well, you know (suffice to <br/>\nsay, I rarely was able to make it that long, if <br/>\never).  I had a lot of accidents because of this <br/>\nfear, and it was *very* humiliating.  (Probably <br/>\ncost me a fiancé, too; I was engaged to young <br/>\nStephen B. back then, but he might have changed <br/>\nhis mind when he saw how incontinent I was.  But <br/>\nI digress.)  Finally, after way too long of all <br/>\nthat, my folks and Mrs. Baum, my K teacher, and <br/>\nthe school nurse put their heads together and <br/>\nfigured out that they could let me use the <br/>\ncommode in the nurse&#39;s office, which was more like a home commode.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you know, as stubborn and frightened as I <br/>\nwas about it back then, I seem to have no fears <br/>\nor problems with those kinds of toilets today, <br/>\nand, in fact, I grew out of that fear pretty <br/>\nquickly, probably by the time I was 7!  I was <br/>\nbound to and I most likely would have no matter <br/>\nwhat, whether I had been treated compassionately <br/>\nor whether I had been ridiculed and shamed (which <br/>\nI was).  Therefore, (warning: rhetorical question <br/>\nalert) why not be compassionate to little folks <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re going through their issues?
