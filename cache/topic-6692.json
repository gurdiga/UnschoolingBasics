I  started <br/>\nfollowing my own passions AND  I learned to play video games.   We bought a Game <br/>\nCube and I discovered Donkey Konga and Animal Crossing and I  was hooked.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow , Logan occasionally plays video games but prefers going out  geocaching, <br/>\n hiking to look for rocks or working on robotics  creations.

I tried to assure her that it would ease up<br/>\nwith time and freedom.  They got satellite TV for the kids and let them<br/>\nwatch.  One of them was still watching more than she was comfortable with<br/>\nafter 6 months and they removed the satellite.  I tried to tell her that he<br/>\nfelt it would eventually be limited again (they had gone back and forth with<br/>\nlimits several times) and therefore he was watching all he could while it<br/>\nwas available.  I only thought they would limit it, not get rid of the<br/>\nsatellite.  He was right to watch it as much as he could because in the end<br/>\nthey did take it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout bringing the gaming into it, you could still let your dd know you<br/>\nmiss interacting with her and offer for her to join you in something you<br/>\nboth will enjoy.
