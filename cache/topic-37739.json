I am hoping that<br/>\nwriting helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never heard of unschooling until about 3 years ago. But it is<br/>\nsomething I have always done with my kids because I was damn sure not going<br/>\nto be my parents, kwim? I practiced AP (first found out about it later, kind<br/>\nof like unschooling). So I was already on the gentle respectful parenting<br/>\npath. I never quite fit in as I was not the controlling AP parent. I never<br/>\ndid school at home or divided life up into sections like most of my peers. I<br/>\njust didn&#39;t feel like it was necessary. My main parenting goal was to be a<br/>\nguide for my kids. To &quot;let&quot; them retain their SELVES and support them in<br/>\nthier loves and passions. So when I heard about unschooling it was like a<br/>\ndream come true. Other people that were on the same path. And otehrs further<br/>\nalong in this journey. I was thrilled.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere comes the problem for me. I started on Sandra&#39;s email list and started<br/>\nfeeling really about about my parenting. Feeling really inferior. I know<br/>\nthat it was/is my issue. I felt really confused about what I was doing and<br/>\ntried to change things thinking I was hurting my kids. Things got really<br/>\ncrazy and weird in our lives and within our family. I was hard and at times<br/>\npainful. I was thrilled to have found this group as it really helped me see<br/>\nwhat I needed to see. It is helping me come back around to where I was and<br/>\neven deeper place than before. I love that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I haven&#39;t quite gotten to a succinct statement about something<br/>\nthat specifically was misleading. I am still trying to figure some of that<br/>\nout. I am kind of scared to go back to her group and see if through the eyes<br/>\nIhave know I can understand what I saw as misleading. I never posted on that<br/>\ngroup, just read things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that is my little story.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks Joyce, Pam, Ren, Kelly and many others for helping me figure this<br/>\nout...<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jan 10, 2009 at 6:14 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Or the pitfalls of trying to explain unschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What are the things that confused you about unschooling<br/>\n&gt; explanations?

The result of radical  <br/>\nunschooling parenting  seems to me to be a list of virtues - the ones  <br/>\nthat stand out most to me in radically unschooled young adults are:  <br/>\ncompassion, confidence, cooperation, creativity, enthusiasm,  <br/>\nfriendliness, helpfulness, idealism, joyfulness, kindness, respect,  <br/>\nresponsibility, and tolerance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t think those kinds of personal characteristics come from  <br/>\nsimply &quot;not doing school.&quot; They develop as a direct result of daily  <br/>\nliving in an environment that focuses far more on support and teamwork  <br/>\nand collaboration than on finding balance between competing or  <br/>\nconflicting wants and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance as a goal isn&#39;t lofty enough.

It becomes  <br/>\nvery easy to automatically say no to children in the interest of  <br/>\nbalance instead of defaulting to a more collaborative and supportive  <br/>\napproach in which we assume we can find a way to support everyone&#39;s  <br/>\ninterests.

Joyce<br/>\n&gt; originally started that thread with the question: &quot;What are the  <br/>\n&gt; things that<br/>\n&gt; confused you about unschooling explanations?

(Oh, I noticed  <br/>\nDanielle&#39;s reply way down at the bottom. So I did guess right.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTouching babies was clearly something this child loves to do but  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know how in socially acceptable ways. My suggestion of  <br/>\nscenarios was not for the mom to move the child to where the mom  <br/>\nwants her to be. My suggestion was for the mom to help the child be  <br/>\nwhere the child wants to be. If the child wanted -- and she seems a  <br/>\nvery verbal child who might be able to understand at 2.5 -- the mom  <br/>\ncould present some scenarios that might help the child do what the  <br/>\nchild wanted in safe and respectful ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative, and if helping with some ideas her doesn&#39;t work  <br/>\nbecause she&#39;s just too young, is to not take her places that have  <br/>\nbabies until she&#39;s old enough not to impulsively put her hands on  <br/>\ntheir faces.<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional parents would see this as giving up. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s  <br/>\nrespecting that the child isn&#39;t old enough. It&#39;s respectful not to  <br/>\nput the child into situations the child can&#39;t yet handle. And it&#39;s  <br/>\nrespectful of other people not to have their babies attacked! Keeping  <br/>\nher away from babies for now is less stressful all around for  <br/>\nsomething the child will grow out of. If she&#39;s not ready to stop  <br/>\ntouching babies, all that nos do is increase the stress for everyone  <br/>\ninvolved.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I also still wonder if education unschooling makes happier and<br/>\n&gt; healthier and more self-reliant well-adjusted kids, and that in  <br/>\n&gt; turn lets<br/>\n&gt; them get more of the benefits of what most people would call<br/>\n&gt; permissive-but-very-involved parenting with less of the costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents are reading what we&#39;re writing and becoming hands off  <br/>\nparents, then I&#39;d say yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they&#39;re becoming their child&#39;s partner, trusting and respecting  <br/>\ntheir child, helping their child do what the child wants to do in  <br/>\nsafe and respectful ways, then I&#39;d say no.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich was the purpose of my asking about pitfalls. Are we writing in  <br/>\na way that makes it sound like we mean let the child run the home?  <br/>\nAre there other ideas that people initially think are pointing in one  <br/>\ndirection when we&#39;re trying to point them in a different direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think, yes, the writing often becomes so focused on the child&#39;s  <br/>\nwants -- because the parents are often seeing child rearing from top  <br/>\ndown management point of view -- that it gets lost that we&#39;re there  <br/>\nhelping them find safe and respectful alternatives to their ideas and  <br/>\nsometimes keeping them from world until they can be safe and respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, this is way too much to respond to one person. It would take me  <br/>\nhours. Literally. I don&#39;t mind spending that time when a couple  <br/>\nhundred people might glance at what I&#39;ve written and take something  <br/>\naway, but it&#39;s not a good use of my time for one person who has  <br/>\ndecided RU isn&#39;t for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the off list email is below.

I also still wonder if education unschooling makes  <br/>\n&gt; happier and<br/>\n&gt; healthier and more self-reliant well-adjusted kids, and that in  <br/>\n&gt; turn lets<br/>\n&gt; them get more of the benefits of what most people would call<br/>\n&gt; permissive-but-very-involved parenting with less of the costs.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel radical unschooling has a tremendous lot of good practical  <br/>\n&gt; ideas<br/>\n&gt; discussed on the lists which are generally filled with wonderful  <br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; trying their best to be the best parents they can be and thinking  <br/>\n&gt; hard about<br/>\n&gt; issues of a balance of authority and permissiveness. It is too bad  <br/>\n&gt; the RU<br/>\n&gt; ideology by contrast is so extreme towards freedom (and for only  <br/>\n&gt; the child),<br/>\n&gt; as that ideology keeps people from both the good practical  <br/>\n&gt; compassionate<br/>\n&gt; parenting and mindful parenting ideas in RU as well as educational<br/>\n&gt; unschooling itself. I feel at this point it is tragic for John Holt&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; original educational unschooling vision<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html\">http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html</a><br/>\n&gt; to be weighted down by the RU ideology-oriented email lists which  <br/>\n&gt; dominate<br/>\n&gt; the unschooling discussion on the net. IMHO RU dominating the  <br/>\n&gt; unschooling<br/>\n&gt; space discourages the wider adoption of educational unschooling,  <br/>\n&gt; since many<br/>\n&gt; parents (rightly IMHO) balk at some of the extremes of RU ideology,  <br/>\n&gt; even<br/>\n&gt; while the might find many of the RU practices are excellent and  <br/>\n&gt; innovative,<br/>\n&gt; and the key practitioners are obviously wonderful parents. So, in that<br/>\n&gt; sense, the current RU ideology is the enemy of the RU practice as  <br/>\n&gt; well as<br/>\n&gt; &quot;educational unschooling&quot; IMHO.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Radical Unschooling seems to me to be the &quot;libertarianism&quot; of  <br/>\n&gt; parenting in<br/>\n&gt; some ways, and it has some of the same flaws as an ideology:<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/\">http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/mar/14/00017/</a><br/>\n&gt; &quot;The most fundamental problem with libertarianism is very simple:  <br/>\n&gt; freedom,<br/>\n&gt; though a good thing, is simply not the only good thing in life. Simple<br/>\n&gt; physical security, which even a prisoner can possess, is not  <br/>\n&gt; freedom, but<br/>\n&gt; one cannot live without it. Prosperity is connected to freedom, in  <br/>\n&gt; that it<br/>\n&gt; makes us free to consume, but it is not the same thing, in that one  <br/>\n&gt; can be<br/>\n&gt; rich but as unfree as a Victorian tycoon’s wife. A family is in  <br/>\n&gt; fact one of<br/>\n&gt; the least free things imaginable, as the emotional satisfactions of it<br/>\n&gt; derive from relations that we are either born into without choice  <br/>\n&gt; or, once<br/>\n&gt; they are chosen, entail obligations that we cannot walk away from  <br/>\n&gt; with ease<br/>\n&gt; or justice. But security, prosperity, and family are in fact the  <br/>\n&gt; bulk of<br/>\n&gt; happiness for most real people and the principal issues that concern<br/>\n&gt; governments. &quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Overall, I feel reading about RU has been helpful. Just not as  <br/>\n&gt; helpful as it<br/>\n&gt; could have been without so much extreme ideology (or ideology  <br/>\n&gt; promoting<br/>\n&gt; extremes -- for example, Pat Ferenga said the more balanced: &quot;When  <br/>\n&gt; pressed,<br/>\n&gt; I define unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to learn  <br/>\n&gt; in the<br/>\n&gt; world, as their parents can comfortably bear.&quot;). Freedom for a  <br/>\n&gt; young child<br/>\n&gt; to make his or her own choices is an important value, but it is not  <br/>\n&gt; the only<br/>\n&gt; important value, considering the value of family, society, health,  <br/>\n&gt; safety,<br/>\n&gt; character, good habits, and so on. And by the time a kid is a  <br/>\n&gt; teenager, he<br/>\n&gt; or she is essentially beyond most parental authority most of the  <br/>\n&gt; time if the<br/>\n&gt; kid has any independence at all (like if they sneak what they want  <br/>\n&gt; outside<br/>\n&gt; the home or in their room), so obviously giving in gracefully to a  <br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; plans or wishes by then makes a lot of sense no matter what kind of<br/>\n&gt; parenting style one had. What is hard is to decide what to do in  <br/>\n&gt; the time in<br/>\n&gt; between birth and becoming a teenager.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe part of the issue is left over again from the madness of  <br/>\n&gt; schooling --<br/>\n&gt; focusing on educating the individual child as a product, instead of  <br/>\n&gt; focusing<br/>\n&gt; on building a learning community as a family or neighborhood?  <br/>\n&gt; Because as<br/>\n&gt; soon as you start talking about freedom for more than one person,  <br/>\n&gt; you need<br/>\n&gt; to start talking about balance (even just to the point of &quot;your  <br/>\n&gt; right to<br/>\n&gt; swing your fist ends where my nose begins&quot;, which seems the bare  <br/>\n&gt; minimum of<br/>\n&gt; balance needed for freedom for all).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In my family, freedom for *everyone* is important (parents, child,  <br/>\n&gt; and even<br/>\n&gt; the dogs and pet chickens) but I accept that sometimes these  <br/>\n&gt; freedoms and<br/>\n&gt; desires conflict (whether when the parents freely want to use their  <br/>\n&gt; energy<br/>\n&gt; to have the child behave in a different way or vice versa, and  <br/>\n&gt; *certainly*<br/>\n&gt; in the case that the dogs would just as soon eat the chickens if  <br/>\n&gt; they could<br/>\n&gt; get at them, but the chickens presumably wouldn&#39;t like that even as  <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; would like to freerange more). I may often fail to do a good enough  <br/>\n&gt; job<br/>\n&gt; balancing all that, but at least I accept this fundamental issue of  <br/>\n&gt; thinking<br/>\n&gt; about balance ideologically (informed by a variety of traditions,  <br/>\n&gt; whether<br/>\n&gt; Yoga, or Yin-Yang, and so on), so it is no trouble ideologically  <br/>\n&gt; for me to<br/>\n&gt; explore how to either make a compromise (the usual way to resolve  <br/>\n&gt; conflicts)<br/>\n&gt; or to transcend the conflict with a creative solution (the ideal  <br/>\n&gt; way, but<br/>\n&gt; often harder to come up with). Many of the best RU practices IMHO  <br/>\n&gt; fall in<br/>\n&gt; the category of trying to transcend the conflict, although many  <br/>\n&gt; also are<br/>\n&gt; about balance. But the ideology of RU IMHO can not think this through<br/>\n&gt; systematically, since the RU ideology can&#39;t admit of these fundamental<br/>\n&gt; conflicts and the need to think about them, even though in  <br/>\n&gt; practice, most of<br/>\n&gt; the discussions on the lists are about conflicts and thinking them  <br/>\n&gt; through.<br/>\n&gt; Ideologically, this issue of balancing freedom for different people  <br/>\n&gt; in a<br/>\n&gt; family does not bother me (although it may bother me that the  <br/>\n&gt; universe is<br/>\n&gt; that way :-), nor does the issue of balancing freedom against some  <br/>\n&gt; other<br/>\n&gt; good values bother me ideologically (even though in practice these  <br/>\n&gt; issues<br/>\n&gt; are hard to resolve, and our family may sometimes try an approach  <br/>\n&gt; which<br/>\n&gt; later feels like a mistake or an unfairness.) But if I was 100% RU<br/>\n&gt; ideologically and child-centered, having to even think in terms of  <br/>\n&gt; balance<br/>\n&gt; would have to bother me.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For, example, back in January 2008, I wrote on AlwaysUnschooled:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;So, If I&#39;m willing to go 99.9% of the way, can you consider going<br/>\n&gt; the other 0.1% to say, yes with a young child and a serious problem,<br/>\n&gt; behavior techniques may have some merit in at least in thinking about<br/>\n&gt; the patterns of reinforcement and feedback loops, even if behavioral<br/>\n&gt; approaches should never be a first way or only to think about an issue<br/>\n&gt; for RUers with young children?&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And another Pat (wuweimama, not Farenga) wrote: &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And really, that does seem like the RU ideological sentiment.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For me, that ideological extremism sums up one big problem with RU  <br/>\n&gt; ideology.<br/>\n&gt; Again, much of the practice is wonderful -- and Pat (wuweimama) is  <br/>\n&gt; obviously<br/>\n&gt; a wonderful parent full of enormously useful advice and cares  <br/>\n&gt; deeply about<br/>\n&gt; children and making the world a better place. But there is a gap  <br/>\n&gt; between<br/>\n&gt; practice and ideology in posts by many people on these lists. A big  <br/>\n&gt; gap. And<br/>\n&gt; part of that gap IMHO has to do with thinking about balance, and  <br/>\n&gt; part of it<br/>\n&gt; has to do with thinking about parenting styles and how different  <br/>\n&gt; parenting<br/>\n&gt; styles may be more or less appropriate for different mixes of  <br/>\n&gt; parent and<br/>\n&gt; child personalities in a family.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I like Ursula K Le Guin so much as an author because she is able to<br/>\n&gt; move beyond a notion of good versus evil in her stories to an idea  <br/>\n&gt; of people<br/>\n&gt; looking for balance (like the wizards in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;). I  <br/>\n&gt; did a<br/>\n&gt; search earlier and found only 17 emails out of a recent 13000 or so on<br/>\n&gt; Unschooling Basics list include the word &quot;balance&quot; in the body, and  <br/>\n&gt; another<br/>\n&gt; two dozen or so have &quot;balance&quot; in the title from two threads. But,  <br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; clearly shows, like with only 26 emails with &quot;permissive&quot; in the body,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;balance&quot; is apparently not a topic much on radical unschoolers  <br/>\n&gt; minds. And<br/>\n&gt; that makes me wonder about radical unschooling as a life philosophy,<br/>\n&gt; because, for example, Koyaanisqatsi is a movie and an idea with  <br/>\n&gt; some meaning<br/>\n&gt; for me:<br/>\n&gt;    &quot;Koyaanisqatsi: a Hopi Indian word meaning &quot;life out of balance.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n&gt;    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/films/koyaanisqatsi.php\">http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/films/koyaanisqatsi.php</a><br/>\n&gt;    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also have trouble with a style of parenting and education that  <br/>\n&gt; conflicts<br/>\n&gt; with the basic ideas in, say, Yoga, which my wife practices.<br/>\n&gt;    <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Yoga+balance\">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Yoga+balance</a><br/>\n&gt; The first link there: &quot;Join us at Yoga Balance where our intention  <br/>\n&gt; is to<br/>\n&gt; provide yoga classes that create healthy bodies, peaceful minds and  <br/>\n&gt; joyful<br/>\n&gt; spirits.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Still, I did a search just now for &quot;balance&quot; in AlwaysUnschooled,  <br/>\n&gt; and got<br/>\n&gt; more matches. So, clearly, for younger kids, these balance issues  <br/>\n&gt; are talked<br/>\n&gt; about some. But in glancing at some replies at random, in many the  <br/>\n&gt; word<br/>\n&gt; balance is used incidentally, or it&#39;s a mention of balance but not a<br/>\n&gt; discussion of it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Perhaps seeking balance is just not unschooling in any way? Can&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; quality<br/>\n&gt; compassionate childhood education be a balance of the interests of the<br/>\n&gt; parent and the interests of the child? Can one even imagine a happy  <br/>\n&gt; family<br/>\n&gt; where the interests of both parent and child are not respected to some<br/>\n&gt; degree in some sort of balance?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve tried to follow Danielle&#39;s advice below to read more  <br/>\n&gt; and post<br/>\n&gt; less (I&#39;ve not posted at all anymore to those two lists, actually).  <br/>\n&gt; The best<br/>\n&gt; I can suggest in return is to take a long hard look at the links  <br/>\n&gt; above and<br/>\n&gt; think deeply about what those ideas about parenting style and  <br/>\n&gt; balance mean<br/>\n&gt; to crafting a more workable RU ideology (even if the RU practices  <br/>\n&gt; described<br/>\n&gt; on the lists are generally great ideas in most cases).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d suggest that if you both want the unschooling movement to go  <br/>\n&gt; forward, as<br/>\n&gt; Joyce is asking about in the &quot;Unschooling pitfalls&quot; thread, you  <br/>\n&gt; discuss<br/>\n&gt; ideas like &quot;permissive&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; more, and think hard on how  <br/>\n&gt; those<br/>\n&gt; ideas fit or don&#39;t fit into RU ideology and practice. I&#39;ve been  <br/>\n&gt; posting some<br/>\n&gt; ideas on those in another list (FUNNY, coincidence?) which is no  <br/>\n&gt; longer<br/>\n&gt; explicitly an RU list, in hopes of moving unschooling forward,  <br/>\n&gt; especially<br/>\n&gt; since at this point I don&#39;t even want to use the unschooling term  <br/>\n&gt; myself<br/>\n&gt; since it seems to get really bad reactions (more from the RU parenting<br/>\n&gt; connotations and people&#39;s experiences of families that call themselves<br/>\n&gt; radical unschoolers than the educational connotations of educational<br/>\n&gt; unschooling which are generally easy to get people to accept these  <br/>\n&gt; days with<br/>\n&gt; the internet for learning on demand etc.). I hope maybe the two of you<br/>\n&gt; talking together (along with Pat and others) can for yourselves  <br/>\n&gt; think about<br/>\n&gt; these issues and improve both the educational unschooling movement  <br/>\n&gt; and RU<br/>\n&gt; movement for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I won&#39;t trouble you more on this issue. I&#39;m also not posting this  <br/>\n&gt; to either<br/>\n&gt; list so you don&#39;t have to think about whether you need to moderate  <br/>\n&gt; it. And<br/>\n&gt; feel free to kick me out of the lists if you want for sending this  <br/>\n&gt; to you,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve basically moved beyond RU in my own parenting, although I have  <br/>\n&gt; enjoyed<br/>\n&gt; both lists and learned a lot from them, and I appreciate all the  <br/>\n&gt; time that<br/>\n&gt; both of you have put into those lists.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the best in success with your lists and improving RU ideology.  <br/>\n&gt; You are<br/>\n&gt; both doing important stuff there, and I know you are all trying to  <br/>\n&gt; be the<br/>\n&gt; best parents and child-advocates you can, and that&#39;s a great thing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --Paul Fernhout<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Danielle Conger wrote to AlwaysUnschooled (1/7/08):<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Paul D.

We don&#39;t leave the house <br/>\nvery often right now because she has made the connection between outside (lots of rules <br/>\nand no&#39;s) and at home (lots of yesses and fun).  She wants to pick up a newborn, touch <br/>\ntheir face when the mother isn&#39;t comfortable with it, I say no.  She wants to open the toys <br/>\nin the store so she can look at them, I say not right now.  She adopts a friend&#39;s toy and I <br/>\nsay no, she can&#39;t take it home.  It&#39;s not our house and she wants to open drawers and take <br/>\nout tools.   She wants to nurse while watching her movie in our uncomfortable chair when I <br/>\nsuggest nursing in the bed while watching said movie.  We&#39;re out on our way somewhere <br/>\nfor a commitment and she&#39;s all of a sudden set on going somewhere else. Says her cough <br/>\nis gone because she&#39;s not coughing at the moment, and it&#39;s fine to go play at a friend&#39;s <br/>\nhouse who doesn&#39;t want to catch a cold and I say no.  When I do say no, I always suggest <br/>\nan alternative, ask if she has any ideas on what else would she could do instead.  She <br/>\nlaughs and says &#39;no I don&#39;t&#39; and goes on asking for what she wants.  She&#39;s a kid who <br/>\nknows exactly what she wants, exactly -- it&#39;s a blessing mostly and a curse in these <br/>\nsituations.  Sometimes she reluctantly agrees on an alternative, but very reluctantly.   I&#39;m a <br/>\nvery flexible person, nothing bugs me pretty much but I know that&#39;s not how it is in the <br/>\nrest of the world and I accept that there are social rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs she just too young to be out in stores, around babies, friend&#39;s toys, not to understand <br/>\nthat it hurts my back when she nurses for hours in a bad chair?  Her good/overwhelmed <br/>\nmood change is very quick -- if we&#39;re out of the house for an hour it&#39;s too long unless <br/>\nwe&#39;re at an unschooler&#39;s home where the atmosphere is closer to that of home.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does a mom do with a very little person who would rather be a hermit than follow <br/>\nsocial conventions?  It&#39;s a control issue, I can see that, so how do you help a kid feel happy <br/>\nand not out of control without saying &quot;no&quot; and without saying &#39;yes&#39; too much?  Is there a <br/>\ngolden ratio of yesses to no&#39;s? :)  As I&#39;m typing this some answers are coming to me all by <br/>\nthemselves, but what&#39;s a radical unschooler&#39;s explanation for this type of situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting the question!<br/>\nYelena<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or the pitfalls of trying to explain unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are the things that confused you about unschooling  <br/>\n&gt; explanations?

I like the ideas but was confused on what a &quot;monkey platter&quot; is, how to say &quot;no&quot; helpfully, get him to help around the house...
