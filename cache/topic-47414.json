I absolutely love Roblox and I am a big fan.<br/>\nHe has moved on  and only rarely played lately but he is mario555555.<br/>\nThere is so much learning in Roblox! and many other games. Check out some great Roblox videos on YouTube too.<br/>\nI still write sometimes &quot;OH NOES&quot; because of Roblox and our dog name is Bloxie!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I do have a question though, regarding PC use.

He started up the PC this morning, and after a couple of hours, I reminded him of how his eyes had hurt the day before, and he came off.

For someone who I used to nag to even take his own plate out, this is huge!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I&#39;d thanked him, I asked him why he decided to do it, and he replied &quot;because I&#39;m happy, and I want to make you all feel it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to stick this in my journal to go back to on a bleaker day, because I want to remember it forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also loved talking to my children, and finding out what makes them tick....I&#39;ll confess right now that I&#39;d never taken so much time to just talk to them.
