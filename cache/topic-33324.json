At 4 <br/>\nyears old, he doesn&#39;t scream as much anymore. He does still run away <br/>\nfrom the toilet being flushed and hide sometimes when people he knows <br/>\nwell talk to him. He does scream about his baby brother touching him <br/>\nor his things a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had a pediatrician once tell me he had SID or SPD (all because he <br/>\nwould scream every time I wiped his butt after a poop) and referred us <br/>\nto OT.

Embrace it and enjoy it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you are saying Kelly.  These are all labels that aren&#39;t necessarily good for parents or children.  You didn&#39;t rain on my parade because I wasn&#39;t parading a &quot;gifted&quot; label for my children.  ALL children CAN be over excitable (which is also what the article says) not just gifted children.  I have always known that my kids are over excitable and for the most part this has been a very positive trait in their lives.  I started looking for more tools to help them since their excitability has started to affect their relationships with others.  I have been reading lots of different books for ideas (&quot;The Explosive Child&quot; and others).  I have gotten ideas from many of these books, but there were specific things in this article that made so much sense to me.  For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Over excitabilities are inborn intensities indicating a heightened ability to respond to stimuli.&quot;  (I thought, &quot;Oh, so I haven&#39;t CAUSED them to be over excitable, but all of the stimuli that I provide (intentionally or not), they are responding to them at a heightened level.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;One who manifests several forms of over excitability, sees reality in a different, stronger and more multi sided manner.&quot; (I thought, &quot;Oh, so this might be why my oldest son reacts so strongly to something that we think is so minor-he actually sees more sides to a problem.&quot;  I need to help him talk out all of the angles that he sees in his head.  This can also be a real positive for him-he makes connections that I would have NEVER thought of.  It blows us all away sometimes.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing emotionally tense causes impulsiveness.  (I thought, &quot;Oh, so my youngest sons hitting issue isn&#39;t really a hitting issue, it&#39;s an issue of being emotionally tense and I need to help him release his tension.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren high in Emotional OE� are often accused of &quot;overreacting.&quot;  (My husband needed to read THIS!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best part of the article for me was to see that what I thought about my children already and what I was doing already was on the right path for them.  I felt the same way when I stumbled on attachment parenting and unschooling.  It was like a sigh of relief and a renewed confidence.  I remember stumbling upon attachment parenting and thinking, &quot;you mean other people sleep with their kids?  other people like their kids and want to be around them? there are other people dealing with the same issues as me?&quot;  And when I first heard of unschooling I remember thinking, &quot;what, this really exists?  you mean there are other people doing what I have fantasized about?  there are actually people that trust their kids?&quot;  And when I stumbled upon RU, I thought, &quot;there are people that don&#39;t try to control their kids?  I&#39;m not the only one that thinks that joy is more important than housework and forcing your kids to do things?  there are other people that live<br/>\n their lives according to what they are interested in at the time?&quot;  And when I stumbled on this article, I thought, &quot;so I haven&#39;t just made this up?  there are other people dealing with what I&#39;m dealing with?  it&#39;s not my fault that my kids are having trouble with their relationships? there are actually things that I can do better?&quot;  When Ren said in an earlier post that this is a HUGE topic, too much for this list, I started looking for more ideas.  I do embrace and enjoy who my children are, but again, I am trying to help them with their relationships with others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure Kelly that you were picking on the &quot;gifted&quot; label, and I can&#39;t say that I blame you.  This label and others are not good for children if the parent is not in touch with their child and allows this label to define the child.  I am not using &quot;over excitability&quot; to define my children, but rather to identify a trait in my children that I want to help them use as a strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeanette<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n. <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155541138,"authorName":"Gillian Goddard","from":"Gillian Goddard &lt;gilliangoddard@...&gt;","profile":"gilliangoddard","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Emotions and feelings was Wanting to be radical, lol.","postDate":"1212409154","msgId":33412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVCM0E1QjI0LUI3NEUtNDBCNi1BRkI3LTUyNzBDMTI5QkEyQUB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33403,"nextInTopic":33419,"prevInTime":33411,"nextInTime":33413,"topicId":33324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There is a school in Trinidad that has a sign painted on its wall and it says: All children are gifted.

I found an article on over excitability.  The article happens to be on a gifted children website (they say that over excitability is common in gifted children, but that it can occur even if the child is not gifted-whatever that means) and it describes both of my boys to a tee!  I feel so much better knowing that there are other parents that deal with what I deal with.  I LOVE most aspects of my children&#39;s excitability because it brings soooo much joy to them, to me, to all who know them.  However, it has really been hard to deal with the times that they can&#39;t set their excitability aside out of respect for others.  It&#39;s like when it&#39;s turned on there is no adjusting it.  This is what I&#39;m struggling with and need some input.

In a <br/>\nsense, he&#39;s right. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am writing at 3 am because I have been dwelling on this while lying in bed.  I came downstairs to read e-mail and you wrote exactly what I have been thinking (and I think my husband has been thinking too!).  I started reading a book called &quot;The Power of Purpose&quot; tonight and even though the book is obviously meant for adults, I started making connections between things I was reading and unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that someone else has read the book and can understand where I am going with this thought, but for those of you that haven&#39;t this is the jist:  There are (according to the author) three levels of thinking:  1)How do I feel? 2)How do others see me? 3)How can I help others?  The author thinks that &quot;successful&quot; people are at level three (mostly).  I was thinking that I am spending too much time and energy helping my kids with the level one thinking and that their feelings are dominating them too much.  I think I have finally figured out what my mom has been meaning when she says to me (about my siblings and I), &quot;I just didn&#39;t pay so much attention to you (I think she means our emotions) when you were kids.&quot;  I think we just moved through and past our emotions without them being such a HUGE deal.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, my mom and I are very emotional people, but I guess that the moments where my emotions would overtake me were weekly at the MOST.  My<br/>\nkids are melting down multiple times each day and it seems to be getting worse not better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pleased with how I handled this situation:  This morning my 5 yo was so upset (think tantrum) because my husband was taking my 3yo fishing.  He really wanted to be with his daddy and we tried to come to a compromise, but he was irrational (he did not want to go fishing).  Finally, my husband left and instead of doing my usual &quot;talk it out&quot; (think feelings talk), I walked him to the car.  All the while he was saying no, I don&#39;t want to go anywhere, but he was gently holding my hand and coming along.  He calmed down in the car.  We went to get some lunch and then stopped at the store and bought some treats.  When we got back to the car he said, &quot;I feel so much better now&quot; (he hadn&#39;t even eaten yet).  And on the way home we talked about his daddy needing his &quot;love bucket&quot; filled and how my son felt jealous.  These were all things that he brought up.  When he got home he wanted to wrap a gift (some of the treats that we got) for his daddy and draw him<br/>\na picture.  I think that this scenario was much better than others because I helped him move past the initial feelings, forget about it, and then revisit the feelings later.  I want to continue in this direction with him.  I don&#39;t want to discount his feelings, I just want to help him to not allow feelings to overtake him.  My younger son is the same way with feelings, but he seems to overreact with anger while the older son overreacts with a &quot;poor me&quot; attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that I am worried that I am &quot;making them more emotional&quot; and not doing the right things to help them &quot;snap out of it&quot; so that they can see things more realistically.

I don&#39;t think we need to help anyone &quot;snap out of it&quot;<br/>\nso to speak, yet I do have a child that can be &quot;fed&quot; with overwhelming<br/>\nemotions and energy if it&#39;s not handled well. Sometimes we need to<br/>\njust keep moving forward with something and not &quot;feed&quot; that intensity<br/>\nhe&#39;s feeling so that he CAN cope with it in some manner. Sometimes we<br/>\nneed to just let him be so he can shut down or BE intense. It&#39;s such<br/>\nan &quot;it depends&quot; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while I wouldn&#39;t encourage parents to try and move someone past an<br/>\nemotion, I DO understand how some people can have their fear or anger<br/>\nfueled if you keep talking about it in the moment. It&#39;s a fine balance<br/>\nsometimes and this is where your understanding and empathy for your<br/>\nchild and their unique personality plays into what will be best in<br/>\nthat situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many times I think parents are uncomfortable with the<br/>\nintensity of emotion and we need to just learn how to be comfortable<br/>\nwith it and let it wash over us without getting fueled up or feeling<br/>\nlike we need to &quot;fix&quot; anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304745245,"authorName":"Judy R","from":"&quot;Judy R&quot; &lt;jroberts@...&gt;","profile":"jlouiser","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]Emotions and feelings was Wanting to be radical, lol.","postDate":"1212334760","msgId":33342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBCQUIyQzJFQThFNDQwQzBCNERBODc5Q0UxODhGMzAwQGp1ZHlQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUxNDI1MC43NDU3Ny5xbUB3ZWIzNTQwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDUxNDI1MC43NDU3Ny5xbUB3ZWIzNTQwMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33324,"nextInTopic":33344,"prevInTime":33341,"nextInTime":33343,"topicId":33324,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s such a delicate balance, isn t it?

And sometimes you don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve done the *right* thing until later - sometimes *way* later.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my girls was like this too - and for her, what you are describing did often help to get over the overwhelming feelings that her tantrums were being fueled by - she is 13 1/2 now, and it only rarely happens, but it did happen once last summer at camp - they were going to move her to another cabin at the break, into a cabin with older girls that she knew and loved from the last year - but still she freaked...until she was actually in the cabin and then she was over it almost instantly - but nothing I said to her previously would penetrate that, I guess it is almost *fear* of change or of anything different.  I think you may be right that with *some* children anyway, you may be doing them a favour to set it up so that the emotional thing is gotten through quickly.  And you can&#39;t always do it perfectly - they are very unpredictable about what is going to send them off, right?  Anyway, sounds like it all turned out beautifully in the end.
