He chose this because he wanted to play it safe<br/>\nso he could re-enter high school if he wanted and still be up to date<br/>\nwith his credits. After about 4 months he realized that he loved being<br/>\non his own and wanted to take the high school proficency exam and be<br/>\ndone with it completely.He took the test in July, passed and is now<br/>\ntaking 2 classes at Santa Monica Community College...drawing and<br/>\npsychology. He has a part time job and has loads of friends. He is so<br/>\nhappy now...still decompressing from 10 years of public<br/>\nschooling...ugh. He has blossomed and loves to sleep!<br/>\nIt has been an amazing process to watch. I have trust that he will<br/>\nfind his way...more trust now than I would have when he was in school<br/>\nbecause I could not help but be affected by all of the scores, grades,<br/>\ncollege pressure, competition, etc.Now he is free to take any class he<br/>\nwants at SMC, online, etc. If he wants to go to college it seems to be<br/>\na much easier route to go to community college first and then<br/>\ntransfer. He has friends from all walks of life as far as schooling<br/>\ngoes(private, public)...they all seem pretty bored for the most part.<br/>\nIf I can help you in any way let me know! If you don&#39;t already own a<br/>\ncopy of The Teenage Liberation Handbook, get it!
