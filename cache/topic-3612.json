She&#39;s a math teacher in a private high<br/>\nschool and all of her children are geniuses who have had much<br/>\neducation and hold Ph. D&#39;s. She was recommending the Saxon math books<br/>\nto me for Tyler and I was enjoying hearing about her experiences<br/>\nworking with the books. When she asked me if we would use them at<br/>\nhome, I answered that we would probably buy a set at some time in the<br/>\nfuture, but that right now we&#39;re just working on finding a rhythm<br/>\ntogether and seeing where life would take us without the constraints<br/>\nof hard-core academics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought my mother&#39;s head was going to blow off. She didn&#39;t say<br/>\nanything, but her eyes were rolling around like a spooked horse&#39;s. I<br/>\nknow she was embarrassed to have me speaking this way in front of her<br/>\nuber-educated friend. When I brought it up to her later, she hemmed<br/>\nand hawed and said that *well, it&#39;s different. I come from a very<br/>\nstructured background. I really believe education is important and I&#39;m<br/>\nconcerned that Tyler won&#39;t be able to get into college when it&#39;s time<br/>\nbecause he hasn&#39;t had any of the subjects he needs to get in.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked her what she was doing with the college she had. Her answer is<br/>\nthe same as mine. Nothing. Except maybe wishing she still had that<br/>\nmoney in the bank!<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned that I thought it possible to prepare for college when the<br/>\ntime comes, and that if it&#39;s a choice he wants to make that he&#39;ll look<br/>\nat what&#39;s necessary (with my help Mom, I won&#39;t be leaving him without<br/>\nany guidance!) and will tackle whatever<br/>\nreading/testing/writing/studying he has to, because he wants to. But I<br/>\nalso said that he may not want to go to college and if that&#39;s the<br/>\ncase, he won&#39;t have been force-fed a ton of information that means<br/>\nabsolutely nothing to him or his life and made him feel inadequate or<br/>\ndumb the way I felt through much of my schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she went on to mention a report she&#39;d seen on the news (her<br/>\nbible) talking about how most of the tech jobs in this country are<br/>\nbeing out-sourced and that college is becoming unaffordable for the<br/>\naverage American. The job sector that will grow is the service sector<br/>\nand people are needing to have a lot of creative energy and strong<br/>\nsense of independence and self-worth to create specialized services<br/>\nthat will pay well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next question to my mother? Do you think they&#39;re teaching that in school?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this week I will make an effort to remember this conversation<br/>\nwhenever my fear and doubt bonk me over the head and make me run<br/>\naround in my life like my mother&#39;s spooked horse!.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
