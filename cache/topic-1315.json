If you want to turn this into an interesting experiment, you can cook beats, or juice carrots, you can use spinach for green.  Use a little peroxide and shampoo along with the juice of whatever you use, and just shampoo in and rinse out.  Since your daughter is little, just use the regular peroxide, don&#39;t buy the 17 volume stuff.  Then, use a good conditioner.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter loves the spray paint kind and it&#39;s so easy, and easy to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting, once we start allowing our children to be autonomous, there&#39;s no stopping them.

Today one called and I talked to her","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-499436107\">I am a rare girl who does not enjoy talking on the phone much. But <br/>\nthere are exceptions, and one is when friends need me. Today one <br/>\ncalled and I talked to her as I cleaned house and even vacumed. The <br/>\nproblem is, while I was doing that my daugher and my roomates son <br/>\nboth almost 5 years old where in my daughters room playing. I kept <br/>\nchecking in on them, I had asked them to clean the room up a little <br/>\nbut it was no biggie that they desided playing was better for them <br/>\nat the time. Tired and stressed and worried about friends I sit down <br/>\non the couch, hang up the phone, close my eyes and breath trying to <br/>\ntell myself it could be worse. My roomate is in the hospital because <br/>\nof uncontrolable asmah (sp?) and another friend is getting a <br/>\ndivorce, mother is in the hospital as well recovering from a gastro, <br/>\nand my bills are piling up so badly that I can not go see anyone to <br/>\nhelp. I needed to breath. No sooner do I open them do I notice the <br/>\nlittle boy running to his room, and my daughter coming to jump on <br/>\nme. Ok, hug time, I know it will help. Only there is something <br/>\nwrong, my daughter has her hair cut! OMG! One side of her head with <br/>\nher hair cut up to her ear.... I just want to cry. I did not yell, <br/>\nbut I did do something I wish I hadn&#39;t. I asked her what she did to <br/>\nher hair and I know I had anger in my voice. She said she cut it, <br/>\nand I told her that was wrong and she was in trouble and I was going <br/>\nto tell her Daddy. I made a big deal about it even though I tried <br/>\nnot to. I found myself saying far fewer words then I wanted to but <br/>\nstill said too much. She ran to her bathroom to hide! I talked to <br/>\nHubby, and he reminded me it is only hair and it will grow. HE was <br/>\nthe peaceful parent for once. Thats new for him. I came out of my <br/>\nroom to find my daughter had cleaned her whole room by herself! She <br/>\ntold me she wanted me to not cry. In the end Hubby is right, but <br/>\ngoddess I feel like a horrible mother now. I talked to Crystal about <br/>\nit after and told her the truth, that I am upset not so much about <br/>\nher hair but because she did not ask me first so I could help make <br/>\nsure it was done nice. I told her I was upset because I did not see <br/>\nher doing it because I was pre-ocupied with other things. I told her <br/>\nthat if she wants short hair she can tell me and that tomorrow <br/>\nmorning her Daddy is going to take her to get her hair cut and maybe <br/>\nthe hair dresser will let her help cut her hair. She then tells me <br/>\nshe wants to have boy hair... and all I could do was force a smile <br/>\nand say oh. Then it hit me to be silly, so I told her maybe we could <br/>\nmake her blond hair blue! And she with such a streight face said no <br/>\nshe wants green hair. I was laughing so hard then with her! It <br/>\nhelped. <br/>\n<br/>\n But still I am left with a terrible feeling that I am a horrible <br/>\nmother. <br/>\n<br/>\n  My roomate calls and just has to shove the knife further by saying <br/>\nher son did not know to come tell me about it because Crystal does <br/>\nso many bad things that I let her do that he does not know what to <br/>\nthink. WHAT? Does bad things? Goddess she got me upset. But I did <br/>\nnot say anything. I know what she is thinking. I let my daughter <br/>\njump on her bed, make some of her own food, wear what she wants, <br/>\nhelp me cook, chase the cats with a water bottle, stay up most all <br/>\nnight if she wants.... SHE is one to talk. Here is my vent, be <br/>\nwarned! She hits her child with objects even like a big brush, she <br/>\nyells at him all the time, often for just wanting to hug her when <br/>\nshe is stressed. SHE is the one that took him yesterday to the <br/>\nhospital for 6 hours with no food and nothing to do! She is the one <br/>\nthat smokes a pack a day even though she has lung problems and her <br/>\nson is depending on her to be healthy and she just refuses to quit. <br/>\nSHE is the one that lets her son play out side with no adult <br/>\nwatching and no older children right next to a road where anyone <br/>\ncould take him. SHE is the one who forces him to read or she will <br/>\nnot pay attention to him. SHE is the one that takes him to a party <br/>\nwith drinking adults, her one of them and a unlocked gun on top of a <br/>\nfridge not to mention other things. So I am little stressed and <br/>\nupset. She is in the hospital because of her habbits and I am here <br/>\ntaking care of her son and all the bills as she is not working. <br/>\n<br/>\n I want to cry....<br/>\n<br/>\n On a different note. Does anyone have any ideas on what I should do <br/>\nabout my pixie baby wanting different color hair?
