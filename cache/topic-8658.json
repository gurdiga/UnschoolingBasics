We just did not get the whole PS2<br/>\nthing and the sitting, sitting, sitting.  Well, on September 1st my husband<br/>\nand I stopped all our control issues and gave complete choices to our dd (or<br/>\nhas some would call...free reign...not our kingdom anymore) to everything,<br/>\nincluding PS2.  I had wonderful advise from RUs that our dd was going to go<br/>\ncrazy with it, but to be patient and she would regulate herself because it<br/>\nwould not be a control issue anymore.  It took about 2 1/2 months of<br/>\nnon-stop play (we did not say a word, roll eyes, or any of that stuff to<br/>\nsilently impose our view) and then...finally she just stopped and said she<br/>\nwas bored of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then she goes back and forth between many activities, including PS2<br/>\nand Neopets on the computer.  She has a wide variety of interests.  Some of<br/>\nthe best info to me though, was that &quot;what makes a book, or something else,<br/>\nbetter than PS2, Neopets, etc.&quot;  IT DOES NOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other night I watched in amazment as my daughter typed (several years<br/>\nago we forced a typing program on her...obviously she rebeled!) and now<br/>\nshe&#39;s typing wonderfully and fast because she wants to...several<br/>\ndescriptions onto Neopets.  The descriptions had some big, complex words<br/>\nthat she learned to read, spell, and understand from PS2.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I am saying, &quot;don&#39;t try to understand it&quot;....just know that they<br/>\nare gaining something from it for themselves.
