There is really value in EVERYTHING in unschooling. <br/>\n2. It&#39;s time for ME to de-school and examine all that I thought was <br/>\ntrue about learning.<br/>\n3. Initiate activities for me right now. <br/>\n4. Leave her be for a while.<br/>\n5. Connect with her where she NEEDS to be at this time in her life.<br/>\n6. Join her in her world and use all of that time together as <br/>\nstarting points for great conversations. <br/>\n7. Really *listen* to her thoughts about things. <br/>\n8. Let her know that I want to learn about the world from HER eyes <br/>\nand HER perspective. <br/>\n9. Focus on Joy. Really. That&#39;s all I need to do right now. It&#39;s <br/>\nvacation time in my home...bring on the Joy.<br/>\n10. Do things for ME. Be curious. Ask questions and find answers. <br/>\nExplore. Create. Build. Sing. <br/>\n11. Unleash MY buried unschooling desires.<br/>\n12. However many years she was in school, allow that many months (of <br/>\ndeschooling)<br/>\n13.
