Actually, <br/>\nmy education has very little to do with my real life in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14yo didn&#39;t read anything but emails and the stuff you mentioned <br/>\nuntil pretty recently. Well, he&#39;s still not *reading* other <br/>\nmaterial, but he&#39;s writing up a storm. Seven chapters and we haven&#39;t <br/>\neven gotten to the dragon&#39;s lair, yet! George and I are kind of <br/>\nstunned bc, like your son, he *hated* anything to do with books or <br/>\nreading. After more than a year of not being &quot;asked&quot; to read <br/>\nanything at all, his attitude has changed completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6yo has been unschooled from the start and has no qualms about <br/>\nreading whatever interests her. What interests *her* tends to be <br/>\ninstructions. How do I make that? If she wants a story... turn on <br/>\nthe tv, put in a movie. Will she ever read books for fun? &lt;shrug&gt; <br/>\nWho knows? Lately she&#39;s been asking how to make computer games - <br/>\nanyone got a good resource for that??????? Something simple enough <br/>\nfor a parent to use! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How do I learn to let go of those fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It might help to think about what Learning is, as opposed to <br/>\nEducation. How does this miraculous thing we call Learning happen? <br/>\nIt happens by making connections, big and small, lots and lots of <br/>\nconnections. The connections that are made are going to be different <br/>\nfor every person. I&#39;m not just talking about a difference in <br/>\nlearning styles, here. This is even more fundamental. Since no two <br/>\npeople ever have exactly the same experiences, no two people will <br/>\nmake connections in exactly the same way. That&#39;s not something that <br/>\ncan be controlled for. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the connections people make are emotional. Right now your <br/>\nkids have some specific emotional connections with &quot;reading&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;math&quot;. My 14yo used to have some similar connections <br/>\nreading=ugh, for example ;) Now reading and writing are about self-<br/>\nexpression and communication and sharing. He&#39;s made some new <br/>\nconnections and those have changed his experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s how unschooling works. We (parents) strive to make living as <br/>\njoy-filled as possible so that learning is more about positive <br/>\nconnections. I don&#39;t mean &quot;joy filled&quot; so much in terms of having a <br/>\ndaily carnival in the living room (although *my* living room <br/>\ncertainly looks that way!), but generally enjoying life. What does <br/>\nthat look like? You might want to check out some unschoolers blogs <br/>\nto get some ideas... here&#39;s a link that has a bunch of unschoolers&#39; <br/>\nblogs (scroll down):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://organiclearning.org/resources.html\">http://organiclearning.org/resources.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI really need some quick advice on just what <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; unschooling is and how to get going at it<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In general, you can start making a more joyful life by thinking <br/>\nabout the ways you prevent the spread of joy in your family and <br/>\nfinding ways to foster joy instead. I say &quot;you&quot; not to be <br/>\naccusatory, but because you can only change yourself ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nA common place to start is by working on saying Yes more. Every time <br/>\nyou want to say &quot;no&quot; to something, stop and think &quot;why not? is there <br/>\na way to make that possible?&quot; Saying &quot;no&quot; is such a default response <br/>\nto kids that we&#39;re rarely aware of how often we say it. We even say <br/>\nthings like: &quot;not right now&quot; instead of: &quot;yes, I&#39;d love to do that, <br/>\njust let me finish what I&#39;m doing&quot;. Think about the change of <br/>\nattitude you can create just by doing that - its significant!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother good place to start is by practicing more kindness toward <br/>\nyour kids. Again, I&#39;m not trying to make some sort of accusation! <br/>\nBut culturally, there&#39;s a norm of being less kind to our own <br/>\nchildren than we are to adult friends, aquaintances, even complete <br/>\nstrangers. Think of kind things you can do for your kids. Do them <br/>\nfavors &quot;just because&quot; with no thought of reciprocation. Say nice <br/>\nthings to them because it feels good to them, not with ideas <br/>\nof &quot;positive reinforcement&quot;. Give free hugs. Hang out with them when <br/>\nthey are doing something they enjoy even if its something you&#39;re not <br/>\nthrilled about (watching tv, playing a video game). Smile at them <br/>\noften.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay that&#39;s enough for now! Give yourself plenty of time to learn <br/>\nsome new skills and habits - there *is* time. Memories of a loving, <br/>\nkind mom will last longer than the quadratic equation. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: new to group","postDate":"1209315365","msgId":32168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2MmI3NSs5N2MyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ2Mjk3OCs1M2NzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32167,"nextInTopic":32170,"prevInTime":32167,"nextInTime":32169,"topicId":4162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ Ned Vare says, Unschooling is living your life as if there ... time- it meant so much!

No grade levels, no needing to learn anything<br/>\nby a specific time. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a great quote.

They prepare<br/>\nfor college if they&#39;re college bound. It can be done in just a few<br/>\nmonths time if necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the NE Unschooling conference I&#39;ll be hosting a teen talk with<br/>\nthree of my favorite teens.:) My oldest son Trevor, his gf Moira and<br/>\nmy 14y.o. son Jared. Moira is in college and doing very well after<br/>\nbeing unschooled for most of her life and having no formal lessons. It<br/>\nwas her goal, for her reasons and she is utilizing it as ONE tool in a<br/>\nvery rich and iteresting life.<br/>\n<br/>\nCollege is not money well-spent for most people. Humans should prepare<br/>\nfor that things that they have personal reasons  to prepare for. An<br/>\nunschooling parent is better to spend time and energy nourishing what<br/>\n is right in front of them today and let the future unfold when it<br/>\nunfolds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no reason to spend time today  preparing for a future that is<br/>\nunknown. If your child has a reason to prepare for college, help them<br/>\nprepare at that time.

Or whatever. I&#39;ve learned you can&#39;t unschool certain<br/>\nsubjects - you either trust they&#39;re getting what they need, or you<br/>\ndon&#39;t.

I have 4 children ages----9boy, 5girl, 4girl, and 3 month old girl.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have been toying with the idea of unschooling for a few years now.  I just keep getting worried that they won&#39;t learn what they need to.  So I have been using a little of this and a little of that for them.  I don&#39;t like doing school at home and I detest workbooks and textbooks unless they are to show something to the children not use on a daily basis.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I had my oldest tested when he was in the first grade and found him to have a very high IQ.  I also noticed how bored he was when I tried to get him to do anything he didn&#39;t show an interest in.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My 5 year old is a very smart and self motivated learner.  She loves the workbooks and the more the better.  I will probably continue using school items with her because that is what she is responding to, even if I don&#39;t like them.  I love Math U See and we do that daily.  I have my son reading daily to me and I read a lot to them.  We go to the library a lot also.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My 4 year old just turned 4 last week and she is teaching herself to read as did her older sister.  Sometimes its hard to keep up with them.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  If my son had his way he would play video games all day long.  However he does come to me with these unique questions that are hard to answer sometimes.  So he is learning or at least thinking.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am excited to be a part of this group so I can have help from others when I feel the need to buy curriculum.  I am part of a homeschooling group but find it difficult to discuss my style of teaching with anyone.  They think I&#39;m nuts for not having stuff scheduled.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks again for allowing me to join.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Angel <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

In many cases people moving into Unschooling have<br/>\ndiscovered that their child&#39;s ADD is a condition that was caused by being in<br/>\nschool or having school-at-home lessons imposed on them. <br/>\n<br/>\nStep two is to do nothing that is remotely schoolish - &quot;lessons&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;subjects&quot;, &quot;assignments&quot; of any kind. Purge these terms from your<br/>\nvocabulary. Pretend that it is summer vacation early and just have fun -<br/>\nvegetating, preparing for the holidays, watching movies, playing outdoors,<br/>\nplaying computer games. What you will be doing is called &quot;deschooling&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;decompressing&quot; - healing from the emotional damage that being schooled may<br/>\nhave done, and allowing the authentic selves to return.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally please go to www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and<br/>\nwww.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html and do a whole lot of<br/>\nreading there.
