I also love unschooling with my girls (4 & 7).  I love to <br/>\nlearn and often get wrapped up in things and many times they will go <br/>\nfor HOURS when enthralled in something.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I will be at the table in the kitchen working on my new <br/>\nproject, one daughter in the sunroom working a puzzle or laying out a <br/>\nblock city and the other at the coffee table in the living room <br/>\ndrawing costumes or listening to music. I&#39;m near them and can see <br/>\nthem. We break for food and drink, but many times spend our days <br/>\nlearning by ourselves. If it were cooler (pretty nasty in Louisiana in <br/>\nJuly and August) we would break to go outside too.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould there be balance?  Should we disengage ourselves from our <br/>\nseparate interests to do things together - or just keep going as is?  <br/>\nThey don&#39;t seem to mind and haven&#39;t said anything about it when <br/>\nasked.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they need my help, I help.  When they ask me to join, I join.   <br/>\nSometimes I leave new things on a side cabinet to spark a <br/>\nconversation - like a book open to magnetism, with some magnets, other <br/>\nobjects and a piece of paper asking questions.  Sometimes we do this <br/>\ntogether, sometimes we don&#39;t do it at all.  Many times I offer to read <br/>\nstories or do something with them.  Sometimes they accept, sometimes <br/>\ndecline.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to unschooling.  We did &quot;school at home&quot; for 2 years before <br/>\nand it drove us bonkers.  I don&#39;t want to be &quot;neglectful&quot; (as my MIL <br/>\ncalls it), but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to interupt their <br/>\ncreative processes. Should there be a balance?  How does one acheive <br/>\nthat balance? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nCara :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16588,"nextTopicId":16617}}
