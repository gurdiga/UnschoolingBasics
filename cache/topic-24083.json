Maybe work on being interested in<br/>\nthe things she&#39;s interested and stop walking away when she&#39;s talking<br/>\nabout her stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, my kids are each interested in things I could care less<br/>\nabout but when they want to talk about something or show me something<br/>\n&quot;cool,&quot; I pay attention.

But she also doesn&#39;t seem to have much in<br/>\n&gt; common<br/>\n&gt; with the typical (if there is such a thing) unschooled kid. She<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have a love of learning. She isn&#39;t curious and exploring and greedily<br/>\n&gt; sucking up knowledge. She spends her days watching movies over and<br/>\n&gt; over and<br/>\n&gt; over, playing on Furry Paws or Pony Island (online games where you<br/>\n&gt; breed and<br/>\n&gt; care for animals), and occasionally wandering the neighborhood. New<br/>\n&gt; stuff<br/>\n&gt; just doesn&#39;t interest her. Maybe she&#39;s doing great and I just don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; see<br/>\n&gt; it. She&#39;s VERY secure in who she is... almost too much... she has a<br/>\n&gt; set<br/>\n&gt; list of things she likes and anything else isn&#39;t interesting.
