Unschooling is also sometimes called natural ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1962400588\">Unschooling Basics<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is trusting the child to learn what he needs to learn when <br/>\nhe<br/>\nneeds to learn it. Unschooling is also sometimes called &quot;natural <br/>\nlearning&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;child-led learning&quot; . But mostly unschooling is NOT school-at <br/>\nhome: we do<br/>\nnot try to replicate school in our houses. It&#39;s real living in the real<br/>\nworld---for and with a purpose. You cannot live and not learn---we&#39;re<br/>\nsurrounded by real opportunities every day to learn. And it&#39;s REAL <br/>\nlearning,<br/>\nnot simulated as in school. Living is learning is unschooling is living <br/>\nis learning is<br/>\nunschooling.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>\non<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>\nin the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>\npopular<br/>\nbooks are How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Teach Your Own, and <br/>\nLearning<br/>\nAll the Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>\nfinally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>\nunschooling. His two big books are Dumbing Us Down and The Underground<br/>\nHistory of American Education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>\nschool. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s Punished by Rewards shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (learning because it&#39;s FUN!).<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>\nand<br/>\nGet a REAL Education) is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great read <br/>\nfor<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>\nlittle<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>\nand share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, The Homeschooling Handbook and The <br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\nHandbook. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>\ndocumenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in several <br/>\nstates, it&#39;s very<br/>\nhelpful. But The Unschooling Handbook is THE handbook for new <br/>\nunschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>\nConvinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: And the Skylark Sings with Me and Homeschooling <br/>\nand the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a brand new book that I highly recommend: The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>\ndaughter, Laurie. I give it as gifts a LOT!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>\n“Live Free Learn Free”<br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt.

There are other wonderful posters, but <br/>\nthese are all radical unschoolers who all have great ways of expressing <br/>\nthemselves and getting to the nitty gritty of unschooling. They will <br/>\nall be at the conference in October.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a radical unschooler of three children, 18, 15, & 13. <br/>\nShe has her own website that is chocked FULL of essays and stories about<br/>\nunschooling.

Its mission is to <br/>\nsupport and promote unschooling, provide information, offer <br/>\nopportunities for families to get together, and empower families to <br/>\nmake the choices that respect the rights, needs and aspirations of <br/>\ntheir children. L&L welcomes anyone with an interest in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince its inception in 2001, L&L has supported families that have made <br/>\nthe decision to unschool as they face difficult questions and <br/>\nchallenges. These families may wonder about socialization, or <br/>\nintegration of John Holt&#39;s educational philosophy into their everyday <br/>\nlives. Some families may doubt their abilities, feel confused and ask <br/>\nthemselves, &quot;Can I really do this?&quot;. L&L encourages parents to trust <br/>\nthemselves and their children to make good decisions and empowers them <br/>\nto find the support and information they need. L&L also gives you the <br/>\nopportunity to see unschooling families “up close and personal”---to <br/>\nsee them in action!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information, contact Kelly Lovejoy @ (803) 776 4849 or visit <br/>\nour<br/>\nwebsite-<br/>\nwww.LiveandLearnConference.org<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYou may also all me anytime to ask questions or discuss concerns.
