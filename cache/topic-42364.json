At first, we had school at home for about 3 mos, then stopped because our relationships were deteriorating.

I&#39;m specifically thinking of the build-your-own paper stages with the paper-doll characters because Mo likes those, but I&#39;m sure there are others types. See if your kids would like to set up a puppet theater and do their own Nutcracker - or do something more simply with the toys they have. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks for the idea.

I just showed him Scratch, but he really wasn&#39;t interested in it. I was thinking about showing him Flash, which I know he may not care for right now, either, but at least he&#39;ll know it&#39;s there. Right now, he enjoys signing up for emails from websites (food network, hgtv, directv, etc) and reading and forwarding them to us. We also email back and forth with him. And that&#39;s fine and he&#39;s grasping how the internet works and how email works and the options with his email account...and I have to accept that I can&#39;t always help in the way that I know how to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure it&#39;s enough for him and when he needs more, he&#39;ll ask or find it himself. But the difference is that I can find things for my dd that I know she cares about or is interested in, but it&#39;s harder for me with ds. He doesn&#39;t fall into the typical &quot;user&quot; category, or the &quot;programmer&quot;. And I&#39;m not disappointed or wishing he would do more, I just wish I could offer up something interesting for him on this particular adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has legos, do y&#39;all have any motors for them?

Many kids can do both, you know. Ask if they&#39;d like to try it. Also look into audio books, movies, shows. Kids can develop an interest in anywhere in the world just from watching a show set there, or with a character (or actor) from that place.

I quit stressing over the idea that my<br/>\nkids were doing nothing but playing. I quit trying to force the issue of<br/>\ngoing to museums or other places that had &quot;educational&quot; value. Instead, I<br/>\ntried to find more opportunities for them to play at home, at the park, and<br/>\nanywhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest is 8 and she loves the computer games. She plays Yoville from one<br/>\nof my accounts and she will do that all day long. How do I know that she is<br/>\nprogressing? I watch her and I get invovled in her games. If your son likes<br/>\ne-mail, maybe he can get on some of the discussion boards or find some pen<br/>\npals that he can e-mail on a regular basis. For that matter, you can start<br/>\ncommunicating with him via e-mail on occasion. If you communicate with him<br/>\nvia e-mail on occasion, that will be something measurable that you can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger kids seem to prefer playing to anything else. We pick up stuff at<br/>\ngarage sales and thrift stores.  I think my house is a giant toybox because<br/>\nof all the things that we have picked up here and there for them to<br/>\nincorporate into their play. We are always trying to find interesting things<br/>\nto leave around the house. We have a ton of books but I also try to find<br/>\nthings that they can look at, touch, feel, or otherwise manipulate.  If you<br/>\nlook around at some of the unschooling sites, you will see it referred to as<br/>\nstrewing. I have been doing that for a long time and never realized that it<br/>\nhad a name.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of looking for learning opportunities, I look for opportunities for<br/>\nmy kids to play. There is a local homeschool group that meets at the park<br/>\nonce a week that has playing and connecting as its sole purpose. They end up<br/>\nlearning a lot from other kids in unstructured environments like the park.<br/>\nGoing to the park is a great way to get out of the house and still play. A<br/>\nlot of people don&#39;t realize just how much a kid is learning when they are<br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":147076970,"authorName":"Stacy Barnes","from":"&quot;Stacy Barnes&quot; &lt;barnes@...&gt;","profile":"stacyd1029","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Questions about the &quot;day to day&quot; - long- sorry","postDate":"1260198568","msgId":42364,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmajVyOCtxaWNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42367,"prevInTime":42363,"nextInTime":42365,"topicId":42364,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m new here and have found this list to be a wealth of info and insight.

I have been reading every book on unschooling I can find, but I still have questions. I can really relate to those who want to see something &quot;measurable&quot; in terms of learning and it&#39;s sometimes difficult to relax and live in the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe arrived in the unschooling world after ps and trying school at home. School at home didn&#39;t work well for very long and I take the responsibility for that. The order and structure greatly appealed to me, but we were not enjoying each other at all after a few months.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll along, I&#39;ve read about and been drawn to unschooling. I know everyone&#39;s lives and children are different, but the one thing I read that sticks out if how the author&#39;s child/ren find their interest, their thing, usually early on in their lives, and how the parents supports it and furthers it and it continues to grow and everyone is satisfied and sees the development, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not really experiencing that with my children and I wonder, often, what I&#39;m doing wrong. My children, 7 dd, and 9 ds, haven&#39;t not really found their &quot;thing&quot; yet. My son has an interest in technology that we support, but my efforts to introduce software, etc, are usually appreciated, but not used. He&#39;s fascinated with email, how it works, internet connections (getting the web on the wii), stuff like that, so I&#39;ve organized a field trip to our local computer place that also provides internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is interested in ballet, so we&#39;re going to the Nutcracker this weekend and we borrowed some library books about ballet. We&#39;re also going (weather permitting) skating on Wed. and will probably try ballet lessons after the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, having said all of that, my children just enjoy playing together and while it&#39;s pretty great how well they play and get along (mostly) I can&#39;t help but wonder if it&#39;s enough, whatever that means.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir play is mostly re-enactments of something we&#39;ve done, like flying to NC. They then play &quot;airport&quot; for the next three days, after they&#39;ve turned the LR into airports with security, etc. We took our 7 yo to urgent care, and they played that for 2 days, with their stuffed animals, writing prescriptions, weighing everyone with our BR scales, taking temps and administering shots. Sometimes they just set up a ball game with their animals, tinkertoys for the boundaries, fun foam for uniforms, and a scoreboard. They also have their own &quot;lego city&quot; in a spare room downstairs. They have a population sign and all of the businesses you may find in a city. They sometimes get the Game of Life board game out and we all play, but it&#39;s nothing like it. They have their own game we play with it instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also live in the country and our playdates with others are not that frequent, especially with the winter coming on. They like going to new places, and sometimes they go to a friend&#39;s house, but mostly they prefer each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe tried &quot;Five in a Row&quot; stories because I thought that might be a good way to introduce them to new places, things, etc, and they really liked it at first, but now, they seem to prefer playing to hearing a book read to them. Maybe my timing needs work on that, but they really only want to play, so maybe I should try it at bedtime?<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that all of this is good, and it truly does help to process info by using it yourself. I know they are processing their experiences by doing these things and every family&#39;s journey looks different. Is there more I should be doing for them? I get books at the library about different topics that I think they might like, but they usually aren&#39;t that interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildhood is going by so quickly and I don&#39;t want to fail them, but after the school-at-home experience, I&#39;m just happy to have a better, more positive relationship with them. And no, my extended family is not that supportive of unschooling, so while I&#39;m firm with my beliefs when I talk with them, I can&#39;t always ignore the small seed of doubt they try to plant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, any feedback would be helpful from those who know more and have experienced more than I. Thank you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nStacy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42373,"nextTopicId":42335}}
