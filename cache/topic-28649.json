It&#39;s sometimes harder as  <br/>\nJulian gets older to think of something, but I was SOO happy with what I made  <br/>\nfor him, and he loved it, so I wanted to share.<br/>\n <br/>\nSalad Fingers is a weird online video series. He&#39;s creepy and has an  <br/>\ninteresting little voice that Julian can copy extremely well. You can see him  here: <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fat-pie.com/salad.htm_\">http://www.fat-pie.com/salad.htm_</a> (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fat-pie.com/salad.htm)\">http://www.fat-pie.com/salad.htm)</a> <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I made Julian a Salad Fingers doll on the knitting looms. The  <br/>\npicture is on my knitting loom lens here:  _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/_\">http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/)\">http://www.squidoo.com/loomknit/)</a>    It&#39;s with the other pictures near the bottom.<br/>\n <br/>\nJulian made me a great duct tape crochet hook holder and Beth a duct tape  <br/>\nwallet. I made Beth a melted bead bowl. Beth knitted me a gorgeous bamboo yarn  <br/>\nshawl, and made Julian a collage about the marriage equality fight that he  <br/>\nworked so hard for.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was a really nice Christmas eve.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling conference Memorial Day Weekend, May 23-25 <br/>\n2008 in  Peabody, Massachusetts _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************See AOL&#39;s top rated recipes <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://food.aol.com/top-rated-recipes?NCID=aoltop00030000000004)\">http://food.aol.com/top-rated-recipes?NCID=aoltop00030000000004)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28644,"nextTopicId":28657}}
