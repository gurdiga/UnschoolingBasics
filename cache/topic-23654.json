Now, after 6 yrs it&#39;s not so good, and that was likely a gradual, insidious shift from good to bad.

I can see the temptation to find some private time. We let my mil talk us into signing Andy up for kindergarten a year ahead of our own schedule, to &#39;give Dan, the baby, more time (thankfully we came to our senses and never sent Andy to kg, it would have been hell for him).  But what does that say to the child who is &#39;deferred,&#39; and what does it say to the child who is supposed to benefit from the extra time and energy?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Could you just declare summer vacation right now, and make the leap into unschooling as a household now, and let what happens in August unfold in its own time?  It may be that your daughter chooses to continue school, and your youngest may choose to go or to stay home, but it would be nice if being home with Nathaniel was left as an open choice.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nGive spam the boot.

He had all kinds <br/>\nof &quot;labels&quot;, including Asperger&#39;s, OCD, behaviorally disabled, <br/>\nanxiety, and the school system was failing him too.  He was bullied <br/>\nand teased, and hated school so much he became severely depressed <br/>\nand suicidal.  The instant I pulled him out of school (middle of his <br/>\n5th grade year), his anxiety disappeared, and I no longer see any of <br/>\nthe labels he was given.  I only see a child that sometimes sees the <br/>\nworld a bit differently, and we are learning together on how to help <br/>\nhim deal with certain situations that are difficult for him.  I used <br/>\nto think the school&#39;s behavioral specialist really knew what she was <br/>\ntalking about, and was taking DS from doctor to doctor to find out <br/>\nwhat was &quot;wrong&quot; with him, but now I know that SCHOOL was what was <br/>\nwrong with him!  He is now happier than I&#39;ve ever seen him.  He gets <br/>\nplenty of time with other kids thru un/homeschool support groups, <br/>\nand these kids are much kinder than kids in PS, and he rarely has <br/>\nany issues with them.  If he does, the kids are always able to work <br/>\nit out themselves.  SOOO different from the kids in PS.  There is <br/>\ncertainly never any bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy pulling Nate out of school to unschool, you will hopefully stop <br/>\nseeing him as someone with so many labels (children hear themselves <br/>\nbeing called all these things, and it makes them think something is <br/>\nwrong with them - this can be very damaging), but instead start <br/>\nseeing him as a perfect being that just needs some guidance and help <br/>\nin some areas of his life.  You will eventually fall into a groove <br/>\nof finding what his interests are and pursuing those interests, and <br/>\nwith that comes learning naturally (usually for both parent AND <br/>\nchild).  If his experience in school was anything like my son&#39;s, he <br/>\nwill no doubt need LOTS of time to decompress, to DEschool, to just <br/>\nplay and have fun.  Don&#39;t stress about whether he will learn <br/>\nanything, he will, simply thru living life.  But more importantly, <br/>\nhe will be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith joy,<br/>\nJody Z.<br/>\nMomma to Riley (12)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jnaisi&quot; <br/>\n&lt;robyn.bentley@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I want to unschool my son Nathaniel.

He has had a horrendous time at many<br/>\ndifferent schools. He currently lives with his dad and<br/>\nattends public school - however, he is actually<br/>\nenjoying school - this school has a large population<br/>\nof Aspie boys and treats them with the dignity and<br/>\nrespect all children deserve. In fact, he has told me<br/>\nthat he misses living with me and would like to move<br/>\nback but he likes his school too much to leave it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7yr old has ADHD, huge anxiety issues, and may have<br/>\nAsperger&#39;s as well (I have decided at this time not to<br/>\npursue a &#39;proper&#39; diagnoses by an &#39;expert&#39;). He<br/>\nattended a public Montessori for kindergarten - that<br/>\nwent really poorly and he left with all sorts of<br/>\nnegative behavior issues he did not start with. Then<br/>\nhe attended a year of Waldorf kindergarten which was<br/>\nvery healing and relaxing for him (and vital for our<br/>\nfamily as we were not yet ready to consided<br/>\nhomeschooling). Then this year began 1st grade and it<br/>\nwent south really, really fast and he came home in<br/>\nearly October.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been almost exclusively unschooling since then<br/>\nand my son is blossoming. He is learning again how to<br/>\ntrust the world around him. We watch a lot of reality<br/>\nshows (such like Risk Takers that are mini<br/>\ndocumentaries on professions such as cop, border<br/>\npatrol, etc., he loves Mythbusters, Star Trek and Star<br/>\nWars, he really enjoys shows about &#39;real&#39; stuff and<br/>\n&#39;real&#39; people and their lives). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our state we have to do either a standardized test<br/>\nor personnel assessment each year - since their is not<br/>\nway he would be able to sit still for a long test we<br/>\nwent with the assessment - and he spent a lot of that<br/>\ntime curled up against me in a lovely, reassuring<br/>\ncuddle. The beauty for my family in this assessment is<br/>\nthat the way it was done we were given grade level<br/>\nequal. at the end of it and my 7yr old with no formal<br/>\neducation since kindergarten scored between 3rd and<br/>\n8th grade depending on the subject. I was just amazed<br/>\nat the technical and historical information he has<br/>\nlearned from his reading and watching. This is such a<br/>\nblessing of reassurance - especially for my husband<br/>\nwho works for our local school system and has been a<br/>\nbit worried about my ways of &#39;doing school&#39; with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son gets really anxious if he has to do too many<br/>\nout of the house stuff in a day - so we can schedule<br/>\njust one or two. He doesn&#39;t like to be away from me<br/>\nfor long and we can work with that as well. I am<br/>\ndeeply grateful for this opportunity to honor my<br/>\nbeautiful boy were he is instead of having to try and<br/>\nforce him to fit into someone else&#39;s mold.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know your son best, and will learn so much more<br/>\nabout him with him home with you. The more you can<br/>\ncontrol to triggers for his anxiety the more he can<br/>\nexist without that constant state of fear and begin<br/>\nhealing and growing more naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~I want to unschool my son Nathaniel. I have many <br/>\nreasons but<br/>\nprimarily it is because the school he attends now<br/>\nfailed him. He is<br/>\nalso Autistic, Bipolar, ADD/ADHD and has issues with<br/>\nanxiety. The<br/>\nschool is offering him no services despite my<br/>\nrequests. I am<br/>\nattempting to get him services again per the request<br/>\nof his behavioral<br/>\nspecialist. He feels Nate would benefit tremendously<br/>\nin a school<br/>\nsetting socially with the help of a one to one aid..<br/>\nCurrently he is a<br/>\nsocial recluse and the victim of hazing and bullying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI most likely will still choose to do the unschooling<br/>\nbecause of the<br/>\ndifficulty and basic overall attitude I am getting<br/>\nfrom the school. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I want my child to be in a school where<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto help him be successful. My son&#39;s average is a U (F)<br/>\nthis entire<br/>\nschool year. They do not seem to care.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe Nate will be exremely successful with video<br/>\nlearning. He<br/>\nretains atleast 95% of what he sees in movies. Does<br/>\nanyone know where<br/>\nI can find lessons that are set to a movie or video<br/>\ntype setting? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What we do for ourselves dies with us.

IN fact he did not enjoy reading <br/>\nfiction in the slightest, because it was full of ambiguity, didn&#39;t make sense and the <br/>\ncharacters themselves didn&#39;t make sense. So he didn&#39;t. He did read a lot of nonfiction and <br/>\nhe obtained a lot of what he needed/wanted from that. <br/>\nAs he got older, he gradually started picking up fiction, mostly stories that seemed to be <br/>\non topic with his favorite nonfiction books. I helped a lot by looking for short fiction books <br/>\nthat contained topics he liked. Next thing I knew he was reading harry potter and laughing <br/>\noutloud. He did have a lot of questions for me at first, and pretty much every book he read <br/>\nfrom age nine on, I read along with him so that at dinner, or riding in the car, or playing <br/>\nvideo games, i could say &quot;Wow, what do you think Snape was thinking on page 167?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone reads fiction for fun. i personally don&#39;t like reading nonfiction, although if <br/>\nit&#39;s on one of my own special interests I will.

We&#39;ve been told that there is this focal point that is in the middle of &#39;well-<br/>\nrounded individual&#39; and so we push things that the kiddo&#39;s aren&#39;t interested in.
