The most<br/>\nimportant thing to remember is what Christmas is all<br/>\nabout. We celebrate Christmas to remember God&#39;s gift<br/>\nof his son to us. So, instead of running around<br/>\nspending money on &quot;things&quot; we do other things to keep<br/>\nthe spirit of Christmas. We have done a number of<br/>\nthings over the years but with the kids we have taken<br/>\nto adopting an entire family. Not from one of those<br/>\npublic wish trees but from a priest or social worker<br/>\nor someone that can help us with our questions (sizes,<br/>\ntoy desires, food allergies). Christmas is a time for<br/>\nwants not needs so we try to get fun things as well as<br/>\nneeded items and lots of food, some fun and some<br/>\nnecessary for the kids and adults. My kids go through<br/>\nthe ads looking for the best sales for what they want<br/>\nto buy and spend hours going through coupons and<br/>\nmatching them with grocery circulars. We buy big<br/>\nquantities in Costco too. It will do your heart good,<br/>\ntrust me.<br/>\nFor family we do simple things, generally consumable.<br/>\nLearn how to make candy, paint chocolate, roll candles<br/>\nwith beeswax, make stationary, I&#39;m sure you can think<br/>\nof lots of crafts the kids would like to try. The only<br/>\nexception I make is for my 85 year old mother, I use<br/>\nChristmas as an excuse to buy her something she<br/>\ndesperately needs but can&#39;t afford, usually a house<br/>\nrepair type item. Let your family know that you chose<br/>\nto put your resources to help a needy family. It would<br/>\nbe un-Christian for them to complain, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\nBetter yet, invite them to do it too!! To round out<br/>\nChristmas make sure you write in stone some fun<br/>\noutings. I found that once they were on the calendar<br/>\nwe were more likely to go than just saying we wanted<br/>\nto go. Pick a night to drive around town and see<br/>\nlights and a Christmas concert and whatever special<br/>\nevent is in your proximity. And don&#39;t forget the<br/>\nNutcracker! Make fun traditions instead of money ones.<br/>\nMy dh is Santa at the Y&#39;s breakfast every year, then<br/>\nwe go cut down our Christmas tree.  Oddly, my dh is<br/>\nalso the one who sets up the haunted house for<br/>\nHalloween! My kids know they will get what they need<br/>\nand want and they honestly love what we do. Just jump<br/>\noff the bandwagon- you&#39;ll be glad you did!!<br/>\nELISA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We have a collective responsibility to the least of us-Phil Ramone<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can do no great things; only small things with great love- Mother Teresa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBuilding a website is a piece of cake.
