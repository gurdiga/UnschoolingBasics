I read the blog by the person who<br/>\nwas there during the taping.  I know, I know, I should have waited to<br/>\ndraw my own conclusions first.  Having said that, I do feel healthy<br/>\ndiscussion is good and that there is something positive about the<br/>\ndiscussion even being had. I think the part that bothered me the most<br/>\nwas about the audience filling.  It makes it challenging to have a<br/>\nbalanced discussion when the moderators rig the balance of the audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also heard/read that based on the initial response to the<br/>\noriginal format of the show, that the producers somehow toned it down<br/>\nbefore it actually aired.  I don&#39;t know that to be true or not, but<br/>\nthe original airing was to have been October 27th and it was delayed<br/>\nfor whatever reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my opinion is based on my own thoughts of Dr Phil himself. <br/>\nHaving a background in psychology and being a hypnotherapist myself, I<br/>\nrelate to him in perhaps a different way. I see that he often puts his<br/>\nguests in a very defensive position and that is not helpful to anyone<br/>\nin finding resolution to an issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo having said that, I do see that some good will come out of his<br/>\nprogram in that the discussion is at least being had and that it has<br/>\ncome to the attention of many that homeschooling is becoming more and<br/>\nmore prevalent.  If I weren&#39;t already homeschooling, my question would<br/>\nbe WHY?  Why are so many choosing to homeschool now?  Could it be that<br/>\nperhaps the system, such as it is now, no longer serves it&#39;s purpose<br/>\nfor the benefit and betterment of all?  I wouldn&#39;t pit homeschool vs<br/>\npublic school, I&#39;d find out why so many educated and rational people<br/>\nare choosing to go this route.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle L.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255297978,"authorName":"Dawn Bennink","from":"&quot;Dawn Bennink&quot; &lt;bennink4@...&gt;","profile":"mhbmommy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] DR.PHIL.....GREAT Homeschooling DEBATE AIRS today","postDate":"1164472303","msgId":19282,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMTkwMWM3MTBhZiQzNGQyZjQzMCRkOTgyNWYxOEBCTFNDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVrNzRlbStxYzZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19281,"nextInTopic":19289,"prevInTime":19281,"nextInTime":19283,"topicId":19234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Apparently the polls on their shows close at the end of the day a show airs.
