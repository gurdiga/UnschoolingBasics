It may be a  <br/>\nprofessional writer, but doesnt have to be, we can help. If you are  <br/>\ninterested yourself or if you know anybody, please write us: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:johanna.gundermann@...\">johanna.gundermann@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;unerzogen&quot; is a young German magazine, it&#39;s only been out there  <br/>\nalmost 2 years now. It issues 4 times a year. We publish articles on  <br/>\nunschooling, respectful parenting (equal rights for all ages),  <br/>\ndemocratic education (as our only option for free learning since  <br/>\nhomeschooling is illegal in Germany) and about the right to choose  <br/>\nyour own education (which we do not have in Germany). Since our first  <br/>\nissue, we have published two articles about unschooling in each issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forward this message to other mailinglists if you can, as well  <br/>\nas friends or groups where there might be people who are interested.  <br/>\nI&#39;m writing only to this mailinglist, in hope you will forward to the  <br/>\nmany other unschooling mailingslist that exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn of the things the article should be about is, that from an  <br/>\nunschooling point of view, it doesn&#39;t matter if the child ist 10 or 4  <br/>\nyears old. Children learn all the time. Then it could have ideas and  <br/>\ntips on what to do with kids that age, how does it look like when  <br/>\nparents who embrace unschooling have kids that are so young that  <br/>\n&quot;school&quot; isn&#39;t an option anyway. Do they still act differently, do  <br/>\nthey see their kid&#39;s &quot;learning&quot; in a different way, does anything  <br/>\nchange when they turn 6....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for reading,<br/>\n<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41936,"nextTopicId":41884}}
