Also, time - how long is it, can I watch the whole <br/>\nthing and still play with my friends or do I have to stop it? I know <br/>\nmy DS (almost 8) has gotten good at finding the runtime of videos <br/>\nand checking the clock to see if he has enough time before x to <br/>\nwatch the whole thing. Then there&#39;s literature: the good vs evil <br/>\ngenre; the &#39;tragic flaw&#39; - Anakin&#39;s fear and anger and regret <br/>\nregarding his mother plays into his fears for Padme which eventually <br/>\ndrive him to the Dark Side - it&#39;s classic (you can probably even <br/>\nfind similar themes in Shakespeare!); plot devices; all that kind of <br/>\nstuff is the makings of literature. History - even though it isn&#39;t <br/>\nspecifically *our* history, it&#39;s not a far stretch from watching how <br/>\nPalpatine used fear of the Separatists to consolidate power and <br/>\nbring the Empire to war and how Hitler used fear in the aftermath of <br/>\nWWI to come to power and plunge Europe and the world into war <br/>\n(obviously very over simplified); there&#39;s also the concepts of <br/>\ndemocracy, republic, empire forms of government involved. Science: <br/>\ncloning is a big obvious one - is it possible to do what they did to <br/>\nmake the clone army?; Mustafar - the volcanic planet - is it <br/>\npossible or would such a heavily volcanic planet break apart or cool <br/>\ndown?; why does the space ship break up/burn up on re-entry when <br/>\nthey rescue Palpatine? what&#39;s a laser? the whole realm of robotics <br/>\nis up for grabs here too. Art/music are important - the music cues <br/>\nand feeds off the action - odds are your son can tell just by <br/>\nlistening, which part it is, which characters are involved, and so <br/>\non. The artistic and creative imaginings to make the planetscapes <br/>\nand creatures/aliens and all - not to mention how they tie in to the <br/>\nmodel making, CG, make up/costume fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, there&#39;s probably a lot you could whip together if you <br/>\nneeded that sort of thing. The bigger issue, though, seems to be the <br/>\nidea of separating &quot;educational&quot; from everything else in life.It can <br/>\nbe hard for the person who isn&#39;t home to see how things flow <br/>\ntogether. Even though I could put together a list of stuff, I might <br/>\nchoose to instead ask more questions, find out what is behind the <br/>\nquestions being asked - what are the concerns involved? Then, format <br/>\nthe answer using his own frames of reference - what does he love? <br/>\ndoes he learn from exploring it?

Movies (and TV in general) have been great jumping off points for him when it comes to new interests. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow...these might not all be things that are happening RIGHT when Tristan is watching a movie, but the movies often inspire so many things after.<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan often tries to really analyze the characters....Why did Anakin turn so quickly to the Dark Side?  What other options did he have?  Why did so-and-so choose to do what they did? These conversations usually occur DURING the movie, when I&#39;m enjoying the movie with him.  This can easily carry over to any movie/TV show. (ethics, decision making, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe often uses the Star Wars Galaxy and Middle Earth as backdrops for games, written/oral stories, and drawings he creates.  Often when he makes games they are stylized after D&D or other role playing game, where players have hit points that they gain/lose.  Tristan doesn&#39;t like writing math down so he tallies all the numbers in his head (and somehow is able to remember not only his own but all the other players hit points at the same time).  He seeks out the many books written about Star Wars, and other movies he enjoys.  In addition to fueling his love of reading, he now knows more about Star Wars than both of his geeky, Star Wars loving parents. ;o)  (reading, art, writing, math) <br/>\n<br/>\nTristan also is really getting into the making of movies...he&#39;ll watch the behind the scenes features over and over and often chooses to watch the movies with the director/actor commentaries.  He has watched &quot;The Two Towers&quot; with all three commentaries (actors, director, art/set design).  He learns about the areas where the movies were filmed, different special effects, how the shots were created, the obstacles that had to be overcome in making the films, etc.  This has lead him to create his own movies and then insists on making his own &quot;behind the scenes&quot; feature where he sits in front of the camera to tell the audience his reasoning for making the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Star Wars movies, particularly Episodes I-III are basically one special effect after another.  Tristan has learned SO much about CG effects and will often compare one movie&#39;s effects to another and searches out movies done by the same special effects guys (like Stan Winston, etc.).  This has lead him to looking into how to make latex masks and other &quot;simple&quot; special effects. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if all my ramblings are helpful, Christy, but maybe they&#39;ll give you a few ideas. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Christy Putnam <br/>\n<br/>\n  How is watching 6 hrs of Star Wars educational?<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"marji &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Star Wars Marathon & Learning?","postDate":"1141755281","msgId":10505,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcuMC4xLjAuMC4yMDA2MDMwNzEzMTI0OS4wMWI2OWE1OEBnYWlhd29sZi5vcmc+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwZDMwMWM2NDIwZCQ0MzhiYTBiMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwZDMwMWM2NDIwZCQ0MzhiYTBiMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":10504,"nextInTopic":10509,"prevInTime":10504,"nextInTime":10506,"topicId":10504,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
