What societal belief <br/>\nis he buying into?<br/>\nI&#39;ve been working with the healing aspects of fairy tales for a long time <br/>\nalready. When I mean fairy tales I mainly refer to the German Grimm&#39;s fairy <br/>\ntales collection where most tales have the missing mother or the hateful <br/>\nstep mother aspect.

My father <br/>\ntold me a short while ago that when I was a little baby one day when he came <br/>\nhome from work my mother had packed up her stuff and told him that she was <br/>\ngoing back to her parents because she now had a baby that she could not have <br/>\nwithout a marriage. (we are talking early 50&#39;s) He reasoned with her to <br/>\nstay. She did the same thing again when my next brother was born. Again he <br/>\nreasoned with her to stay. And now they have been together for more than 56 <br/>\nyears. But what has it done to my own perception of who I am and how <br/>\naccepted I am? I mean, I was there when that happened, even though I was <br/>\nsmall.<br/>\nI am not saying that you did something similar with your husband. But <br/>\nsomehow this little one got the idea that &#39;mother&#39; might not be available <br/>\nall the time or that he can&#39;t trust that you will be at his beck and call. <br/>\nThis can be a deep wound and needs soothing and healing. Be grateful that it <br/>\nshows now and not as an undesired addiction when he is grown.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you need to design stories and day to day experiences that build his <br/>\ntrust in being acceptable and loved and adored 100%. Or let him tell the <br/>\nstories he wants to listen to.
