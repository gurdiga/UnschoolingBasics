Un-schooling the only child - Inspiration and experience neede<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hmmm, well, I believe I&#39;ve posted a similar question about 2 years <br/>\n  ago on a similar forum!! LOL!! I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m &quot;Experienced&quot; now, <br/>\n  but I have gained a lot of insight from reading here on this board, <br/>\n  (I don&#39;t post much), and from subscribing to &quot;Life Learning&quot; <br/>\n  magazine, and by just spending time with my DS, who is going to be 11 <br/>\n  in July. <br/>\n<br/>\n  The past 4 months, my 33-year-old brother, (who, by the way was a <br/>\n  self-educated genius!!!), was missing. He disappeared on a trip from <br/>\n  his home in Utah, to come and visit me in So. California. The end <br/>\n  result was a tragedy, as he was found in the desert on March 6th, <br/>\n  murdered, only 55 feet from where the police towed his car from n <br/>\n  December, (a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, I <br/>\n  guess)...but that&#39;s another story!! <br/>\n<br/>\n  During that time, I was extremely pre-occupied with the task of <br/>\n  trying to locate my brother, basically ignoring the &quot;Unschooling&quot;, <br/>\n  because after all, it&#39;s &quot;Unschooling&quot; so why be consumed with trying <br/>\n  to find things for our son to do when something so important requires <br/>\n  my time? (Sounds a little selfish?, But Wait....)<br/>\n<br/>\n  You know what? A new young man has blossomed from this experience! He <br/>\n  discovered new things, on his own, that he never was interested in <br/>\n  before. He found his own things to do/learn...He started building a <br/>\n  block and mortar miniature house, he built a turret out of a washing-<br/>\n  machine box, complete with a rotating scope, he learned how golf <br/>\n  balls were made by watching the Discovery Channel and taking one <br/>\n  apart on his own, he&#39;s able to name MANY airplanes from WWI up <br/>\n  through today because of watching the military channel, and a show <br/>\n  that covers weapons of the future, (can&#39;t think of the name of it <br/>\n  right now), and all because I just left him alone to do as he <br/>\n  pleased. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that&#39;s the problem for a lot of people, myself included. We <br/>\n  are soooo used to being &quot;Schooled&quot; that it&#39;s hard to just let go and <br/>\n  let them learn. We always feel like we need to be &quot;helping&quot; them when <br/>\n  they are quite capable of doing all of this on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n  As for companionship, we&#39;ve offered many times for our son to &quot;be <br/>\n  involved&quot; in group sports, or to take lessons, or take an outside <br/>\n  class of some sort, but he usually just wants to be with us!! I LOVE <br/>\n  that!! He has friends from his days in a Private School, but has <br/>\n  become acquainted with many new friends from sports, church, or <br/>\n  parties or what-have-you. He calls them when he wants a companion, I <br/>\n  don&#39;t orchestrate any of it! And it works! Plus, it builds up his <br/>\n  confidence in using the telephone, and he&#39;s learning the specifics of <br/>\n  planning, date, time, how the friend arrives, how they get home, <br/>\n  dinner or not, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n  We do have exciting things planned as a family, such as going to the <br/>\n  Star Wars Exhibit at the California Museum of Science, visiting the <br/>\n  Living Desert, going camping at the beach...but it&#39;s not always <br/>\n  necessary to &quot;Plan and Schedule&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope what I&#39;m saying is making sense. Thanks for letting me share.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Best of Luck with your Unschooling Journey!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Holz<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23084,"nextTopicId":23091}}
