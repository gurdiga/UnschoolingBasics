They have a new baby at home after being in NICU for 2 months, I had never met his new wife.<br/>\n <br/>\nI was just chatting with his wife and their roommate. She said she knew I homeschooled and asked me why I decided to do that. I went into a really brief explanation and chatted some about how we &quot;unschooled&quot;, but I didn&#39;t use that word.<br/>\n <br/>\nI came back in from going to look at the rest of their house with my husband and his friend and his wife and roommate both looked and smiled at me. I said,&quot;What are you two talking about?&quot; And the roommate said, &quot;We were just talking about how awesome you are, I really like your ideas about education and parenting.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nIt lead into this great discussion about how it wasn&#39;t &quot;my idea&quot;, but but what some of the concepts and ideas behind it are. They were so syked and curious. And they thought it was the greatest thing they had ever heard of. The wife asked me how to get started and I offered to send her some books and e-mail her. She never thought she would breastfeed or AP parent, but she said it just came out of her when the baby was born. She finished college and has been career centered since then, she didn&#39;t even know if she wanted kids. Now in her later 30&#39;s with her first baby at home, she said she felt like she had been wearing rose colored glasses. Not to imply that she has regretted her choices so far, but she has much different thoughts about this new time in her life.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was such a mental massage. I was sharing about unschooling from birth on and they couldn&#39;t be more pumped about the ideas. The wife gave me a hug on the way out and said, &quot;Your such a great Mom and person, keep it up! I can&#39;t wait to e-mail more about it.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, we only visited them for about 5 hours, but it was so nice to be asked about it and have someone not only be positive, but curious in a non-suspicious way.<br/>\n <br/>\nMuch Love,<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBoo! Scare away worms, viruses and so much more!
