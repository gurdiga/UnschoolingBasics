I basically told the kids they could stay up as long as they wanted and mistakenly envisioned kids marching off to bed all on their own within a few weeks. That didn&#39;t happen. My 6 yo was staying up until 1:00 most nights.

I give my younger two plenty of time to wrap up whatever they are doing at the time and tell them we&#39;ll start getting ready for bed within the next half hour or so. Then, after brushing teeth, pjs, etc. we all get into my bed and usually read. My son almost always falls asleep while I read. My daughter takes longer to get settled so I&#39;ll read or go online while she falls asleep. Once they&#39;re asleep my husband and I can spend some time together, talking or watching tv which was really important to him. We can easily adjust this if they want to stay up to watch a specific show or movie or something else they want to do. My husband doesn&#39;t feel like his &quot;rights&quot; are being infringed on and my kids fall asleep snuggled against me.

But <br/>\nthat&#39;s a long time between 9 and adult and an even longer time between 5 and <br/>\nadult. I think that the idea that there will be some quick and easy things to <br/>\ngrab that are yummy and run a smallish gamut of choices is about making it <br/>\neasier to get food when hungry. When Simon and Linnaea were younger they needed <br/>\nto eat much, much more frequently than they do now. Of course now they are on a <br/>\nslightly different sleep/wake cycle than I am which means that I do cook more <br/>\nmeals than I would if we all ate at the same time. I don&#39;t know, maybe there was <br/>\na point where joy slipped in, I mean, sure, sometimes I&#39;m tired and I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto cook pasta or bread and beans and cheese or whatever it is, but mostly I like <br/>\nfeeding Simon and Linnaea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat ways can you make it easier? Often cooking things up early in the day when <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t tired. Cakes and cookies, bagels and breads, challah is a lovely <br/>\nsnack and it looks so pretty, cut up vegetables that your kids like and keep <br/>\nthem floating in water in the fridge so that they are easy to grab, and still <br/>\ncrisp and fresh. It&#39;s good for carrots and celery and cauliflower and broccoli <br/>\nand you can have a bottle of ranch dressing or some hummus or something that is <br/>\na quick and yummy small meal. Apples and cheese, frozen grapes, frozen peas, <br/>\npeanut butter crackers, honey on crackers. Lots of easy and quick things to put <br/>\ntogether when you see a child moving toward hungry. At 5 the need for energy is <br/>\ngreater than the size of the stomach, so hungry is a bigger constant. And at 9, <br/>\nmoving toward the big growth spurts of the prepubertal and than pubertal years, <br/>\nlots of need for food. There are better lists than my moment of thinking <br/>\navailable. Maybe something someone else has written will help you to see ways to <br/>\n5 minutes of prep instead of seeing yourself as trapped in the kitchen: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/protein\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/protein</a> or <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter\">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a> or <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/food/convenientsnacks.html.\">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/food/convenientsnacks.html.</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEvenings alone? I don&#39;t even know how to address that one. David and I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave time alone in the evening. We get it in the morning, right now we are <br/>\nsitting on separate couches, with own laptops, and Simon and Linnaea are still <br/>\nsleeping. I&#39;ve read a couple of Philip Larkin poems to him and we&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout Truman Capote for a moment or two. But our time is, and has been for a <br/>\nlong time, in the margins of our family time. And the margins have become bigger <br/>\nas Simon and Linnaea have grown. But the margins usually included cooking <br/>\ntogether in the kitchen. Those conversations with one another as we made dinner <br/>\nwere largely between the two of us. We never really watched television that we <br/>\nweren&#39;t really willing to share with Simon and Linnaea. I suppose because we&#39;d <br/>\nbeen doing this for most of Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s lives there was never a time <br/>\nwhen we were adjusting to living with their constant presence. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night, as I lay in bed, I was thinking about how much more independent they <br/>\nare. I have to seek connections with them so much more actively than I did when <br/>\nthey were younger. And while they still seek connection with me, they are <br/>\ngrowing up and out and away. Inexorably. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi All,<br/>\nMy family has just finished our first week of deschooling.  My sons are 9 and <br/>\n5.  We have recently relaxed our rules about food, T.V. and bedtimes.  I have <br/>\nnot found my way yet with these changes and have a few questions for the group. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, is it part of the idea of food freedom that the kids have the <br/>\nresponsibility for preparing some of their food?  I know people talk about <br/>\nhaving lots of food choices in the house for kids to access themselves, but is <br/>\npart of the goal that they gain the power of being able to make it for <br/>\nthemselves?  The side note is that I feel like I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot making <br/>\nsnacks and meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, my husband and I were used to having the 9 – 10pm hour for visiting or <br/>\nwatching adult programming (not &quot;True Blood&quot; or anything just more adult <br/>\nlanguage and situation that I&#39;d like my 5 yo to see).  Previously the kids would <br/>\nhave been in bed at that point.  Now my 5 yo likes to come out and fall asleep <br/>\nnext to me on the couch.  Often this is fine but, and here is the question, how <br/>\ndoes one handle the situations when it is not okay for him to be out with us <br/>\nbecause we have decided to watch something inappropriate for him.  Is it enough <br/>\nto say that he doesn&#39;t have to go to sleep, but he has to stay out of the living <br/>\nroom because we are watching such and so and it might be too scary or have bad <br/>\nlanguage or whatever?  I think that I&#39;m trying to find the balance between their <br/>\nneeds and my needs and need a bit of guidance for outside.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":377201113,"authorName":"mitrisue","from":"&quot;mitrisue&quot; &lt;julesmiel@...&gt;","profile":"mitrisue","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Questions about balancing food choice and bedtimes","postDate":"1301126428","msgId":46415,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltazZlcytjNWJiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGltanJlYSsxZmllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46414,"nextInTopic":46416,"prevInTime":46414,"nextInTime":46416,"topicId":46414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Melissa. ...

Are you at all open to watching his reaction to having it on?  I&#39;ve found that &quot;American Dad&quot; is fine for Mitri.  I turned the first-day earthquake coverage off.  Why did I do that?  Did I have a good instinct about what would be too much for him, or was it too much for me?

Calling my needs &quot;my perceived needs&quot; helps me get into that question of what I truly need.  I also jump at any chance to do something fulfilling for me (or me and dh) when it looks like the kids are occupied and not needing us.  This means that the toilet does not get cleaned as often.  If someone is going to suffer here, it&#39;s going to be the toilet! <br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you a smooth transition,<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":386666394,"authorName":"melgqd","from":"&quot;melgqd&quot; &lt;boisei@...&gt;","profile":"melgqd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Questions about balancing food choice and bedtimes","postDate":"1301115146","msgId":46414,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltanJlYSsxZmllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46415,"prevInTime":46413,"nextInTime":46415,"topicId":46414,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, My family has just finished our first week of deschooling.

We have recently relaxed our rules about food, T.V. and bedtimes.  I have not found my way yet with these changes and have a few questions for the group. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, is it part of the idea of food freedom that the kids have the responsibility for preparing some of their food?  I know people talk about having lots of food choices in the house for kids to access themselves, but is part of the goal that they gain the power of being able to make it for themselves?  The side note is that I feel like I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot making snacks and meals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, my husband and I were used to having the 9  10pm hour for visiting or watching adult programming (not &quot;True Blood&quot; or anything just more adult language and situation that I&#39;d like my 5 yo to see).  Previously the kids would have been in bed at that point.  Now my 5 yo likes to come out and fall asleep next to me on the couch.  Often this is fine but, and here is the question, how does one handle the situations when it is not okay for him to be out with us because we have decided to watch something inappropriate for him.  Is it enough to say that he doesn&#39;t have to go to sleep, but he has to stay out of the living room because we are watching such and so and it might be too scary or have bad language or whatever?  I think that I&#39;m trying to find the balance between their needs and my needs and need a bit of guidance for outside.  <br/>\nThanks for listening,<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46383,"nextTopicId":46422}}
