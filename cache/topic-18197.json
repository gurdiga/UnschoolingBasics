This is his passion at the moment and has led <br/>\nto millions of projects and many fishing trips.  He is learning <br/>\nfishing knots, he is making flies, wooden bobbers, sinkers from <br/>\nbolts, he has numerous fishing poles, some bought and some he made.  <br/>\nwe learned how to make a reel fro a spool. However, he wants to go <br/>\nfishing all the time.  We go fishing in the evening after papa gets <br/>\nhome from work, we fish on weekends, we go to the fish hatcheries, we <br/>\ngo to the nearby river midweek.  We go fishing about 3 times a week <br/>\nright now, earlier it was every day.  My husband said, &quot;I always knew <br/>\nour kids would make us do what we always wanted to do&quot;.  However,  I <br/>\nfeel that I am getting worn out doing more than I can handle.  I need <br/>\nto stay at home often to care for our grandmother as well as work <br/>\nwhen all he want to do is fishing.  I just want to say NO, but <br/>\nsomehow drum up the last ounce of energy and go fishing yet again.  I <br/>\nam tired and his drive to go fishing is stronger than my energy level <br/>\nat this point.  He doesn&#39;t seem to care if I am tired or have other <br/>\nthings to do.  I&#39;m getting pretty good at recognizing if something I <br/>\nam doing is really all that important or not.  I guess this is his <br/>\nfirst interest that requires parental involvement at such a level <br/>\n(during his mailcarrier phase for instance, all I needed to do was <br/>\nkeep up the office supplies and gets one cent stamps periodically).  <br/>\nHow do parents encourage their child&#39;s interests while taking care of <br/>\ntheir own commitments, time and energy needs?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18179,"nextTopicId":18181}}
