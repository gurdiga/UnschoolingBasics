GameCube? etc There are some games that are <br/>\navailable for multiple platforms but most of the time they are <br/>\nspecific to one or the other. For the computer, there&#39;s Age of <br/>\nEmpires (I think there are 4 in that series). For PS2, one favorite <br/>\nthat ties in with other things you noted, is Lego Star Wars 1 & 2. <br/>\nYes, there are light saber battles and blasters and all. However, <br/>\nall the characters are Lego figures and they just fall into pieces <br/>\nwhen shot or whatever - no blood involved (Legos don&#39;t have blood <br/>\nlol). Also, look up brikwars.com - it&#39;s not a videogame, it&#39;s a Lego-<br/>\nbased battle/strategy game where you build the scenario and use dice <br/>\nto battle with your opponent. It&#39;s really cool - you&#39;d love it since <br/>\nthe little people are a big part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW I still cannot play most videogames since I get dizzy/queasy <br/>\nwith a lot of the motion. However, I did just start playing Pokemon <br/>\nBlue (really old, I know, I know) on DS&#39; Gameboy (we now have 2 GBA <br/>\nSP systems and 2 Nintendo DS systems so there&#39;s usually something I <br/>\ncan play on even though DH and DS are the main gamers in the house). <br/>\nDS said that would probably be the easiest thing for me to play - I <br/>\ncan move fast or slow and it isn&#39;t dizzying speed or really fast <br/>\nreaction times or anything involved. He was so proud of me (and I <br/>\nwas proud of me too) when I caught my first wild Pokemon (a Pidgey I <br/>\nnamed Pudgey. My &quot;main&quot; Pokemon is a charmander named Charley). <br/>\nSince I can&#39;t play many of the games DH and DS like, sometimes I <br/>\ncan&#39;t even be nearby because I catch the motion out of my peripheral <br/>\nvision, I do try to keep up with what they like, what the <br/>\ncharacters&#39; names and abilities are, and so on and keep my eye out <br/>\nfor related stuff (like when we picked up a Pokedex book for DS just <br/>\nfor fun - he was head over heels and still keeps that thing handy) <br/>\nor when I noticed that there were two new Pokemon games set to <br/>\nrelease so we went and pre-ordered them. Don&#39;t necessarily have to <br/>\nplay all the games to at least be &#39;literate&#39; about them and <br/>\ninterested in listening to and participating in discussion about <br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":261389317,"authorName":"Vanessa","from":"&quot;Vanessa&quot; &lt;nessa_at_home@...&gt;","profile":"nessa_at_home","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Oh!
