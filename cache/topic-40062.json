My partner and I have both worked from home off and on - although currently I&#39;m working full time outside the home, he&#39;s the at-home parent, and trying to juggle his work around that. Its a challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ideas George and I have both struggled with and had to let go of, was an expectation that our kids would learn &quot;important things&quot; from our work at home. Kids learn all manner of things all day long, regardless of what we do or don&#39;t do. We can&#39;t always predict what they&#39;ll learn when - that&#39;s part of the theoretical underpinnings of unschooling right there! And there&#39;s no way to guarantee that they&#39;ll learn what we&#39;d Like them to learn. One of the marvelous parts of unschooling is getting to go on journeys of the mind that we wouldn&#39;t have taken were it not for our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own life I&#39;ve found it helpful to step away from my ideas of how and what the kids could learn from the family businesses and instead to look for ways to strengthen our sense of mutual supportiveness as a family - ways that aren&#39;t tied in to the work part, necessarily. We&#39;ve found ways for the kids to have space in the work areas that are about them, not about &quot;business&quot;. I&#39;m sure there are ways to do that with home childcare, too - the hardest part may be the mental shift away from the assumption that your kids will necessarily *want* to be involved. They might, especially if they tend to be social. But they could just as easily wish they didn&#39;t have to share mom all day with a bunch of other kids. Supporting *those* kinds of feelings is essential. The last thing you want your kids to learn, I&#39;m sure, is that other kids are more important to their mom than their own needs and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, there&#39;s very likely a way to create an environment where your kids can feel supported while you work from home - its challenging, but many other unschooling families include home businesses, some of them childcare related! So I&#39;m sure its possible. As your kids get older, and their needs become more separate from those of the kids you take care of during the day, it may well be easier - it will be clearer what&#39;s &quot;for the big kids&quot; for example. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;teach my children empathy, how to compromise/share, take care of others <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts good to know that a lot of these kinds of behaviors are related to development and personality. Empathy, compassion, seeing from someone else&#39;s pov - those all take some emotional reserves of security and a sense of supportedness. Kid&#39;s reserves aren&#39;t as big as adults - and how much empathy do adults have when they&#39;re under stress? Humans are naturally caring of other humans - When we are Able to be. From an unschooling standpoint, that means if you want kids to be able to show empathy and care, its vital to heap them with empathy and care first. <br/>\n<br/>\nModeling does help, but its important to realize what constitutes modeling from a child&#39;s perspective - its really only what you are saying or doing *to* that exact child. Lecturing to a child about sharing models lecturing. Pushing a child to be polite models pushing. Holding firm to an ideal models stubborness! But being gracious and thoughtful when a child is having a lousy moment models grace and thoughfulness. Looking for creative ways to meet needs models creative problem solving. And being kind and thoughtful and gracious not only models those things, it feeds a child&#39;s needs for care, making them better able to be caring, themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?","postDate":"1242414878","msgId":40086,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1a2V1dSszYnI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1aGJiditwcHNuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40085,"nextInTopic":40087,"prevInTime":40085,"nextInTime":40087,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************************************** One of the things that can happen is that when you start creating more options, being more open to what s possible,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1770485124\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jennifercroce37&quot; &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am seeing an increase in anger, tantrums and rudeness from my children when I try to be more open to letting them do and explore the things that interest them. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that can happen is that when you start creating more options, being more open to what&#39;s possible, your kids start to express more of their less pleasant feelings - things they may have learned to &quot;tone down&quot; in the past. Its a good sign, in some ways - even though its disconcerting. They&#39;re trusting you a bit more, and they&#39;re feeling safe to explore some of those other feelings, the ones kids are often not &quot;supposed&quot; to show around adults. Acknowledge those feelings and take them seriously (although, naturally, do what&#39;s needed to keep people safe).<br/>\n<br/>\n Try to ascertain what the child in question needs/wants from you - to be reassured? appologised to? to be given time to vent? My 15yo has always preferred to do something really physical when he&#39;s upset, so we&#39;ve helped him find tools in that direction. My 7yo needs time alone, but also needs to cry. Different personalities. One of the wonderful opportunities you have, now, is to help your kids figure out what their best strategies are for dealing with big, uncomfortable emotions. <br/>\n<br/>\n3 and 7 are both somewhat transitional years, too. Around 3 kids tend to start to push outward noticably more - they become more aware of the world outside the home and family and start wanting to make more decisions about their lives. Around 7 kids go through a similar transition, starting to want to do more mature things without, often, having a sense of exactly what it is they want. So those factors are also going to contribute to more emotional upset - the 7yo wants new and different and the 3yo wants to be in charge. It can help to look for ways to meet those needs - the deep underlying needs - rather than simply the needs of the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a very difficult time accommodating both their needs/interests sinced they often conflict and I am often alone with them.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nJuggling needs can be challenging! It helps to think ahead as much as possible - see which needs you can meet proactively instead of being stuck reacting all the time. That&#39;s one of the biggest skills of being an unschooling parent, learning how to be proactive. Those big, developmental needs, especially, are worth thinking about in terms of being proactive. Having more ways to meet those can make a big difference in the day to day stuff - its easier to compromise when Most of your needs are being met already.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what your setup is, wrt the daycare thing, but one of the things that can help streamline your life is to make your home as kid-friendly as possible. Make sure your kids can get serving size snacks and drinks without having to ask for help (but help if they ask!), that their favorite art supplies, toys and games are easy for them to get on their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;letting go of my own needs <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helps *me* to think in terms of finding alternative ways to meet my needs, rather than letting go of them. Mom&#39;s needs are important! I look for ways to meet my own needs proactively, whenever I can, and I&#39;ve come to trust Myself that when I delay my own gratification, its Just a delay. I&#39;ll get my [nap, snack, shower, backrub, time to check my email, whatever!] eventually. It also helps me to look at *my* bigger, deeper needs and work to meet Those needs consistently. Then I can stretch more for the small stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the hardest thing for me is doing this alone and not having adequate time to recover from the stress of day to day life.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********************<br/>\n<br/>\nRecovery time is sooooo important. Look for ways to catch little moments of special time for yourself during the day. Get or do something special just for you - even if its just a cute windchime or some scented soap. Something that that makes you smile or lightens your heart a little. Take a few moments, now and then during the day, to take a few slow breaths and touch base with yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I am beginning to think a true unschooling lifestyle isn&#39;t possible for my family and am ready to throw in the towel.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nHappily, there&#39;s No One True Way to unschool. Every family is unique. It helped me to stop looking at the idea of unschooling itself, and start looking more at ways to bring kindness and joy into my life and family. Find those things that are important to you - your guiding principles - and cultivate those.

It&#39;s a bummer that she was talked out of it if she wanted bangs so much. In hot weather they can be clipped back in a cute styley barrette. It&#39;s not really that big of a deal. Maybe she could go back and get them if she&#39;s still wanting that? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a parent, I consider it part of my job to &quot;be in my son&#39;s corner&quot; when it comes to his wants and needs. The other day we (me and dad) had to convince the hair cutter that our son, 9 yrs old, really did want his long, blond curly locks shaved off. (Because he loves the punk rock look) He just got his ears pierced and he wanted short hair to go with it. Even though I *love* his long hair, he looks really cute and he&#39;s particularly happy with his choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son went to school too--k-2nd grade--and I was reading all I could everywhere about unschooling. I can really relate to the struggles you&#39;re going thru in that regard. <br/>\nMy partner and I did some things that made our lives easier at that time. We took *a lot* of days off--not to the point truancy, but here and there, they were very valuable for our boy. <br/>\nAlso, we just did our son&#39;s homework for him--told him the answers or even wrote it for him, with a little note: &quot;Kevin was too tired to write, so he dictated&quot;. We&#39;d casually talk with the teacher before school and say, &quot;We didn&#39;t get the homework done.&quot; And if the teacher said *anything* I&#39;d say, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve been kind of busy lately and the homework is creating struggles in my family that I&#39;m not willing to do, so I&#39;m going to let these pages go for now. I&#39;m not going to make him do them.&quot; If the teacher objected and tried to tell me that I was &quot;negatively affecting my son&#39;s study ability in the future&quot;, I&#39;d repeat it. I was not willing to bring homework struggles into my family time. (I didn&#39;t take my son out at that time because me and my partner weren&#39;t on the same page yet. He was still thinking that school was good, even though he was against homework.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt; &quot;My hubby is on board with unschooling, but I don&#39;t think his work focus will ever change. I am hopeful that living an unschooled life will help him with his priorities and see what is really important in life.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>His priorities are to provide for you all. That&#39;s a pretty cool priority! Way better than the opposite! :) It makes it possible to do the things you do. As he gets settled with his business, I&#39;ll bet it will be easier--still busy during the yr at times, but with unschooling, family time is way more flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Juillet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Skills taught from running a daycare and \tunschooling","postDate":"1242395347","msgId":40080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwNTE1MDY0OWkxODk5YTg3ZXZiODkxMGYzNDYxYWY0NTY3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5Mjk1OC43MzYxOS5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDczMjIzOS40Njk5OC5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwMi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+IDwyMjg0NjIuNTgwNTQucW1Ad2ViODE1MDUubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiAJPDE2NzcyMi4zMDkxMC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxNC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw5MTg4MDUuMTQxNDEucW1Ad2ViNDUzMTMubWFpbC5zcDEueWFob28uY29tPiAJPDE5Mjk1OC43MzYxOS5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40079,"nextInTopic":40081,"prevInTime":40079,"nextInTime":40081,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, May 14, 2009 at 8:52 PM, Jennifer Croce ...

You are forcing into a situation of socializing with different ages groups, not letting her explore them. Especially if you are not giving her options/choices. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter actually quite enjoys the daycare children.  She likes reading to them, playing with them and helping to take care of them.  In fact, the idea of homeschooling came about because she was home with me one day while I was working and she was a completely different kid.  Seeing how confident and happy she was made me wonder what it would be like if she was home all the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this arrangement may get tiresome when she is exposed to it day in and day out.  Luckily, our house is big and she has the option of playing in her room (not used for daycare) be downstairs if we are upstairs or vice versa or play outside.  I am very up front and talk with her about the times where it will be chaotic/busy/ I can&#39;t get or give her what she wants and that there will be times where she wishes she was at school.  I explained that the &quot;work&quot; next year is going to be different in that she won&#39;t be doing worksheets and taking tests, but finding out what interests her and learning to do things, play, learn on her own.  I tell her she is her own best teacher.  I explain that I will be here to guide, support and do things with her but there are unfortunately still some limits.  The daycare kids nap/rest from about 12:30-2:30 so I will have time to spend with her one on one.  Plus, I have Fridays off and am done by 3:30pm<br/>\n so it still gives us time to do things together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest adjustment is not having from the moment she gets up to the moment she goes to bed scheduled for her.  Letting go of the structure and limits is difficult even though it is something we don&#39;t like.  For example, last month my husband and I went to NYC for the weekend.  It was the first time we had gone away alone in 4 years and it was the first time I was away overnight from my youngest (who will be 3 in August)  since she was born.  I was so excited to have some time with my husband, have uninterrupted sleep and sleep past 5:30am.  However, once I got to the hotel I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness and felt completely lost.  I didn&#39;t know what to do, it was a very unsettling feeling.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt; Keep in mind it is a lifestyle not a homeschooling method. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat fact is what prompted my original post which is can I have an unschooling lifestyle given my current circumstances.  I am learning the answer is no which is OK. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJen <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ Ross","from":"&quot;JJ Ross&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Skills taught from running a daycare and unschooling","postDate":"1242393310","msgId":40079,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1anBzdStmZmg3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5Mjk1OC43MzYxOS5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40076,"nextInTopic":40080,"prevInTime":40078,"nextInTime":40080,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At this point I hear little in your situation to build on as a foundation, not even unschooling basics much less toward joyful unschooling.

If your daughter is struggling so much with public school pull her now and let her start deschooling. It may take longer than you think. Let her relax and decompress from all the stress it is obiviously causing her. Why keep her some place that isn&#39;t happy for a few more weeks when she could spend those weeks with you at home surrounded by peace and love. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou will also need to deschool and learn to let go of a lot of things. If you don&#39;t want to officially pull her on mornings when she is really struggling and not wanting to go, let her stay home. What is the school really going to do since you intend to do some kind of homeschooling anyway? If unschooling is the path you really want to go down then you need to make sure that your children are on board as well. Ask them how they feel about having other kids on a school schedule around them. Ask yourself how much of that schedule you will be able to just be with your kids and not taking care of someone elses. I do realize that extra income can be necessary but if need be make a list of what is important to you and your family. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe socialization would be forced and really no different than if you kept her in school. You are forcing into a situation of socializing with different ages groups, not letting her explore them. Especially if you are not giving her options/choices. She would not have as many options of places to hang out in her own home with other children present. I know you have stated that you are aware of the negatives of having a day care in your home while trying to unschool and that you consider yourself more eclectic than unschooling. But you really do have to focus on being with your children to make the transition. Keep in mind it is a lifestyle not a homeschooling method. Living life and finding the joys in moments. Giving your children the opportunity to explore the world around them in ways that they enjoy. Sharing all of that with them and building a loving, trusting relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk..time is up, snacks, drinks, and daughter are waiting for me. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Carson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336564039,"authorName":"Jennifer Croce","from":"Jennifer Croce &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt;","profile":"jennifercroce37","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Skills taught from running a daycare and unschooling","postDate":"1242352365","msgId":40074,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Mjk1OC43MzYxOS5xbUB3ZWI0NjAwNy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxODgwNS4xNDE0MS5xbUB3ZWI0NTMxMy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDczMjIzOS40Njk5OC5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwMi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+IDwyMjg0NjIuNTgwNTQucW1Ad2ViODE1MDUubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPiA8MTY3NzIyLjMwOTEwLnFtQHdlYjQ2MDE0Lm1haWwuc3AxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDkxODgwNS4xNDE0MS5xbUB3ZWI0NTMxMy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40073,"nextInTopic":40076,"prevInTime":40073,"nextInTime":40075,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I think that running a home daycare will help teach my children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-646722102\">&lt; What valuable skills will your daughter learn from having you run a day care in your home? &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that running a home daycare will help teach my children empathy, how to compromise/share, take care of others and it provides peer interaction in a safer setting than public school.  I believe running a home daycare provides my children with a truer sense of socialization since one of the meanings of socialization means to develop social skills that allows a person to function in society or the &quot;real world&quot;.  My children are exposed to children younger than them and interact with the daycare parents who are older.  In school my older daughter in a group that is comprised of children her age and more or less same socio-economic status (since schools are usually grouped by neighborhoods).   The &quot;real world&quot; is obviously much more diverse and I think she will be more comfortable since she is getting more diverse exposure at an earlier age.  I also think it is important for my children to see me work and contribute financially to<br/>\n our family, especially since they are girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am very aware of the negative implication of running a daycare and having other children in our home.  I also know my children can learn the above mentioned skills without me running a daycare.  I have worked hard to make my schedule as family oriented as possible (operating on the school calendar, ending at 3:30pm and working 4 days a week).  The families enrolled have been extremely respectful and cooperative with my schedule and requirement to meet my family&#39;s needs first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDue to the nature of my husband&#39;s work it is nearly impossible for me to work outside the home. I wouldn&#39;t be able to homeschool as easily if I worked outside the home, and I think it would be a lot harder on my family if I did.  In this day and age and with my husband being self employed any extra income is beneficial and doing this takes a bit of the pressure off of him (I realize I make a drop in the bucket compared to him, but he has said he feels better with me working even though it is minimal).  I feel it is because of the situation we are now in that we are able to homeschool/unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\n I am not claiming to be a radical unschooler and feel it is more accurate to say I am an eclectic homeschooler especially since this September will be our first year of homeschooling.  I see the unschooling lifestyle as the ideal and is the goal I am striving for.  I/we have a lot of schooling/parenting/conventional life baggage to let go of and it will be a long slow process, but I am hopeful about getting there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Tammy Curry &lt;mamabeart00@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Thursday, May 14, 2009 9:05:36 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat valuable skills will your daughter learn from having you run a day care in your home?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the example of the day at the park, it might have just been too much running around after a long day at school.

If your DH is gone much but wants to unschool, it can work - but if he is resistant, you&#39;ll need to try to get on the same page, or at least the same chapter. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201262326,"authorName":"Rala Brubaker","from":"Rala Brubaker &lt;kravmamma@...&gt;","profile":"kravmamma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?","postDate":"1242337559","msgId":40073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4NDYxMS4yNjM3MC5xbUB3ZWI0NTQwMy5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40072,"nextInTopic":40074,"prevInTime":40072,"nextInTime":40074,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Jen, I am Rala.  I also struggle with a lot of these issues.  I too immediately saw a rise in anger, physical violence between my dd 7 and ds 6, and my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-184914921\">Hi Jen,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Rala.  I also struggle with a lot of these issues.  I too immediately saw a rise in anger, physical violence between my dd 7 and ds 6, and my kids are polar opposites.  I feel that often there is no way to say yes to both of them.  They are very spirited kids and I have watched my ds literally take the opposing view or desire stance just to get at my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our process i have begun to insist on only a few things.  1.  I have final say in health or safety matters.  we will talk the issue whatever all the way through but in the end it is my choice.  We have so far always come to a consensus with the exception of ds wanting to eat sugar straight from the bowl.  I just got rid of the sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Everyone must be respectful of others or take themselves out of the group.  In the beginning I had to assist with the leaving a few times.  But I just went with the struggling child and spent one on one time with them while talking about how its always easier to get <br/>\nour private time needs met when we use our words and ask for it instead of doing something angry, mean or hurtful to someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my &quot;tweaks&quot; on the unschooling lifestyle and so far so good.  i know that alot of people on unschooling basics choose a much more lax style but this is what works for us and allows us to all be together and meet Everyones needs.  Yours are important too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRala<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 5/14/09, jennifercroce37 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jennifercroce37@...\">jennifercroce37@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 14, 2009, 8:54 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            <br/>\n            <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n      Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been doing a lot of research on unschooling and hope to transform our lifestyle and parenting to this philosophy.

Anyone who has made the transition knows it is not easy. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhile I think most people can, with work/patience/ love/letting go, make this transition, I think you have two things pulling against you right now. The first is DHs work situation. I think that it&#39;s importantthat you are both completely on board with unschooling and the level of chage you&#39;ll have to go through for this work. Maybe he is on board and I am mis-interpreting your email; but if he is focused so much on work, it will be hard for him to exercise the control needed to get a new business running during the day and then drop that control completely at night. It might be best to continue deschooling and letting go of structure gradually until he is able to me more present. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other challenege for you is the day care. Unless it&#39;s an unschooling day care (which, by the way, might be a great idea for you!), this could really set up a confusing situation for all involved. I would imagine that the parents of the kids you care for have certain expectations in terms of activities, meals, TV, etc, that require some more traditional parental control methods. If that is the case, your own children may be receiving mixed signals, which means they will have to make transitions and assumptions that are hard for a 3 and 7 year old to make.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll that said, maybe the answer for you is &quot;Yes, but slowly until we can sort some things out.&quot; Unschooling does look different in every family, for sure. Maybe when DH&#39;s business takes hold things will get easier, and then you&#39;ll be able to focus on reconciling the day care situation? <br/>\n <br/>\nGo to the conferences, read the books, talk to other unschoolers who have done it before. <br/>\n <br/>\nHoping for a good outcome for all - <br/>\n <br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n--- On Thu, 5/14/09, jennifercroce37 &lt;jennifercroce37@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt;jennifercroce37@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 14, 2009, 7:54 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been doing a lot of research on unschooling and hope to transform our lifestyle and parenting to this philosophy.

When my daughter got home from school I suggested we go get hair cuts, she agreed and was excited to get &quot;fancy hair&quot; (she has wanted to get bangs and color her hair).  When we got to the hairdresser she talked my daughter out of  trying bangs (not great to have in the summer and something to try in the fall/winter when it isn&#39;t so hot and sticky) and said they don&#39;t color hair unless you are at least 16 years old.  She did style her hair a bit differently so she looked &quot;fancy&quot;.  After the hair cuts my oldest asked if we could go in the dollar store so I said sure.  Then we stopped to play at the park, when we got to the parking lot my oldest started to scream and cry because I didn&#39;t bring her bike.  I didn&#39;t have room in the car to bring it, but told her we could either play at the park, go to a different park or go home to get the bike but that would take some time away from<br/>\n playing since it would take time to go home, unload the car to fit the bikes and get back to the park.  She was having a huge tantrum, screaming at me that I was mean and getting her sister upset because the younger one just wanted to get out and start playing.  I did go home and get the bike and we stayed at the park for about an hour.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe day before this I took her to a different park to play and ride her bike and yet another park on Monday afternoon. All these park trip were in the late afternoon when I would have usually just stayed home and had them play outside while I got dinner ready.  The weather here the past few days has been wonderful so I felt dinner could be a little later and we could take advantage of the nice weather.  The girls had snacks in the afternoon so they weren&#39;t starved.  All three nights my husband worked late so I was doing this on my own.  Instead of being happy at being able to be at the park she was focused on not having her bike.  When I tried to work with her to come up with a solution that made her happy she just got angrier and nasty.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":336564039,"authorName":"Jennifer Croce","from":"Jennifer Croce &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt;","profile":"jennifercroce37","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?","postDate":"1242322565","msgId":40070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NzcyMi4zMDkxMC5xbUB3ZWI0NjAxNC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyODQ2Mi41ODA1NC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDczMjIzOS40Njk5OC5xbUB3ZWI1NTgwMi5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+IDwyMjg0NjIuNTgwNTQucW1Ad2ViODE1MDUubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40069,"nextInTopic":40071,"prevInTime":40069,"nextInTime":40071,"topicId":40062,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-173365046\">&lt; Having a husband that works a lot will not be a problem.

Maybe he is on board and I am mis-interpreting your email; but if he is focused so much on work, it will be hard for him to exercise the control needed to get a new business running during the day and then drop that control completely at night. It might be best to continue deschooling and letting go of structure gradually until he is able to me more present. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe other challenege for you is the day care. Unless it&#39;s an unschooling day care (which, by the way, might be a great idea for you!), this could really set up a confusing situation for all involved. I would imagine that the parents of the kids you care for have certain expectations in terms of activities, meals, TV, etc, that require some more traditional parental control methods. If that is the case, your own children may be receiving mixed signals, which means they will have to make transitions and assumptions that are hard for a 3 and 7 year old to make.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll that said, maybe the answer for you is &quot;Yes, but slowly until we can sort some things out.&quot; Unschooling does look different in every family, for sure. Maybe when DH&#39;s business takes hold things will get easier, and then you&#39;ll be able to focus on reconciling the day care situation? <br/>\n <br/>\nGo to the conferences, read the books, talk to other unschoolers who have done it before. <br/>\n <br/>\nHoping for a good outcome for all - <br/>\n <br/>\nJeff<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Thu, 5/14/09, jennifercroce37 &lt;jennifercroce37@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: jennifercroce37 &lt;jennifercroce37@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Is an unschooling lifestyle possible given my circumstances?<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\nDate: Thursday, May 14, 2009, 7:54 AM<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been doing a lot of research on unschooling and hope to transform our lifestyle and parenting to this philosophy.
