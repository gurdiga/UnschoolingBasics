I can sit between both tables to be close to everyone or at the little table with Kanoa so I can easily help him with his needs and still talk to whoever else is eating at the bigger table.  I can take even more part in a conversation and have more connection with others when I am closer to meet my youngest&#39;s needs more easily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to hold Kanoa on my lap (or dh would hold him on his lap) while we ate, but as he got older he prefered to stand and eat by the little table.  I think standing makes it easier for him to leave to play for a bit and then come back for another bite.  As long as he is safe and happy, I can eat my dinner.  If he moves to a place where I can&#39;t see him, I take a bite and check on him or bring my plate to where he is (or dh does).      <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes dh and I take turns eating as our little guy might need to move about or play and this way one of us can hang out with him while the other eats.  This gives one of us a chance to eat and the other to have nice one on one time with him.  After dinner is over and cleaned up we can all hang out together.  It won&#39;t always be like this, this is what we feel works best for our family while we have a youngster. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kanoa is interested in a dvd though (whether in the living room or on a portable dvd on the little sized table), dh and I and the rest of the family (if they are interested) can eat at the same time.  If he&#39;s in the living room and we eat in there, then we&#39;ll offer him food while we&#39;re eating or set him up with his little table in there.  Or I&#39;ll hold his food and give him bites between my own eating.  (Soon our family can have picnics on the floor again.  Right now this doesn&#39;t work with an active toddler, but this will soon again be a fun way to eat and enjoy a movie).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe leave Kanoa&#39;s food out even after we&#39;ve cleaned up in case he gets hungry a little later.  And if I sense he didn&#39;t like what we had,  I&#39;ll offer something I think he might like such as yogurt or a smoothie or a roll or fruit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Toddler troubles","postDate":"1298220590","msgId":46207,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqcmduZSt1NGV0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAyYjAwMWNiZDA1OSQ1ZDBiMjdiMCQxNzIxNzcxMCRAY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46200,"nextInTopic":46212,"prevInTime":46206,"nextInTime":46208,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Leaving out plates of snacks can help with that.

I don&#39;t have to share that through words if both of them are busy being loud.  I can have my chance at words later when it calms down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still get irritable.

Notice when they Are being helpful, from their perspective. My 9yo is terribly helpful, but not always in ways that are convenient from an adult perspective. She&#39;s great at reminding adults what needs to be done - how thoughtful of her! But it&#39;s important that I remind myself that she&#39;s being thoughtful, now and then, or I can become very irritated that she&#39;s &quot;just&quot; telling me and not doing it herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow and then I&#39;ll say &quot;help me pick this up before so-and-so comes over so there&#39;s a place to play/sit down/eat&quot; - not a question, but not an order, either. I&#39;d say the same thing to a friend or a co-worker &quot;give me a hand with this&quot;. If your kids resist that kind of thing, that&#39;s a sign to back waaaaaay off on &quot;asking&quot; for any kind of help and let them get comfortable with the idea of helping out on their own terms - and try to see things from their perspective so you notice!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My boys are very rude to each other. They always fight and always call names. What do I do about this.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do they think? Should you do anything at all? Maybe you didn&#39;t have a brother just a year apart from you in age to know this, but boys tend to play on the rough side. It doesn&#39;t really matter if that&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; or cultural, its normal, if you see what I mean. Have you ever listened to Car Talk or watched some show that involved a close relationship between brothers? If they&#39;re just trading insults (as opposed to, say, punches) then it may be totally fine. They&#39;re working out the parameters of their relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; On to the toddler. Do you allow your toddler to eat what ever, when ever? I have tried removing restrictions but...it seems she just wants choc, animal crackers and goldfish.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember that stage ;) I made a point to get the best quality animals crackers, goldfish and beverages I could find. Really - if she&#39;ll eat the whole-grain, less sugar and salt stuff you&#39;ll feel better and that will let you step back and bit a little more objective. Does she drink juice? That&#39;s vitamins and fiber. Does she drink milk? You&#39;ve got your proteins and fats. Is that *all* she eats or is there more? Mo went through a stage where that was *all* - no hyperbole - but most of the time kids actually do eat more than that, it just falls through convenient cracks in parental memory ;) But be reassured that even if its *all* she eats, its not a crisis. If you really panic, you can offer vitamins, too but its muuuuuuch better not to start power struggles over food. Those do a lot more damage in the long run than animal crackers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; The big thing I am wondering about is potty training.

She&#39;s been replaced! She was the baby! Offer her more chances to be babied. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, realize that 2 is still pretty little for consistent independent pottying. She may need a break from so much hard, grown-up attention to detail. Don&#39;t stress it and look for ways to make clean up easier. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Toddler troubles","postDate":"1298035951","msgId":46173,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDOTI5NkJCLTdFOTktNEVFRS1CREQ4LTBCQzdFQTRCRTMyNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqa2NnZytqZGhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqa2NnZytqZGhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46172,"nextInTopic":46174,"prevInTime":46172,"nextInTime":46174,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Anytime you ask, it was a question, a request instead of a demand. You are just starting down this path. It may take a while before they even think about helping you. Ask infrequently and be prepared for no and surprised by any yes that my come along. The longer you give them of being fine with their no the more likely they will be to say yes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The other question about the boys come to play and sharing. My boys are very rude to each other. They always fight and always call names. What do I do about this. I have done my best to change activities and move on but that isn&#39;t working. There is a ton of name calling and it bothers me. &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does it bother them? Are they playing? Simon and Linnaea call each other names occasionally and often they are joking with each other.  There isn&#39;t any real meanness in it, and if it goes across the line and one or the other perceives it as being meant horrible, I step in and talk about teasing and harassment and how it isn&#39;t a game when only one person is playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t playing that kind of tension is an indicator that they need more parental involvement. You need to be more present and be more aware of when tensions are mounting. You need to make sure they aren&#39;t lacking in any basic needs like food or drink or sleep. If they are getting on each other&#39;s last nerve you need to find, earlier, quicker ways to get them moving away from each other and toward doing something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharing isn&#39;t really sharing if there aren&#39;t options. It&#39;s more tolerated theft. Protect each boys right to what they are doing by having fewer requirements that they do it together. Linnaea was a burden that I placed on Simon when David and I chose to have a second child. She was my and David&#39;s choice, not his. So I&#39;ve done lots to protect his sovereignty in his own home as well as hers. Helping them to not have to play together has been one of those things. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I use to yell at them that it isn&#39;t nice but I know that is not the way. It is so hard when you have been this way for years. I am a work in progress. I am working on my own temper and my own actions.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really good. It&#39;s really good to figure out other ways to get peace in your home than by making the tension greater. It took me a while to figure out how to be calm in the face of distrubance. And I still have to work on it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;Maybe once I correct myself the boys will follow?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It will certainly play a role. But better to help them to be more peaceful by engaging them more and by making sure that they have food and drink regularly. Those things make a world of difference. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; On to the toddler. Do you allow your toddler to eat what ever, when ever? I have tried removing restrictions but...it seems she just wants choc, animal crackers and goldfish. Do I allow her to continue eating this way in hopes that it will get old and she will move on? &lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>With toddler Linnaea and toddler Simon we did let them eat what they wanted. We offered lots of things that they might not have known were options as well. Simon loved lemon slices. He would suck on those as he walked around the kitchen. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut toddlers are doing intensive brain growth as well as bone and muscle growth. Their dietary needs are actually quite different from an adult human. Sugar and fats are brilliant for that kind of development. Offer her lots of things that you think she&#39;ll like. Cake is good. Finger foods are good. Beans or edamame or apple slices with cinnamon and sugar on them. Simon and Linnaea both still like apple as it would be for pie filling, so with flour and sugar and cinnamon mixed on top. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe will get older and move on in some ways. But I still quite like chocolate and bread sticks and animal crackers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Yes, we are new and before unschooling there was lots of control, now I see that was wrong.

If you go gently into unschooling there is less or a taut spring response. If you&#39;ve already made a public announcement, just be aware that there will be a period of intense readjustment. And hang on, and breathe and do all that you can to ride it out. It will get smoother, like ripples on a pond. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337268401,"authorName":"Amanda","from":"&quot;Amanda&quot; &lt;amanda_mendenhall@...&gt;","profile":"saabgirl88","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Toddler troubles","postDate":"1297986896","msgId":46159,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqa2NnZytqZGhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46169,"prevInTime":46158,"nextInTime":46160,"topicId":46159,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been searching all the past post and got tired of looking.
