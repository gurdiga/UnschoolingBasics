They were 2 years apart exactly and the 2yo (now 10) was entering a<br/>\nvery intense phase just as the new baby was being rather intense.  They are<br/>\nstill intense children but at the time the chemistry of it all including my<br/>\npost partum condition seamed a bit overwhelming.  I can remember thinking<br/>\nthat I couldn&#39;t possibly give older ds the attention he craved and that dd&#39;s<br/>\nneeds seemed more pressing all the time.  He did learn to wait and of<br/>\ncourse, she didn&#39;t stay a baby and he didn&#39;t stay a 2yo.  By the time they<br/>\nwere 3 and 1 they were beginning to interact with each other in ways that<br/>\nnurtured them both (not all the time mind you).  But I came to see their<br/>\nrelationship with each other as a dimension that more than made up for my<br/>\ninability to give them each my undivided attention 24-7.    The third child<br/>\nis the most independent of them all and she has been adored by all 4 of us,<br/>\nnot just me, from the beginning.<br/>\nOne thing that helped at least in the earliest years was to encourage their<br/>\nown relationship in little ways.  The 2 oldest tandem nursed and I used to<br/>\nsay &quot;soft baby head&quot; as the older one stroked her head gently or they&#39;d hold<br/>\nhands while they nursed.  I told the older children when #3 was born that<br/>\nthey should try to teach her to smile.  So they both would smile at the baby<br/>\nendlessly, which translated to tender feelings. There&#39;s more, good and bad,<br/>\nbut that&#39;s all I wanted to say for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKrisula</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":813,"nextTopicId":828}}
