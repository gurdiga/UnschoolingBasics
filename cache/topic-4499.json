Currently, I use the Homeschool  Tracker <br/>\ndownload.  It looks professional and I really don&#39;t have to fill in  much <br/>\ninformation.  It depends on your state, but my state law is very vague  and I take <br/>\nadvantage of that.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are some people here that are great at &quot;education-ese&quot; and can make  <br/>\nanything sound like it came from a university lesson planner!  I just look  at <br/>\nthe subjects my state requires and see what we did that day that fits the  <br/>\ncriteria.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor example, yesterday my kids played with caterpillars, fixed a bike chain  <br/>\nthat keeps breaking, played a dinosaur board game, watched PBS, watched a  <br/>\nneighbor build a fence and played restaurant.  I don&#39;t usually do this  type of <br/>\nbreakdown, but to illustrate how I translate their day to subjects I&#39;ll  be <br/>\nmore thorough.  So, Science is easy.....caterpillar study, simple  machinery, <br/>\ndinosaur study, Zooboomafoo, physical structures and nutrition.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMath:  comparison and estimation (differences in caterpillars, how  many they <br/>\nfound yesterday vs. today, etc.); probability (when will the bike  chain come <br/>\noff again), board game: counting, planning, more/less; PBS:  watched <br/>\nCyberchase; fence: geometry; restaurant: estimation.<br/>\n <br/>\nSocial Studies: bike chain: the value of helping each other; board game:  <br/>\npersonal interaction, helping out someone who is behind, winning/losing, board  <br/>\ngame ethics/rules, game also had dinosaur fights with winners and losers based  <br/>\non criteria like strength, habitat, intelligence;  PBS: watched social  <br/>\nsituations on Arthur, Barney, Sagwa; fence: good neighbors, why do people have  <br/>\nfences, other family interactions (they were building the fence together),  <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s reactions to the fence; restaurant: duplicating social  activity.<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce you start investigating, you can see that everyday activities often  <br/>\ncover nearly every school subject.  How can you live a single day without  social <br/>\nstudies?  Without science or math?  Sometimes you have to get  creative to <br/>\nturn it into school language.  Every day my kids ask what the  weather will be <br/>\nso they know what to wear......that&#39;s science!  I don&#39;t  know about you, but I <br/>\nremember studying weather in school, it was nothing like  the real thing!  <br/>\nLOL! <br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps. <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27314618,"authorName":"Genevieve","from":"&quot;Genevieve&quot; &lt;katgrl705@...&gt;","profile":"katgrl705","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Questions","postDate":"1143663906","msgId":11164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwZXFmMis5bmIxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4521,"nextInTopic":11183,"prevInTime":11163,"nextInTime":11165,"topicId":4499,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been lurking for a while and seriously considering unschooling.
