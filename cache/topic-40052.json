Also I was stating that I wondered if by having the C-section, no matter the reason for one, if that threw off the sleeping pattern of the child or what we would see as the birth &quot;time&quot; of the child as opposed to what it would have been without the C-section.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think the older we get, the longer we have trained ourselves to a different time frame than what we started out with, the &quot;easier&quot; it is to change our sleeping behavior.
