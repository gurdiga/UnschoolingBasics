A few have had updates already so you may have seen this twice.<br/>\n <br/>\nYesterday at 1:15 Jossilyn, age 9, past away. Jossilyn had been in the  <br/>\nhospital since January 31st. She had been fighting an infection and  fever among <br/>\nothers the last few weeks and months. This was her  second battle with AML, a <br/>\nrare form of Leukemia since first diagnosed  a couple years ago.   <br/>\nJossilyn has 5 other siblings who live  with their mom, Marge, here in Maine.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have not had the chance to speak with her mother yet.

(For those who wish <br/>\ndonate at Bank Of America you will need the  fund name and  &quot;Trustee, Laura Drew&quot; <br/>\nif they cannot locate it.) <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for all your well wishes for this little girl and the loving  words <br/>\nfor her family.
