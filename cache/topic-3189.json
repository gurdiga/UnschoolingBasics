It&#39;s &quot;Summerhill A Radical Approach to Child Rearing&quot;<br/>\nby A.S. Neill who&#39;s own history as a school misfit is fascinating and who<br/>\nfounded an alternative school in 1921 in England based on giving children<br/>\nFreedom - the book is all about his observations and beliefs in how to best<br/>\nhelp children grow up to be happy human beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was published in 1960 (I got it from the library) and I am blown away by<br/>\nwhere this man was at on so many issues like feeding babies on demand and<br/>\nco-sleeping at this time.  There is much fascinating and challenging in our<br/>\nviews of children in this book.  I&#39;m so glad I read it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for talking about it in your book, Valerie...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan (reading a lot lately)<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n&quot;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than<br/>\nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it.&quot;  ...
