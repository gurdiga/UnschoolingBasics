Poor hubby, he&#39;s a gem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey live out of state and whenever we talk to her *we* have to ask about the <br/>\nkids and dh or the whole conversation ends up all about her, what SHE&#39;S up <br/>\nto, her whining, her politics, her job, her views, her her her. (It makes ya <br/>\nready for the snore shelf &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe went to India for 3 weeks by herself  last summer (again, it was all just <br/>\nabout her) the dh stayed home and worked and her kids stayed with us for a <br/>\nweek and then other relatives the rest of the time. (it was the week from hell I <br/>\nmight add) We never even got a phone call saying &quot;Hi I had a great time in <br/>\nIndia, *thanks* for keeping the kids for so long. How did it go?&quot; Nothing. When <br/>\n*we* did finally call her, she never even mentioned the kids or our visit or <br/>\nanything, it was again, all about her. How boring. This is my dh sister, I <br/>\ncannot believe they come from the same family, my dh is completely opposite of her <br/>\nand LOVES unschooling. They both went to ps and she is a firm believer in the <br/>\nWaldorf beliefs.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly, I LOVED your responses about this &quot;waldorf friend&#39;s opinion&quot; on <br/>\nunschooling. It&#39;s easy to see that you are very knowledgeable about Waldorf in your <br/>\nresponse, too bad the Waldorf friend didn&#39;t do her homework about unschoolers <br/>\nbefore she shot her mouth off about us.

I don&#39;t know any adult unschoolers but the numerous teen unschoolers I have met are delightful to be around. They are compassionate, caring, helpful to each other and friendly to adults and smaller kids. They are passionate about their interests in a way I wish I could have been at their age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are many different reasons to help others. For some it is innate. (I&#39;m thinking Howard Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences.) My daughter Qacei has been raising money for charity since she was 8.  My son Conor will often buy treats for his buddies or offer to pay a friend&#39;s way somewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor others it&#39;s having a giving nature modeled for them. They&#39;ve both helped me gather food for foodbanks, items for the homeless shelter or toys for a Christmas Toys for Tots program.  <br/>\nNone of this makes them better than people who may not immediately do this, it&#39;s just part of who they are and how they&#39;ve lived. And in fact, it&#39;s a part that can sometimes hurt them as they feel things so deeply and care almost too much. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason to help comes from a sense of guilt, I think. Being told you&#39;re supposed to feel a certain way or &quot;give back&quot; a certain amount. I suppose that has its place. But I don&#39;t think any one philosophy or teaching method is going to instill a natural inclination to reach out to others though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She then went on to tell me of the antrposophical theorys through Waldorf that a child&#39;s ego doesn&#39;t develop till later and that all this self lead can create real narcissistic people.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah Waldorf claims a lot of things about Anthroposophy.
