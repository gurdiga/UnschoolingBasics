I <br/>\nfeel so much better knowing that I`m not alone.<br/>\nMy daughter is 12 and this is our second year of H/S.  I agree with the <br/>\n&quot;invisible&quot; bullying that girls do. I`m sort of glad that my kid didn`t want to be <br/>\none of the airhead girls who follow the popular girls around.But at the same <br/>\ntime I want her to have friends and feel good about herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I did the &quot;school at home&quot; route which got old really quick.I`m <br/>\nmore relaxed now but I still feel like I have to account to people about what <br/>\nshe`s learning. Right now I just want her to gain some self confidence that was <br/>\nlost.She`s such a great kid; she likes to make things out of paper etc and she <br/>\nreally amazes me with her imagination.So what if she never learns algebra.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work nights and when I drive home in the morning I see kids going to <br/>\nschool; I feel bad for them AND their parents because they`re missing so much time <br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me share................Lyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4903,"nextTopicId":4905}}
