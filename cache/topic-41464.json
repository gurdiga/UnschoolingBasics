And, then, my darling 11 year old daughter wanted to go back to school this fall.  My DS, 8, was content to stay home.  So, I had to move through my resistance and see what I could do to get her into school.  She tried our neighborhood middle school and HATED it...hated the caste system (they have a &quot;school within a school&quot; for the gifted kids.  All of her elementary school friends were in that gifted program.  But she missed the chance to apply last year because we had started homeschooling).  She hated the bells.  She hated the fact that she wasn&#39;t allowed to sit with her friends at lunch because they were in different homerooms.  She hated the stupid stuff they were trying to teach her.  Oh, and I am sooooooooo glad I shut up and supported her.  She had the opportunity to make her own assessment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, now, she is back home (took only one day).  She is not interested in private school (which we couldn&#39;t afford anyway).  And, she is letting go of the idea of getting into another public city school (waiting list too long) and now, it turns out, that two of her best buds from kindergarten are homeschooling too this year, not by first choice but because they are on a middle school waiting list too.  Perhaps that will change as they settle into the life!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, she is focused on her acting career, which is her biggest desire.  We&#39;ve got her enrolled in an acting class and we are going to go to NYC to check out a one-day acting conference.  And, she is going to audition for plays locally.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my little guy is ready to try some things other than TV and video games, although he is enjoying them still and dad is playing more with him every night, because he loves them too.  And, their relationship is growing tighter and stronger!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I am letting go more and more of my expectations of what they should be doing or not, in regards to food and sleep and what ever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, my hubby is on board and in a beautiful state of recovery (thanks Peaceful Partnerships for all of your postings this summer!!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I am finding health and healing in my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I am inspired by John Gotto&#39;s books.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I was wondering why the de-schooling phase was taking soooo long - way longer than a month per year in school.  And, then, I considered the possibility that we had more stuff to work through because of DS&#39;s medical issues - 5 open heart surgeries, 6 other heart procedures, 2 dental surgeries, and hospitalization for dehydration and anemia.  That&#39;s right, Dear Son had all of these and we all struggled through survival mode for 6 years!!  But, that&#39;s all over, and should it come up again, with our un-schooling family, we would navigate those waters differently, since we would all be in our family boat, rather than here or there at different schools apart during the day.  Anyway, I am acknowledging that we had more to recover from than 6 years of school!!  And, so we needed more time to de-school!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, here we are, sailing along, with the winds on our side, feeling great, headed to our first unschooling conference to check that out, settled and expanding our individual-centered-learning.  Feeling GOOD!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\n<br/>\nElli</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41334,"nextTopicId":41505}}
