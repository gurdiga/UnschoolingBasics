Too many <br/>\ndifferent things out at once (as in, available to him) and it&#39;s more <br/>\nthan he can take (this isn&#39;t me saying this as a controling parent - <br/>\nhe&#39;ll actually tell me it&#39;s all too much). However, he does have <br/>\nSensory Integration Disorder and can be easily overstimulated. <br/>\nSometimes he prefers to have only a few different types of toys <br/>\navailable at a given time (the rest we box up until he wants them out <br/>\nagain), sometimes he&#39;ll keep things in different rooms (legos in one <br/>\nroom, lincoln logs in another room, GI Joes in another). <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that my kid isn&#39;t the only one like this. My friends daughter <br/>\nis the same way. Her mom was cleaning right before Christmas and asked <br/>\nher daughter if maybe they could give away one or two of her stuffed <br/>\nanimals. She was sure her daughter would insist on keeping all of <br/>\nthem. Her daughter only wanted to keep 2 - they ended up getting rid <br/>\nof 12!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9429,"nextTopicId":9356}}
