I am really afraid that if she hurt <br/>\nherself accidentally, and needed t go to the hospital, that I might <br/>\nface Children&#39;s Services for being negligent (sleeping on the job).  <br/>\nI know of too many people who have had a house call from CS for <br/>\nridiculous reasons -- and have heard about others who are <br/>\nneglecting/abusing their children, and somehow have never had a <br/>\nvisit, or CS came and saw no problem.  I do not live in fear or hover <br/>\nover their daily activities, because I do feel comfortable with our <br/>\nhome environment as being child friendly.  I allow them to do their <br/>\nown thing in the house or yard without worry most of the time, but <br/>\ncannot relax enough to take a nap in another room.  I feel like I am <br/>\nreally stretching safety to occasionally take a shower and leave them <br/>\nalone.  Because you never know what can happen in life...accidents <br/>\nare accidents.
