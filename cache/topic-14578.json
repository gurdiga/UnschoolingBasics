I really need to have a  <br/>\nclean house, not only for my own thought processes, but because we  <br/>\nhave a baby and a toddler that it would be unsafe if there was a  <br/>\nbunch of little stuff on the floor. It&#39;s easier to find the little  <br/>\nstuff when the big stuff isn&#39;t there. So we wallow in the laundry  <br/>\ntogether as we fold it. Or they drive their trucks through it as I  <br/>\nfold it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can clean without having the kids sitting at the table. And they  <br/>\nhelp me clean a lot of the time. I don&#39;t stress out about it any, but  <br/>\nit is important to me. The kids know that and respect it. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nstop them from making a dozen messes, but if i said I was  <br/>\nuncomfortable and asked for ten second tidy, they&#39;d totally jump up  <br/>\nand do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nand I do mop every day. With nine people in our house, you literally  <br/>\nstick if you don&#39;t. Either way isn&#39;t good or bad, it&#39;s what works for  <br/>\nyour family.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 14, 2006, at 6:52 PM, freepsgal wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, is this attitude of mine an unschooling thing?

I&#39;ve been homeschooling 4+ years and I&#39;ve <br/>\nhad my phases of feeling like I need to be a clean freak and have <br/>\ndaily chores, ala Flylady.net.  I actually enjoyed my Flylady <br/>\nroutines for about 6 weeks and then got bored with them and went <br/>\nback to the way I was before my organizing/cleaning fad.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I see housework and/or chores mentioned in homeschool <br/>\ncircles all the time.  It&#39;s generally people wondering how they can <br/>\ndo it all... how can they teach their children and manage their <br/>\nhouseholds?  Even when I was pulling together schoolwork based on <br/>\nThe Well-Trained Mind, I still had time to do the necessary chores, <br/>\ni.e. dishes and laundry before they run out, and the occasional keep-<br/>\nit-at-bay duties such as dusting, vacuuming and bathroom stuff.  My <br/>\nkids and I just do whatever we feel is necessary to get done.  For <br/>\nexample, I did a load of laundry this morning because my son didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave any clean shorts.  But I haven&#39;t yet pulled the entire load out <br/>\nof the dryer.  There are many nights I don&#39;t cook because I really <br/>\nhate cooking so we grab something out and bring it in.  But I&#39;ve <br/>\nknown some people who get very uptight about keeping on their chore <br/>\nschedules, as if putting off dusting another day or two might make <br/>\nthe house spontaneously combust!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is this attitude of mine an unschooling thing?  The relaxed side <br/>\nof me that would rather wallow in the clothes on the floor with my <br/>\nkids than to have them sitting properly at the dining room table <br/>\ndoing schoolwork so I can sweep/mop the kitchen?  Gosh, dare I <br/>\nconfess that I&#39;ve lived in my house for one year and I&#39;ve only <br/>\nmopped once??  *LOL*  I clean up spills as I see them so my floor <br/>\nisn&#39;t yucky, but I did have a friend who felt the need to wet mop <br/>\nher floor after every meal.
