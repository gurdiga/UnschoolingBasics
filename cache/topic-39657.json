I have been inspired enough by my incredible unschooling sister-in-law to really look into it for my son who is 14months.  I am studying early childhood education at uni and have been completing one subject at a time since my son was born.  This semester was &quot;Research in Early Childhood&quot; and we were allowed to choose our own focus so purely for &quot;professional&quot; reasons of course (hehe) I chose unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is multitudes of research out there looking into homeschooling and informal or natural learning in terms of whether it &quot;works&quot; or not (and the evidence is overwhelmingly clear that homeschooling - particularly with an informal approach - is so much better for the child in many many ways) so I decided I wanted to look deeper and find out about parent&#39;s epistemological beliefs - beliefs about how children learn and know - and their impact on educational choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSO I am interested in peoples thoughts, feelings and opinions relating to how children learn and also views on knowing - what is it, how does it happen etc.  If you would be so kind as to share your ideas on the matter I would be so grateful!  (It might be helpful for you too!)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor clarification some springboard questions are:<br/>\n<br/>\nLEARNING<br/>\nHow do you think children learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did you choose unschooling specifically over traditional homeschoolong or schooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you think of an experience when you really noticed a child had learnt something?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you know when a child has learnt something?<br/>\n<br/>\nKNOWING<br/>\nMany people believe that there are “right” answers or “truth” when teaching children, what is your belief?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you agree with the idea that there are no right answers for teaching children and anyone’s opinion is as good as another’s?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would greatly appreciate your feedback as I feel so inspired by everything I am learning and discovering and would like to share that enthusiasm with educators.  This is not a professional research document, i.e. it WILL NOT be published, it is merely an undergrad uni research assignment and will be viewed only by the marker and participants if they request it.

Please let me know if you do not want me to include your response in my assignment and of course that would be fine and I completely understand!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKind regards, <br/>\n<br/>\nHannah.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
