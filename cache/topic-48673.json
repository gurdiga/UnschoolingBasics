It is as if she is just needing a good cry at times.  She usually does go on to sleep and then wakes up feeling fine later.  I&#39;ve started sitting with her in her room and she really likes that.  I&#39;ve started keeping her blinds about half shut and her TV turned down and she will often just retreat in there without a big scene, lay down, and go to sleep.  It&#39;s almost as if she&#39;s trying to get away from the noise and activity of the rest of the household.  I am considering giving her her own room, too.  Right now she shares with her 4 yo brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 2 yr old daughter has begun having meltdowns, at least once a day.

Some kids go through a stage of crying themselves to sleep - using crying as a kind of strategy to transition into sleep. My daughter did, and it is really upsetting for a parent, I know. But it really did seem to be that she was tired and that was what was working for her to get from &quot;play play play play play&quot; to somnolence. It was a relief to me to know that it&#39;s not all that uncommon. It&#39;s similar, in a way, to that feeling of &quot;needing a good cry&quot; if you know what I mean? Crying can be a way to break up a lot of tension and relax. It won&#39;t last forever and you don&#39;t need to &quot;teach her better&quot; she&#39;ll grow out of it. It took Mo about a year of crying to sleep nearly every night before she moved on. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: 2 yr old meltdown","postDate":"1340883147","msgId":48695,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpzaGZjYis3dTFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpzZ29jNitqN2JxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48693,"nextInTopic":48696,"prevInTime":48694,"nextInTime":48696,"topicId":48673,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds like she s exhausted.

Does she wake up happy from the nap? She may not be able to plan her days well enough to realize she needs a nap but you and the other kids might help. Five older brothers -- I&#39;m tired just thinking about it. How about they give her some space and let her ease into nap time? Are they old enough to talk to about this? Will they understand playing quietly for a bit after lunch so Little Sister can ease into a nap/rest without having to crash? Can you do something with her and without them for a quiet, restful time?<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;messy_boys@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Claire Darbaud cdarbaud@&gt; wrote:  What does her day look like prior to the meltdown?
