My natural sleep time is from 4:00 a.m. to noon, or even 6:00 a.m. to 2:00pm. My kids have it too. That was one of the many reasons we started homeschooling/unschooling when we did. The school schedule was wreaking havoc on all of us! Kids and adults who have DSPS also naturally need to eat on a later schedule. They&#39;re not going to feel like eating &quot;breakfast&quot; at 7 or 8 a.m. That&#39;s like trying to get a person with a &quot;normal&quot; sleep schedule to wake up and eat breakfast at 2 or 3 a.m.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven now, I work in the afternoons/evenings, and my daughter takes only afternoon college classes, and works an afternoon/evening shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s often very difficult to function in the world of 9 to 5, being such an incurable night-owl. But this sleep phase disorder is genetic, and, from my own experience and based on years of reading about others with DSPS, attempts to &quot;fix&quot; it by using various types of therapies, meds, or melatonin, seem to work only temporarily, at best. (About melatonin: Some articles I&#39;ve read say that it may not be safe for children to take melatonin, since it IS a hormone, and too much of it can interfere with the child&#39;s natural hormone regulation and growth. I take 1/2 of a 3 mg tablet *occasionally*; my daughter takes a whole 3 mg tablet *occasionally*. But she never took it until she was in her teens. And never every night.) <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a natural shift to a sleep schedule that is like DSPS that happens to many - perhaps even most - teens. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust addressing the issue of the 9 y.o., is it possible that she has either genetic/familial DSPS, or is experiencing the teen shift a few years early?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf trying to shift her sleep schedule back a few hours doesn&#39;t seem to work, or creates a lot of stress and unhappiness, is she safe staying up until 3 a.m. while the rest of you are asleep? Can she quietly read, watch TV, or play? Is it possible to arrange her day schedule so that she rarely needs to be up and out before noon?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the 3 y.o. - if she falls asleep at around midnight, will she then sleep at least 9 hours?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is somewhat easier to deal with delayed sleep cycles if the late sleepers can then get enough sleep. If the children fall asleep really late and wake up early anyway, that&#39;s a lot more difficult. Then they&#39;re constantly sleep-deprived.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the latter case, I would suggest that you speak to a pediatrician about whether there are any sleep aids that are safe for children, on a short-term or occasional basis.  Also, look up information about herbal/natural sleep aids, such as valerian.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":415930464,"authorName":"Amy Morgan","from":"Amy Morgan &lt;amymorgan1970@...&gt;","profile":"amymorgan1970","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Helping Post-Institutionalized Child with Sleep","postDate":"1356976026","msgId":49354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTY5NzYwMjYuODM3OTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MDQwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEEwODg1REE3LTUxNzItNEU1NC1CQ0RELTk2NTA1MDI4RkIwMUB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEEwODg1REE3LTUxNzItNEU1NC1CQ0RELTk2NTA1MDI4RkIwMUB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49353,"nextInTopic":49356,"prevInTime":49353,"nextInTime":49355,"topicId":49333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am new here, but I would like to jump in and tell you that we made sleep spray in one of our MOPS meetings.  We just put some essential oil in water. ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1014854170\">I am new here, but I would like to jump in and tell you that we made &quot;sleep spray&quot; in one of our MOPS meetings.  We just put some essential oil in water.  When my daughter was ready to go to bed, she would ask for the spray.  She is now eight and enjoys going to Bath and Body and the like and picks out her &quot;sleep spray&quot;.  Some people called it monster spray, but I didn&#39;t like that idea.  I think it tells her body that it is time for sleep.  She does it every night.  We also used a night time CD.  She loves classical music and lullabies.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAmy M.     Mrs.Rooster<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333388203,"authorName":"Rinelle","from":"&quot;Rinelle&quot; &lt;rinelle@...&gt;","profile":"rinelle2011","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Helping Post-Institutionalized Child with Sleep","postDate":"1356936178","msgId":49350,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMwMDU3NzRFOERFNzQwNzY4NkU2NTU4NDU4OTRBNDY0QFJpbmVsbGVQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTY5MTIyMzQuNDY3MjEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4NjEwMy5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGtibG1jbitpM3Y4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8a2JxaXU5K240OGFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxMzU2OTEyMjM0LjQ2NzIxLllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxODYxMDMubWFpbC5pcjIueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49349,"nextInTopic":49351,"prevInTime":49349,"nextInTime":49351,"topicId":49333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Moving to less sleep controls has been a long ongoing process for us, and I m pretty sure we still have a way to go!

She&#39;ll be quiet for a <br/>\nwhile, watch for an hour or two, then she&#39;s recharged, and ready to play <br/>\nagain!

Be more active, go swimming, go roller skating or bowling or more active day things and see if they fall asleep more easily in the evening? <br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle to go to sleep when I&#39;m really tired. I struggle with the transition from where I am to bed. Brushing my teeth, getting into pyjamas, all of that is such a hurdle that moving from where I am relaxed and comfortable is a big effort. And I don&#39;t fall asleep where I am very easily. If I were wise I might take care of all of those things while I had a bit more energy so that the steps to bed were fewer. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I struggle to fall asleep at any point in time. I have to wind down the narrative in my head. I have to read or play a game or do something until I am literally dropping with tiredness. When I was little, from toddling age, I would wander the house rather than sleep. I was caught once, at 2 years old, when we were camping crawling out of the window of the van where I was supposed to be sleeping. Fortunately my grandfather had to take a leak in the middle of the night and caught me before I made it out of the van. My parents never really figured out a way of dealing with it. Once I fell asleep I slept through the night. Same now. It&#39;s the transition from wake to sleep that I struggle to make. The worst possible response is for me to simply lie in bed and wait for sleep to come. I don&#39;t have the requisite ability to clear my mind and fall asleep. The tools I use now are books and a ds. It is wonderful to not lie in bed for hours with nothing to<br/>\n do. I used to watch the clock turn over minute after minute because I wasn&#39;t supposed to have my light on after a certain time and I would go to school having not slept for more than a couple of hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people sleep doesn&#39;t come easily. Help your children to be comfortable and find them things that they can do into the wee hours. It is awful to be sleepless. It isn&#39;t nearly so bad to be tired but engaged. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":4185092,"authorName":"cyberbreadbowl","from":"&quot;cyberbreadbowl&quot; &lt;jredwine@...&gt;","profile":"cyberbreadbowl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Helping Post-Institutionalized Child with Sleep","postDate":"1356910345","msgId":49348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGticWl1OStuNDhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtibG1jbitpM3Y4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49347,"nextInTopic":49349,"prevInTime":49347,"nextInTime":49349,"topicId":49333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

DD1<br/>\n&gt; spent her first 37 months and DD2 spent her first 20 months in an<br/>\n&gt; Eastern European orphanage. Sleep schedules were strictly regimented in<br/>\n&gt; the orphanage. I guess you could say this is their &#39;deschooling&#39; period<br/>\n&gt; from 24/7 institutional life. It took many months for our oldest to<br/>\n&gt; regulate food independently and that was a hard process to watch as a<br/>\n&gt; parent, but she&#39;s great with food now. We have tried so many ways to get<br/>\n&gt; there with sleep, but without as much success, so I am writing for<br/>\n&gt; advice please.<br/>\n&gt; We believe that our 4 year old DD unfortunately suffered some trauma<br/>\n&gt; from the night-watch nanny at the orphanage (probably physical abuse)<br/>\n&gt; and is now very fearful of sleep in general and resists sleeping day or<br/>\n&gt; night. Whether she makes her own sleep decisions or we as parents help<br/>\n&gt; her, she has an extremely difficult time. She is a person who needs A<br/>\n&gt; LOT of sleep and if she doesn&#39;t get it, her mood/behavior is profoundly<br/>\n&gt; affected and she feels totally miserable. She is a very kind and loving<br/>\n&gt; person when she is well rested, although she feels awful when she is<br/>\n&gt; over-tired (hitting, spitting, kicking, whining, demanding, crying<br/>\n&gt; continuously) yet she resists falling asleep. The mere mention of the<br/>\n&gt; word sends her sobbing. Unfortunately, this is starting to affect DD2<br/>\n&gt; and she is starting to have the same reactions.<br/>\n&gt; The longest we have tried having DD1 make her own sleep choices was one<br/>\n&gt; month and we just couldn&#39;t get past that point because she was not<br/>\n&gt; getting nearly enough rest; every single day she was tired and cranky<br/>\n&gt; and my husband and I were beside ourselves with frustration at the ill<br/>\n&gt; effects (of her not getting enough rest) on the entire family. When she<br/>\n&gt; was making her own sleep decisions, she was falling asleep about<br/>\n&gt; midnight and waking about 8 (about 3-4 hours shy of the amount of sleep<br/>\n&gt; she needs to feel like herself) and she went without a nap 100% of the<br/>\n&gt; time. Although many children don&#39;t need a nap at age 4, my DD has a<br/>\n&gt; difficult time getting through the day without one most days. (A couple<br/>\n&gt; of days a week she seems to feel fine without it).<br/>\n&gt; I love all the pictures here <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a>&gt; of adorable toddlers falling asleep<br/>\n&gt; just about anywhere. In my ideal world, that&#39;s what I imagine, but I<br/>\n&gt; obviously want to do what&#39;s best for my DD and her specific needs. Right<br/>\n&gt; now she is functioning so well and feeling the best that I have ever<br/>\n&gt; seen her (because she is getting enough sleep), but I&#39;m telling her when<br/>\n&gt; &quot;it&#39;s time&quot;. She gets hyperactive when she crosses the line to<br/>\n&gt; over-tired. so I have been trying to catch her just before that point<br/>\n&gt; and lay down with her for 30-60 minutes until she falls asleep. But she<br/>\n&gt; resists everything about &#39;bedtime&#39; and the worst part about the way we<br/>\n&gt; are doing it now is all the struggles when I mention that &quot;it&#39;s time&quot;<br/>\n&gt; which often results in me yelling (ugh, I hate that part). The best<br/>\n&gt; thing about the way we are doing it now is that she is finally getting<br/>\n&gt; enough sleep and therefore feeling great.<br/>\n&gt; I know about gradual change: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a>&gt; and I&#39;d like some practical<br/>\n&gt; advice on how to make this transition please. I think sleep is<br/>\n&gt; something she really needs to learn how to control and maybe that will<br/>\n&gt; help her to heal from the past. I want her to feel empowered so that her<br/>\n&gt; thoughts about sleep will change. I talk to her about how our bodies<br/>\n&gt; feel when they are tired and need rest.

It may be that you can make things easier on her by having a routine, but one which doesn&#39;t push her buttons. So if she&#39;s used to bath-story-bed (I have no idea, I&#39;m just making up an example) then you could try watching a movie instead - something that maybe was a treat before. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids, just like some adults, fall asleep better with an evening routine. It&#39;s not somehow bad or controlling to help someone you love settle down for the night, it&#39;s sweet and kind and thoughtful. The hard part, for you, is going to be finding ways to do that which don&#39;t push your kid&#39;s buttons - which may take some time to work out. It may also take some time, period. My daughter went through a stage where she cried herself to sleep every night - it was baffling to me, but I learned it wasn&#39;t an uncommon stage. Sometimes kids find tears a useful strategy to relax into sleep. Did you ever have the feeling that you &quot;need a good cry&quot;?

It&#39;s not uncommon for young children to have trouble with transitions - and sleep is a kind of transition, one which can be pretty scary. So you do what you can to ease the transition, but at the same time realize that transitions are hard. Both my kids went through stages where transitions were big, dramatic events. It helped me to relax into the drama, to accept that even if I did everything &quot;right&quot; there would likely still be a screaming, flailing young child. Accepting that, I could be the calm one - and that was Enormously helpful. I wasn&#39;t adding to the drama and stress, so things didn&#39;t spiral up quite so far. Transitions were more peaceful, even the ones involving meltdowns.<br/>\n<br/>\n And eventually, each of my kids outgrew that stage. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Helping Post-Institutionalized Child with Sleep","postDate":"1356089986","msgId":49334,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTYwODk5ODYuNTY5ODcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNS5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtiMTZ0NStvOWNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtiMTZ0NStvOWNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49333,"nextInTopic":49335,"prevInTime":49333,"nextInTime":49335,"topicId":49333,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Well because I could not sleep, and man am I tired, I can answer this right now :)  Two things that jump at me is: Why can t she sleep past 8 AM?

I Do say I am going to sleep when I am tired.  I do ask my daughter to go with me.

Do not announce it is time to sleep. Do not even go to bed! Maybe later it will be OK in 6 months of a year. But for now just make sure she can sleep peacefully and get enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso many kids do not want to go to sleep while parents stay awake.  Maybe she does not want to be alone at night. Maybe have her sleep in your room, even if in her own bed or a mattress on the floor. My kids slept with me at 4.  <br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe read books about sleeping that are sweet to her. Some kids gets lulled by their parents reading to them or a book on tape.<br/>\nFind ways to relax together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will be rested if they have some very relaxing  and easy going time during the day instead of a nap. Some snuggling to watch a movie or favorite show. Some books maybe. Not a nap but a relaxing time to charge up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind ways that are sweet for her to rest, sleep in in a dark room in the morning,fall asleep at night without you turning into a battle because &quot; it it time&quot;!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as someone who takes a long time to sleep  I just want to say that some people are like that. They just do not go to bed and fall asleep, even when tired. Some of us need to relax into it. I usually take from 30 minutes, on a very good day, to 2 hours for me to fall asleep when I go to bed.  My parents never really made us go to bed and we had no bedtimes growing up.

She is a person who needs A<br/>\nLOT of sleep and if she doesn&#39;t get it, her mood/behavior is profoundly<br/>\naffected and she feels totally miserable. She is a very kind and loving<br/>\nperson when she is well rested, although she feels awful when she is<br/>\nover-tired (hitting, spitting, kicking, whining, demanding, crying<br/>\ncontinuously) yet she resists falling asleep. The mere mention of the<br/>\nword sends her sobbing. Unfortunately, this is starting to affect DD2<br/>\nand she is starting to have the same reactions.<br/>\nThe longest we have tried having DD1 make her own sleep choices was one<br/>\nmonth and we just couldn&#39;t get past that point because she was not<br/>\ngetting nearly enough rest; every single day she was tired and cranky<br/>\nand my husband and I were beside ourselves with frustration at the ill<br/>\neffects (of her not getting enough rest) on the entire family.  When she<br/>\nwas making her own sleep decisions, she was falling asleep about<br/>\nmidnight and waking about 8 (about 3-4 hours shy of the amount of sleep<br/>\nshe needs to feel like herself) and she went without a nap 100% of the<br/>\ntime. Although many children don&#39;t need a nap at age 4, my DD has a<br/>\ndifficult time getting through the day without one most days. (A couple<br/>\nof days a week she seems to feel fine without it).<br/>\nI love all the pictures here  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/sleeping\">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a>&gt;  of adorable toddlers falling asleep<br/>\njust about anywhere. In my ideal world, that&#39;s what I imagine, but I<br/>\nobviously want to do what&#39;s best for my DD and her specific needs. Right<br/>\nnow she is functioning so well and feeling the best that I have ever<br/>\nseen her (because she is getting enough sleep), but I&#39;m telling her when<br/>\n&quot;it&#39;s time&quot;. She gets hyperactive when she crosses the line to<br/>\nover-tired. so I have been trying to catch her just before that point<br/>\nand lay down with her for 30-60 minutes until she falls asleep.  But she<br/>\nresists everything about &#39;bedtime&#39; and the worst part about the way we<br/>\nare doing it now is all the struggles when I mention that &quot;it&#39;s time&quot;<br/>\nwhich often results in me yelling (ugh, I hate that part). The best<br/>\nthing about the way we are doing it now is that she is finally getting<br/>\nenough sleep and therefore feeling great.<br/>\nI know about gradual change: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange\">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a>&gt;  and I&#39;d like some practical<br/>\nadvice on how to make this transition please.  I think sleep is<br/>\nsomething she really needs to learn how to control and maybe that will<br/>\nhelp her to heal from the past. I want her to feel empowered so that her<br/>\nthoughts about sleep will change.  I talk to her about how our bodies<br/>\nfeel when they are tired and need rest.  Your suggestions are highly<br/>\nappreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49345,"nextTopicId":49357}}
