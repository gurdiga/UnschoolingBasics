The private server may have their own ToS which you must adhere<br/>\nto. To connect to a private server, you simply modify a text file in your<br/>\nWorld Of Warcraft install directory to point to a different login and realm<br/>\nserver. Most people would say that it IS a violation of the ToS for the<br/>\n&quot;client&quot; software to connect to a non-Blizzard server.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne *very important * thing to keep in mind is that many private servers are<br/>\nnot compatible with the latest patch versions of WoW from Blizzard. I highly<br/>\nrecommend making a copy of your WoW directory to a different place on your<br/>\ndisk and using one for private servers and one for Blizzard servers. That<br/>\nway, they never update each other and you can keep your compatibility with<br/>\nboth. This is especially true if you use a lot of the popular &#39;mods&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, setting up your own private server is not difficult if you are a<br/>\nlittle computer savvy. There are at least 2 major distributions for the<br/>\nserver/database and you just use install the maps which are already in your<br/>\nWoW directory. Of course you need to find people to play with you on your<br/>\nprivate server or it&#39;s not very fun. It can fun to design your own gear or<br/>\ngive yourself unlimited powers though..<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sun, Oct 26, 2008 at 8:12 PM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maryking1212@...\">maryking1212@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Kal has been invited to play on a private server run by Wowfusion.
