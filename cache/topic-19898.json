Do they want more or are they content for the moment?<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked my stepson this the other day - he seemed bored, so I asked <br/>\nif he wanted me to look for more fun stuff to do. His answer was <br/>\npretty equivocal (sp?) - he *does* feel like he&#39;s spinning his <br/>\nwheels a little, but he&#39;s also relieved that he doesn&#39;t *have* to do <br/>\n*anything*. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re weeks into deschooling, rather than months, so that makes a <br/>\nlot of sense to me. Right now he&#39;s still not sure this whole <br/>\nunschooling thing is real. Last night he found an old homework paper <br/>\nin his room and screamed: &quot;aaaaaaah! its homework!&quot; <br/>\n&quot;No, Ray, that&#39;s just a piece of trash&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Oh, yeah. Can we Burn it?&quot; <br/>\n&quot;Sure&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to get back on topic, if they seem bored, talk to them about <br/>\nthat, specifically. Do they want to do other things but need your <br/>\nhelp? Not &quot;schooly things&quot; fun things.

I think most unschooling <br/>\nparents feel what you&#39;re feeling in the beginning. This is a great <br/>\nplace to see that you&#39;re not alone. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds to me like you need to deschool yourself. Early on in our <br/>\nunschooling journey (it&#39;s been two years now), I remember the <br/>\nlightbulb going off in my head and I realised the change had to <br/>\nstart with ME. That was an eye opening revelation for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things you can do is find a hobby (phptography, knitting)<br/>\nor something you&#39;ve always wanted to try (rollerblading, baking) and <br/>\ngo for it! It will take some of the focus off being concerned about <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re kids are learning, you&#39;ll be modeling how much fun <br/>\nlearing something new is and I bet your enthuasium will rub off on <br/>\nthem. Invite them to join you in your new interest. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s some thoughts on deschooling for parents that I have on my <br/>\nblog that may be helpful to you.
