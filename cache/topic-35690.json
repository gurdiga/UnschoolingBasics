This is <br/>\nthe wrong place to ask for help with directions, subjects or lessons <br/>\nplan or college advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t want you to completely give up yet. I&#39;m thinking on the <br/>\nbasis that there must have been something about unschooling that <br/>\ndrawn you to it in the first place. What was it? What makes you <br/>\nthink unschooling will be good for you and your kid? Pam is right, <br/>\nyou need to read more becuase your understanding of the basis of <br/>\nunschooling is not there. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unschool will means no expectation of college, no transcript, no <br/>\nbiology or any other &quot;expected&quot; academic criteria, unless it is <br/>\nsomething the child wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo unschool your child would mean no forcing, no co-ercion and no <br/>\nexpectation. And yes, your writings is coming across to me as co-<br/>\nercion and in-directly &quot;imposing your beliefs&quot; onto your son. I know <br/>\nyou&#39;re only thinking of the best for him. You do know what is his <br/>\ninterest. You know what he wants to do and you&#39;re willing to <br/>\nfaciliate it, which is good. If you want to unschool him, then you <br/>\nhave to let him get on with his interest. Playing RPG games might <br/>\njust play a big part of his future. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn unschooling, the child live his/ her life the way they feel is <br/>\nbest. And we unschooling parents respect that, and support that. We  <br/>\nfacilitate and nurture that child&#39;s interest for however long it <br/>\ngoes. Sometimes it leads to something great but there are times the <br/>\nchild has put in so much effort and time into such interest, only to <br/>\ndump it because it&#39;s not what he wants now. I accept this, for my <br/>\nchild will know what he&#39;s doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe true success of unschooling (to me) will be when we parents is <br/>\nable to live with this child-led environment confidently with no <br/>\npain or worries or hang-ups.    <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust is a big thing. In unschooling, I learn to trust my son&#39;s <br/>\ninterest and instinct will lead him to a happy life, WITH OR WITHOUT <br/>\ncollege or uni.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard, learning to unschool for we have to un-learn alot of our <br/>\nconventional thinking. Some of us had it easy, some of us had it <br/>\nhard but with determination and understanding, and an open mind, we <br/>\nhave all managed to unschooled somehow. This is how I see it, plain <br/>\nand simple. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re uncomfortable with unschooling, then don&#39;t force yourself. <br/>\nThe Classical Education (Well Trained Mind) is worth checking out. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re willing to give unschooling a go, then continue <br/>\nreading, join a few more list. I&#39;ve been unschooling for 20 months <br/>\nand it&#39;s been lots of reading of blogs, Sandra Dodd&#39;s webpage, 4 <br/>\nunschooling list and books.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe cannot help you identify which show will cover which subject, <br/>\nsimply because that&#39;s not how it works in unschooling. We do not see <br/>\nthings in separate individual compartment. Everytime we watch a show <br/>\nor do a science experiment, it&#39;s intention is not to learn some <br/>\nmaths or english or science. It&#39;s intention was to satisfy our <br/>\ncuriosity of the why&#39;s and the how&#39;s. Any knowledge of maths or <br/>\ngeography or science that&#39;s attained, is in-evitable a by -product <br/>\nof such explorations. Hence, the child&#39;s knowledge can never be in <br/>\nthe orderly sequence as per the school curriculum. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe above is solely my opinion and I hope it&#39;ll help you make your <br/>\ndecision better. All the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Wishes,<br/>\nSharonBugs.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: diamndlady2001 &lt;diamndlady@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have concluded that complete unschooling isn&#39;t quite working for <br/>\nmy<br/>\n&gt; son<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then stop unschooling and go ask a homeschool list what to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is not a list for those interested in school-at-home. <br/>\nSeriously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ....he plays rpg games and watches education shows.

There are a lot of clues in your posts that suggest you don&#39;t really understand unschooling.  If you don&#39;t understand it, you can&#39;t really have experience with &quot;complete unschooling.&quot;    So, you&#39;ve come to a conclusion based on limited experience and some vague fears that you can&#39;t quite articulate.   Relax.  Read more about unschooling. <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n***...so, I want to use what he already does into a more &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>\nlooking transcript/curriculum.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is contributing to the confusion.    There is a difference between a transcript and a curriculum.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am trying to figure out how to make sure my DS (16) has<br/>\na well rounded transcript.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA transcript is a record of what a person has studied. Your son will probably not need a transcript.   If he does you can write one.   The transcript you write will be a record of what he took an interest in, not what he &quot;studied&quot;.    Since he will probably not need a transcript you can relax and put it out of your mind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Any thoughts on how to cover/encourage<br/>\nall the subjects would be appreciated.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, what are all the subjects?  All the subjects in the world?   List those for us, would you? &lt;g&gt;   All the subjects in your head?  All the subjects in school?   No one ever covers all the subjects.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll live long enough to cover all the subjects.&lt;g&gt;    Schools pick a few subjects and do a bad job of delivering information about them.  And they do a lot of harm.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person wakes up in the morning and gets out of bed there&#39;s a pretty good chance that during the course of the day that person will encounter all the things schools are calling &quot;subjects.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person wakes up and gets out of bed three hundred sixty five days a year they&#39;re ahead of the school which requires a kid look in several books a few hours a day for a hundred eighty days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThink about that.  The official learning of a kid in school would look like a few pages from five or six (poorly written)  books each day and some yackity yack from a teacher who&#39;d probably rather be home working in his garage.    Kids who have the opportunity and who have the attention of their parents will naturally and easily find more interesting and worthwhile things to do with their time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s nothing magic in those books.  Nothing that will make your kid smarter or better prepared or more interesting to college admissions people. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n***Presently, he wants to be a crab fisherman in alaska...like deadliest<br/>\ncatch.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could send away to Alaska for brochures and info, you know, the stuff they send to tourists and he could browse that.   There are some websites for Alaska fishing jobs, if he hasn&#39;t looked at those he might like them.

That&#39;s a &#39;typical&#39; school order to things but why <br/>\nthat order? For that matter, I know of places where geometry goes <br/>\nbefore algebra and some places that split algebra into two sections <br/>\nwith geometry in between. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reality is that algebra and geometry and &quot;consumer math&quot; (ack, <br/>\nhate that term) are all inter-related...everything is connected to <br/>\neverything else. They aren&#39;t walled off into separate &quot;subjects&quot;. For <br/>\ninstance, if you want to build a simple wooden box you need geometry <br/>\nto figure out the area of each side so you can get the proper amount <br/>\nof wood. You need &quot;consumer math&quot; to calculate price per sq foot and <br/>\ncheck for discounts (5% discount if you buy x amount of sq ft). And <br/>\nyou need algebra to calculate misc bits and pieces of the <br/>\nproject...algebra is finding an unknown based on known information. <br/>\nYou need 4 nails per side on the 4 inch sq sides and 3 per side on <br/>\nthe 3 inch sq sides. You&#39;ve got 3 sides and the bottom that are 4 <br/>\ninches and one side that is 3 inches and no top so how many nails do <br/>\nyou need? That&#39;s algebra. Then you need MORE &quot;consumer math&quot; to <br/>\nfigure out the cost of the nails. It&#39;s all bundled together...and <br/>\ninterwoven into it are things like art, design, &quot;shop&quot; skills like <br/>\nhammering a nail and using a saw, and how to choose the wood for the <br/>\nproject, plus whatever the project is &#39;for&#39; - is it a gift for a <br/>\nfamily traditional holiday or event? that&#39;d be culture and possibly <br/>\nhistory and such. is it an animal shelter of some sort? what animal? <br/>\nis it the right sort of shelter? Now you&#39;re getting into animal <br/>\nhusbandry, anatomy, biology. Is it to store snacks? what kind of <br/>\nsnacks? does it actually need a hinged top to keep out small <br/>\ncreatures? more animal issues, possibly more calculations, as well as <br/>\nnutrition concepts with the snacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might do well to just discuss with your son what HIS goals are <br/>\nand how you can assist him in reaching those goals (he may request <br/>\naccess to formal situations, he may not...he might just want you to <br/>\ncheck on how he can get to visit a local university&#39;s physics <br/>\ndepartment to talk with someone or possibly a membership to a serious <br/>\nlevel science museum or maybe just take him someplace he can throw <br/>\nstuff around and see what happens without denting the living room). <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW most newer RPGs have built in seriously intensive physics <br/>\nprocessing algorithms so that when you throw something or hit <br/>\nsomething, it reacts &quot;naturally&quot; as if you actually threw or hit the <br/>\nobject in real life.

Colleges are more and more  <br/>\nlooking at nontraditional students...adults who went straight into  <br/>\nthe workforce after school, military, and homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like if kids WANT something, they will do it in their time. If  <br/>\nhe wants college, he can do the SAT prep and go. If he wants to be a  <br/>\ncrab fisherman, awesome. Why fill his life with things that have no  <br/>\nmeaning for fear of the future? Can you imagine a transcript that  <br/>\nsays he learned quantum physics off the coast of the Aleutian  <br/>\nIslands? He&#39;ll know more about history, government, math, logic than  <br/>\nmost of incoming freshmen. The election is modern history...have you  <br/>\nbrought up how this election is similar to previous ones because of  <br/>\na, b or c?
