My name is Shannon and I am the proud mom of two dd&#39;s, 12 & 7 (almost 8).  I wouldn&#39;t say that I am an unschooler; very eclectic in my approach and try to work with the girls where they are with whatever means seems to work at the time.  I joined this group because I am always trying to learn more to be a better mom/teacher/student and love haveing the interactions and support from other hser&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the DVR, we are a 5 Tivo family and I don&#39;t know how we would cope without them.  There is so much on TV that is educational from PBS, Discovery, History Channel, A&E, Animal Planet, TLC, HGTV . . . I could go on and on cuz I can find a lesson in almost everything!  We even have one that you can burn recorded programs on disc.  I just learned about the Comcast DVR&#39;s too and that they aren&#39;t that much more expensive and you can get more channels when you upgrade than we get currenlty.  If any of my Tivo&#39;s die, that will be the replacement.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nShannon Sea <br/>\nMurfreesboro.
