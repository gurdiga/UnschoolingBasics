Rachael, our 13yo loves the<br/>\noutdoors.  She used to play soccer several years ago and just recently<br/>\nmentioned she would like to check into a local soccer group.  We have LOTS<br/>\nof animals and Rachael spends most of her days tending to/playing with them.<br/>\nWe have 4 horses.  Rachael purchased the 4th one with her own money with the<br/>\nintention of training and reselling her.  She is doing a really good job<br/>\nwith it so far.  We also have 2 ducks, a goat, 2 dogs, a cat, 2 hermit crabs<br/>\nand a recently adopted baby turtle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey both just finished a 5-week program at the gym where my dad is a<br/>\nmember.  They call it Girl Power.  They rock climb, yoga, race, step<br/>\naerobic, swim, and lots of other stuff.  Neither one wanted to sign up for<br/>\nthe next 5 weeks.  Long story<br/>\n<br/>\nMadison our 10yo would rather stay inside and not go anywhere.  Recently she<br/>\nhas started riding her bike more, and playing outside with Rachael more.<br/>\nShe does love to play with her dog but would be happier if her daddy and I<br/>\nwould allow her to bring the dog inside to play.  Madison has never been one<br/>\nfor sports.  We recently bought her a sewing machine.  She loves to sew and<br/>\ndesign the latest fashion in clothing.  Rachael our 13 yo is also an<br/>\nincredible artist.  The two of them have worked together on their designs.<br/>\nRachael paints on the jeans and Madison is going to add beading.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never done the 4-H thing.  We do go skating on occasion with some<br/>\nfriends of theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family has been through some pretty tough transitions in the last 2<br/>\nyears.  I think all of us have just enjoyed hibernating for a while.  We are<br/>\nslowly coming back out.  As I write this, the girls are piled in our bed<br/>\nwith my dh watching Shark Attack.  We just recently join Netflix.  I think<br/>\nwe are really going to enjoy that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have noticed lately on the posts that several families stay pretty active<br/>\nwith activities.  We tend to stay active around home.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey I.-in S.C.
