Which also included the car alarm clicker.<br/>\nOoops!!  I hadn&#39;t brought mine so we headed to the car.  Opened it and<br/>\npopped the hood to disconnect the alarm from the horn.  We still couldn&#39;t go<br/>\nanywhere because the alarm was still activated, just not sounding.  Dan took<br/>\nthe clicker apart and we had a really wonderful discussion about why the<br/>\nwater effected the clicker and what we would need to do to get it to work<br/>\nagain.  It took about half an hour to dry it out enough so that it would<br/>\nwork again.  When we got back in the car Keon said, &quot;Dad, you sure know a<br/>\nlot about a lot.  What school did you go to to learn all those things?&quot;  Dan<br/>\njust smiled and said, &quot;I didn&#39;t go to school.  I just learned them because I<br/>\nwanted to.&quot;  Keon sighed and said, &quot;I want to learn about a lot too.  Guess<br/>\nI won&#39;t go to school either.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved this weekend.  It was just so much fun and we got to pick some of<br/>\nour first fruits out of our garden.  We watched a lot of movies and enjoyed<br/>\njust hanging out with each other.  No schedules, no appointments, no &quot;have<br/>\nto&#39;s.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14082,"nextTopicId":14138}}
