Is that what it <br/>\nis...are they considering homeschooling and want your opinion? <br/>\nIf not, my advice is to say as little as possible around those who <br/>\nare questioning you. <br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there and don&#39;t worry about other people. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251127866,"authorName":"joalja2003","from":"&quot;joalja2003&quot; &lt;nolans6@...&gt;","profile":"joalja2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"How do you handle family that questions unschooling?","postDate":"1135877835","msgId":8619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwMTZzYitycGs3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8620,"prevInTime":8618,"nextInTime":8620,"topicId":8619,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone.
