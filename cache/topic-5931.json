In<br/>\nfact, my children have now become the &#39;bad influences.&quot;***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very normal for people to swing to extremes when a thing has been<br/>\ncontrolled and then the controls are lifted. <br/>\nIt levels out with time and kindly, balanced input from interested<br/>\nparents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***However, very soon after this, he started acting like Calvin! ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans learn by trying on what they see in the world around them.  We<br/>\nknow children learn from their parents and it&#39;s only natural for them to<br/>\nlearn from others.   A child trying on new and different behaviors is<br/>\nengaging in a kind of scientific exploration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fun, to be sure, to try out new personalities and behaviors but it&#39;s<br/>\nalso a means by which humans gather information.  It is very normal and<br/>\nany parent who thinks they want to or can stop it from happening will be<br/>\nvery surprised.   It happens with adults all the time and our children<br/>\nsee it.  When Sue mows her law we think, &quot;man I better get out there and<br/>\nmow mine.&quot;   When a friend calls us over to see her new scrap booking<br/>\nstuff we go buy some and make plans for a scrapbook for grandma for<br/>\nChristmas.   Don&#39;t be fooled into thinking it&#39;s a kid thing.  Women<br/>\nchange their hairstyles after seeing a nice one on some celebrity head.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes what a kid learns from trying on a new behavior is that it will<br/>\nreally piss mom off. There might be a world of reasons a kid would want<br/>\nto piss his mom off and those begin with the mom.  It might be that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to make mom mad,  sees the behavior then more clearly and<br/>\nstops it.  Sometimes he learns he loves football.  Sometimes he learns<br/>\npeople will find him more interesting if he tells jokes.  Sometimes he<br/>\nlearns it can hurt other&#39;s feelings.  It&#39;s all learning and it&#39;s all<br/>\nvaluable and very, very normal. <br/>\n<br/>\n***He was disgruntled about helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow why I have to help<br/>\nthat fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it was your real kid an not Calvin.  Maybe she wasn&#39;t as nice as<br/>\nshe could have been.  Maybe he feels like he has no real ability to<br/>\nexpress himself honestly.  Maybe he was busy with something more<br/>\nimportant and she showed no consideration for that.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;helping&quot; at all but an order for a little person to do something a big<br/>\nperson insisted upon.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it was so bad.  I think paying attention to a kids feelings<br/>\nis much more important than worrying about what our friends will think of<br/>\nus as parents.   I would be more interested in what made him feel that<br/>\nway than in automatically classifying that as &quot;bad behavior&quot;.    And<br/>\nsomething some parents never consider, kids respond to bad behavior with<br/>\nbad behavior.  Chances are the reason he was feeling and acting that way<br/>\nand even said it is because he was responding in kind.  The real<br/>\ndifference here is adults are seldom called on bad or rude behavior if<br/>\ntheir target is a kid.  It is not even considered rude or bad behavior<br/>\nwhen adults talk to kids the way they might talk to a dog.  That&#39;s just<br/>\nhow it is.  Lots of people never see it.  But kids always do. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I want to take the book away, but I feel so unschooly about that.<br/>\nI&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the things he finds<br/>\nenjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in his own way.  And<br/>\ndon&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials they<br/>\nare now watching!   ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t make his life better by making his world smaller.  It will<br/>\nnever work that way.<br/>\nBut you, as the person he spends the most time with will have the biggest<br/>\ninfluence on him.  You are more real than books and TV and you&#39;re voice<br/>\nwill be the loudest voice in his head.  Forever.  Make it the voice of<br/>\nfairness and reason and love.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids are not alone in the world of books and TV.  You&#39;re influence<br/>\nis still important.  Talk about what they&#39;re reading and why it&#39;s funny,<br/>\nwhy it&#39;s good, why they like it.  Does he like Calvin because he relates<br/>\nto a child who&#39;s life is so controlled by adults he&#39;s only really free<br/>\nand happy in his imagination? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have only the two options, &quot;control&quot; or &quot;free for all&quot;.   Be<br/>\ninvolved with what your kids are reading and watching and talk with them<br/>\nabout it.  Acknowledge that it&#39;s funny and why and talk about why some of<br/>\nit isn&#39;t really good in our real lives.   Acknowledge that sometimes the<br/>\nreason it&#39;s funny is because it&#39;s what we all wish we could do, but we<br/>\ndon&#39;t do it.  Talk about why there are good reasons to not always act on<br/>\nour secret desires.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***And don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials<br/>\nthey<br/>\nare now watching!  ***<br/>\n<br/>\nCommercials have been very positive here.  The psychology of advertising<br/>\nis a much discussed and beloved subject in our house.   Do some<br/>\nexperimenting.  Buy some things that are made to sound life changing and<br/>\nsee if you like them.  See if they all live up to the claims.  Ask you<br/>\nkids if fruit roll-ups taste better out of the dinosaur box or the Nemo<br/>\nbox. &lt;g&gt;  Talk about why an advertiser would put a famous guy on a cereal<br/>\nbox.  Who do they hope will by that cereal?  You&#39;ll have a great time.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I was hoping that our influence would be the dominate one, but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your influence is stifling.  Kids are under no obligation to be<br/>\nperfect.  They are under no obligation to be clones of their parents or<br/>\nof the seemingly perfect kids of our friends.   They need to be<br/>\nthemselves and they need acceptance and love.  You influence *is* bigger<br/>\nthan any other but make sure it&#39;s the influence you think it is.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re demonstrating a lack of regard for his feelings by criticizing his<br/>\nchoices in TV he may demonstrate that lack of consideration back at you<br/>\nor a sibling.   It&#39;s possible to talk about the behaviors of TV<br/>\ncharacters without making a judgement about the program or the person who<br/>\nlikes the program.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*** it is tempting to just pull the plug on the TV.***<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you can do this.  You have the power and the authority. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of their lives will be lived away from your power and authority.<br/>\n They&#39;ll spend sixteen or eighteen years with you and they&#39;ll spend sixty<br/>\nyears without you.  In those sixteen or eighteen years, if you cannot<br/>\nthink of a better way to help them learn than through externally enforced<br/>\nlimits and controls, who will do their thinking for them when they&#39;re on<br/>\ntheir own?   Will it be a controlling spouse?  A controlling boss? <br/>\nBusiness partner?  Drug dealer? <br/>\n<br/>\nWith your positive input and real interested participation and guidance<br/>\nthey can learn about good decision making and good behavior.  With your<br/>\nultimate control they will learn to not trust their own judgement.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou will not be able to control outside influences on your kids.  What<br/>\nyou are in control of is the kind of relationship you have with your<br/>\nkids.  If your relationship is loving and respectful and strong your kids<br/>\nwill value your opinions, trust your judgements, look to you for advice<br/>\nand hold you up as the standard instead of Calvin.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I think I could handle this all better if I was the only one<br/>\nexperiencing this rude behavior, but it&#39;s really a challenge to see them<br/>\nacting it out with other adults and kids. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t waste one minute worrying about what other people think of your<br/>\nkids, or think of you as a parent.  This relationship is not about<br/>\nwhether you&#39;re living up to someone elses standard of parenting.  Instead<br/>\nspend that time improving your relationship and communication with your<br/>\nkids.  Worry about what your kids think of *you.*  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t owe your friends good kids.   You owe your kids a big, happy<br/>\nlife with a mom who&#39;s right there helping along the way.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Cartoons and computer games","postDate":"1123691756","msgId":5972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRkZGFkYytuNmptQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwODEwLjA5MzQxNy4yNzE2LjIuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5971,"nextInTopic":5973,"prevInTime":5971,"nextInTime":5973,"topicId":5931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s up to you to<br/>\n&gt; offer your kids a big life.  If you don&#39;t do it, it would be very smart<br/>\n&gt; of them, really brilliant of them to find something stimulating and<br/>\n&gt; challenging like TV and games.  But if kids are watching because they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; bored then the parents need to think of ways to make life more<br/>\n&gt; interesting.  TV should be a choice among many choices, not the only<br/>\n&gt; choice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If a child has a lot of choices and chooses video games or TV then he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; getting something valuable from them.  People have all kinds of interests<br/>\n&gt; during their lives.  An intense interest in TV or video games now<br/>\n&gt; probably won&#39;t last a lifetime but for some people it might and those<br/>\n&gt; people could someday be sound technicians or cameramen.

They enjoy<br/>\ndoing many other things, like your kids, like drawing, playing house,<br/>\netc etc etc. Still, there are influences all ard them, and no program<br/>\nis truly &quot;wholesome&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, given that my girls have not had &#39;true&quot; freedom with TV and games,<br/>\nyou may take what i have to say with a big grain of salt. But I do<br/>\nhave some thots after reading your post...<br/>\n<br/>\n I think your children may just be trying to act like what they see on<br/>\nTV because they think it is &quot;fun&quot; or different. You cld have a<br/>\ndiscussion with them abt the behaviours you are uncomfortable with,<br/>\nand ask how they wld feel if people are really talking like this all<br/>\nthe time. experiment for half a day (or as long as everyone wants it)!<br/>\nYou will tell you ds &quot;Come for breakfast, you stinky and skinny little<br/>\nmonkey with protruding ears!&quot; and so on and so forth, ask if they like<br/>\nwhen people commuicate like this with them all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, my experience is sometimes they just need to be able to<br/>\nexperience for themselves being &quot;someone else&quot;. For quite a while dd1<br/>\ninsisted she was a character on this video series she watched, and<br/>\ninsisted we call her that character name, and told everyone (jncluding<br/>\nstrangers, airport security, etc) that she was X instead of Valerie.<br/>\nShe gets upset when we call her &quot;Valerie&quot; and said, &quot;I am X!!!!!&quot;....<br/>\nthings like that. We started to play along and after some time, X<br/>\nbecame a memory of the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs has been suggested watching TV with your children is also a good<br/>\nway to open a discussion abt some of *your* values. Discuss, talk abt<br/>\nit, but don&#39;t make a judgement such that they want to rebel against<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cld also try a playful approach to it, like I remember an example<br/>\nin the book &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; whereby the author had an encounter<br/>\nwith a boy who called him a &quot;name&quot; when he was abt to leave. The<br/>\nauthor did not get angry but engaged in a game where he came up with<br/>\nan even more awful name and begged the boy not to tell anyone he had a<br/>\ntruly horrible name. this takes the &quot;attention&quot; off that original<br/>\nname, and when the matter was make light of, and it was demonstrated<br/>\nthat it was not a good way to anger or challenge, it was dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is maybe they need an outlet from the negative emotions<br/>\nthey are getting from the programs. For instance, if I watch a sappy<br/>\nmovie, I cry during it, and after that i want to cry some more! I may<br/>\nsomehow get into a mode where I want to go read some sappy book and<br/>\ncry some more.... I&#39;m not sure if you get what I mean, but it is like<br/>\nthe emotions gets transferred to me and then i need to expel it. Kind<br/>\nof weird, huh? Maybe your boys also get some aggression from the<br/>\ncharacters in the programs and need an outlet to expel it. Maybe you<br/>\ncld suggest a physical activity/outlet after a TV session. there was<br/>\nalso a time when i was angry a lot and one day i dec&#39;d to watch my<br/>\nface as I uttered some angry faces and really recoiled at what I<br/>\nsaw.... you cld try that as a fun experience for your boys.... maybe<br/>\nlet them pretend they are like the charavters in the movie, videotape<br/>\nthem at it, then show them, just to give them an idea what they look<br/>\nlike when they behave that way, it may not be as &quot;cool&quot; as they thot<br/>\nthey may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how helpful this has been, just some of my thots.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\njanis<br/>\n<br/>\ndd1 Valerie (4yo)<br/>\ndd2 Sophia (almost 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/8/05, Sunday Cote &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sundaycote@...\">sundaycote@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading the thread on cartoons and computer games with<br/>\n&gt; interest.  Before I began unschooling last October I was very strict<br/>\n&gt; about TV viewing and we didn&#39;t even own any video games.  My boys were<br/>\n&gt; respectful and loving at that time, both to each other, their friends<br/>\n&gt; and the adults in their lives.  I&#39;ve noticed that since they started<br/>\n&gt; watching commercial TV (almost exclusively Nickelodeon), they have<br/>\n&gt; become more rude to each other.  There&#39;s such an adversarial<br/>\n&gt; relationship between them now.   I hear things come out of their mouths<br/>\n&gt; that are straight from their shows.  They are also more disrespectful of<br/>\n&gt; adults and girls (I have two boys).  Again, I see this modeled after all<br/>\n&gt; the cartoons they watch.  One of my ds3&#39;s favorite phrases now is, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to kick your butt.&quot;   Since my husband and I don&#39;t use this type<br/>\n&gt; of language, I know he gets it from TV.  Most of our friends are still<br/>\n&gt; very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t hear it from their kids.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad influences.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When ds7 was about 5 he discovered a Calvin and Hobbs book of cartoons<br/>\n&gt; that we had.  At first I thought this was great because he is an artist<br/>\n&gt; and it was spurring him on to create his own cartoons and read.<br/>\n&gt; However, very soon after this, he started acting like Calvin!  We had<br/>\n&gt; several talks about it but I finally just took the book away thinking he<br/>\n&gt; was too young for it.  Well, recently he asked about the book again.<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to be a good unschooler, I decided to give it back to him<br/>\n&gt; because this was where his interests were.  We had a talk about how<br/>\n&gt; Calvin wasn&#39;t a real person and that in real life, at least in ours, we<br/>\n&gt; try to work out our challenges in a more respectful way.  I explained<br/>\n&gt; about how the point of the book was to be funny, which it was, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; still not appropriate in real life.  He said he completely understood<br/>\n&gt; and agreed to not use the phrases and behaviors that Calvin uses.<br/>\n&gt; Well, only a few days later he was at my friends house, and she told me<br/>\n&gt; about an incident where she had asked him to help her find his shoes so<br/>\n&gt; they could leave and when she left the room, he was muttering under his<br/>\n&gt; breath, but loud enough for her to hear.  He was disgruntled about<br/>\n&gt; helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I have to help<br/>\n&gt; that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He hasn&#39;t asked for the book since them, so I haven&#39;t addressed it with<br/>\n&gt; him.  I want to take the book away, but I feel so unschooly about that.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the things he finds<br/>\n&gt; enjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in his own way.  And<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all the commercials they<br/>\n&gt; are now watching!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When we weren&#39;t watching the shows he wants to watch, I didn&#39;t see this<br/>\n&gt; type of behavior.  It&#39;s not what we model for him in real life.  I was<br/>\n&gt; hoping that our influence would be the dominate one, but it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; to be.  I&#39;m seeing behaviors exhibited in both my sons that are<br/>\n&gt; concerning to me and it is tempting to just pull the plug on the TV.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course I know that this would just create resentment in my children.

Mix gelatin into boiling water - a  <br/>\ncouple of quarts of water  -  until it dissolves. Use a lot - maybe  <br/>\nabout 2 or 3 times what the box says to use for that much water. Pour  <br/>\ninto a medium sized mixing bowl and chill until very well gelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - loosen the mold by running some warm water over the bowl until  <br/>\nyou can dump the molded gel out, in one piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you suck up some paint into an eye dropper - gently insert the  <br/>\neye dropper into the molded gelatin - nice and deep - then slowly  <br/>\nsqueeze out paint - it&#39;s cool if you squeeze while you pull the eye  <br/>\ndropper out. Keep doing that. The paint does some very wonderful  <br/>\nthings and the colors mix and it is just awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another one:<br/>\n<br/>\n2% milk - room temp is best, food coloring, and detergent -- pour  <br/>\nsome milk on a plate - just to the point that it covers the surface.  <br/>\nPut some drops of different colors of food coloring scattered here  <br/>\nand there - try not to disturb the milk surface when you drop them on  <br/>\nit. You can dip a toothpick into some dish detergent and then touch  <br/>\nthe toothpick to the milk. Just wait until you see what happens. TOO  <br/>\nCOOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is chemistry, of course. Or art.

Our new house was not ready before we had to be out of the old one so we moved in with my brother in laws family. My kids were 10 and 8 at the time and had never been allowed(nor ASK) to watch constant TV much less Sponge bob, Simpsons, or King of the Hill.  My in Bil&#39;s kids were constant cartoon TV watchers and never wanted to do anything else.Mine always liked Nature shows or History channel. My kids gave in and stared with the others...(they were made fun of for what they wanted to watch)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were changed very quickly just like you mentioned. They became hateful to each other and everyone else, foul mouthed, and rude.They had always played outdoors and made crafts and invented games.<br/>\n<br/>\n These habits were hard to break after they started and they will never be the same kids. Once something has been seen you cannot take it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont restrict the TV now nor did I before we moved. They just never found the silliness entertaining. Now that we have settled into a new home, They are back outside swimming or hiking. Hunting new bugs and building stuff. They watch the History channel and Animal Planet mostly, but on occasion they will still watch the cartoons they met at my Bil&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nDena<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading the thread on cartoons and<br/>\n&gt; computer games with<br/>\n&gt; interest.  Before I began unschooling last October I<br/>\n&gt; was very strict<br/>\n&gt; about TV viewing and we didn&#39;t even own any video<br/>\n&gt; games.  My boys were<br/>\n&gt; respectful and loving at that time, both to each<br/>\n&gt; other, their friends<br/>\n&gt; and the adults in their lives.  I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>\n&gt; since they started<br/>\n&gt; watching commercial TV (almost exclusively<br/>\n&gt; Nickelodeon), they have<br/>\n&gt; become more rude to each other.  There&#39;s such an<br/>\n&gt; adversarial<br/>\n&gt; relationship between them now.   I hear things come<br/>\n&gt; out of their mouths<br/>\n&gt; that are straight from their shows.  They are also<br/>\n&gt; more disrespectful of<br/>\n&gt; adults and girls (I have two boys).  Again, I see<br/>\n&gt; this modeled after all<br/>\n&gt; the cartoons they watch.  One of my ds3&#39;s favorite<br/>\n&gt; phrases now is, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to kick your butt.&quot;   Since my husband and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t use this type<br/>\n&gt; of language, I know he gets it from TV.  Most of our<br/>\n&gt; friends are still<br/>\n&gt; very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t hear it<br/>\n&gt; from their kids.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad<br/>\n&gt; influences.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; When ds7 was about 5 he discovered a Calvin and<br/>\n&gt; Hobbs book of cartoons<br/>\n&gt; that we had.  At first I thought this was great<br/>\n&gt; because he is an artist<br/>\n&gt; and it was spurring him on to create his own<br/>\n&gt; cartoons and read.<br/>\n&gt; However, very soon after this, he started acting<br/>\n&gt; like Calvin!  We had<br/>\n&gt; several talks about it but I finally just took the<br/>\n&gt; book away thinking he<br/>\n&gt; was too young for it.  Well, recently he asked about<br/>\n&gt; the book again.<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to be a good unschooler, I decided to give<br/>\n&gt; it back to him<br/>\n&gt; because this was where his interests were.  We had a<br/>\n&gt; talk about how<br/>\n&gt; Calvin wasn&#39;t a real person and that in real life,<br/>\n&gt; at least in ours, we<br/>\n&gt; try to work out our challenges in a more respectful<br/>\n&gt; way.  I explained<br/>\n&gt; about how the point of the book was to be funny,<br/>\n&gt; which it was, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; still not appropriate in real life.  He said he<br/>\n&gt; completely understood<br/>\n&gt; and agreed to not use the phrases and behaviors that<br/>\n&gt; Calvin uses.<br/>\n&gt; Well, only a few days later he was at my friends<br/>\n&gt; house, and she told me<br/>\n&gt; about an incident where she had asked him to help<br/>\n&gt; her find his shoes so<br/>\n&gt; they could leave and when she left the room, he was<br/>\n&gt; muttering under his<br/>\n&gt; breath, but loud enough for her to hear.  He was<br/>\n&gt; disgruntled about<br/>\n&gt; helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; why I have to help<br/>\n&gt; that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; He hasn&#39;t asked for the book since them, so I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t addressed it with<br/>\n&gt; him.

Before I began unschooling last October I<br/>\n&gt; was very strict<br/>\n&gt; about TV viewing and we didn&#39;t even own any video<br/>\n&gt; games.  My boys were<br/>\n&gt; respectful and loving at that time, both to each<br/>\n&gt; other, their friends<br/>\n&gt; and the adults in their lives.  I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>\n&gt; since they started<br/>\n&gt; watching commercial TV (almost exclusively<br/>\n&gt; Nickelodeon), they have<br/>\n&gt; become more rude to each other.  There&#39;s such an<br/>\n&gt; adversarial<br/>\n&gt; relationship between them now.   I hear things come<br/>\n&gt; out of their mouths<br/>\n&gt; that are straight from their shows.  They are also<br/>\n&gt; more disrespectful of<br/>\n&gt; adults and girls (I have two boys).  Again, I see<br/>\n&gt; this modeled after all<br/>\n&gt; the cartoons they watch.  One of my ds3&#39;s favorite<br/>\n&gt; phrases now is, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to kick your butt.&quot;   Since my husband and I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t use this type<br/>\n&gt; of language, I know he gets it from TV.  Most of our<br/>\n&gt; friends are still<br/>\n&gt; very strict about TV viewing, so I don&#39;t hear it<br/>\n&gt; from their kids.  In<br/>\n&gt; fact, my children have now become the &#39;bad<br/>\n&gt; influences.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; When ds7 was about 5 he discovered a Calvin and<br/>\n&gt; Hobbs book of cartoons<br/>\n&gt; that we had.  At first I thought this was great<br/>\n&gt; because he is an artist<br/>\n&gt; and it was spurring him on to create his own<br/>\n&gt; cartoons and read.<br/>\n&gt; However, very soon after this, he started acting<br/>\n&gt; like Calvin!  We had<br/>\n&gt; several talks about it but I finally just took the<br/>\n&gt; book away thinking he<br/>\n&gt; was too young for it.  Well, recently he asked about<br/>\n&gt; the book again.<br/>\n&gt; Wanting to be a good unschooler, I decided to give<br/>\n&gt; it back to him<br/>\n&gt; because this was where his interests were.  We had a<br/>\n&gt; talk about how<br/>\n&gt; Calvin wasn&#39;t a real person and that in real life,<br/>\n&gt; at least in ours, we<br/>\n&gt; try to work out our challenges in a more respectful<br/>\n&gt; way.  I explained<br/>\n&gt; about how the point of the book was to be funny,<br/>\n&gt; which it was, but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; still not appropriate in real life.  He said he<br/>\n&gt; completely understood<br/>\n&gt; and agreed to not use the phrases and behaviors that<br/>\n&gt; Calvin uses.<br/>\n&gt; Well, only a few days later he was at my friends<br/>\n&gt; house, and she told me<br/>\n&gt; about an incident where she had asked him to help<br/>\n&gt; her find his shoes so<br/>\n&gt; they could leave and when she left the room, he was<br/>\n&gt; muttering under his<br/>\n&gt; breath, but loud enough for her to hear.  He was<br/>\n&gt; disgruntled about<br/>\n&gt; helping.  He was saying things like, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>\n&gt; why I have to help<br/>\n&gt; that fat little woman!&quot;   Now how Calvin is that?<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; He hasn&#39;t asked for the book since them, so I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t addressed it with<br/>\n&gt; him.  I want to take the book away, but I feel so<br/>\n&gt; unschooly about that.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m stuck between seeing the negative effects of the<br/>\n&gt; things he finds<br/>\n&gt; enjoyable and allowing him to discover and learn in<br/>\n&gt; his own way.  And<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t even get me started on the influence of all<br/>\n&gt; the commercials they<br/>\n&gt; are now watching!   <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; When we weren&#39;t watching the shows he wants to<br/>\n&gt; watch, I didn&#39;t see this<br/>\n&gt; type of behavior.  It&#39;s not what we model for him in<br/>\n&gt; real life.  I was<br/>\n&gt; hoping that our influence would be the dominate one,<br/>\n&gt; but it doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; to be.  I&#39;m seeing behaviors exhibited in both my<br/>\n&gt; sons that are<br/>\n&gt; concerning to me and it is tempting to just pull the<br/>\n&gt; plug on the TV.  Of<br/>\n&gt; course I know that this would just create resentment<br/>\n&gt; in my children.   I<br/>\n&gt; feel like I&#39;ve opened Pandora&#39;s Box and that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; too late to take it<br/>\n&gt; all back.  I think I could handle this all better if<br/>\n&gt; I was the only one<br/>\n&gt; experiencing this rude behavior, but it&#39;s really a<br/>\n&gt; challenge to see them<br/>\n&gt; acting it out with other adults and kids.  <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for your thoughts and experiences in this<br/>\n&gt; area.<br/>\n&gt; Sunday<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

This led on<br/>\nto water ph and a bit of chemistry, the water cycle and conservation and<br/>\nthen they watched Lord Of the Rings and wanted to learn about castles<br/>\nand medieval history. Thomas the Tank Engine inspired an interest in the<br/>\nworking of steam trains. My dd learnt about Forensic medicine after<br/>\nwatching Quinsy( for weeks lol).   My eldest son is learning Egytology<br/>\nas a knock on from all the ancient history he got interested in due to<br/>\nplaying Civilisation, Age of Mythology and Rome Total War on his<br/>\ncomputer. He has been offered an early uni place next year to do history<br/>\nif he wants it but that was not the point of it all.  I never imagined<br/>\nany of these pursuits would lead on to any of the further learning it<br/>\ndid.

What she has been interested in as a possible future career is biblical archaeology. This is also fueled in part by her Christian beliefs and interest in ancient Egypt (which she discovered an interest in through playing YuGiOh).

Is this <br/>\nwhere strewing comes  in?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\n <br/>\nHi Amanda!  Would you feel the same way if a child did little more  than <br/>\nread, or play a musical instrument?  I know before I started  unschooling, I felt <br/>\nthis way.  I let society hand me a prejudice.<br/>\n <br/>\nA child&#39;s brain (and an adult&#39;s for that matter!) is always having a  <br/>\nconversation, making connections, thinking.  It can be a conversation with  an <br/>\ninstrument, a book, a person, a video game, a tv show, a baseball/bat, his  body, <br/>\nhis own thoughts and sometimes all the above at the same  time.   Sometimes a <br/>\nbrain wants some rest, or maybe just mull over  some of those connections and <br/>\nmaybe not necessarily cognitively.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also believe that using the brain is using the brain.  In other  words, if <br/>\nyou like to walk or run for fitness, you are using your  heart.   While your <br/>\nheart gets stronger and you can walk or run  faster, your heart is also <br/>\nstronger for all the other zillions of things you do  all day, not just walking.  An <br/>\nexercised brain is an exercised brain.   While you may be reading a book about <br/>\ndinosaurs, are dinosaurs really  all your brain comes away with from that <br/>\nreading session?  What if the  information in that book wasn&#39;t correct, a picture <br/>\nwas labeled incorrectly, are  you forever going to refuse to rename that <br/>\ndinosaur?  No, when the correct  info. comes along, you say &quot;oh, I thought that <br/>\nwas a brontosaurus, now I will  call it a brachiosaurus.&quot;  No big deal.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, we want our children to live rich lives and be exposed to a  <br/>\nmyriad of ideas and things.  It is natural for most of us to seek out  different <br/>\nexperiences.  If not, humanity might still only be eating berries  and living in <br/>\ncaves.<br/>\n <br/>\nA child that is supported (and even better with a parent that is  <br/>\nwholeheartedly interested in what the child is interested in!) and that lives in  a rich <br/>\nenvironment...even if that environment isn&#39;t &quot;taken advantage of&quot;, will  <br/>\nexperience a full life.  It will not necessarily look like the neighbor&#39;s,  the <br/>\nschooled kid&#39;s, the urbanite&#39;s, the rural&#39;s, his sister&#39;s or his  parents!<br/>\n <br/>\nOne more thing, (and I&#39;ll shut up  :) ) as I understand it,  &quot;well-rounded&quot; <br/>\nis a term that was used by the elite classses.  Their lives  were really <br/>\nboring, they had no real work to do, so it became important to be a  well-rounded <br/>\nperson in order not to bore the pants off everybody at the social  functions.  <br/>\nWith the rise of the middle class, they snapped up the idea so  they could be <br/>\nlike the elite.  Also, it is a great time filler for 12+  years, 180 days, 6 <br/>\nhours a day of confinement, uh I mean &quot;education&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t see how a child with access to books, tv and computer could help  not <br/>\nlearn a million different ideas.  My son that LOVES tv can pick out  chinese <br/>\ncharacters as chinese.  Where the heck did that come from?  He  can show me <br/>\nseveral countries on a map, although we have only discussed a few  (my DH is in <br/>\nJapan, so we purposely discussed that one).  Learning happens  because we are <br/>\nborn to learn.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232627122,"authorName":"Judith Anderson","from":"&quot;Judith Anderson&quot; &lt;segwyne@...&gt;","profile":"kblackclaw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Cartoons and computer games","postDate":"1123430255","msgId":5933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjUwMWM1OWI2OCRiYWQ4YzY4MCQ5MDhkNmQ0NkBtb21kYWQ+","referencesHeader":"PGRkNTlrbStwN28wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5932,"nextInTopic":5934,"prevInTime":5932,"nextInTime":5934,"topicId":5931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am still new to this myself, so I may be way off track.

That is when I suggest calling<br/>\none of their friends to see about getting together to play.  Usually when<br/>\nthey are bored, anything I suggest around the house is &quot;BO-RING!&quot;  I would<br/>\nsay that this is a great opportunity for strewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Cartoons and computer games","postDate":"1123429982","msgId":5932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGMkUyM0IzLTU4MjMtNEIxNy1BQ0JFLTY4RTExQ0Q2REJERkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRkNTlrbStwN28wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRkNTlrbStwN28wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5931,"nextInTopic":5933,"prevInTime":5931,"nextInTime":5933,"topicId":5931,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I hear how not to <br/>\nworry because they are making connections and learning. Does the <br/>\ntelevison and game playing become a habit that is all the child then <br/>\nwants to do. They may pick up snippets of information from cartoons, <br/>\nbut compared to the hours watching, it seems little knowledge return <br/>\nreally.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes the child is having fun, but what skills are they learning that <br/>\nthey can use in the world outside their home? What skills will they <br/>\nget that can help them function as adults? How can this compare to <br/>\nschooled peers who are learning a variety of different things?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know we live in a technological society, but shouldn&#39;t a childs <br/>\nworld have more in it than just cartoons and computer games?
