Each night before I go to bed I <br/>\ncan &quot;fill&quot; his boxes with serving sizes.  I&#39;ll just have to be aware <br/>\nof when he is awake in the morning as he does like a cooked meal <br/>\n(usually eggs).  We talk about the need for more protein and <br/>\nsometimes he will tell me that he needs protein.  (Actually all my <br/>\nkids tell me that from time to time.)  I&#39;m thinking he would <br/>\nactually like having all these boxes and bags.  Things he could see <br/>\nas some sort of order.  He could actually get fairly anal about it <br/>\nLOL!  And maybe it would help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past week we did put names on the everyone&#39;s nutty bars and <br/>\neveryone&#39;s chips.

I know Keon will have challenges throughout his life that <br/>\nare going to be unlike the &quot;normal&quot; challenges of life, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant food to be one of those challenges.  I had lots of food control <br/>\nwhen I was growing up, to the point where I couldn&#39;t have fruit or <br/>\ncheese without asking for it first.

Wooohooooo.<br/>\n<br/>\nAw, thanks, Ren.  Yes; I am fairly radical, especially for this part <br/>\nof the country.  Lactating for 9 straight years, having more than 2 <br/>\nchildren, being ultra liberal, gay, a feminist, sahm because I <br/>\n*want* to, living with my ex, vegetarian, and a Disney lover on top <br/>\nof that LOL!!  Today though I&#39;m having one of those &quot;I want to tie <br/>\nmy 6yo up with duct tape&quot; days.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFood is a big issue with Keon.  He has very little ability to &quot;self-<br/>\nregulate&quot; this includes sleeping and eating.  We&#39;ve tried to let him <br/>\nlearn to self-regulate, but he just doesn&#39;t have the ability to.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s part of his &quot;autistic spectrum.&quot;  He truly is a child that <br/>\nneeds a bedtime because he doesn&#39;t have the ability to recognize <br/>\nthat he is tired and go to sleep.  He&#39;s up with the sun whether he <br/>\ngoes to bed at 8 pm or 1 am.  He is tired and I can recognize that <br/>\naround 8 pm each night.  And he is usually asleep within 5 minutes <br/>\nof going to bed.  Sleeping isn&#39;t a problem for him, it is allowing <br/>\nhimself to go to sleep.  He literally needs someone to tell <br/>\nhim &quot;it&#39;s ok to go to bed now.&quot;  Food has been the struggle lately.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s overweight and I know it.  To the point where finding clothes <br/>\nto fit him is nearly impossible.  (he has this odd toddler-shaped <br/>\nbody - big belly, little butt with wide hips).  Clothes tend to be <br/>\neither snug or very baggy (he also is this mysterious size that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t exist).  We&#39;ve even tried &quot;husky&quot; sizes to no avail.  The <br/>\nclothes are really a minor issue, it is the eating that concerns <br/>\nme.  He will just eat and eat and eat.  He doesn&#39;t recognize when he <br/>\nis full.  It isn&#39;t that the food will be taken away or limited, it&#39;s <br/>\nthat he just doesn&#39;t know how to regulate.  There has been a huge <br/>\nargument in our house about food.  Keon tends to eat everything <br/>\nalmost indiscrimenantly.  He will just start eating.  He&#39;s almost <br/>\nlike a little PacMan gobbling up everything in sight.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter what it is (except frozen peas)  he will eat it.  And he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t stop eating even when he has made himself sick from eating.  <br/>\nIt just doesn&#39;t click.  The girls have been screaming at him this <br/>\nmorning because in a matter of 3 days (since I went shopping) he has <br/>\neaten all the chips, all the cheese, all the apples, all the nutty <br/>\nbars, all the cereal, and an entire can of olives.  We essentially <br/>\nare down to 2 eggs, bread, milk, and peanut butter aside from <br/>\ndinnery foods.  So of course the girls are angry because, while they <br/>\ncan self-regulate and decide to or not to eat something, Keon <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  I&#39;m just at my wits&#39; ends to try to figure out a way to come <br/>\nto a resolution here and help Keon have some control over his food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe does tend to be better when he is busy.  He doesn&#39;t eat as much <br/>\nwhen he is around friends, but food is still this huge issue when it <br/>\nis around (Ren, remember the popcorn incident when we went <br/>\nbowling).  Aside from locking the kitchen cabinets and hiding food <br/>\n(which was what was done to me) I can&#39;t figure out a way to help <br/>\nhim.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - pulling her hair out today</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196291069,"authorName":"Daniel MacIntyre","from":"Daniel MacIntyre &lt;daniel.macintyre@...&gt;","profile":"macintyred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]","postDate":"1112783519","msgId":5359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUwNDA2MDMzMTVjNGVmODZhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDA1LjEyMDkxMi4yMzQ5My4yMzExOTlAd2VibWFpbDEyLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDUwNDA1LjEyMDkxMi4yMzQ5My4yMzExOTlAd2VibWFpbDEyLm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5358,"nextInTopic":5361,"prevInTime":5358,"nextInTime":5360,"topicId":5358,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"- not my favorite quote - however, I m not a big shellfish eater either. ... -- Daniel (Amy is doing a half marathon for Team in Training Anyone who wants to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1159576456\">- not my favorite quote - however, I&#39;m not a big shellfish eater either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Apr 5, 2005 2:08 PM, Ren &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Michelle - who watched her children make crowns today and go through<br/>\n&gt; a very lawyeresque argument over queens, kings, princesses and<br/>\n&gt; successions and kept wanting to quote &quot;And so the time has come my<br/>\n&gt; dears to speak of many things.
