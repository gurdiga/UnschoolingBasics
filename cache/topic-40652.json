He&#39;s old enough to understand a bit more, have you tried explaining in simple terms why he needs to stay in the seat (in an informational kind of way)? Perhaps you could tell him that if he needs to stretch his legs for a while he can *ask* you to pull over for a few minutes and you will- this only works if you actually *will* though. My two year old responds really well to this kind of thing because he knows when he asks I will respond immediately. And it works well for me because I know he wont do whatever dangerous thing it is without letting me know. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout knowing the reason your DS&#39;s getting out of the seat, its hard to offer more advice.

We had a child who did (and still, at 12  <br/>\nLOVES to do this). Give him cookie sheets and let him smear crisco or  <br/>\nbutter on them.

Buy a squirt bottle of lotion and have  <br/>\nhim squirt it all into a bowl, and use a spatula to put it back in.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour best bet is to spend the next six months watching him very  <br/>\nclosely and when he gets into something at your parent&#39;s house,  <br/>\nredirect him &quot;Oh, you want to play with vaseline?

(Particularly with a Britax, they should not be able to get out of it.) I&#39;m not sure if your son is able to unbuckle it or just is sliding out of the straps, but my son was pulling the harness down and undoing his arms. A car seat technician told me that there should only be a finger width between belt and collarbone.  My son hated it being tight, but I explained to him that it was for his safety.  No ifs, ands and buts when it comes to safety issues.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that specific items should be kept out of reach if at all possible.

He may not have to be in a carseat. In SC you can use a seatbelt at 2 (at least you could when my son was that age). As for the smearing things, just keep them out of his view and reach. ;) My son did that stuff. Actually more poured it out or mixed it all up. Even put my dad&#39;s BP pills in water to see what they would do (he was like 9). Let him smear and mix different things on something that&#39;s ok like paper outside or in the tub. \r<br/>\nBeth\r<br/>\nSent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-----Original Message-----\r<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wtsai@...\">wtsai@...</a>\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDate: Sat, 27 Jun 2009 20:14:24 \r<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysUnschooled@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;\r<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] help - redirecting is not working\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nHi Ladies,\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n    Redirecting is not working for me, any idea how to talk to my children?  \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nEx: I have two car seats: marathon and roundabout\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMy soon to be 3 year old son is an escape artist.  while I was driving home from nyc from visiting family yesterday he has come out of the car seat at least 3 times while I was driving 65 +.  Any idea how to stop this?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nHe also like to put Vaseline, butter, baby vics and etc on the my parents hard wood floor/beddings and I have ask him to stop.  He keeps on doing it.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMy husband is unhappy with me as I don&#39;t like time out / hitting / yelling.  I have find myself to be doing all of it them.  How do you guys do it?  He said I’m too extreme in my parenting style and I’m not working with him.  Any ideas?\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThanks\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWendy\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":316912897,"authorName":"wtsai@verizon.net","from":"wtsai@...","profile":"wtsai@verizon.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"help - redirecting is not working","postDate":"1246158864","msgId":40652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg0MjE2My4yMTI4Ny5xbUB3ZWI4NDEwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40653,"prevInTime":40651,"nextInTime":40653,"topicId":40652,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Ladies,       Redirecting is not working for me, any idea how to talk to my children?    Ex: I have two car seats: marathon and roundabout   My soon","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-515935479\">Hi Ladies,<br/>\n <br/>\n    Redirecting is not working for me, any idea how to talk to my children?  <br/>\n <br/>\nEx: I have two car seats: marathon and roundabout<br/>\n <br/>\nMy soon to be 3 year old son is an escape artist.  while I was driving home from nyc from visiting family yesterday he has come out of the car seat at least 3 times while I was driving 65 +.  Any idea how to stop this?<br/>\n <br/>\nHe also like to put Vaseline, butter, baby vics and etc on the my parents hard wood floor/beddings and I have ask him to stop.  He keeps on doing it.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy husband is unhappy with me as I don&#39;t like time out / hitting / yelling.  I have find myself to be doing all of it them.  How do you guys do it?  He said I’m too extreme in my parenting style and I’m not working with him.  Any ideas?<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\n <br/>\nWendy<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40468,"nextTopicId":40699}}
