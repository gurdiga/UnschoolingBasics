I knew her well <br/>\nenough to know that every decision she made would be right for her <br/>\nat that time or she&#39;d merge into a new path if it wasn&#39;t. I really <br/>\nhad no expectations, other than for her to be happy. When she <br/>\nstarted fretting in her late teens about what she was going to do <br/>\nwith the rest of her life, I explained to her that the restlessness <br/>\nshe was feeling was her body/mind/soul becoming aware of the need <br/>\nfor a change and b/m/s were all searching for what exactly that <br/>\nchange would be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never had the nagging doubts. I loved it when her mind would hear <br/>\na new idea (to her) and she&#39;d immerse herself in learning about it. <br/>\nShe&#39;d know right where she stood on the idea and just how much of <br/>\nthe idea to adopt for herself. She often took it further than it had <br/>\nbeen taken and get really involved. Hence her title as the Resident <br/>\nRadical at college. She was on the news picketing places more than a <br/>\nfew times. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI took her decisions about what &quot;to do&quot; with her life seriously and <br/>\nsupported her in those decisions. Sometimes she stuck with them for <br/>\nawhile and at other times she decided rather quickly that it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsuch a great choice for her. She always discusses her plans with me <br/>\nand she always gets my support. That way she feels free to drop them <br/>\nand not worry about mom getting all weird about it. She&#39;s watched me <br/>\nchange paths several times during her lifetime and she knows that <br/>\nthere are many paths to choose from that will be right for her at <br/>\ndifferent times in her life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not content to stay in one place in my life for very long. I go <br/>\nfrom one thing to the other, quitting when it&#39;s not right for me and <br/>\ngoing on to something else...with no apologies. I enjoy my life and <br/>\nI feel no guilt about not finishing the pottery class (for instance) <br/>\nwhen it made my wrists hurt. My parents have belittled my choices as <br/>\nfar back as I can remember. I made a vow to never do that to Laurie. <br/>\n***Thank you so much for this post, Valerie!  It is definitely a keeper!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2788,"nextTopicId":2793}}
