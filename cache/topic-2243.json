Although my dd didn&#39;t have siblings, <br/>\nshe was/IS very high needs/spirited and hated the slings as well.  I really, <br/>\nreally wanted to use a sling, but she&#39;d have no part of it : )  I think it felt <br/>\ntoo confining for her.  What I did find she loved was the baby bjorn.  She <br/>\nliked being UP and facing out at the world...she had to SEE what was going on all <br/>\nthe time and then she was happy.  Then in a few months, when she started <br/>\ngetting heavy in the front carrier, we found a light framed backpack that she <br/>\nLOVED.  The only way she&#39;d take a nap was if she was in that backpack and watching <br/>\nme do my housework or out on walks...or whatever.   So, I&#39;d just suggest <br/>\ntrying other styles of carriers...hopefully you&#39;ll find one that she likes because <br/>\nit is SO freeing and you&#39;ll be able to be more interactive w/the littles.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nDenise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2233,"nextTopicId":2234}}
