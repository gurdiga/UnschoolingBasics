Quite the contrary, I believe my kids are still <br/>\nlearning the nuances of interpersonal relations and &quot;expectations,&quot; or, <br/>\nas I would be more comfortable phrasing and considering it, <br/>\nconsideration of others &quot;needs,&quot; and I believe that part of my job as <br/>\ntheir parent is to help them negotiate and consider others&#39; needs, <br/>\nincluding my own. I don&#39;t &quot;expect&quot; my kids to know how to &quot;treat each <br/>\nother and their parents respectfully&quot; or to even know what that means at <br/>\ntheir age, nor do I &quot;expect&quot; them to be perfect practitioners of that at <br/>\nany age, as I&#39;m certainly not perfect by any stretch. I think sometimes <br/>\nthat parents have the tendency to hold their children to higher <br/>\nstandards than they hold themselves to, and I find that particularly <br/>\nproblematic, whether it be in the context of behavior or health or <br/>\nwhatever. If I can&#39;t always do whatever myself, then I have no business <br/>\n&quot;expecting&quot; whatever from anyone else, basically. Though, there&#39;s a big <br/>\ndifference between not being perfect and being regularly abusive, iykwim.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (7), Sam (6)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201330991,"authorName":"Queana","from":"&quot;Queana&quot; &lt;queana7@...&gt;","profile":"queanabruedal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Rules vs. expectations; unschooling vs. parenting","postDate":"1151887652","msgId":15258,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4OXBmNCtya3F1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15262,"prevInTime":15257,"nextInTime":15259,"topicId":15258,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Something someone asked over on the new unelite unschooling list inspired me to blurt all this out, which I ve never really put into writing before. I m","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-840783362\">Something someone asked over on the new &quot;unelite unschooling&quot; list <br/>\ninspired me to blurt all this out, which I&#39;ve never really put into <br/>\nwriting before.<br/>\nI&#39;m curious what the response would be from &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; to <br/>\nmy thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think applying the term &quot;unschooling&quot; to other topics <br/>\nregarding children and choices is a misnomer.  It just doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nsense to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always had a respectful, trusting, non-punitive relationship <br/>\nwith my kids (albeit never perfectly).  Yet they have been in school <br/>\nuntil this year.  By their choice.  Homeschooling was always given <br/>\nto them as an option.  It was finally chosen.  They always had a <br/>\ntotally different range of choices, and a totally different <br/>\nrelationship with us than did their friends.  &quot;Freedoms&quot; such as <br/>\nwhat and how much tv, videogames, books, food, activities, etc. to <br/>\nhave and use.  Again, we have never been perfectly consistent, but <br/>\nhave always strived for that ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children have always been happy, trusting and wonderful people, <br/>\nwho have learned many, many things of their own volition and in <br/>\ntheir own free time and love learning.  Yet they have always been in <br/>\nschool until this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo many of the traits and qualities and successes of unschooling I <br/>\nsee as traits and qualities and successes of decent parenting which <br/>\nis found in all walks of life (albeit not very often), not just <br/>\namong those who don&#39;t use a structured curriculum for homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read, and not participated much, on unschooling lists for <br/>\nseveral years because that is where (on the internet) I found people <br/>\nmost in line with my philosophy towards my children.  But I&#39;ve <br/>\nalways been a little bit baffled by the implication that unschooling <br/>\nis the only way to have that kind of relationship with your kids, <br/>\nand that lack of curriculum necessarily goes along with lack of <br/>\nrules so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that seems strange to me is the idea that respectful <br/>\nand trusting relationships imply a lack of expectations.  I have a <br/>\nrespectful and trusting relationship with my husband, yet I have <br/>\nexpectations of him.  I expect him to be respectful of me and our <br/>\nkids.  I expect him to carry a share in our family partnership that <br/>\nwe agreed upon, which includes both of us producing income, keeping <br/>\nthe house livable, feeding the family, and taking care of the kids.  <br/>\nIf I feel he isn&#39;t meeting my expectations, and I examine them to <br/>\nsee if they are reasonable, we will talk about it.  Unless I get all <br/>\npissy and yell about it first, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the same way I have expectations of my kids.  I expect them to <br/>\ntreat each other and their parents respectfully.  I expect them to <br/>\nparticipate in keeping the house straightened up at their own <br/>\nability level.  I expect them to help take care of our animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy family also has expectations of me.  They expect me to <br/>\nparticipate in keeping the house up, producing income, taking care <br/>\nof them, helping them when they need help, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpectations are fluid; if I&#39;m sick, nobody expects me to make <br/>\ndinner.  If my husband lost his job nobody would expect him to <br/>\nproduce income until he found another way to do that.  If someone is <br/>\nout of town, others take care of that person&#39;s animals.  If my <br/>\nhusband or I decided we didn&#39;t want to produce income any more, we <br/>\nwould discuss how to make that work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t see any mistrust or disrespect in our family dynamics due to <br/>\nthese expectations that we have of each other.  Nothing is designed <br/>\nto teach anybody a lesson or to make sure they &quot;turn out&quot; a certain <br/>\nway.  It is simply the way we live together in harmony (obviously <br/>\nnot harmony all the time, but that&#39;s the purpose of it).  Of course, <br/>\nthe idea of expectations could be used to excuse all kinds of <br/>\nnegative actions within a family, and maybe that is why it is not <br/>\ntalked about much within the context of radical unschooling.  <br/>\nExpectations do not equal rules; do not lead to mistrust, dishonesty <br/>\nor sneakiness; can lead to satisfaction for everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... in my opinion, having a trusting and cooperative relationship <br/>\nwith your children is a wonderful idea that coincides wonderfully <br/>\nwith unschooling but shouldn&#39;t fall under the definition of <br/>\nunschooling as intended by John Holt;<br/>\nand, having a trusting and cooperative relationship with your <br/>\nchildren does not require a lack of mutual expectations within that <br/>\nrelationship.  Since parents hold the Big-People-Money-Maker power <br/>\nwithin the relationship it is their responsibility to be constantly <br/>\nsoul-searching and vigilant regarding that relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts, anyone? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Q~</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15288,"nextTopicId":15220}}
