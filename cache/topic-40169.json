Have you  <br/>\nread The Explosive Child? That has some ideas on how to do it with  <br/>\nchildren, I just apply it to me! Also remember:<br/>\nH- hungry<br/>\nA- angry<br/>\nL- lonely, needing attention<br/>\nT- tired or thirsty<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will help with a lot of out bursts. Another way is to build you  <br/>\ntool collection. Build it full of beautiful loving tools. Listen to  <br/>\naudio of cons like Diana suggested, read insightful books which are  <br/>\nlisted in a database on the unschooling basics site, read Sandra and  <br/>\nJoyces pages and hang up inspirational stuff around the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of saying I&#39;ll never tantrum again think about what othertools  <br/>\nyou have, I will use XYZ instead of yelling next time. Have game plans  <br/>\nin line for common mishaps such as spills.<br/>\n<br/>\nMove on. Guilt and feeling like crap about your learning takes are not  <br/>\ngoing to solve the issue, thank yourself and your child for this  <br/>\nopportunity to know yourself deeper ave become a better person. Love  <br/>\nyour child, apologize, learn from your mistakes and move on. When I  <br/>\nstarted doing that my daughter thanked me.

I understand I&#39;ve always been high strung  quick to have a tantrum (when I was a infant even-- so my mom says) and up to now.  example child spills coffee I know it should and is know big deal that why i have hard wood floors right?  and no big deal he pooped in his underwear? but why do I get frustrated ?  inconvenient to me?  god forbid he interrupted my reading! <br/>\n    Anyone else out there that has had to really, really work on their &#39;temper&#39;?  I have posted in past but I often step away for awhile.  almost like I have to digest stuff , think it over and implement stuff (or not in this case) and than I&#39;m back ready to let go, search, understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  while I&#39;ve been unschooling i&#39;ve learned to say why not? say yes more. let go of old issues (like are they going to learn if not in school?? duh yeah-- full fledge belief now in learning naturally...) I catch myself faster and shut up quicker, apologize hug and thank more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n but I still haven&#39;t learned to let the temper go... I believe there are times we have a right to be angry but we can express ourselves without yelling and saying things that are just stupid.  (i&#39;m also good at blaming -- like I&#39;m trying not to yell but your doing things to piss me off) nice huh.  no got to stop this it&#39;s my problem not theirs and I&#39;ve had conversations telling my boys that they are my biggest teachers and that I am learning .....<br/>\n<br/>\ntalk to me please.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40259,"nextTopicId":40258}}
