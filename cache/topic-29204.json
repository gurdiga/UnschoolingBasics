I also just spent a little over a year with my dp deployed. I have 3 kids now, one of which I had about halfway through my dp&#39;s deployment. So, I had to be a single parent temporarily. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My teenager had pretty much free reign. As long as he didn&#39;t disturb me while I was sleeping he could stay up as late as he wanted. My other 2 are younger, just turned 4 years and 7 months. We do have a bedtime with them but it&#39;s based on when everyone gets sleepy. Also, it&#39;s not written in stone. If someone falls asleep earlier, that&#39;s fine. Or, if our normal bedtime comes and someone&#39;s not sleepy, they are not forced to go to bed. I needed the bedtime just as much as the LOs because by the end of the day I was so tired that I had nothing left.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The only suggestion I have is to hire a mother&#39;s helper if you can. They are much cheaper than a housekeeper but can really take the load off of the daily chore grind. Even if you have someone come just a couple times a week, it can really help. They can also watch your kids if you&#39;d like, so you can run a quick errand or just get a much needed 15 minute bath. My dp just got home yesterday. Last night I snuck off and took a really hot bath. It been since before he left (over a year) since I had been able to take a bath by myself.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
