My husband can&#39;t spell worth beans but <br/>\nspell check works great for him and he makes a darn good living for <br/>\nus and has an extremely high IQ so I don&#39;t think it has effected his <br/>\nlife in a negative way at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that I was really concerned about was my sons <br/>\ngrammar and it was the one thing that I would wake up in the middle <br/>\nof the night worrying about, even though I never mentioned or pushed <br/>\nit at all.  He is now 13 and has wonderful spelling, punctuation, <br/>\nand grammar!!  He didn&#39;t learn it from me because I never gave him a <br/>\nformal lesson but he picked it up from somewhere, namely unlimited <br/>\ncomputer use and lots of reading.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your son?  Sometimes these fears arise out of fear of <br/>\nwhat people will think of us if our kids are not &quot;up to grade <br/>\nlevel&quot;.  He isn&#39;t in school so you need not worry if he is learning <br/>\nat a different pace than someone else and you certainly don&#39;t need <br/>\nto worry about spelling in a world with spell check.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other son will be 11 this summer and is just beginning to read on <br/>\nhis own.  I never worried because my sister&#39;s son was 11 or 12 <br/>\nbefore he learned how to read and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if he <br/>\nlearned to read at 6 or just recently.  Every child is unique and <br/>\nthe more you let go the more you will see learning happening all on <br/>\nits own.
