Ask your husband how many of his High School buddies are still sitting on the same bar stools at the local bars in Anaconda......that should get a laugh out of him. It&#39;s a joke with my father and I that a lot the people I went to high school with are still sitting on the same bar stools. My husband and I just moved here to SC about 11 months ago from NJ. My husband grew up in NJ and I was there for 12 years. The first<br/>\ntime I brought my husband to Montana was about 10 years ago. It was such an experience for my husband.

I think my Mom sees the things that go on at the Anaconda High School, and well that&#39;s enough for her to think that Homeschooling is the right thing to do. And like I&#39;ve said my father is a liberal nut, and he totally get&#39;s it. My brother has lots of friends that homeschool their kids so he thinks it&#39;s great. It&#39;s my hubby&#39;s family that is extremely anti-homeschooling and they just can&#39;t grasp that their are other ways to raise children other than the traditional way. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie, are you also from Montana?
