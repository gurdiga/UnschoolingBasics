Well, we cancelled that dinner, and what do you know?<br/>\nMatt has grown up to be quite civilized nonetheless.  They are toddlers for<br/>\nonly a very few minutes (in the scheme of things), and that is not the time<br/>\nfor grown-up dinners and sophisticated gatherings.  There will be plenty of<br/>\ntime for those things (if you choose) later on, but not now...not today.  We<br/>\narranged our life around our child&#39;s needs (still do), and that hasn&#39;t<br/>\nspoiled him, that has made him a secure child whose needs have been/are<br/>\nbeing met.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople act like today is permanent; will they never learn?
