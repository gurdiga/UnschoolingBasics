My objection to<br/>\nwatching isn&#39;t that I necessarily think it isn&#39;t &quot;educational&quot;, if I may be<br/>\nforgiven for using that word. I still tend to think that it is, in fact,<br/>\nsomewhat addictive (not like cocaine, but perhaps like marijuana...which<br/>\nhasn&#39;t had any studies that unarguably demonstrate it is harmful either and<br/>\ncertainly it isn&#39;t incredibly addictive) so that it isn&#39;t quite a matter of<br/>\ntrusting my child to turn it off...I think that perhaps some kids might need<br/>\nHELP in turning it off (once it is on in the first place).<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThen how do you explain that all our kids aren&#39;t &quot;addicted&quot; to TV? How do you explain that<br/>\nour kids CAN turn it off even when it&#39;s on in the first place?<br/>\n <br/>\nTrust.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd besides the addictive part, I really don&#39;t like that advertisers and TV<br/>\nprofessionals are being allowed into my home freely to seek out my children<br/>\nand get them to want things...things that they would not have wanted or<br/>\nknown about if they had never watched TV in the first place. Not just<br/>\nthings, either, but ways of talking and acting. Unfriendly, whiney ways of<br/>\nacting and talking. Stereotypical ways of acting, like coming to assume that<br/>\nlittle sisters are &quot;a pain and annoying&quot; because that is what is portrayed<br/>\non TV.<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThe advertising: I&#39;d rather my son make a bad $10 decision NOW than a bad $10,000 decision later. I&#39;d rather that he learn HOW advertising works NOW.<br/>\n <br/>\nTalking and acting: I want my children&#39;s worlds BIGGER than what&#39;s at home. We talk about Ed, Edd, and Eddy and Angelica and Red and why they act the way they do---AND that they&#39;re ACTORS playing parts. Usually stereotypes. <br/>\n <br/>\nPlus, children go through phases of trying on different personae. Both of mine have been dogs and superheroes for extended periods. Cameron imitated Bevis and Butthead for months (ugh!)---but it&#39;s a phase. Duncan does Family Guy&#39;s Peter occasionally. Hardly role models! &lt;g&gt; But they KNOW they&#39;re not! They&#39;re just playing. Good thing Tom Hanks&#39; and Sean Connery&#39;s moms didn&#39;t discourage THEM! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-=-=- <br/>\n<br/>\nSo do your kids never ask for things that they have seen on TV? And do you<br/>\nreally not see any behavior changes that you attribute to characters on TV<br/>\nshows? I am asking because I see those things in my kids and the idea of<br/>\nletting them watch unlimited TV is difficult for me to imagine. I truly feel<br/>\nlike I am letting them wander into a forest alone....or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nBoth. But neither lasts. They learn. They grow. And they were never all alone. I was always right there, talking about the chrarcter or the products.

I meant  <br/>\nfrugality as a virtue.....there are those in my family that think themselves  <br/>\nsuperior because they live this value and judge others that don&#39;t.  My  husband grew <br/>\nup in Greece and experienced a culture based more on  abundance.  They throw <br/>\nbig parties and spend lavishly on their  friends.  There is no such thing as <br/>\n&quot;splitting the check&quot; where he grew  up, that was an insult.  I realized after I <br/>\nmarried him that although  there is lots of room for common sense frugality, <br/>\nit didn&#39;t mean it was  &quot;right&quot; as a lifestyle above others.

We have a 3 <br/>\nft tall Tigger body pillow like critter that we got him when he <br/>\nbroke his wrist as a toddler - we&#39;d stretch that along the side of <br/>\nhis crib so that his cast wouldn&#39;t get caught and he could sleep <br/>\nmore comfortably. Then there&#39;s Purple Bear - DH won it for me on our <br/>\nfirst &#39;official&#39; date (which was a couple months after we started <br/>\ndating lol).

What I&#39;ve always heard is that the more you have, the less you <br/>\ncare or appreciate any of it. For example, if you have twenty <br/>\nstuffed animals you might not even notice if you lose one, but if <br/>\nyou have one or two, you will cherish them and they&#39;ll be very <br/>\nspecial to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve ever read The Tightwad Gazette (a very interesting <br/>\ncompilation of newsletters), the author shares a story about going <br/>\nto a garage sale and a boy was selling a TON of GI Joe stuff and <br/>\nalmost seemed to have a certain disdain for them.

They don&#39;t <br/>\nseem to have disdain for their toys or life in general. They don&#39;t <br/>\nseem jaded or having no appreciation. They have more stuffed animals <br/>\nthan we know what to do with, but each has about two Very Special <br/>\nFriends. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway ...

I do cringe a bit  because my <br/>\noldest is not strong on communication skills so I don&#39;t have the  ability to <br/>\nreally discuss things with him like other unschoolers might.   But on his own <br/>\nas he matures (he is nine now), he seems less and less impressed  with the <br/>\nlatest newest thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we first moved to this house about 18 months ago, we got DirecTV for  <br/>\nthe first time.  My kids were glued to PBSKids, which is a 24 hour station  <br/>\nplaying nothing but PBS shows and no real commercials.  I noticed a  dramatic <br/>\nreduction in the stuff they asked for.  Then when they got bored  of that, they <br/>\nstarted watching the channels with commercials and they did start  to ask for <br/>\nthis fantastic toy or that one.  We went through a phase of them  desperately <br/>\nwanting to go to the store every day for this or that.  We  had a loose <br/>\nallowance plan for them and we refined it at that point.   They had a certain amount <br/>\nof money to spend (enough for them to get a decent toy  about every week and a <br/>\nbetter toy every two weeks).  Then that phase waned  as they got used to the <br/>\ncommercials again.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometime in October I saw another huge shift in the asking for this or  that. <br/>\n I remarked to a friend that Christmas must  be coming.....the advertising <br/>\nwas kicked up a notch!  My kids talked  of fantastic toys that do fantastic <br/>\nthings constantly.  Christmas came and  they got a good balance of what they <br/>\nwanted, some things they didn&#39;t know about  and their own shopping money to get <br/>\nwhat they didn&#39;t get for Christmas.  I  haven&#39;t heard much since then (I know it <br/>\nis only Jan. 20th!  but that&#39;s a  long time in kid-years!).<br/>\n <br/>\nI grew up in a household where &quot;wanting&quot; and &quot;getting&quot; were loaded  subjects. <br/>\n It wasn&#39;t really considered a bad thing to want something, and  we had huge <br/>\ngenerous birthdays and Christmases.  But, my mom would always  hear that voice <br/>\nshe grew up with and say &quot;you always get too much, you don&#39;t  need that <br/>\nmuch&quot;.  In her childhood, frugalness was (and still is to much of  my family) the <br/>\nultimate virtue.  Even if someone has plenty of money,  it is frowned upon to <br/>\nspend in any sort of flashy way.  Some don&#39;t own pets  as that is considered a <br/>\nwaste of money.<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel like most of us grew up with some level of these ideals and ever  <br/>\nsince technology met advertising, the allure has increased a thousand fold on  our <br/>\npoor children.  That is scary and uncomfortable for most of us...I  don&#39;t <br/>\nthink we&#39;ve really resolved the frugal vs. abundance thing in our  heads, or in <br/>\nour culture.   So are we reacting with a real  concern for our children or <br/>\nthose familial/cultural voices in our heads?   (By the way, I can&#39;t answer that <br/>\nquestion  :)  )<br/>\n <br/>\nI think our kids are going to have to be prepared for a future of  <br/>\nadvertising even more expanded than we have now.  When we eventually get  Tivo or DVR, I <br/>\nwill happy to reduce the amount of advertising they are exposed  to, but I <br/>\nthink it is a mistake to try to act like it isn&#39;t there.  My  kids are learning <br/>\nabout the power of advertising by seeing that Floam  doesn&#39;t work as <br/>\nadvertised, not by buying a ton of worthless junk on a maxed out  first credit card.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think my kids are going to learn that it is OK to want something, how to  <br/>\nbudget and save, how it feels to spend your money on something that doesn&#39;t  <br/>\ndeliver and how it feels to spend your money on something that does!<br/>\n <br/>\nMy friend with an older girl watches a lot of craft shows with her daughter  <br/>\nand they started Tivo&#39;ing them because she was uncomfortable about the sheer  <br/>\nnumber of weight loss/perfect body commercials.  It was at this age that  she <br/>\nstarted her own food/body issues and she is so uncomfortable with the  <br/>\ncommercials that it made her not want to watch the shows.  She feels she  can manage <br/>\nthe subject on a smaller level, but the shows geared at women had a  constant <br/>\nattack!  The Tivo has been the perfect solution and they have a  great time <br/>\ntogether without the added stress it causes her.<br/>\n <br/>\nSorry so long!

What if they&#39;re twenty, living on their own and discover the  <br/>\nHSN? Having never been exposed to that kind of marketing without the  <br/>\nloving support of family, what will their response be? My brother was  <br/>\n24 when he got ripped off by one of those tv commercials and it cost  <br/>\nhim lots.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids ask for things they see on tv, we talk about it. I ask  <br/>\nwhy it&#39;s appealing. I ask how they plan on getting it. I offer  <br/>\nalternatives, like similar products at local stores. I share  <br/>\nexperiences I have had with ordering stuff. I sometimes offer  <br/>\ncomments and experiences when I see ads on tv. Just a few days ago,  <br/>\nwe saw a cakepan set commercial for a product that I&#39;d been wanting  <br/>\nand found at walmart. The girls (ages seven and five) remarked how  <br/>\nlucky we were we had bought it there, because not only did it cost  <br/>\nmore on tv, there was a remarkably high s&h. Josh (ten) bought some  <br/>\nset online, and when he got it was grossly disappointed by the  <br/>\nquality and how difficult it was to put together. He&#39;s learned a  <br/>\nvaluable lesson in marketing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes I just say &quot;why not?&quot; and we look into buying it. I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to lecture about value or cost or saving money. They see  <br/>\nfor themselves and they are much more cautious next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for attitudes. My kids have experimented with attitudes that they  <br/>\nsee on TV. It&#39;s a role they try on. If I really feel I can&#39;t tolerate  <br/>\nit, then I&#39;ll tell them that the way they are acting hurts me or  <br/>\nbothers me because &lt;reason&gt;. The best way is to playact with them,  <br/>\nit&#39;s fun, they&#39;ve tried the role on, and it&#39;s no longer appealing  <br/>\n(sometimes, the girls are really stuck on British accents right now,  <br/>\nwith snoots in the air and tail feathers awaving!) And it&#39;s not all  <br/>\nbad, the girls have seen a lot of compassion and love and solving  <br/>\nproblems. They aren&#39;t watching it alone either, and usually when  <br/>\nwe&#39;re watching someone will make a comment about how so and so was  <br/>\nmean, or such and so was a great idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this will help, we just started the unlimited tv  <br/>\nourselves, maybe a few weeks ago, but we&#39;re seeing changes.

I still tend to think that it is, in fact,<br/>\nsomewhat addictive (not like cocaine, but perhaps like marijuana...which<br/>\nhasn&#39;t had any studies that unarguably demonstrate it is harmful either and<br/>\ncertainly it isn&#39;t incredibly addictive) so that it isn&#39;t quite a matter of<br/>\ntrusting my child to turn it off...I think that perhaps some kids might need<br/>\nHELP in turning it off (once it is on in the first place).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd besides the addictive part, I really don&#39;t like that advertisers and TV<br/>\nprofessionals are being allowed into my home freely to seek out my children<br/>\nand get them to want things...things that they would not have wanted or<br/>\nknown about if they had never watched TV in the first place. Not just<br/>\nthings, either, but ways of talking and acting. Unfriendly, whiney ways of<br/>\nacting and talking. Stereotypical ways of acting, like coming to assume that<br/>\nlittle sisters are &quot;a pain and annoying&quot; because that is what is portrayed<br/>\non TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do your kids never ask for things that they have seen on TV? And do you<br/>\nreally not see any behavior changes that you attribute to characters on TV<br/>\nshows? I am asking because I see those things in my kids and the idea of<br/>\nletting them watch unlimited TV is difficult for me to imagine. I truly feel<br/>\nlike I am letting them wander into a forest alone....or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - I won&#39;t post anymore about this topic, but I am interested in<br/>\npeople&#39;s experience on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9356,"nextTopicId":9223}}
