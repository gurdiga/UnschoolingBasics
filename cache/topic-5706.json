I know my<br/>\nsons do too on some level. So does my family. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have a hard time understanding why anyone feels it is wrong to lie to a governmental body that has caused massive damage to a human being. Why do you feel it is necessary to play by their rules at this point?  Your children and their safety and peace are far more important than outright lying about their activities.<br/>\nNot that anyone is saying to do that.<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t.  Fulfilling some state requirement is a mute point when you&#39;re dealing with damaged human beings, but you ARE fulfilling the requirements in a unique way.<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m going to ruffle some feathers here...I hope not, but screw the damn schools. Your kid matters more. How moral is it to allow a child to be damaged further? <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you hold on to the handle, she said, it&#39;s easier to maintain the illusion of control. But it&#39;s more fun if you just let the wind carry you. &quot;<br/>\n                   --Brian Andreas<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5710,"nextTopicId":5715}}
