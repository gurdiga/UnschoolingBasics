Fortunately, that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t last long! My kids hated it and so did I! Then we sort of <br/>\nveered toward eclectic homeschooling  we were happier with that, <br/>\nbut we all still felt pressured. Have we done history this week? <br/>\nWhen is the last time we studied science? OMG we haven&#39;t done math <br/>\nin 4 days! Then as luck would have it, we had to move into a <br/>\ndifferent house.

On the advice <br/>\nof a good friend, I decided to just let the kids de-school for a <br/>\nwhile. When I think back I realize that I did it to make myself feel <br/>\nbetter and less guilty!
