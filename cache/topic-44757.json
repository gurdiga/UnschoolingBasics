Like stopping doing something that is bothering me, like the pulling off the shade, or not touching something that I don&#39;t want him to touch...(I know it sounds controlling...ay). I guess I don&#39;t want the computer mouse to brake it cost 50 dollars to get another one and the shade it is a pain to put it back together...So doing some mental shifting and #2 should help!<br/>\n2) I did change the environment so there would be less no&#39;s and more do what you need.

What you need is new wood beneath.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThree things will help replace the rotten wood:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) A mental shift in your expectations and how you view your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA small child sees the world differently. A knocked over glass isn&#39;t a  <br/>\n<br/>\nmess, it&#39;s an experiment in gravity. It&#39;s a big reaction to a small  <br/>\n<br/>\naction. It&#39;s a shiny colorful puddle that may leave a ghost of itself  <br/>\n<br/>\nbehind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGet into their world and see the world through their eyes and their  <br/>\n<br/>\nneeds. What&#39;s it like being so small and helpless that you must rely  <br/>\n<br/>\non the indulgence of others for even the simplest things like a glass  <br/>\n<br/>\nof water or going to the bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty much the main cause of anger, frustration, lashing out is a  <br/>\n<br/>\ndesire to control what can&#39;t be controlled. It&#39;s not healthy to shove  <br/>\n<br/>\ndown the need and pretend it isn&#39;t there. What you need are techniques  <br/>\n<br/>\nto let go of the need to control -- like above, but others might have  <br/>\n<br/>\nmore if you give specific examples --, let go of the expectations that  <br/>\n<br/>\na situation will run a particular way or people will act as you expect  <br/>\n<br/>\nor want them to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Change the environment rather than focusing on what you can&#39;t  <br/>\n<br/>\nchange: your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the child&#39;s actions as communication rather than pushing buttons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey may be trying to meet a need, let you know that they have a need,  <br/>\n<br/>\nor are frustrated a need isn&#39;t being met.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChange the environment. The fewer things there are to say no to, the  <br/>\n<br/>\nmore peaceful the home and you and your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child keeps doing something that bothers you, see it as a need  <br/>\n<br/>\nand either find a way they can do it safely and respectfully or  <br/>\n<br/>\nsomething else they can do instead. If a child is writing on the  <br/>\n<br/>\nwalls, rather than focus on what they can&#39;t do, focus on what they can  <br/>\n<br/>\ndo instead. Do let them know the wall is a no, but redirect them to  <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat they can do. They aren&#39;t being bad, they just have needs they  <br/>\n<br/>\ncan&#39;t figure out how to meet. Put up longs sheets of butcher paper.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFind places where they can write on the walls. Put up some wall board.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure there are lots of places and things to draw on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Be aware of the build up inside you. Get to yourself before you  <br/>\n<br/>\nreach the yelling stage. Do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do 1 and 2 there should be fewer and fewer 3s. But when they do  <br/>\n<br/>\noccur, give your child a hug and think of a specific thing you really  <br/>\n<br/>\nlove about them. Or change the environment. Distract both of you with  <br/>\n<br/>\nsomething different. Make some change to get you off the path.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I read a book that says that children often push your buttons to get  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; you into the ring.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if that&#39;s occasionally true, that view of children is more likely  <br/>\n<br/>\nto steer a mother away from her child -- to remove the buttons from  <br/>\n<br/>\nreach -- rather than toward -- helping him meet a need. (Though I&#39;m  <br/>\n<br/>\nglad it helped you think to remove the shade on the stroller.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t see it as pushing buttons. See it as communication. They don&#39;t  <br/>\n<br/>\nyet know how to tell you what they need. They may not even know what  <br/>\n<br/>\nthey need. The solution isn&#39;t to pull the buttons out of reach but to  <br/>\n<br/>\nmove in closer and help the child get what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is, day after day, &quot;pushing buttons&quot; my first guess would  <br/>\n<br/>\nbe they need more attention. Don&#39;t wait for them to ask (by annoying  <br/>\n<br/>\nyou). Give them an abundance of attention. Some kids need more  <br/>\n<br/>\ntouching and direct interaction than an adult may guess. Children  <br/>\n<br/>\n*are* inconvenient. It helps to let go of the idea of making them more  <br/>\n<br/>\nconvenient. But we can help them be more joyful by tuning into their  <br/>\n<br/>\n(inexpert) communication and either fixing what&#39;s irritating them or  <br/>\n<br/>\ngetting them away from it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the pushing buttons is a right now thing, go through the most  <br/>\n<br/>\nlikely things: hungry, tired, antsy and help them move towards joy  <br/>\n<br/>\nrather than adding to the irritation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE :JJ Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284612436","msgId":44793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1OTY4LjU4MjIyLnFtQHdlYjU2MTA2Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2cWh1dStuamhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44792,"nextInTopic":44794,"prevInTime":44792,"nextInTime":44794,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"JJ, that was hilarious!!!! hahahahaha....the point I guess is to loosen up a bit!  ...

My first thought was that it looked like the blood spatter patterns on crime shows and as I cleaned it, I pretended I was a detective reconstructed what had happened.

I have metastatic breast cancer. This is why I have (and will only have) one child. It also means that I will be incredibly fortunate to still be around when she is as young as 5 or 6 years old. So I feel sometimes like I&#39;m compressing a lot of things into earlier years. I want her to have a strong foundation and to be very independent because she will need that once I go.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am sorry to hear this. How old is your daughter now? I can&#39;t remember if you were the one with the three year old or if that was someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Thirdly, she is an incredibly active child with a very high metabolism. So in order to keep her blood sugar level she has to have a LOT of food. We give her snacks throughout the day, but for her eating isn&#39;t really a 5 minute affair. She needs at least 20 minutes to chew all of the food she needs to eat. (It was easier when I could give her baby food since it&#39;s a little denser calorie wise and more efficient to eat). So some of my need is trying to make dinnertime more efficient by eating when she is eating.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does she have to eat everything that she is going to eat for the evening at dinner time? We have dinner and then we usually have a snack before bed. My girls can&#39;t sleep unless there tummies are topped off. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We only run into issues when she insists on putting her feet on the table even though we ask her not to. Or other similar tests of will.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Little kids do stuff like that for a host of reasons. Mainstream parents may say it is a test of wills. Unschooling, as I understand it, sees it as a kid exploring their environment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;One other thing. I&#39;m still trying to understand exactly what AP is. We practiced EC and cosleeping. We try to use positive discipline. (&quot;Hands up&quot; rather than &quot;don&#39;t touch that&quot;). We try to minimize opportunities for confrontation. But we do have rules. And we have consequences for breaking rules. And we don&#39;t allow the child to run the family. And I am pretty insistent on making sure that DD gets enough sleep since I am convinced that a lot of behavior problems come from overtired children.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There are a lot of websites that explore the foundations of Attachment Parenting. You can do a google search and get some great stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is it that you are trying to get out of unschooling? Most unschooling lists that I have been on advocate moving beyond rules and consequences. Perhaps you need to find a different list to help you with ways to build a foundation that is more in line with what you want. The AP lists might be a better place to start. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Family Dinner (was: dealing with my own anger)","postDate":"1284607243","msgId":44791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2czJlYis1ZHFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxMTExNC42ODc3OC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44790,"nextInTopic":44792,"prevInTime":44790,"nextInTime":44792,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* It might be worth figuring out for yourself: if toddler table manners really are more of a concern than the above, why explore unschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-932791634\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Don;t waste time with trying to mold your child.

Let me give you a few more specifics and maybe the group can come up with some other ideas for us too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, we have one major difference that colors a lot of my parenting decisions. I have metastatic breast cancer. This is why I have (and will only have) one child. It also means that I will be incredibly fortunate to still be around when she is as young as 5 or 6 years old. So I feel sometimes like I&#39;m compressing a lot of things into earlier years. I want her to have a strong foundation and to be very independent because she will need that once I go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, it is important to our family to learn proper table manners. It is a value that Dad and I share. And with a limited time frame, I&#39;d rather she learn table manners sooner rather than later because if it&#39;s left to dad alone after I&#39;m gone, he might revert to the way he learned which seems a lot harsher to me. Dad grew up in a very strict household (they &quot;dressed&quot; for dinner every night). But on the other hand, he has flawless manners. The importance of this has been that he is never uncomfortable in any (and I mean any) social situation. He has dined with royalty without having to stress about which one of the 18 pieces of silverware set in front of him he was supposed to use. It seems like a lot of training for a low likelihood situation, but when you are entrepreneurs (as we are), this is a nice skill to have in your toolkit. You never know whom you might meet and what they might be able to do for you. Admittedly, we might wait a little longer for this, but the fact is our DD has extraordinary table manners for her age, so I&#39;d like to not backslide. And she DOES like it when we let her use a knife and fork just like mommy and daddy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThirdly, she is an incredibly active child with a very high metabolism. So in order to keep her blood sugar level she has to have a LOT of food. We give her snacks throughout the day, but for her eating isn&#39;t really a 5 minute affair. She needs at least 20 minutes to chew all of the food she needs to eat. (It was easier when I could give her baby food since it&#39;s a little denser calorie wise and more efficient to eat). So some of my need is trying to make dinnertime more efficient by eating when she is eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo generally, here&#39;s what dinner usually looks like. DD tries to use her knife and fork. Eats some food that way. Then mom or dad helps feed her a little more food. Then she eats a little with her spoon. Then she asks if she can please be excused. And if she has eaten enough that we think she won&#39;t starve before morning then we let her play in the living area next to us while we finish. We only run into issues when she insists on putting her feet on the table even though we ask her not to. Or other similar tests of will.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing. I&#39;m still trying to understand exactly what AP is.  We practiced EC and cosleeping. We try to use positive discipline. (&quot;Hands up&quot; rather than &quot;don&#39;t touch that&quot;). We try to minimize opportunities for confrontation. But we do have rules. And we have consequences for breaking rules. And we don&#39;t allow the child to run the family. And I am pretty insistent on making sure that DD gets enough sleep since I am convinced that a lot of behavior problems come from overtired children.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, my DD is a joy. I am just trying to make sure I give her the best foundation possible before I have to pass on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &quot;mmbz100&quot; &lt;the.nh.attic@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;our child is an only child ... and so I worry about her always eating alone<br/>\n&gt; ***********<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Think about the idea of &quot;eating alone&quot; for a second - is your dd *really* alone when she&#39;d eating? Shut away somewhere or abandoned to her own devices? Probably not. And even if you&#39;re using the five minutes it takes a young child to eat to attend your own needs, are you doing other things with her for most of the day? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A &quot;family meal&quot; makes good sense when the family is all separated during the day. If your husband works out of the home, it may feel good to him and you to have a meal together to reconnect. If he&#39;s wanting to connect with his dd, too, then look for ways for him to spend a little time with her, too - sit and watch a show together, or play a game, or read a story, or help her take a bath. Lots of ways for dad and dd to connect - it doesn&#39;t Have to be dinner. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Maybe I don&#39;t need to worry about family dinner until she&#39;s a little older and then go from there.<br/>\n&gt; **********<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t worry at all! Make dinner time something pleasant that your dd will eventually want to join. That may not be for a few years, and it may not be consistent, but if she sees you and dad having dinner together and enjoying one another&#39;s company, she&#39;ll understand what etaing together is &quot;for&quot;: sociability. She may come sit at the table but not want to eat, or eat a cookie or bowl of cereal - that&#39;s much like running into some friends who are going out to eat and joining them for drinks, or dessert, or just sitting at the restaurant together chit-chatting. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Alternately, you could bring dinner to her - eat where she likes to play, either at a small table or lay out a tablecloth picnic style on the floor. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284585990","msgId":44786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE4MzMxQkIzLUVFNjYtNEI3RC1BMkUxLTBFOTA5MUI4QjdGREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2cmJncCs3a25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2cmJncCs3a25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44785,"nextInTopic":44789,"prevInTime":44785,"nextInTime":44787,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I am constantly finding that my education has really interfered with my ability to unschool and deschool. I think that all of that &quot;training&quot; means that I have to do twice as much deschooling. When I was reflecting on my college education and student teaching experiences in the deschooling process, I realized that the child development courses and other classes were all focused on knowing children so that you could manipulate them into doing what you want them to do. It was all about stripping them of their power yet giving them the illusion of still having a say. The two choices thing mentioned in an earlier post made me think of that. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I think I have deschooled, something else comes up that I have to rethink. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Monica Van Stelton <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 2010 11:36 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: dealing with my own anger<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Meredith.

I think we fell into it because I got lazy and I let myself get too focused on myself. I am not sure why it happened but it did. It&#39;s weird because I fell into old patterns and really beat myself up over losing my way. It seemed like the more I focused on messing up, the more angry I got with myself and everyone around me. I was able to come out of it by doing exactly what Meredith has said above. I had to take it one minute at a time. I had to sit down with the kids and talk to them and tell them how I was feeling. I was feeling like a crappy mom because I was yelling too much. As a result, the kids were yelling too much and getting angry too easy. We talked about it and now we are working on helping each other remember that it is not cool to yell at other people. I am trying to work on using my tools better. (Taking deep breaths, counting to ten, excusing myself to go to the bathroom, going outside to check the mail, being more silly, getting more rest, eating better, getting rid of expectations, stopping and saying in a goofy voice, &quot;Momma needs a hug&quot;, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also realized that I need to work or find a way to get out of the house and get some alone time. I love my kids but I want/need time to recharge my batteries. It is really hard to be present when you are running on empty. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Do some experiementing with different ways to transition from one thing to the next.&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have tried to find ways to eliminate as many transitions as possible. My middle two daughters have a really rough time with transitions. They also don&#39;t do well with surprises. If somebody comes over during the day, my 3 year old will get really annoyed. If we go somewhere and things aren&#39;t as she expects, she will cling to me. As a result, we try to limit the transitions or find ways to make them easier. We try to let them know what to expect as often as possible. Even if you experiment and have a huge tool box of things to try, there may be times that it just doesn&#39;t work. That doesn&#39;t mean that you are a bad mom and it doesn&#39;t mean that there is anything wrong with your child. It just means that kids have bad days too. Things aren&#39;t always going to run smoothly. I think a lot of parents (myself included) get caught up some kind of idealized notion that kids should always be happy and should never have bad days. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls are home bodies. They like to stay home and play with their toys. My 9 year old will come right out and tell me that she doesn&#39;t want to go places because she doesn&#39;t want to think about other people. She doesn&#39;t want to watch what she says and she doesn&#39;t want to get dressed. She would rather stay home and relax and enjoy her stuff. When she told me that, I began to wonder if the little ones were feeling that way too. As a result, we quit planning outings. We hang out close to home. If we need to go shopping, my husband or I try to do it alone. That alone eliminated quite a few transitions and lowered the stress levels tremendously. If we do go out, I try to make sure that there is no schedule so that if somebody gets tired, stressed, hungry, or wants to go home, we can do it without feeling any kind of pressure. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284559909","msgId":44777,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2cWs3NStiN2k3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2cDhnaStqMGkzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44775,"nextInTopic":44778,"prevInTime":44776,"nextInTime":44778,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *********** Think about the idea of eating alone for a second - is your dd *really* alone when she d eating?

Mainly it comes out in demanding my own way and sometimes condemning her for what she&#39;s been doing. I&#39;m like a toddler having a hissy fit and (almost) stomping because I want my own way. I hope I&#39;m giving a clear enough description. I think it&#39;s pretty harmful though not full-on verbal abuse, just to clarify. Her reaction is mainly to be a bit shocked, quiet, and pursue me and give me cuddles and say she loves me. I think that&#39;s probably because my behaviour threatens her connection to me and she has to try to reconnect to her caring Mummy. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s usually triggered by dd not doing what I want, with some other pressure on top of it (like someone else is waiting for us somewhere else, someone else is observing us, or me thinking I&#39;ve had enough and don&#39;t want to continue doing this).

Do let them know the wall is a no, but redirect them to  <br/>\nwhat they can do. They aren&#39;t being bad, they just have needs they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t figure out how to meet.

(Though I&#39;m  <br/>\nglad it helped you think to remove the shade on the stroller.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t see it as pushing buttons. See it as communication. They don&#39;t  <br/>\nyet know how to tell you what they need. They may not even know what  <br/>\nthey need. The solution isn&#39;t to pull the buttons out of reach but to  <br/>\nmove in closer and help the child get what they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is, day after day, &quot;pushing buttons&quot; my first guess would  <br/>\nbe they need more attention. Don&#39;t wait for them to ask (by annoying  <br/>\nyou). Give them an abundance of attention. Some kids need more  <br/>\ntouching and direct interaction than an adult may guess. Children  <br/>\n*are* inconvenient. It helps to let go of the idea of making them more  <br/>\nconvenient.

I wasn&#39;t sure why but then I had an incident with my 3 year old this afternoon that put it into perspective. She was tired and hungry and was melting down. When I asked her what she wanted, she got huffy and angry and told me she didn&#39;t want anything. I could feel myself getting frustrated so I did a quick mental inventory of when she last ate and slept. I knew she was hungry but she refused to take anything. Instead of giving her choices, I got a plate of food for myself and sat down to eat it. She was mad for a few minutes but she eventually came over to me and got some food and the problem was solved. Likewise, there are times that giving her options associated with the car seat do not work. At those times, I tell her that I am going to put her in the car seat and buckle up. Yes, she will fight me but once she is in and we are on our way, things are fine. Most of the time, the fighting with me is associated with her being overly tired or hungry. When she is hungry, we get her in the car and go straight to get food. If she is tired, I know that she will relax and go to sleep once she is in and on the road. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith clothes, I put all of their clothes in tubs or have them hung up in the closet so that they (all 4 girls) can get to their clothes without having to ask me. My 3 year old has very strong opinions and limiting her to two choices would really make her angry. Depending on the temperament of your child, narrowing the choices down to two can make a situation worse. Sometimes, my girls want to have a wider range of choices and sometimes they want me to make the choice for them. There is no one right answer and that can be frustrating because it seems like what works one day doesn&#39;t work the next. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As far as dealing with anger I haven&#39;t figured out yet...I keep telling myself If it is that the way I want my son to behave when he is mad or frustrated....I don&#39;t so I hope at some point I change that...I want to be a perfect mom...I pray for more patience....&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You will never be a perfect mom. There is no such thing as a perfect mom. I have a lot of anger issues. Sometimes I do better than others. When I do bad, I talk to my kids and we forgive each other. Sometimes I take deep breaths and when I exhale I make funny noises that get the kids laughing. I have been known to get whiny and act like a little kid. My kids think it is hilarious. It works really well to change the mood. At bedtime, my younger ones go crazy. We have tried all sorts of things to get them to settle down but it seems like they have quick bursts of energy just before settling down to go to sleep. During those bursts of energy, I sometimes get kicked or hit because they feed off of each other and it seems like they are bouncing off the walls. Most nights, I talk to myself in my head and remind myself that they will crash. They will only be this age once. My 9 year old used to do some of the same things but now she doesn&#39;t. I remember getting mad at her for the same things. Now, I kind of miss her being small enough to cuddle and play like her little sisters do. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284499018","msgId":44765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2b29vYSttMG9pQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUyMTEyMi44Mzc3NC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44764,"nextInTopic":44766,"prevInTime":44764,"nextInTime":44766,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It also helps to honor your own needs - and it sounds like you need to blow off some steam when you&#39;re stressed. So find a way to do that without yelling - come up with some really specific things to do instead. At first those might include yelling &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated&quot; at the ceiling! But that&#39;s Better than yelling something rude at your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, here&#39;s the catch - you won&#39;t &quot;get it right&quot; every time, probably not even Most of the time at first, so a. realize that its a process! don&#39;t beat yourself up! b. focus on &quot;next time&quot; not every time - every time is too big, too much, &quot;next time&quot; is do-able; and c. try to &quot;catch&quot; yourself once you&#39;ve started. C is important! When you find yourself thinking &quot;this isn&#39;t what I want to be doing&quot; stop and do your other thing - stop right in the middle of a sentence and bark like a dog, or take three deep breaths, or tell  your kid you love her, or yell &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated&quot; at the ceiling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It&#39;s usually triggered by dd not doing what I want, with some other pressure on top of it (like someone else is waiting for us somewhere else, someone else is observing us, or me thinking I&#39;ve had enough and don&#39;t want to continue doing this). For example, waiting in the car while she plays and doesn&#39;t want to get in the carseat; or me wanting to sleep and her wanting me with her but she keeps wiggling around and I can&#39;t sleep).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as coming up with a better reaction &quot;in the moment&quot; its really really important to look for ways to change those moments before you get to the shouting stage. Its Great that you can already see a pattern! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you need to shift your expectations as to how long something will take with a toddler - build more time into your plans. Toddlers take a long time to do things! They get distracted by this wonderful world all around them. They putter and play. They also repeat things over and over and over. Do some experiementing with different ways to transition from one thing to the next. Maybe there are times when you could swooop your dd up with a kiss and move her along. Maybe there are times when she needs a few minutes warning (toddlers can rarely keep track of more than a few minutes, though, so don&#39;t jump to 30 minute warnings or you&#39;ll get more frutrated!). Maybe there are times when she needs a prompt like &quot;hop in the car so we can go get ice cream&quot;. Its better to have a bunch of different options for how to do things, too - you&#39;ll find each work better sometimes and not others. But there are also going to be times when the better solution is for You to wait, so have a backup plan for that. Do you have snacks, drinks and projects for You? Be sure you&#39;re taking care of yourself! I used to never go to the store without a bag of food for myself in case Mo wanted to spend a loooooong time looking at things - it saved me from having tantrums!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, be sure to appologise when you lose it. Don&#39;t beat yourself up, but do say you&#39;re sorry. Not only is it helpful in the moment for repairing the situation, its helpful to kids to see adults appoligize. After all, they are going to grow up to be adults who make mistakes - knowing that&#39;s normal and natural and what to do next will be helpful to them down the road. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":409602133,"authorName":"mmbz100","from":"&quot;mmbz100&quot; &lt;the.nh.attic@...&gt;","profile":"mmbz100","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284480461","msgId":44762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2bzZrZCsyY2xuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUyMTEyMi44Mzc3NC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44760,"nextInTopic":44763,"prevInTime":44761,"nextInTime":44763,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with Monica.

Or they respond negative, which is their right, too. And<br/>\nthen there are some who need to be informed that a certain thing needs to be done. They<br/>\ncan then decide to do it or not, after informing whether they will or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow the real informing part is &quot;Inform whoever is going to be impacted by the action that<br/>\nyou are going to take a certain action (and when - not why)&quot; They may like your decision<br/>\nor not, that is not your issue. People who have this energetic design have a steamroller<br/>\naura and informing softens the impact they have on the people around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\n<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 5450<br/>\n(20100914) __________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n__________ Information from ESET NOD32 Antivirus, version of virus signature database 5450<br/>\n(20100914) __________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe message was checked by ESET NOD32 Antivirus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eset.com\">http://www.eset.com</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] dealing with my own anger","postDate":"1284477890","msgId":44759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUyMTEyMi44Mzc3NC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2bnVnbis1dnVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44757,"nextInTopic":44760,"prevInTime":44758,"nextInTime":44760,"topicId":44757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello Cathy, It looks like you were describing me sometimes!

Wow! I am very loving with my toddler, really loving but sometimes he pushes my buttons and makes me feel really angry....just like you described. I try hard not to get mad.....And I do give him freedom but sometimes ay ay ay...Example, I am taking him for a walk in his bugaboo along with my 2 chihuahuas. we are going uphill the he decides to pull the shade off...It is so hard to fix it...on top of it I had to hold the leashes and when I try to put it back he keeps pulling it again....so I blew up like a mad bomb...I got in the ring with him....So what I am going to do now it is to remove the cause of that anger, I will pull the shade out and leave it home....This way there is nothing that would get me mad when we walk..I&#39;ll try put it back in the near future.<br/>\nI read a book that says that children often push your buttons to get you into the ring. Once they get you there you guys fight, right? so what it suggests is to go around the ring and get to your child from a calm and loving point. <br/>\nI am trying to do what the book &quot;1,2,3 Toddler years suggests&quot;. It try to give him 2 choices...Do you want to get into the car seat by yourself or want mommy to seat you...Do you want to put the red shirt or the blue one...It would work better with your daughter since she is older. It gives them a sense of power and you got what you wanted: get her into the car seat or putting the shirt on.<br/>\nAs far as dealing with anger I haven&#39;t figured out yet...I keep telling myself If it is that the way I want my son to behave when he is mad or frustrated....I don&#39;t so I hope at some point I change that...I want to be a perfect mom...I pray for more patience....<br/>\nGood luck! <br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 9/14/10, cathy_jerad_adela &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:livinglovingchrist@...\">livinglovingchrist@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: cathy_jerad_adela &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:livinglovingchrist@...\">livinglovingchrist@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] dealing with my own anger<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, September 14, 2010, 6:49 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      We&#39;ve been deschooling for several months with our now-3 y.o. dd, and we&#39;ve come a long way towards unschooling (sleep, food, learning, behaviour, ...). But I&#39;m struggling to deal with my own anger. Every other day, it seems, I&#39;ll get upset by something and get angry. My angry emotion comes very quicky and intensely. Mainly it comes out in demanding my own way and sometimes condemning her for what she&#39;s been doing. I&#39;m like a toddler having a hissy fit and (almost) stomping because I want my own way. I hope I&#39;m giving a clear enough description. I think it&#39;s pretty harmful though not full-on verbal abuse, just to clarify. Her reaction is mainly to be a bit shocked, quiet, and pursue me and give me cuddles and say she loves me.

No matter how much healing I&#39;ve had over the years, I&#39;ve got this real impatience and intolerance, and this intense quick reaction.
