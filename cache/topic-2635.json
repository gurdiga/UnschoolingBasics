So she has real problems translating that to sitting action.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am mulling all this over and perhaps coming up with some ideas just from<br/>\nall the good suggestion put out there by everyone here.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nToday when we got home she said she had to go, so I said, lets try on the<br/>\ntoilet and she made a face, and I immediately said if it doesn&#39;t work then<br/>\nwe can put on a pull up right away. She smiled with relief and said yes and<br/>\nas she went into the toilet I got the pull up. She made what looked like a<br/>\ncouple of pushing efforts then said no and we put on the pull up and she<br/>\nwent there. I told her she was brave to try and that if we tried like that<br/>\neach day then one day it would work. And she said &quot;I am so excited to poo in<br/>\nthe toilet!&quot; which was just such an amazing thing to hear. So maybe we are<br/>\ngetting somewhere.

I love this book!  Mostly, though, not for the potty so much <br/>\nas it shows AP things, a baby nursing, a baby in bed with its mama, a <br/>\nbaby in cloth diapers, they showed a co-sleeper.  It&#39;s cute, it takes <br/>\nthe angle that when you were a baby, you needed lots of help from your <br/>\nparents (nursing, going to sleep, changing your diaper), but now you&#39;re <br/>\ngetting older, you can do more things yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 3 and a few months, and has been back and forth in <br/>\ndiapers and potty for a while now, more than six months I think.  At one <br/>\npoint she had been using the potty for pee and poop all day, only having <br/>\na diaper at night and sometimes when we went out, for two whole months. <br/>\n  This prompted me to believe she was nearly &quot;trained&quot; and I gave away <br/>\nalmost all my cloth diapers.  Oops.  Now, she wears a diaper more than <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t, she pees in the potty maybe once a day, and she pooped in <br/>\nit one day last week, but mostly she&#39;s asking for a diaper when she has <br/>\nto go.

But that is wearing me  thin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I read your post I knew you were going to get to the holding the BM&#39;s  <br/>\npart.  I could see it coming.  That can be really serious and it&#39;s  good that <br/>\nshe&#39;ll use the pull-up instead of that.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wonder, if she is usually standing when she uses the pull-up?  Maybe  <br/>\nthat&#39;s why she can&#39;t seem to &quot;understand the process&quot; when she sits.  I&#39;m  thinking <br/>\nit might be worth a try to let her stand on the seat until she has  success.  <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t rush this idea, though.  I&#39;d observe for several  days and see if <br/>\nshe is standing during the actual act, and then in a happy way  at a relaxed <br/>\ntime, maybe even while she&#39;s doing it, suggest she could stand up  on the <br/>\ntoilet, instead.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd what about a potty chair?  No water in it, just an empty pot  that&#39;s <br/>\navailable when she needs it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd what about a special event coming up where she would be required to  (not <br/>\nby you, but by the circumstances of the event) be able to use the  potty?  <br/>\nVacation bible school, or a Little Farmers class at the zoo or  something that <br/>\nwould really interest her?  I&#39;d make it months away, and I  wouldn&#39;t bring up <br/>\nthe potty issue right away.  I might mention that the  kids there won&#39;t be able <br/>\nto use pull-ups, and express confidence that she won&#39;t  be using pull-ups for <br/>\nthe rest of her life.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat brings up an important thing, too.  It&#39;s already obvious she&#39;s  <br/>\nmotivated by being older--her 3rd birthday goal, for instance.  I would  really try to <br/>\ncreate a vision for her older years and share it with her.   Kids love to <br/>\nhear about themselves.  Have a little conversation when you  each share what her <br/>\nfuture will be like.  You have to put it in perspective  for a 4 yo...start <br/>\nwith what it&#39;s like to be 5, about losing teeth and things  like that.  Riding <br/>\nbig bikes, or going down the water slide by herself when  she&#39;s 7 or whatever.  <br/>\nHow some day some of the things she likes to play  with now will not be so <br/>\nmuch fun, but will be replaced with something else new  and different.  It <br/>\nreally helps if she has older siblings or close cousins  who demonstrate these new <br/>\nand different things for her.  It&#39;s important to  help her see this is a <br/>\nproblem for not just her, and then enlist her help.   Don&#39;t see her as adversary in <br/>\nthis issue, but foster the idea that you&#39;re  partners who help each other.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt would help YOU to remember that she won&#39;t always be wearing pull-ups,  <br/>\ntoo.  I personally would put the clean-up part under health and  safety, and <br/>\ncoerce her into letting me clean her up.  I wouldn&#39;t wrestle  her to the ground or <br/>\nanything, but I would make fun things a little difficult  until I could get <br/>\nher to submit.  Maybe save her bath until after her daily  pull-up, and make <br/>\nbath time really fun?<br/>\n <br/>\nIt won&#39;t last forever.  A useful mantra for much of parenting.   ;)<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":112200200,"authorName":"Carrol","from":"&quot;Carrol&quot; &lt;rtillmansmail@...&gt;","profile":"rtillmansmail","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: thoughts and suggestions needed","postDate":"1092054899","msgId":2654,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmN3IxaiszY2JkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwODA5LjA1NDc1MC4yODAuMC5kZHppbWxld0BqdW5vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":2652,"nextInTopic":2656,"prevInTime":2653,"nextInTime":2655,"topicId":2635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would seriously give this a try!<br/>\n<br/>\nA few other thoughts if you think she is still afraind of getting <br/>\ndirty or scared of germs.<br/>\n1-give her gloves to wear. <br/>\n2-Place a loud bell that she can ring in case you&#39;re not there so you <br/>\ncan come running to help.<br/>\n3-discuss good hand washing technique. Give her a special soap or <br/>\nsaop dispenser and a very soft nail brush. Make sure she can <br/>\ncomfortably reach the sink. You could let her paint her own wooeden <br/>\nstep or put stickers on a plastic one. Give her special hand towels. <br/>\nJust as important, let her know that a minimum amount of time is <br/>\nsufficient or she may become compulsive and end up with dry, cracked <br/>\nhands.

Then he could switch back if he wanted.

Carry them with you and if you get in that<br/>\nsituation, explain and pull one out?  Or talk and agree that after a certain<br/>\nperiod of time on the potty (like 15 min) on the road, she goes to a pullup<br/>\nif she&#39;s still not done?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then changing her is a challenge. She seems to have an affinity to doing it<br/>\nat home, so if<br/>\nwe are out for the day, she mostly doesn&#39;t need to until we get home, but it<br/>\ndoes sometimes happen still. Very challenging.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is a challenge.  I have diaper changing challenges on a daily basis<br/>\nwith my 3 1/2 yr old son.  The pee pee stuff I let go until the point of<br/>\ndiaper disintigration usually - I do find it&#39;s easier to do it when he&#39;s<br/>\ndistracted, like watching a video.  With the poops, I explain that it&#39;s<br/>\nimportant to get them changed in a timely way because it can give him diaper<br/>\nrash - make his bum read and ouchie - if we don&#39;t and also because if he&#39;s<br/>\ngot poop and pee in there together and the diaper disintigrates it&#39;s a<br/>\nhealth issue for all of us.  Sometimes if he&#39;s really having trouble and my<br/>\ndh is around my son agrees to have dh change him while he is nursing with<br/>\nme.  Sometimes just doing it in a new place in the house seems exciting<br/>\nenough to get him to do it.  I haven&#39;t had the problem with being out, but<br/>\nperhaps if you explained that if it&#39;s poop it&#39;s important enough to<br/>\ninterrupt her good time to go home to change it - would that give her<br/>\nincentive?  Or do you think there&#39;s fear involved?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I liked your idea of the story, I have been getting more and more into tell<br/>\nher a bedtime story that is in fact our day back to her, she really likes<br/>\nit. I also use story&#39;s to tell her more about what it will be like when the<br/>\nbaby comes etc. As I was reading your suggestion, my first thought WOW good<br/>\nidea, and then as you moved through it I wondered if it might actually<br/>\nencourage her to put her fingers in it and play with it more. so might have<br/>\nto modify that a bit. I have a friend who&#39;s son smears it everywhere. and<br/>\nthat is something I just don&#39;t think I could handle at all. Not to mention<br/>\nmy dh.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, good point.  I guess you need something that&#39;s fun if under control<br/>\nbut not so fun if it&#39;s not.  How about the water hose?  Not so fun if you<br/>\nget sprayed inadvertantly and soaked (which had made my son cry), but fun to<br/>\nplay with once you get it under control with practice?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;When you say it took a long time with your daughter. how old was she when<br/>\nstarted going in the toilet?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a one word, one sentence or even one short paragraph answer.  It<br/>\nsent me back through the journal I keep for my daughter to check cause I<br/>\nhonestly can&#39;t remember all the ups and downs!  It was far from a linear<br/>\nexperience, that&#39;s for sure.  I want to first share the following entry with<br/>\nyou since it&#39;s pretty funny.  When my dd was 2.10 I wrote &quot;I think you may<br/>\nnever potty train.  You think being able to pee and poop while you play is<br/>\nso great that you tell me to get mommy sized diapers so I don&#39;t have to stop<br/>\nplaying either to perform these bodily functions.  You can&#39;t imagine why<br/>\neveryone wouldn&#39;t want to use diapers - it&#39;s so convenient.  This morning<br/>\nyou realized you couldn&#39;t sit to play with your airplane set and poop at the<br/>\nsame time so you said &quot;Momma, we need a table for my airplane set so I can<br/>\npoop and play at the same time!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen she peed in the potty for the first time two weeks after I wrote this.<br/>\nGo figure.  Then she lost interest for 7 months.  She decided she was &quot;tired<br/>\nof wearing diapers&quot; (for peeing) one day when she was 3.5.  Only problem was<br/>\nshe got really attached to that one pair of underwear she started out in and<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t wear any of the other pairs, not even for me to wash the one she<br/>\nloved.  She first pooped in a toilet 6 months later when she was 3.11.  It<br/>\nwas not at our house and she talked about it in the third person (which is<br/>\nhow she used to handle difficult emotions of hers).  I wrote in her journal<br/>\nthat she declared she pooped &quot;because there are no diapers here Mama so Suji<br/>\n(her name for herself at that time after a cat we had who died when she was<br/>\n2) just pooped.&quot;  But two months later at 4.1 she was back in diapers for<br/>\npooping because the whole potty thing had lost it&#39;s appeal and she was<br/>\npeeing in her underwear, happily changing it, and asking for a diaper only<br/>\nwhen she needed to poop.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve searched my journal for a time when I wrote we crossed the bridge into<br/>\npeeing and pooping in the potty regularly and I can&#39;t find it.  Probably<br/>\ncause it didn&#39;t happen one day all of a sudden.  My memory is that this was<br/>\nsomething that happened gradually over a period of time - probably between<br/>\n4.5 and 5 yrs old.  Can&#39;t be much after 5 since she&#39;d 5.9 and I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember the &quot;old days&quot; anymore.  So all in all, from her first peeing till<br/>\nshe was peeing and pooping without much incident, we&#39;re talking two years<br/>\n(2.10 to probably about 4.10).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so challenging and I didn&#39;t always find &quot;the answer&quot;, but I&#39;m so glad<br/>\nI honored her need for her own timetable enough that she was able to find<br/>\nher way.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35875473,"authorName":"heather mclean","from":"heather mclean &lt;heather@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] thoughts and suggestions needed","postDate":"1092011118","msgId":2643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwODA5MDAyNTE4LjI3MTc1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQwNzA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBJMjUwMDkwU0o4VVlSQGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":2642,"nextInTopic":2645,"prevInTime":2642,"nextInTime":2644,"topicId":2635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sherri-Lee, Maybe she d like the book Everyone Poops (My Body Science) by Taro Gomi.

I am completely sure it would not. Today when I was sleeping she<br/>\njust put on the pull up herself, so that is good too. The problem comes if<br/>\nwe are out and about. Driving in the van, she says she has to go, ok if we<br/>\nhave a pull up with us, then we have to pull over put one on and sit on the<br/>\nside of the road for 30 mins? 60 mins? Not always possible. Then changing<br/>\nher is a challenge. She seems to have an affinity to doing it at home, so if<br/>\nwe are out for the day, she mostly doesn&#39;t need to until we get home, but it<br/>\ndoes sometimes happen still. Very challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t ask her every time she has to go if she wants to try in the toilet,<br/>\njust occasionally. To be honest, I don&#39;t even remember all the time. But<br/>\nwhen I do, she says no. I say ok and that is it. She doesn&#39;t show any<br/>\noutward sign of distress.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI liked your idea of the story, I have been getting more and more into tell<br/>\nher a bedtime story that is in fact our day back to her, she really likes<br/>\nit. I also use story&#39;s to tell her more about what it will be like when the<br/>\nbaby comes etc. As I was reading your suggestion, my first thought WOW good<br/>\nidea, and then as you moved through it I wondered if it might actually<br/>\nencourage her to put her fingers in it and play with it more. so might have<br/>\nto modify that a bit. I have a friend who&#39;s son smears it everywhere. and<br/>\nthat is something I just don&#39;t think I could handle at all. Not to mention<br/>\nmy dh.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wondered if the night time thing was about her being not tired. One night<br/>\nI told her the TV was going to go off whether she poo&#39;d or not. she didn&#39;t<br/>\npoo and had no resistance. Another night I told her she could watch the<br/>\nshows we had agreed on whether she poo&#39;d or not and she didn&#39;t poo and<br/>\nwatched her shows. I have struggled with the night time thing for sure. This<br/>\nis not something we can let go of yet. She will sit up all night watching TV<br/>\nno matter how tired she is and we have a cascade of issues that comes from<br/>\nthat. What I noticed though is if I stick to and the TV goes off. she is<br/>\nasleep within 5 minutes. So she is tired if she can fall asleep that easily.<br/>\nShe never is awake for long after we turn off the light and snuggle down.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say it took a long time with your daughter. how old was she when<br/>\nstarted going in the toilet?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have only had a couple of time when she didn&#39;t want to stop what she was<br/>\ndoing to go pee in the toilet, her 4th birthday party being one of them. She<br/>\nis now getting frustrated with wearing a diaper at night so I am back to<br/>\nchanging her in the middle of the night after a year or more not having to<br/>\ndo that, but it irritates her so I do it. That will be fun with the new babe<br/>\nin the fall. I have told her when she wakes up with a dry diaper for more<br/>\nmornings than not then she can sleep without one. And he diaper is mostly<br/>\nsoaked in the morning so we are a ways from that too. which is ok with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts, I appreciate it, good to hear someone else is/was<br/>\nin the same boat if nothing else.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-lee<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Joan Labbe & Salvatore Genovese [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:salgenovese@...\">salgenovese@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, August 08, 2004 4:15 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] thoughts and suggestions needed<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHey, Sherri,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to offer some support and a few ideas.  I think the way you<br/>\nhave handled things is fabulous.  Firstly, it&#39;s not that unusual for kids to<br/>\nfear pooping in the potty.  My daughter, who also did the potty thing<br/>\nentirely on her own timetable, peed forever before pooping too.  It sounds<br/>\nlike you have an additional fear cropping up from her experience getting<br/>\ncovered in poop too, and I think you are entirely right not to push her.  It<br/>\ncould be too that your asking her every time if she wants to go feels like<br/>\npressure to her too (I know it would to my daughter), so you might want to<br/>\nconsider dropping that, since it is my feeling that she&#39;ll come to it in her<br/>\nown time better with less pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy opinion is that your dh&#39;s idea of refusing to do diapers would just make<br/>\nthe situation worse - perhaps cause her to start holding her poop again.  I<br/>\nurge you not to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few ideas - the straightforward approach: Sometime that is in no<br/>\nway related to going to the bathroom and when everything is calm and going<br/>\nwell, mention that you are wondering if she still feels scared about that<br/>\nprior potty experience.  Ask her if it would help if she had an alternate<br/>\nway of checking what&#39;s going on without having to reach down there.  Maybe a<br/>\nsmall mirror?  I would put on no pressure, just a suggestion and see if she<br/>\nhas any interest in discussing it.  If not, I&#39;d drop it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother more indirect idea is that my daughter had lots of fears that were<br/>\nhelped (when she was ready of course) by storytelling.  Maybe a similar<br/>\nstory would be a story of a little animal (pick your daughter&#39;s favorite)<br/>\nthat fell in a mud puddle one day, got covered in mud, and felt scared by<br/>\nthat.  It was so helpful to my daughter to have her feelings reflected, so<br/>\nI&#39;d go heavy on how the little animal felt seeing the mud suddenly all over<br/>\nhim, but not in a scary way of course.  Just to reflect her feelings back.<br/>\nSo the animal avoids the mud at all costs (you can maybe come up with some<br/>\nfunny ways the animal avoids the mud - builds bridges etc...) then one day<br/>\nsees some of her friends playing in the mud, goes over, the friends tell her<br/>\nabout how much fun it is when you do it the way you like, and she decides to<br/>\ntry it when it&#39;s not such a surprise and is glad she did.....Or maybe you<br/>\ncan come up with something that represents her dilemna better.  If at any<br/>\npoint the story seems distressing to her, I&#39;d stop.  I&#39;d take it as an<br/>\nindication she&#39;s not ready to think about this even in the abstract right<br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure about the nighttime thing - is it a &quot;bedtime&quot; issue?  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nto say if that&#39;s related to her pooping or if she&#39;s letting you know she&#39;s<br/>\nnot tired and ready to go to bed.  Maybe someone else will have a good idea<br/>\nabout that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.  I can tell you that it was to my great surprise that letting<br/>\nmy daughter potty train in her own time did *not* make it the easy<br/>\ntransition I expected.  Not only did it take forever for her to decide to<br/>\npoop in there, once she got past the interesting novelty of peeing in the<br/>\npotty and wanting to pee in every different one in every different place, it<br/>\njust became boring and mundane and not worth interrupting anything over.  We<br/>\nwent through a period where she didn&#39;t want to go back to diapers, but she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to interrupt anything she was doing to go to the bathroom.<br/>\nShe&#39;d just pee where she was and cheerily help me clean it up.

I am at a loss:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo dd (Hannah) is almost 4.5. When she turned 3, she said she was going<br/>\nstart peeing in the toilet, fine, great! No pressure from us, just a<br/>\ndeadline set by her (her birthday) and then it was done. I thought this was<br/>\ngreat. So then one day she was in the bathroom and all of a sudden she was<br/>\nscreaming and crying, so I went running and there she was trying to poo in<br/>\nthe toilet, and had put her hand back to help her look at what was going on<br/>\nand had gotten her hand covered in it. then all over herself. She was very<br/>\nupset obviously, I was calm and just tried to soothe her and cleaned her up<br/>\nand reassured her and we moved on. It was never mentioned again. However,<br/>\nsince that day she will absolutely NOT even try to poo in the toilet again.<br/>\nSo here we are at 4.5 and she goes and gets a pull up and asks me to help<br/>\nher put it on and then I clean it and put on her panties again when she is<br/>\ndone. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor awhile my husband and his sister were trying to be helpful to get her to<br/>\ngo in the toilet, in their own peculiar way and would comment on how stinky<br/>\nshe was with poo in her diaper, my SIL wouldn&#39;t help with the diaper is she<br/>\nwas babysitting etc. all very negative, and what resulted from that was<br/>\nHannah holding her BM&#39;s for days until she was constipated and in pain. I<br/>\ntold both my dh and my SIL that they were to stop and not say another word<br/>\nagain about it, that she would go in the toilet when she was ready just as<br/>\nshe did with pee.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am trying to be patient, but man I wouldn&#39;t mind if she went in the<br/>\ntoilet. When she comes to me with a pull up I ask her if she would like to<br/>\ntry in the toilet, sometimes (rarely) she says yes and we go but nothing<br/>\nhappens, she just can&#39;t seem to figure out the process. Most of the time she<br/>\nsays no. And I just say ok and leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThese days though what is happening is that she will put on a pull up and<br/>\nthen won&#39;t let me change her for hours! So we are living in a house that<br/>\nsmells like poo for a couple of hours a day. Most unpleasant for us all<br/>\nexcept her it seems. I try to ask her to stay in her play room and not get<br/>\ntoo close because the smell is unpleasant but she doesn&#39;t get it and<br/>\ncontinues to come to hug me with the dirty diaper on. By the time she agrees<br/>\nto having it changed (and the only way she agrees is if I just say I am<br/>\ngetting the wash cloth now. if I ask she will always say no) it is dried and<br/>\nstuck on her bum. Not a fun job. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing is she will often say she needs to go just as we are about<br/>\nto crawl into bed and then will take anywhere from 30-60 minutes before she<br/>\nsays she is done. Personally I think this time is a time stalling issue<br/>\nabout going to bed. And through talking about it and being open to her<br/>\nneeds, we have lessened the frequency of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I just don&#39;t know what to do. I wouldn&#39;t mind her continuing to go in a<br/>\ndiaper until she was ready, IF she didn&#39;t insist on having her dirty diaper<br/>\non for an hour or two after being done. But that is wearing me thin.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am trying to be respectful of her wants and needs but I really feel<br/>\nthat it is beyond reasonable to ask my dh and I to have the smell of poo in<br/>\nour home for this long each day. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nANY thoughts? And sorry for too much info, I have no one else to ask, dh<br/>\nsays just refuse to do diapers any more. and my other family would take a<br/>\nharsher approach believe me, not having any respect for children.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2620,"nextTopicId":2666}}
