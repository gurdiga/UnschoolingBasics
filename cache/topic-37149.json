I let my children breast feed until they decided to stop both were right around two. I felt more bereft than anything when they wanted to stop. Now I did pump some as well because my husband wanted to be able to feed them as well, it was one of those moments he has always treasured with the kids and they have all built a very strong relationship as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are healthy children and yes they do still find comfort in snuggling up to mommy&#39;s breasts, it is one way that I know if something is bothering them and that they may need to talk about it. My son is only 4 and when he is frightened, not feeling well or something along those lines, he crawls up into my lap and slides his hand down the front of my shirt. He isn&#39;t groping or anything like that but he says he feels better or safe when he does it and that mommy is very very soft the way she is supposed to be. Typically he goes for the left side, heart side, probably still a very comforting feel and sound for him is my heart beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really wish both of mine had gone on longer I think I enjoyed the comfort as much as they did. But I think allowing your children to decide when to stop is the best for them, hard for mommy but good for the children. Stopping by a certain age and handing them a sippy cup or bottle or whatever is a societal constraint in most cases. We actually changed pediatricians with our first because the original one wasn&#39;t supportive of our decision to co-sleep (now that we know that is what we had been doing), to question vaccinations, things of that nature. I wish we could have put him in our back pocket when we moved. We are still searching for a decent pediatrician in this area for those just in case moments, though typically neither one ever gets very sick and are otherwise very healthy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than my husband  being supportive of long term nursing my mom was the only other one who did. Everyone else thought I was absolutely nuts for allowing them to go past 6-12 mths of breast feeding. <br/>\n<br/>\nWell this tired momma is going to head to bed, the kids want to do decorations and such in the morning which means they will be up before the sun to get ready for it  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla B.","from":"&quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: long-term breastfeeding","postDate":"1228703572","msgId":37161,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdoaTEways3b3QzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwZjQ2MjY3MDgxMjA2MTUyNmk2ODgzMDVhYXkxZTVhZDJlYWM1NzU3OTliQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37160,"nextInTopic":37165,"prevInTime":37160,"nextInTime":37162,"topicId":37149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Sharon, I just wanted to include a couple of quotes from Kathy Detwyller s webpage below: In conclusion, there is no research to support a claim that ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1937438073\">Hey Sharon,<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to include a couple of quotes from Kathy Detwyller&#39;s<br/>\nwebpage below:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In conclusion, there is no research to support a claim that<br/>\nbreastfeeding a child at any age is in any way harmful to a child .

Children who nurse<br/>\nfor more than a year or two tend to regard their mother&#39;s breasts as<br/>\nsources of love and nurturance and comfort, and are more or less<br/>\nimmune to the broader society&#39;s attempts to culturally define breasts<br/>\nas sex objects.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In brief, during the late 1990s, I surveyed 1,280 children in the US<br/>\nwho breastfed for a minimum of three years.
