Two things have helped with Morgan. One is to make sure she has something to take with her if we&#39;re going out, something she can bury her head in so she doesn&#39;t have to interact until and unless she decides she&#39;s ready. A laptop or hand-held game work well for that, but sometimes bringing legos or a project she can do in the car works also - it kind of depends on the weather and circumstances! Using the car or some other location as a &quot;safe space&quot; has also been enormously helpful, since people do try to &quot;draw her out&quot; periodically even if she&#39;s obviously busy playing a game or reading. I try to gently deflect people when I can, but sometimes they slip by me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to keep in mind that after socializing Mo is going to need a period of time to &quot;nest&quot; and turn inward. For awhile that meant we only went out one day a week at most - my stepson is a strong introvert, so when he was home a lot Mo would go weeks of not wanting to socialize with Anyone else, since she was getting more than enough human contact at home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have also learned that there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with introvert, it is actually a personality, just like everyone has they&#39;re own personality, like some kids just love to be around other kids, introverts are so much more happier with 1 good friend or maybe 2.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different ways of defining/conceptualizing introversion and extroversion. One idea is that extroverts &quot;charge their emotional batteries&quot; by socializing while introverts do that in solitude. That means someone can be fairly social but also an introvert - which is true of my partner. He&#39;s a pretty social guy, but he needs a certain amount of solitude to recoup. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother conceptualization is that some people learn best about social situations by getting into the middle of them and interacting, while others are wired to observe before interacting. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen with Mo and with myself, too. That&#39;s sort of the classic &quot;shy&quot; or &quot;slow to warm&quot; person. Someone who is an observant learner, socially, won&#39;t learn social skills as quickly if he is pushed into interacting before he&#39;s had time to observe - hence the stereotype of the shy maladroit person. I know I was pushed by my parents and by school to interact before I was ready most of the time, so I didn&#39;t learn very much about social interactions until I was an adult. Darn that &quot;socialization!&quot; ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking sure Mo had a place to go and rest (or avoid people entirely) And that she had a kind of &quot;tool&quot; like a game or movie has helped her be in charge of deciding when to observe and when to interact. She can watch people openly, knowing I&#39;ll divert people if she needs me to do that, or she can watch people surreptitiously so they don&#39;t notice her until she&#39;s ready to join in - or not!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, even though she is very much an introvert and also easily described as &quot;shy&quot; she has several friends and is able to choose to do very social things. Recently she attended a two-day birthday party culminating in a trip to play laser-tag and had a blast, despite knowing few of the kids at the party and being surrounded by strange adults playing tag. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Introverted son","postDate":"1316108084","msgId":47276,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0dGN2aythZXVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0cnNmaitpN211QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47275,"nextInTopic":47278,"prevInTime":47275,"nextInTime":47277,"topicId":47269,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a view -- get out and do things you enjoy and leave him home in peace and quiet.
