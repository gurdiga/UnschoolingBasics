Haven&#39;t heard ours sing - they&#39;re mostly busy<br/>\nrearranging the gravel in the bottom of the tank to suit themselves (so<br/>\nare the snails for that matter). How do you hear them when they&#39;re<br/>\nunderwater?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve decided that Banana, the yellow shelled snail, is a Xtreme games<br/>\ntypes snail. It (I always want to call Banana &quot;she&quot; and Blueberry &quot;he&quot;)<br/>\nclimbed itself to the top of the tank wall, right to the water line,<br/>\nthen wiggled loose and floated down to the floor of the tank, landed<br/>\nright side up and started crawling away. It&#39;s a very active snail (and<br/>\npretty fast as snails go). It&#39;s really amazing to watch as it climbs up<br/>\nthe plants then extends the gastropod and transfers to the wall of the<br/>\ntank without a slip or hitch. Wow! Blueberry is more &#39;traditional&#39;, slow<br/>\nmoving, generally less active.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

We bought 1, just<br/>\none, dalmatian molly around Jan 2007. We have now had at least 3 broods,<br/>\naveraging 5 to 6 mollies per brood. That&#39;s why we have two tanks - two<br/>\nweeks after we brought her home, we noticed these little &quot;things&quot;<br/>\nswimming around in the tank - baby mollies! To many (what with the other<br/>\nfish we had in there) for the tank to be healthy so we got another tank,<br/>\ngot it going, transferred  momma and several other fish to that tank.<br/>\nTank two eventually died off bit by bit and we cleaned it all out (right<br/>\ndown to washing the plastic plants and gravel) and waited a bit before<br/>\nre-setting it last weekend. Within the last two weeks, the momma has<br/>\nhad, as best we can tell by their sizes, two broods. Mollies are<br/>\ninteresting in that not only are they live breeders but the female, once<br/>\nfertilized, can decide WHEN to have the babies. If she feels stressed in<br/>\nany way (aggressive fish pestering her, overcrowding, too warm/cool, pH<br/>\nor ammonia levels not to her liking) she can choose to not have any and<br/>\ncan wait for up to something like 6 months before popping those little<br/>\nones out, all at once or in small batches. Guess she likes us LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re thinking of the Aussie rainbow fish and maybe some gouramis -<br/>\nwe&#39;re trying to balance the colors, sizes, and preferred &#39;living spaces&#39;<br/>\n(some prefer the bottom third of the tank others the midsection and<br/>\nothers swim nearer the top) so that they&#39;re not all bumping into each<br/>\nother in the bottom half of the tank. We don&#39;t want any live bearers<br/>\nanymore and we&#39;re trying to get away from the black & white &#39;theme&#39; of<br/>\nthe tank full of mollies.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
