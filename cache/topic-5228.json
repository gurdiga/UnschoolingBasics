What are textbooks?  My kids&#39; textbooks are the books <br/>\nthat they want to read.

I highly recommend The Unschooling Handbook (OK, <br/>\nI&#39;m biased, one of my friends is one of the families in that book <br/>\nLOL!) and anything from John Holt (especially his later works).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI never announced to my kids that we were going to &quot;unschool.&quot;  I <br/>\njust started letting go of my control issues and allowed them to <br/>\nlive.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We live in Gainesville, FL and have a 10 YO Girl and a 5 YO Boy<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know that there are some active groups in central Florida.  I <br/>\nthink there is even an inclusive home/unschooling group in your <br/>\narea.  I&#39;m taxing my brain to remember what it is.
