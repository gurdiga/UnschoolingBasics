Stress isn&#39;t good for digestion, it isn&#39;t good for the immunes system, it&#39;s hard on the heart and nervous system - its hard on bodies in general. That&#39;s pretty well established, not something we have to guess at.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have the advantage (such as it is) of remembering just How stressful it is to be the kid who doesn&#39;t want to eat what and how much adults would like. It was huge! It was the recurrent drama of my days - please eat, just one more bite, no, not until you eat. I remember sitting and looking at plates full of grotesque junk, bracing myself for the moment I&#39;d have to choke it down. I&#39;m not saying that to make anyone feel guilty, but in hopes that it will help someone have a little perspective on the child&#39;s side of things - its not one bit easier to Be the child who doesn&#39;t want to eat in those circumstances. The stress is excruciating. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to consider with health issues in general is that little imbalances can throw off the sense of taste too, making foods with complex flavors less palatable, and simple tastes (sweet for instance, or salt) more appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling food","postDate":"1269773300","msgId":43526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUzNDI4NC42MTk4NS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhvbTUzbytiYTJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhvbTUzbytiYTJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43525,"nextInTopic":43530,"prevInTime":43525,"nextInTime":43527,"topicId":43524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just talked to David about this and he said not getting enough calories is going to negatively impact her immune system as well, so better to encourage her to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-681862488\">Just talked to David about this and he said not getting enough calories is going to negatively impact her immune system as well, so better to encourage her to eat the things she wants than to have two things working against her immune system. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend has one daughter, who will be 6 in May.

Brain development takes more sugar and fats than it takes fibre, it&#39;s very energetically expensive, and energy that is quickly accessible, that doesn&#39;t take energy to extract, is most useful. Maintaining an adult body is very different from growing into one and the nutrient requirements needed to support that growth are very different as well. It might help to think about any pre-menstrual cravings, or pregnancy cravings a woman has. I crave red  meat and chocolate sometimes when I&#39;m pre-menstrual and when I was pregnant, my cravings for things like liver were huge, I wanted iron. Some women even go so far as eating laundry detergent or soil their cravings for minerals are so great. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a discussion here about research on food. It starts around <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/42176.\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/42176.</a> But among the early links is one to work by LeAnn Birch that was on Scientific American Frontiers: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNA3zltptmk&feature=player_embedded,\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNA3zltptmk&feature=player_embedded,</a> a video that really is very cool at examining the ways in which parents can screw up their children&#39;s relationship to food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOver at Always Learning there is a really nice post about food: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/48290,\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/48290,</a> I&#39;m gonna quote from it briefly, but it&#39;s worth going and reading the whole thing, particularly given the nature of your friend&#39;s situations: <br/>\n<br/>\nI can ony speak for my own children, and my eldest is only ten, but in <br/>\nmy<br/>\nexperience children eat different things according to their growth <br/>\ncycle: at<br/>\ntimes they will eat vast amounts of carbs, put on a lot of weight, then<br/>\nsuddenly shoot up - at which point they&#39;ll eat more protein. that<br/>\nobservation really helped me trust that they know far better than I what<br/>\nthey need to eat. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren Swanay wrote a post about her recovery from controlling her children&#39;s food intake and how it played out in their lives. It has An Anorexic&#39;s Creed at the end which is very powerful if a bit fear-mongering. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/41340.\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/41340.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to search through the yahoo groups at the moment because they don&#39;t do anything more recent than some cut off date.
