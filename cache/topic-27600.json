I have been unschooling my four boys aged 8 1/2, 7, 4 and 1 1/2 more or less since the end of the last school year.  (My 8 1/2 year old left school a few months before the end of the second grade - the two middle kids finished the school year in pre-school). I owe it all to my oldest, who never adapted himself to the school environment.  When he was three, I got a call from the head of the nursery (a Montessori nursery, no less) that she was very concerned about my son.  I came in and she proceeded to tell me that she said &quot;Good morning, Yonah&quot; and he replied &quot;I&#39;m not Yonah, I&#39;m a parrot.&quot; I smiled and waited for her to tell me the part that concerned her.  That was it.  She said that they believe children should live in reality and not in fantasy and that when he talks about fantasy, I was to say to him, &quot;That is fantasy and we only talk about reality.&quot; She also recommended he be assessed by a &quot;professional&quot;. I thought she was nuts and moved him to a regular pre-school.  In kindergarten, he cried about going, and begged me to take him with me to work, or pick him up in the middle of the day and take him to lunch (which I did as often as I could). One day (at age 5) he said to me &quot;Do you know why I don&#39;t like school?&quot; I said, &quot;No. Why don&#39;t you like school?&quot; He said &quot;Becuase at school I can&#39;t make up the rules.&quot; (Gotta love him.) We moved to Israel in July of 2005, and he began grade 1 here.  I went with him the first two weeks.  After that he started failing to return to class after recess.  He habitually sat with the school guard the whole day until the school bus came to take him home.  The school transferred him to a more experienced teacher and recommended he see a psychologist.  The more experienced teacher &quot;made strides&quot; with him, bribing him with candies to return to class after recess and bribing other students with candies if they assisted in getting him to class after recess.  Yonah took the candies, came to class, but refused to participate and drew in his notebooks until the clock ran out on school and he could return home.  I looked into other schools, particularly &quot;democratic schools&quot; (which are modeled after the Sudbury Valley school), but they were too far away and the commute was too long.  One day a friend of mine asked why I didn&#39;t homeschool.  The picture in my head of homeschooling was this awful picture of me and my son sitting at the kitchen table with tests and me grading his work - Yuch!  My friend told me that most homeschoolers do not do school at home.  Then it hit me, I could do a &quot;democratic school&quot; at home!  I wanted him to finish out the year to make my life easier, (the legalities of homeschooling in Israel are complicated to say the least), but by April, he was refusing to go, getting &quot;sick&quot;, &quot;missing the school bus&quot;, and once went to the trouble of coming back from the bus stop with soiled pants so he would not have to go.  That was the final straw for me and after that I didn&#39;t send him. (That&#39;s when the school recommended that I see a psychologist.)  My second child was determined by the school board in my region to be in need of &quot;special ed&quot; because he was labeled ADHD and hypersensitive. I&#39;ll grant them the sensitive part, but he can focus perfectly well on anything that interests him.  And he has a need to climb. (He says he is a monkey (Sorry honey, but that&#39;s fantasy and we only talk about - oh, have a banana.) I love unschooling!  I can&#39;t imagine a better way to be.  My oldest is exploring the wonderful world of cooking and baking (Help! We&#39;re full!).  Ds (7) came up with a brilliant business idea yesterday that I think is seriously worth pursuing.  My four year old navigates the web like a pro (he has made his own vision video using Windows movie maker), and the baby is thrilled to have his big brothers around.  His latest word? &quot;Guys!&quot;  He walks around the house yelling &quot;Guys!&quot;.  Last week they decided that we should have a picnic in the playground behind our street.  As I lay on the picnic blanket at 11:30 a.m., soaking in the sunshine, watching as my four little guys climbed up the slide, swang on the swing, climbed to the top of the structures and picked pine cones, I thought to myself - &quot;It doesn&#39;t get any better than this!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLove,<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"wisdomalways5","from":"&quot;wisdomalways5&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"wisdomalways5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: was: What&#39;s your unschooling story? - now pet peeve","postDate":"1194908834","msgId":27705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoYW1iMis3c252QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZoYWw4ditvY3RtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27704,"nextInTopic":27708,"prevInTime":27704,"nextInTime":27706,"topicId":27600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They both had kids and were homeschooling, but<br/>\nreally unschooling, I just didn&#39;t know the word for it. <br/>\n <br/>\n I can remember a few distinct times where I cocked my head like the<br/>\nRCA dog at a different idea that I&#39;d never heard of. One was when I<br/>\nwas talking to one of the LLL leaders about meeting a child&#39;s needs<br/>\nand letting go of our assumptions about what that really is and she<br/>\nsaid, &quot;yeah, the other day dd asked to nurse under the kitchen table.&quot;<br/>\nSo I asked,&quot; So what&#39;d you do?&quot; And she goes, &quot;We did.&quot; And that was<br/>\nthe first time I thought, &quot;Huh. I guess there&#39;s really no reason not<br/>\nto meet that need.&quot; And it was so funny because I was all about<br/>\nattachment parenting and meeting my child&#39;s needs, but because my son<br/>\nwas just an infant, my thinking didn&#39;t stretch that far. It&#39;s like I<br/>\nhadn&#39;t thought about meeting a need of my son&#39;s that was sort of<br/>\nwhim-ful in my eyes (to make up a word). That one exchange really<br/>\nopened up my mind as to how I could meet my son&#39;s needs as he grew<br/>\ninto toddlerhood. And I started having memories of my own young life<br/>\nand remembering different times where having my needs met would have<br/>\nmade things so much fricken easier! Not that I hadn&#39;t thought of<br/>\nmeeting needs before, but it was becoming tangible--starting to gel,<br/>\nyou know?<br/>\n <br/>\n Another time I remember cocking my head like the RCA dog is when I<br/>\nstarted looking into these lists, my son was in kindergarten and I<br/>\nhated it, he liked it sometimes, but it just felt so wrong to me. But<br/>\nI remember one post exchange on one of the unschooling lists where I<br/>\nsaid something about the idea of a &quot;sugar bombed kid&quot; or a kid all<br/>\nhyper from being on video games--I was talking about the idea of kids<br/>\ngetting hyper and spazzy when they eat sugar or play video games for<br/>\nmany many hours. I said it like it was really true. And Mary Gold made<br/>\na very casual comment about how she thought it was a myth. Literally,<br/>\nthink all she said was, &quot;I think that&#39;s a myth.&quot; And once again, I was<br/>\nsitting at my computer screen, head cocked, thinking, &quot;Huh. Someone<br/>\nelse thinks that&#39;s a complete myth. Why do I think it&#39;s true? And what<br/>\nwould happen if I didn&#39;t think that?&quot; And since I love being a<br/>\ndiscoverer/scientist in my own life, I decided to do some of the<br/>\nsuggestions I had read and brought my son food&drink while he was<br/>\nplaying and really eased up on sugar (cake for breakfast anyone?) and<br/>\nlo and behold! I did not have a &quot;sugar-bombed&quot; kid and my boy could<br/>\nplay video games for 12 hours and he didn&#39;t get all hyper! And I<br/>\nrealized that *I* can get tired of doing something after many, many<br/>\nhours and it doesn&#39;t mean I need to not do it---why would I limit my<br/>\nknitting or reading because I got tired of it one time? So I stopped<br/>\nlimiting those things with my son&#39;s interests. The food thing is<br/>\nharder because of my own headtrip around food and my partner has his<br/>\nown concerns that add to the issue. But I&#39;m working on it. I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned tons here and other lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, it took me until now to take my boy out of school--he just turned<br/>\n8. My partner (his dad) is moving along this path, but just a little<br/>\nslower than me because he doesn&#39;t read on these lists and elsewhere.<br/>\nBut he&#39;ll listen to principles and logic, and when I explain certain<br/>\nunschooly things in that way, it makes sense to him. The thing now<br/>\nthat I&#39;m realizing is how our society views certain ages and what<br/>\nexpected at those ages. My son is 8 and most of the time there&#39;s a<br/>\nwhole lot of false responsibility and disrespect that people do with<br/>\nyoung people at that age. In my family I want to change that. And what<br/>\nI mean by &quot;false responsibility and disrespect&quot; are things like: not<br/>\ntying shoes when asked, but making the &quot;make your own pizza&quot; because<br/>\n&quot;this is how you do it&quot;. Does that make sense? It&#39;s usually little<br/>\nthings, but I see them as crucial to relationship building or not. <br/>\n<br/>\n So, my family woke up and I want to get off the computer before doing<br/>\nour dump run, but these are my thoughts... :) Thanks for asking the<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n~~Juillet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"&quot;Melissa&quot; &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: What&#39;s your unschooling story?","postDate":"1194731482","msgId":27684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoNTk0cStybnRqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3MDMwOS45NTI5NS5xbUB3ZWI2MDcxOC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":27683,"nextInTopic":27694,"prevInTime":27683,"nextInTime":27685,"topicId":27600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I always wanted to homeschool, and yes, I was one of those annoying teacher-wanna-be.

Dh was <br/>\nentirely against it though, he grew up very rural (think little house on the prairie) and was <br/>\nworried about tada! Socialization. Anyway, when our oldest was five, our second was <br/>\ndiagnosied with severe autism, and we were pressed to put her in special ed preschool. I <br/>\nagreed with everyone when they said that she needed someone trained to deal with special <br/>\nneeds. Since she was going to school, we might as well send the oldest. I was the typical <br/>\nPTA mom, there every day, volunteering everywhere, and my little ones practically grew up <br/>\nin the school. Two years later, my oldest was diagnosed with aspergers, and we struggled <br/>\nto get the individualized program that every kid deserves.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo years later, Emily started preK, and then kindergarten, and Rachel went to preK the <br/>\nyear Emily was in kindie. Sam hit three and we took him to school for the free speech <br/>\ntherapy (he has dysarthria) In that year, we reached the pinnacle of struggles with Josh and <br/>\nBre, and Emily and Rachel both disliked their classes. I figured out that schools and <br/>\nteachers very rarely know how to teach a child with differences, and even more amazing, <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t know how to teach children that were not that different. They knew how to <br/>\nteach classrooms, not children. The kids loved being with friends, but Emily was way <br/>\nahead of what the school would be willing to teach, and Rachel was irritated with how they <br/>\nkept telling her how to do her work ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we pulled them out two weeks before school let out. We started a strict school at home, <br/>\nwhich everyone really loved. It was like a preschool at home. At the end of the summer, <br/>\nhowever, i was put on bedrest with Avari and we did what we could to move the program <br/>\nup to my room. Things started to slide, and we stopped doing anything and to my <br/>\nsurprise, the kids were still learning.

I asked him what HE would like to<br/>\nlearn.  His response, &quot;Anything I don&#39;t already know.&quot;  Then added,<br/>\n&quot;If you find it interesting, I will, too.&quot;  (Smart kid!)  He did want<br/>\nto learn algebra, so with math, we started there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had been learning history sequentially, and somewhere around the<br/>\nRenaissance, he asked, &quot;When we get a chance, can we learn about<br/>\nWWII?&quot;  No time like the present, so we switched gears immediately,<br/>\nwent to the library and got WWII for Dummies.  It was so cool reading<br/>\nthe material and comparing it to Star Trek: Deep Space 9 (in the later<br/>\npart of the series with the Dominion.)  And then, when we got to the<br/>\nBattle of Stalingrad -- he leaped up and said, &quot;That&#39;s exactly how it<br/>\nplays out in the game!&quot;  (His interest was spurred from playing<br/>\nBattlefield 1942 on the computer.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing relaxed in our approach has, imo, been wonderful for him -- so<br/>\nmuch free time to pursue his varied interests.  He crochets (Grandma<br/>\ntaught him that - I don&#39;t crochet!), makes chainmaille, makes (and<br/>\nplays, of course) computer games, and a few other odd and end things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, although it wasn&#39;t something I particularly wanted, we are<br/>\nofficially finishing up homeschooling a year early -- he wants to be a<br/>\nfull-time college student next year.  (I used to joke about holding<br/>\nhim back a year to get more time.)  I know someone who has a son who<br/>\nwould like to do that -- but she and her dh don&#39;t feel he has met all<br/>\nof their requirements to graduate from their homeschool!  I&#39;m merely<br/>\nallowing my ds to follow his interests, which lead him to college. <br/>\nLocally... fortunately, my desire to keep him close to home works out<br/>\nokay.  He told me that the local university fits his needs -- it has<br/>\nthe course work he needs, is close to home, and relatively inexpensive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nReading Gatto and Holt, obviously, are helpful in developing a more<br/>\nrelaxed mindset; at least, they were for me.  Also, Alfie Kohn&#39;s<br/>\nPunished By Rewards was VERY enlightening to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really really really wish I had started homeschooling from the<br/>\nbeginning, though.  We had a lot of damage to work through from<br/>\ntraditional schooling in elementary.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, one of the reasons I didn&#39;t hs at all in the beginning is that I<br/>\nhad this stereotype of religious isolationists... not a group I would<br/>\nfit it with, to say the least!  But the great thing is, now that I hs,<br/>\nI have a widely diverse group of friends!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, had I started out hsing, it would have been MUCH easier to do<br/>\nmore child-led approach than starting later.  My ds was more or less<br/>\nself-propelled on learning -- something that private school hindered<br/>\n(and public school was worse on!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jennifer &lt;beanmommy2@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I thought it would be interesting to hear, if you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; willing to share it, how you got to unschooling,<br/>\n&gt; especially if you used to have children in school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, how did you guys first discover it?

We were away in a whole other state<br/>\nbut MIL called and asked us to help her find out what her options were<br/>\n(parenthetical note, DH&#39;s family order might help: DH is oldest, SIL1 2<br/>\nyrs younger than DH, SIL2 15 yrs younger than DH, SIL3 17 yrs younger<br/>\nthan DH so 2 & 3 were still middle school/high school age when we had<br/>\nalready been married for a couple years). We found that she could easily<br/>\nand legally pull them out of school and &quot;homeschool&quot; - in CT it&#39;s really<br/>\nsimple, a letter of withdrawal and that&#39;s it for paperwork. So, she did.<br/>\nIn the process, however, DH and I got to talking about the idea of<br/>\n&quot;homeschooling&quot; and I spent time browsing the Internet. I stumbled upon<br/>\nunschooling.com and started discussing the ideas posted with DH. I also<br/>\nposted some and got some ideas pretty uh &quot;firmly&quot; challenged and I&#39;d go<br/>\naway fuming only to continue pondering the ideas and talking with DH.<br/>\nMind you, we had no kids at the time so it was all pretty theoretical.<br/>\nBut, I&#39;d keep going back and we kept talking and pondering. Then I found<br/>\nout that DS was on the way. According to MIL, &quot;the&quot; call went something<br/>\nlike &quot;Hi. Guess what? I&#39;m pregnant and we&#39;re planning to homeschool.&quot;<br/>\nLOL Not sure that it was -quite- like that but probably not far off<br/>\nsince we were set on unschooling by the time DS was born. <br/>\n <br/>\nBut, still, the expansion of the idea into other areas took more time.<br/>\n&quot;schoolwise&quot; it connected easily - even more easily for DH than for me<br/>\nbecause I *loved* school, my preferred learning style just fits well<br/>\nwith typical schools plus it was way back before the high pressure<br/>\ntesting stuff. Teachers apparently had lots more leeway. For example,<br/>\nwhen I was in second grade, the school had &quot;Parent&#39;s Day&quot; where parents<br/>\ncould come in and sit in the back of the classroom and observe for as<br/>\nlong as they wanted - 15 minutes to all day, whatever. My mom sat in my<br/>\nclass and was absolutely stunned to watch me getting up and roaming<br/>\naround the room, doing this and that, WHILE the teacher was up front<br/>\ndelivering a lesson to my classmates. Afterward, she went up and asked<br/>\nthe teacher about it, thinking there was some problem. Nope, the teacher<br/>\nexplained that I *already* understood that material so I was doing some<br/>\nother things she had arranged for me to do. Not likely to see that<br/>\nhappening nowadays. For DH, however, school was one of those things to<br/>\njust get through - once he got a concept (which he did quickly most<br/>\ntimes), he wanted to move on, not repeat it three times to make sure<br/>\neveryone else caught on. So, he&#39;d get bored and tune out and basically<br/>\njust tolerate it the way you tolerate a long car ride - there&#39;d be<br/>\noccasional interesting bits but the rest was mostly mundane. For him,<br/>\nthe idea of letting our son have the freedom to explore when and what<br/>\nand how was *exactly* what he had wished for (and what MIL wishes she<br/>\nknew about back when). <br/>\n <br/>\nThings like freedom in regard to food connected more easily because I<br/>\nwas already nursing on demand. It made sense to simply feed DS when and<br/>\nwhat he wanted even when he moved on to solid foods. We still get<br/>\ncomments (he&#39;s 9 now) on &quot;how did we get him to eat x?&quot; or &quot;wow he&#39;s got<br/>\nan amazing range of foods&quot; (usually that ones after he gets into a<br/>\ndetailed discussion of which types of sushi and sashimi he enjoys) as<br/>\nwell as comments on &quot;why isn&#39;t he stuffing himself with cookies and<br/>\ncandies?&quot; while other parents are trying to contain their own kids. <br/>\n <br/>\nBedtimes took a little longer but we pondered and discussed and by the<br/>\ntime DS was about 5, we just said Yes when he wanted to stay up to watch<br/>\nsomething (I think it was a 4 episode &#39;block&#39; of a favorite-at-the-time<br/>\ncartoon), with a light reminder to turn off the TV and lights on the way<br/>\nup to bed, and that we&#39;d still probably be awake when it was over. He<br/>\nspent a couple days &#39;testing&#39; this new thing and then decided that he<br/>\npreferred coming up to snuggle with Mommy while Mommy was still a bit<br/>\nawake (I WOH fulltime so I&#39;m the only one with a &#39;bedtime&#39; - I need to<br/>\nbe in bed, heading toward sleep, by about 10 pm, though I do<br/>\noccasionally stay awake until 11). Now, at 9, he&#39;ll sometimes come<br/>\nsnuggle for a while as I fall asleep, then head to his room to watch TV<br/>\nfor a bit if he&#39;s not sleepy. He may stay in his room or he might come<br/>\nback into our bed once he&#39;s sleepy. It&#39;s really variable right now - I<br/>\nthink he&#39;s starting to feel a bit squished now that he&#39;s getting bigger<br/>\n(I usually end up in the middle between him and DH - that&#39;s a squash for<br/>\nsure but it&#39;s nice and toasty in the winter). <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing that really took some work was the idea of &quot;discipline&quot; -<br/>\nnothing wrong with one open handed swat to the diapered bottom, right?<br/>\nUh well actually... That ended by the time DS was about 3 because he<br/>\nfigured it was &quot;fair&quot; that if we swatted him that he could swat us. That<br/>\nrequired a quick re-thinking and it dawned on us &quot;Duh! We&#39;re hitting him<br/>\nand at the same time telling him not to hit. Talk about mixed messages!&quot;<br/>\nWhat we learned pretty quickly is that DS has very little tolerance for<br/>\narbitrarily drawn divisions between what adults can do and what kids can<br/>\ndo. For instance, he&#39;s fine that kids can&#39;t drive cars on the highway -<br/>\nthat&#39;s for adults (and older teens) and it makes sense to him - he can&#39;t<br/>\nsee over the steering wheel so it would be dangerous. On the other hand,<br/>\nhow come adults can use any &quot;swear&quot; words they want but kids get gasped<br/>\nat, at minimum, if they use the exact same words. Or, why can adults<br/>\nstay up as late as they want but kids (typically speaking) have enforced<br/>\nbedtimes, even though adults need to get up just as early. So, whatever<br/>\nwords DS hears us say, he is free to say (which makes for a strong<br/>\nincentive to ONLY use words we&#39;d be comfortable with DS saying to his<br/>\ngrandparents lol). <br/>\n <br/>\nIt really does take more effort to expand unschooling ideas into the<br/>\nrest of life and we&#39;re still working our way through it as we reach new<br/>\nchallenges and adventures but it is so worth it.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
