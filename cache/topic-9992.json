I am new here, I just followed a link and joined up <br/>\ntoday.  :)  I am the proud mother of 2 beautiful dd and the wife of <br/>\none slightly grumpy dh.  ;)  (he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s trying to <br/>\nfigure out what&#39;s wrong with my car)  We have had a wonderful <br/>\nValentine&#39;s Day...enjoying being with people we love.  We took my <br/>\nSIL a DVD slideshow (pics of her kids) for her b-day, then stopped <br/>\nfor milkshakes and curly fries with cheese on the way home.  When we <br/>\nfirst got up this am. it was CHOCOLATE FOR EVERYONE!!!!  I&#39;m <br/>\nnibbling on my truffles as I type.   :)  DH gave me a vintage <br/>\nstapler he picked up at a flea market for Valentine&#39;s Day, and I got <br/>\na lot of mileage out of pretending to be mystified by it.  LOL  It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen beautiful and warm outside today, which is always nice, <br/>\nespecially in February!  Oh, I guess I&#39;m rambling...I have just <br/>\nenjoyed this day so much and wanted to share it a little. :)  <br/>\n  About us, my girls have never been in a PS, my oldest did a year <br/>\nof Headstart which we both hated, and they haven&#39;t been away from me <br/>\nsince.  They read almost constantly (Dh is talking about building us <br/>\na library for all our books this summer!)  they love to watch <br/>\nGilligan&#39;s Island (we bought the DVD series), they are very much <br/>\ninto their pets, 4 cats, 2 dogs, 10 rabbits, and one smelly <br/>\nferrett.  They work on their altered books a lot, and their <br/>\nscrapbooks, and we just recently discovered Art Trading Cards, which <br/>\nthey have been enjoying doing.  Really, anything crafty they are <br/>\ninto.  DH has been working on video production and animation lately <br/>\nand they are getting interested in that with him.  It&#39;s so much fun <br/>\nwatching them find things they are interested in and trying so many <br/>\nnew things.  My oldest dd (10) decided she wanted to do carpentry, <br/>\nso she asked for tools for her b-day...she hasn&#39;t made anything yet, <br/>\nbut when she decided to, she has the equipment.  <br/>\n I know I have gone on and on, but it&#39;s nice to be here with you all <br/>\nand I look forward to getting to know you.<br/>\nPaige</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9993,"nextTopicId":9991}}
