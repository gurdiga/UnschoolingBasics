Many adults enjoy some of their children&#39;s stages of development  <br/>\nmore than others. And my experience is that only children need a bit more of  <br/>\nthat adult interaction (maybe mostly because a suitable playmate isn&#39;t  <br/>\nconveniently sitting around the house.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sure you&#39;re already connecting up with other kids to play with. But  have <br/>\nyou thought of checking around for somebody like a kind pre- or young teen  <br/>\nwho likes small children and would like experience for future babysitting? You  <br/>\ncould be in the house doing some other things, and he or she will play with <br/>\nyour  daughter. <br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn  <br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling Conference, Memorial Day Weekend, May <br/>\n26-28, 2006 in  Peabody, Massachusetts!  www.NortheastUnschoolingConference.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157089938,"authorName":"S Drag-teine","from":"&quot;S Drag-teine&quot; &lt;dragteine@...&gt;","profile":"dragteine76","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling my 2.5 y.o.","postDate":"1143684440","msgId":11176,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMDgwMWM2NTM5ZSRhZTEyOTc3MCQyZTUwZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjAzMjkxNzQxcTNmOWRjYjExaDU5NTdjMmYxNWNjZDQ5YzlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11173,"nextInTopic":11189,"prevInTime":11175,"nextInTime":11177,"topicId":11103,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I always forget those things mostly because I take it for granted that my son and now my daughter help put clothes in the basket to do laundry , match socks,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1067941403\">I always forget those things mostly because I take it for granted that my<br/>\nson and now my daughter help put clothes in the basket to &quot;do laundry&quot;,<br/>\nmatch socks, sort toys, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Pampered Chef<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, March 29, 2006 8:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling my 2.5 y.o.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/29/06, Misty Felner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:misty@...\">misty@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She wants to play for a good hour several times a day.<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally the problem is that I&#39;d like to have  a minute to myself to<br/>\n&gt; cook a meal, check e-mail, shower, etc. and she gets very upset if I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; play with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would sometimes tell my children, &quot;I can only play for 15 minutes as I<br/>\nhave something I need/want to do.&quot;  I would often invite my children to join<br/>\nme in what *I* wanted/needed to do.

My daughter is a great<br/>\ncommunicator, and has always let me know what&#39;s on her mind.  (Pardon me<br/>\nwhile I brag on her a minute.) As a former deaf ed teacher I taught her<br/>\nAmerican Sign Language at a year, and by 18 months she had over 150 signs in<br/>\nher vocabulary when she started talking at 20 months she just took off and<br/>\nby the time she was 2 she sounded like a 3 yr old. She&#39;s been telling me<br/>\nwhat she wants to eat, play, wear, etc. since she was 15 months.  My problem<br/>\nis she usually has some idea of what she wants to play and it always has to<br/>\ninclude me.  A mother can only play with play dough or pretend with stuffed<br/>\nanimals, for so long.  She doesn&#39;t want to play on her own so I&#39;m just<br/>\nlooking for some new alternatives that might captivate her.  I live in<br/>\nPlano, TX just north of Dallas.  I try to check out some of the local sites<br/>\ncalendars to find things going on and enroll her every once in while in<br/>\nrecreation center classes for a change of pace, but sometimes I feel I might<br/>\nbe forcing her out of the house too much, so I was interested in what other<br/>\nmoms did all day at home.   She&#39;s not too much into music though once a week<br/>\nor so she&#39;s willing to turn some on to dance to.  She does like art so we do<br/>\nsome painting, play dough work, and various gluing and coloring projects.<br/>\nBut as I think I said before or maybe in another post she constantly wants<br/>\nme to play with her stuffed animals, and I&#39;m starting to really tire of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of S Drag-teine<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 28, 2006 9:23 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling my 2.5 y.o.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
