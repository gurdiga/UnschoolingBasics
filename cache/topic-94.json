That&#39;s in sw Montana on I-90<br/>\nbetween Butte and Missoula if anyone&#39;s ever passing through this way and<br/>\nwould like to stop and bounce on the trampoline for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live with my son Dylan, who is twelve now and my husband David who is<br/>\ncreeping up on forty five.  I&#39;m forty one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan has never been to school.  Once, when David and I decided we should<br/>\nconsider what would happen to Dylan if we died, I said we&#39;d have to be<br/>\nsure he was with someone who wouldn&#39;t make him go to school.   David said<br/>\nnot to worry, there was no one on earth could make Dylan go to school.<br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan loves animals, insects, the comics page in the newspaper, politics,<br/>\nGodzilla movies, hiking, camping rock and fossil hunting, story telling,<br/>\npopcorn, telling terrible jokes, and playing chess.   He has long hair<br/>\nalways wears sweats, walks through every puddle and climbs over every<br/>\nrock and tree stump and we just found out he has psoriasis. = (  bummer. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s pretty sure he&#39;ll live in a motor home and travel and write novels<br/>\nand comic books and make movies and work as an equipment operator at some<br/>\npoint in his very busy sounding future. &lt;g&gt;   I wouldn&#39;t be a bit<br/>\nsurprised. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy unschooling, everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":97,"nextTopicId":127}}
