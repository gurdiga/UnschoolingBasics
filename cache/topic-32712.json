A few days ago,<br/>\nwe just had a major shift in the way we deal with Lego&#39;s.  Previously,<br/>\nthe Lego&#39;s were in my older sons room, spilling out onto the hall<br/>\nfloor and into the other bedrooms and even the stairs.  Lot&#39;s of<br/>\nouchies while walking around upstairs!  He never had any<br/>\npossessiveness over the Lego&#39;s, just his room and his creations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys are switching rooms in anticipation of the baby, (my oldest<br/>\nasked for the smaller room so &quot;baby stuff&quot; didn&#39;t go in his room, oh<br/>\nand IF we painted it red and he could sleep in the closet!)  Anyway...<br/>\n while cleaning the rooms I had bought some giant bins at BigLots for<br/>\ntoys because the stairs are becoming a problem for me.  Up and down up<br/>\nand down!  Plus when the baby comes I&#39;d rather sit at the table with<br/>\nthem, then on their floors.  Now their toys are organized and in bins<br/>\nin the dining room.  Including a half a ton of Lego&#39;s.  But guess<br/>\nwhat?  They are playing together, more often, and I&#39;ve even gotten in<br/>\non the building.  They love it.  They&#39;ve been playing Lego&#39;s,<br/>\nHeroscape, and duplo blocks for days now.  I also organized a big<br/>\ngame/art shelf and suddenly they are enjoying each other&#39;s company<br/>\nmore often on that too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I found when my kids got their OWN rooms, they started fighting<br/>\nMORE.  This is when possessiveness actually took over.  I heard a lot<br/>\nof &quot;It&#39;s my room!  Get out!&quot;  There were LOTS of hurt feelings.

We have done different things with them depending on the stages he and his little brother are going through.  At one time he played with them on the top bunk bed where they could be left out at all times.  Next, I started missing him being around me so we put them in drawers downstairs that he played in.  Then we moved them up to the playroom and used a train table with Lego plates attached.  He could leave them all over the table and in the 2 GIANT drawers under the table.  This way they didn&#39;t have to be picked up, but they were still all visible for him.  Now he has started needing time alone with Legos so we&#39;ve moved the table to his bedroom where he can play without his little brother interfering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way that my son would want his Legos in neat bins!  This would be a need of mine, but not his.  I do provide plenty of shelves for completed projects.  But works in progress always stay out on his table.  I try to help him protect his creations while he works on them by playing with my boys.  My oldest sits at one side of the table and he gives my youngest a pile of Legos to play with.  I stay with them as needed.  Sometimes there is no intervention needed and they just play on their own, other times I get them started and then stay close, other times I stay the entire time, and other times I just let my older son play with the Legos while I do something with the little brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea that my sister uses-  she puts Legos in giant suitcases (she has more than one and she doesn&#39;t fill them very full).  Then whoever wants to play with the Legos can tote them to a private area.  Also, then they can be stored under the beds.  I would have them spread out a bed sheet under the suitcase to play on, then just dump the Legos back in the suitcase when they&#39;re done.

But I get volcanic myself at times.  I&#39;m not as bad as before<br/>\nbut still not good enough.  I try to pick up and invite them without<br/>\nstrings attached but things like runaway legos and brotherly fights<br/>\nsend me around the bend.  How do I stop and start repairing the<br/>\nrelationship so that they feel welcome to clean up of their own<br/>\naccord? I don&#39;t want to be a martyr but there is a lot of work to be<br/>\ndone on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing that drives me nuts about the Legos - I hated chewing<br/>\non them, they didn&#39;t taste good. I wanted them to be pristine. In fact<br/>\nI remember marking them once, on a set that I made and didn&#39;t plan to<br/>\ntake apart for a long time. I also didn&#39;t even like stickers gumming<br/>\nthem up.  So, having my son chew them up drives me nuts. I can&#39;t stand<br/>\nseeing pieces rendered useless and unrecognizable, because I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo that to my own legos. Jael has a serious need to chew on stuff. I<br/>\ntry to accomodate that by giving him gum and etc - but the legos?<br/>\nPlease noooooo. It&#39;s MY issue I know.  Do I need to keep this one to<br/>\nmyself or intervene? The boys&#39; collection IS valuable - one, because I<br/>\nnever had that much myself to create so much, and two, because it<br/>\ncould get hundreds if sold on ebay. I know that they&#39;d love it if they<br/>\nhad more intact pieces when older and more appreciative of it. ASL:<br/>\ndo-do-do?

He yells and gets hostile with them, even<br/>\npunching them if they start playing with his Legos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were his for a long time until his upstart twin brothers came<br/>\nalong.  They used to dump out the whole bin, which is why we got the<br/>\nnew drawered bins so they could find the pieces easily. I can&#39;t forbid<br/>\nthe twins from touching those legos because they are of age where they<br/>\ncan play with the little ones and their legos are getting mixed in.<br/>\nHow can I help them feel secure with their toys without feeling at<br/>\nodds with each other and me?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a principle of asking before playing with someone else&#39;s<br/>\ntoy, even in the house. But the twins forget - I do ask for them. It&#39;s<br/>\nstill volcanic anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to keep the home neat even with three active boys and being on<br/>\nmy own. But I get volcanic myself at times.  I&#39;m not as bad as before<br/>\nbut still not good enough.  I try to pick up and invite them without<br/>\nstrings attached but things like runaway legos and brotherly fights<br/>\nsend me around the bend.  How do I stop and start repairing the<br/>\nrelationship so that they feel welcome to clean up of their own<br/>\naccord? I don&#39;t want to be a martyr but there is a lot of work to be<br/>\ndone on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing that drives me nuts about the Legos - I hated chewing<br/>\non them, they didn&#39;t taste good. I wanted them to be pristine. In fact<br/>\nI remember marking them once, on a set that I made and didn&#39;t plan to<br/>\ntake apart for a long time. I also didn&#39;t even like stickers gumming<br/>\nthem up.  So, having my son chew them up drives me nuts. I can&#39;t stand<br/>\nseeing pieces rendered useless and unrecognizable, because I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo that to my own legos. Jael has a serious need to chew on stuff. I<br/>\ntry to accomodate that by giving him gum and etc - but the legos?<br/>\nPlease noooooo. It&#39;s MY issue I know.  Do I need to keep this one to<br/>\nmyself or intervene? The boys&#39; collection IS valuable - one, because I<br/>\nnever had that much myself to create so much, and two, because it<br/>\ncould get hundreds if sold on ebay. I know that they&#39;d love it if they<br/>\nhad more intact pieces when older and more appreciative of it. ASL:<br/>\ndo-do-do?
