High stress, medical issues, family dysfunction and, yes, divorce can be big big barriers to unschooling. I&#39;ve dealt with some of those over the course of Ray&#39;s life (he&#39;s my stepson) and its hard. One of the hardest things is stepping away from hopes and dreams of homeschooling and unschooling and looking at relationships - what&#39;s going to help him have a *better* relationship with us, with his bio-mom, and with himself. Unschooling hasn&#39;t always been the best option. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even when unschooling isn&#39;t possible, or isn&#39;t a good option, the principles of living kindly and supportively with other people (including children) are Always possible. The underlying principles of radical unschooling transcend education and even childhood. If you&#39;re in the position of needing to put kids in school for awhile, be supportive, be kind, be proactive. Help kids get in a routine so its not *such* an agony to go. Help them with homework, even do it for them if they want you to do that! Be their number one advocate, their safe space, their trusted assistant. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Need answers quick, Help Please","postDate":"1273923644","msgId":44070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzbTE3cytmZmEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzY205cytvNmlzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44067,"nextInTopic":44071,"prevInTime":44069,"nextInTime":44071,"topicId":43978,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************** Yes, thank you, JJ, I stopped reading the quick answers thread and didn t realize this was in the middle of it, sorry y all.
