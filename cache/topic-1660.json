Pay attention to the details...<br/>\n<br/>\nMilitary Draft May Be Reinstated<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin bills: S <br/>\n89 and HR 163) to reinstate the draft.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBill S 89 was introduced by Sen. Fritz Hollings and Bill HR 163 was <br/>\nintroduced by Michigan&#39;s Rep. John Conyers and Rep. Charles Rangel (D-<br/>\nN.Y.). This plan, among other things, eliminates higher education as <br/>\na shelter and includes women as eligible to be drafted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSen. Hollings introduced The National Service Act of 2003, &quot;which <br/>\nprovides for the common defense by requiring that all young persons <br/>\n[age 18-26] in the United States, including women, perform a period <br/>\nof military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of <br/>\nthe national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to fill all 10,350 <br/>\ndraft board positions and 11,070 appeals board slots nationwide. <br/>\nThough this is an unpopular election year topic, military experts and <br/>\ninfluential members of congress are suggesting that if Rumsfeld&#39;s <br/>\nprediction of a &quot;long, hard slog&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan [and a <br/>\npermanent state of war on &quot;terrorism&quot;] proves accurate, the U.S. may <br/>\nhave no choice but to draft. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDodging the draft will be more difficult than in the Vietnam era. <br/>\nCollege and Canada will not be options. In December 2001, Canada and <br/>\nthe U.S. signed a &quot;smart border declaration,&quot; which could be used to <br/>\nkeep would-be draft dodgers in. Reforms aimed at making the draft <br/>\nmore equitable along gender and class lines also eliminates higher <br/>\neducation as a shelter. Underclassmen would only be able to postpone <br/>\nservice until the end of their current semester. Seniors would have <br/>\nuntil the end of the academic year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n$28 million has been added to the 2004 selective service system (SSS) <br/>\nbudget to prepare for a military draft that could start as early as <br/>\nJune 15, 2005. The Selective Service must report to the President on <br/>\nMarch 31, 2005 that the system, which has lain dormant for decades, <br/>\nthat it is ready for activation.

It isn&#39;t <br/>\nlikely to be acted upon before the election.
