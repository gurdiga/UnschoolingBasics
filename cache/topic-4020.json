Thats me! Thats Me! I feel that way, she spoke for me, I&#39;m new and you answered her BUT you answered me too and I&#39;m so grateful and thankful and glad to be here!!<br/>\nI posted at AlwaysLearning (i think) and it was aboput principles vs rules and how I needed more guidance and my &quot;delicate sanity&quot; but I think the &quot;control issue&quot; part of these posts was really the meat of what was going on with me and (fate/something/?/i need a better word) intervened and I&#39;m just relieved. So,gayle, by posting and really giving where you were , you gave me the words to where I was, and all the rest of you who responded to her, you helped me , too.
