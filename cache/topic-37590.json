It&#39;s <br/>\nvery hard for a parent to let go of that, when evidence (I&#39;m speaking only from <br/>\npersonal experience) rears it&#39;s ugly head around every day that a degree opens <br/>\nup a lot more choices.  My colleague has many years of parent education <br/>\nexperience, three launched children and yet, because she doesn&#39;t have a degree <br/>\nin anything (from science to nursing) she can&#39;t get a job teaching parenting for <br/>\nour health department.  That is the basic minimum hiring standards.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd someone needs a job in the health department to help parents?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s where I start questioning. OK---so what IS &quot;parent education experience&quot;? Why would somebody need a degree to &quot;teach&quot; it? What&#39;s stopping her from getting a degree? Why can&#39;t she start her own &quot;parenting&quot; business, if that&#39;s what she wants to do? What other options are there? I have dozens of other questions---and I really don&#39;t want the answers. It&#39;s just that such a &quot;position&quot; could be looked at from *dozens* of different angles, but it seems she&#39;s only looking at one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that <br/>\ntwenty years ago, a high school diploma and  a hefty dose of inititive could get <br/>\nmany people careers in their chosen fields, but I can&#39;t say the same thing now <br/>\ndays. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTwenty years ago?  That sounds twisted20to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say, *maybe*....50 years ago. Seventy-five years ago, for SURE! But 50 years ago, a *college* diploma was a sure fire trip to easy street! Twenty years ago, it was already considered a necessity to have a college degree---and to be a *real* success, you needed a master&#39;s---THAT was your ticket out! Ten years ago, a PhD was the only way to BE somebody.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference between the 1950s and the 2000s is NOW college tuition is ASTRONOMICAL! A college student today will pay (I looked it up) about $25,000 in tuition alone for four years at a state college, and four times that for a private school---not including books and room & board! A graduate will spend *years* covering student loans if he chooses *that* route. Starting OUT with debt? Crazy! ANd there&#39;s NO guarantee that a job will be waiting! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor $120,000 (what it would cost to send Cameron four years to (one of &lt;g&gt;) my alma mater(s), a small private college in SC), I could set him up in a business of his choosing. He would be MAKING money rather than paying off debt. He wouldn&#39;t be looking for an entry-level job; he would OWN the business; he would BE the boss. It&#39;s just that I can think of waaay better ways to spend Ben&#39;s money &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he *needed* a degree to get what he wants. I would do that too. But he doesn&#39;t. Nor do *most* college students---they&#39;re just jumping through the hoops without thinking. The reason businesses put the degree requirement on their &quot;basic minimum&quot; for=2<br/>\n0hiring is that they need *some* way to weed out candidates. There&#39;s often a loophole. You may have to work to find it though. Volunteering is a great way to get a foot in the door---especially if you are already good at what you do. Many businesses will still help pay to help you get a degree if it will benefit *them*. But they have to know you first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorry to be so pessimistic.  I want to beleive that hard work and initiative will get anyone <br/>\n<br/>\nwhere they want to go, but I see so much evidence to the contrary, I can&#39;t pass that on to my <br/>\n<br/>\nkids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe you can or believe you can&#39;t, you are right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAttitude is everything. I&#39;ve owned nine businesses--and am working on the tenth.

It&#39;s very hard for a parent to let go of that, when evidence (I&#39;m speaking only from personal experience) rears it&#39;s ugly head around every day that a degree opens up a lot more choices.  My colleague has many years of parent education experience, three launched children and yet, because she doesn&#39;t have a degree in anything (from science to nursing) she can&#39;t get a job teaching parenting for our health department.  That is the basic minimum hiring standards.  I know that twenty years ago, a high school diploma and  a hefty dose of inititive could get many people careers in their chosen fields, but I can&#39;t say the same thing now days.  Sorry to be so pessimistic.

I&#39;m sorry if it sounded like I think everyone<br/>\nshould get a degree, that is certainly not the case. I agree that a goal of<br/>\nfollowing your dreams is not a goal of not going to college.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t understand the purpose of creating a list of jobs that do not<br/>\nrequire a degree unless finding a career without a degree requirement is the<br/>\ngoal. People should follow a life and career path which they are passionate<br/>\nabout and through hard work or study or whatever else is required, follow<br/>\ntheir dreams. Someone can either choose from a list like this and pursue one<br/>\nof those jobs, or follow their passion and deal with the requirements when<br/>\nthey show up. You are correct that in many cases, the requirements are more<br/>\nof guidelines anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never encourage my kids to go to college unless they knew for<br/>\ncertain what they were trying to achieve and why a degree was needed. Some<br/>\nparents may push their kids into college when nobody has any idea why they<br/>\nare even there. I went to college to get a Master&#39;s degree because I was<br/>\nexcited about computer engineering and was not being exposed to state of the<br/>\nart tech at the company I was at. The university gave me access to dozens of<br/>\nnew mentors in the industry and along with the new degree, landed me the<br/>\nposition I had long been looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil relatively recently, anyone could be a doctor with only a desire to<br/>\nheal the sick or injured and some experience. Now, by law, if medicine is<br/>\nyour calling then college is in your future. It&#39;s the same story with<br/>\nprofessional engineering. My main point was that I know people doing many of<br/>\nthe jobs on that list in some form or another and they all have degrees. I<br/>\ndo believe that college is a strict requirement for some fields, may be an<br/>\nenabler to a career in other fields, and totally irrelevant in many other<br/>\nexciting areas such as being a makeup artist. College may be exciting for<br/>\nsome, a necessary evil for others, or even a formality that is unacceptable<br/>\nto some.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow your dreams..<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 5, 2009 at 2:06 PM, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   ~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If not going to college is a goal or requirement for your life, then you<br/>\n&gt; will certainly have less options available and a more difficult time<br/>\n&gt; getting into some fields, even when a degree is not required. ~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That is a strange way to phrase it; &quot;not going to college is a goal or<br/>\n&gt; requirement&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see a choice of taking other paths a &quot;goal of not going to<br/>\n&gt; college&quot;. Rather a conscious choice by some people to pursue their<br/>\n&gt; life passions in a less formal manner. Sure, some people desire<br/>\n&gt; careers or jobs that mostly require degrees but even within a degree<br/>\n&gt; requirement there are ways to avoid the traditional college route if<br/>\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t fit for an individual.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would disagree that opting out of a college path will limit you in<br/>\n&gt; any way. A college degree in my field is useless. As a makeup artist<br/>\n&gt; the very best way to get ahead in the industry is plain-old-vanilla<br/>\n&gt; hard work. Self-motivated individuals do the best in this<br/>\n&gt; field...people willing to practice, learn, watch, trade-for-portfolio<br/>\n&gt; and basically get out there and DO. Sure, a class or workshop can<br/>\n&gt; really help hone a skill but nothing beats passion and motivation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; True in many fields.

There may be people currently in<br/>\nthose fields who do not have degrees, but a business or technical degree<br/>\nwould be beneficial for any of the &quot;supervisor&quot; type positions, even if not<br/>\nstrictly &quot;required&quot;. If someone is truly passionate about managing a payroll<br/>\ndepartment or a service station, they would also be interested in most of<br/>\nthe coursework leading to a management or business degree. It would be a<br/>\nmistake for anyone to take a job which they were not passionate about, and a<br/>\n2 or 4 year degree is not a burden if you are studying what you love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked as an engineer at a company here in Portland, Oregon for 10 years.<br/>\nWhen I started, I had a BS and many of my colleagues had started years<br/>\nearlier with no degree at all. After 10 years, I had completed a MS in<br/>\nengineering and everyone without a degree has been let go during various<br/>\nlayoffs and subsequently replaced with engineers holding MS degrees. Only 1<br/>\nengineer was left with a BS. There has been an inflation of educational<br/>\nrequirements in a lot of fields and where you used to be able to start based<br/>\non passion or experience or &quot;who you know&quot;, many jobs will require a degree<br/>\nor certification because many employers use it to differentiate between an<br/>\nover-abundance of applicants in a tight job market.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not going to college is a goal or requirement for your life, then you<br/>\nwill certainly have less options available and a more difficult time getting<br/>\ninto some fields, even when a degree is not required. I imagine that<br/>\ntechnical trades such as plumbers and electricians would be a good match for<br/>\nsomeone who wanted to get right in and manage their own path.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Dan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jan 5, 2009 at 10:02 AM, Deb &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msn.careerbuilder.com/Article/MSN-1748-Salaries-and-Promotions-\">http://msn.careerbuilder.com/Article/MSN-1748-Salaries-and-Promotions-</a><br/>\n&gt; 20-Big-Salary-Jobs-No-Degree-Required/?<br/>\n&gt; cbsid=20dee4cf1c184d2ca1f947fd3225b0a7-284475371-wj-<br/>\n&gt; 6&sc_extcmp=JS_1748_home1&cbRecursionCnt=2&SiteId=cbmsnhp41748&ArticleID<br/>\n&gt; =1748&GT1=23000<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; An article listing 20 jobs that don&#39;t require a college degree and yet<br/>\n&gt; make $50K or more per year.
