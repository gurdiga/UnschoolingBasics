Keon falls into <br/>\nthat broad spectrum of autistic (very high functioning - auspergers <br/>\nend more than autistic end if you understand the spectrum)  Anyway, <br/>\nhe does much better if he knows how the day is going to work out.  <br/>\nHe isn&#39;t very easy to disengage from what he expects to do and he <br/>\nisn&#39;t always keen to spontenaiety.  Rarely can I say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go <br/>\ndo this!&quot;  Now if it is going to see Jalen at Ren&#39;s house he is all <br/>\nfor it LOL! and most of the time I can suggest the park as an <br/>\nalternative to what is already in our day, but not always.  And <br/>\ndoing things out of order isn&#39;t a good idea either.  For instance if <br/>\nI say we need to go to Foodworld and Target and I go to Target first <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t always go well.  Even explaining why we can&#39;t go buy ice <br/>\ncream and leave it in the car while we go into Target because it <br/>\nwill melt just &quot;doesn&#39;t compute.&quot;  I *said* we were going to <br/>\nFoodworld and Target not Target and Foodworld (and I better not stop <br/>\nat Pier One between!)  So I have to be careful how I phrase things, <br/>\nso that I don&#39;t get myself in trouble!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when we pulled our girls out of school, they each had to work <br/>\nthrough the &quot;what are we going to do today&quot; thing.  They each <br/>\nexpected me to plan out their days, but the longer that we are free <br/>\nfrom schedules the less they have asked for &quot;structure.&quot;  I still <br/>\nget asked, &quot;Are we going to do anything today?&quot; but it is more <br/>\nof &quot;do we have anything planned that I need to get dressed for?&quot;  <br/>\nLOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":200155843,"authorName":"Rodney and Rebecca Atherton","from":"&quot;Rodney and Rebecca Atherton&quot; &lt;rebeccawow@...&gt;","profile":"wow_academy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] demanding structure? was help!","postDate":"1110583081","msgId":5018,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzExMjI0MS5qMkJNZThoMzAwMjgzN0BmbHB2bTIyLnByb2RpZ3kubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":5017,"nextInTopic":5023,"prevInTime":5017,"nextInTime":5019,"topicId":5017,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
