My children are about the same age as your children.  What I do awaken with a plan for myself and with the agenda for my children to have fun.  I find that the more I go with the flow and just commit to involving myself in my children&#39;s day and their interests, the learning happens and the day is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all new things there is an ebb and flow.  Until we are truly comfortable with unschooling, we will vacillate.  It does not make us bad, it is just an indicator for growth.  Your bad days will decrease as you trust the process more but also change your perspective.  I have felt very similar as you.  I just try to learn from it and start the next day fresh and anew.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you the best<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: homeschoolcrew6 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, December 13, 2005 7:55 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Today was one of those panic days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  *sigh* Today was a realyl bad day for me....really bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":188668263,"authorName":"Su Penn","from":"Su Penn &lt;pennsu@...&gt;","profile":"marie101365","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Today was one of those panic days.","postDate":"1134537984","msgId":8340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MzY5MkEwLUZFMjQtNDk1MC04MEQ5LTExMUM2RkY5RTE0OUBtc3UuZWR1Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRubnUyOStjdmtqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRubnUyOStjdmtqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":8336,"nextInTopic":8344,"prevInTime":8339,"nextInTime":8341,"topicId":8334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey, P, are you on the Always Unschooled list?
