Does your husband wake up each morning and ask you what you want to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1835077182\">&quot;Or do you wake up each morning and ask the kids what<br/>\nthey want to learn about today?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your husband wake up each morning and ask you what you want to <br/>\nlearn about? Do you wake up and think &quot;what do I want to learn about <br/>\ntoday?&quot;<br/>\nI don&#39;t.<br/>\nI DO think about all the cool things I&#39;d like to start as projects <br/>\n(for myself) and info. I need to look up that has sparked my <br/>\ninterest at some point, or places I&#39;d like to go.<br/>\nSo yeah, it has some structure in that we all have things we&#39;d like <br/>\nto do.<br/>\nBut I never, ever say &quot;kids, what do you want to learn about today?&quot;<br/>\nThey&#39;d look at me like I just dropped in from Mars!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO ask if they have any place they need to go today, or what they <br/>\nwant to eat for breakfast.  Kids learn by living...people learn by <br/>\nliving. So make the living really great today, that&#39;s the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake your lives interesting and rich, not to learn anything, but to <br/>\nhave a rich and interesting life!  People that lead interesting <br/>\nlives, LEARN new stuff all the time. Honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the best way to transition. Forget about what they &quot;need&quot; to <br/>\nlearn and start figuring out what makes you all happy. Maybe today, <br/>\nit&#39;s just watching a movie together, cuddling and reading a book or <br/>\nbaking some bread. Make your home a refuge for all that live there, <br/>\nmake your days all about good living and the learning will bubble <br/>\nand flow constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the vetrinarian interest, the best way to squash it is to <br/>\nfocus on the career aspect right now. What parts does your child <br/>\nlike about the vet thing? If it&#39;s the animals, start visiting places <br/>\nwhere they can be around animals...pet stores, zoos, aquariums, <br/>\nwildlife sanctuaries, breeders, farms, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my child liked GI Joe, I&#39;d buy them GI Joe stuff...as much as our <br/>\nbudget would allow anyway.  When you see the whole wide world as a <br/>\nbig playroom, waiting to be explored, their interests are an excuse <br/>\nto explore, not to &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8035,"nextTopicId":8045}}
