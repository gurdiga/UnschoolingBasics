All it is is a bunch of black lines on pages. Reading books has been frustrating for him, though he reads any word which comes his way. He is reading, but it is slow and he continues to sound out words very slowly which gets in his way of comprehending anything story like. It is amazing to see the things which he focuses on. My programmed to read mind often sees only the words, while my son points out color changes, or symbols, or other really interesting things. While he would like reading to be easier, he absolutely does not want to be made to read for readings sake. I asked him, because he does seem to read more fluently when he reads often, like every day. His answer was, Mom, &quot; I don&#39;t want you to ever MAKE me do anything.&quot; I love the bond between parent and child in unschooling homes. <br/>\nAlso, he plays Halo online, and sometimes the other players cuse and write nasty stuff, but my guy doesn&#39;t focus on the dialogue, he focuses on the playing.

Listen to them.<br/>\nNothing you are forcing is going to help them, it&#39;s only going to<br/>\nhinder. Is good spelling more important than joy in learning?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Jared (almost 13) learned to read this year. Shame and guilt would<br/>\nNOT have helped him. Pressure or lessons would not have brought him<br/>\ncloser to joyful reading. He reads wonderfully and types messages to<br/>\nother players in online games, occasionally stopping to ask me how<br/>\nsomething is spelled. He doesn&#39;t have ANY of the baggage a schooled<br/>\n(at home or otherwise) child would have over reading later. We all<br/>\nlearn things in our own way and time....parents can either facilitate<br/>\njoy in learning, or dampen it.
