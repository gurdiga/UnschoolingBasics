They were in the first, <br/>\nfourth and repeating the fifth grade when I removed them. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Do you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or <br/>\non your own, etc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all think up ideas for various activites and projects. Sometimes <br/>\nI suggest something, other times one of them will. My kids are very <br/>\ninto creating things and experimenting with stuff and they&#39;re <br/>\nusually up for anything. <br/>\n<br/>\n3) Do you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely <br/>\nlet them follow their own interests?  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I don&#39;t *make* them learn certain things. That would go against <br/>\neverything that I trust about unschooling. To be honest, I learn <br/>\nstuff from my nine year old. She&#39;s the type of person that HATES <br/>\nwhen there&#39;s something she doesn&#39;t know. Take algebra for example. <br/>\nShe was watching Apollo 13 last year with my husband (she&#39;s big into <br/>\nspace and astronomy) and saw them figuring out math (I didn&#39;t see <br/>\nthe movie but i think it was the scene where they&#39;re trying to get <br/>\nthe ship back) and she asked my husband what they were doing. He <br/>\nsaid it looked liked algebra. Since then, she&#39;s on a quest to learn <br/>\nit and won&#39;t rest until she does. She&#39;s been asking my husband to <br/>\nshow her how to do it but he told her he needs to brush up on it <br/>\nfirst and kept putting her off. She used her own money to buy a used <br/>\nalgebra textbook from a used book store and that night she asked him <br/>\nto read her a bedtime story (you know where this is going, right-<br/>\nlol) He went into her room, snuggled up in bed with her and asked <br/>\nfor the book. She pulled out the algebra book from under her pillow <br/>\nand gave it to him. lol I love that she thinks nothing is out of her <br/>\nreach. She wants to learn everything. I also love that she took her <br/>\nlearning into her own hands and didn&#39;t wait for my husband to buy a <br/>\nbook on his own. And to think...it started with a movie. <br/>\n<br/>\n4) Do you try to expose your children to new <br/>\nideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we do this by just trying to live an interesting life. They <br/>\nexpose me to lots of new stuff also. A museum near us just had an <br/>\nexhibit of dresses that belonged to Princess Diana and my daughters <br/>\nasked if we could go. It was a very interesting day and we found out <br/>\na lot about her that we didn&#39;t know. If it wasn&#39;t for my daughters <br/>\nsuggesting it, I probbaly wouldn&#39;t have gone. <br/>\n<br/>\n5) Are your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it? <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes...but I have found my kids enjoy trying new stuff so <br/>\nthey&#39;re pretty much open to new ideas. When they don&#39;t want to do <br/>\nsomething I suggested, I try *very hard* not to take it personal, or <br/>\nat least not to let it show. That&#39;s been tough for me but I&#39;m better <br/>\nat it than I was.    <br/>\n<br/>\n6) Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with <br/>\nthem?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was very supportive. She thought homeschooling/unschooling <br/>\nwas fantastic. As far as other relatives, it doesn&#39;t come up much <br/>\nbut they&#39;re kind of used to me and my off-the-beaten-path ideas. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n7) If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>\nconcern you?  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>\nshyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t help you there. All three of my kids are quite outgoing and <br/>\nare usually the first ones to introduce themselves to other kids and <br/>\nstart playing with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think being shy is something you should help your child <br/>\novercome or hope they grow out of it. It&#39;s part of who they are <br/>\nright now. That needs to be respected, not changed. People change on <br/>\ntheir own and evolve over time  so she may well end up a more <br/>\noutgoing person later on in life but honor her for who she is right <br/>\nnow. If she wants help with making new friends or starting a <br/>\nconversation, then by all means, help her. But if she&#39;s fine with it <br/>\nand it&#39;s not getting in the way of her being happy, I&#39;d leave it <br/>\nalone. <br/>\n<br/>\n8) If you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal <br/>\nwith the anxiousness?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy middle daughter has had anxiety issues since she moved in with <br/>\nus. (We adopted her when she was seven after she was abused and in <br/>\nfoster care for four years) and still will worry and become overly <br/>\nanxious about things. It was hard in the beginning because that <br/>\nanxiousness was mixed in with a lot of anger. As the anger subsided, <br/>\nso did a lot of her fears (weather was a big trigger for her) but I <br/>\nhave found that two things helped her the most. One is talking to <br/>\nher about things before they happen. The other is giving her tools <br/>\nto calm herself down.  <br/>\n<br/>\n9) Any help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - <br/>\nright now, I need all the help I can get!  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust what you&#39;re doing is great. Asking questions and reading about <br/>\nunschooling is a step in the right direction. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to read some of the past editions of Unschooling <br/>\nVoices because it addresses some of the questions you brought up <br/>\nhere.

She hated it.  We tried to<br/>\ndo a bit of structure this past year with a &quot;Hogwarts&quot; type curriculum (but<br/>\nwe were very relaxed about it).  She loved the &quot;Potions&quot; (experiments) and<br/>\n&quot;Honeydukes&quot; (cooking) part of it, but didn&#39;t like having to do assignments<br/>\nand she didn&#39;t really like the rest of it at all.

I just give them the time and space and perhaps advice they<br/>\nneed to learn to deal with it or we throw the idea out the window and<br/>\n&quot;forget&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Most of them are supportive of homeschooling.  We don&#39;t discuss unschooling<br/>\nwith them.  It is not a topic most people are open to.  Many of them still<br/>\nmake comments every so often, but I have learned to let them slide.  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t care anymore what they say, however, it has taken me 3 1/2 years to<br/>\nget to this point.  The two things that have helped me the most are having<br/>\nthe phrase &quot;we are just going to try this for this year&quot; handy and<br/>\n(especially with my in laws) just smiling and nodding. At which point I turn<br/>\nto my lists for support (most of the time just reading helps me stay<br/>\nconcrete in my decisions).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof, concern<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; you?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No. When my oldest was younger she would talk to anyone, except the person<br/>\nwho talked to her.  Now, she is about the same, except for most gruff males<br/>\n(nearly all of my uncles who are fully bearded for example).  She won&#39;t talk<br/>\nto them. Not sure I blame her.  They are pretty scary, plus she doesn&#39;t see<br/>\nthem a lot so she isn&#39;t used to them.  She is mostly extroverted, like my<br/>\nhusband.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest could be considered really &quot;shy&quot; and that is what most people<br/>\nsay to her when she hides behind me when they talk to her, however, the<br/>\nreality is more like this.  She is an introvert.  She needs time to take in<br/>\na situation before acting on it.  When we go to a gathering it is typical<br/>\nthat she spends the first 1/2 hour to hour on my lap.  It&#39;s where she feels<br/>\nsafe.  It is where she can observe while still having mom&#39;s protection.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think there is anything wrong with that.  It&#39;s beautiful and a<br/>\nwonderful escape for me if there is someone I want to avoid &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you do to help your child overcome his or her shyness, or do you<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My youngest may never outgrow it.  I was &quot;shy&quot; as a child and I am shy now.<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with me.  If she wants to not be shy when she is<br/>\nolder she will find a way to overcome it.  I have begun overcoming it over<br/>\nthe last year and a half, but it has been my choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; anxiousness?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have an anxious child, but I myself am anxious.  Mostly, I think the<br/>\nkey is to support them and let them be themselves.  I know that I have<br/>\nanxious feelings, but they are not so bad now that I give myself permission<br/>\nto have them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nWife to Roger (nearly 10 years)<br/>\nMum to Marti (7) and Lilly (4)<br/>\nBabysitter to Stella (3)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Real luxury is time and opportunity to read for pleasure&quot;<br/>\n-Jane Brody<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":317855850,"authorName":"carle dehning","from":"&quot;carle dehning&quot; &lt;dehningc@...&gt;","profile":"carledehning","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Need help with unschooling!","postDate":"1198743345","msgId":28651,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxZjA4YTc5MDcxMjI3MDAxNXI3MDg5MTI5OG5mNTc2YTI4NWRiMDUwNjY2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28638,"nextInTopic":28658,"prevInTime":28650,"nextInTime":28652,"topicId":28625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for this Lisa, My son Thomas [5]is the same, he is very aware of his comfort-zone .

Their personalities are<br/>\ndifferent from yours perhaps but they are really FINE!   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have observed one friend that perceives her child&#39;s shyness as being<br/>\nbroken... she has pushed this child, humiliated her in front of<br/>\neveryone numerous times (you freak why can&#39;t you play with other kids<br/>\nwhat&#39;s wrong with you??...YES she has said this outloud!)  and many<br/>\nother extremely damaging things that I feel have led to this child<br/>\nhaving serious issues with anxiety and depression(some of you have<br/>\nheard my stories about this child here before..she&#39;s sadly my best<br/>\nexample of the damage adults to to children!)  When she is with us and<br/>\nfeels safe she&#39;s the most engaging, enjoyable child you will meet!  <br/>\nShe&#39;s funny and so exquisitely bright!   At her house she skulks<br/>\naround trying to be invisible hoping that no one will engage with her<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s always negative!   Her mother will sign her up for things<br/>\nand literally just drop her off at the door causing her to have a<br/>\ncomplete panic attack!  She thinks that&#39;s the way to CURE shyness!<br/>\n   <br/>\nOn the other hand I have a friend who has a son that is very shy... he<br/>\ndoes attend traditional schools (small private school which is a good<br/>\nfit for him) she discusses with him what activities are available and<br/>\nwhether he would like to attend, she tries to coordinate with other<br/>\nparents so that there will be a child in the class etc that he knows<br/>\nso he will feel a bit more comfortable... she sits in the hallway or<br/>\nlobby quietly reading a book in case the activity doesn&#39;t work out he<br/>\nknows he can leave(which he rarely does)  When he wants to try out<br/>\nsomething that is a lesson or commitment type thing they always<br/>\narrange a trial lesson period so he can determine whether it&#39;s a good<br/>\nfit.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me this is such a wonderful way to allow kids to listen to their<br/>\ninner voices and know how to avoid getting stuck in something that is<br/>\na bad fit.    There are no lectures about money spent or time wasted<br/>\nor his obligation to the &quot;team&quot; etc.   He is the most responsible kid<br/>\nyou will meet... he doesn&#39;t use his freedom as a cop out as lots of<br/>\npeople have told his mother she is training him to do by allowing him<br/>\nso much say over his own life!   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I just wanted to have my little soap box moment here about the<br/>\nwhole shyness thing... people don&#39;t HAVE to hang out in groups of<br/>\npeople to be &quot;normal&quot; some people never feel comfortable in that<br/>\narena, some people are very happy to be somewhat solitary.   <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Need help with unschooling!","postDate":"1198471770","msgId":28634,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcxMjIzMjA0OXM2NjAxZTJkZnU3MjY1ZTA5OWU2ODc0ZjM3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZrbjMzYSsyaTQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZramsxcitndGlnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZmtuMzNhKzJpNDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28633,"nextInTopic":28635,"prevInTime":28633,"nextInTime":28635,"topicId":28625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have two<br/>\ngirls, eight and ten years old. After reading everything that I could<br/>\nget my hands on about homeschooling, it is the unschooling philosophy<br/>\nwhich has really appealed to me, and which I am trying to follow in my<br/>\nhome. However, I am getting a lot of pressure from my husband to &quot;do<br/>\nmore&quot; with my kids. My ten year old was very damaged by school, in my<br/>\neyes. She was not successful, and I feel that school ultimately did a<br/>\nlot to destroy her self-esteem. With both children, I can remember<br/>\nthem coming home and not wanting to do anything (other than veg out in<br/>\nfront of the TV, which they were not allowed to do). They rarely<br/>\nasked questions, and they were not very imaginative at all. However,<br/>\nsince they have been home, they have turned into different children -<br/>\nthey are happy, affectionate, curious, and incredibly imaginative. <br/>\nThey can spend hours playing with their Polly Pockets, and they spend<br/>\nhours reading for pleasure. This is how they mainly spend their days.<br/>\nThey get sidetracked by other things; for example, my older daughter<br/>\nbecame fascinated with Star Wars, which led to curiosity about how the<br/>\nmovie was filmed, which led to watching documentaries about how the<br/>\nmovies were made. They are very busy with their play and reading (and<br/>\nI am fine right now with all they are doing, and recognize what they<br/>\nare getting out of it all), but, at the same time, the kids are very<br/>\nresistant if I try to get them interested in other activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is not happy with this. He wants me to &quot;teach&quot; them more,<br/>\nor at least, have them do projects and experiments. However, the kids<br/>\nare not cooperative with this idea at all. After reading everything<br/>\nthat I have read about unschooling and homeschooling, and having been<br/>\na teacher for over 10 years, I am fairly confident that they are still<br/>\nin the &quot;deschooling&quot; stage, and I believe that in time they will<br/>\nbranch away from their intense &quot;play&quot; (which I feel is good for them<br/>\nright now), and explore other areas of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>\nlove to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me. How<br/>\nold were your children when you took them out of school? Do you<br/>\ndevelop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your own,<br/>\netc.), and, if so, how do they take to this? Do you make them learn<br/>\nabout certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>\ninterests? Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so? Are your<br/>\nchildren resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it? <br/>\nAre your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>\nIf you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>\nconcern you? What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>\nshyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it? If you<br/>\nhave an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>\nanxiousness?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - right<br/>\nnow, I need all the help I can get! <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nMichele<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?

It&#39;s<br/>\nnice to get confirmation of what I felt in my heart was the way to<br/>\napproach my children - following their lead, sharing my interests and<br/>\nobservations with them, letting them grow at their own speed.  I see<br/>\ntheir progress, and I see all that they are learning and doing during<br/>\nthe day.  My husband, on the other hand, isn&#39;t around to see it, and<br/>\non top of that has people constantly asking him how the homeschooling<br/>\nis going - and has no good response for them (in his eyes).  I have<br/>\nhad many conversations with him about all that we are doing, and I<br/>\nthink that he partially understands.  I think one of the biggest<br/>\nissues for him is that he is so used to traditional education, and all<br/>\nof the very clearly defined measurements of what students are being<br/>\ntaught, that it is very scary for him to have the kids home in a<br/>\nsituation where there are very few measurements of what they are being<br/>\ntaught.  He has trouble viewing it from the standpoint of looking at<br/>\nwhat they are learning!  He wants to see me doing &quot;projects&quot; with<br/>\nthem, but I know that the kids will recognize the projects as an<br/>\nattempt to &quot;teach&quot; them and they will completely rebel.  I&#39;ve decided<br/>\nto try keeping a journal/list of what the kids do and learn every day,<br/>\nso that hopefully I can come up with enough &quot;evidence&quot; that they are<br/>\nbeing exposed to a variety of concepts and ideas to please him.  In<br/>\naddition, I do realize that I need to educate him more about<br/>\nunschooling.  I have asked him to read material about unschooling and<br/>\nrelaxed homeschooling, but he so far has not done so (he really<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to read).  So, I think I will just pull a bunch of<br/>\nrelevant material and simply start reading it aloud to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thank you for all of your responses.

If you<br/>\nhave an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>\nanxiousness?<br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n <br/>\nMy children have never been in school so I cannot answer your first question. I can answer many of the other questions, however. I do introduce ideas and concepts all the time, usually in conversation about something else, or while watching television. It isn&#39;t really me thinking about introducing an idea or a concept, however, it&#39;s just about having a conversation. It is a bad thing to turn the introduction of concepts and ideas into teaching moments. Y&#39;know, when you see something cool and you frame it into a mini-lesson and suddenly it becomes less cool. When I see something cool, I share it. Like the other day when a kitten was sleeping in the cat tower with her head sticking out of the hole hanging down, I shared that. I didn&#39;t talk about the potentially beneficial nature of letting blood flow to your brain or anything else, it was cute moment that I wanted to share. Seeking things out that they like, like the kitten moment, means that they trust<br/>\n that I can find interesting things. I&#39;ve found Potterpuppetpals.com for them and shared and homestarrunner.com and the other day Mystery Science Theater 3000 and they enjoy all those kinds of things, so that kind of sharing, that kind of opening up their vistas of the world, means that they trust when I suggest going to do something, or watching something on-line, or playing a certain game, they trust me and they are willing to give it a go. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat isn&#39;t always true. Simon often doesn&#39;t like to go out to do new things. Or to meet new people in groups. That can be really hard. If he knows a friend will be there, he is absolutely open to it, but if it is a group event with no one that he knows it is almost always a no go. There are times that means that we don&#39;t go and do something, there are  times that means that David and Linnaea will go while Simon and I stay home. It depends on the thing, on the situation. Sometimes he will go along and bring something else to do, a game, a DVD, a book, something so that he has an out if he doesn&#39;t want to be involved in the activity. There are many options that are offered when someone wants to go and someone doesn&#39;t. So, what I do with a shy child is to help him be shy. If he wants to stay home rather than do some group activity, we stay home; if he wants to go, but gets overwhelmed when there I tend to hang back with him, or play openly with him hoping<br/>\n that my boldness will balance his shyness somehow. Forcing him to face up to being shy makes it harder, makes him more shy, less comfortable with himself. I don&#39;t think it would do anything but make him less willing to go places. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that my relatives are supportive of what we do, but they are supportive of me and of David. We don&#39;t live anywhere near family. We live in the UK and my family are in Boston, Minnesota and L.A. and David&#39;s family are in Brisbane, Australia (well, his brother lives in the UK but we see him about once a year). My mom is pretty supportive, actually, my dad (they are divorced) doesn&#39;t like what we do, but he likes the kids, and he likes David and me, so it isn&#39;t a big point of contention. I think I&#39;m quite good at keeping people from confronting me more than once. Not necessarily a good way to open communication, but it tends to keep people from offering too much advice or many opinions counter to my own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is important for you to see your children as recovering from school. I think it is probably helpful if you can help your husband to see them that way as well. Is he around much, or mainly evenings and weekends? If not it might help if you take pictures of what they are doing and e-mail them to him. Let him see them exploring the science of movie magic and reading and creating Polly Pocket tableaux, share their days with him. Talk to him about how they are learning to explore the world all over again, how the curiousity that school robbed from them has to be allowed to grow and blossom in its own terms and in its own time. It is a big thing to be acclimated to learning to someone else&#39;s time table and expectations. Now they are free from those things, help him to see how recreating the same thing will only stunt their growth. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":299004515,"authorName":"Joni Zander","from":"&quot;Joni Zander&quot; &lt;photoceo@...&gt;","profile":"galavantersjoy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Need help with unschooling!","postDate":"1198441346","msgId":28630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM3Y2NkNTBjMDcxMjIzMTIyMmg3Zjk4YWRiZGg3MWQ2MDEyYjM4MDJhMmZhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28628,"nextInTopic":28631,"prevInTime":28629,"nextInTime":28631,"topicId":28625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would love to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me.

How<br/>\nold were your children when you took them out of school?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest (now 15) had just finished 1st grade when we chose to unschool.<br/>\nMy youngest (now 11) had done one year of a co-op preschool.  (The day we<br/>\nstarted unschooling was the day she stopped taking naps - not wanting to<br/>\nmiss her older sis being around!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n========<br/>\nDo you develop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your<br/>\nown,<br/>\netc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe generally develop activities together.  We live as cooperatively as<br/>\npossible.  If they want me to put something together for them, I try to do<br/>\nso, with as much input as they care to give.  If they have something they<br/>\nwant to do, I try to make that happen with as much or as little help as they<br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\nDo you make them learn about certain things, or do you completely let them<br/>\nfollow their own<br/>\ninterests?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is mostly a matter of semantics, but adjusting the words you use will<br/>\nhelp you get the concepts, so: I&#39;m not sure how you would MAKE anyone learn<br/>\nanything, so, no, we don&#39;t make them learn about certain things.  But we<br/>\nalso don&#39;t wait around for them to show an interest in something, either.<br/>\nWe approach it more like you would with a friend - sharing things we find<br/>\ninteresting, but having no attachment to whether they are interested in what<br/>\nwe share.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe view learning differently than schools do.  Learning is what happens when<br/>\nyou are engaged in an interest, not a result of someone teaching something<br/>\n(although every once in a while learning can happen when someone is teaching<br/>\nsomething, but only if the learner is interested and engaged in the<br/>\ninformation).  Our kids own all their own learning because they&#39;ve come to<br/>\nit on their own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n============<br/>\nDo you try to expose your children to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, but not as a teacher would.  More as a friend would.  If I&#39;m doing<br/>\nsomething I am interested in, the kids are always welcome to join in, and I<br/>\ntry to always mention what I&#39;m working on and invite them to join me.  But I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any idea one way or the other about whether they will or should<br/>\njoin me - there is no attachment there on my part at all.  I also try not to<br/>\nassume that if they didn&#39;t want to join me in it last time or 10 times ago,<br/>\nthat they won&#39;t change their mind this time and want to join in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, there aren&#39;t things I think they should be exposed to.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t try to contrive interest in something because I think my kids should<br/>\nbe exposed to it.  It is all genuine for me - what I&#39;m interested in and<br/>\ninvite them to join me.  If I find something that I think they might be<br/>\ninterested in, I&#39;ll let them know about it and see if they want to do<br/>\nwhatever it is, but again, I have no attachment to it - they can say no<br/>\nthanks just as easily as yes with no judgment from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\nAre your children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, sometimes.  And often it seems like they are more receptive if a<br/>\nfriend suggests something new than if I do.  If they aren&#39;t interested then<br/>\nno big deal.  If there is something that they were interested in yesterday,<br/>\nbut not today, still no big deal.  And the other way around, if they weren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested in something yesterday, but they are today then we try to make it<br/>\nhappen.  They are completely free to choose all the time, just as I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\nAre your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome are (some are even unschoolers themselves), some aren&#39;t.  We are pretty<br/>\nconfident in what we are doing and have been most of the time, so it hasn&#39;t<br/>\nbeen a big deal.  I really think people pick up on your confidence or lack<br/>\nthere of more than on what you are doing.  I&#39;m guessing that since you were<br/>\na teacher, you will get less grief than most unschoolers because they think<br/>\nyou are more qualified (even though we know it really doesn&#39;t make any<br/>\ndifference).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\nIf you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>\nconcern you?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are both watchers.  They don&#39;t jump into things right away but stand<br/>\non the sidelines figuring stuff out first.  This is part of their learning<br/>\non their own terms.  So no, it doesn&#39;t concern me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n================<br/>\nWhat do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>\nshyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a shy child, I think the best thing you can do is model interactions<br/>\nfor them.  For example, someone comes over to introduce your child to<br/>\ntheirs.  Rather than trying to get your child to interact, give them a<br/>\nsecond to choose to interact and then interact for them.  You can start<br/>\ntalking to the new child, asking her getting to know you kinds of questions<br/>\nwhile giving your child the space to not be so uncomfortable - shifting the<br/>\nfocus from your child hiding behind you to the new child who has just been<br/>\nintroduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I wouldn&#39;t do and talk about how shy your child is - there is no need<br/>\nto label your child, because I&#39;m sure that sometimes she is shy and<br/>\nsometimes she is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy taking the pressure to talk to others off your child, you give her the<br/>\nspace to figure it all out.  When you focus on the problem of being shy, she<br/>\nfocuses on being shy and thinking something is wrong with her that needs to<br/>\nbe fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother common interaction where I notice kids being shy and not wanting to<br/>\nbe in the spotlight is when they or someone else is leaving.  I see so many<br/>\nparents tell their kids what to say as they are leaving (&quot;Say thank you for<br/>\nhaving me.&quot; or &quot;What do you say?&quot;) without even giving the kid a chance to<br/>\ncome up with it on his own.  I find it much more respectful for the parent<br/>\nto just say whatever it is directly to the other person.  This takes the<br/>\nspotlight off the kid long enough for them to choose whether they want to<br/>\nparticipate in the expected niceties or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I&#39;m trying to say, in a very round about way, is to take the<br/>\nspotlight off your kid as much as you can so they can come out of their<br/>\nshyness on their own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\nIf you have an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>\nanxiousness?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have an anxious child, but I would just support them in what they<br/>\nneed help dealing with - making their world as comfortable for them as they<br/>\ncan so they can learn to do the same for themselves as they grow.  And just<br/>\nlike with a childing acting shy - take the spotlight off them as much as you<br/>\ncan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck - and keep those questions coming!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nJoni Zander<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:PhotoCEO@...\">PhotoCEO@...</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ChoosingFreedom@...\">ChoosingFreedom@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLife/Parent Coaching at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com\">http://choosingfreedomjoy.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nblogging at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com\">http://ajoyfuljourney.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"Nance Confer","from":"&quot;Nance Confer&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"nanceconfer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Need help with unschooling!","postDate":"1198422485","msgId":28628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTMwMWM4NDU3NSRhMDU4NzEyMCQ2NjAyYThjMEBsYXVuY2htb2RlbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDExOTg0MTg1NDguMzk1LjIxNjEyLm00NUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28627,"nextInTopic":28630,"prevInTime":28627,"nextInTime":28629,"topicId":28625,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"unschoolingbasicsWhat does your DH do with them?

Our role is to create a rich environment where  <br/>\nthere are plenty of things that *could* interest them and to help  <br/>\nthem reach what interest them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike schooling where the answer to &quot;Do you...&quot;/&quot;Should you...&quot;  <br/>\nquestions is &quot;What does the teacher want to achieve,&quot;, the answer  <br/>\nwith unschooling is &quot;It depends. What does the child want?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will like projects. Some won&#39;t. What do your kids like?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the answer in most cases is that the more the project feels  <br/>\nlike it&#39;s something important that the mom wants to get into the  <br/>\nchild, the more likely the child will pick up on that and feel  <br/>\nmanipulated into learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning, it&#39;s probably best to avoid projects!<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture getting an idea in your head that it would be fun to explore  <br/>\ncartoons from the beginning of film to the present day. But what if  <br/>\nyour kids weren&#39;t wildly enthusiastic? How authentic would it feel to  <br/>\npressure them?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you make them learn<br/>\n&gt; about certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>\n&gt; interests?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>School leads us to believe that we need the skills before we can do  <br/>\nsomething. Real life is actually the opposite. We do things and pick  <br/>\nthe skills up as a side effect because we&#39;re interested in doing the  <br/>\nthing that interests us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids don&#39;t learn English because we teach them. They learn English as  <br/>\na side effect of trying to get what they want. They find words are  <br/>\nmore effective than crying. The more effective a tool is, the more  <br/>\noften they pick it up. The more often they pick it up, the better  <br/>\nthey get at it. No child ever decides to get better at English. It  <br/>\njust happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with math for an unschooling child. The world is full of number  <br/>\nmanipulation. Kids want information about something that interests  <br/>\nthem and sometimes they&#39;ll need to manipulate  numbers to get it. As  <br/>\na side effect they figure out how numbers work. Lots of my daughter&#39;s  <br/>\nearly number exposure was in video games, asking questions about how  <br/>\nlong until an event, making her own decisions on how to spend her  <br/>\nmoney, art software.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>\n&gt; ideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow depends on the child. Treat new ideas like comic books. How would  <br/>\nyou introduce your child to a new comic book or cartoon? How would  <br/>\nyou react if they shrugged their shoulders and didn&#39;t even want to  <br/>\nlook? What if they tried it and didn&#39;t like it? How would you react?  <br/>\nNot everything we try is going to be met with enthusiasm. Often it  <br/>\nhelps to just leave things out so that kids can pick them up when  <br/>\nthey want. Keep those things rotated with new things. (It&#39;s called  <br/>\nstrewing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often parents get the idea that the child needs to do x to get y  <br/>\ninto them and they feel an internal pressure to get the child to do  <br/>\nsomething because their future base of knowledge depends on it. But  <br/>\nin real life, everything is connected to everything. There isn&#39;t just  <br/>\none way  or one opportunity to be exposed to addition or Columbus or  <br/>\nShakespeare. Is there one way to be exposed to Superman or the Eiffel  <br/>\nTower or the Spanish language? In a rich environment they will  <br/>\nencounter things dozens and dozens of times, picking up a little more  <br/>\neach time, building a bigger, more accurate picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Are your<br/>\n&gt; children resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>\n&gt; ideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You back off. There are a billion ideas/concepts/activities in the  <br/>\nworld. If they turn one down, that leaves 999,999,999,999 more for  <br/>\nthem to explore. Putting pressure on them to learn or do one  <br/>\nparticular thing means you&#39;re in the way of them doing one of the  <br/>\nother 999,999,999,999 things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Are your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mostly, but mostly because they aren&#39;t pushy types and I&#39;ve never  <br/>\ntried to get them to understand what exactly we do. I think the less  <br/>\nthey&#39;re told the details, the more vague but enthusiastic you are,  <br/>\nthe better. Relatives worry. You don&#39;t need a daily break down to  <br/>\nsoothe the worry. Enthusiasm and confidence go a long way.  <br/>\n&quot;Everything&#39;s going great!&quot; is good. &quot;We&#39;ll keep doing this until it  <br/>\nstops working.

It just increases the shyness and feelings of  <br/>\ndiscomfort and inadequacy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a child who is shy or introverted or low on Gardner&#39;s  <br/>\ninterpersonal intelligence scale, social &quot;language&quot; is like a foreign  <br/>\nlanguage. Social kids pick the language up easy just like some kids  <br/>\npick up spoken languages easily. Kids on the other end of the  <br/>\nspectrum don&#39;t pick it up easily.

Support them in going at their own pace.  <br/>\nGive them opportunities to interact but accept the pace they choose  <br/>\nto go at. If you take them to an unschooling park day and they won&#39;t  <br/>\nleave your side, don&#39;t see that as what will happen for the rest of  <br/>\ntheir lives.

I have two<br/>\ngirls, eight and ten years old.  After reading everything that I could<br/>\nget my hands on about homeschooling, it is the unschooling philosophy<br/>\nwhich has really appealed to me, and which I am trying to follow in my<br/>\nhome.  However, I am getting a lot of pressure from my husband to &quot;do<br/>\nmore&quot; with my kids.  My ten year old was very damaged by school, in my<br/>\neyes.  She was not successful, and I feel that school ultimately did a<br/>\nlot to destroy her self-esteem.  With both children, I can remember<br/>\nthem coming home and not wanting to do anything (other than veg out in<br/>\nfront of the TV, which they were not allowed to do).  They rarely<br/>\nasked questions, and they were not very imaginative at all.  However,<br/>\nsince they have been home, they have turned into different children -<br/>\nthey are happy, affectionate, curious, and incredibly imaginative. <br/>\nThey can spend hours playing with their Polly Pockets, and they spend<br/>\nhours reading for pleasure.  This is how they mainly spend their days.<br/>\n They get sidetracked by other things; for example, my older daughter<br/>\nbecame fascinated with Star Wars, which led to curiosity about how the<br/>\nmovie was filmed, which led to watching documentaries about how the<br/>\nmovies were made.  They are very busy with their play and reading (and<br/>\nI am fine right now with all they are doing, and recognize what they<br/>\nare getting out of it all), but, at the same time, the kids are very<br/>\nresistant if I try to get them interested in other activities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is not happy with this.  He wants me to &quot;teach&quot; them more,<br/>\nor at least, have them do projects and experiments.  However, the kids<br/>\nare not cooperative with this idea at all.  After reading everything<br/>\nthat I have read about unschooling and homeschooling, and having been<br/>\na teacher for over 10 years, I am fairly confident that they are still<br/>\nin the &quot;deschooling&quot; stage, and I believe that in time they will<br/>\nbranch away from their intense &quot;play&quot; (which I feel is good for them<br/>\nright now), and explore other areas of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have several questions that I hope someone (many people - I would<br/>\nlove to hear lots of opinions) would be willing to answer for me.  How<br/>\nold were your children when you took them out of school?  Do you<br/>\ndevelop activities/projects for them (with their help, or on your own,<br/>\netc.), and, if so, how do they take to this?  Do you make them learn<br/>\nabout certain things, or do you completely let them follow their own<br/>\ninterests?  Do you try to expose your children to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activites, and, if so, how do you do so?  Are your<br/>\nchildren resistant when you try to expose them to new<br/>\nideas/concepts/activities, and if they are, how do you deal with it? <br/>\nAre your relatives supportive, and if not, how do you deal with them?<br/>\n If you have a shy child, do social interactions, or lack thereof,<br/>\nconcern you?  What do you do to help your child overcome his or her<br/>\nshyness, or do you feel that he or she will simply outgrow it?  If you<br/>\nhave an anxious child, how do you help your child to deal with the<br/>\nanxiousness?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help or advice that you could give me would be appreciated - right<br/>\nnow, I need all the help I can get!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nMichele</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28623,"nextTopicId":28626}}
