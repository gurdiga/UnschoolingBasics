She <br/>\nhas been doing awesome with it.  I was joking with her, when she was <br/>\nplaying this, and said, I thought math was hard for you, and she <br/>\ntold me it was, until she was playing this.  It&#39;s not only fun for <br/>\nmultiplication, but also gives some really cool info about the <br/>\nplanets, etc.  Yes, I know I said the M word (math), and I know that <br/>\nyou guys probably call it a schooly term, so I&#39;m sorry if I offend <br/>\nanyone, but for us in this house, it is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong story short, thanks to whoever posted about multiflyer.com.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s alot of fun, and my daughter is learning, and having fun with <br/>\nmath.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHAPPY HALLOWEEN TO EVERYONE!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Vanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18595,"nextTopicId":18610}}
