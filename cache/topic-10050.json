The regular classes<br/>\nwere expensive and not at a convenient time so she<br/>\narranged to not only have a homeschool class so that<br/>\nthe class would be at a convenient time and  her<br/>\ndaughter could be around other homeschoolers, she also<br/>\narranged for the parents to act as volunteers. We each<br/>\ntook one turn as parent volunteer per session. We<br/>\nbasically acted as &quot;crowd control&quot; to help keep the<br/>\nlittle ones from crashing or running over one another<br/>\nwhile on the floor and never did anything &quot;teachy&quot;,<br/>\nbut it kept them from having to hire another teacher<br/>\nfor the session and they passed that savings on to us.<br/>\nWe paid A LOT less for that class than we would have<br/>\nfor a regular class and it&#39;s a good thing too because<br/>\notherwise my son would never have enjoyed several<br/>\nyears worth of gymnastics while we were on a tight<br/>\nbudget. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also taken lots of &quot;classes&quot; through the local<br/>\nparks departments and the libraries. I even took a<br/>\nwhole series of VERY inexpensive classes at our local<br/>\nlibrary during which I had several months worth of<br/>\ntap, jazz, ballet, bellydance, and yoga classes.<br/>\nAfterwards the teachers offered continuing  classes at<br/>\na discount to the people who took the class. I&#39;d also<br/>\nsuggest that you ask around at local homeschooling<br/>\ngroups. We live in a small town but in our local group<br/>\nwe have a wealth of moms who are experienced in<br/>\nvarious things. We have an artist, a former gymnastics<br/>\ncoach, a scientist, an archeologist, a professional<br/>\nmusician, and more...and those are just the moms. We<br/>\nalso have lots of parents and kids who have<br/>\ninteresting hobbies and are willing to share their<br/>\nknowledge for free. And don&#39;t overlook other kids who<br/>\nare taking those things your daughter is interested<br/>\nin. Even though I wanted to, I never got to take a<br/>\ngymnastics class or a dance class when I was a kid<br/>\n(though I did when I got older), yet I was a<br/>\ncheerleader and was on the dance squad/flag corps in<br/>\nhigh school. I learned most of what I learned by<br/>\nhanging out with my friends who did get to take those<br/>\nclasses and having them show me what they learned! I<br/>\nalso second the video suggestion but add that most<br/>\nlibraries will primarily have beginner videos. If you<br/>\nlook online or in trade magazines you will find<br/>\nsources for more in depth videos. For instance, look<br/>\nhere:     <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.activevideos.com/gymnastics.htm\">http://www.activevideos.com/gymnastics.htm</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.i-needtoknow.com/gymnastics/videos.html\">http://www.i-needtoknow.com/gymnastics/videos.html</a> You<br/>\ncan also find discount gymnastics equipment and more. <br/>\n<br/>\nGotta&#39; go!

Science experiments, sewing, cooking, yoga, construction, <br/>\ngardening, art, etc.  Sometimes older homeschool kids can take turns sharing <br/>\ntheir knowledge with those interested. Auto repair, sports (basketball, archery, <br/>\nsoccer), robot building, book clubs, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren&#39;t successful putting that together I suggest you shop around for <br/>\nclasses that fit within your budget.  Where there is a will, you can find a <br/>\nway.  Fees vary a lot, for example: In our community there is a gymnastics <br/>\nstudio that charges by the season and you pay an annual registration fee of <br/>\n50.00/student as well as 15.00 per class and they require full payment in advance of <br/>\nthe session.  For two of my kids it cost us $460.00 initially.  Too much.  The <br/>\nstudio we go to now is run by a family friendly mom.  She charges a $25.00 <br/>\nannual family registration, 10.00 per class and offers a 10%sibling discount.  <br/>\nIt costs us 72.00 per month, payable monthly, for our two Olympic bound <br/>\ngymnasts.  Other classes we take, like piano, accept payment on a weekly basis.  We <br/>\nhave a soup and grilled cheese night once a week and save enough for a $10.00 <br/>\nclass.  Brainstorm and you will find a way to do many of the things your <br/>\nchildren are interested in.  We have also had great success by gathering a group of <br/>\ninterested students and presenting yourselves to a business as a &quot;class&quot; <br/>\nlooking for an instructor.  You can negotiate for reasonable rates and we have <br/>\nfound that few businesses turn down 8-10 paying students.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDrama classes at a conservatory can be expensive but you may be able to find <br/>\na talented homeschooler who is willing to work with you to put a play or <br/>\ntalent show together.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrioritize...Cut expenses where you can, i.e., cable, food, heat, etc., or <br/>\nclean your cellar and attic and have a yard sale or sell stuff on e-bay.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the above ideas are overwhelming, design a gymnastics circuit in your <br/>\nhome.  Climb over couches, balance on benches, crawl under tables, etc.  Hold your <br/>\nown creative movement class and play music and stretch, dance and move <br/>\ntogether.  The possibilities are endless.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nRobin in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":176850845,"authorName":"mother_bhaer","from":"&quot;mother_bhaer&quot; &lt;Kent_Terri@...&gt;","profile":"mother_bhaer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: price of interests...","postDate":"1140388955","msgId":10053,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0YXM4cis5MXFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGR0YXBoZCtlaWFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10050,"nextInTopic":10054,"prevInTime":10052,"nextInTime":10054,"topicId":10050,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i would love to get them into gymnastics class or ... talented ...
