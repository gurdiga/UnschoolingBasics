From this side of<br/>\nthe fence, where my children are freely and happily learning everyday<br/>\nin the real world, it can be maddening to read this sort of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s good to keep in mind that the NEA operates as a union. Last<br/>\nyear they had an operating budget of around $310 million.

One of their taglines is<br/>\n&quot;Building great public schools for every child.&quot; Note the phrase in<br/>\nthe homeschooling resolution about &quot;all expenses should be borne by<br/>\nthe parents&quot;. What does this have to do with the well being of<br/>\nchildren? Nothing - but they don&#39;t want state or federal money that<br/>\ncould be funneled into their industry somehow ending up in our<br/>\npockets.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the NEA website:<br/>\n* * * NEA exists to improve the quality of public education and serve<br/>\nthe needs of its members. The two go hand-in-hand. The Association<br/>\nknows that the quality of education our teachers deliver is linked to<br/>\ntheir working conditions. NEA seeks to enhance the professionalism of<br/>\neducation employees by providing them with opportunities to develop<br/>\ntheir skills and improve their teaching techniques. NEA also advocates<br/>\nfor the kind of employment rights, economic benefits and working<br/>\nconditions that they as professionals deserve. For this reason, NEA<br/>\nspends a comparable amount of money advocating for qualified teachers<br/>\nin every classroom, improving reading skills, promoting school<br/>\nconstruction and modernization, building bipartisan support for public<br/>\neducation and advocating for safe and orderly schools. * * *<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can see how homeschoolers - especially happy, successful<br/>\nhomeschoolers who are achieving that success without state-mandated<br/>\ncurriculums and teacher oversight - can be perceived as threatening to<br/>\ntheir livelihood. What if the word got out that learning is *natural*<br/>\nand inevitable? What if more parents realized their children can<br/>\nthrive without classrooms?

I also appreciate the information on homeschooling and  <br/>\nthe National Home Education Network.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Association is very concerned about the education and well-being  <br/>\nof all children, and works to ensure that they are taught in an  <br/>\nenvironment conducive to effective learning. The NEA Representative  <br/>\nAssembly, made up of 9,000 delegates who represent the 2.6 million  <br/>\nmembers throughout the country, is the Association&#39;s primary policy- <br/>\nmaking body. This body thoroughly discusses and debates every  <br/>\nproposed policy before voting to approve or reject it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the 1998 RA, delegates approved the policy on homeschooling.  <br/>\nThey were concerned that homeschooled students were not provided a  <br/>\ncomprehensive education experience because they did not have an  <br/>\nopportunity to interact with students of different cultures, economic  <br/>\nstatus, or learning styles. They felt homeschooled students learned  <br/>\nin a setting primarily made up [of] family members and friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know that parental involvement is imperative for school  <br/>\nachievement, but delegates were concerned that home schools were not  <br/>\nrequired to use state-approved curricula. They agreed that  <br/>\nhomeschooled students have done well on national tests and were the  <br/>\ntop spellers in the National Spelling Bee two years ago, but felt  <br/>\nhome school instruction should meet certain state education standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are some of the reasons delegates approved the 1998 resolution  <br/>\non homeschooling, and reconfirmed their position at the 2000 annual  <br/>\nmeeting. Members who want this policy reviewed may submit a proposal  <br/>\nto the Resolutions Committee for presentation at the RA.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again for your comments and the materials on homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\n<br/>\nBob Chase<br/>\nPresident<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":27314618,"authorName":"Genevieve","from":"&quot;Genevieve&quot; &lt;katgrl705@...&gt;","profile":"katgrl705","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"2007-2008 proposals  NEA","postDate":"1190470699","msgId":26434,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZkMzg3Yis0YjI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26438,"prevInTime":26433,"nextInTime":26435,"topicId":26434,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For those who do not know in the 2007-2008 proposals the NEA states that homeschooling doesn t really work!
