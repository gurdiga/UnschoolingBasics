They want to go no go farther, think no harder or differently.  Whether you do or don&#39;t is not the point. It this case it is not meant to be all about you.  <br/>\nThere are lots of people on this list reading this dialogue. <br/>\nI am willing to bet that everyone on this list has said &quot;NO&quot; sometimes.  <br/>\nWe can admit that and say we are &quot;not perfect&quot; but once again that is not the point.<br/>\nThe point is in every instance we are hopefully trying to find another way, and that we learn from our &#39;less than perfect&quot; days.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnips from Maura&#39;s post<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n...and the other thing is, in one way or another I see that eventually I would have to restrict <br/>\nhim, or whatever you wanna call it.  And I&#39;m not unwilling to not restrict him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I just, with every scenario I imagine, or people suggest, I still see me ultimately having <br/>\nto control the situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m <br/>\nunwilling to try; I&#39;m just saying I still don&#39;t have confidence that it will work out. <br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nThe attitude is key here.  A bad paraphrased piece of some quote somewhere says<br/>\n&quot;if you think you can&#39;t...you can&#39;t... &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo decide that you can work it out and it will be better. Brain storm with your son, you family, your neighbors.<br/>\nYou have already started it here, so now take it farther and try to internalize the idea that<br/>\nyou are not doomed to some inevitable conclusion before you even start.<br/>\n<br/>\nPositive energy is a powerful tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth in MD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25266,"nextTopicId":25297}}
