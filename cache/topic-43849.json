That&#39;s a pretty normal understanding of learning, but it isn&#39;t a helpful understanding if you are unschooling. The underlying assumption with unschooling is that learning is a part of being human; we learn all the time. It happens best in an environment rich with engaging and interesting things to do, with happy and engaged individuals, but it happens without those things as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son isn&#39;t an avid reader. He didn&#39;t read with much proficiency until he was about 12 and at 13 he is a competent reader, but he doesn&#39;t read for pleasure, just for information. He really enjoys books, though. When he was younger he and I would curl up and I would read to him. I would read for as long as my voice would hold out. We checked books on tape out from the library and those readers lasted longer than I did, so he would alternate between my reading and a taped reader, at some point he didn&#39;t want me to read to him anymore. He wanted to do things, to move around while he listened to the books. He walks around most of the time with an ipod listening to some book or another. We watched I, Robot the other night on television and I talked about Isaac Asimov and three laws and how much I really enjoyed his books. Simon wanted to hear one, so I bought it from Itunes and he&#39;s loved it. It&#39;s the first collection of short stories that he&#39;s listened to,<br/>\n he said it was much better than the movie, and completely different. I got the first book of Isaac Asimov&#39;s Robot Series yesterday for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, on the other hand, loves to read. There are books piled up next to the bed and by the toilet and scattered here and there all through the house. Because of her enjoyment of the Warrior Cat series she has begun to write fan fiction. She writes mostly on a Roblox forum, but yesterday created a new cat character in Word. She often will draw pictures of the cats she&#39;s writing about as a reference, I suppose. She likes the visual to accompany the written. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither is more interested in learning than the other. Both have their own approaches and relationships with the world of books and stories. It&#39;s a bit harder for Simon because not everything is offered as a spoken word cd or mp3, but a lot is. They learn because they are living and interested and happy and engaged. The books Linnaea reads aren&#39;t books that appeal to me in the same way as the books that Simon reads. Does that mean that she is learning less? I don&#39;t think so. Simon isn&#39;t reading the books to himself, he isn&#39;t withdrawing from the rest of his day to become absorbed in a story, he does all that he would normally do accompanied by Stephen Fry or Jim Dale or Scott Brick or Green Day or Jonathon Coulton, or whoever else is coming through his headphones. Is he learning less? is he less engaged by what he is hearing than Linnaea is by what she is reading? I absolutely don&#39;t think so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read a lot for a long, long time. It was where I went to hide from the rest of the world. I read on the school bus, my knees braced against the seat in front of mine, ignoring all the things going on around me. I read in class, sneaking the book on my lap, behind a text book, in my desk using any excuse to open it. Books were my hideaway place. And I was praised for using them. When Simon was born and then Linnaea my time to read shrunk. At first I was really frustrated and then I started to realise how much I didn&#39;t want to escape. I like being right here right now, I don&#39;t need to escape somewhere else to have a good time. I didn&#39;t stop learning because I wasn&#39;t reading. I&#39;ve learned a lot in the past 13 years. And when I do read, I&#39;m much more selective in my reading. And I can put down a book without feeling torn from it. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is a byproduct of living. And if your kids are having a good time they&#39;ll be learning far more from what they are doing and engaging with than if they are being pressed by someone else to engage with the world in the prescribed manner. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: redsrandigene2 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:redsrandigene2@...\">redsrandigene2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 4 May, 2010 11:15:52<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling but difficulties<br/>\n<br/>\nI am noticing the interest in learning in 2 of my children but the other two show no interest. how do I get them motivated on anything besides tv or playing outside? my twothat are interested in learning were actually begging for book work the other night.but how do i get them all interested in reading?

Recognize that most videogames involve reading. We often use closed captioning so we don&#39;t have to crank up the TV volume when the windows are open in summer with fans going and cars driving by. That&#39;s reading. Realize that there are people who live successful lives who don&#39;t read for entertainment/enjoyment. There&#39;s a big difference between being able to read and choosing to read &quot;for fun&quot;. My DS was able to read pretty fluently by age 5 Â½. Once he had mastered the skill, he moved on and wasn&#39;t interested in reading books for about 5 years (he&#39;s now approaching 12...less than a month to go...and he is enjoying books again). In the interim, reading was still there - closed captions, videogames, game guides and walkthroughs, etc. And, we made sure that he had other resources as well, mostly magazines that were related to his interests (did you know that there&#39;s an entire magazine devoted to Pokemon?!) If he asked, we&#39;d read something for him (I got really good at using the printed Pokedex we purchased lol). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW he also learned to physically write and construct grammatical sentences/use punctuation/spell without us &#39;setting up&#39; penpals for him. He developed those skills/is developing those skills in his own time, his own way to meet his own goals and needs. If the kids wanted penpals, go for it. If that&#39;s a not-too-subtle &quot;lesson plan&quot;, maybe reconsider.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Writing and math and so  <br/>\non are a natural part of life. They don&#39;t need artificially brought in  <br/>\nto get kids to learn skills.
