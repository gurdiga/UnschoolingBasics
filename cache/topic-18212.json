Now we have a completely different <br/>\nlifestyle.  Now my hubby makes all the money and he has 6 months of <br/>\nvacation every year (he works 2 weeks on, has 2 weeks off).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me 2 years to fully de-work; I had been working everyday <br/>\nsince I was 14.

I quit a part-time teaching job I&#39;ve done for years  <br/>\nand hated more and more all the time. My partner and I decided that I  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go back next semester, but after we made that decision,  <br/>\ncontinuing became intolerable, and I asked my chair to replace me  <br/>\nimmediately. Which he did. (One of my friends said, &quot;I understand.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve had jobs that I couldn&#39;t let myself feel how much I hated them,  <br/>\nbecause I had to keep doing them. Once you decided to leave in  <br/>\nDecember, you couldn&#39;t keep pretending you didn&#39;t hate what you were  <br/>\ndoing, so you had to quit sooner.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy situation isn&#39;t quite like yours because I didn&#39;t provide the bulk  <br/>\nof our family&#39;s income, working from home only part-time. But I made  <br/>\na lot of money per hour, and I have anxiety about money, so even as  <br/>\nmy partner&#39;s income has increased, it has been hard for me to think  <br/>\nof giving up the &quot;extra&quot; money I was earning. Recently, when I was  <br/>\ntalking--yet again--about my job, my partner said to me, &quot;But when  <br/>\nyou say you make a lot per hour, you have to take into account how  <br/>\nyour job hangs over your head all the time...how much time you spend  <br/>\ntalking to me and friends about how much you hate it...how irritable  <br/>\nyou get...how it takes you away from being available to the kids even  <br/>\nwhen you&#39;re not actually working at that moment.&quot; Over the next few  <br/>\nweeks, I paid attention and realized he was right--doing the job  <br/>\naffected my mood and cast a pall over my life that extended far  <br/>\nbeyond the hours I spent doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has felt great to quit, though I&#39;m definitely de-working. This  <br/>\nweek, I just wanted to veg out and read instead of jumping in and  <br/>\ndoing all the things I was suddenly free to do, so I spent much of  <br/>\nthe week relaxing, letting the house go to hell, ordering take-out  <br/>\nfor dinner. I also felt able to say &quot;Yes&quot; to the kids a lot, and just  <br/>\nbe with them while they spent as much time at the park, the library,  <br/>\nor engaged in a project, as they wanted. Aaaahhh.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, my situation isn&#39;t analogous to yours--I earned about 1/8  <br/>\nof what my partner earns, and he just got a raise, so I don&#39;t _think_  <br/>\nleaving my job will require huge shifts in how we handle money, in  <br/>\nwhat we can and can&#39;t do, and so on. But it feels so good to have  <br/>\njust taken the plunge, to not keep thinking, &quot;I&#39;ll just do the job  <br/>\nfor a few more years until the car is paid off,&quot; or &quot;I can keep doing  <br/>\nthe job and put the money into savings! Won&#39;t that be great?&quot; For me,  <br/>\nit&#39;s tied up with anxiety about money, and I am also feeling that in  <br/>\nthis transition. But I expect it will be all to the good in the long  <br/>\nterm.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I also am thinking that leaving the job gives me the opportunity  <br/>\nto find other outlets for doing the parts of it I do like. I taught  <br/>\nrequired freshman composition classes to students who were poorly  <br/>\nprepared and didn&#39;t want to be there. Hellish! In the past, I have  <br/>\nled creative writing workshops and reading groups, which have allowed  <br/>\nme to facilitate groups of people who wanted to be there, practicing  <br/>\nthings they were interested in, outside the school system. I am  <br/>\nexcited to think about doing a reading group again, for instance. And  <br/>\nnext summer, if my proposal is accepted, I&#39;ll be leading a week-long  <br/>\n(3 hours/day) workshop on Walt Whitman&#39;s &quot;Song of Myself&quot; for  <br/>\nQuakers, something I might not have been able to do otherwise because  <br/>\nI usually have taught a summer class.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might broaden your question to, &quot;Has anyone ever just taken a  <br/>\nleap of faith?&quot; Has there been a time when you&#39;ve done that? (Having  <br/>\nbabies comes to mind for me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, who, God willing, will never again have to grade a 1000-word  <br/>\nessay on Secondhand Smoke, Euthanasia, or whether homeschooling  <br/>\nshould be legal &lt;g&gt;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: School and Work","postDate":"1160841161","msgId":18214,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVncjE0OSs5bzhuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMTQyMDA2MTUzNi4xMzI1Ny40NTMxMDQxQTAwMDBCMjk1MDAwMDMzQzkyMjAwNzUwMzMwOUIwRTA1MDE5RDA3MEVAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":18212,"nextInTopic":18215,"prevInTime":18213,"nextInTime":18215,"topicId":18212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Has anyone else quit a good job for uncertainty?~~ Oh my yes.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-121469851\">I am having some real issues with my JOB. Basically, I make a really good salary doing something I do for the paycheck, not because its my passion in life. I went to Public School and now I am employed in the Public Sector. I hated school and now I hate my job. But I have my good days because of my &quot;friends&quot; at work. Kind of like having friends at school. You feel part of a community and convince yourself you are making a difference in the world by doing your job. There are so many parallels I can see between what I am doing and going to school as a child. I show up every day and do my bit, and at this point I am not even clear what my passions are because my time mostly belongs to someone else and I have to think about what they pay me to think about, not what I want to think about. And right now I am at work not doing my job. I am emailing you all on the internet. <br/>\nOne day last year, after a particularly bad commute  my daughter had to stay in &quot;after school care&quot; way too long because I was late. She got into the car and started ragging on me for being late. I tried to explain to her that it was not my fault. She leaned her head against the window and said: &quot;I&#39;m just so unhappy. I HATE my school so much. I hate school.&quot; and I said &quot;I hate work.&quot; and then I looked at her and said: &quot;Lets quit.&quot; So....here she is deschooling and I am still working. (Fortunately her Dad is off work until January.) I tell her often that I want her to find her passions in life, but I am not exactly practicing what I preach. I feel like I need to &quot;dework.&quot; I am trying to set myself up financially for quitting, but it is taking time and I am so tempted to just quit and let the chips fall where they may. I also have some trepidation because I worked hard to get where I am and its nice to have a decent salary to afford things. I grew up poor and we lived paycheck to pay<br/>\ncheck before I went back into the work force. Has anyone else quit a &quot;good job&quot; for uncertainty?<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18166,"nextTopicId":18044}}
