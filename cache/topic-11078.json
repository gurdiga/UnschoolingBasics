We have a 4x4 box which means we have 16 squares in which to<br/>\ngrow things.  Each vegetable needs a certain amount of space depending on<br/>\nits needs.  For instance corn needs to be 1 foot apart, so it gets 1<br/>\nsquare.  Carrots OTOH need to be only 3&quot; apart, so we can have 16 carrot<br/>\nplants in each square.  Lettuce we can do four plants per square and<br/>\ncucumbers are 2 per square.  So we had to figure out what we wanted to grow,<br/>\nhow much we wanted to grow and how many squares we would need for each<br/>\nplant, taking into consideration that we want to do companion growing using<br/>\nmarigolds, nasturtiums and basil.  We aren&#39;t growing this garden because we<br/>\nwant to teach our children some lesson, be it math, horticulture, herbology,<br/>\nor even woodshop.  But in the process of reaching our goal of having fresh<br/>\norganic produce from our own backyard made by our own hands, we have to<br/>\nlearn some math (if we want 2 squares of carrots how many seeds are we going<br/>\nto need if we want to start with about 3 in each hole?), some horticulture<br/>\n(such as we don&#39;t want to grow corn right next to tomatoes and we need to<br/>\nfind the right sunlight for our yard and make sure that our mix for our box<br/>\nis right on), a bit of herbology (basil is good for the soup we want to make<br/>\nand lavender is calming), and a bit of woodshop (gotta build those boxes<br/>\nsomehow.)  But we don&#39;t think, &quot;Oh good.  The kids are going to learn some<br/>\nmath and science with this venture.&quot;  Our only thought is that we want a<br/>\ngarden and we have to all work through each step to get there.  The hardest<br/>\npart was figuring out how many bags of 4 quarts we would need to make up 3<br/>\ncubic feet of vermiculite!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have come to this comfortable place of unschooling by looking back and<br/>\nrealizing that our children WILL be able to find the skills that they need<br/>\nto be who they want to be.  They don&#39;t need all those skills now.  But as<br/>\nthey live their lives and reach out to their passions they will gain those<br/>\nskills out of necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCatch our new wave of color!<br/>\nBook a March show!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236679737,"authorName":"sixanders","from":"&quot;sixanders&quot; &lt;sixanders@...&gt;","profile":"sixanders","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"I&#39;m new and need some advice please","postDate":"1143415266","msgId":11078,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUwNzdsMitkYXY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11079,"prevInTime":11077,"nextInTime":11079,"topicId":11078,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello, I don t know where to start except to say that I m new to the thought of unschooling.
