I know I have found that  if <br/>\nthe other mom lets me do it, me talking to the child makes more of a  <br/>\ndifference than his own mom.<br/>\n <br/>\nAn example, I was visiting someone whose son was constantly picking and  <br/>\nhurting on my toddler.  His mom was doing her best, but getting  nowhere.  I <br/>\nfinally looked him in the eye and said &quot;don&#39;t hurt my baby&quot;  very kindly but firmly <br/>\nand he stopped.  I kept an eye on him afterwards,  letting him know I meant <br/>\nbusiness....this was *my* baby and he was not going to  hurt him!<br/>\n <br/>\nMaybe the mom will understand that you are not disciplining her son for  her, <br/>\nbut protecting your own child from getting hurt, and that perhaps that will  <br/>\ncome across more clearly to her son if *you* do it.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen, you can keep it simple.  Stay on him constantly until he  understands <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n <br/>\nBy the way, I had the child that was aggressive and physical, not mean, but  <br/>\ncould definitely hurt someone.  I always appreciated other moms that  <br/>\nunderstood this about my child.  They never shamed him, but sometimes they  got <br/>\nthrough to him better than I could.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Say,  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;","postDate":"1151731741","msgId":15191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY0NzZFRTE4LTk4RjctNEY2QS04NTRCLTdFQjM3RDgxMzgwREBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzAxMDE1NTE4Ljk1MTI3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMDA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzAxMDE1NTE4Ljk1MTI3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjMwMDA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15185,"nextInTopic":15198,"prevInTime":15190,"nextInTime":15192,"topicId":15094,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

His young helper <br/>\naccidentally blew some of the pellets into our *just resurfaced* pool. <br/>\nI mean, like--it was resurfaced the week before! The iron left small <br/>\nrust stains. Permanent stains.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I was perfectly within my legal rights to sue him for the $3500 it <br/>\nwould take to resurface the pool. Again. But it wasn&#39;t malicious. It <br/>\nwas an accident. I *know* Carroll felt horrible, and I know the young <br/>\nman who did it will *not* do it again. So others pools in the area are <br/>\nsafe! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  We agreed that he would cover a low-cost attempt to fix it without <br/>\ndraining and resurfacing. It didn&#39;t work---the spots faded for a few <br/>\ndays, but came back just as rusty. Carroll was willing to pay the whole <br/>\n$3500, but that was silly. I can live with the rust spots.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve made a good friend in Carroll too. He goes out of his way to make <br/>\nsure the lawn is healthy. (Not that he doesn&#39;t do that with everyone, <br/>\nbut we feel he makes a special effort with us now.) The goodwill we <br/>\nshare with our lawn care guy and the pool guy (he was shocked we didn&#39;t <br/>\nsue), is good enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The same with our kids. By not viewing them or their acts as <br/>\nmalicious, we gain their trust and respect---AND they do the same with <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think children&#39;s being treated as &quot;malicious perpetrators&quot; has <br/>\ncontributed to our litigious society and to the seemingly ridiculous <br/>\nneed to be blameless---or to blame someone else. No one wants to get in <br/>\ntrouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Accidents *happen*. They do. Often they hurt. Bad. But because we get <br/>\ninto so much trouble for accidents, we refuse to accept blame and be <br/>\ngenuinely apologetic. Easier to blame someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want.

Sometimes  the child <br/>\nwill be able to easily to say it.  Sometimes the child has no  intention <br/>\nwhatsoever of saying it and I let it go.  I might go say to the  injured party that <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry they got hurt.  And sometimes my child will  say &quot;I want you to say <br/>\nit with me&quot;.  So either I&#39;ll say the apology or give  my child the words to <br/>\nuse.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and it doesn&#39;t always happen right away.  Sometimes there is a lag  time <br/>\nbetween when I suggest it and when they feel OK about saying it.<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce I overheard a squabble between my kids and the five year old said, &quot;I  <br/>\nthink an apology would make me feel better&quot; and the older one said &quot;oh, I&#39;m  <br/>\nsorry....let me see if I can fix your toy I broke.&quot;  Sweet.

I&#39;ll look for the flames tomorrow (if the computer is smoking, I  <br/>\nwon&#39;t even touch the power button)<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to force my kids to apologize, and felt like a hypocrite every  <br/>\ntime. How many times did i screw up and say sorry only to shut the  <br/>\nother person up (or even worse &quot;Sorry, but...&quot;)? But then resent it  <br/>\nthe whole time? And stew?  And it wasn&#39;t (as someone mentioned  <br/>\nearlier) about honestly feeling regret, it was all a power play  <br/>\n(you&#39;ll say sorry because I said so, and I&#39;m saying so because I&#39;m  <br/>\nembarrassed at your actions and because those other people expect it)  <br/>\nYou&#39;re teaching that it&#39;s okay to do whatever you want, as long as  <br/>\nyou say sorry! There&#39;s no chance to develop actual remorse, because  <br/>\nsuddenly the focus is on the whole &#39;apology power&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my especial pet peeve, my friend, when someone apologizes to her  <br/>\nchildren, makes them say &quot;It&#39;s okay&quot;, when it obviously is not okay  <br/>\nto them, and they need some more time to grieve. :-( Talk about an  <br/>\nimmediate dismissal of emotions, devaluing someone&#39;s opinion, and  <br/>\nremoving power from them!  Breanna hits the girl sometimes out of  <br/>\nanger, and sometimes just for a reaction, and when her mom says that,  <br/>\ni say &quot;NO! It is NOT okay to be hit, and it hurts. I&#39;m sorry  <br/>\nElizabeth, that she did that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do still ask my kids if they would like to apologize, esp the  <br/>\nlittle ones. Mostly because I think they are not sure about what  <br/>\nsteps they can take to help someone feel better after a run-in. I  <br/>\nusually ask the older ones if they have any ideas on how they could  <br/>\nhelp someone...whether they were the &quot;perpetrator&quot; (for lack of a  <br/>\nbetter word) or not. I try to model a lot of compassion for the kids,  <br/>\nby hugging someone who has gotten hurt or had some toy taken, or some  <br/>\nother sadness, and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry that happened to you, what can I do  <br/>\nto help you feel better?&quot; Sometimes just the validation is enough for  <br/>\nthe kids &quot;I&#39;ll bet that was not good for you&quot;, can open the way for  <br/>\nthe perp, and sometimes it just helps the victim (so to speak) I  <br/>\nusually ask them &quot;Is it okay?&quot; or &quot;what can Joe do to make it up to  <br/>\nyou?&quot; to facilitate some discussion, since the boys are so young, and  <br/>\neven Rachel and Emily are still building their tools. Josh is just  <br/>\ngetting to the age where he has his tool chest filled and he can access.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have the power to say no, which Dan does about 20% of the time.  <br/>\nthe rest of the time, he&#39;ll say (or sign) that he&#39;s sorry, and offer  <br/>\nhelp. Most of the time the other kids do it on their own, although  <br/>\nthey have been known to say &quot;I&#39;m *NOT* sorry, you were being mean to  <br/>\nme and wouldn&#39;t stop&quot; And they also are free to say &quot;It&#39;s not okay,  <br/>\nwhat you did hurt me&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nack. It&#39;s late and I think I just had a brain leak. I hope this makes  <br/>\nsense....Good questions Kelly<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 29, 2006, at 11:50 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I figured I&#39;d bring this to its own thread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone want to approach the idea of forced apologies?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Open (and HOT!) topic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; Conference Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want.
