And you know what&#39;s REALLY interesting?! Is the  <br/>\nmore I unschool, the more sensitive he is and the more able and willing he is to <br/>\n speak UP and say the same things! He says, &quot;Don&#39;t yell at me!&quot; and even <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t  hurt me!&quot; (though I do NOT hit, spank, whatnot, they have seen me slam <br/>\nthings in  anger...a thing I have worked long an hard on and am doing QUITE well! <br/>\n:) )  which I think is wonderful - he is expressing himself so much better <br/>\nthan he  used to. Because he is HEARD now, is what I can get from these changes. <br/>\nAnd I am  so happy and grateful for that. My barometer, for sure! and to <br/>\nthink most  parents that new us thought I was a radical, laid back parent  <br/>\nBEFORE...lol...<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25580,"nextTopicId":25524}}
