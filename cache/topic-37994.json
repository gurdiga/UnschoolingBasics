Luke saw this guild doing  <br/>\nsome interesting things in the game, one of which was being very  <br/>\ngenerous and handing out bags freely in Brill.  I researched a bit of  <br/>\ninformation on them, and found out how he could join them, and I  <br/>\nfollowed shortly thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight we had in-game RP training, to learn more how to role play.   <br/>\nAnd we got homework!  :::laughing::::  I have more homework than  <br/>\nLuke, because he knows more of the WoW storyline.  I&#39;m supposed to  <br/>\nlook up some cinematics and stories of the game to learn about the  <br/>\nhistory in WoW, so I can create a believable character and play along  <br/>\nwith some of the set story line.<br/>\n<br/>\nA side note... the woman leading the training, which was all done in  <br/>\nthe chat box, said to excuse her misspellings, that her mod (extra  <br/>\ndownload modification) was not working.  So here&#39;s this incredible  <br/>\nrole player (she&#39;s been doing it for 9 years), who is not a good  <br/>\nspeller, but has found a way around it, to share her wealth of  <br/>\ninformation.  And, geez she was fast at typing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have some question to answer to create a background to our  <br/>\ncharacters, like &quot;Who am I?&quot;, &quot;Where am I from?&quot;, &quot;What have I done  <br/>\nin my life?&quot;, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are having so much fun in this guild, and I&#39;m enjoying playing and  <br/>\nsharing this with Luke.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Jill P in CO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37982,"nextTopicId":38014}}
