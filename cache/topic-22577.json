It has been (continues to be) a journey<br/>\n~ mostly about myself.  The biggest challenge has been reprogramming myself<br/>\nto stay in the moment and being aware of when it would be best to be<br/>\nphysically present or the potential of needing to be, as well as just being<br/>\nwith them more. I&#39;m also getting better at finding the core issues of<br/>\nsituations. It is so common to assume kids are doing things for attention.<br/>\nThat insinuates attention is not something that kids need and seems to<br/>\njustify being disconnected and detached. It is one of my pet peeves when<br/>\npeople assume kids are trying to be malicious for the sole joy of it. And<br/>\nyet I understand not knowing how to guide them (and myself) when also<br/>\nparented in the same manner. It has been difficult at times to ignore that<br/>\nvoice that reminds me of all the adult responsibilities I need to tend to.<br/>\nIt has taken me of out my comfort zones but I then remind myself what is<br/>\ntruly important to me. I&#39;m steadily outgrowing my tendency to take care of<br/>\nthings before people (including myself).  And the wonderful thing is that<br/>\nthe rewards come right now. I remind myself that I am consciously choosing<br/>\nto evolve and that change is only as hard as I make it. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Linda wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m hoping someone can recommend some good books to teach me what to do<br/>\n </span></blockquote>about my dd 11 and ds 9 being so cruel to each other in their daily<br/>\nconflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSome books & websites that have helped me are:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSiblings Without Rivalry<br/>\n<br/>\nBuddha never raised kids & Jesus didn&#39;t drive carpool (AWESOME BOOK)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.parentingwithsoul.com/\">http://www.parentingwithsoul.com/</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Indigo Children  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indigochild.com/readthis.html\">http://www.indigochild.com/readthis.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRaising an Emotionally Intelligent Child<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/emotional/front_emotional.htm#rr\">http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/emotional/front_emotional.htm#rr</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEinstein Never Used Flashcards: How Our Children Really Learn--and Why They<br/>\nNeed to Play More and Memorize Less<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Unprocessed Child: Living Without School<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/articles_subject.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/articles_subject.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps some!
