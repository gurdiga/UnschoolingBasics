I didn&#39;t mean to imply that their <br/>\nstuff is &quot;mess&quot; and mine is &quot;decor&quot;.  I just conveyed our solution to <br/>\nour family cleaning up process.  We all clean up our own mess in the <br/>\ncommon areas of the house (family room, kitchen, dining room) but <br/>\nother areas like our bedrooms and the sunroom are ours to do with as <br/>\nwe please.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I was trying to say, was I don&#39;t mind when their areas <br/>\nbecome messy, i.e. not orderly.  When our sunroom has more toys on the <br/>\nfloor than floor space I do think that is messy.  Just when I have <br/>\nmore sewing fabric on the table than table space that is messy.  Or <br/>\nwhen hubby leaves his hunting supplies and magazines all over the <br/>\nbedroom floor while he&#39;s organizing for this year&#39;s season it is messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t mean to imply that I don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s things by <br/>\ncalling them &#39;mess&#39;.
