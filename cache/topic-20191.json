Believe it or not (and I won&#39;t bore everyone with the long story) I actually got accused of starving her.  Yes, I was turned into social services.  She is adopted first off.  Hubby and I took her to a top notch Pediatric Endocrynologist who went to bat for us.  He said &quot;There is nothing wrong with this child.&quot;  He said not only does the blood work prove she is healthy, but look at her beautiful skin and hair.......she would not have those if you were starving her.  We proved to the state that our child was healthy and just fine.  The thing that pissed me off so bad is my daughter is not even skinny, thin & petite yes, skinny no.  But they looked at this little tiny kid and assumed something must be wrong.  Our daughter is not even anywhere close to being on the chart.  Her birth mother is 4&#39;9&quot; and the Endo said that our daughter will also be about the same height as her birth<br/>\n mother.  My daughter is also hispanic with a birth mother from Mexico.  My kid is always gonna be a peanut, but she is fine.  She does not need growth hormones or anything like that.  So if you ask me growth charts are just a tool, but not always an accurate tool.  You have to consider ethnic background, genetics, etc.  I look at all the little chinese girls being adopted from China.

It seems that a pacifier has enough substance so<br/>\nthat the muscles of the mouth in order to accommodate it pull the bones out of<br/>\nalignment, creating dental and other problems.

My dd (adopted at the age of 18months) didn&#39;t have a pacifier  but has always sucked on her tongue.  Not her thumb but her tongue. When she first came here, she actually made major teeth marks on her tongue. I actually had never heard of anyone sucking their tongue ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now 11 and still does it.  I think when she was a baby her bottle/paci was taken away way too early & this was her substitute.  I think as long as they need it, let them have it.  It drives my dh insane when she does it & will say &quot;Please stop doing that&quot; . I try & tell him she doesn&#39;t do it on purpose just to drive him crazy ~ sometimes he takes things so personally &lt;g&gt;.   I know its something she does subconsciously, mostly when she is upset about something or is really concentrating on something she is doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarol<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238249531,"authorName":"KARA CASSIDY","from":"&quot;KARA CASSIDY&quot; &lt;dachac3@...&gt;","profile":"dachac3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Pacifiers... how old is too old?","postDate":"1167780073","msgId":20195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEyMS1EQVYxNjAxNTVGODVDRUJGNjcxQ0JBMjRDRkFCQTBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PGVuZWp2NyszNHFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20193,"nextInTopic":20196,"prevInTime":20194,"nextInTime":20196,"topicId":20191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 3 year old does the same thing he also grinds his teeth if he does not have it so I to would be interested in  what others say my mother tells me to just","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-658742542\">My 3 year old does the same thing he also grinds his teeth if he does not have it so I to would be interested in  what others say my mother tells me to just throw it away but I am worried about the effect it will have on him.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: April&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aprilsmapril@...\">aprilsmapril@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, January 02, 2007 4:48 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Pacifiers... how old is too old?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I really don&#39;t ever post on this board, but I lurk ALOT :).
