<br/>\nwe live a bit up in the woods, so we decided for no other reason <br/>\nthan &quot;fun&quot; for the girls we would enroll them in the homeschool <br/>\ncharter program. it is an enrichment program, big group projects, a <br/>\nspring play every year, lots of fun field trips, camping together, <br/>\nect...ect... through enrolling in this program however i was suddenly <br/>\nthrown into accounting for our schooling. blak! we would have to sit <br/>\nand make semester &quot;plans&quot; witht he charter teacher, do follow up at <br/>\nthe end to see if those plans were fulfilled...eventually the teacher <br/>\nstarted going over standards with me and &quot;how are they going to be <br/>\nmet?&quot; sort of conversations. i would share my plans of learning <br/>\nthrough living, following their interests, my confidence in their <br/>\ncapabitilies.  slowly but surely i was pursuaded to just pick up some <br/>\nearly readers....how about the bob books....maybe use the math book <br/>\nsupplied by the school as a guideline....blah blah blah!! i fell into <br/>\nthe trap!BLAK!! last semester we followed the girls interests, i was <br/>\nable to document everything so all were happy for the most part. then <br/>\nholiday break came and i started feeling the pressure again to have <br/>\nthe girls up to &quot;standard&quot;....so....i bought math curriculm, explode <br/>\nthe code, borrowed story of the world (who am i??) and made a plan to <br/>\ndo some of these things everyday! wrote up a schedule the whole 9 <br/>\nyards! holiday was over....time to start school!! the first week went <br/>\nokay, some power struggles, i felt inadequate, we didn&#39;t really have <br/>\nmuch fun (but i sure was ablet o write down alot!), week 2.5 we went <br/>\non a road trip (all books packed, but i didn&#39;t really get them out we <br/>\nwere having too much fun exploring the science museum, children&#39;s <br/>\nmuseum, going on walks in the city and hikes in old favorite forests <br/>\nwe used to visit on a regular basis), week 3 back to the books....we <br/>\nall hated it! i was a beast, they loathed each other and our home was <br/>\nan unhappy one! it wasn&#39;t until week 4 when i got a phone call from <br/>\nthe charter teacher (even though remember this whole charter is <br/>\nsupposed to just be enrichment)recommending my oldest dd be held back <br/>\na grade since she isn&#39;t reading and wouldn&#39;t do well on the <br/>\ntesting....there was a little more in this phone call, but that was <br/>\nthe straw that broke this camels back (in a good way) we have since <br/>\n(a few weeks now) been back to unschooling....books all put away, <br/>\nother than our literature books which are asked for on a daily <br/>\nbasis....my dh (and i) see&#39;s such a dramatic change in the girls, in <br/>\nme and our home as a whole!!! he is &#39;almost&#39; convinced! he just wants <br/>\nto read a couple more articles and see it take place a little longer <br/>\n(he went to school as a teacher and has always been fairly <br/>\nalternative....so i know that this will be something that he will <br/>\neventually receives with open arms as a whole). it is a little scary <br/>\nturning and walking a totally different direction from all those who <br/>\nsurround you, but i know it is the best thing for our family. we are <br/>\ngoing to stick wiht the charter for now as our dd&#39;s have friends <br/>\nthere and love the spring musical they are a part of. i will write <br/>\ndown the things we do and be proud of not opening up a book we aren&#39;t <br/>\ninterested in. i will have to seek wisdom from others here who have <br/>\nbeen unschooling faced with pressures from family and close friends <br/>\n(most of my friends are all teachers....and not very alternative <br/>\nones), as well as the charter teacher (who is really a wonderful <br/>\nlady). with this list i am thankful i will be able to share struggles <br/>\nand not feel like all are pointing fingers saying &quot;see i told you it <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work&quot;. SO i thank you in advance! basically that is my intro <br/>\nand sort of history of where we are coming from. glad to be here! <br/>\nsarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9756,"nextTopicId":9985}}
