Post partum is a good example of this.  Some women produce a<br/>\nlot of prolactin after childbirth.  This is a good thing in that it helps<br/>\nbring on a good supply of milk.  For most women this hormone helps calm them<br/>\nand keep them relaxed.  Some women produce very little prolactin.  They<br/>\nstruggle with breastfeeding and are very moody or depressed.  Some women<br/>\nproduce prolactin in swings and will bounce from a state of euphoria to a<br/>\nstate of depression in a matter of a few hours. Some women can handle the<br/>\nchanges in hormonal level after birth and while they may feel depressed, it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t inhibit their ability to cope.

I don&#39;t think attributing it all to &quot;puberty&quot; is a good idea.<br/>\nEveryone is affected differently, but I also believe that part of the<br/>\n&quot;mood swings&quot; are due to how our society treats these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, at the onset of the menstrual cycle, our society does not<br/>\ncelebrate this cycle of life...it&#39;s seen as a nuisance.  Honoring the<br/>\nchanges in our bodies, the developmental stages we all go through is<br/>\nso much healthier in my opinion.<br/>\nI try to imagine a bunch of women gathered around me when I got my<br/>\nperiod as a teen.

Part of this journey is standing up for our children when they<br/>\nneed us.

Kids tend to behave around the  <br/>\nauthoritarian parent. But once they&#39;re out of the sight of the  <br/>\nauthoritarian parent it&#39;s a different story. And the sad part is that  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t misbehaving because they&#39;re bad and need more control.  <br/>\nThey&#39;re misbehaving because they&#39;re fighting to get loose of the  <br/>\nchains around them and it often turns out badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the world is divided between what you can and can&#39;t do, it&#39;s  <br/>\nnatural to want to challenge yourself on what others think you can&#39;t  <br/>\ndo.

When the  <br/>\nworld is divided between what you enjoy and what you don&#39;t enjoy  <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t a reason to do what you don&#39;t enjoy ;-) (Though sometimes  <br/>\nwe *choose* to do something we don&#39;t enjoy because we enjoy something  <br/>\nelse even less, like paying taxes instead of facing the hassle of a  <br/>\ntax audit, getting up at 5AM for a job because not having a job is  <br/>\nworse.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthoritarian parents often grew up in authoritarian homes where it  <br/>\nwas implied that adults get their way because they&#39;re adults. And  <br/>\nkids can have their way once they&#39;re adults too. So kids who&#39;ve grown  <br/>\nup expecting to have their way as adults pass that legacy onto their  <br/>\nown kids as the adults try to get their own way because, they feel,  <br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s my turn now!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line of authoritarian parenting is that kids want to be  <br/>\nfar far away from the parent. When they&#39;re teens they *are* going to  <br/>\ntry risky things because they haven&#39;t been allowed to try less risky  <br/>\nthings as kids to learn about themselves. And when things go wrong  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t going to come first to their parents. Some kids run away.  <br/>\nSome adult kids want to move away from their parents and have as  <br/>\nlittle as possible to do with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs what he&#39;s getting in the moment worth the price he&#39;ll pay in the  <br/>\nfuture?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Trying to express love<br/>\n&gt; and kindness respectfully then just as I was about to pull away my  <br/>\n&gt; daughters<br/>\n&gt; mouth kicks in for the last word and I slammed on the brake to give  <br/>\n&gt; her the<br/>\n&gt; look of the devil.

It&#39;s like breaking a habit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a clear vision of how you want to react, faking it until  <br/>\nyou make it is good. :-) But in the mean time it helps to be working  <br/>\non not suppressing the feelings of being out of control but of not  <br/>\nfeeling them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, it helps to create a vision of who you want to be so you know  <br/>\nwhat goal you&#39;re headed for.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, before you respond, always give yourself two choices. And  <br/>\nchoose the better one, the one that moves you towards the vision. (It  <br/>\nwill take time to remember to give yourself two choices, but make  <br/>\nthat a goal. Maybe make that the only goal for the next month.) Even  <br/>\nif you haven&#39;t made the best choice someone else would have, know  <br/>\nthat you&#39;ve made a *better* choice than in the past. And keep working  <br/>\nat it, working towards even better choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, try various techniques to connect to them throughout the day,  <br/>\nto remind yourself why it&#39;s great that they&#39;re in your life so that  <br/>\ncan carry over into the times when you think maybe this all isn&#39;t  <br/>\nworth it. When we&#39;re caught up in the moment of trying to get our  <br/>\nway, our children can seem like obstacles on the path. Consciously  <br/>\nwork at other times to see how great they are.

They need to know that you are confident and secure enough<br/>\nin yourself to handle their very intense emotions. They do NOT need to<br/>\nfeel responsible for our feelings, that is NOT their job.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we react harshly when they say things that seem rude or hurtful,<br/>\nthen they learn we are not safe to share feelings with. If you can use<br/>\nsome reflective conversation &quot;you feel really angry at me right now&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;so what you&#39;re saying is___________?&quot;  You will find them very<br/>\ncapable of calming down and getting to the heart of the matter with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen has been known to say &quot;I hate you&quot; when he&#39;s frustrated. Why<br/>\ntake it personal? It&#39;s a vent. They NEED to vent and feel safe with<br/>\nus. It&#39;s ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishments are stupid. Punishments and threats only get in the way of<br/>\nhealthy relationships. All you have to do is picture your partner<br/>\ntreating you that way to see how awful it would be for the<br/>\nrelationship. I know it&#39;s very hard to shift paradigms on the<br/>\npunishment/reward issue. But a lot of us have done it, with beautiful<br/>\nresults.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking candy away from a child doesn&#39;t truly teach them anything but<br/>\nresentment and/or self-loathing. We are the mirrors that reflect our<br/>\nchildren.  What we reflect to them is of absolute importance.<br/>\nDo we reflect annoyance?<br/>\nDo we reflect fear and mistrust?<br/>\nDo we reflect their beauty and wholeness, their goodness?<br/>\n<br/>\nBalance is a really BIG part of this unschooling adventure. Ask<br/>\nyourself if that child was not here tomorrow, would this thing you&#39;re<br/>\nupset about really matter at all? Usually it isn&#39;t truly important.<br/>\n&quot;Attitude&quot; is a GOOD thing for a child to have. They are trying to<br/>\ncommunicate with you.<br/>\nIf it comes across rude/mean-spirited, where did that come from?<br/>\nI would simply say &quot;I understand you are frustrated right now, but<br/>\ncould you say it like this (and then paraphrase for them) so I can<br/>\nlisten better&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are the adults. We are responsible for our own feelings. We are<br/>\nresponsible for how our children see themselves to a very large<br/>\ndegree...we need to make sure the reflection is clear and not<br/>\ndistorted through our own fears, lack or annoyance. We need to be full<br/>\nand balanced enough to give them this....or at least process these<br/>\nissues quietly on our own without dumping it on our children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all a huge shift.<br/>\nBut from many of us that have BTDT, it&#39;s really an important shift to<br/>\nmake for the healing to take place and relationships to blossom in a<br/>\nway that invites unschooling into our lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, &quot;attitude&quot; is not a puberty thing in my experience. I have a 16<br/>\nyear old that is really sweet and loving, not at all like the<br/>\n&quot;typical&quot; teen. I think if a child is angry or speaking hurftully,<br/>\nthey need to be heard. There&#39;s some hurt or disrpespect they&#39;ve had in<br/>\ntheir lives that needs to be processed.
