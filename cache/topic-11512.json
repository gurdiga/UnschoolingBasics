One thing i had to remember(and we are very, very new to unschooling) is that we <br/>\nare not sure what our kids will learn, and we need to create an umbrella to &quot;protect&quot; us.  If <br/>\nshe reads 100 books a month(and she does) did i want to put the specifics or just say &quot;a <br/>\nvariety of fiction and non-fiction books will be included&quot;.  But i couldn&#39;t say she WILL read <br/>\n100 books a month, because she may not.  That is what i meant by having your Minimum <br/>\nCourse of Study papers flexible, with unschooling you never know what they will learn.  If <br/>\nyou are interested i can email a copy of what i did.
