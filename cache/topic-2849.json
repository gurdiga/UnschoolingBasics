I don&#39;t feed my animals on a schedule.  We  use autofeeders <br/>\nand the food is available all the time.  None of my pets  are overweight, but I <br/>\nwould guess if I had one that woofed its food down that  I&#39;d think twice about <br/>\nautofeeders.  But I&#39;d probably leave it out and see  if the dog would ever <br/>\nget full.  I&#39;d bet it would relax after a while and  not be so crazed about <br/>\ngetting it all.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy son and his wife have rescued 3 cats, and everyone of them are really,  <br/>\nreally overweight now.  They dole out the food once or twice a day, and  it&#39;s <br/>\neven weightloss food.  The cats don&#39;t eat it all at once.  But  they live in a <br/>\nsmall 1 bedroom apartment, so the cats don&#39;t have as much room to  roam as mine <br/>\ndo.  My son and I are trying to figure out why his cats are so  fat (all <br/>\nabout the same age) and mine are not.  I think it has to do with  the very idea <br/>\nthat the food supply is controlled for his cats and not for  mine.  I think his <br/>\ncats eat more because they know sometimes the  bowl gets empty, and they never <br/>\nknow when it might be their turn to visit  the bowl after the last cat just <br/>\nate the last morsel.  So they  gobble.  <br/>\n <br/>\nOur house is open to the pets.  We have a pet door into the kitchen,  and <br/>\nthey have the whole acre lot fenced in for their to use.  (The cats  don&#39;t stay <br/>\nin the fence, though.)  My dog would leave the yard and visit  around the <br/>\nneighborhood if there weren&#39;t a fence, but she&#39;d come back because  she knows where <br/>\nher bed is.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re about as AP &lt;g&gt; as you can be with animals, but they ARE  animals, and <br/>\nnot children.  <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: a funny &quot;learning&quot; experience for me","postDate":"1092926843","msgId":2858,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnMmVocittamJvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNnMHIwaytnc2liQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2850,"nextInTopic":2859,"prevInTime":2857,"nextInTime":2859,"topicId":2849,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... giving ...
