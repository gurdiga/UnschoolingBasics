Nobody cares about spelling, so that is nice - takes the pressure  <br/>\noff and leaves the nonspellers comfortable to write a lot more than  <br/>\nthey would otherwise. Lots of things happen - sometimes a kid can&#39;t  <br/>\nfollow what my daughter is saying and says, &quot;Huh? Don&#39;t understand.&quot;  <br/>\nThen my daughter tries to spell better so her friend will understand.  <br/>\nLots of times she&#39;ll type something - &quot;Cm 2 my hous,&quot; for example. She  <br/>\nknows she&#39;s abbreviating come with cm, but meant to spell house  <br/>\ncorrectly. So, when her friend writes back, &quot;Cant - gtg 2 gma&#39;s  <br/>\nhouse,&quot; then my daughter sees &quot;house&quot; spelled correctly.
