You have to  register <br/>\nwith the state, keep attendance and immunization records on hand, and  <br/>\nstandardize test once a year, also just kept on hand.  They can decide to  check on <br/>\nyour conditions, but they supposedly give you some notice.  I knew  some <br/>\npeople that had h/s&#39;ed there for twenty years and had never even known  anyone that <br/>\ngot a visit.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, if your children are young, you don&#39;t register until they turn  seven.  I <br/>\nwas lucky that our timing was such that I was only registered for  less than <br/>\na year and we were moved just before my son turn eight.....we never  did a <br/>\nstandardized test!  <br/>\n <br/>\nA few radical unschoolers I know feel like NC is an excellent state in  which <br/>\nto unschool.

You just file with the Department on Non-Public Education. You can send in a letter or use their form. They send back an orange card verifying they have your papers. They ask that you keep an attendance form, immunization record or expemption form, and yearly test scores. The testing though is very lenient, only needs to cover language arts and mathematics.

I unschooled my girls for 7 yrs in the chapel hill Durham area of NC - this was yrs  ago so double check with any changes in the law but at that time... home schooling was considered a &quot;private school&quot;.. we were supposed to keep &quot;records&quot; and have them tested every  3yrs (?)... I was and still am very rebellious... hence no records :)... as far as the testing goes I did do that but...NO ONE ever asked to see it... it sits to this day in a file  cabinet in our basement :) .... I will tell you that in my experience NC  people as a whole were wonderfully it was easy to find like minded individuals and loads of people doing alternative parenting/education styles...loads of fun things to do ... loads of activities set up for home schoolers (we are now in rural IN and very much the weird family :) .....any how good luck  that area of the country is beautiful and has a special energy all its own... we long to move back..<br/>\n  Brightest Blessings<br/>\n  Andre<br/>\n<br/>\nsandralzires &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sandralzires@...\">sandralzires@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  Hey all, <br/>\nI currently live and unschool in TN where I find the laws to be <br/>\nmoderate.
