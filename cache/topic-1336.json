It&#39;s<br/>\ndifficult to know how to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeeling &quot;broken&quot; is especially telling. You can&#39;t be a proper mother to your<br/>\ndear little girl if you are broken. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe can&#39;t be responsible for your happiness either - it is too much for a<br/>\nchild to have to be your only source of joy. Believe me, I spent my<br/>\nchildhood feeling responsible for my mother&#39;s emotions, and it is amazing<br/>\nhow this dynamic can last for ever and color your relationship negatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I wanted <br/>\nto share the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\n Her and her son where getting away from her EX in CA. She had no <br/>\nplace to live, and no job. BUT the company she worked for said they <br/>\nwould hire her out here. She had been my best friend for years, but <br/>\nclearly not close as we lived 3000 miles away. I had no idea she was <br/>\nlike this, none at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n So she moves away from everything she knew to start over and it <br/>\nseems like she is not learning anything at all. It took her months to <br/>\nstart the job and then she got fired. We are NOW in a very bad way <br/>\nwhen it comes to money, all the savings is gone and all the bills are <br/>\ndue. <br/>\n<br/>\n Mean while she is still in the hospital for her breathing problems. <br/>\nShe is supposed to start her new job next week. He and I agree on few <br/>\nthings as it turns out. But I just can not kick her out. She smokes <br/>\nout side as asked by us, she does not hit her son in front of my <br/>\nfamily as we asked her, and she is working on not yelling at them. <br/>\nBut there is just something wrong with her..... <br/>\n<br/>\n She wanted my husband to drop her son off to her at the hospital <br/>\ntonight before his double shift. I asked who would pick him up and <br/>\nshe said he would stay over night with her and go home with her when <br/>\nshe is discarged. He is 4 years old! She has no money to buy food for <br/>\nhim and nothing for him to do. Her responce was that the nurses would <br/>\nhelp her. They are not even letting her walk the halls yet. I told <br/>\nher I would ask him and let her go, got sick of her complaing about <br/>\nproblems she has gotten her self into. So I call the hospital and ask <br/>\nthem about what she is planning and they say it will not happen and <br/>\nif she tried they would be forced to call social services on her as <br/>\nthere is no one to get her son when my hubby is working and her <br/>\nneighbor friend is away. So they said they would talk to her about <br/>\nit. She calls me latter in short telling me off and saying she will <br/>\ndo what every she wants with her son and that she can not sleep <br/>\nwithout him and on and on and on. All this time she told us he could <br/>\nnot sleep without her, thus they share a bed. The last few nights <br/>\nhave proven he has no problem sleeping with out Mommy. Soooo it shows <br/>\nshe is dependent on him emotionally not the other way around. <br/>\ngreat... more problems. So in short she is not talking to me. <br/>\n<br/>\n I am leaving it all up to hubby now. I have tried. I just have no <br/>\nclue what else to do. If she stays and changes and works they we have <br/>\na chance to get out of the whole, if she leaves/kicked out, then we <br/>\nwill be in a bad way for a very long time and not even sure we could <br/>\nmake it.
