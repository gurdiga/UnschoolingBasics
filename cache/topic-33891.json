(Left brain activities) They are not<br/>\n&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning- everything that comes in is pure truth to <br/>\nthem.<br/>\nWhen a child is reading, or using the computer, or playing outside, both<br/>\nsides of the brain are being used at once.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe connectors between the two halves of the brain are being formed at <br/>\nthese<br/>\nearly ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, <br/>\nthat<br/>\nis much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child <br/>\nwho<br/>\nis using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>\nplaying, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc <br/>\netc..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, as parents we are to keep our children safe and healthy. I&#39;m not <br/>\nin the<br/>\nhabit of feeding my children junk- and they like the healthy organic <br/>\nfood I<br/>\ngive them.  If early TV has been shown to be linked with neurological <br/>\ndelays<br/>\nand irrevocable damage, then I think we should possibly consider not <br/>\nhaving<br/>\nTV around to watch for the wee ones... because if that is keeping our<br/>\nchildren from future harm, then is it much different from feeding our<br/>\nchildren healthy meals and keeping our children from harm by not letting<br/>\nthem cross the street themselves without holding hands?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand, I am not talking about suddenly disallowing TV for <br/>\nolder<br/>\nchildren- because I think that can have disastrous effects for the<br/>\nparent/child relationship.  I am definitely NOT a punitively minded <br/>\nparent-<br/>\nI believe gentle discipline and mindful parenting are key to a happy<br/>\nrelationship with children.

(Left brain activities) They are not<br/>\n&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning- everything that comes in is pure truth to them.<br/>\nWhen a child is reading, or using the computer, or playing outside, both<br/>\nsides of the brain are being used at once. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe connectors between the two halves of the brain are being formed at these<br/>\nearly ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, that<br/>\nis much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child who<br/>\nis using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>\nplaying, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n So, as parents we are to keep our children safe and healthy. I&#39;m not in the<br/>\nhabit of feeding my children junk- and they like the healthy organic food I<br/>\ngive them.  If early TV has been shown to be linked with neurological delays<br/>\nand irrevocable damage, then I think we should possibly consider not having<br/>\nTV around to watch for the wee ones... because if that is keeping our<br/>\nchildren from future harm, then is it much different from feeding our<br/>\nchildren healthy meals and keeping our children from harm by not letting<br/>\nthem cross the street themselves without holding hands?  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand, I am not talking about suddenly disallowing TV for older<br/>\nchildren- because I think that can have disastrous effects for the<br/>\nparent/child relationship.  I am definitely NOT a punitively minded parent-<br/>\nI believe gentle discipline and mindful parenting are key to a happy<br/>\nrelationship with children.  And as other posts have mentioned,<br/>\nrelationships can be formed watching TV together, snuggling, and discussing<br/>\nwhat was watched. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy struggle is how to create meaningful non-tv experiences with my children<br/>\nonce they have already been living a life full of tv. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nTherese<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327608745,"authorName":"ann329851","from":"&quot;ann329851&quot; &lt;annworsley991@...&gt;","profile":"ann329851","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: TV- help me understand","postDate":"1214244879","msgId":33940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczb3A2ZitodGgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGczb21iNitrdmdxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33938,"nextInTopic":33941,"prevInTime":33939,"nextInTime":33941,"topicId":33891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... this. ... over ... watch ... if ... aarrgghhh, now im wondering why my tv lisence is higher than £139. i pay or did pay £15 per month for 12 months which","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-559289465\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Deb&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Therese Franklin&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;theresefranklin@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I see what you are saying, but the research just doesn&#39;t back <br/>\n </span></blockquote>this.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; believe this.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You don&#39;t believe that listening/watching TV is not passive?

They need love<br/>\nand grace, just as we all do. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is well stated;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;CAN tv be truly harmful?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Can anything a child is interested in harm them when explored with a<br/>\nloving and connected adult?<br/>\nWe&#39;re not advocating neglect...but we are advocating freedom of<br/>\nchoice. Yes, even for children. They have so few choices if the adults<br/>\nin their lives choose to limit and control them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree, there are many books full of junk- like James Dobson. blech!!<br/>\nI usually do my reading with discernment, and while reading &#39;The Plug in<br/>\nDrug&#39; I had alot of &#39;wrong&#39; alarms going off, but yes, it fed into my fears,<br/>\nas I have discussed in other posts. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;There are books that will tell you school is absolutely necessary and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>your child won&#39;t succeed without it. There are books that very<br/>\nconvincingly discuss how necessary it is to start teaching children<br/>\nhow to read and write and do math at VERY young ages.

You are freaking yourself<br/>\nout and that can&#39;t keep you calm and happy and engaging with your children.<br/>\nThe studies that you are reading are out of date. The AAP also recommends<br/>\nnot co-sleeping, and I&#39;m sure a bunch of other things that you might not<br/>\nagree with. Quit worrying about it and sit down and watch television with<br/>\nyour daughters. Quit spending time feeling like what they are enjoying is<br/>\ndamaging them and enjoy it with them. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well said.  I may just do that.  AAP doesn&#39;t know jack about co-sleeping.<br/>\nAnd as far as not worrying about what is damaging them- that is always on my<br/>\nmind.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nWho are you to decide what is meaningful for someone else? For Linnaea<br/>\nwatching Raven for the 5th time can be more meaningful than playing with the<br/>\nknot tying cards that I just pulled out, sometimes. For Simon, when he was<br/>\n2, watching Tellytubbies all snuggled in my arms while we both shouted<br/>\n&quot;again, again&quot; was far more meaningful than listening to the Very Hungry<br/>\nCaterpillar or playing in the mud outside. Not that those things didn&#39;t<br/>\nhappen also, but those moments with the Tellytubbies were very special to<br/>\nhim. And if I had decided that my opinion, my view of his world was more<br/>\nimportant than his own, surely I would be producing a child as the article<br/>\nyou mentioned fearfully warns has a &quot;greater dependence on adult supervision<br/>\nby creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves.&quot; <br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I can see that Tellytubbies isn&#39;t special in itself, but the time<br/>\ntogether was.  <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to say no to the television to increase the amount of reading<br/>\ntime, outside play time and creative making time. Often the television<br/>\naccompanies some of that in our house. Creative time and the television<br/>\ncombine quite nicely. Drawing, painting, making sculptures with playdoh,<br/>\nusing candles to create wax shapes, typing on an old typewriter, building<br/>\nwith hama beads, building with legos, building with blocks, dancing, playing<br/>\ngames, playing dress-up, face painting, caring for animals, and more, we&#39;ve<br/>\ndone with the television on. Offering to read or to go outside and play<br/>\nhopscotch or jump rope or go to a cool nature reserve or go to the zoo or<br/>\nwhatever it is that you want to do outside, those things don&#39;t have to mean<br/>\nexcluding the television.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy limiting their choices to what you want them to do they won&#39;t ever get to<br/>\nchoose freely what they want to do. And there will come a point where they<br/>\nare no longer living only under your roof. They will be making their choices<br/>\nbased on the desire to have a limited good rather than on the desire to do<br/>\nor not to do.

We are a land of talkers, we pay<br/>\ntalkers the most and admire talkers the most, and so our children talk<br/>\nconstantly, following the public models of television and schoolteachers. It<br/>\nis very difficult to teach the &quot;basics&quot; anymore because they really aren&#39;t<br/>\nbasic to the society we&#39;ve made.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Two institutions at present control our children&#39;s lives - television and<br/>\nschooling, in that order. Both of these reduce the real world of wisdom,<br/>\nfortitude, temperance, and justice to a never-ending, non-stopping<br/>\nabstraction. In centuries past the time of a child and adolescent would be<br/>\noccupied in real work, real charity, real adventures, and the realistic<br/>\nsearch for mentors who might teach what you really wanted to learn. A great<br/>\ndeal of time was spent in community pursuits, practicing affection, meeting<br/>\nand studying every level of the community, learning how to make a home, and<br/>\ndozens of other tasks necessary to become a whole man or woman.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut overall I think this is coming from a man who was overly fed-up with<br/>\n&#39;teaching&#39; school children in the failing system that it is.  I realize that<br/>\nhe isn&#39;t talking about homeschoolers here.  Just how TV plays a role in<br/>\nschooled children&#39;s lives.  I am coming to realize that I may be putting a<br/>\nlot of my own fears into this because when I wasn&#39;t in school, my escape was<br/>\nTV- same with my Dh.  So when we think of being &#39;out of school&#39; and &#39;doing<br/>\nwhatever we want&#39;. we think of what we did- massive TV time after school.<br/>\nYet my children will have the benefit of living without institutionalized<br/>\nschooling.. Hmm I have to think about this more. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So, say YES to the tv. But don&#39;t forget to fill up the calendar with<br/>\n </span></blockquote>other things that are interesting. Take the kids to the beach, or on a hike,<br/>\nor to a museum. Get out of the house at least several times a week, and<br/>\nexplore the world.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nExcellent.  This sounds very balanced to me.

Awesome response!  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you read a &quot;convincing&quot; book about how apples cause children to &quot;be&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>ADHD, would you ban apples from your home? Because of a book?  Can you look<br/>\nat *YOUR CHILDREN* and see what makes them happy?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point.  I am usually pretty discerning of what I read.  And to answer<br/>\nyour question, lately I don&#39;t know what makes my 4 year old happy.  I am<br/>\ntrying to connect with her right now.  So many times I have asked her, WHY<br/>\nare you SO unhappy ALL the time.  Why do you cry and whine most of the<br/>\nday???  What can I do to make you happy?  This is a work in progress right<br/>\nnow.  I still breastfeed and sling my 2 year old, so I always worry I&#39;m not<br/>\nspending enough time with my independent, sensitive little 4 year old girl.<br/>\nSo far we have been having better days with all the yeses, though DH thinks<br/>\nI&#39;m creating a monster.. That&#39;s another post.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How much TV do *you* watch? Why? Because it was &quot;regulated&quot; and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>controlled when you were a child? Why do we, as adults. choose NOT to watch<br/>\nTV 24/7? Because we have the power to do just that! We really could keep the<br/>\nTV on all day, every day. If we choose *not* to, why?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so I see you are leading me somewhere with this, and I will go ahead<br/>\nand take the plunge.. The problem I have with this is that - I don&#39;t think<br/>\nchildren are just merely small adults.  (Although I believe we have the same<br/>\nfeelings that children do, which makes us better able to understand and meet<br/>\ntheir needs.).  Yet adults can sometimes predict what can happen - forsee<br/>\nthings that children cannot see.  I can predict that if the TV is on ALL DAY<br/>\nthat my 4 year old will be crying and whining for the most of the afternoon<br/>\nand evening, over stimulated, tired and upset.  Now- the reason could<br/>\npossibly be because I don&#39;t watch the videos WITH her, as you mentioned and<br/>\nshe is craving my cuddles and attention.  But I am just not interested in<br/>\nwatching Jungle book for the 14th time with her.   This is why I would much<br/>\nrather be playing with her than watching TV.  Getting rid of videos is more<br/>\na kick in the pants for ME- for me to spend more time with her rather than<br/>\nME being on the computer all day.  That said, I DID have unlimited TV time<br/>\nas a teen- the TV was always on when I was home.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; PLEASE don&#39;t divide things into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;non-educational&quot; on<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this list!

Yes, she has amazed me with how she can use a computer, use the mouse<br/>\nto find the right folder, and begin to &#39;read&#39; which movie file is the<br/>\ncorrect one she wants.  Yes there has been a lot of learning by turning on<br/>\nthe media center.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; TV is not the enemy. Doing nothing is.

I&#39;m pretty sure that children NEED<br/>\ntime to do nothing.  Genius can be created out of boredom. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Could she maybe simply have been *ready* to speak?<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of like drilling a child in reading. Chances are that the <br/>\nchild would read no matter what, but because the teacher spent weeks <br/>\nand months drilling the child, the *drilling* &quot;worked.&quot; And it really <br/>\nhad nothing to do with the child&#39;s suddenly being *ready* to read. The <br/>\n&quot;teacher&quot; and her drills get the credit.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVery good point.  She probably WAS ready to speak. as soon as I turned off<br/>\nthe TV and was able to listen to her. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Why don&#39;t we choose to ban all those things before age two? What makes <br/>\n </span></blockquote>TV different? Because it&#39;s pictures moving fast on a screen? I&#39;m having a<br/>\nproblem understanding how listening can be passive. And we don&#39;t &quot;practice&quot;<br/>\nlanguage---we USE it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBy &#39;practicing&#39; I mean using it- not watching TV..  The brain has been<br/>\nstudied while watching tv and while doing other things.  The theory is that<br/>\nwhen a child is &#39;listening&#39; to the TV, they are only using receptors from<br/>\none (right was it?) side of the brain, whereas the thinking, discerning,<br/>\ncalculating, applying parts of the brain are not being used.  They are not<br/>\n&#39;thinking&#39; or discerning (talking early childhood here)- everything that<br/>\ncomes in is pure truth to them. when a child is reading, or using the<br/>\ncomputer, or playing outside, both sides of the brain are being used at<br/>\nonce.  And the connectors between the two halves are being formed at these<br/>\nearly ages- so when a child is spending 55 hours a week of watching TV, that<br/>\nis much less time for those connectors to do their thing, than a child who<br/>\nis using both sides of their brain most of the day, most of the time, by<br/>\nplaying, reading, riding their tricycle, talking to mom and dad, etc etc..  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Really? Some mornings I would come downstairs and find Cameron<br/>\n </span></blockquote>completely covered in &quot;tiger stripes&quot; that he&#39;d drawn on himself to be Sher<br/>\nKahn. Then I would tie a &quot;tail&quot; to his waist and he would growl and &quot;swipe&quot;<br/>\nus with his paw. I&#39;d &quot;tie&quot; &quot;fire&quot; to his &quot;tail,&quot; and he would run off into<br/>\nthe wild only to return with stories of what he did to survive and come back<br/>\nfor Mowgli afterwards.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay that totally sounds like my 4 year old!!  I don&#39;t discount that this<br/>\ntype of pretend play is useful- it IS meaningful and useful to them and that<br/>\nis a good point.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah---great.

Will you freak out when they want those?<br/>\nOr will you accept that that is OK?  You don&#39;t have to decide now. But it&#39;s<br/>\ncertainly something to think about &#39;cause that day *will* come.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a part of more than a few playgroups and that day has already came<br/>\nand went.  I don&#39;t freak when they want those things- I freely let them have<br/>\nthe treats they want, as much cake as they want and I let them get their<br/>\nstomachaches- they don&#39;t usually want it after that.  (Both my girls have<br/>\nallergies to milk proteins)  You must have misunderstood me before. I do<br/>\nallow for the freedom of French fries when we are out and that&#39;s all that<br/>\navailable or when we are at parties.  If they want French fries, they can<br/>\nhave it.But my kids like and crave natural foods  ;)  I buy organic healthy<br/>\nand mostly vegan food to eat at home, and they like it.  I just try to model<br/>\nhealthy eating.  The cool  thing is that most of my mommy friends buy the<br/>\norganic natural fruit loops and bring those in baggies to share.  We make<br/>\nOatmeal cookies, chocolate cake, and apple pie, chocolate shakes, and its<br/>\nall healthy and raw.  I don&#39;t think they feel they are missing out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yep. Because people crave what they can&#39;t have.

It works great when they&#39;re little, but <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t stay that way&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you.  I am learning to let go of lots of controlling behaviors-<br/>\nthings my mother did to me, etc etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for limiting the TV- I have not put any limits on videos right now, I&#39;m<br/>\ndon&#39;t think that creating a power struggle will do any good.  I am just<br/>\ntrying to follow the advice of BEING interesting and having interesting<br/>\nthings in their reach, and keeping busy by going to interesting places and<br/>\nsuch.  So far we have had an awesome day at the beach today, with lots of<br/>\nplaying in the sand and water and seaweed.  Days like this make me not<br/>\nworry.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do overly worry about stuff most of the time, and what other people<br/>\nsay about how we plan to homeschool- &#39;irresponsible parenting&#39;, etc etc.<br/>\nAnd after having taught elementary school, I am big time still de-schooling<br/>\nmyself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLove the responses!

I am still moving<br/>\nforward in my unschooling journey; we are not all the way there, yet,<br/>\nbut we are much further along than two years ago.  Keep reading and<br/>\nchallenging yourself.  Unschooling is not the easy path, it is hard. <br/>\nBut so far, every step of the way has been worth it many times over.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have noticed<br/>\n&gt; on many unschooling boards, the TV is not limited for children, and I<br/>\n&gt; would like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to<br/>\n&gt; unschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>\n&gt; family.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen<br/>\n&gt; the amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids have no limits on their tv.  Even if I tried, at this point it<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t work.  They both know how to turn on the system, they can<br/>\nenter the channel numbers they&#39;ve memorized and scroll through the<br/>\nguide for those they haven&#39;t. They can record shows, search the TiVo<br/>\nlist for shows they enjoy, delete stuff they didn&#39;t like, switch to<br/>\nthe DVD player . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls&#39; tv viewing habits, like those of me and my dh, wax and<br/>\nwane.  During bad weather, or when I am preoccupied with something,<br/>\nthey often turn the tv on more frequently.  They often watch tv during<br/>\nbreakfast, because it seems to take me a while to wake up in the<br/>\nmorning.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>\n&gt; prompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh<br/>\n&gt; and I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was<br/>\n&gt; fine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>\n&gt; children the option of watching however much TV they want is like<br/>\n&gt; throwing cocaine to a drug user and saying, you can have however much<br/>\n&gt; you want until you&#39;ve had your fill...  they do believe that children<br/>\n&gt; will eventually self- regulate their TV watching on their own as they<br/>\n&gt; grow older, but their point is- at what cost - losing so much time out<br/>\n&gt; of their childhood, etc etc.  I realize that that is a bit extreme...<br/>\n&gt; still processing this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, I started to read that book, and it just made me gag.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand how something can be like a drug but can be self-regulated.<br/>\n One of the hallmarks of addiction is that one can never have enough.<br/>\n If you remove restrictions on tv, then of course your children will<br/>\nwant to watch it non-stop for a while.  They are checking to see if<br/>\nyou really mean &quot;no restrictions.&quot;  The suggestion that a child will<br/>\nchoose to watch tv for years and years instead of choosing other<br/>\nactivities is a little silly, really.  I mean, would *you* choose to<br/>\ndo nothing but watch tv for years and years?  If so, there must not be<br/>\nanything else of interest in your life.  The same holds true with<br/>\nchildren.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is nothing else of interest in their lives, then of course tv<br/>\nwill become an all-day every day thing.  My kids routinely turn off<br/>\nthe tv and let me know they&#39;re going outside, or they pull games off<br/>\nthe shelf, or haul out the dress-up stuff, or whatever.  We have a<br/>\nbroad selection of toys, games, and activities that are easily<br/>\naccessible to the kids -- shelves or bins holding everything within<br/>\neasy reach.  They don&#39;t have to ask, they can just pull out what they<br/>\nwant.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Now with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>\n&gt; gotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>\n&gt; from morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>\n&gt; after video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>\n&gt; how to operate our media center and turns it on herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is cool, actually -- she is comfortable with the technology.  We<br/>\nwere thrilled for our kids when they figured out the remotes and<br/>\nwhatnot.  Movies are only &quot;not educational&quot; if you choose to see it<br/>\nthat way.  *Finding Nemo* has led my kids to ask questions about the<br/>\noceans, different kinds of fish and what they eat, where the movie<br/>\ntakes place, Australia and what other kinds of animals live there, the<br/>\nCrocodile Hunter (including how he died) and Bindi (who has her own<br/>\npretty cool show), the Wiggles, dancing, singing, acting, scuba<br/>\ndiving, giant sea turtles, whether or not sharks come close to the<br/>\nbeach, coral reefs, undersea mines, the minesweeper my dad served on<br/>\nwhen he was in the Navy, ocean currents, the water cycle, wastewater<br/>\ntreatment . . . I&#39;m serious.  One movie.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the<br/>\n&gt; studies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And <br/>\n&gt; basically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being<br/>\n&gt; watched- even if its &#39;educational&#39;, there is an impact on the developing<br/>\n&gt; brain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is<br/>\n&gt; impeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the<br/>\n&gt; future...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Fear-mongering is everywhere. As your children&#39;s parent, you are with<br/>\nthem day in and day out.  My dd Emma has &quot;shown signs of ADHD&quot; since<br/>\nshe was very young.  I&#39;m sure that if I sent her to school, she would<br/>\ncome back within a week carrying a note requesting that I get her on<br/>\nRitalin.  She can jump from one thing to another faster than I can<br/>\nrealize.  But she also has amazing concentration when she&#39;s working on<br/>\na project that&#39;s important to her.  She has a far-reaching<br/>\nimagination, and she comes up with most of the make-believe games that<br/>\nshe and her sister play.  No way in the world would I think that those<br/>\nabilities are a negative, and no way in the world would I let someone<br/>\nelse tell her they are.  And seeing this in Emma has actually helped<br/>\nme to realize that I am very similar, so instead of worrying about<br/>\nlabels, I&#39;ve started to concentrate on being aware of how much I have<br/>\ntaken on, and trying to decrease my to-do list so I can focus on the<br/>\nthings I really enjoy.  In finding a more successful way of dealing<br/>\nwith my own tendency to try everything and finish nothing, I hope to<br/>\nprovide a better model for Emma.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh didn&#39;t speak until somewhere between 2 and 3, and my MIL is<br/>\nalways quick to point out that once he did start speaking, he spoke in<br/>\ncomplete sentences, and had a lot to say.  Language development is<br/>\nvery individualized.  Personally, we&#39;ve found that since we constantly<br/>\ninvolve the girls in our conversations -- tv or no tv -- they have<br/>\namazing vocabularies.   Some kids are slower to talk, just like some<br/>\nare slower to crawl, or walk, or feed themselves, or use the toilet .<br/>\n. . . <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Quote from Jane Healy:<br/>\n&gt; depriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>\n&gt;  close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>\n&gt; interactive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>\n&gt; opportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation  enhance<br/>\n&gt; the brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>\n&gt; passivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>\n&gt; deprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>\n&gt; relationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>\n&gt; have deleterious and irrevocable consequences.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t take much effort to be on the sofa with your kids, watching<br/>\nthe video and making observations about what you see.  Pause the video<br/>\ncomment that the character seems very sad, or frustrated, or whatever,<br/>\nand have a short discussion about feelings.  TV and videos are a great<br/>\nspringboard for talking about our emotions and the way we handle them<br/>\nappropriately or not.  I&#39;ve found that it actually gives me more<br/>\nopportunities to help my kids see what does and doesn&#39;t work wrt<br/>\nproblem solving, expressing feelings and emotions, and more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>\n&gt; started speaking better after we got rid of the TV initially- which I<br/>\n&gt; believe led to simply more chances for her to practice her language<br/>\n&gt; instead of being a passive listener. So now that their has been a<br/>\n&gt; revival of videos being watched in our home... I worry again how it is<br/>\n&gt; affecting her brain and language again.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, talk about what you are seeing.  And in addition to the videos,<br/>\nget out and about.  *Do* things.  Go to the library for storytime,<br/>\nvisit a children&#39;s museum, have a picnic lunch at the park, go for a<br/>\nhike, visit the aquarium, etc.  If TV is the only thing in your<br/>\nchild&#39;s life, then of course it can have a negative impact.  If the<br/>\nonly thing you ever eat is carrot, that can be a problem, too.  But<br/>\nunschooling is not about sitting in front of the tv all day long. <br/>\nUnschooling is about exploring the world (which is huge and full of<br/>\nmany, many things to enjoy), and finding out where your interests lie.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Here is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>\n&gt; a break from their child&#39;s activity and attention.

I have found this to be true- that<br/>\n&gt; my children&#39;s imaginations are much more rich and organic when there<br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t the constant TV shows playing in their heads for them to act out. <br/>\n&gt; They play much better by themselves without TV.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First off, I think that if you think unschooling is a good idea, you<br/>\nwould better serve yourself to stop reading mainstream or traditional<br/>\nparenting magazines.  They will make the journey more difficult. (I am<br/>\nfar enough along that I get frustrated with the mainstream advice I<br/>\nsee on some of my old bbs.  I&#39;ve stopped visitng them, because I was<br/>\noften the only person who &quot;let&quot; my kids use the internet, or whatever,<br/>\nand I never seemed to get any useful information. . . it got too<br/>\npainful to sort through all the posts on spanking and time outs and<br/>\npower-struggles in search of one nugget that usually wasn&#39;t there,<br/>\nanyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I&#39;ve found that my kids don&#39;t play *better* without TV . . .<br/>\njust differently.  Sometimes they act out a tv show, sometimes they<br/>\ndon&#39;t, and sometimes they take a tv show and add their own imaginative<br/>\ncomponents, or blend two shows together to create their own show. <br/>\nThey hold rock concerts and pretend they are the Wiggles or Laurie<br/>\nBerkner.  They created their own superhero mythology.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t they get used to doing other more meaningful, developmentally<br/>\n&gt; approapriate things for their age- such as playing in the mud?  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But my kids play in the mud, too.  They love playing in the mud.  TV<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t change that.  They still have tea-parties.  But instead of<br/>\ndressing as princesses (like &quot;most&quot; little girls), they dress as<br/>\npirates, animals, or kung-fu masters instead.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Overall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>\n&gt; time, and creative making time.  BTW, I have been seeing a great<br/>\n&gt; decrease in the amount of whining in my 4 year old because i have been<br/>\n&gt; consistanly working on our relationship and trying to say &#39;YES&quot; every<br/>\n&gt; time she asks for things... so saying no to the TV is going to be a<br/>\n&gt; conflict.... any ideas for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you say YES in one area, why not another?  One thing that really<br/>\nhelped me to let go of areas I still wanted some control over was<br/>\nthis:  Instead of viewing it as a parent-child issue, how would it<br/>\nchange if it was an adult-adult issue?  How would you feel and react<br/>\nif your dh said you . . . couldn&#39;t have a piece of cake?  . . .<br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed to watch a movie you were interested in?  . . . had to<br/>\nhave scrambled tofu for breakfast, when you wanted scrambled eggs? <br/>\nHad to wear the blue dress instead of the black one?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, say YES to the tv.  But don&#39;t forget to fill up the calendar with<br/>\nother things that are interesting.  Take the kids to the beach, or on<br/>\na hike, or to a museum.  Get out of the house at least several times a<br/>\nweek, and explore the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWendy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327608745,"authorName":"ann329851","from":"&quot;ann329851&quot; &lt;annworsley991@...&gt;","profile":"ann329851","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: TV- help me understand","postDate":"1214156977","msgId":33911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczbTNiaCtlNWJhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGczbHR0ZStndGhyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33910,"nextInTopic":33916,"prevInTime":33910,"nextInTime":33912,"topicId":33891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I was having difficulty getting it to separate the two voices.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------snip------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question, poll or whathave you about the TV.  I know there was a thread not too long ago, but I wanted some more clarification.<br/>\nI am new at unschooling and still reading, but feel it is the best way<br/>\nto go. (keep in mind my girls are young- ages 2 and 4).  I have noticed<br/>\non many unschooling boards, the TV is not limited for children, and I<br/>\nwould like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to unschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n--------------------snip---------------<br/>\nWhen I first started exploring unschooling we were living in Japan. Simon&#39;s love of Pokemon was born in Japan. We used to watch the English versions and the Japanese versions that were offered on Japanese television.  He loved them. They spun off into this amazing imaginative world. He and David used to duel using the Pokemon they could dream up and the attacks that they could either remember or that they could imagine. He created his own superhero who would rescue animals and pokemon from dangerous situations that I made up for him. He was so much fun to watch flying around the apartment rescuing stuffed animals and pokemon figurines. His play was all his own. No different from the cops and robbers games my brother used to play or the cowboys and indians games that my dad played. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen the amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>\n---------------snip------------------<br/>\nI don&#39;t actually feel that television watching is unhealthy. There are times when I notice that my children seem to be searching for something interesting in their lives. And it may be when I am noticing them skimming through channels more than usual, or more frustrated than usual. When that happens I try and have more things to do on offer. I look through the house for ideas or on the internet for new places to go. And I spice up our lives a little more. I don&#39;t rein in their television watching though. <br/>\n----------------snip------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>\nprompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh and I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was fine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>\nchildren the option of watching however much TV they want is like<br/>\nthrowing cocaine to a drug user and saying, you can have however much you want until you&#39;ve had your fill...  they do believe that children will eventually self- regulate their TV watching on their own as they grow older, but their point is- at what cost - losing so much time out of their childhood, etc etc.  I realize that that is a bit extreme... still processing this.<br/>\n------------------snip------------------<br/>\nGiven your response it seems like you feel that television is an evil to begin with and the book you read feed into all of those fears. I would recommend not reading those kinds of books for a while. Try reading books like Everything Bad is Good for You or Never Too Late: My Musical Life Story. Books that will help you to expand your world and dispell your prejudices rather than books that feed into your worst fears. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------snip------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>\ngotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>\nfrom morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>\nafter video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>\nhow to operate our media center and turns it on herself .<br/>\n-----------------snip--------------------------------<br/>\nWow, your prejudices do run deep. &quot;Not anything educational mind you&quot;? I learn a heck of a lot from non-documentary television. Give us an example of one of your non-educational movies and I bet you the folks here could create a unit study from that movie. Learning happens everywhere, all the time. What you dismiss as not educational may produce a greater understanding of things than the educational programming that you might prefer. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------snip---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the studies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And  basically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being watched- even if its &#39;educational&#39; , there is an impact on the developing brain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is impeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the future...<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------snip-------------<br/>\nQuit reading the studies. It isn&#39;t good for you. You are freaking yourself out and that can&#39;t keep you calm and happy and engaging with your children. The studies that you are reading are out of date. The AAP also recommends not co-sleeping, and I&#39;m sure a bunch of other things that you might not agree with.  Quit worrying about it and sit down and watch television with your daughters. Quit spending time feeling like what they are enjoying is damaging them and enjoy it with them. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------snip----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote from Jane Healy:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Neuroscientists have shown that environmental experiences<br/>\nsignificantly shape the developing brain because of the plasticity of<br/>\nits neuronal connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus in a<br/>\nchild&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental and emotional growth,<br/>\neither by setting up particular circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by<br/>\ndepriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>\n— close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>\ninteractive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>\nopportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation — enhance<br/>\nthe brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>\npassivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>\ndeprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>\nrelationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>\nhave deleterious and irrevocable consequences. &quot;<br/>\n--------------------snip----------------<br/>\nSo love on your kids, cuddle them, hang out with them, play with them, chat with them, sit with them, hold them while they are watching television.  Give them the close interaction that she speaks about and don&#39;t hit them and yell at them. My kids have had repeated exposure to me, I&#39;m a stimulus, all their lives. I don&#39;t know if that has set up &quot;habits of mind&quot; or not, but they don&#39;t seem to write a bunch of papers on how mothers should swap out children so that they don&#39;t engrave themselves on their brains. Lots of people just don&#39;t like television and they want to prove that it is a force for evil. People didn&#39;t used to like novels and the arguments against them were much the same. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------snip-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>\nstarted speaking better after we got rid of the TV initially- which I<br/>\nbelieve led to simply more chances for her to practice her language<br/>\ninstead of being a passive listener. So now that their has been a<br/>\nrevival of videos being watched in our home... I worry again how it is<br/>\naffecting her brain and language again.<br/>\n--------------snip----------------<br/>\nIf you are worried about her speaking talk to her. Engage with her. Talk about what she&#39;s watching. Watch it with her and share it with her. Be curious with her. The timing might very well have been coincidence. Give her the benefit of the doubt.<br/>\n------------snip------------<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.motherin\">http://www.motherin</a> g.com/articles/ growing_child/ consumerism/ turn_off_ tv.&#92;<br/>\nhtml<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.motherin\">http://www.motherin</a> g.com/articles/ growing_child/ consumerism/ turn_off_ tv&#92;<br/>\n.html&gt;<br/>\n--------------------snip--------------------<br/>\nThese kind of articles love to paint the picture that television produces violence. David, my husband, spent a lot of time looking at studies showing<br/>\nsome relationship between violent behavior and television watching and<br/>\nfound that the effect size is actually very small. That is that the<br/>\nrecorded change in behavior is minor. He also found that the studies<br/>\ndidn&#39;t really describe violence very clearly. What may have been interpreted as violence might have been kids pretending to shoot each other and making shooting noises. There wasn&#39;t any statement that the violence is actually hitting each other. <br/>\nMy favorite response to statements that television causes violence is from Deb Lewis: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/t/violence.html.\">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/violence.html.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------snip-------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>\na break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the short-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>\ngreater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations, creating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive recipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>\n--------------------snip--------------------<br/>\nAre you using television as a way to take a break from your kids? I don&#39;t. I often will sit and watch television with them and we chat about it and laugh and it spins off into interesting discussions and explorations. They watch shows over and over again. Simon particularly has been interested in watching certain comedy shows a lot lately. It is interesting to see how it is forming his understanding of humor and the timing of a punch line. There is a lot of creative exploration going on with the television or videos offering a contextualisation for him. <br/>\n<br/>\nTelevision is another moment of sharing, of hanging out, of opportunity to be together, to snuggle, to joke, to smile.  Read here for more about that: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/t/sharing\">http://sandradodd.com/t/sharing</a><br/>\n------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of that article?  I have found this to be true- that<br/>\nmy children&#39;s imaginations are much more rich and organic when there isn&#39;t the constant TV shows playing in their heads for them to act out.  They play much better by themselves without TV.  And I do think my 4 year old gets over stimulated by the TV, much like when she was younger... I have read studies linking TV to ADHD and I think her sensory processing issues may have something to do with heavy TV as a baby (baby einstein videos!!)<br/>\n---------------snip----------------------<br/>\nYou see what you want to see. There was a great experiment about parents who were told that their children had eaten lots of sugar at a party reporting that their kids were on a sugar high. The party hadn&#39;t had any sugary foods, just lots of fun things going on. Parents were interpreting what they believed would happen given their own preconceived notions. <br/>\nTelevision isn&#39;t going to give someone ADHD. The studies that demonstrate a link between ADHD and television watching between the ages of 1 and 3 aren&#39;t showing any kind of causal link. That is there is no way of knowing that television watching produces ADHD or if ADHD leads to a preference to watch more television.  And, hey, look here&#39;s a study that debunks the earlier study: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/07/broadcasting.medicineandhealth\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/07/broadcasting.medicineandhealth</a><br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5rw69t\">http://tinyurl.com/5rw69t</a> if that one is too long). <br/>\n------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSO- I guess the bottom line is- I want my children to be healthy; that<br/>\nis why we don&#39;t normally go through the drive thru&#39;s and I have gotten my children used to a diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, and sprouted whole grains from early on.  They don&#39;t know any different.  They probably think every other kid also drinks green smoothies for<br/>\nbreakfast.  So how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t they get used to doing other more meaningful, developmentally approapriate things for their age- such as playing in the mud?  Why not just make videos unavailable at home during this developmental period in their little lives?  I am not talking about shielding them from watching TV at their grandmothers house or when their over with friends.  I allow my children to have cake at birthday parties and such too....<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly controlling their food intake may not make them healthier. Children have very different food requirements to adults.  Brain development requires more fats and sugars than does the more maintenance oriented work that adults bodies require. And what are you going to do when they realize that not all kids drink green smoothies for breakfast and they want to try the other breakfast options? <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea, who haven&#39;t had food limited or arranged so that they eat a diet that is mostly fruits and vegetables and sprouted whole grains have been eating raspberries from the raspberry canes that are all around the garden and both are impatiently wanted to go to the pick-your-own strawberry places as soon as they are open and it isn&#39;t pissing down with rain. Actually, today it is blowing a gale, but maybe we can go and fill our punnets and our bellies with good English strawberries. Simon wants to bake a pie. For both of them there is no sense that any one food is better than any other food. They know nutrition, but they if they are hungry for cheese puffs or for a peanut wat or a bean burrito or an ice cream sandwich (a rare good as they don&#39;t sell them in the UK) their craving has more information in it than does the ingredients list on the wrapper. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how is the TV any different?  If they don&#39;t have it, then<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t they get used to doing other more meaningful, developmentally approapriate things for their age- such as playing in the mud?

I am not talking about shielding them from watching TV at their grandmothers house or when their over with friends.  I allow my children to have cake at birthday parties and such too....<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\nWho are you to decide what is meaningful for someone else? For Linnaea watching Raven for the 5th time can be more meaningful than playing with the knot tying cards that I just pulled out, sometimes. For Simon, when he was 2, watching Tellytubbies all snuggled in my arms while we both shouted &quot;again, again&quot; was far more meaningful than listening to the Very Hungry Caterpillar or playing in the mud outside. Not that those things didn&#39;t happen also, but those moments with the Tellytubbies were very special to him. And if I had decided that my opinion, my view of his world was more important than his own, surely I would be producing a child as the article you mentioned fearfully warns has a &quot;greater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are less capable of amusing themselves.&quot; <br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I want to increase the amount of reading time, outside play<br/>\ntime, and creative making time.  BTW, I have been seeing a great<br/>\ndecrease in the amount of whining in my 4 year old because i have been consistanly working on our relationship and trying to say &#39;YES&quot; every time she asks for things... so saying no to the TV is going to be a<br/>\nconflict.... any ideas for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to say no to the television to increase the amount of reading time, outside play time and creative making time. Often the television accompanies some of that in our house. Creative time and the television combine quite nicely. Drawing, painting, making sculptures with playdoh, using candles to create wax shapes, typing on an old typewriter, building with hama beads, building with legos, building with blocks, dancing, playing games, playing dress-up, face painting, caring for animals, and more, we&#39;ve done with the television on.  Offering to read or to go outside and play hopscotch or jump rope or go to a cool nature reserve or go to the zoo or whatever it is that you want to do outside, those things don&#39;t have to mean excluding the television.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy limiting their choices to what you want them to do they won&#39;t ever get to choose freely what they want to do.  And there will come a point where they are no longer living only under your roof. They will be making their choices based on the desire to have a limited good rather than on the desire to do or not to do.  Pam Sooroshian gave a wonderful response once about how limiting a good can change it&#39;s worth: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html.\">http://www.sandradodd.com/t/economics.html.</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":275818265,"authorName":"Therese","from":"&quot;Therese&quot; &lt;theresefranklin@...&gt;","profile":"luvmy2gifts","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"TV- help me understand","postDate":"1214115471","msgId":33891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcza3FxZitrZnQ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":33897,"prevInTime":33890,"nextInTime":33892,"topicId":33891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I have a question, poll or whathave you about the TV.

I know there was<br/>\na thread not too long ago, but I wanted some more clarification.<br/>\nI am new at unschooling and still reading, but feel it is the best way<br/>\nto go. (keep in mind my girls are young- ages 2 and 4).  I have noticed<br/>\non many unschooling boards, the TV is not limited for children, and I<br/>\nwould like to know more about how big a roll the TV plays in regards to<br/>\nunschooling little ones.  I realize this can differ from family to<br/>\nfamily.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your younger children watch it- how much of it and how do you lessen<br/>\nthe amount of TV if you feel its not healthy - mentally and physically?<br/>\n<br/>\nI had recently read a book called, &#39;The Plug in Drug&#39;, and it had<br/>\nprompted me to cancel our TV satellite service a while back... which Dh<br/>\nand I  weren&#39;t really watching anyways, so we turned it off and it was<br/>\nfine.  The book basically feels that TV is like a drug, and giving<br/>\nchildren the option of watching however much TV they want is like<br/>\nthrowing cocaine to a drug user and saying, you can have however much<br/>\nyou want until you&#39;ve had your fill...  they do believe that children<br/>\nwill eventually self- regulate their TV watching on their own as they<br/>\ngrow older, but their point is- at what cost - losing so much time out<br/>\nof their childhood, etc etc.  I realize that that is a bit extreme...<br/>\nstill processing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with my little ones, we have moved from TV shows to movies.  While<br/>\nwe don&#39;t have TV shows, they love to watch movies all day, and we have<br/>\ngotten in the habit of watching 4-6 videos during the course of the day<br/>\nfrom morning to evening.  Lately they have been wanting to watch video<br/>\nafter video (not anything educational mind you).  My 4 year old knows<br/>\nhow to operate our media center and turns it on herself .<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I again went back to reading and started to worry about some of the<br/>\nstudies done, such as reasons the AAP recommends no TV under 2.  And <br/>\nbasically studies say that no matter what type of matierial is being<br/>\nwatched- even if its &#39;educational&#39;, there is an impact on the developing<br/>\nbrain connections in young children.  And I worry that the TV is<br/>\nimpeding my 2 year olds language development, possible ADHD in the<br/>\nfuture...<br/>\n<br/>\nQuote from Jane Healy:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Neuroscientists have shown that environmental experiences<br/>\nsignificantly shape the developing brain because of the plasticity of<br/>\nits neuronal connectivity. Thus, repeated exposure to any stimulus in a<br/>\nchild&#39;s environment may forcibly impact mental and emotional growth,<br/>\neither by setting up particular circuitry (&quot;habits of mind&quot;) or by<br/>\ndepriving the brain of other experiences. While appropriate stimuli<br/>\n close interaction with loving caregivers; an enriched,<br/>\ninteractive, human language environment; engrossing hands-on play<br/>\nopportunities; and age-appropriate academic stimulation  enhance<br/>\nthe brain&#39;s development, environments that encourage intellectual<br/>\npassivity and maladaptive behavior (e.g., impulsivity, violence), or<br/>\ndeprive the brain of important chances to participate actively in social<br/>\nrelationships, creative play, reflection and complex problem-solving may<br/>\nhave deleterious and irrevocable consequences.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 2 year old wasn&#39;t speaking very much, and I really think that she<br/>\nstarted speaking better after we got rid of the TV initially- which I<br/>\nbelieve led to simply more chances for her to practice her language<br/>\ninstead of being a passive listener. So now that their has been a<br/>\nrevival of videos being watched in our home... I worry again how it is<br/>\naffecting her brain and language again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a mothering article that struck me; <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv.&#92;\">http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv.&#92;</a><br/>\nhtml<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv&#92;\">http://www.mothering.com/articles/growing_child/consumerism/turn_off_tv&#92;</a><br/>\n.html&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Many children become habituated to TV by their parents, who desire<br/>\na break from their child&#39;s activity and attention. However, the<br/>\nshort-term benefit of a quiet, mesmerized child may actually lead to a<br/>\ngreater dependence on adult supervision by creating children who are<br/>\nless capable of amusing themselves. By supplanting their imaginations,<br/>\ncreating fast-paced pictures, and transforming active minds into passive<br/>\nrecipients, TV teaches mental lethargy. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think of that article?  I have found this to be true- that<br/>\nmy children&#39;s imaginations are much more rich and organic when there<br/>\nisn&#39;t the constant TV shows playing in their heads for them to act out. <br/>\nThey play much better by themselves without TV.  And I do think my 4<br/>\nyear old gets over stimulated by the TV, much like when she was<br/>\nyounger... I have read studies linking TV to ADHD and I think her<br/>\nsensory processing issues may have something to do with heavy TV as a<br/>\nbaby (baby einstein videos!!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSO- I guess the bottom line is- I want my children to be healthy; that<br/>\nis why we don&#39;t normally go through the drive thru&#39;s and I have gotten<br/>\nmy children used to a diet of mostly fruits and vegetables, and sprouted<br/>\nwhole grains from early on.
