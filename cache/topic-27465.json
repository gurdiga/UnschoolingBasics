Doesn&#39;t the thought of someone wanting you to like  <br/>\nsuch a vague thing that doesn&#39;t in itself have much meaning make it  <br/>\nsound really dull?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if someone says &quot;Hey, I saw this really cool show on [some thing  <br/>\nthat you&#39;re passionate about]&quot; wouldn&#39;t you want to see it?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly schools need to worry about reading because they have people who  <br/>\nwill take away their funding if they can&#39;t show that the kids are  <br/>\nlearning to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers live life. Part of life includes TV shows and real people  <br/>\nand games and books about things the kids are interested in. Learning  <br/>\nto read is a by product of wanting to explore what interests them.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading for reading&#39;s sake is as dull as watching documentaries for  <br/>\ndocumentary&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe I should have never<br/>\n&gt; given them so much freedom to learn on their own?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you believe the schools are doing any better? Do you think  <br/>\nevery 9 yo in school is reading? And writing? Yeah, they wish. The  <br/>\nschools take credit for kids learning to read, but when kids are in a  <br/>\nprint rich environment with nurturing parents, the kids will read  <br/>\nwhen they&#39;re developmentally able. (Thousands of unschooled kids are  <br/>\ntestament to this.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat schools do is rob kids of the realization that they can read  <br/>\nwithout being taught and then torture the ones who would naturally  <br/>\nread later into believing they&#39;re broken and too stupid to do what  <br/>\n&quot;everyone&quot; else is doing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That doesn&#39;t seem to bother my kids<br/>\n&gt; too much but it bothers me!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think their happiness isn&#39;t enough of a clue that they&#39;re  <br/>\nhappy?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a serious question to ponder. I think another damaging thing  <br/>\nschools, and society in general, is to get us to believe that we  <br/>\ncan&#39;t know what&#39;s true by our own observation. We need experts to  <br/>\ntell us. We can&#39;t supposedly know when a child is sick. We can&#39;t  <br/>\nsupposedly know when a child is learning properly.

Would you <br/>\nlet him, or would you throw your hands up in horror? <br/>\n<br/>\nBy then end of the day, algebra can be learnt when he&#39;s 20.

Even if I can take <br/>\nthat degree course now, I couldn&#39;t possibly afford the pay cut and <br/>\ntime and the energy to start my career all over again, in the fashion <br/>\nworld. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen so many people having to pick a degree course, just because <br/>\nthey&#39;ve came to that stage of thier life where they have to, they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know what they want, so it&#39;s a case of &quot;just pick one&quot;. Went <br/>\nthru the whole uni thing and graduate with a degree. then realised <br/>\nit&#39;s not what they want.

I do understand how you feel as I have been struggling with<br/>\nthe same thoughts lately also. My children are a lot younger but non the<br/>\nless I fell so worried and full of doubt about this process. My kids are<br/>\n12, 9, 7, & 5 and we have always, for the most part, unschooled- I<br/>\nprobably would be defined eclectic- modestly- with strong unschoolong<br/>\ntendancies. My 9 yr old is not reading very well and writing is a<br/>\nnon-interest for the most part. She is not very articulate and really<br/>\nstruggles to explain herself clearly so she often (always has) been very<br/>\nintroverted. I try to talk with her about the benefits of reading and<br/>\nencourage her to work on it but she resents me for it and has begun to<br/>\nfeel concerned herself (i feel so guilty about that). I feel like I<br/>\nstarted out with such great intentions but now it&#39;s a snowball going<br/>\ndownhill and no matter how hard I try I can&#39;t stop it. I &#39;ve considered<br/>\nadding more structure and stuff to the day but my kids (all of them) are<br/>\ntoo smart for that- they won&#39;t have any of it! They are unschoolers and<br/>\nthey know it- so Mom has to regress- I feel very out of control and<br/>\nunhappy(some days) with what I have allowed. Maybe I should have never<br/>\ngiven them so much freedom to learn on their own? Please don&#39;t bash me-<br/>\ni&#39;m just another loving mom trying to find the right path- handle me<br/>\nwith kindness huh? hehe It doesn&#39;t help that DH really isn&#39;t on board<br/>\neither. He thinks we should have more order- our order! ha! that&#39;s a<br/>\njoke! We have very little opportunity to get out since I also sit for a<br/>\nlittle one during the week and out car is too small to fit her so we are<br/>\nhome with really no friends around. That doesn&#39;t seem to bother my kids<br/>\ntoo much but it bothers me! With very little money I am always worried<br/>\nand distracted. Arghhh! I need perspective too. Burned out is a great<br/>\ndescription of how I am feeling also. Maybe it helps just to know that<br/>\nothers feel that way also.

Learnt all those <br/>\nbad words via Grand Theft Auto. Learnt how to drive on the ride side <br/>\nof the road in Simpsons and learnt about nuclear plants too.  We went <br/>\nvisiting musuems, leanrt alot about ancient civilization, about <br/>\nbones. We learnt what skiing is about, tried it and not too sure <br/>\nabout it. We also learnt that to stay the whole day in pjs is fun and <br/>\nok, because who cares what other people thinks. We also leanrt that <br/>\nit&#39;s common sense to change out of our pjs, if we need to go out, <br/>\nbecause we would look silly if we go shopping in our pjs LOL!

As <br/>\nmuch as I hate to admit it, I seem to care too much what other people think.  I know that&#39;s <br/>\na common issue.  It seems to be cropping up in other areas of my life recently.  Funny... <br/>\ntwice today I have found myself talking about this.  Caring too much about how others <br/>\nthink about us is causing me great stress that I don&#39;t need.  I have heard of a book (years <br/>\nago) called something like It&#39;s None Of Your Business What Other People Think Of You.  <br/>\nSomething like that.  I should hunt that down and read it.  And I&#39;m realizing more and <br/>\nmore to help with some of those uncomfortable moment when people ask questions is to <br/>\nhave answers ready ahead of time.  Be prepared so that I don&#39;t have to fear or avoid.  <br/>\nCause I think I&#39;m darn well ready to put this crap to rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut more than that... I worry about my son.  I try to find rest in the fact that he has always <br/>\nbeen a late bloomer.  He&#39;s immature for being 14.  I worked with an educational counselor <br/>\nfor the Moore Academy (as in Dorothy and Raymond Moore) ... a very wise eldery woman <br/>\nwho I highly respect would remind me of his immaturity and to accept him and support <br/>\nhim where he is.  I try to do that.  But from time to time fear crops up that I need to be <br/>\ndoing more... that he needs to be doing more.  All of Austyn&#39;s friends are in school.  When <br/>\nI hear them talk about their school work I sometimes freak out ... not that they&#39;re talking <br/>\nalot about school.  Sometimes they  mention a tough day or a quick blurb about <br/>\nsomething they&#39;re doing.  And  occasionally it&#39;s conversations with other homeschoolers <br/>\nwho do more traditional schooling.  Anyway, Austyn is not a reader.  Never has been... <br/>\nmaybe never will be.  Even when he was a little boy he didn&#39;t care to be read to much.  His <br/>\nfavorite books most of the time were hands on types of books with pop ups or things to <br/>\ndo or find.  Guess that should be my first clue.  A few years back he was in a reading <br/>\nprogram for a year where he went twice a week.  It was a kind of hands on type of <br/>\nprogram that was really good.  It helped him a lot but he still finds it difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admire all of you who are able to trust this process... trust yourselves... and trust your <br/>\nchild.

We were cruising along, doing the sequential<br/>\nhistory thing, somewhere maybe in the Renaissance (iirc), when ds<br/>\nasked if, when we got a chance, could we please learn about WWII.  (He<br/>\nhad been playing Battlefield 1942 on the computer.)  Rather than tell<br/>\nhim to wait for it, we switched gears immediately, went to the<br/>\nlibrary, got WWII for Dummies (or Idiot&#39;s Guide to WWII -- I can&#39;t<br/>\nremember which), and had a cool time learning about it.  (As I had<br/>\nnever had it in school, we really were both learning, too!)  We<br/>\ndiscussed things, saw parallels between what we were reading and Star<br/>\nTrek: Deep Space 9 (we were watching it, and were up to the parts with<br/>\nthe Dominion.)  When we got to the battle of Stalingrad, he excitedly<br/>\nsaid, &quot;That&#39;s exactly how it plays out in the game!&quot;  Life was good!<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, too, that there is nothing fixed about WHEN a particular<br/>\nsubject needs to be learned.  Nothing fixed that says he HAS to<br/>\ngraduate on such and such a day.  Those are things that can be changed<br/>\nup and down, as appropriate.  What if he doesn&#39;t learn algebra until<br/>\nhe is 16?  Will his world end?  (I hope not, as I assume he lives in<br/>\nthe same one I do!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe may find he learns these things better through concrete means, when<br/>\nthey come up in things he enjoys doing.  From my observations, I think<br/>\na lot of teens (and especially boys) really like to have some<br/>\nconcrete, real-world connections, something that they are contributing<br/>\nin a real way, not abstract paper pushing.  (And this holds true for<br/>\nacademically-oriented kids, like my son.)  He may need to see the real<br/>\nuse of it before he fully grasps it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may graduate with huge honkin&#39; holes.  That&#39;s okay.  I graduated<br/>\nfrom public school with huge honkin&#39; holes, too (see the bit about<br/>\nWWII -- that wasn&#39;t the only hole), and managed fine.  The important<br/>\nthing is that he knows how to fill those holes as he needs/wants to!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when those ugly fears raise their ugly heads, ask yourself, &quot;What<br/>\nharm is there if he doesn&#39;t get all these things by the age of 18? <br/>\nWill I kick him out then?  Will he be doomed to a destitute life?&quot; <br/>\nOdds are, no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;healthunlimited1&quot;<br/>\n&lt;healthunlimited1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been lurking around this list for a while.

(By the way, he&#39;s never written a report or any<br/>\n&gt; kind of paper in <br/>\n&gt; his life.)  His math is less than desirable as well.  He&#39;s got the basics down<br/>\n&gt; pretty well for <br/>\n&gt; the most part be he&#39;s of the age where he should be doing algebra ... I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; think so!!   I <br/>\n&gt; realize that I have tried to fit a round peg in a square hole by making him do<br/>\n&gt; traditional <br/>\n&gt; types of school work.  As of two weeks ago I threw the curriculum out the<br/>\n&gt; window (a very <br/>\n&gt; expensive lesson for mom!).  Other than helping me out with things around the<br/>\n&gt; house and <br/>\n&gt; with my business, he spends his time playing World of Warcraft (greatly<br/>\n&gt; responsible for <br/>\n&gt; improving his reading skills amongst other things as he is a brilliant game<br/>\n&gt; player) and he <br/>\n&gt; plays his drums...very well I might add and always on his own.  I&#39;ve never<br/>\n&gt; pushed it ... <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s  his own baby.  We have been playing a lot of board games as well since<br/>\n&gt; we threw <br/>\n&gt; out the curriculum.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what&#39;s the problem?  Where do I begin!!  I&#39;ve been freaking out because<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got the <br/>\n&gt; mind set of things counting towards graduation.  And what about college?! I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been <br/>\n&gt; able to relax and trust this process.  I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s the right<br/>\n&gt; thing.  And God <br/>\n&gt; forbid if someone asks him or I what he&#39;s doing in school.  I think we both<br/>\n&gt; panick.  If I <br/>\n&gt; could feel confident in what we&#39;re doing I&#39;m sure it would help him feel<br/>\n&gt; confident as well.  I<br/>\n&gt; go about my day wondering what the heck we&#39;re doing.  Oh my gosh... and then I<br/>\n&gt; just die <br/>\n&gt; when I hear my son announce to his friends &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything today&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; Geez.... don&#39;t say<br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;ll tell him.  You let the wrong person hear that and we&#39;ll have the<br/>\n&gt; authorities <br/>\n&gt; snooping around.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well... this is a good start.  Trust me... I could go on and on but I&#39;ll let<br/>\n&gt; it go at this.  For<br/>\n&gt; once in my homeschooling career I&#39;d like to be confident in what we&#39;re doing<br/>\n&gt; and just <br/>\n&gt; relax.  I&#39;m tired and burned out.... and it shows at home as my creativity<br/>\n&gt; across the board <br/>\n&gt; is spent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Shileen<br/>\n&gt; ----------------<br/>\nZoa Conner, PhD<br/>\nPhysicist and Montessori Homeschooling Mother<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zoaconner@...\">zoaconner@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279243764,"authorName":"Tequitia Andrews","from":"&quot;Tequitia Andrews&quot; &lt;andrewstequitia@...&gt;","profile":"tequitia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Burned out!","postDate":"1193939029","msgId":27469,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZnZDM4bCtkdHRyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZnYnJtMCs5ZGZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27468,"nextInTopic":27470,"prevInTime":27468,"nextInTime":27470,"topicId":27465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hang in there.

I&#39;m new to this unschooling process myself.  My kids <br/>\nare much younger, but I too cringe when I overhear them telling a <br/>\nrelative we didn&#39;t do anything.  I feel the need to step in and <br/>\nelaborate on the issue.  But I do realize that we have to get out of <br/>\nthat mentality of what will others think.  Homeschooling is not <br/>\ntraditional schooling as we know it.  We have the freedoms to run it <br/>\npretty much any way we want, Thank God for that.  We have to have <br/>\nconfidence in ourselves and our decisions for our family.  We can&#39;t <br/>\nallow others to dictate how to run our homes.

I have not posted because it&#39;s hard to <br/>\nknow where to begin while at the same time not turning my post into a book ... LOL  This <br/>\nis my 14th year of homeschooling.  I have one son in college and I have one son who is <br/>\ntechnically in 9th grade.  Over th years I feel like we&#39;ve done it all or at least tried.  I&#39;ve <br/>\ndabbled in unschooling.  When my oldest was in 9th grade we pretty much unschooled <br/>\nthat year.  He refers to that year as the year we didn&#39;t do anything.  Interestingly, that was <br/>\nthe year that he finally learned  how to play guitar after trying a couple of times years <br/>\nprior.  His music is very important to him ... he is in a band and I love to hear the songs he <br/>\nhas written.  We have not truly unschooled since that year.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I&#39;m just at a loss.  My youngest son although in 9th grade does not read or write <br/>\nwell.  He does improve each year but he is far from 9th grade material.  You can imagine <br/>\nhow this affects everything. (By the way, he&#39;s never written a report or any kind of paper in <br/>\nhis life.)  His math is less than desirable as well.  He&#39;s got the basics down pretty well for <br/>\nthe most part be he&#39;s of the age where he should be doing algebra ... I don&#39;t think so!!   I <br/>\nrealize that I have tried to fit a round peg in a square hole by making him do traditional <br/>\ntypes of school work.  As of two weeks ago I threw the curriculum out the window (a very <br/>\nexpensive lesson for mom!).  Other than helping me out with things around the house and <br/>\nwith my business, he spends his time playing World of Warcraft (greatly responsible for <br/>\nimproving his reading skills amongst other things as he is a brilliant game player) and he <br/>\nplays his drums...very well I might add and always on his own.  I&#39;ve never pushed it ... <br/>\nthat&#39;s  his own baby.  We have been playing a lot of board games as well since we threw <br/>\nout the curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what&#39;s the problem?  Where do I begin!!  I&#39;ve been freaking out because I&#39;ve got the <br/>\nmind set of things counting towards graduation.  And what about college?! I haven&#39;t been <br/>\nable to relax and trust this process.  I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s the right thing.  And God <br/>\nforbid if someone asks him or I what he&#39;s doing in school.
