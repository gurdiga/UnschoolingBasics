That kind of thinking is a wedge between you and your child. Endurance, patience, bearing with it - none of that goes nearly far enough. Find things to love about Star Wars. It doesn&#39;t have to be everything, but enough to get you past endurance to actually being able to enjoy what your child is interested in. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpongebob, the Eds, Skateboarding, and Death Metal are all things I&#39;ve thought at one point &quot;I can&#39;t stand it&quot;. Getting past that took an effort of will. Its easy to stay stuck at &quot;can&#39;t&quot;. Its easy to say &quot;I&#39;ll lose my mind&quot; - do it! Lose your mind!

Let him feel his feelings and express them. Say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and mean it.

He Needs so much more than he will when he&#39;s had a chance to heal. Pushing back against his needs is like making a baby wait, or cry - it doesn&#39;t help him. Yes, that means your needs go on the back burner for awhile, but only for awhile - six months to a year. That may be longer than you expected! If so, its important to change your perspective and the way you get your needs met so you&#39;re not burning out while Also being kind and gentle of your son&#39;s healing process. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: getting MY feet wet while WE deschool...

Your normal -- drop him off and have all that lovely time to do things.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow? Not so much. For either of you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he&#39;s very young. 7 is young to understand whether or not this is really how things are going to be now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this IS how things are going to be, maybe your DS needs know that. To be explicitly told that, you know, this isn&#39;t just a vacation, just a temporary thing. That you have all kinds of time and all of Star Wars or anything else doesn&#39;t need to be conquered in a day. And that you&#39;ll want to think of other things you&#39;d like to do -- as time goes on. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike what? Well, we could go get a pumpkin and carve it. That and some Star Wars. Sounds like a fine day. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr go get the candy for the trick-or-treaters. And some cool Star Wars bags to put the candy in. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Now I have to start some laundry. Or load the dishwasher. But I&#39;m right here and will be right back and isn&#39;t this great that we get to spend all of our days liks this from now on.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd repeat as needed until he gets it -- that you and he are together in this and will try to enjoy each others&#39; company while, of course, getting on with the mundane things that need doing to keep things functioning. And that this is real. Really how you are going to live now so he can relax and enjoy and figure it out with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

I could ooh and aah and drive and buy and let him show me things without actually doing any of it myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is not to stop being you but to facilitate DS in being himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd strewing is a fine idea. But it has to be a natural thing. Not something you thought looked &quot;educational&quot; in the store. And even then. . . DS picked up a book on psychology for DD a few weeks ago. She says she&#39;s interested, he sees the book, he buys it. But she has barely touched it. And I think it&#39;s because she didn&#39;t pick it out herself.

Your son is Right Now and he&#39;s learning Right Now. You get to be a part of that. Let his questions reassure you that he&#39;s not some kind of passive participant, he&#39;s actively engaged in learning (which isn&#39;t to say that kids should be prompted to ask questions or something, its just a plus when it happens).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I am hoping for is to find ways to give him star wars play &gt;that can accomplish other things too...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;ve misunderstood the nature of strewing (or maybe haven&#39;t heard of it) but the goal of offering more is to support his passions and keep life fresh and interesting, not to find ways to sneak learning into kids. Get him things you think he&#39;d like the same way you might pick up a little something for a friend because you just Know so-and-so would love it.

I want to be supportive of his love of star wars but if we continue on the route of playing the same scenes every day I am going to lose my mind... I just want to open up the world for him more... show him more options within his love of star wars... and break it up for myself at the same time... and yes, If I can get something or make something that would work as cookie cutters so he can make star wars cookies and star wars ornaments... I know that thats all it would take for him to get into something... then Im gonna go for it... because monotony is not good.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My main goal is get him thinking outside the box again... like before the school started stiffling him... get him opening his mind more... I know that sounds all so &#39;controlling&#39; but really Im trying to help him unlock and free up whats been repressed ... I dont know if this is making any sense at all&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\nFirst, I am going to say that perhaps you are the one that needs to open your mind and unlock what has been repressed. I say that because the idea of supporting a kid that is doing the same thing all the time can be foreign to somebody that is in the deschooling process. I know that I still have scripts in my head from when I was a kid. I feel like society pushes variety. It is a whole lot easier to support your child doing the same thing everyday if you see it as valuable. If you step away from the idea that you have to have variety, it might be easier to do the same thing every day. Do you wake up every day thinking, &quot;Oh my, are we going to play that same scene again today?&quot; or do you wake up thinking, &quot;Wow, I wonder if we are going to play that same scene today? I thought of something that I could add to the scene that might make it more interesting.&quot; A small change in how you think about playing those same things can have a huge impact on how bearable a situation is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all that, I do try to find ways of changing things up a bit. I get in ruts because it can sometimes be hard to think of things to do that are outside the box. When I want a change, I always suggest that we go shopping to look for more stuff that fits their current interest. We go to thrift stores and toy stores. We get online and look on Amazon or other online sellers. A lot of times, we find stuff that we didn&#39;t know existed. Nothing is more exciting than finding something new that feeds my girls interests. A lot of times, I will go to google shopping and do searches to see what is available. Right now, my girls love Pokemon so we will go do random searches on Pokemon to see what is even available. We have an Amazon wish list that my girls are always populating with stuff that they find interesting. It is a great way for me to see what all they are interested in at any given moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like to sew, perhaps you can offer to sew a costume or make room décor. If he loves the characters, perhaps you can suggest shopping for more characters and accessories for the scenes that he likes to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of times, kids follow the parents lead. With my girls, all I have to do is plant a seed and they run with it. I find that if I open my mind, my girls will fill it with all kinds of ideas. They just have to know that I am open and receptive to whatever it is that they may suggest. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: getting MY feet wet while WE deschool...

Instead, make yourself a note &quot;watched Star Wars<br/>\nepisode 4&quot; and a few notes on the types of questions he asked as it was<br/>\ngoing on. Then corral it all into &#39;educationalese&#39; once a week, once a<br/>\nmonth, whatever. Keep a camera handy maybe to take pictures as he&#39;s<br/>\nbuilding scenarios (and make a note about the story/plotline that he&#39;s<br/>\ndeveloping - plotline, character development, other literary devices<br/>\netc).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to LIKE Star Wars but it&#39;s important to be conversant<br/>\nwith it.

There&#39;s nothing that says you have to stay<br/>\nstill and watch the movie while he&#39;s watching it. Maybe, for your own<br/>\nsake, watch them ahead of time somehow so that you can glance at the<br/>\nscreen and say &quot;Oh this is where Han Solo gets dunked in carbonite...&quot;<br/>\nto answer his question, and then go back to browsing a magazine. Or,<br/>\nbetter yet, do you have a hobby that you can do in parallel (knitting,<br/>\ncross stitch, baking, etc - get the cookie dough ready then start the<br/>\nmovie, pop the first batch in the oven, set the timer, watch 8 minutes<br/>\nof movie, pop one batch out, one in, watch 8 minutes of movie, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, though, if he&#39;s just coming out of schooling, he&#39;s likely<br/>\nneeding a lot of YOU simply because that&#39;s been missing - he&#39;s hungry<br/>\nfor YOU and until he feels satisfied that you&#39;re there, he&#39;s going to<br/>\nkeep wanting more. The resistance he&#39;s probably feeling is likely<br/>\ndriving the zillion questions rapid fire. Look at this time as<br/>\n&quot;courtship&quot; - you&#39;re getting to know each other (again). Could some of<br/>\nyour resistance be that you&#39;re used to having a big old chunk of &quot;quiet<br/>\ntime&quot; to do your own thing while he was doing school and you want that<br/>\nback? That&#39;s not unusual. Again, as in a courtship, it&#39;s a dance as the<br/>\nparties involved seek ways to move together without stepping on toes.<br/>\nWay back when we were newlyweds, for instance, hubby loved playing a<br/>\nparticular computer game. I&#39;m not much into that stuff (plus we had<br/>\nexactly ONE computer back then). I could have made him nuts by trying to<br/>\npull him away from it. He could have made me nuts by trying to make me<br/>\nlove playing. Instead, we set up a space that had a cozy reading space<br/>\nnearby to the computer. I could read, nap, watch him (we were newlyweds<br/>\nafter all lol), pay bills, whatever, while he was playing, and we could<br/>\nchat or just enjoy sharing the space. I was conversant with the game<br/>\nenough to ask appropriate questions or understand his<br/>\nhappiness/frustrations. He&#39;d ask about what I was reading, maybe suggest<br/>\na next thing to read if I was nearing the end, etc. Key thing: there<br/>\nwere no strings attached to suggestions. Could be that those rolled eyes<br/>\nat the idea of &#39;doing camping&#39; feels to him like you&#39;re trying to pull<br/>\nhim away from Star Wars to do something &quot;educational&quot;. That&#39;ll meet with<br/>\nresistance for a time, until he can feel confident that there are no<br/>\nstrings attached to your suggestions (no lesson plans brewing in the<br/>\nback of your mind to make sure that the suggestion is &#39;educational&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as camping, odds are he&#39;s interested in camping but is afraid<br/>\nthat if he goes to do that, he will miss out on his beloved Star Wars in<br/>\nsome way. After all, he&#39;s probably used to limited time with<br/>\nvideos/TV/toys simply because of school stuff having priority. Can you<br/>\nset up a tent in the back yard and make that the base camp on Hoth or<br/>\nLuke&#39;s home on Tattoine? Camping and Star Wars need not be mutually<br/>\nexclusive, KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta say, in the interest of full disclosure, we&#39;re a family of &#39;nerds&#39;<br/>\nas well - it&#39;s a family event to sit down and watch Dr. Who episodes as<br/>\nthey come out (we&#39;ve got all the DVDs for the new series), Star Trek and<br/>\nStar Wars DVDs, etc. Lego Star Wars videogames for the PlayStation, Star<br/>\nWars Monopoly games (both versions), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It seems like you are really <br/>\nchomping at the bit to settle into a more routinised life. It will take time and <br/>\neven with time it will probably end up looking like way more attention being <br/>\nrequired than you may have been expecting to give. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a lot with the more basic household tasks if you come up with easy <br/>\nsolutions. Soaking dishes make them easier to wash, put them in a sink of hot <br/>\nwater and come back a few hours later when you have a couple of minutes and wash <br/>\nthem at that point, put boxes and baskets in corners of rooms so that you can <br/>\nput the things you want to tidy up in them and while you are sitting and <br/>\nwatching, again, a Star Wars movie you can sort through a box or two and figure <br/>\nout where you want things to go. Or you can fold laundry while you answer <br/>\nquestions about all things Jedi. With meals try and come up with quick things to <br/>\neat. Or see if you can get a hold of a crock pot or something and you can put <br/>\nfood on in the morning that you will eat later on in the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe loves being with you, he loves engaging with you. He wants your attention and <br/>\nyour time. That&#39;s a really cool thing. I know a lot of kids who are no longer <br/>\ninterested in being with their parents in any way at all. Whenever you feel <br/>\ntired of being the person he comes to, remember that he is sharing his joy with <br/>\nyou, his special things, his loves and his treasures. It&#39;s a kind of mental spin <br/>\nthat you can sell yourself. Do lots of that. Lots and lots of seeing how <br/>\nconnected he wants to be to you. The more you work to sit with him, the more you <br/>\nwork to engage with him, to listen to his excitement, to ride out the moments <br/>\nwhen you could care less about Darth Maul or whomever, the more he&#39;ll fill up <br/>\nwith love and care and a sense of inner peace. And the less he&#39;ll need you with <br/>\nhim every moment. It&#39;s kind of a game of trust. He is learning to trust you, to <br/>\nknow that you&#39;ll be there all the time, and the more he trusts the less he&#39;ll <br/>\nneed to keep checking that you are still there. The less you are there the more <br/>\nhe&#39;ll have to check for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:findingourway@...\">findingourway@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:findingourway@...\">findingourway@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, 26 October, 2010 2:46:48<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: getting MY feet wet while WE deschool... <br/>\nLooking for ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nagain I think maybe Im not coming across with what Im really trying to say. <br/>\nright now we are adjusting to him being home 24/7... he&#39;s used to having my <br/>\nundivided attention when he gets home from school and now that he&#39;s home all the <br/>\ntime, he is expecting my undivided attention constantly...

A number of weeks ago I began to keep a <br/>\ndiary really to reassure myself that there was some (traditional) <br/>\nlearning going on and so that I could say if required to do so what he <br/>\nhas learned....that idea lasted a week and did reassure cos now I don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel the need and think I could come up with information if asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can empathise with your position, I really struggle to engage with <br/>\nanimation ( a view left over from my childhood, that it is childish and <br/>\nsilly) I also struggle to watch fantasy &#39;violence&#39;.....we live in a <br/>\nsmall open plan house and sometimes I struggle to tolerate the TV being <br/>\non, Charlie likes it on while he is playing, he has started to play in <br/>\nthe living room again just like when he was younger (which is lovely) I <br/>\nam becoming much better at being able to switch the tv off in my <br/>\nhead...but for those times when it gets to much we bought wireless head <br/>\nphones....we don&#39;t use them often....but they can be of use sometimes. <br/>\nIt is a lot to adjust to....I sometimes forget what a huge shift it is <br/>\nfor us all....<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it feels more manageable soon<br/>\nAll good wishes Tori<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I could not focus on answering his questions because he was asking <br/>\n&gt; about what is happening RIGHT NOW on the screen and I cant tell whats <br/>\n&gt; happening because I cant watch it or hear it...

Your son is <br/>\n&gt; Right Now and he&#39;s learning Right Now. You get to be a part of that. <br/>\n&gt; Let his questions reassure you that he&#39;s not some kind of passive <br/>\n&gt; participant, he&#39;s actively engaged in learning (which isn&#39;t to say <br/>\n&gt; that kids should be prompted to ask questions or something, its just a <br/>\n&gt; plus when it happens).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; what I am hoping for is to find ways to give him star wars play <br/>\n&gt; &gt;that can accomplish other things too...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;ve misunderstood the nature of strewing (or maybe haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; heard of it) but the goal of offering more is to support his passions <br/>\n&gt; and keep life fresh and interesting, not to find ways to sneak <br/>\n&gt; learning into kids. Get him things you think he&#39;d like the same way <br/>\n&gt; you might pick up a little something for a friend because you just <br/>\n&gt; Know so-and-so would love it. In some ways, that&#39;s the job of an <br/>\n&gt; unschooling parent – to be the best possible friend.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; its torture living in a Star wars mode 24/7<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The good news is that once you step back from trolling Star Wars for <br/>\n&gt; educational opportunities, you get a little of your own life back. You <br/>\n&gt; can play with him for a while, watch part of a movie, and then take a <br/>\n&gt; break, go make snacks or do something for yourself for a little. He <br/>\n&gt; still needs a lot of your time and energy, but let your time and <br/>\n&gt; energy be about him, rather than about what he is or isn&#39;t learning, <br/>\n&gt; and you won&#39;t feel quite so worn down by all those Clone Troopers ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s one of my all-time-favorite essays by Sandra, on the subject of <br/>\n&gt; how natural learning works:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/puddle\">http://sandradodd.com/puddle</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: getting MY feet wet while WE deschool...

Learning is happening. You do NOT need to quantify it or be able to put it in schoolish learning terms for it to be real. You can NOT know what your child is getting out of what he&#39;s doing - even a very talkative child can&#39;t tell you everything he&#39;s learning, because true learning, natural learning, takes place in bits and pieces, things they might not even notice at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust pay attention to your son. Listen to and answer his questions. Pause the movie if you need to, but you might learn you don&#39;t have to. Seth, at 11, will still talk and ask questions during TV shows and movies. I have learned that NOTHING is more important than the connection I have with him. I turn away from the show, make eye contact, and listen to him, and talk to him. I can watch the videos of the So You Think You Can Dance contestants on youtube the next day, or I can figure out what Dr. Who said, or I can rewind if it seems important. But again, nothing&#39;s more important than the fact that he wants to talk TO ME, right then - certainly not some TV show.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is happening, all the time. You can&#39;t stop it from happening. Trust in it. Trust that whatever he&#39;s learning from whatever he&#39;s doing will add to a life that is meaningful to him. It might not look like a school curriculum - it probably won&#39;t! - and that&#39;s perfectly fine, it doesn&#39;t need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet over the thought that it&#39;s torture to be immersed in Star Wars. Find out what he loves about it. If you can&#39;t love it, love that he loves it. Love it because it brings your son pleasure. This time is fleeting! <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don&#39;t think about Star Wars accomplishing anything else. Star Wars, in and of itself, is valuable. Buy the cookie cutters because you want to bring joy to your son, not because he might learn something through cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as you can, step away from schoolish thinking - then step away some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":468243882,"authorName":"findingourway@mail.com","from":"findingourway@...","profile":"mamapunkerdoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"getting MY feet wet while WE deschool...

He lives eats and breathes Star wars the clone wars and is now starting to expand into the movies as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n So we rented it and he set up his toys and played while it was on... which is common for him he&#39;s very tactile. but he wasnt super interested in the movie other than asking me a million questions while it was playin so I couldnt focus on the movie or on him. BUT when I suggested we watch it another time he didnt want to he wanted to &quot;watch&quot; it now... (he&#39;s 8) so we muddled through and I didnt let myself get too stressed but honestly my brain works best when it can plan things so I was TRYING to watch the movies and watch him play <br/>\n(I had Played WITH him with the action figures for a good chunk of the day) and come up with the actual learning that is taking place AND ways to encourage the learning that can be found in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n I see that there is the &#39;social studies&#39; involved and even some politics and govt (though he&#39;s a bit young to really grasp that yet... he&#39;s getting it sort, through this play so I&#39;ll leave that alone for now) but I guess what Im asking is who else out there has Star wars Kids... lol and what kind of ideas do you implement in the learning within this interest... <br/>\n<br/>\nfor myself, its torture living in a Star wars mode 24/7 but for him I will comply. I know that this interest isnt likely to fade any time soon so what I am hoping for is to find ways to give him star wars play that can accomplish other things too... Like when I get some extra cash I hope to look for star wars cookie cutters that maybe we can bake some chocolate sugar cookies with... and do other crafts with... I have a cool recipe for &#39;clay&#39; made out of baking soda and corn starch that dries hard and white so you can decorate christmas tree ornaments and such... <br/>\n<br/>\nbut his interests are 98% star wars right now. but he&#39;s not crazy about the star wars books because many of the words are too hard for him and the easy ones are boring. he reads well... but is more tactile in his interests and sitting still to read is few and far between. so now that IM rambling and my sentences and thoughts are running into one another...maybe someone out there has star wars fans in their household as well and could share some ideas...<br/>\nBlessings<br/>\nKimberlie<br/>\n<br/>\n[kimberlie - I added some spaces to your post b/c I have a hard time reading too-dense text, hope you don&#39;t mind ---Meredith]<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45321,"nextTopicId":45334}}
