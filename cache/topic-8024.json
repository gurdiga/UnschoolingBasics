One centers around a correspondence program, but it looks like they do send out some good info in regards activities for all area homeschool families, helpful links, etc.  It seems like there are a great number of homeschoolers in the area so it&#39;s just me getting comfortable enough to get out there with Tristan.  It&#39;ll happen but may take just a bit of time.  This is a huge lifestyle change so I think taking it slow is OK by me! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been burying myself in websites and books for quite some time now, not only in regards to unschooling but homeschooling in general.  I happened upon unschooling fairly quickly after I started my research so most of my focus has been on that.  Unschooling just really struck a chord with me.  I truly wish my parents had taken this approach with me when I was a kid.  I remember school as such a miserable experience and am only now regaining that eagerness to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; at our library over the weekend and read it in two evenings and started the original version of &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  I have a few books on order from Amazon that I am really looking forward to receiving.

My name is Malinda, and I have a son Tristan who turned 9 last month and is in the 3rd grade.  Tristan&#39;s always had a rough time in school (unchallenged, bored, disruptive, etc.), but this year things have hit an all-time low.  The school is desperate to label him, and it is beginning to break my son.  My husband and I have decided to withdraw him from public school.  I now just need to pluck up enough courage to tell his school and fill out the necessary paperwork, which I plan to do sometime this week.  Deep down we know this is the best decision, but I have all these nagging worries -- &quot;Are we making the right decision? Are we doing this for the right reasons? What if I fail Tristan and ruin his life?&quot;  You know, all those rational -- and irrational -- that homeschoolers probably think about at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think our biggest concern in withdrawing him from school is socialization, but not in your typical sense of the word.  I&#39;m a very introverted person, and I will really have to work at &quot;getting us out&quot; to various social activities.  Tristan and my husband are both very outgoing.  Tristan is one of the most social, empathic, and sensitive kids I have ever met, but he also has a very strong personality that sometimes turns kids off.  I think that he gets overwhelmed in large groups, and I hope that taking him out of a school environment may help this -- or will it backfire?  <br/>\n<br/>\nA secondary concern is support  (or rather lack there of) for Tristan and myself as we begin our unschooling journey.  Right now my husband is thousands of miles away, fighting in Iraq, and he will be gone for another 9 months or so.  This alone has put both Tristan and I under tremendous stress and pressure; although, we have really pulled together and are getting along better than we ever have.  My parents are my only &quot;immediate&quot; call-them-whenever-I-need-support people right now.  They refuse to accept anything that isn&#39;t mainstream and &quot;normal&quot; in their view of life, and homeschooling is definitely not normal to them.  They see kids that are homeschooled as weird or &quot;freakish.&quot; In regards to Tristan&#39;s problems at school, my parents sympathize for a while but then say he just needs to &quot;buck up&quot; (I loathe this term) and learn how to deal with school. *sigh*  This thinking just saddens me and makes me feel so alone right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted to send an introduction to the group.  Most likely I&#39;ll spend most of my time lurking but wanted to say hello just in case I jump into a thread or ask a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\nFairbanks, Alaska<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8056,"nextTopicId":8054}}
