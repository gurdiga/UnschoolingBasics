My adult kids, now 29 &lt;!?&gt; and 23 both self censored themselves.   <br/>\nMy youngest watches TV but is just as happy to turn it off and play a board game w me or go fro a run /bike ride.    <br/>\nI sometimes feel the need to reminder her or other options but I don&#39;t need to limit her TV, she does that herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know, I have often heard,  &quot;But, my child will do nothing except watch TV if I let her/him!&quot;.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure but I think, <br/>\nbased on observation, this is because they have not had the freedom to take TV watching it their complete fulfillment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust like detoxing from school, if the process is interfered w it takes a lot longer for them to emerge.   Even if a concerned parent says, &quot;Well, I know s/he need to heal from ps, so will let him/her veg for x amount of time but then, I need to ask for some kind of work in &lt;say&gt; just &lt; a little bit of&gt; math&quot;  Zip, the detoxing kid has to start the healing process over.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I came to know unschooling was when my son came out of ps in the beginning of the 10th grade.  At first he wanted a strict schedule that parallel ps&#39;s subjects.   This worked really well for a few weeks.   Then I heard him crying in the middle of the night.   <br/>\nHe said, &quot;Mom, I feel like I have wasted my life!   I have learned more from you and dad than I did in all my years in school&quot; <br/>\n&lt; breaks your heart, doesn&#39;t it?&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThen he crashed.   Luckily I had heard of deschooling and knew what he was doing.   He father was very alarmed.   I could see our son was improving, though, because he started getting his sense of humor back, got along better w sibs, and was voluntarily helping around the house/business. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings me to TV:<br/>\nHe watched A LOT! of TV during this period.   Soon, left on his own, his choices in programs improved.  <br/>\nHe loved Britsh Comedies [ which I feel was his life line since he was so hurt]  <br/>\nDiscovery Channel{ this was a good thing!}, <br/>\nHistory Channel { he knows, not only more history than I ever did in pHs, but he know the cause and effect of historical events}  <br/>\nand PBS.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI knew he was on the right unschooling track when he watched a teachers 3 hr block in the middle of the night on Trigonometry.<br/>\nThe next day he asked me to pick him up a book on Trig!  <br/>\nAnd, yes, he did use it.   He and his dad were always high in math and science.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nDail<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":755,"nextTopicId":770}}
