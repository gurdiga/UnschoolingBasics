They also understand that  sometimes we <br/>\ndon&#39;t.  For example, my husband is overseas and my kids can&#39;t  veto a trip to <br/>\nthe grocery store, but if someone doesn&#39;t want to go &quot;now&quot;, we  discuss that.  <br/>\nThey are also willing to give a little because they see  there are limited <br/>\noptions right now.  My kids, even as little ones, were  never interested in <br/>\nhelping around the house.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have an unschooling friend whose children just always go along.  In  fact, <br/>\nshe can get away with doing some math worksheets and teachy things because  <br/>\nher children are quite happy to do nearly anything she asks.  It isn&#39;t that  she <br/>\nnever considers her children, it is just that she rarely *has* to.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSince I have the kids that I have, I often wonder if it is harder for  people <br/>\nwith more compliant children to know what they need.  Since my  babies <br/>\nrefused to be put down, I always wonder if those &quot;babies in buckets&quot; are  getting <br/>\nenough arm time.  I have had to examine and examine and examine my  motives with <br/>\nmy children to make sure I am reducing the arbitrary  have-to&#39;s and limits so <br/>\nI won&#39;t be forcing them to compromise needlessly.   Other people can *choose* <br/>\nto make these examinations.<br/>\n <br/>\nOf course, this is what led me to unschooling.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229237531,"authorName":"Danielle Conger","from":"Danielle Conger &lt;danielle.conger@...&gt;","profile":"danielleconger","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Another question...","postDate":"1130708699","msgId":7284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNjUzRURCLjcwODA3MDNAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRrM2Excys1bnNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRrM2Excys1bnNmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7283,"nextInTopic":7288,"prevInTime":7283,"nextInTime":7285,"topicId":7234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It is about<br/>\ntrusting the child to learn what they want in his or<br/>\nher own way, at their own leisure. It is up to the<br/>\nunschooling parent to provide for their needs and give<br/>\nthem opportunities to explore their passions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI loved CM and went to that in my first year of<br/>\nhomeschooling.  However, even though it is an awesome<br/>\nmethod, it still separates &quot;school time from free<br/>\ntime.&quot;  That method leaves the afternoon for exploring<br/>\ninterest.  It&#39;s a great method! Gentle, relaxed,<br/>\ninterest led, but it is not unschooling.  Unschooling<br/>\nhappens 365/7 and all hours of the day, it is never<br/>\nlimited by &quot;what must be done&quot; or what we parents deem<br/>\nis important.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t push her, she initiates, I initiate, but it&#39;s<br/>\nher interest in what we do that determines what and<br/>\nhow long.  She&#39;s gone longer periods (entire summer<br/>\nand early fall) without reading.  I presented<br/>\nopportunities (real life and interest related) but if<br/>\nshe balked I backed off.  When she&#39;s ready for<br/>\nsomething she lets me know and it takes it so much<br/>\nfarther when we have that.  But the opportunities are<br/>\nalways offered or available.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, unschooling is everyday, summer and weekends<br/>\nthe learning continues, be it reading, or whatever. <br/>\nUnschoolers see learning in everything and everywhere.<br/>\n If when the summer roles around and you start<br/>\n&quot;school&quot; and say you need to read, BUT you can choose<br/>\nthe material, that isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s interest<br/>\nled and relaxed but not unschooling.  No one is<br/>\nbegrudging you or anything like that, it you guys are<br/>\nhappy great... :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still learning unschooling too and it has taken me<br/>\nawhile to let go of control and trust my children. <br/>\nBut we absolutely love this lifestyle and we&#39;re so<br/>\nmuch happier as a family.  My husband allows me to<br/>\nunschool the children, at first he was not happy but<br/>\nnow he is starting to ease off and trust<br/>\nme...afterall, I&#39;m the one who has studied<br/>\nphilosophies for over 3 years.LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca, whatever you are doing is great!  But you<br/>\nwanted to know whether or not you were truly<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot;, just trying to help you understand the<br/>\nphilosophy behind it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I explained it to you was pretty much the way<br/>\nthat Ren explained it to me.  At first, I was a little<br/>\ntaken back, now, I&#39;ve been moving forward and with the<br/>\nwonderful support from these women, we&#39;re moving along<br/>\nfine, even though being a newby, I&#39;ll have my insanity<br/>\nmoments and need support.  ;-)<br/>\n <br/>\n Rebecca<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Happy Learning,<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\nwww.360.yahoo.com/aplan4life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s sort of narrowing the activity or the learning to think in those terms too much. There&#39;s so much overlap in learning because everthing&#39;s connected. It&#39;s a web. Science has it&#39;s place inhistory which relates to social customs of the day which is found in its literature and art, etc. That&#39;s why it&#39;s freeing to see beyond subjects.

If someone else was there to stay with them I would. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was just me and the kids, I wouldn&#39;t ask them each time we were going out. At that age my kids usually liked running errands with me so I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to plant the idea that it wasn&#39;t going to be fun. BUT...if one of them came to me and said they were in the middle of something and really didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d evaluate the importance of the errand at that moment. I&#39;d see what was stopping them from going. I&#39;d see if I could make the errand more appealing in some way. I tried not to just lay down the law because I had an errand.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were lots of things I saved to do until their dad was home. When I really thought about it, most things weren&#39;t critical to do at  a certain time. I guess doctors appointments, that kind of thing. But since my kids knew I wasn&#39;t always insisting they go out when they had other plans for themselves, they were good about accomodating me when I needed it. I also gave lots of warning about things like errands.
