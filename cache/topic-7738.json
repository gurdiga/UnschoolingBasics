Everyone who  works there (&#39;cept me), it seems, shows or trains dogs (well, two gals  raise/train show horses) and has been in the business since  childhood.   It gets expensive to raise, train and show the  dogs, so free helpers are always welcome.   There are also  competitions just for kids who own dogs, and sometimes trainers need  home placement for retired dogs, giving families an opportunity to take  in a healthy, well-bred, well-behaved pet. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  For me, it&#39;s just a weekend job (I prefer rescue mutts) but for the  other folks there, it&#39;s a big part of their lives, and their kids&#39;  lives and their parents&#39; lives before them...<br/>\n  <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
