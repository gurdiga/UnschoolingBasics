Karl didn&#39;t read anything until about 10, then he<br/>\nread game manuals, game text and such as needed and now at 14 he just<br/>\nstarted reading books.  He was not remotely interested in reading untill he<br/>\ndiscovered Pokemon and the many guide books.  But his memorization skills<br/>\nwere and are astounding. He has had big parts in plays before he coule read,<br/>\nhe knew the stats of each and every pokemon he owned and what they could<br/>\nbecome and why, their strengths and weaknesses and how they intereacted with<br/>\neach other. Something interesting we discovered a few years ago. I think<br/>\nKarl was 10 or 11. Not reading much yet. I came to unschooling rather slowly<br/>\nand was hesitant about all the time he spent with Pokeomon. A good friend<br/>\nwho has his Phd in reading assessment or some such thing (and oddly enough,<br/>\nhas always been very supportive of homeschooling and unschooling).  Anywya,<br/>\nhe took a job where he needed to give all these assessment tests. Many for<br/>\n&#39;learning disabilities&#39; and closed head injuries. He wanted to practice his<br/>\ntest-giving skills and asked if Karl was willing to be a guinea pig. Karl<br/>\nhas a good relationship with this guy, the tests are like games and he<br/>\nalways fed him wll so Karl was more than willing. I agreed as long as my<br/>\nfriend understood that the results meant nothing to me and we would stop any<br/>\ntime Karl wanted to. And Karl would probably skew any stats. Anyway, he went<br/>\nthrough the whole battery of tests. He actually took more than any one<br/>\n&#39;patient&#39; would normally take, but they were having fun my friend gave as<br/>\nmany as Karl was willing to take.  As I expected, he was above &#39;grade level&#39;<br/>\nin some areas, below in others....but what was astounding to my friend were<br/>\ntwo results. Karl, a non-reader, had a vocabulary score that was off the<br/>\nchart for college level. No big surprise to me, I knew he has been exposed<br/>\nto lots of good information all his life, reading does not guarentee a good<br/>\nvocabulary.   And another test that measured memory skills, both short term<br/>\nand long term. He again scored off the chart. When he described the test to<br/>\nme I laughed. I told him that compared to what Karl needed to know for<br/>\nPokemon, the test was a peice of cake!!  Mind you, I would have done poorly,<br/>\nI never was good at memory stuff, but for Karl, it was a breeze. Another<br/>\ntest he did well on was some kind of congnitive reasoning test. He could<br/>\nfigure things out well.  The tests that measured &quot;knowledge&quot; for his age he<br/>\nwas all over the spectrum.  Really low to a bit above average.  My friends<br/>\nfinal comment was, he might not know what society says he&#39;s &quot;supposed&quot; to<br/>\nknow, but it won&#39;t matter, when he needs to know something, he has the tools<br/>\nhe needs.  He still talks about the memory tests results.  Though it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nmy goal when I agreed to the testing, it sure helped ease some of my<br/>\nfears. I&#39;m not advocating testing either, for the most part, I think a lots<br/>\nof tests are flawed, admininstered incorrectly or used incorrectly.  But<br/>\nKarl had a lot of fun and it was interesting to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-16, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html\">http://www.homeschoolingonashoestring.com/REACH_home.html</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/7/06, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The cool things about Jared, who learned to read at 12:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~when we were driving around town, he didn&#39;t read the signs, he saw<br/>\n&gt; interesting patterns, or clouds, or colors...saw the world totally<br/>\n&gt; different than a reader (once you can read, you can&#39;t NOT read...try<br/>\n&gt; looking at a sign and not reading it!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~he saw symbols and patterns everywhere...he could memorize literally<br/>\n&gt; hundreds of symbols from games.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~his memorization skills were amazing, he knew every single Yu-gi-oh<br/>\n&gt; card in his deck based on the picture.
