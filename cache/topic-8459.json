When do the kids learn accurate punctuation, spelling, etc.? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They learn by doing when the times comes. Right now my 11 yod Casey is spending most of her time on Neopets. Some people might say she&#39;s just playing. They might even moan that she does nothing all day but chat on the computer. But I can see the learning. I can see the excitement of her pursuing something she loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday she was creating an &quot;application&quot; to adopt a pet. She wrote a full page of HTML coding to create her application page, a story describing the life of her desired pet, a poem and a description of herself and her Neopets family. It was an amazing amount of work. She asked me to proofread her story. I was surprised (but not really) at how her spelling and grammar is improving each time I do this for her. She&#39;s writing because she has a goal. She wants to adopt that pet. She wants it accurate because apparently the person giving up the pet for adoption said spelling and grammar count. :o) When Casey first started writing stories, she didn&#39;t stress over spelling and grammar and neither did I. Now she cares and her writing has naturally improved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been noticing the amount of math concepts she getting on Neopets. She created a store to sell her unused items. She&#39;s keeping a log of what she&#39;s got, how much she spent on it and how much she needs to clear to make a profit. She&#39;s learned that she can undersell some items and overprice others to end up with a net profit. She&#39;s also becoming incredibly proficient in flipping around and understanding numbers in the thousands and millions. That&#39;s something we had talked about and played around with before but that was always confusing for her. Now she talks about having 10k and selling something for 30k and now she has 40,000 neopoints. Add that to her current bank account of 970k and she&#39;ll tel me she&#39;s got over a million points. She *understands* those numbers and what they really represent because it has meaning for her in her shop and it helps her to accomplish whatever Neopets goals she has currently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are just a couple of examples using my daughter as an example. My son&#39;s story is completely different. He&#39;s not interested in writing or Neopets. But he loves Halo2 and XBox. He loves gaming, manga, Anime and anything Japanese. Things like writing and math concepts flow out of those interests. His learning is following that path and his own timetable. He frequents websites and message boards to discuss these passions. He uses spelling and grammar to be understood and appreciated. He&#39;s been using his math skils forever (it seems) to buy and sell all of his fan-based items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Getting rid of TV is not an option right now, but I need to become more<br/>\n </span></blockquote>disciplined in how much we watch.  Help with ideas???&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. I would suggest you not worry so much. Easier said than done I know. But TV is not the enemy. In fact it can be a great unschooling ally if you learn to see it for the value it can bring to your child&#39;s otherwise interesting and full life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first trick is to get in there and watch TV and play the PS2 with your kids. Figure out what they&#39;re getting from these games and programs and support that. TV has brought so much learning into our lives and has led to much, much more. There are times they binge and seem to watch a lot and times they expand and explore into other activities. It&#39;s kind of all connected. But by not demonizing the TV or XBox in our house, it&#39;s viewed as just another activity. Since you only got a TV a year ago and have been struggling with a homeschool schedule, TV is still new and inviting. I&#39;d let them fill their need until they&#39;re ready to branch out to other things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;We do have a support group we belong to, but none of them &#39;unschool&#39;.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Online support and friends can be incredibly helpful.

I&#39;m still in deschooling mode with my 11 yo dd and I <br/>\nunderstand your concerns.  Take each day one day at a time, he will <br/>\nbegin to direct his own interest.  Watching TV and playing PS2 is good <br/>\nfor your son right now, he needs to deschool and take control of his <br/>\nenvironment.  You need to deschool too and read as many books as you <br/>\ncan on unschooling.  There is a book list in the files column.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my friends are homeschoolers too and I said one thing to my <br/>\nclosest friend and that caused such a back lash that I know longer say <br/>\nanything to that group of friends.
