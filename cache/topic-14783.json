They get that-I think they even get the why of it all. But the<br/>\nlittle one walks more slowly than anyone on Earth &lt;g&gt;! Usual response is<br/>\ndragging, nagging. Yesterday, I took a mental step back because I knew I<br/>\ncould not just walk off and leave him to fend for himself in a parking lot<br/>\nif he didn&#39;t want to hold hands or keep up with the rest of us. I realized<br/>\nit was my job to keep him safe and rather than insist that he stay with us,<br/>\nI could just slow down and keep pace with him. Duh!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would do this for an 18 month old, but it hadn&#39;t occurred to me that the<br/>\nmost peaceful path here with a 6 year old would be the same. Voices in back<br/>\nof head: &quot;He should know by now!&quot; &quot;Does he want to get hit by a car?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Doesn&#39;t he realize how dangerous it is to drift off into la-la land in the<br/>\nmiddle of the street?&quot; I don&#39;t even have to pay &#39;m any mind. Just do the<br/>\nnext right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been just a matter of looking at what is really important here, what<br/>\nis going on underneath this? A practice I have always done (many normal<br/>\nthings like sleeping in our own beds and bedtimes and naptimes and even<br/>\nmealtimes don&#39;t make sense to me!) but I just get to carry it a little<br/>\nfurther now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the pupil is ready, the teacher appears!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Alice Madaris<br/>\n<br/>\nMother and Facilitator to Elijah and Noah<br/>\n<br/>\nWife and partner to Mike<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14800,"nextTopicId":14814}}
