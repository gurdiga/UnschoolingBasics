I started <br/>\ncalling them &quot;na-na&quot; because it was one of the only sounds he could <br/>\nprounouce around 2y.o. It stuck.<br/>\nHe was really good with hand motions, telling us entire stories <br/>\nwithout words until he was 3y.o. But sometimes the frustration level <br/>\nwould get high very quickly, so it was nice for him to have a word <br/>\nfor nursing that everyone understood...or that we could ask him and <br/>\nget an affirmation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s four now, and still loves his &quot;na-na&#39;s&quot; every night (sometimes <br/>\nin the wee hours of the morning too) and when he wakes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I dream of my body being my own again...but when we&#39;re <br/>\nsnuggled under the covers and that sweet little head is right under <br/>\nmy nose, there is nothing better in all the world.<br/>\nI know how fast he&#39;ll be a teen, so I&#39;m just treasuring my last <br/>\nlittle toddler. sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4970,"nextTopicId":4977}}
