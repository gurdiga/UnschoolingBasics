At times, they will stop playing a game<br/>\nlike that and ask me if I want to play another that doesn&#39;t make me sick. So<br/>\nI can connect that way as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39999,"nextTopicId":40049}}
