You have obviously found it to be<br/>\nsuccessful and they seem very happy and healthy.&quot;<br/>\nHere is my response<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all part of our parenting philosophy really and really about how<br/>\nwe see life.  We wanted to take more control of our lives and therefor<br/>\nthat meant giving the boys more control of their own lives and trusting<br/>\nthem to know what was right for them.  We call our way the unschooling<br/>\nway, as it means that Martin and I have had to unlearn so much from or<br/>\nown upbringing and schooling.  The parenting has been a doddle it has<br/>\nbeen our journey that has been hard.  It brings up fears and doubts and<br/>\npain and suffering that we are dealing with and growing as we go.  We<br/>\nare not perfect and stumble at times but our boys see the real us warts<br/>\nand all.  The most important things are honesty and communication and<br/>\nbeing there for the boys to enable them to explore the world in all its<br/>\ndimensions at a time that is right for them and in a way that they<br/>\nenjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe then said<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always believed that my children can do what they want as long as<br/>\n they are happy and don&#39;t hurt anyone else. But what would have scared<br/>\nme about not send I g them to conventional schools is the fear that they<br/>\n would then not be able to be happy alongside a world that often defines<br/>\n success as being able to fit in with or to know certain rules. I<br/>\nemphatically believe that we shouldn&#39;t always follow the norm if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t suit us or make us happy but it can be useful to know what the<br/>\nnorm is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI responded<br/>\n<br/>\nOur boys spend their days with so many different ages and ranges of<br/>\nhumanity, they are self-disciplined and if they need to be somewhere at a<br/>\n set time I do not have to remind them, they fit in to any social<br/>\nsituation and other people of all ages have commented on how enjoyable<br/>\ntheir company is. They are considered very well-mannered and helpful and<br/>\n go to activities with adults who are amazed at how at ease they are.<br/>\nThey have friends who come over to spend time with us all ranging from 8<br/>\n to 60 and all feel very relaxed in their company.

When has it ever been otherwise?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Western world has long been divided between adults and children, with children expected to watch and listen until they&#39;re &quot;old enough&quot; to offer &quot;worthwhile&quot; opinions. It&#39;s not a good atmosphere for learning to talk to adults in. (If some kids are comfortable speaking to adults, it&#39;s because of their personality and because they are born with interpersonal intelligence. (See the points about Gardner below.) And because a few kids get to grow up with parents who treat them with respect.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter and I would walk down to the center of our town, adults would say hi, but kids wouldn&#39;t. Often the adults would only say hi to me. My daughter commented on it and found it interesting. Kids are kept disconnected from the adult world by power and seeing them as less than. It&#39;s not unlike when blacks were considered non-people by whites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s highly unusual when schools kids feel comfortable talking to adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not so unusual for unschooled kids to see everyone as people because unschooled kids are treated with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and, you know what? Some of these aunts, grandparents<br/>\n&gt; know a thing or two about life regardless if they agree<br/>\n&gt; with him being home schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This suggests a lot of frustration with him. You have a &quot;right&quot; idea of how he should view the world and his view is disappointing you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis 15. He&#39;s been locked in an institution where he&#39;s been treated like his ideas aren&#39;t worthy of being paid attention to unless they match adult ideas. By late teens people are biologically wired to begin pulling away, preparing to be on their own. Being *still* told they need to shut up and pay attention to people who have better ideas will irritate their biology. If they&#39;re treated that way they&#39;ll reject what adults say -- good or bad -- just because they want to finally have a chance to explore their own ideas. That&#39;s why schooled teens are so surly.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who&#39;ve been respected all along don&#39;t go through that awkward transition. They&#39;ve known all along that anyone&#39;s ideas can be good regardless of age but that adults have a lot of good ideas that come from experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can make the transition to adulthood easier for him or harsher for him. You get to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Besides, my son has some very grandiose ideas about what he can do,<br/>\n&gt; but very unrealistic expectations in most cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>A big part of learning is exploring what someone believes might work. From that they grow an understanding of what works, what doesn&#39;t work and why. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing 15 means having grandiose ideas. Support him in exploring bits of them in safe and doable ways. If you ask here people may have some ideas. But his ideas will become more thoughtful the more he sees you as a helpful resource rather than another power figure who is critical of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not an adult yet. Don&#39;t expect him to be an adult. Expect him to be and support him in being 15. When kids first start walking they like to hold onto a finger. You&#39;re withholding the finger he needs to &quot;toddle&quot; expecting that lack of help will make him realize he needs to just get up and walk properly on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He thinks I should just &quot;give him a diploma&quot; so he can get on with his life.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does he need a diploma?<br/>\n<br/>\nA diploma means something when a school is accredited. The accreditation means the school is meeting well defined standards that an employer or college can check on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one&#39;s accrediting home schools. Even if you set standards for when you decide he&#39;s done, your diploma doesn&#39;t mean anything to anyone who would hire him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn applications, there&#39;s generally a box for highest level of education. Homeschoolers fill in &quot;home schooled&quot;. If they&#39;ve taken a community college course, they can check off &quot;Some college.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat life does he want to get on with? And why does he see you as a road block? Why doesn&#39;t he see you as a resource to help him explore what he&#39;s interested in? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Um, sorry, no, you haven&#39;t cracked open a single book (not even for pleasure).<br/>\n&gt; He thinks because he &quot;works hard&quot; at cleaning the house, etc. he deserves it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not everyone learns best through books. In fact most people probably don&#39;t and why they find school so boring or hard. It&#39;s likely that your son did poorly in school because reading isn&#39;t his primary way of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks are *convenient* for schools. Books are good for certain kinds of learning. Schools have elevated reading because other ways of learning are impractical for them to manage with one teacher and 30 kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nA chef, musician, horse trainer, rocket scientist can become great at those without ever cracking a book. But they&#39;d be really lousy at those if they only learned from books.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese two pages might help you shift your thinking about what learning looks like and what to support:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/talk</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products\">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/products</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt will also help to understand Gardner&#39;s theory of multiple intelligences:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences/\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to know your son&#39;s intelligence type. It&#39;s good to have many avenues available swirling through his life and then support him in exploring what appeals to him in the way it appeals to him. You don&#39;t need to limit him to books any more. He&#39;s not in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At this point, he&#39;s still very much transitioning from being at school and<br/>\n&gt; really hasn&#39;t done anything I could, even using a very broad brush, paint as learning at this point. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Usually parents need the most deschooling since they were in school a lot longer than kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do want to create an unschooling home for him, it will help to broaden your brush and look more to supporting him in exploring and expanding his world and let go of criticizing him for what he needed to learn to survive in school. He is who he is because you sent him to school for 10 years. Create a supportive nest for him to heal in and he&#39;ll recover a lot faster than if you&#39;re watching and judging and criticizing him as not up to your standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"jo kirby","from":"jo kirby &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: grandparents don&#39;t understand unschooling","postDate":"1374082656","msgId":49878,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzQwODI2NTYuMzMzMi5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTcxMzA1Lm1haWwuaXIyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFFQUY1NkQ3RUVCNTRCRDk5QkI2Njg0QTU1NDFBNDE0QEtpbU9mZmljZT4=","referencesHeader":"PGtzM3JycituY3Q1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUVBRjU2RDdFRUI1NEJEOTlCQjY2ODRBNTU0MUE0MTRAS2ltT2ZmaWNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":49877,"nextInTopic":49879,"prevInTime":49877,"nextInTime":49879,"topicId":49858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At this point, he s still very much transitioning from being at school and really hasn t done anything I could, even using a very broad brush, paint as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1768270283\">&quot;At this point, he&#39;s still very much transitioning from being at school and really hasn&#39;t done anything I could, even using a very broad brush, paint as learning&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to paint anything, but he can&#39;t not be learning.

You&#39;re still stuck with a very &quot;schooled&quot; view of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven schooled kids deschool! Employers of young adults note that it takes up to two years for kids to stop thinking and acting like they&#39;re at school and adjust to the workplace. Some colleges now recommend kids take a year or two off before college for the same reason. For a late teen, burnt out on school, the best thing you can do is back off and let him rest and recover, goof off, heal, and start to figure out who he really is and what&#39;s important to him (or her!). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Besides, my son has some very grandiose ideas about what he can do, but very unrealistic expectations in most cases.

What sorts of things does he want to do? Maybe people here can help you see the other options that exist beyond school style learning... which isn&#39;t a terribly effective way to learn at the best of times. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your guy has been chilling out, staying away from education and doing other things, he&#39;s been deschooling in ways that most experienced unschoolers recommend on a regular basis.

Homeschoolers (including unschoolers) do not need a diploma - or if they do, it can be a parent-issued diploma, based on whatever criteria you choose. Millions of homeschoolers, including hundreds (or thousands) of unschoolers have gotten into college (or vocational schools) without having an accredited diploma - most without having a parent-issued diploma, since that is generally not necessary.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son got into college on the basis of SAT scores. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter chose to get a GED, which is equivalent to a high school diploma. But that was because she didn&#39;t think she could get the score she would have needed on the SAT or ACT, in math. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to make transcripts for my kids. They each attend a &quot;community college&quot;, but here in GA, not everyone can get accepted quite as easily as they can in states like AZ, CA, NM, CT, TX, etc. They needed parent-made transcripts, and the GA state college system requires homeschoolers to either get an above-average score on the SAT or ACT, OR to get a GED.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I&#39;ve read, most colleges these days have a process in place for homeschooled students to apply, and they do want to see a parent-made transcript. Most colleges also want to see SAT or ACT scores as well, but I have read, repeatedly, for many years now, that *community colleges* in *most* states will accept applicants without any test scores at all. Those community colleges require applicants to take placement tests, and if they score too low for college level work, the students must take remedial courses first, which cost the same as college courses, but do not give college credit. Many unschoolers have started community colleges while in their teens - or even as young as 12, in some cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, who is dyslexic but loves to read (she started to enjoy reading when she was 14) and is an excellent writer, has always had a very hard time with math. If she were to get the requisite psychological testing for a diagnosis, I have no doubt that she would be diagnosed with dyscalculia - and with a diagnosis, she could get certain accommodations in college. But, so far, she has not wanted to go through the hassle and expense of the testing. (We could never afford it when she was younger; she could afford it herself, at this point, so that option is open to her.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have not looked into the GED option, that might be something your son will want to consider eventually. If he decides he wants to go to a vocational school or technical college, it may make getting in more hassle-free. It can also help in getting some financial aid. The GED tests allow the students as much time as they need on each test; each of the 5 tests can be taken on a different day; and the community and tech colleges and vocational schools are not interested in the test scores - all the GED students need is to have passed. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, who had avoided formal math learning like the plague until she was 18, took a one-semester online high school level math course (a general &quot;math concepts&quot; course) when she decided that she was going to get the GED, and she studied on her own (and with me) from a GED test-prep book and various websites. She just barely passed the GED math test - but that was all she needed to do. She scored very high on the other 4 tests. She had taken several online high school courses, starting at the age of 16, including biology - which included some basic chemistry. She never took any formal history courses, and I think she only took one semester of high school English (lit/comp), so she mostly learned what she knows of those subjects informally. (She took 2 years of Japanese online, so she had the 2 years of foreign language that GA state colleges require. But she didn&#39;t study Japanese for the requirement - she just wanted to learn it because of her interest in Japanese anime cartoons and Manga books.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son has learning disabilities, but wants to go to college anyway, I&#39;m sure that having a formal diagnosis will lead to him being eligible for disabilities accommodations, which may make the difference between his being able to get into and through college, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son shows any interest at all in attending college, I recommend that you look on the website of the community college and technical college nearest where you live, and see what they require from homeschooled applicants.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have to make a transcript, keep in mind that you have the authority, as the &quot;director&quot; of your &quot;homeschool program&quot; to establish your own criteria for courses that you list. Information learned need not have been learned through a textbook or specific online course or in-person class, nor over the period of one school year. There are *many* branches/categories of science and history. All reading (and listening to audio books) can be counted as literature. I even considered attending plays as a part of my daughter&#39;s literature education. We attended a lot of plays!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of examples of homeschool transcripts on the internet.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":452754049,"authorName":"melissa maranda","from":"melissa maranda &lt;love.gratitude@...&gt;","profile":"marandamelissa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] co-sleeping, WAS grandparents don&#39;t understand unschooling","postDate":"1373952232","msgId":49870,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE3OC1XNDM1QTY5RTI3Q0QwOTIzNUJDNDUzOEY0NjAwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtydjJjbitiOWxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtydDdwais0Mmt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiw8a3J2MmNuK2I5bGFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49869,"nextInTopic":49871,"prevInTime":49869,"nextInTime":49871,"topicId":49858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dd will be 9 this month and still co-sleeps.

Those are things you could accommodate without clearing out a whole room. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 4 and 6, they&#39;ll probably want to share the family bed for a few years longer, as long as it&#39;s comfortable for everyone, so the only real issue to consider is if you think someone would call child services on you... and then you Have a kid-bedroom.

We set up a room for my daughter in my closet when she was... six or seven I think, because her sleep needs were really different than mine. She&#39;d sleep part of the night in her bed and part in the family bed, and did that until she was... too big for the little bed in the closet. Then we converted another very small room - barely bigger than the closet but big enough for a real mattress - into a bedroom for her. She still slept some of the night in the family bed, and sometimes all night if she needed to until she was... ten I think. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I know families where the kids are in the family bed until the early teens, and still come back to the family bed at times for extra cuddling. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: grandparents don&#39;t understand unschooling","postDate":"1373938246","msgId":49865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtzMjdvNitjODhuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3OTkzRUQyRUQxNzQ4NENBMThBRjk5QzIwQjIxQTJDQEtpbU9mZmljZT4="},"prevInTopic":49864,"nextInTopic":49866,"prevInTime":49864,"nextInTime":49866,"topicId":49858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Troy & Kim Dake  wrote: How did you provide a diploma/certificate of completion and transcripts to the college for an unschooled child (or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-514369684\">&quot;Troy & Kim Dake&quot; &lt;flannel4us@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n How did you provide a &quot;diploma/certificate of completion&quot; and transcripts to the college for an unschooled child (or did you even HAVE to)?<br/>\n****************<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of different options for getting into college:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teen/college\">http://sandradodd.com/teen/college</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160565158,"authorName":"Troy & Kim Dake","from":"&quot;Troy & Kim Dake&quot; &lt;flannel4us@...&gt;","profile":"kimadopts2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: grandparents don&#39;t understand unschooling","postDate":"1373904488","msgId":49864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3OTkzRUQyRUQxNzQ4NENBMThBRjk5QzIwQjIxQTJDQEtpbU9mZmljZT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtydDdwais0Mmt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtydDdwais0Mmt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49863,"nextInTopic":49865,"prevInTime":49863,"nextInTime":49865,"topicId":49858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Linda, I have a very basic question for you about your kids being in college after unschooling.

The hurt is still there, but it&#39;s less like an open wound when you have less contact.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom knew we homeschooled, but I never mentioned unschooling to her. She would have been horrified by the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my kids are in college and have jobs, and my son is, in fact, supporting himself and living as an independent adult, there&#39;s no point in talking to my mom about unschooling - even though she would now view my kids as academically and socially &quot;successful&quot;. But I do hope that our experience will add to the already large collection of anecdotal evidence that unschooling leads to happy, confident, enthusiastic, interesting kids who grow to be happy, confident, enthusiastic, interesting, and self-reliant adults! So if you ever do decide to try to convince your father by examples, my family is one such example.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, maybe it&#39;ll help you to know that you&#39;re not alone in feeling hurt by a parent who doesn&#39;t seem to love and accept you. My kids know that I love and accept them unconditionally, and that has, over time, helped to comfort my inner child. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":482616263,"authorName":"judyw0607","from":"&quot;judyw0607&quot; &lt;judyw0607@...&gt;","profile":"judyw0607","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: grandparents don&#39;t understand unschooling","postDate":"1373762647","msgId":49862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtyc3M4bis5MmlwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtycGRkaCtlNnRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49861,"nextInTopic":49863,"prevInTime":49861,"nextInTime":49863,"topicId":49858,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would recommend simply not responding to the email.

My sister (who&#39;s been a public elementary school teacher for 20-ish years) went on and on about what he&#39;d need to know by the end of kindergarten  (writing 20-word sentences still sticks in my memory!), and it really irritated me...for quite a while, in fact.  I&#39;m glad I chose not to respond at all.  Ordinarily, that wouldn&#39;t have been my style, but it has made for calmer interactions when we&#39;re together at family events.

It is about your father&#39;s thoughts about you and your family.  And his apparent desire to share them with you and influence you.  If you are open to receiving and considering his input, do with it what you will.  If you are not, if this is the same old same old to you....just delete it.  He is uncomfortable and concerned for your family and trying to deal with it in the way he knows how- to criticize you and offer advice.  He also sees your normal everyday stress and thinks he has the answers.  If his answers don&#39;t resonate for you, they&#39;re not the right solutions for you.  It doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s willing to deal with his discomfort by understanding you and your family, therefore explanation isn&#39;t likely to go anywhere.  In fact it&#39;s likely to increase his discomfort and result in more criticism and advice- unless he&#39;s made a shift into truly wanting to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me I&#39;d probably think &quot;yep, that&#39;s just dad being dad&quot; and move on.

I usually just ignore them, but still I&#39;m hurt even after so many years of trying to heal my childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that you and [my husband] are probably subscribing to the Vicki Robin &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; ideal of living simply and not let money control your life. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust bear in mind that Vicki Robin is different from you in two important ways, she has no children and she earns royalty from her popular book and speaking engagements.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she practices may not be practical for most people.  Money does not buy happiness, only security and more choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso consider that spending 24/7 with your kid for the first 18 years of their lives takes a big chunk of your life.  I can see it get on your nerves sometimes.  [The younger one] is almost 3, sure you want another 15 years of this?  That is why there are pre-school and regular schools to get them out of the house for a few hours so the parents can unwind.  You and [hubby] were certainly not harmed by that.  The kids can also benefit from socializing with other kids their age and not 24/7 with parents much older than them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether your efforts will bear real fruit is questionable.  Judging from the experience of So and So [my aunt and uncle who practiced attached parenting], [their older child] did not turn out to be less conventional than most young people her age and she doesn&#39;t quite love her parents as much as you would expect from all that efforts. [Their younger child] actually turn out to be more level headed and closer to them without all that efforts.  I like [younger child] more than [The older one].  Genetics often have more influence than parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a family of 4, one of you have to work or be self employed to generate sufficiently income to provide for the kids well-being and education. I think they need a better apartment and not sleep on the floor with vents that open down to the basement.  Love can only go so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n[He is referring to our mattresses on the floor, as we have a family bed. The apartment is not that great.
