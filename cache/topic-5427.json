He believes that those diagnosed with dyslexia <br/>\nare really good at &quot;flipping things in their heads&quot; to see all sides of <br/>\nit (like the example of moving the pen around, but this would be the <br/>\ntalent of &quot;looking at all sides of the pen&quot; when presented with a <br/>\nstationary pen). He says that he learned to do this as a toddler when <br/>\nstressed--in most instances it helped him cope (gave him more accurate <br/>\ninformation and mastery of his world). But when he went to read the <br/>\nstress of &quot;not knowing&quot; what the letter was engaged this otherwise <br/>\nhelpful response and made the letter spin/reorient. (He seems remarkably <br/>\naware of his own processes and responses.) This made it more difficult <br/>\nto understand what the letter was, which led to more stress, which led <br/>\nto more reorientations, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis book has suggestions for helping those with this talent to anchor <br/>\nthe visual reorientations at will. Slowing down and relaxing is a major <br/>\nhelp, I think! I feel like I could have been diagnosed as at least <br/>\nslightly dyslexic, but I developed my own coping mechanisms.

My teacher-friend, Gillian, freaks out that <br/>\nDunc still writes all his numbers backwards. Occasionally he writes <br/>\nbackwards too---mirror image letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I haven&#39;t worried at all. He reads a LOT---but writes less <br/>\nfrequently. Seems to write everything backwards or everything <br/>\nforwards---as if there&#39;s a switch he flips to write correctly or not. <br/>\nHe *used* to write everything backwards; now it&#39;s every other time or <br/>\nso. It&#39;s weird. I asked him the other day about his numbers. He asked <br/>\nwhy it mattered. &lt;g&gt; Everyone seems to be able to figure it out. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since we haven&#39;t worried about his reading ---and more importantly, <br/>\nwe haven&#39;t worried *in front of him* about it, he&#39;s clueless that it&#39;s <br/>\na problem, so it&#39;s not.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 12 now. He reads really well. My guess is that at 16 you won&#39;t be <br/>\nable to tell he ever struggled at all. And he never *has* <br/>\nstruggled---but if he had been in school, he *may* have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many &quot;tricks&quot; you can use to help a child with reading, <br/>\nincluding &quot;pink&quot; glasses  or pink &quot;film&quot; over the words as well a <br/>\nbookmark with a hole cut out to focus on one word at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unless the *child* wants help, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. Just make <br/>\na print-rich environment and read to/for him a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I&#39;m in the minority about this.

We are currently doing our testing for <br/>\nthis year and my son can not read but he CAN answer the question, <br/>\npick the work, then find the work through sounding it out (all of <br/>\nthis is done with me reading the question, then the answers, then he <br/>\npicks the word he choose)- To realize that these symbols make sounds <br/>\nis huge!

I<br/>\nhave a husband and a daughter with dyslexia.  My husband learned to read in<br/>\nspite of it...he loves to read...his approach is just different than mine<br/>\nand a bit slower. He was never &#39;diagnosed&#39; as a child, he just had &#39;reading<br/>\nproblems&#39;. My daughter struggled with reading....had I moved to unschooling<br/>\nsooner I would have not pushed her nearly as much.  She learned to read when<br/>\nshe was ready...it did take her longer. My daughter also has short-term<br/>\nmemory issues for a long time.  Her brain just didn&#39;t get all the processing<br/>\ndown for a while.  From the many families I hear from...all the special<br/>\nclasses and techniques in the world don&#39;t make it happen any sooner. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t undo dyslexia, it isn&#39;t a disability or a bad thing...it&#39;s just a<br/>\ndifferent way of looking at the printed word.  I think it needs to be<br/>\ncompensated for, it needs to be acknowledged that they see and approach<br/>\nreading differently....but given time and given no stress and labels...those<br/>\nwith dyslexia can will learn to read just fine.  We have always done a lot<br/>\nof reading aloud and books on tape. Oddly enough, she has always and to this<br/>\nday, preferred non-fiction to fiction.
