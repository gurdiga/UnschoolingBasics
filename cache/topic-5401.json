You say that your children love unschooling <br/>\n(mine too ;), but that it&#39;s *you* who sometimes feels guilty.  Is the <br/>\nguilt about not making your kids &quot;suffer through school&quot; like you had <br/>\nto (like your relative had to)?  That somehow they&#39;re being &quot;let off <br/>\nthe hook&quot; and just seem to be enjoying themselves too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat hook is no place you wanna be.  You might have read them already, <br/>\nbut I really really find two links especially helpful to new (or <br/>\nreturning) unschooling parents who are on the fence or in need of <br/>\nridding themselves of doubts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling for Parents<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://www.sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCertificate of Empowerment<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/empowerment\">http://www.sandradodd.com/empowerment</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI highly recommend that you read, read, read through the rest of <br/>\nSandra&#39;s site, too.
