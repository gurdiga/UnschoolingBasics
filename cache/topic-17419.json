Many people think it&#39;s perfectly safe to be out in the blazing sun for hours on end as long as they&#39;ve applied sunblock. That is also absolutely untrue.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ******<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We don&#39;t use sunblock often around here.  We all tan pretty easily, and tho I burn occasionally, the boys have darker skin, so it&#39;s less a concern for them.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing to consider while advocating that all people avoid all sun exposure is that the sun is a prime source of Vitamin D, which in several studies has been shown to reduce one&#39;s risk of colon cancer, and maybe some other cancers.  In kids, not getting enough vitamin D can lead to rickets -- recently on the rise in some parts of the US.  When you block out the sun&#39;s rays, you block out the opportunity for the body to produce sufficient amounts of Vit D.  Sure, they put it in many milks -- tho it won&#39;t be in many of the organic or natural milks and certainly not in raw milk.  Also, there&#39;s concern that synthetic Vit D in such sources as milk and vitamin drops isn&#39;t metabolized by the body in the same way and isn&#39;t as effective as plain, old sunlight.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap.
