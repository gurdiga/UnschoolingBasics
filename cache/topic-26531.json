And that&#39;s important<br/>\n&gt; to realize. They weren&#39;t designed to provide the best education for<br/>\n&gt; each student. They were designed 100 years ago to cheaply raise the<br/>\n&gt; general education level of the masses. Teachers and parents and<br/>\n&gt; educators 100 years later *want* schools to be more, want schools to<br/>\n&gt; provide what every child needs. But 1) real learning would be too<br/>\n&gt; expensive and 2) they don&#39;t trust learning that doesn&#39;t look like<br/>\n&gt; school learning because: they&#39;re trapped by never having experienced<br/>\n&gt; real learning on the level that unschoolers do, needing to prove<br/>\n&gt; learning is taking place (to parents and the state) so need a process<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s testable, needing something that&#39;s &quot;cheap&quot; (for example 30<br/>\n&gt; kids and only one adult, one set of information for every child.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The fact is that learning the way schools teach is really hard. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; why it takes 12 years!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If kids were taught how to build with Legos the way schools teach<br/>\n&gt; everything, they&#39;d first -- before kids had ever seen a Lego or even<br/>\n&gt; had the desire to build with them -- be made to memorize all the<br/>\n&gt; colors Legos come in, then the shapes, then ways Legos could be<br/>\n&gt; connected, then systematically go through architectural styles (since<br/>\n&gt; that would be practical knowledge that could be useful for future<br/>\n&gt; careers), engineering principles. Then the kids would be given plans<br/>\n&gt; and told to put the Legos together exactly according to the<br/>\n&gt; instructions. (Points off for any bricks out of place.) And then the<br/>\n&gt; kids who were truly gifted in sucking up this information would be<br/>\n&gt; allowed free access to Legos.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When your child was first acquiring language, did you worry that<br/>\n&gt; because he wanted to talk about balls and dinosaurs and favorite t-<br/>\n&gt; shirts that he would never be able to discuss how nuclear fission<br/>\n&gt; differs from other forms of radioactive decay?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Think about the non-academic interests he can speak knowledgeably<br/>\n&gt; about and how he acquired that knowledge. Did it come from building<br/>\n&gt; an abstract foundation of knowledge before beginning to tackle what<br/>\n&gt; he was interested in? Or did it come bit by bit picking up more<br/>\n&gt; information as he used what little information he had? Basically<br/>\n&gt; doing something before he understood it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s how unschooling works. Kids build up knowledge about what<br/>\n&gt; interests them. They have a vested interest in understanding what<br/>\n&gt; interests them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; (Unfortunately for new unschooling moms, what interests them usually<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t look academic. It looks a lot like playing. (Play is how kids<br/>\n&gt; are created to learn!) Learning looks like video games and Harry<br/>\n&gt; Potter and making videos and reading and watching TV and playing with<br/>\n&gt; friends and pretend and chatting on line.) It&#39;s really only after<br/>\n&gt; kids are grown and following their interests into college and jobs<br/>\n&gt; that we can see how what they did led to where they got. But the<br/>\n&gt; ongoing process doesn&#39;t look at all like school.)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kids don&#39;t learn to ride bikes by studying the physics of rotation.<br/>\n&gt; They learn by getting on and falling until they build up enough<br/>\n&gt; understanding to keep it upright. Even once they have it upright,<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t know everything. They know just enough to do what they<br/>\n&gt; want to do. As they want to do more, the acquire more information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s exactly how real learning works. Math -- real understanding of<br/>\n&gt; how numbers work -- comes from using numbers for personally<br/>\n&gt; meaningful uses. Games. Video games. Allowance. Art software.<br/>\n&gt; Decisions in the store. It takes *way way* fewer hours using math to<br/>\n&gt; understand it than in school. Schools present the abstract (which is<br/>\n&gt; testable) as a way to get kids to understand the underlying concepts<br/>\n&gt; (which is really hard to test). (And schools often fail, ending up<br/>\n&gt; with more people with math phobia than proficiency. And though<br/>\n&gt; schools take credit for the proficiency, they&#39;re no more responsible<br/>\n&gt; for math proficiency than art proficiency. Kids good at math are like<br/>\n&gt; kids good at art. But they *are* responsible for kids fearing math<br/>\n&gt; and hating art and history and science and reading.) The way schools<br/>\n&gt; teach everything is ass backwards and really hard which is why it<br/>\n&gt; takes so much work in schools.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a short cut from believing learning needs<br/>\n&gt; to look like school to believing that learning by doing is enough.<br/>\n&gt; And some people understand it&#39;s enough but still harbor feelings that<br/>\n&gt; it isn&#39;t enough.
