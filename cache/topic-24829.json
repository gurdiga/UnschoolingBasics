I hoped to hang on to some of my milk <br/>\nproduction until he was older and had better sucking power, but it&#39;s <br/>\ngone. He&#39;s not interested either, but I just feel that if I can get my <br/>\nmilk back, maybe he will start again. He&#39;s 9 months now (supposed to be <br/>\n6 months, was born at 26 wks gestation), and the time feel right to <br/>\npursue this. <br/>\nFYI, I breastfed my 1st son for 2+yrs(consistently), followed by <br/>\nintermittent breastfeeding until now. I hope this helps my case in <br/>\nretrieving my milk production. <br/>\nThanks for any feedback, I am up for trying most anything. <br/>\nLisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24836,"nextTopicId":24857}}
