Clover is in a smaller &quot;show bunny&quot; cage this <br/>\nweek in the kitchen. When the temperature gets over 90 degrees, I bring <br/>\nall the critters inside. I *could* put her in the garage, which is <br/>\ntolerable, but I feel better when she is more comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But an outside bunny is a possibility, NO? OH! And tell him: bunny <br/>\npoop is GREAT for the garden! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n From an unschooling perspective how can I respect my dh&#39;s<br/>\n preferences without giving up what my son and I<br/>\n would enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think that if one person is truly against it, that may be the way it <br/>\nneeds to be to keep peace.

He could scoop poop and clean runs and take <br/>\ncare of the dogs when the breeder is gone on show weekends. He could <br/>\nlearn how to care for and groom and whelp even! Or go to shows as the <br/>\ngopher.

I have always enjoyed going into <br/>\npet stores and when my son and I are in the vicinity of one we do so <br/>\ntogether. My husband is furious as he feels I am only encouraging my <br/>\nson and he feels &quot;set up&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son expresses to me but not his dad that he would like another <br/>\npet. He seems to enjoy other kids pets and yearns for a pet to <br/>\ncuddle.  I ask him why he doesn&#39;t also talk about it with his dad <br/>\nbut never answers that question.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son had a reaction a couple of times and he was tested for <br/>\nallergies.  He came back positive for both cats and dogs but since <br/>\nthat time he has been around both many times with little to no <br/>\nreaction.  He does have bad skin rashes but does so with or without <br/>\ncontact with animals.  He refuses to put on the cream that the <br/>\ndoctor has offered.  So I let it go and offer form time to time <br/>\nfiguring if he gets uncomfortable enough he might be willing to try <br/>\nthe cream again.  (We have tried various creams and lotions and he <br/>\njust hates the feel of them on his skin.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband has been quite clear he doesn&#39;t want another pet in the <br/>\nhouse. He has had surgeries and doesn&#39;t feel up to taking care of <br/>\nit. He doesn&#39;t want a pet pooping inside our fence since my son runs <br/>\nbarefoot and he also has his garden. He doesn&#39;t want an inside cat <br/>\nor rabbit. He actually doesn&#39;t seem open to exploring any options.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom an unschooling perspective how can I respect my dh&#39;s <br/>\npreferences without giving up what my son and I <br/>\nwould enjoy?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanne (43)<br/>\ndh: Charlie (50)<br/>\nds: Kevin (6)<br/>\nLake Carmel, NY</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15792,"nextTopicId":15859}}
