If this is your first year homeschooling, your oldest<br/>\nthree are still in the deschooling phase.  There really is a value in<br/>\nbacking off and letting them recuperate from their past school lives.  They<br/>\nalready sound very active and healthy.  I believe boredom is not a bad<br/>\nthing; it is an opportunity for them to explore what they want to do, or to<br/>\nchoose to do nothing.  If they have been used to always doing something,<br/>\nhaving deadlines or deliverables, maybe they subconsciously feel guilty or<br/>\nunsettled at being presented with the choice of doing &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned concern about math; I hope what you&#39;ll find here alleviates<br/>\nthat fear.  We enjoy playing games such as Equate, Monopoly, poker, and one<br/>\nsite we enjoy poking around on is livingmath.net.  The concept, as you<br/>\nprobably guessed, is to realize that math is all around us and we don&#39;t need<br/>\ntextbooks to &quot;learn&quot; it.  Thinking outside the box - there is &quot;math&quot; in art<br/>\nand music and cooking and hopscotch - it&#39;s everywhere and it&#39;s fun!  The<br/>\ncreator of the site, a homeschooling mom, does provide curriculum guides, so<br/>\nit&#39;s not an unschooling site, but you can use it however you like.  We like<br/>\nbrowsing for interesting looking titles - one library book my girls loved<br/>\nwas about the ancient Greek librarian who was the first to measure the<br/>\nearth.  Right now we&#39;re reading &quot;Mathematicians are People Too:  Stories<br/>\nfrom the Lives of Great Mathematicians.&quot;  A most unfortunate and boring<br/>\ntitle, but the snippets (about 4-5 pages per historical figure) really bring<br/>\nthe characters to life.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the Greek philospher Pythagoras began by teaching just one<br/>\nstudent and evolved to having a school of wealthy adult scholars. He divided<br/>\nhis students into two sections: the acoustici, or listeners. The acoustici<br/>\ncould only listen to him lecture from behind a curtain; they hadn&#39;t proven<br/>\nthemselves worthy of observing the lecture. Only after three years of<br/>\nlistening were they allowed into the privileged &quot;mathematici&quot; circle of<br/>\nlearners. He lectured in a white robe with gold sandals on his feet and a<br/>\ngolden wreath as a crown, and he worked his problems in sand on the floor.<br/>\nHe used colored sand to illustrate sections of geometric shapes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe believed that numbers held the answer to everything in the universe, that<br/>\nknowledge was power, and he wanted to control it. His school became the<br/>\n&quot;Secret Brotherhood&quot; aka &quot;Pythagorean School&quot; and it had initiations and<br/>\nrites. They were vegetarian, believing they could be reincarnated as<br/>\nanimals, wouldn&#39;t touch white roosters or eat beans b/c those symbolized<br/>\nperfection. Fire symbolized truth, so they wouldn&#39;t stir it with iron<br/>\npokers. They wore their symbol, a pentagram, on their clothing. And even<br/>\nthough women were in those days not allowed to attend public meetings, he<br/>\nwelcomed women into his school. <br/>\n<br/>\nOthers around them were suspicious of them and in about 500 BC a mob set his<br/>\nmeetinghouse on fire during a class; Pythagorus was killed. But by this time<br/>\nthe Pythagorean School had spread to Sicily and Southern Italy and his<br/>\nknowledge spread.   The only thing I learned in school about him was his<br/>\nPythagorean Theorum. It would have been much more interesting had they<br/>\nbothered to show his quirks and show the living person behind the formulas. <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the books she recommends are available from the library, and it may<br/>\nbe fun reading for your kids while appeasing the math concerns of your<br/>\nhusband - just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon R<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.488 / Virus Database: 269.14.11/1071 - Release Date: 10/15/2007<br/>\n6:48 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Homeschooling dilemma...need help-LONG","postDate":"1192479678","msgId":27133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcxMDE1MTMyMXk3ZDU5MDlkOG8xODhkYjJiYmZjODcwNGRkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MTMxOC40OTU1Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NDMxNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDcxMDE1MTIzMnQ0OTM5MmIzOG1lNmE1ZmEyNDIzYjc4MDM3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDc0MTMxOC40OTU1Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NDMxNC5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27132,"nextInTopic":27134,"prevInTime":27132,"nextInTime":27134,"topicId":27124,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well I just looked the games up and I think if you installed them and poked around a bit you d be surprised at what he s learning by playing.

We started out kinda structured and rapidly went to <br/>\ntotal unschooling. I&#39;ve read the books and love the idea, but I feel <br/>\nlike I&#39;m not &quot;doing&quot; enough. It seems like no actual &quot;work&quot; is ever <br/>\ngetting done. We read a lot, but no one is interested in writing <br/>\nanything, or learning about grammaror math (who wants to do that?) <br/>\nor any one subject for longer than it takes me to get some books and <br/>\nmaterials together. They are seeming to get bored very quickly, then <br/>\nthey want to move onto another topic, and the cycle starts again. <br/>\nAnd I know that true unschooling looks like a lot of random thoughts <br/>\nand ideas that actually fit together to make an education, and I&#39;m <br/>\nprobably just panicking way too early, but I feel like maybe they <br/>\nwould be better off in school. We&#39;re having a really hard time <br/>\nfinding other kids to hang with on a consistent basis, and even when <br/>\nmy kids are in groups with other kids, they tend to cluster together <br/>\nand not mingle. I don&#39;t want to end up with a houseful of kids who <br/>\ncan only interact with each other, y&#39;know? And my oldest (7th grade) <br/>\nis talking about maybe wanting to go to VoTech for highschool, and I <br/>\nknow they&#39;re going to want transcripts, etc, and I honestly don&#39;t <br/>\nknow what they&#39;ve learned so far this year! My ex-husband is <br/>\nrequiring tests-of some sort-on who-knows-what to be done once per <br/>\nmonth and I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m going to show him to appease <br/>\nhim. We have generated almost NO paper! Our normal day consists of <br/>\neveryone getting up, eating (at different times) and then the boys <br/>\nhead off to the library where they spend most of the day on RPG <br/>\ngames and sometimes help out the librarians, while my daughters stay <br/>\nhome and play together and watch tv. There&#39;s a lot of outside play <br/>\nfor the girls and painting/art projects, but the boys aren&#39;t even <br/>\ninterested in doing that. They all help out around the house and <br/>\nhave chores and in the evening we either run to Aikido or <br/>\nbasketball, or stay home where they watch MORE tv! My daughter also <br/>\ndoes gymnastics and piano lessons during the day. So, I guess what <br/>\nI&#39;m looking for is suggestions/ideas and for someone to talk me down <br/>\noff the ledge. I really LOVE having them home with me all the time, <br/>\nand they are doing really well together, and I really don&#39;t want to <br/>\nput them in school as a knee-jerk reaction if this is all part of <br/>\nthe process.
