I care for two <br/>\nof our grandchildren, 12 and 4 months,  full-time.  Recently, I <br/>\nreduced my commitment by two days giving us Wednesdays and Fridays <br/>\noff.  I plan to eliminate Mondays as well in a couple weeks giving <br/>\nme more time with my three unschoolers that I am still actively <br/>\nfacilitating.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn September they start a local co-op that meets on Fridays, so we <br/>\nwill be limited to Mondays and Wednesdays where I can give them my <br/>\nfull attention.  What I would like to do is compile a list of <br/>\ninteresting things to do to keep on the refrigerator with the <br/>\nintention of enabling us to think more effectively on our toes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your plans for the fall?  How do you enjoy spending time <br/>\nwith your young teens?  (Ours are 12ds, almost 15ds and 16dd)  What <br/>\ninterests you?  What interests your teens?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just looking for a creative jump start here so we spend our time <br/>\ndoing more than lunch and a movie.  That&#39;s nice, but we&#39;d like a <br/>\nlittle more variety in our life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16592,"nextTopicId":16582}}
