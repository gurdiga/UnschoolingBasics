Actually, they had a lot of money at the time and I wanted to<br/>\nstudy music. To study music, I had to, by the curriculum of the<br/>\nuniversity, perform a piece on a piano. I asked piano teachers if it<br/>\nwould be possible to learn a piece good enough in half a year as to<br/>\nperform and get accepted. It was possible and many people do it this<br/>\nway, they said. I asked my parents for piano lessons at the time but<br/>\nthey said it wasn&#39;t the right choice for me and it was stupid to<br/>\nthink I could pursue a musical career because &quot;all good musicians<br/>\nstart at 3 years old&quot; or something like that. They didn&#39;t believe in<br/>\nme and still don&#39;t do (ever since I&#39;m nervous when I am to sing in<br/>\nfront of them (Christmas etc.), a vicious cycle: I know I will be<br/>\nnervous and being nervous my voice won&#39;t be as good and then again I<br/>\nwill not be able to &quot;prove it&quot; and then I get more nervous and of<br/>\ncourse I sing badly....) and well, I couldn&#39;t do it at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo---back to the original question: &quot;Should I always get what I want?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did your parents&#39; way get you what you want? How&#39;s that working out <br/>\nfor you?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nto pay singing lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nScrew the singing lessons---go SING!<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t quite understand your issue with blaming the parents. Of<br/>\ncourse, if you as a parent GIVE free choice, then nobody can blame<br/>\nyou. If the parents DON&#39;T GIVE free choice and are rather your<br/>\nenemies, putting stones in your way, how could I not blame them?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can help or hinder. Your hindered. Mine helped. Who has the <br/>\nbetter mind-set?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that blame should be short-lived. Disinterested/hindering <br/>\nparents certainly deserve blame---I think that a parent&#39;s contributions <br/>\ncan be HUGE! And a aprenat who doesn&#39;t contribute at all is at fault. <br/>\nThat&#39;s why I choose to be my children&#39;s facilitator as much as humanly <br/>\npossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after a few years out on your own, it&#39;s time to take responsibility <br/>\nfor your *own* actions---or INactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-===-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd anyway, I wasn&#39;t blaming them – I was just trying to explain the<br/>\nsituation I was it, and show how badly I wanted to sing, that I even<br/>\ndid a shitty job I hated for it, and this in the context of &quot;bad<br/>\ntimes&quot; cause I wasn&#39;t financially supported by my parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s history---what are you dong about it NOW?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can sit and stew about how bad our parents were. And we can whine <br/>\nabout how we&#39;ve turned out. And we can blame our parents for not being <br/>\nthere for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can choose to heal ourselves and become what we always wanted of <br/>\nourselves---AND we can choose to be the parents we wished we&#39;d had.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother also says she&#39;s not responsible for my feelings. So if she<br/>\never treats me bad, and I feel bad – it&#39;s not her fault, since it&#39;s<br/>\n&quot;up to me&quot; if I feel bad!! Good logic! This way you are never guilty<br/>\nand never wrong with what you do, then you never have to change<br/>\nanything even if you hurt other people! And I&#39;m never allowed to<br/>\nblame her? Hm, maybe you could explain, because I don&#39;t really<br/>\nunderstand, or I&#39;m thinking really wrong :-) I&#39;m up to be convinced!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she makes a habit of making you feel bad, whose fault is THAT? I <br/>\nmean---you don&#39;t have to live with her any more---and you don&#39;t have to <br/>\ntake her shit. At this point, you&#39;re CHOOSING to!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d tell that that she is right---she&#39;s not responsible. *I* am. And <br/>\nbecause my feelings are important to me, I&#39;ll choose not to spend time <br/>\nwith those who hurt my feelings. She can choose whether to say hurtful <br/>\nthings or not---but YOU are choosing whether to put yourself in that <br/>\nposition. If the situation remains like this---THEN who&#39;s to blame?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can blame her all you want, and you will always be her child. But <br/>\nyou are not living under her roof any more. And if you are not willing <br/>\nto allow her to hurt you, YOU are the one with the power---not her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s YOUR choice!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

Yes, he puts *many* hours in <br/>\neach day to improve/learn new licks, etc. It IS his &quot;real&quot; job. He <br/>\n*chooses* to make that his priority. He&#39;s backed off on the time he <br/>\nspends watching TV, reading, talking with his girlfriend, and even <br/>\nbeing on the COMPUTER!!!  Because music IS his priority. But that&#39;s <br/>\ntrue of anyone who is looking to make a career of anything. He CHOOSES <br/>\nwhere he spends his time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just told us a week or two ago that you have no passions except for <br/>\nthe computer---now you&#39;re telling us that you have no time for your <br/>\npassion of singing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrop the computer time! Go sing! Quit whining!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n And then there is this big ammount of<br/>\nmillions of people who want the same, there is always someone who is<br/>\nmore skilled than I am (in singing, or in getting to know the &quot;right&quot;<br/>\npeople, in advertising himself, in arranging, in composing etc...)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPuhLEEZE! Quit yer bitchin&#39;!<br/>\n<br/>\nThats what business is ABOUT! Being more skilled, more talented. <br/>\nKnowing more people, advertising yourself, arranging, composing. THAT&#39;s <br/>\nwhat the music industry IS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you willing to DO those things? Don&#39;t go telling me that it&#39;s not <br/>\npossible! I have a now 18 year old son who networks all OVER town and <br/>\nknows ALL the big names here because he would go out every <br/>\nnight---since he was 15---to hear music and sit in on workshops and ask <br/>\nquestions and introduce himself to strangers and play at every possible <br/>\nopportunity. And he&#39;s SHY! Well, he *was*! &lt;g&gt; He MADE the <br/>\nopportunities FOR himself. I can&#39;t go anywhere in town now with him <br/>\nwithout someone coming up to speak to him about music or film. He&#39;s put <br/>\nhimself OUT there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not unique (well, he IS! &lt;g&gt;)---but this is how you make it in the <br/>\nmusic business---you network. You play.

This is just<br/>\nnot the case, because not all people have equal opportunities!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just an excuse. The ONLY way people have made it IS by being <br/>\ncreative, working hard, finding ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nALL people have equal opportunities. Opportunities are OUT there. <br/>\nEverywhere. Every day. But you&#39;re not going to find them sitting in a <br/>\nroom. Get OUT---go to clubs. Sing for tips. Sing for free. Just sing! <br/>\nSing at Open Mike Night---that&#39;s how Cameron ot his first paying gig! <br/>\nHe would go every Wednesday night to Open Mike Night. He played the <br/>\ndrums. Eventually the owner/band leader hired him as the house drummer <br/>\nwhen his old drummer moved to be with his dying mother. Cameron has a <br/>\nyear contract with &quot;Fatback and the Groove Band&quot; as their drummer. A <br/>\npaying gig. Just for showing up every Wednesday for four months!<br/>\n<br/>\nOH! And their singer is also a waitress there--she gets up and sings <br/>\nbetween tables! She can belt out some blues!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd<br/>\nthough what I used to think had nothing to do with the American Dream<br/>\nin the sense of growing rich out of nothing, it still implies that if<br/>\nyou don&#39;t succeed in what you &quot;wanted&quot; – then you probably didn&#39;t<br/>\nwant it enough, or you didn&#39;t try hard enough or you are just lazy or<br/>\ndumb or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUh huh. But you&#39;re going to tell me that you want it enough and are <br/>\ntrying hard enough and aren&#39;t lazy or whatever---right?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t see you out at night singing! You&#39;re spending all your time <br/>\non the computer---you told us so!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t even sing at Christmas in front of your parents!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thinking that &quot;if you only want somehting<br/>\nenough..&quot; made me confident I *would* get it – but I don&#39;t see it<br/>\nhappening at all, and this is since 10, 15 years now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you were at ALL confident. I don&#39;t think you have been <br/>\nout singing anywhere. For 10-15 years---you just *wished* you were a <br/>\nrich and famous singer. *Wanting* something enough and *Going AFTER* <br/>\nsomething enough are two completely diferent things!<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy to say you weren&#39;t responsible for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy to blame parents the FIRST 10-15 years---but after that, it&#39;s up <br/>\nto YOU!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n So the<br/>\ndisappointment of not getting what I wanted has caused many tears<br/>\nover the past 5 years because my goal seems farther and farther away.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd WHAT are you DOing about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThrowing a pity party or going out and singing every night?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they<br/>\n&quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am<br/>\nabout not getting it?

We <br/>\ncan choose to enjoy the journey. Crying every night because we haven&#39;t <br/>\nput forth the effort will never make someone happy either.

I&#39;m getting older (that&#39;s not the point<br/>\n&gt; though), I have children who demand a great deal of time in my life,<br/>\n&gt; I have to work for living and there is just no time left to do<br/>\n&gt; anything like that except for a few hours a month at most. For doing<br/>\n&gt; music, like professionally or even semi-pro., you have to kind of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;work&quot; on it as much as you&#39;d be willing to work for a &quot;real&quot; job, if<br/>\n&gt; you really want to succeed. And then there is this big ammount of<br/>\n&gt; millions of people who want the same, there is always someone who is<br/>\n&gt; more skilled than I am (in singing, or in getting to know the &quot;right&quot;<br/>\n&gt; people, in advertising himself, in arranging, in composing etc...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I used to think &quot;if you only *want* something enough, you&#39;ll get it&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; you just have to work hard, be creative, find ways etc etc. But this<br/>\n&gt; is quite like the &quot;American Dream&quot; – if you really want it, you WILL<br/>\n&gt; get it, it promises, but if you don&#39;t and stay poor, and don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; succeed to always get a greater job and get more money – it means<br/>\n&gt; you are lazy &quot;then you just didn&#39;t work hard enough&quot;. This is just<br/>\n&gt; not the case, because not all people have equal opportunities! And<br/>\n&gt; though what I used to think had nothing to do with the American Dream<br/>\n&gt; in the sense of growing rich out of nothing, it still implies that if<br/>\n&gt; you don&#39;t succeed in what you &quot;wanted&quot; – then you probably didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want it enough, or you didn&#39;t try hard enough or you are just lazy or<br/>\n&gt; dumb or whatever. And thinking that &quot;if you only want somehting<br/>\n&gt; enough..&quot; made me confident I *would* get it – but I don&#39;t see it<br/>\n&gt; happening at all, and this is since 10, 15 years now. So the<br/>\n&gt; disappointment of not getting what I wanted has caused many tears<br/>\n&gt; over the past 5 years because my goal seems farther and farther away.<br/>\n&gt; So unschooled children, won&#39;t they always be very confident they<br/>\n&gt; &quot;will&quot; get what they want and then be also as disappointed as I am<br/>\n&gt; about not getting it? I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has<br/>\n&gt; taken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course, unschooled children are given all the possibilities and<br/>\n&gt; always taken serious about what they want and so on – but it just may<br/>\n&gt; be that some of their wishes cannot become true (?) and then they<br/>\n&gt; might not be able to deal with that disappointment (?) I guess that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what people mean when they say that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;deal with<br/>\n&gt; the real world&quot; (although I find that unschooled kids are far more in<br/>\n&gt; the &quot;real world&quot; than school kids but...)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Greetings<br/>\n&gt; Johanna<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I&#39;m learning to deal with it though but it has  <br/>\ntaken years of crying each month for not being completely happy :-(&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow...I have SO much to say on this topic,but I&#39;ll try to be brief. If<br/>\nsinging is what truly brings you joy, then you can access that joy<br/>\nanytimes you wish. It sounds like you have this very exact, concrete<br/>\nversion of what &quot;success&quot; looks like in your life and anything less is<br/>\na &quot;failure&quot;. Not a great way to approach your passions.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet GO of your version of anything. Get out of that tiny little box<br/>\nyou&#39;ve put your dreams into and start approaching what you love with<br/>\nabandon! Do it because it makes you happy. Sing because you have a<br/>\nbeautiful voice and create opportunities to follow your passion within<br/>\nthe live you CHOSE for yourself. You chose exactly where you are<br/>\ntoday. You chose the children, the lifestyle...all of it. And if you<br/>\ncan begin to see it all as a choice to be enjoyed, then what is there<br/>\nto cry about?<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a very concrete version of &quot;success&quot; will limit you. Maybe the<br/>\nuniverse has a better idea of how that voice will enrich your life and<br/>\nthe world!! Pursuing your passion is part of it, but trusting the flow<br/>\nof life is another big part. That doesn&#39;t make us passive<br/>\nparticipants, but it does open a person up for change/flow and the<br/>\nability to ADAPT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooled kids, while perfectly able to acheive their dreams<br/>\nand goals, will be much less rigid than schooled minds. They KNOW that<br/>\nlife throws curveballs at us. They are creative thinkers!! Having a<br/>\ndefined version of success is not even part of my children&#39;s lives!<br/>\nNot mine either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do what we love, we go where that leads. If one thing doesn&#39;t work<br/>\nout the way we planned, we can go in a new direction. It&#39;s all good!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as singing, there are so many independent artists that record<br/>\ntheir own CD&#39;s. Have you ever done that? Maybe just having your own CD<br/>\ncould be a life goal regardless of whether ANYONE buys it! Maybe<br/>\nsinging for weddings or local shows occasionally would be fun? Maybe<br/>\ngiving singing lessons would be a part-time way to keep in touch with<br/>\nwhat you love while still being available for your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound very &quot;stuck&quot; in your ideas and passions. Loosen up. Crying<br/>\nabout what you don&#39;t have isn&#39;t going to help you find your joy. You<br/>\nhave your voice, you&#39;re alive, you could live to be 100 and how are<br/>\nyou going to spend the rest of your time here? Make it GREAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I should always get what I want","postDate":"1159797247","msgId":17717,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVmcjVsditkdjg4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDlCN0NCNzYxLUEyRkQtNDc3NS1BN0ZBLTg5NDcyQ0UzNEFBQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17716,"nextInTopic":17718,"prevInTime":17716,"nextInTime":17718,"topicId":17683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We&#39;ve worked hard to get the best software  <br/>\navailable (we make electronic music, I sing to it), but it seems  <br/>\nthere is just no time left – and this even though my daughter is at  <br/>\nschool, and we should have &quot;time&quot;, but we just don&#39;t have – and I  <br/>\nDON&#39;T use all my time cleaning up, it&#39;s rather chaotic in the  <br/>\nhouse... We have only small amounts of time in which nothing really  <br/>\ncan be done, besides writing e-mails or reading a bit – and now with  <br/>\nunschooling it is less time even :-) You know, these 5 Minutes in  <br/>\nbetween or 10 or maybe 30 sometimes before the next &quot;Mama!&quot; comes...  <br/>\nand by the end of the day, when there would finally be like 1-2 hours  <br/>\nI&#39;m so exhausted I have no muse to make music or sing or compose.  <br/>\nSince we are unschooling there is even less time and by the time we  <br/>\nwill be able to fully unschool, take her off from school I&#39;ll even  <br/>\nhave less time, so I really don&#39;t see it happen at all. The one thing  <br/>\nI did though is that I&#39;m teaching Spanish through songs, each lesson  <br/>\nis based on a spanish song, and I bring my guitar and we sing, it is  <br/>\nmuch fun.

I think that what you wanted <br/>\nis a particular relationship, a way of being treated and seen, <br/>\nknown . I think it is important to explore this and not be confused <br/>\nby a chosen  container , a concrete expression that you can hold on <br/>\nto. I think what you want may be  available , but that there are <br/>\nmany wishes and motivations involved. I think being too stuck in the <br/>\nconcrete and not undrstanding your emotional expereince is a <br/>\nmistake, keeping it concrete is a way to have or not, ( but not <br/>\nreally be engaged with being)it is a splitting, yes -no , good -bad, <br/>\nthis allows you to flip back and forth between two modes of being <br/>\nand I beleive to be strangulated ways to experience the world. i <br/>\nthink both are very molded from past ways you have forged to deal <br/>\nwith pressures and emotional experiences  as best as you could in <br/>\nthe past. I think you can do better now, to try to delve more deeply <br/>\ninto your desires and wishes and try to understand what you wanted <br/>\nand from whom, and to explore the relationships and past losses. I <br/>\nfeel what you describe as what you always wanted is something that <br/>\nyou weren&#39;t allowed to experience as a child and again I don&#39;t mean <br/>\nthis concretely but emotionally. I think what your expressing in <br/>\nyour sadness is an attempt a true wish to give up this past <br/>\ninsistance on getting ( entitlement) of what we all ideally do <br/>\ndeserve as children. I think your pondering attempting to let this <br/>\ngo and engage with what is present for you. I think this scares you <br/>\nas you somewhat bleakly desribe your economic situation. I think <br/>\nartistic  creative processes allow us to see and experience a <br/>\nreality that is open, to continually allow a flow of new ideas and <br/>\nemotional experiences that saturate our preconceptions but also <br/>\nallow these new conceptions to become unsaturated anew. I think your <br/>\nwish of singing is powerful and is a rich source of life and hope <br/>\nand faith, but that your idea of seeing this as successful is not so <br/>\nhealthy, is annonymous approval and about getting what you didn&#39;t <br/>\nbefore, I think that singing is a very good venue to explore your <br/>\nemotions and understanding of your experience , I also think that <br/>\nthe community or fan base you really need is one of like minded <br/>\nmusicians who explore art for its wisdom beauty and grace and not <br/>\nfor its vaidation in a commodity based society that is estranged <br/>\nfrom trying to get what it wants but settles for a dull drone . <br/>\nsorry for the rambling nature and this is meant as an expression of <br/>\nexperiences I have had and trying to project them upon your <br/>\nsituation.

We have the <br/>\nability to make choices.  Sometimes  we are willing to do something we don&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily want, to get what we want in  the end.  Like a job.  Although if I really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t like a job I  wouldn&#39;t stay.

She cleans the stalls, feeds them, grooms them and <br/>\nlearns how to ride and jump.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis friend has taken Shawna to a seminar with Pat Parelli, who she <br/>\nmet and spoke to afterwards. He and his wife gave Shawna copied of <br/>\ntheir dvd&#39;s and have e-mailed her to see how she is. This same <br/>\nfriend also took her to a horse sale and they watched race horses <br/>\nbeing auctioned.

She&#39;s well liked within the horse community here and <br/>\nnot being in school has enabled her to pursue opportunites she may <br/>\nnot have been able to. Horses are a big part of her life and she&#39;s <br/>\nput herself out there and made a lot happen in a short time.

I <br/>\nwould never have been able to move from the only home I knew in <br/>\nNew York City after living through September 11.

Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure mine *will* always get what they want. What&#39;s the opposite of <br/>\nthat? *Never* getting what you want? Getting *nothing* you want? YUCK!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy modelling how I get what I want and by brainstorming ways that my <br/>\nboys get what they want/need, I think they&#39;ll be able to make their own <br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we *should* all get what we need---and all work to get what we <br/>\nwant. My boys see me do both of those things ---for me, for their dad, <br/>\nand for them. They don&#39;t see things magically appear---nor do they <br/>\nexpect that (after a certain age, I should probably say! &lt;g&gt;) because <br/>\nthey see the effort we put into their/our wants & needs. They <br/>\nsee/experience natural limitations (car died, need to put off <br/>\nsomething---what?--and how to reorganize to get that thing back in the <br/>\nqueue?) and natural consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is not getting what he wants/needs at a job (or in life), he <br/>\nprobably needs to look for a new job that gives him what he needs OR <br/>\nreorganize to see where he *can* get that thing or where he make <br/>\nchanges to fit it in. THAT&#39;s what we&#39;re modelling. *HOW* to get what we <br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that *I* can get what I want. It may not be right away---or it <br/>\nmight. I *really* want to move to the mountains of VA---have a little <br/>\nfarm, be more secluded. Cameron&#39;s ready to move with me! &lt;g&gt; But <br/>\nDuncan, at ten, still needs to be here. Ben&#39;s current job came with a <br/>\nfive year commitment---possibly eight years! His job is too sweet right <br/>\nnow to leave it. It&#39;s allowing us to do many other things (NOT make the <br/>\nmove right now though!). We *could* go ahead and buy the land, but that <br/>\nwould put several brakes on here. So I&#39;m giving up my *immediate* dream <br/>\nfor a while so that we can fulfill others here. I&#39;m OK with that. I <br/>\nthink the boys would all jump at giving me my farm if I really needed <br/>\nto put that dream first. I know they would. But there are so many other <br/>\nthings that we, as a family, find more important, so I&#39;m putting mine <br/>\noff. I&#39;ll get my farm, just a little later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m making do and fulfilling parts of the dream by gardening and <br/>\nkeeping bees and researching and eventually getting chickens---small <br/>\nsteps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey see each of us give a little to make it work for all of us. They <br/>\nalso see that the more we give, the more we get in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *want* my boys to always get what they want. Me too! Sometimes we <br/>\njust need to devise creative ways to get there! And sometimes we need <br/>\nhelp. By helping my boys now, I hope they&#39;ll help themselves, help <br/>\nothers, and even help me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nI figure mine *will* always get what they want. What&#39;s the opposite of <br/>\nthat? *Never* getting what you want? Getting *nothing* you want? YUCK!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy modelling how I get what I want and by brainstorming ways that my <br/>\nboys get what they want/need, I think they&#39;ll be able to make their own <br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we *should* all get what we need---and all work to get what we <br/>\nwant. My boys see me do both of those things ---for me, for their dad, <br/>\nand for them. They don&#39;t see things magically appear---nor do they <br/>\nexpect that (after a certain age, I should probably say! &lt;g&gt;) because <br/>\nthey see the effort we put into their/our wants & needs. They <br/>\nsee/experience natural limitations (car died, need to put off <br/>\nsomething---what?--and how to reorganize to get that thing back in the <br/>\nqueue?) and natural consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is not getting what he wants/needs at a job (or in life), he <br/>\nprobably needs to look for a new job that gives him what he needs OR <br/>\nreorganize to see where he *can* get that thing or where he make <br/>\nchanges to fit it in. THAT&#39;s what we&#39;re modelling. *HOW* to get what we <br/>\nwant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that *I* can get what I want. It may not be right away---or it <br/>\nmight. I *really* want to move to the mountains of VA---have a little <br/>\nfarm, be more secluded. Cameron&#39;s ready to move with me! &lt;g&gt; But <br/>\nDuncan, at ten, still needs to be here. Ben&#39;s current job came with a <br/>\nfive year commitment---possibly eight years! His job is too sweet right <br/>\nnow to leave it. It&#39;s allowing us to do many other things (NOT make the <br/>\nmove right now though!). We *could* go ahead and buy the land, but that <br/>\nwould put several brakes on here. So I&#39;m giving up my *immediate* dream <br/>\nfor a while so that we can fulfill others here. I&#39;m OK with that. I <br/>\nthink the boys would all jump at giving me my farm if I really needed <br/>\nto put that dream first. I know they would. But there are so many other <br/>\nthings that we, as a family, find more important, so I&#39;m putting mine <br/>\noff. I&#39;ll get my farm, just a little later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m making do and fulfilling parts of the dream by gardening and <br/>\nkeeping bees and researching and eventually getting chickens---small <br/>\nsteps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey see each of us give a little to make it work for all of us. They <br/>\nalso see that the more we give, the more we get in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *want* my boys to always get what they want. Me too! Sometimes we <br/>\njust need to devise creative ways to get there! And sometimes we need <br/>\nhelp. By helping my boys now, I hope they&#39;ll help themselves, help <br/>\nothers, and even help me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
