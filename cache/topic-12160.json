He loved them and would ask me for words all the time. Then he wasn&#39;t asking so much. I took him out of school in December. By June he was reading Harry Potter on his own.

Courtney&#39;s first attempt at riding a bike without training wheels was about a year and a half ago.

Then she asked our neighbor and again crashed as soon as she let go. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So then she told us to leave her alone and she spent about 2 hours sitting on her bike with her feet on the ground just walking up and down the sidewalk.

As you can see, &quot;parent initiated&quot; is all<br/>\nabout us having fun together, spending time enjoying our day and<br/>\nliving well. I often tell people that if Living is Learning, then all<br/>\nwe really need to worry about is living WELL. Make LIFE good and there<br/>\nwill be learning happening all the time. We share the day to day swirl<br/>\nof information as partners.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am constantly looking up stuff to do in this area and all along the<br/>\nAppalachians (these mountains are FULL of cool stuff). I offer, they<br/>\nchoose. They ask, I research.

It is so tempting to make <br/>\nthe mistake and &#39;help&#39; her.  I just want to get in there and <br/>\nsuggest, &quot;If you would first take the largest number and then add in <br/>\nthe smaller number it would make things so much easier.&quot;  But this <br/>\nwee suggestion could derail the entire process and even discourage <br/>\nher entirely from continuing her investigations with numbers.  So, <br/>\nunless she invites me into her learning world, I stay quiet.  I do <br/>\nnot help, I do not teach, I do not make comments and I do not <br/>\nsay, &#39;good job&#39;.  Any of those things are disrespectful to her <br/>\nlearning, potentially disrupt the process and rob her of her <br/>\nexperience.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I do slip up and offer the uninvited help occasionally, <br/>\nbut my kids catch me and remind me, &quot;No uninvited teaching, Mommy.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I see my kids frustrated with some project or something they <br/>\nare learning, I will directly ask them if I have their invitation to <br/>\nhelp.  If they say, no, I get out of their way.  It&#39;s hard to watch <br/>\nthem crying in frustration, but I honor their request.  Sometimes, <br/>\nmy 6 year old&#39;s crying will continue to crescendo, so I help her <br/>\ncalm down first and might offer my help again.  Sometimes she <br/>\naccepts my help and sometimes she declines.  If she declines, I <br/>\nremind myself that their will be another time, another day where she <br/>\nwill revisit the topic.   The second go around she will most likely <br/>\nhave a new connection or new perspective to add that will make her <br/>\nlearning more fulfilling.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne night my son was spouting off about his Pokemon and I was just a <br/>\nbit too tired for it all at the time, so I said, &quot;No uninvited <br/>\nteaching, DS.&quot;  My son smiled and immediately stopped so I could get <br/>\non to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, I GOT to get to bed.<br/>\nGood Night,<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"aplan4life","from":"&quot;aplan4life&quot; &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: A newbie question","postDate":"1145240969","msgId":12163,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxdXVpOSthNG5nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxdXNyMSsxMTVhakBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":12160,"nextInTopic":12169,"prevInTime":12162,"nextInTime":12164,"topicId":12160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ren, would you mind giving some examples on how you might initiate something without making the children feel as though you are teaching? ...
