From an  <br/>\nautism perspective, three things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I know that it seems like he&#39;s not rational, but if he knows  <br/>\nenough to say insulting things to hurt her, then he knows enough to  <br/>\nlearn something else to say. What happens when he says something? How  <br/>\ndo you step in? Does she respond immediately in a negative manner or  <br/>\nhave you coached her to try something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. It&#39;s not easy, I understand. With our children, sometimes just  <br/>\nhearing me tell Breanna &quot;That is not okay to say&quot; is enough (her  <br/>\nfavorite thing right now is from Monsters Inc &quot;You stupid, pathetic  <br/>\nwaste...&quot;)<br/>\nIt is hurtful, and I felt it was important that my girls hear from me  <br/>\nthat it is not okay for people to treat them so disrespectfully. They  <br/>\nunderstand that Bre has autism, but that still wears on you after a  <br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Seems to me that this has become a ritual for him, that it&#39;s a  <br/>\nquick and easy way to create an interaction with his sister. And it&#39;s  <br/>\nbecome so set in stone that he really can&#39;t see past it. He knows it  <br/>\nwill get a reaction, and he doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s positive or  <br/>\nnegative, because it&#39;s the only way he knows RIGHT NOW to be social.  <br/>\nFor us it took some coaching on both the part of Breanna and her  <br/>\nsisters. I would set up situations like, if Breanna got a hershey  <br/>\nbar, I would ask her to take one to a sister. Or, I would coach the  <br/>\nsister to say &quot;That really hurts, let&#39;s play your favorite game  <br/>\ninstead&quot; I made it worth THEIR while to try and initiate when they  <br/>\nwere younger, to build some positive things, because the siblings and  <br/>\nI would have date nights, primarily just to spend time together, but  <br/>\nit was also a good time to brainstorm how to handle certain situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easier now that they are older, Bre is 11, Emily 9 and Rachel 8.  <br/>\nThe girls have learned to blow some of it off, Dan still gets mad,  <br/>\nand overall Breanna is doing a lot better with a kindness. It takes a  <br/>\nLOT of work from you, so I don&#39;t know that your stress will decrease  <br/>\nimmediately, but perhaps it will help to know that it&#39;s just a  <br/>\nseason, and that it will get better. I had to be there all the time  <br/>\nfor a long time, and it was hard. Housework went.

I have a 9 year old, 7 year old with nonverbal autism , and a 5 year old. <br/>\nThe 7 and 5 year olds are in school this year though I&#39;m thinking of pulling my 5 year old but...thats a whole nother post :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year my autistic son was biting, screaming, fits , up alllll night,  was having to drive him around at 2 in the morning because the screaming was so bad he was waking both families in our duplex and having to pin him down several times a day because he was so violent he had convered himself in bruises and couldnt risk him further injuring himself or others. Thankfully with a diet change and ongoing visits to specialists things are getting better but he still requires a lot of my attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is how things look like in our house during summer break, weekends . evenings...when all the kids are here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a couple of teenagers that trade off and I try to have one of them over at least once a week for an hour or 2. They are a wonderful help and I&#39;m right here if a kid needs me. Sometimes they take one or more children outside for a while and I speed clean, sometimes they are just in charge of Nate and i have a chance to do an art project with the girls without Nate eating crayons, dumping paint, etc etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nCourtney usually wakes up long enough to get in the van while we take dad and Alyssa to work/school and then sleeps in untill 11. This way she can stay up late at night after the younger 2 go to bed. This is usualy when she does her drawing, reading...some playing on the computer. We usualy spend 11-2:30 just us together on school days. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen all the kids are off school nate tends to get upset easier because his routine is off and my girls tend to start fighting with each other. When the girls start fighting i tend to either start acting really silly to make them laugh or go hey ! lets go ... outside and look for pretty leaves to make something neat with, play on the swingset, make some ooblek, go get an icee , blow some bubbles, see the horse across the street.....etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nTimes when Nate is really upset and the girls need me I end up telling them I have to help Nate calm down right now but Ill...x in a little while then making a mental note about it and going to them a few minutes later and saying ok did you still want to ...x? ...and going from there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings will always come up and such but I think you just have to keep shuffling things around and trying new stuff. Hold on to the stuff that works and ditch it when it quits working. Put the stuff that dosent work now on the back burner because it might be just the answer in 6 months. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk quick question... Is your 9 year old asking for school or it is more pressure from the family?. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry that children never listen to you : worry that they are always watching you--Robert Fulghum <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Too much on my plate","postDate":"1224771146","msgId":36684,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgxMDIzMDcxMmg1OWIzYzA3eWJlODhkNTcxZWU4Yjk4MThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWM5MzRjZiRmMTJhMGZiMCRkMzdlMmYxMCRAY29tLmF1Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMjQwMWM5MzRjZiRmMTJhMGZiMCRkMzdlMmYxMCRAY29tLmF1Pg=="},"prevInTopic":36681,"nextInTopic":36686,"prevInTime":36683,"nextInTime":36685,"topicId":36677,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can you see these things developing before they get there?
