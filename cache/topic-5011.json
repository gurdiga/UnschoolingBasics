She went to preschool 2 mornings a week, but<br/>\nthat wasn&#39;t very schoolish.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, we bought Miquon Math workbooks for her when a<br/>\nfriend of ours was selling them. We never asked her to<br/>\ndo any worksheets. She did a few when the books were<br/>\nnew and then they were put away till 2 days ago. Then<br/>\nshe pulled them out and did many pages in the<br/>\nafternoon and late at night. I mentioned to dh that<br/>\nshe seems to be treating them the same as she treats a<br/>\nnew computer game. Then last night she pulled out the<br/>\nworkbook again and we did a couple pages. Then I<br/>\nturned to a page that she didn&#39;t like and she said, &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like this game, I want to find another one.&quot; So<br/>\nshe does really think of them as a game or just<br/>\nanother interesting activity. I think this is a very<br/>\ndifferent attitude from one that a kid who&#39;s been<br/>\nschooled and done tons of worksheets would have.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nDo you Yahoo!? <br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

My dd now aged 11 had a terrible time adjusting after coming out of school and could only do school type things. It has taken her 4 years to be able to do things in a different way and now she is a very motivated child who learns by lots of means not just workbooks or sheets e.t.c. She hardly looks at workbooks anymore but it was a confidence thing with her.She was worried she would not learn the &quot;right things&quot;. Now she knows there is not right or wrong learning and all learning is learning she has blossomed.  As a by product of letting go of the schooly work she discovered she is a very good artist and spends a lot of time each day drawing and painting.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThis email and all attachments have been electronically scanned by Kingston<br/>\nCommunications&#39; email Anti-Virus service and no known viruses were detected.<br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help!","postDate":"1110563615","msgId":5012,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMzExMTc1MzM1LjEzNjU3LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"NjY2Nw=="},"prevInTopic":5011,"nextInTopic":5013,"prevInTime":5011,"nextInTime":5013,"topicId":5011,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Unschooling is NOT avoiding books or structure, some children demand structure.

She just started homeschooling her kids, and I was sharing how important I think deschooling is.  She said &#39;yes, but the kids are asking me when they&#39;re going to start learning something.&#39;  I reminded her that life is learning, all the time.

Not by any stretch. So <br/>\nmany parents get caught up in that trap. Yes, some kids adore <br/>\nstructure to their days. What this means is helping them plan, <br/>\ncoming up with their own guideline for the day, so they know what is <br/>\nhappening. Just because a child likes to have things planned out, <br/>\nor &quot;structured&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean they need lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome children love workbooks.

Until <br/>\nthere is a need for information, it&#39;s silly to try and get it into <br/>\none&#39;s head. We trust that our children love to learn and will learn <br/>\nthe unique things they need for their own life&#39;s journey in their <br/>\nown time. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5000,"nextTopicId":5017}}
