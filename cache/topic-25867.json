She LOVED it. They started from scratch nominating <br/>\ndifferent people to run, debates, campaigning, and a final election. The had <br/>\nthree parties running, but no democrats or republicans. The idea was to try <br/>\nand keep kids focused on the issues and not the party, so they gave <br/>\nthemselves names.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was interesting to watch the debates. The kids in the audiences asked <br/>\nsuch great questions. I was in the back of the room just to sneak a peek, <br/>\nand I was so impressed that my daughter asked such intelligent questions. <br/>\nAnd being kids, there were lots of funny questions. But that even made it <br/>\nbetter to see how each candidate answered. And yes, the same issue that come <br/>\nup in the presidential campaign came up here. The big ones were abortion, <br/>\nstem cell research, and immigration, but the hottest debate was over the <br/>\nlegal driving age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids ranged in age 10 ish to 20. You had to be 12 to run, but my 9 year <br/>\nold was heart broken that I didn&#39;t sign her up. She joined in the <br/>\ncampaigning some on her own. Next time we see this come up, she is set on <br/>\ngoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 13 and 16 year old daughters wanted to do this when we signed up, but <br/>\nonly the 13 year old actually decided to go. She was so worked up by the end <br/>\nof the day that she said she thought she had to much caffeine in her system. <br/>\nFunny thing is, she hadn&#39;t had caffeine. I mentioned this to her and she got <br/>\nuncontrollable giggles. It was like she sleep deprived or something. But she <br/>\ntalked to me for one solid hour about all of it and then when we got home <br/>\nher Dad heard a solid hour,  it was great to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love,<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLearn.Laugh.Share.
