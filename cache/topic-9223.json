I think maybe they spend to much time together. They have other friends, (very few) but are in public school all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am going to recommend the very best book I&#39;ve found on this topic -- Siblings Without Rivalry, by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish.  You can probably find it at your local library, but really you&#39;ll want to own it, so go ahead and buy a copy.  It has some really good insights into why the kids fight, how they end up in roles (with our help) that perpetuate the fighting and ideas for how to stop the fighting.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, take a moment to think about how you see your children -- you opened by telling us your daughter is bossy, and that your oldest picks on the younger ones, and you spoke about how your youngest gets along with everyone, because he just wants to please.  So, the baby is the pleasing child, the middle one is bossy -- what role does that leave for the oldest child?  Good (people pleaser) child is already taken, powerful (bossy) child is already taken -- not many desirable roles left, are there?  Don&#39;t forget, too, that before they came along, he was the only child, not requiring any sort of role at all.  With only a sister, at least he was the only boy.  Now that a brother has been added -- an eager to please one, at that -- he&#39;s no longer &#39;the&#39; boy, just &#39;a&#39; boy.  And not being recognized as a good one.  So often, the roles and characteristics assigned to a child by a parent are self-fulfilling (and self-defeating).  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  It might help to start by looking at each of your children and your perception of them.  Maybe make a list, finding more positive ways to describe the undesirable traits -- bossy could be &#39;purposeful&#39; or &#39;leadership qualities&#39; that someday may take her far professionally.  It also helps me to recognize that the most troublesome traits for me to handle in my kids are either those that don&#39;t fall far from the tree (my kids are definitely MY kids!) or that remind me of my own siblings, which tends to put me right back in that 8yo powerless world.  It can be really scary and hard to think rationally in those moments.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

It <br/>\ncan come from anywhere - including TV and video games. They are <br/>\nlearning all the time, as Ren said, if you can say after 3 months <br/>\nthat they haven&#39;t learned anything, then it&#39;ll probably be a first. <br/>\nDon&#39;t *tell* them Okay all rules are off.

The next three months you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to worry about what is &quot;educational&quot; for your children, you<br/>\ndon&#39;t need to cover any topics or do any projects.<br/>\nYou need to plan your summer vacation around doing the things that<br/>\nbring all of you JOY. Watch tv with them, rent movies, go for walks,<br/>\nplay games because it&#39;s FUN (no &quot;educational&quot; games allowed), paint,<br/>\ndraw, wiggle your toes, feel LIFE flowing through you and around you<br/>\nevery moment!!<br/>\nYou are only allowed to do things because they&#39;re FUN, it&#39;s summer<br/>\nvacation right?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo this for the next three months and please report back to us if your<br/>\nchildren learn absolutely nothing (because they&#39;ll be the first<br/>\nchildren EVER).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, if you get to the end of the vacation and realize you were all<br/>\nlearning while having fun, you might just decide to keep on being on<br/>\nvacation....and then you&#39;ll realize you&#39;re actually UNSCHOOLING!!<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":214292242,"authorName":"Aisha Abdul Rahman","from":"&quot;Aisha Abdul Rahman&quot; &lt;muslimah4allah@...&gt;","profile":"aisha_ladon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New at unschooling","postDate":"1137616533","msgId":9223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxbThxbCttMHNkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9227,"prevInTime":9222,"nextInTime":9224,"topicId":9223,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not sure if what I am trying to do is unschooling.
