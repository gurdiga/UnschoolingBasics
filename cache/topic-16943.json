I didn&#39;t really consider <br/>\nhomeschooling as a choice either until the summer after 4th grade. All <br/>\nI can tell you as far as healing is deschool, deschool, deschool. My <br/>\noldest is so much happier. He thanks us for taking him out of school. <br/>\nHe&#39;s so glad not to have to go anymore.

My first one <br/>\nis how do you let go of the anger, frustration and guilt, of leaving <br/>\nkids in a public school for so long?  Mine have been bullied  the <br/>\nwhole time they were in school, and nothing was ever done to stop <br/>\nit.  We did go through all of the channels, and nothing <br/>\nhappened/worked.  My son was going to be in 5th grade this year, and <br/>\nmy daughter in 4th.  Had I known about the homeschooling earlier, I <br/>\nwould&#39;ve done it before.  Some people don&#39;t agree with us <br/>\nhomeschooling-they think my kids should endure all the problems, and <br/>\nlearn to deal with it.  I and my hubby don&#39;t agree-that&#39;s where the <br/>\nfrustration comes in.  The anger and guilt is from all of the stuff <br/>\nthey&#39;ve had to put up with, (guilt), and the other is from having to <br/>\ndeal with it, going through all of the channels, and banging our <br/>\nheads on the wall, when nothing was taken care of.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to my second question.  I&#39;ve read that the state has <br/>\nrequired &quot;subjects&quot; that the kids are supposed to know.  How do you <br/>\nfit that in with &quot;unschooling&quot;, or do you just not worry about it?  <br/>\nMy idea is to let my kids get excited about learning again, (I think <br/>\nit was lost when they were made to learn things they had no interest <br/>\nin, in school), and to relax, and enjoy living life.  I don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to have any added stress and pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny/all advice is welcome.  I can use any ideas to get started, <br/>\ncheap/free field trips to go on, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso is anyone in the group from South Lyon?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nVanessa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16875,"nextTopicId":16977}}
