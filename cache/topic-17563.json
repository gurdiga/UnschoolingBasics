If I<br/>\ncan pull it off &lt;g&gt;, it will have a program similar to the Live and<br/>\nLearn Conference with some speakers, discussion groups, raffles,<br/>\nfunshops, a talent show, etc. Maybe even a few surprises of our own.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I get too far into the planning, I need to know how much<br/>\ninterest there is in having a NW conference of this type.<br/>\nSpecifically, I&#39;m trying to get a feel for about how many might come<br/>\nand how big a hotel we would need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be held in Oregon, most likely Corvallis but definitely<br/>\nsomewhere from Eugene to Portland. I don&#39;t yet know how long we&#39;d make<br/>\nit or how much it would cost. That will all depend on how many are<br/>\ninterested. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you&#39;d like a NW conference, now&#39;s the time to speak up. Let me<br/>\nknow if you&#39;d be likely to come and if you&#39;d stay at the hotel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17582,"nextTopicId":17380}}
