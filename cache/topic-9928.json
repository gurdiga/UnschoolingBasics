Typically, an applicant would take the <br/>\nSAT/ACT (just like any other applicant) and provide some sort of <br/>\nadditional info - portfolio is one way, curriculum vitae (kind of <br/>\nlike a life resume) is another, some schools have forms for <br/>\nhomeschoolers to help them put their real life stuff into categories <br/>\nso that they can figure it all out...it varies. State <br/>\ncolleges/universities tend to be more rigid with requirements (at <br/>\nthis point in time) than private ones because the same state system <br/>\nthat runs the public schools tends to also have a hand in the state <br/>\ncollege system. There are books available out there (I believe Cafi <br/>\nCohen has written a couple) on preparing for college when you <br/>\nhomeschool. But, I&#39;d say to stop worrying about that for now - how <br/>\ndo you know that your kids will (a) want to go to college? (b) want <br/>\nto go at age 17 or 18? My DH worked for a decade (high tech jobs) <br/>\nbefore starting college when he found something he loved and wanted <br/>\nto pursue with that resource. Look at college as another resource <br/>\nnot as the be-all end-all required thing that we&#39;ve been trained to <br/>\nconsider it. It&#39;s not. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;And what about keeping track of classes for high school <br/>\n&gt; credit?  How does an unschooler graduate?

Even if you did school at home, they wouldn&#39;t &quot;graduate&quot; <br/>\nfrom high school in the same way as schools do (although some hs <br/>\ngroups have graduation ceremonies and all for those who want to do <br/>\nthat). GED is not necessary in most cases - they just put <br/>\ndown &quot;Graduated? Yes 2015 homeschooled&quot; on forms/applications <br/>\n(unless your state required you to have a private school name, then <br/>\nthey can just use that for &#39;school name&#39;).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have noticed in my 4 yo ds that he&#39;s a GREAT unschooler!
