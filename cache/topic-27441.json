I haven&#39;t read all of the posts, due to lack of time <br/>\ntoday, so forgive me if I repeat advice you have already been given.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids ages 15, 12, and almost 9 have basically been unschooled <br/>\ntheir entire lives, with the exception of my oldest who we tried <br/>\ncurriculums with when he was very young but quickly through them <br/>\nout.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKev, my oldest, decided he wanted to give school a try this year <br/>\ntoo.  I was so sad at his decision but didn&#39;t say a whole lot, <br/>\nbesides any concerns I had for him.  I supported him in his decision <br/>\nbecause that is part of what unschooling is <br/>\nabout................TRUST.  We trust them to know what they need, <br/>\nwhen they need it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, he is 2 1/2 months into school; it has been a mostly positive <br/>\nexperience for him but he thinks it is a BIG waste of time!!  He has <br/>\nno time for the things that are meaningful to him, the things that he <br/>\nis really passionate about, and there is really no social life at <br/>\nschool like he thought there would be and for that reason he has <br/>\ndecided to not go to school next year.  For whatever reason though he <br/>\nis determined to stick it out the entire year.  When I ask him why he <br/>\nsays so that he can say he did it. It&#39;s hard to watch him barely able <br/>\nto wake up and grumble about how stupid it is as he joins the masses <br/>\nbut it is what he is CHOOSING to do so........  I would rather have <br/>\nhim say that he did it and he hated it than to blame me for a lost <br/>\nexperience that he felt he needed to have. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of his reasons initially for wanting to go to school were <br/>\nbecause of the Japanese program they have at his school, he thought <br/>\nit would enrich his social life, and a lot of his friends were <br/>\ngoing.  He was also just curious about what this thing called school, <br/>\ner jail, was all about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think they are capable of figuring it out and they know with <br/>\nunschooling parents they have a soft place to land and lots of <br/>\nsupport AND the choice to come home when and if they want to.

How did you handle your personal feelings about institutionalized<br/>\nlearning while respecting their need to experience these things themselves?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 12yo son Sam did go.  He&#39;s much like you describe your daughter, confident <br/>\nand usually makes friends easily.  He had a lot of the same reasons, wanting <br/>\nto see what it was like.  I could relate because I tend to be curious and a <br/>\nbit of a risk-taker, I think under the same circumstances it would&#39;ve bothered <br/>\nme not to  *know* what I was missing.  Yet of course, I also had feelings that <br/>\nI had failed and that he was rejecting the path I&#39;d chosen because I thought <br/>\nit was so much better for him.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo he went to the local public school for 5th grade.  And it was awful for me <br/>\nat first, not because the school was so bad, but because it was relatively <br/>\n&quot;good,&quot; and much of what I&#39;d told him didn&#39;t turn out to be true, and it was a <br/>\nreal shot to my credibility!  LOL    He *didn&#39;t* get a lot of homework, kids <br/>\nwere nice and there wasn&#39;t any bullying, and the teacher was fairly progressive <br/>\nin that she didn&#39;t assign busywork but used more of a unit study approach <br/>\nwhere they did projects to cover more than one subject.  So he liked it...made <br/>\nlots of friends, played soccer at recess, got elected class president, and talked <br/>\nabout how great it was and I really tried my best to be happy for him.  My <br/>\ndaughter was still at home though, and completely happy with that choice, so <br/>\nthat helped.  And I kept reminding myself that a lot of the damage that occurs in <br/>\nschool is because kids are there against their will.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo months went by, and by the time testing came around in the spring, the fun <br/>\nstarted to drain away and the teacher&#39;s perky smile began to fade, and he&#39;d <br/>\ncome home complaining more often.  Once she threw away a piece of origami he <br/>\nwas working on (when he was supposed to be doing something &quot;productive,&quot; she <br/>\nsaid) and he came home in tears.  I responded by &quot;helpfully&quot; emailing her a pile <br/>\nof articles on the educational value of origami, and he felt better.<br/>\n <br/>\nThen in June he started thinking he didn&#39;t want to go to 6th grade.  He <br/>\nwished he could just skip it and go to 7th, because he really wanted to know what <br/>\njunior high was like.  Well, since I had placed him low, he really was just old <br/>\nenough to go to 7th, so I started making phone calls.  Apparently it&#39;s not <br/>\nsomething they do, except in &quot;really rare circumstances&quot; but I somehow managed <br/>\nto convince them how rare our circumstances really were, reminding them that <br/>\nhe&#39;d never opened a textbook before 5th grade, so why wouldn&#39;t he be able to <br/>\njust walk into 7th the same way?  His grades were good, but certainly not enough <br/>\nto warrant acceleration to 7th grade.  Ultimately I think it was because they <br/>\nknew I was willing to pull him out and put him in &quot;private school&quot; at home and <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t want to lose money, so the principal and the teacher signed off <br/>\non it.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd then in the fall, after less than two weeks of junior high, he quit.  WAY <br/>\ntoo much homework, and the teachers were strict and disrespectful toward the <br/>\nkids, and it was much harder to make friends with all that class switching and <br/>\nno real recess.  At first I found a part of myself wishing he&#39;d stay, to <br/>\n*prove* he could do it since I&#39;d made the effort to get him there, then I realized <br/>\nthat was nuts and I was completely losing sight of the original goal.  (And <br/>\nfortunately, dh agreed.)<br/>\n <br/>\nSo now he&#39;s home and happy, and *knows* for himself that unschooling is <br/>\ndefinitely better.

(that is, with <br/>\nrespect and understanding) She&#39;s been really lucky and all but one of <br/>\nher teachers are confident enough in themselves to treat the kids with <br/>\nrespect. The hardest part for me is dealing with &quot;problems&quot; like just <br/>\nlast week when she was told by the principal that she couldn&#39;t come <br/>\nback until she changed her hair color to something &quot;normal&quot; (she had <br/>\nblue tips on her blonde hair as part of her halloween costume, but she <br/>\nliked enough that we did it with the semi permanent dye) So her and I <br/>\ndiscussed it and I told her I would talk to the principal for her if <br/>\nshe wanted because no where in the dress code did it say that kids <br/>\ncan&#39;t have blue or any other color hair, or she could just stay home, <br/>\nor we could change it. In the end she decided she&#39;d rather just change <br/>\nit and so we made the tips white with white highlights and it looks <br/>\nnice. The hardest part for me is feeling so protective, I&#39;m ready to <br/>\njump any of the school establishment as soon as I feel they are <br/>\ninfringing on her rights. The hardest part for her is getting up in the <br/>\nmorning and I think that might be the reason she decides to stop and <br/>\ncome back home.

SO far this hasn&#39;t been a problem <br/>\nwith the school, but I&#39;m not sure how many days she can miss before <br/>\nthey start calling me and sending letters etc. Even then, she probably <br/>\nwont care about it, it will be myself and my own anxiety.

One principal told me I could visit but not her, as<br/>\nshe might &quot;see art on the walls and want that classroom and be disappointed<br/>\nif she didn&#39;t get it.&quot;  I said &quot;She&#39;s the one in charge of her education,<br/>\nwhy would I be the only one visiting?&quot;  Anyway, finally a school worked out<br/>\nand she went for the day.  It was a private school with four recesses,<br/>\ncatered lunch, ice cream snack after school - I fretted all day knowing she<br/>\nwould be nuts over it.  She came home and said she didn&#39;t want to go back -<br/>\nbecause she didn&#39;t want to get up early.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time it seems different though.  She started making noise about it when<br/>\nwe moved in July, and I know a big part of it is her having left all of her<br/>\nfriends.  We also had a very traumatic pet loss that is still bringing us<br/>\ngrief, which I&#39;m sure is a factor.  I&#39;m working hard on connecting down here<br/>\nand making new friends, but you know it sometimes takes time to find the<br/>\nright fit, especially when they are thinking of the friends left behind.<br/>\nBut also, she wants &quot;lessons.&quot;  She wants me to assign her lessons with<br/>\nhomework - we have never done any lessons as we&#39;ve always unschooled, and I<br/>\nthink she wants to see what it&#39;s like.  So of course I will accommodate<br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she just wants to see what it&#39;s like, but I also worry that she will<br/>\nwant to continue.  My husband is ambivalent about homeschooling; he<br/>\nrecognizes its advantages but also thinks school has advantages.  It&#39;s<br/>\nironic because he didn&#39;t finish college, was an entrepreneur, thinks outside<br/>\nthe box, and is very successful.  I&#39;m sure my daughter has picked up his<br/>\nvibes and it undermines my homeschooling/unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut also, I can tell that she would fit in really well at school - she makes<br/>\nfriends very easily, is a leader, I can totally see her thriving.  It feels<br/>\nselfish of me but I&#39;m anticipating/hoping that her natural tendency to<br/>\nmaster something quickly and then get bored easily, will manifest in school.<br/>\nShe also doesn&#39;t like to be told what to do (and rightly so), so I do think<br/>\nthat aspect of school will get old soon.  I tell myself that if it does come<br/>\ndown to it, there are two-three charters around here that enable kids to go<br/>\nto school 2 days a week while homeschooling the rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you had kids who were curious and/or really wanted to go to<br/>\nschool?  How did you handle your personal feelings about institutionalized<br/>\nlearning while respecting their need to experience these things themselves?<br/>\nI am trying to not take it personally (feel rejected and/or that I &quot;failed&quot;<br/>\nin unschooling her) and see it as simply her curiosity and her path to walk,<br/>\nbut it&#39;s difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.503 / Virus Database: 269.15.13/1099 - Release Date: 10/30/2007<br/>\n10:06 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27457,"nextTopicId":27463}}
