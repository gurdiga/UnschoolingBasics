Why pay for him to be unhappy? If<br/>\n&gt;&gt; you need to look at it in terms of cost then continuing to pay the tuition then<br/>\n&gt;&gt; consider it paying for him to be happy. Money aside the important thing is that<br/>\n&gt;&gt; your son feel happy, loved, and respected. He is not getting that at school. It<br/>\n&gt;&gt; also breaks his trust in you as his parent to agree to keep sending him some<br/>\n&gt;&gt; place he isn&#39;t happy. It means to him that his feelings do not matter as much as<br/>\n&gt;&gt; the money that is being spent on him being in what sounds like a horrible place.Wow, Tammy, you&#39;ve said it all -- thanks for pointing all these important things out!I will show this to my husband, and I&#39;m sure he will agree to pull ds out of school.Thanks for taking the time to read through my posts and offer your advice -- I really appreciate it!Shelley<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39185,"nextTopicId":39199}}
