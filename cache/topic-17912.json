Which is the point people are  <br/>\ntrying to make. Not necessarily to you, but to all who are reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can call what we do with our kids teaching or learning or  <br/>\ninfluencing or glorping. It doesn&#39;t change what we do ... and yet   <br/>\nwhen we keep learning and influencing in the teaching box we don&#39;t  <br/>\nget to see how they&#39;re profoundly different! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching is about *pushing* what the teacher thinks is important into  <br/>\na person.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning is about a person *pulling* what interests them in and  <br/>\nmaking sense of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nInfluencing is about living and being and letting another person pull  <br/>\nin what they want and ignore what they don&#39;t want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I believe that children learn how to become individuals through  <br/>\n&gt; their parent(s).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know that unschooling parents create an environment where children  <br/>\nare allowed to blossom as the individuals they already are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Teaching my own children is the greatest gift. I believe that  <br/>\n&gt; children are influenced greatly by their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter has learned tons from me. And from her father. And other  <br/>\npeople and places too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am probably the biggest influence on her. But I think for people  <br/>\ntrying to understand unschooling rather than seeing parents as the  <br/>\nsource of what children learn, it&#39;s more helpful to see the child  <br/>\npulling in the world that interests them. *Part* of that, a pretty  <br/>\nbig part, is what I do and say. *Part* of that is what I expose her  <br/>\nto. And that&#39;s awesome and a big responsibility. BUT, to really,  <br/>\ndeeply understand unschooling it&#39;s important to see that our kids  <br/>\nwill be learning from *everything* they turn to, especially their  <br/>\ninterests: us, Spongebob Squarepants, mud, Rob Zombie, Google, Art  <br/>\nTrading Cards, Pokemon, rocks, plastic dinosaurs, elevators, Shirley  <br/>\nTemple, bread baking, iPods, role playing games, Photoshop, Coke and  <br/>\nMentos, YouTube.com ....<br/>\n<br/>\nThey take it in. They process it. They make sense of it. They use it.  <br/>\nValuing that part of the learning process is what makes unschooling  <br/>\nunique.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do not judge others even after I get to know them.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think judging has gotten a bad rep! Judge gets equated with  <br/>\njudgmental: &quot;having or displaying an excessively critical point of  <br/>\nview.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat *isn&#39;t* what anyone&#39;s doing here. But we each are, individually,  <br/>\nfor ourselves, weighing and thinking about and judging *ideas* -- not  <br/>\njudging people! ideas!-- deciding what is good for us and what is bad  <br/>\nfor us. That&#39;s a *good* thing!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou had to judge that the idea of homeschooling or unschooling was  <br/>\nbetter than school in order to decide to do it! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do feel like I am my children&#39;s teacher as I have taught them all  <br/>\n&gt; the things they can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Think of this as directed at the idea you presented rather than at  <br/>\nyou. The words are directed to anyone who is thinking about that idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it helps people understand unschooling to see that we help  <br/>\nour kids a lot but that our kids are doing the important part:  <br/>\nfiguring out and making connections and learning. We&#39;re there to  <br/>\npresent ideas. They take them in and make sense of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut regardless of how much influence we have, the majority of the  <br/>\nwork of learning goes on inside of the child. *That&#39;s* the important  <br/>\ndistinction between traditional views of learning and unschooling.  <br/>\nTraditionally the focus is on what&#39;s outside and the tricks to get it  <br/>\ninside a child. It helps unschoolers a lot to see that while the  <br/>\nparents create the environment -- including us, our willingness to  <br/>\nhelp, our willingness to share what we feel is important -- the child  <br/>\ndoes whatever is meaningful for the child with what we give them  <br/>\naccess to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can create an environment that encourages walking, but we can&#39;t  <br/>\nteach a child to walk. We can call creating the environment and  <br/>\nspeaking words of encouragement teaching, but we&#39;re missing the  <br/>\nfundamental part of the learning that unschooling focuses on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can create an environment for learning to ride a bike, encourage  <br/>\nthem, tell them balance and safety tips, buy them a helmet, make sure  <br/>\nthey have a safe place to learn but you could package all that up and  <br/>\nhand it to a child and they wouldn&#39;t know how to ride. All the  <br/>\nlearning happens inside. It&#39;s about feeling and noticing and making  <br/>\nmistakes and getting physical feedback from what you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s  <br/>\nthe important part of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Such as: using the bathroom on their own, how to make bread , how  <br/>\n&gt; to be a good listener to their friends and family, how to speak  <br/>\n&gt; properly to adults using yes ma&#39;m and/or sir. I always have  <br/>\n&gt; compliments on how well behaved my children are.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And school teachers would have a very similar description of what  <br/>\nthey do with their students.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we try to use the image of what teachers do in order to  <br/>\nunschool ... well, it stymies most new to unschooling. All of us  <br/>\nalready know how to teach. We may not do it well, but we thoroughly  <br/>\nunderstand the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe image of being a child&#39;s teacher doesn&#39;t help parents understand  <br/>\nhow to unschool. We need different images, different ways of seeing  <br/>\nhow children learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s what people here help others get: we present images, new  <br/>\nways of thinking. But the task of actually learning happens inside of  <br/>\nthe reader. Some may pull the sense of unschooling from the first few  <br/>\nposts they read and *get* unschooling. For others it may take many  <br/>\nmany posts to slowly form a new image that they really deeply  <br/>\nunderstand. For others, it may take the words of a particular person.  <br/>\nBut none of us here can teach anyone how to unschool. All we can do  <br/>\nis present words that make sense to us. The readers have to do the  <br/>\nwork of making their own sense out of it, eg, learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":233219230,"authorName":"Homeschlfor2@aol.com","from":"Homeschlfor2@...","profile":"chrissysspoiled","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Where do I find a certified teacher to","postDate":"1160188098","msgId":17939,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1My5mMjAyMDBlLjMyNTg2YWMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17927,"nextInTopic":17944,"prevInTime":17938,"nextInTime":17940,"topicId":17912,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/6/2006 4:57:39 PM Central Daylight Time, kbcdlovejo@aol.com writes: My  children live life to learn. -=-=-=-=- Maybe they need to learn","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1104366353\">In a message dated 10/6/2006 4:57:39 PM Central Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy  children live life to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they need to learn  to live life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow this is huge to me  im not sure why this jumps out at me  but  seeing <br/>\nthese 2 sentences like this is just...........

Ren has given careful consideration to the unschooling <br/>\n  philosophy, knows it and lives it. She and other unschoolers have taken <br/>\n  the time to think about what it means to be an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Today maybe you should teach your kids about punctuation. You have ninety <br/>\n  eight words in that sentence. Maybe your kids will learn about writing <br/>\n  from reading good books. I&#39;m teasing you a little. I don&#39;t honestly care <br/>\n  much about how people write. I&#39;m not famous for spelling or grammar or <br/>\n  punctuation and will likely never be interested enough to attempt to impress <br/>\n  anyone.
