My daughter doesn&#39;t like to be read to - and yet she&#39;s watched a number of &quot;classics&quot; via tv and movies and knows of many others via common references. One of the basic principles of unschooling is that learning derives from that which is meaningful. Reading &quot;classical literature&quot; to a child who is disinterested won&#39;t be a terribly meaningful endeavor. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  These classics are inspiring and an<br/>\n&gt; education in and of themselves<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t about getting an education, though. At its most basic it is a matter of seeing that learning is such a natural human drive that parents have no need to regulate What children learn. Unschooling kids can learn everything they need Without pushing &quot;classics&quot; on them - yes, they can even learn to recognize references to classical literature and art from other sources, and some of them will pursue that and read &quot;the classics&quot; for themselves. If they want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is much more interested in visual art than literature. She enjoys art museums and galleries and has a few favored artists - none of them &quot;classical&quot; at this point, though. She knows more about classical animation, like Tom and Jerry ;) It has been fascinating to me to see her really dive in to animation as an art form, study different ways of depicting characters, movement, emotion; different uses of line and color. The way she approaches animation is very very like a classical art education - which isn&#39;t to say all kids will do that, but that one doesn&#39;t need to be guided to specific materials in order to develop a body of knowledge and a strong understanding of a field. You don&#39;t Need to offer kids &quot;classics&quot; for that to happen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so one never has to wonder whether the child<br/>\n&gt; is learning &#39;enough.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Right, a curriculum is a tool to reassure parents ;) It doesn&#39;t actually assure kids are learning what the parents think they are or want them to, though. That&#39;s another basic principle of unschooling - that teaching is not the source of learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling....

Or a <br/>\npoint where the person working to mould the life of another fails to see how <br/>\nvaluable and engaged that life already is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom loved books that she would offer to me as a child that bored me. They <br/>\nwere probably classics in the Thomas Jefferson Education view of the world, but <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t hold a candle to the books that I wanted to read, or the television <br/>\nthat I wanted to watch, or the monkey bars that I wanted to climb. She never <br/>\npressed me to read the books. She would look for others that might appeal and <br/>\noffer those. But if she had, if she had pushed her childhood joys on my <br/>\nuninterested child self what would either of us have gained? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is little harm to be had in offering something, unless, of course, your <br/>\noffers have already been shown to be demands instead of offers. If an offer or a <br/>\nsuggestion is really a required reading event, or whatever, than it is an <br/>\nargument that without whatever it is that person isn&#39;t good enough as they <br/>\nstand. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI offer books to Simon and Linnaea fairly regularly. Simon likes books on his <br/>\nipod. He really likes Orson Scott Card books and I got a Science Fiction review <br/>\nbook so that I could look for other, similar authors. Linnaea and I went to a <br/>\nbookstore recently looking for authors similar to H.P. Lovecraft. The owner was <br/>\nvery helpful and took us around to lots of different books in search of overlap. <br/>\nBoth of those occasions were brought about by Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s own desires <br/>\nand my need/want/desire to accomodate them and their interests. I want to help <br/>\nto further their exploration of the world as they are interested in it. I am not <br/>\nlooking to other people&#39;s image of what a good education is when I am buying <br/>\nEdgar Allen Poe books for Linnaea or buying Dune for Simon. I am looking to <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking to Simon and Linnaea has been going on for much of their lives. When <br/>\nSimon liked Bear in the Big Blue House I got copies of episodes for him as we <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford cable at the time. When Linnaea liked Hannah Montana I offered <br/>\nher Raven as a possible show she might enjoy. When they liked zip swings I got a <br/>\npass to a local museum with a playpark so that we could go play on the zip swing <br/>\nwhenever they wanted to. And I found more places with similar fun things to play <br/>\non. The more I pay attention to what Simon or Linnaea are interested in, the <br/>\nmore I can find other things that might engage them as well. And, as a <br/>\ncorollary, the more that I can see the interest, the value, the joy, the <br/>\nengagement in what they are already doing. I think that a system like Thomas <br/>\nJefferson Education argues that it is only through reading the classics as <br/>\ndefined by their board that a child, or an adult, will truly become a learned <br/>\nperson. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe webpage you mentioned has a section on math. It reads  &quot;Mathematics is an <br/>\nintegral part of a statesman’s education . . . . Math  teaches a person to think <br/>\nin a way that no other field does. As a  person studies math, he learns to:<br/>\n\t1. seek and recognize patterns<br/>\n\t2. explore the relationship between things<br/>\n\t3. see similarities and also distinctions<br/>\n\t4. analyze logically but with a deep sense that there is a right answer and a <br/>\nset ideal worth detecting<br/>\n\t5. compare and contrast<br/>\n\t6. see things in black and white<br/>\n\t7. see infinite shades of grey and therefore avoid jumping to conclusions<br/>\n\t8. seek evidence for conclusions and check opinion with first-hand research<br/>\n\t9. put his own pen to paper before accepting what society tells him<br/>\n\t10. seek for absolutes<br/>\n\t11. remain open to surprising new information which makes past conclusions <br/>\nlimited though perhaps still accurate--------<br/>\nI would argue that living an engaged and an enriched life do most of those <br/>\nthings without looking to a specific subject to frame them. I would also argue <br/>\nthat the stated end goal of being able to think like an Archimedes, a Newton or <br/>\nan Einstein is not recognising that people are different. How frustrated would I <br/>\nbe thinking that if I read the list of books at the end of it I would be able to <br/>\nthink like Archimedes and Newton and Einstein? I&#39;m guessing that each of them <br/>\ncould think rings around me, maybe within certain contexts as opposed to all of <br/>\nlife ;-). It seems like a sales pitch kind of argument: buy our system, read our <br/>\nbooks and think like Archimedes or Newton or Einstein.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon&#39;s ability to seek and recognize a pattern has been honed not by reading <br/>\nabout math but by playing video games, and, by not reading early. Simon could <br/>\nfind the most relevant piece of any scene in a video game long before Linnaea or <br/>\nI could. We were reading the text offered while he was reading the setting. And <br/>\nthat applies out to the rest of the world. He sees things when we are camping, <br/>\nhe sees things in relationships, he makes connections without ever having read <br/>\nPlato or Euler or Descartes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list of what someone learns kind of fades off at the end. You see things in <br/>\nblack and white and shades of grey. You seek absolutes and recognise that <br/>\nnothing is absolute necessarily.... I suppose those things aren&#39;t really <br/>\ncontradictions, but they read a bit like a list that someone is hoping will <br/>\nspark with other people rather than a list of well thought out outcomes from a <br/>\nrich education. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think in outcomes. My life with Simon and Linnaea is not outcome based. <br/>\nI could very quickly derive from their day to day experiences and explorations <br/>\nand engagements a post hoc educational plan to present to whomever I needed to <br/>\npresent it to. Because I&#39;m paying attention to who they are and what they do I <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to use someone else&#39;s approach to how to educate a child to make <br/>\nSimon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s education look good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want outcomes to aspire to, I quite like this one: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/connections/cocktail.\">http://sandradodd.com/connections/cocktail.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jill Finkenbine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:peace.goodwill@...\">peace.goodwill@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 8 September, 2011 22:38:59<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling....

In some places you get around many of the homeschool laws by joining an &quot;umbrella school&quot; which is essentially a private school - and therefore not regulated the same ways as public or home schools And as such not listed under &quot;state home school legislation&quot; on official state sites. Generally speaking, so long as you live somewhere homeschooling is legal (and in the US it is in all states) there are ways to manage local legislation without disrupting your unschooling life. It may be a matter of finding someone who is &quot;unschooling friendly&quot; to review a portfolio or it may be a matter of having kids take a standardized test once a year (some places require a test by have No requirements regarding the results so you can &quot;file and forget&quot;).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I love to just let him go, be joyful in life, do what he wants....help him, when needed, if needed....but then that &quot;little voice&quot; comes in and says &quot;CURRICULUM&quot; !!!!  or &quot;HE CAN&#39;T POSSIBLY BE LEARNING BY DOING NOTHING&quot;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s normal to have those kinds of worries, especially at first. Part of the problem is that school makes learning seem like sooooo much work! and yet the very processes schools use are massively time and labor wasting. How much do you Really remember from your dozen years of educations? Most people recall very very little they learned in school - isn&#39;t that a common complaint of teachers? ;) And the experiences of unschoolers who choose to try high school or go to college bear that out - it takes embarrassingly (for schools) little time to &quot;catch up&quot; on more than a decade of &quot;education&quot;. I&#39;m talking weeks to months! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson went through the mill with home school and then public school and finally unschooling. When he first heard of &quot;Learn Nothing Day&quot; (a tongue-in-cheek unschooling &quot;holiday&quot;) he commented that the Only way to learn nothing for a whole day was to go to school! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help you to learn more about learning - real learning rather than schoolish learning. Unschooling rarely looks like schoolish learning.

Right now, you&#39;re seeing schoolish learning, but that&#39;s okay for the moment ;) Use those &quot;gains&quot; to reassure you he&#39;s learning other things, things you don&#39;t think to look for because school has left you with blinders around the idea of &quot;learning&quot;. Generally its much harder and longer for parents to &quot;deschool&quot; than for kids - we have more years of school and schoolish thinking to get over than they do. Put that curriculum high on a shelf where it won&#39;t stare at you all day and spend that time living and playing and learning effortlessly all day long.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to Unschooling....
