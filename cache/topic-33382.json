The woman (&quot;expert&quot;) who ran the <br/>\nclinic labeled my 1yo as &quot;gifted.&quot;  I hated that!  I hadn&#39;t even <br/>\nheard of unschooling then. I&#39;m sure she would say he&#39;s on some sort <br/>\nof &quot;spectrum&quot; now. I know he would hate school. He doesn&#39;t like to do <br/>\nanything anyone else is telling him he has to do, he tends to get <br/>\ntotally engrossed in an activity and keep with it much longer than <br/>\nI&#39;ve heard is &quot;normal&quot; for most kids, he&#39;s *very* energetic, <br/>\nemotional and strong-willed. I came to find that the woman at the <br/>\nclinic had a lot of stress, was not dealing with it well, was very <br/>\njudgemental and gossipy of her clients, and had a hard time keeping <br/>\nemployees. <br/>\n<br/>\nI recently enrolled ds in a couple of &quot;fun&quot; activities (Gymboree and <br/>\nLittle Gym), because we just moved and I thought it would be a good <br/>\nway to meet kids and moms (we moved to Geneva, Switzerland where <br/>\nthere are almost no homeschoolers, much less unschoolers). But now I <br/>\ncan&#39;t wait for our membership to be over, because my son refuses to <br/>\nparticipate in the group, which leads the instructors to degrade him <br/>\n(either in actual words or just with their attitudes). We don&#39;t even <br/>\ngo half the time anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe point that I&#39;m getting to is that living life with how your kids <br/>\nare and appreciating how they are will support them more than <br/>\nanything an &quot;expert&quot; can say. You and your kids are the experts! I <br/>\nthink experts can offer a lot of good ideas, but I&#39;d say follow your <br/>\nown sense of what works for your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of people tell me I need to think of myself, too, as an <br/>\nargument to put ds in school and do things I like during the day. I <br/>\nthink I need some more time to decompress, too. I figure I&#39;ll just <br/>\ntake the money we&#39;d spend on school and similar activities and hire a <br/>\nbabysitter who can appreciate my style of parenting/education.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea for you if you also feel the need to stress less may be <br/>\nto coordinate with other families -- your kids go over to their <br/>\nhouse, then their kids visit you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope I haven&#39;t blabbed too much. I know there are a lot of people <br/>\nhere supporting that you let go of the &quot;experts.&quot; I&#39;m another one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJolene  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Melissa Gray <br/>\n&lt;autismhelp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hey,<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m unschooling several on the spectrum.

For example, he can&#39;t go on the slide or the jungle gym because  <br/>\nthe district policy is that no child with a seizure disorder is  <br/>\nallowed to go &quot;up&quot; on any playground equipment.&quot;  Anyway, there was  <br/>\nmore of the same - my sister explaining to the mom the restrictions of  <br/>\nbeing in a public school program.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day the mom decided not to enroll the child after all. The  <br/>\nprincipal said something about it to my sister - about it being &quot;too  <br/>\nbad.&quot; My sister said, &quot;No, it was probably the best thing. With his  <br/>\nmom, he &#39;CAN&#39; do all kinds of things he couldn&#39;t do here.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t being sarcastic, she meant it. She doesn&#39;t think the public  <br/>\nschool classroom is the best thing for all kids, but she does believe  <br/>\nthat many parents simply cannot cope well with the many severe  <br/>\ndisabilities their children have. Also, what both of my sisters (both  <br/>\nspecial ed teachers) see is a lot of parents who do NOT at all support  <br/>\ntheir kids in meeting challenges - don&#39;t allow their kids to take any  <br/>\nrisks, etc. Their kids get far more freedom to be themselves in the  <br/>\nclassroom than they do at home, where they may be well cared for (or  <br/>\nnot), but they aren&#39;t supported much in DOING things for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 2, 2008, at 8:10 AM, olearydeborah wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I give you a resounding, YES!

I am new to unschooling too so I might not be able to give you advise as<br/>\na veteran but I do have an almost 6 year old child with PDD-nos. He was in<br/>\nearly intervention (5-8 hours of school a day) and then last year we<br/>\nhomeschooled him through the school district&#39;s homebased program. Early<br/>\nintervention was good for him up until a point and it really depended on the<br/>\nprogram. At some point I realized that they couldn&#39;t provide him with what<br/>\nhe needed. School was stressing him out and making things really hard for<br/>\nhim. Homeschooling him has been the best choice for him. We can choose the<br/>\nsocial situations that will give him a chance to play with other kids in<br/>\nsmaller groups. He has also gotten incredibly close with his sister who is<br/>\n4. The &quot;socialization&quot; that he has gotten from playing with her all day is<br/>\nirreplaceable. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided to look into unschooling because my son seems to be happier<br/>\nand learn more when he is initiating the subject of study (he taught himself<br/>\nhow to read). The school district was big on worksheets and it ended in<br/>\narguments most mornings which affects his stress level and our relationship.<br/>\nMostly though,  being out of school in general has affected his stress<br/>\nlevels in such a positive way. He has progressed some much that in most ways<br/>\nhe is indistinguishable from his peers. I am hoping that unschooling takes<br/>\nit to a whole new level.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI too have gotten a lot of &quot;huh?&quot; when I have said we are pulling him out of<br/>\nschool. I know a lot of parents think I am crazy and a lot of teachers<br/>\nreally (At least initially) think he needs to be in school to learn social<br/>\nskills. Now, after homeschooling for a year they are seeing his progress and<br/>\nacknowledging that we made the right choice for him. Mainly the support that<br/>\nthey are giving children at school is trying to help them survive IN<br/>\nSCHOOL..not in the world. I believe that services are imperative for<br/>\nchildren that have no choice but to be in school. If one can be at home with<br/>\na child on the spectrum, I think it can make a bigger impact on progression<br/>\nbut it requires a lot of attention, giving them opportunities to learn, etc<br/>\n(obviously!). I personally don&#39;t think that exposure to large groups of<br/>\nchildren is what kids on the spectrum need. I think they need a comfortable<br/>\nand non stressful  ways to socialize at their own pace and usually in very<br/>\nsmall groups (1:1 at least initially). School usually doesn&#39;t supply that<br/>\nopportunity. Plus they can really choose the ways they want to socialize<br/>\n(nature groups, lessons, playdates, sports, clubs, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli Johnston<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of morrisfamilyfive<br/>\nSent: Monday, June 02, 2008 6:03 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] unschooling with autism, adhd, dysgraphia<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHi all.

I attempted to homeschool our 10 1/2 <br/>\nand 5 1/2 year old for the last two years with high levels of <br/>\nstress.  Our 10 1/2 year old has PDD-NOS, ADHD, sensory issues (chews <br/>\nhis t-shirt collar, withold&#39;s stool and soils).  Anyway, he probably <br/>\nis developmentally age 7.  Very bright, remembers so much from his <br/>\nearly years.  Wants to do and learn on his own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 5 1/2 year old what has high functioning autism, ADHD, and <br/>\ndysgraphia.  He went to preschool one year and I pulled him out.  I <br/>\nfelt like his spirit was being suffocated through all red tape that <br/>\nis associated with public school.  He is very active but also very <br/>\nbright and attentive to what he wants to learn.  He knows all shapes, <br/>\ncolors, numbers (counts to 100), letters, recognizes some words and <br/>\nloves for me to read with him.  Knows some spanish words and knows <br/>\nhow to count in spanish.  This is something that his Mom does not <br/>\nknow.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 2 1/2 year old was recently diagnosed high functioning autism.  <br/>\nHe too is very bright.
