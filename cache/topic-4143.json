","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1050746786\">&quot;Problem is, that&#39;s the<br/>\ntheory. In practice she chooses to spend her time reading or being on<br/>\nthe pc etc rather than doing the bit she has agreed to do. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a lot of stress to me.<br/>\nSounds like she isn&#39;t &quot;choosing&quot; the chores at all, but saying what <br/>\nMom wants to hear. You won&#39;t get total honesty (she probably hates <br/>\nchores) until you relax.<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, because everyone imagines in a house of freedom, that <br/>\nthe kids are just ignoring the Parents needs and making messes <br/>\neverywhere...that isn&#39;t the truth.<br/>\nMy kids have different priorities than I do, if I saw their lack of <br/>\nhelp as robbing MY freedom and time, then I would resent it more.<br/>\nIf I see their messes as them being busy with their interests and <br/>\nmore involved with other things than house cleaning (good for them) <br/>\nit changes my attitude and I can ask for help without a bunch of <br/>\nbaggage attached.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the food restrictions, it sounds like your child has zero self <br/>\ncontrol...that&#39;s caused by controlling their food intake for them. <br/>\nIt will take a long time for her to begin listening to her body <br/>\nagain and make true choices rather than act out of neediness or lack.<br/>\nIf she&#39;s wanting you to control it again, that&#39;s a sign of someone <br/>\nunable to make their own decisions. Better she re-learn how to make <br/>\nher own food choices now, rather than as an adult.<br/>\nInstead of leaving her to fend for herself (scary when someone has <br/>\nbeen controlling you) why don&#39;t you try saying &quot;yes&quot; more and more?<br/>\nEventually, she will be making her own food choices and not feeling <br/>\nso needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3885,"nextTopicId":4081}}
