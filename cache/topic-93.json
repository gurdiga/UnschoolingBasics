This email will automatically go to new members <br/>\nfrom here on, but I wanted to post it for those of you that already <br/>\njoined before I got organized.:) Thanks for bearing with me on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nDear new member,<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the unschoolingbasics list. We look forward to sharing <br/>\ninformation and ideas with you, but first, we ask you to look over <br/>\nour posting and list guidelines:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) No discussions will be allowed about posts. This is called <br/>\na &quot;meta-discussion&quot; (discussing the discussion) and posts analyzing <br/>\nanother person&#39;s message or posting style will be deleted. If there <br/>\nis something about a post that bothers you, stick to discussing the <br/>\nideas presented, rather than the post itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Please only post issues/topics that you are open to discussing. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s in your message, it&#39;s open to discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Try to change the subject line if the topic changes. This will <br/>\nhelp us all access archives and utilize the discussions more <br/>\neffectively. Also, trim your posts to avoid a message that takes up <br/>\ntoo much room. It&#39;s difficult to read through them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) All new members will be moderated in order to prevent spam from <br/>\nreaching the list. Once you post an intro. or question, we will <br/>\nremove you from moderation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you visit the actual site, we are adding information and <br/>\nresources under the &quot;links&quot; section. Book recommendations, blogs and <br/>\nwebsites will be linked for you to access.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to upload pictures of yourself and family at the &quot;photos&quot; <br/>\nsection if you wish. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to have a visual of the <br/>\nfolks we talk with daily.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing:<br/>\nIf you have questions, problems, comments or compliments (yeah, we <br/>\nlove those:), please feel free to write the list owners~ Kelly <br/>\nLovejoy or Ren Allen, or the moderators~ Rue Kream or Deb Lewis. If <br/>\nyou send an email to &quot;list owners&quot; we will all receive it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo welcome! Let&#39;s get talking....<br/>\n<br/>\nRen and Kelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":71,"nextTopicId":7}}
