They are trying to get their fill before you change your mind or<br/>\nthey&#39;re gone. Most people will gorge on anything they love that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t have access to when they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re angry because they&#39;re acting like normal human beings. If you<br/>\nwant them to have access to healthier snacks, make them more readily<br/>\navailable. What if you&#39;d made up a platter of the gummis and a bunch<br/>\nof other yummy finger foods? Kids shouldn&#39;t be expected to wait for<br/>\nchicken and rice when they&#39;re hungry NOW. Food should be readily<br/>\navailable all day so they can learn to balance their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gummis would probably disappear first because it&#39;s a desirable<br/>\nfood that isn&#39;t available often (it sounds like). But eventually, as<br/>\nthey trust you to give them access to the foods they choose, it will<br/>\nslow down. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I am so<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fed up at them wanting sugar and feeling stuck between my ineptitude<br/>\n&gt; and my ideal of unschooling food .~~<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve created a reality in which they believe those foods are more<br/>\ndesirable than others. If you don&#39;t have the budget for a lot of<br/>\nprocessed foods, you could make the snacks available by baking more of<br/>\nwhat they love. Make food available. Make it yummy. Involve the kids<br/>\nin food prep and they may come up with some great ideas.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSome words in your post jumped out at me:<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel powerless<br/>\nI feel so inept at cooking<br/>\nI&#39;m angry<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m getting from this is a frustration about life in general and<br/>\nit seems like the kids making some choices you are used to controlling<br/>\nis some kind of trigger. Is that possible? Could it be that you&#39;re<br/>\nalready feeling overwhelmed and out of control and the fact that they<br/>\naren&#39;t happily asking for broccoli for every meal is making<br/>\nexascerbating your frustrations?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can only BE exactly where they are right now. Same with you. If<br/>\nfrustration over not being able to afford better/more food is<br/>\ntrickling into frustration towards them (for simply being themselves)<br/>\nthen it&#39;s time to self-examine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may not be about food at all. This could be a control issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your budget is so tight that you will truly be out of food until<br/>\nmore money comes, then you will have to be really honest with them<br/>\nabout what you can and can&#39;t afford. Let them be part of the solution<br/>\nbut don&#39;t make them feel responsible for the money issues, or for<br/>\neating the gummis too fast. They SHOULD eat them fast if they aren&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to get more for a while!<br/>\n<br/>\nFind their favorite treats, make sure you focus on making as much from<br/>\nscratch to save money (or find a way to make more money) and dont&#39;<br/>\nmake anything limited or controlled. Money limits are natural, Mom<br/>\nsaying &quot;no&quot; is arbitrary. <br/>\n<br/>\nOwning your issues is a great way to keep your frustrations from<br/>\nspilling over to your children.

While we were there, I was telling<br/>\nher that on Monday nights, we usually eat dinner in front of the TV<br/>\nand watch some really great shows on CBS. I told her it took me a<br/>\nlittle while to let go of the false guilt I had about that - you hear<br/>\nabout eating dinner in front of the TV like it&#39;s some kind of horrid<br/>\ncrime. But when I really looked at *our* reality, I saw that we<br/>\nchatted about the shows, laughed together a lot - it is a connecting<br/>\ntime, and a lot of fun. (How *did* Ted Moseby meet his kids&#39; mother?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had forgotten, but she reminded me - before my parents were<br/>\ndivorced, we had dinner together every single night. But, because my<br/>\nfather didn&#39;t like chattering going on while he ate, we couldn&#39;t talk!<br/>\nThere was a RULE against talking at the dinner table, unless you were<br/>\nasking someone to pass something. Oh, my gosh - we laughed SO hard at<br/>\nthat absurdity! I could remember we developed this whole communication<br/>\nsystem of looks and eye movements... <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were saying I bet there are some families who&#39;ve heard those<br/>\ncommercials about how important it is to eat dinner together as a<br/>\nfamily, at the table, who&#39;ve made the experience just as miserable as<br/>\nit was for us. (You sit down and eat your dinner! This is family time,<br/>\ndammit!!)

First, let me say I do all the cooking and the<br/>\nwashing up.  It&#39;s easy to get miffed when I spend 3 hours making<br/>\nsomething that only one person will eat.  It&#39;s also easy to get ticked<br/>\nat the idea that I have to spend 3 hours making 5 different meals and<br/>\ncleaning them up.  There are lots of reasons for that and they are all<br/>\nINTERNAL.  I have some *issues* related to being &quot;just a mommy&quot; which<br/>\nI need to get a handle on.  But anyway, I&#39;ve been where you are,<br/>\nalthough I didn&#39;t obsess over vitamins.  I&#39;ve also seen my kids blow<br/>\nthrough a box of gummies or whatever in 10 minutes and then have them<br/>\nlament there aren&#39;t more available.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I *could* buy 50 boxes of them but they are expensive and that&#39;s<br/>\nnot in the budget.  So where I can I buy those types of things in<br/>\nbulk.  My boys are 11 and 9 and they don&#39;t need the cute little<br/>\npackages anymore.  When they were younger they liked having Disney<br/>\ncharacters or whatever, but now that they are older, they just want<br/>\nthe gummies so they are cool with just plain old bears.  So consider<br/>\npurchasing things in bulk to make your dollar stretch.  Now for the<br/>\nboys they need clearly demarcated amounts of things or they will<br/>\nfight.  So I buy them and then put them into containers for each kid<br/>\nand they are marked so that if John eats all his, that&#39;s that.  Liam<br/>\nwill still have his and I don&#39;t have the &quot;Yeah but he ate almost ALL<br/>\nof them!!!&quot;  This works.  It also makes it possible for the kids to<br/>\nuse portion control if they so wish.  They are getting more aware of<br/>\nbeing fat/thin healthy/unhealthy and making good choices and so if<br/>\nthey have say 1/2 a pound of gummies we look up what a serving would<br/>\nbe, get them something to measure it out with and then they belong to<br/>\nthem.  If they want to eat 1/2 a lb in 30 minutes that&#39;s their<br/>\nbusiness.  After all, if I want to eat 15 ice creams in one day who<br/>\nwill stop me?  No one.  Once you let go of this area you and your kids<br/>\nwill be happier and you won&#39;t see as much gorging.  But do buy in bulk<br/>\nunless the little packages are important to your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in January I brought home Shun, Xian Yi aka Morgan from Guangzhou<br/>\nChina.  She has a VERY short list of what she considers edible.  And<br/>\nbecause we are bonding and I know a lot about integrating an<br/>\ninternationally adopted child into the family, I knew not to push the<br/>\nfood thing.  Besides, there is a mental shift that happens when you<br/>\nstop thinking &quot;Little brat won&#39;t eat that!&quot;  to &quot;She doesn&#39;t believe<br/>\nthat&#39;s food.&quot;  And there isn&#39;t anything I can do about it.  She eats<br/>\nwhat she eats.  Slowly her list is getting longer but it&#39;s a very slow<br/>\nprocess.  And I was *TOTALLY* OK with it.  Well if it&#39;s OK for this<br/>\nchild why not my kids?  Why was I putting pressure on them to eat?<br/>\nAfter much internal examination all my &quot;yeah but...&quot;s were making room<br/>\nfor *my* issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I&#39;m trying to say, look at the issues you think you have,<br/>\nand then be honest with yourself about whether they are real<br/>\nfamily/kid issues like budget or allergies or if they are your issues<br/>\n(which are just as real only you have to work on them) like feeling<br/>\ntaken for granted or reliving food issues from your childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there, this one isn&#39;t easy in our culture.  Food is often<br/>\nemotionally charged from our families.  I&#39;ve been dedicated to trying<br/>\nto keep food as food and NOT a punisher or a reward.

We bought some gummis,<br/>\nbread, pop tarts, cereal, rice milk, peanut butter crackers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to soccer and had some crackers and gummis. They had bananas<br/>\nand a drink after soccer. Home again and I try to fix some chicken<br/>\nwith rice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids kept going at the gummis. They&#39;re all gone now.   I&#39;m angry<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s gone and the chicken and rice is in the oven. They will<br/>\nlikely snub it for two reasons. It looks &quot;weird&quot; and they&#39;re full from<br/>\nthe snacky foods they had, mostly sugar. I understand kids can be<br/>\nravenous but I&#39;m trying my best here!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey picked out some food, mostly the junky items themselves. I try to<br/>\nprovide meals that they&#39;d like, and try to incorporate vitamins in<br/>\nthem. I put barley grass onto their peanut butter sandwiches! I am so<br/>\nfed up at them wanting sugar and feeling stuck between my ineptitude<br/>\nand my ideal of unschooling food . Finish, enough. I feel powerless<br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t want to control the foods and leave them craving it<br/>\neven more than they already are now. And I most certainly can&#39;t shove<br/>\nvegetables down their throat!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so inept at cooking because we have. divergent needs and I can<br/>\nbarely meet it on top of everything else. I&#39;m angry because I feel<br/>\npowerless and inept, trying to scrounge together meals and not find<br/>\nmyself still hungry at night because of the slim pickings. How can I<br/>\nkeep trying new foods and having them end up in the garbage because of<br/>\nsnubbings? What am I doing wrong here?!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrean<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 3/25/08, diana jenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hahamommy@...\">hahamommy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Mar 25, 2008 at 3:11 PM, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;   Don&#39;t tell kids things they already know.
