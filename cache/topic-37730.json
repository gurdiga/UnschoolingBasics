So much of <br/>\nunschooling has to do with being kinder and more open with our kids. <br/>\nOur partners can see that, and can find themselves wanting a piece of <br/>\nthe action! although they may not always be able to articulate that. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking about mistakes can help, too - with partners *and* kids. It <br/>\nhelps to be able to see inside someone else&#39;s process, as it were, <br/>\neven when (maybe especially when) that process doesn&#39;t produce a <br/>\nperfect result. It makes us all more human, more genuine and <br/>\napproachable. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":217951851,"authorName":"Christie Craigie-Carter","from":"&quot;Christie Craigie-Carter&quot; &lt;craigiecarter@...&gt;","profile":"c3_2323","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"More conversations with dh","postDate":"1231512375","msgId":37730,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNGM0ZDBhMDkwMTA5MDY0Nm0yMDFjY2ZmZWtjMTUyNzczMDU5Y2ViZDVhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37746,"prevInTime":37729,"nextInTime":37731,"topicId":37730,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So last night, I mentioned to my dh how my mother claimed that by not making my kids go to school, they are more likely to have terrible work ethic when they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1971528344\">So last night, I mentioned to my dh how my mother claimed that by not<br/>\n&quot;making&quot; my kids go to school, they are more likely to have terrible work<br/>\nethic when they get older or some such, and it launched into me checking out<br/>\nif he too feels like we&#39;ve been moving in different directions of late.  He<br/>\nexplained the allowance and chore thing to me further.  He started giving a<br/>\nlittle more than a dollar per week (our oldest gets a dollar and 5 cents, 3<br/>\nquarters, 3 dimes) and he made three piggy banks for them: save, give and<br/>\nspend.  He&#39;s also instituted a list of chores that we could use help with,<br/>\nwhich the kids seem to enjoy and he does not seem to want to tie to<br/>\nallowance anymore.  He was upset that I shut down the conversation with the<br/>\ncurt &quot;No&quot; when he brought up tying allowance to chores, and I apologized<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate, the kids seem to be happy with what he has proposed, but I did<br/>\ndo some questioning of &quot;what if so and so doesn&#39;t do x&quot;, etc.  He seems okay<br/>\nwith that.  Then, I got a bit emotional, explaining that I think we are at a<br/>\ncrossroads with our oldest (7), who doesn&#39;t believe to his core that we love<br/>\nhim and respect him, even though we very much do.  Clearly, that indicates<br/>\nto me that *we* need to make some changes.  I explained to him how much I<br/>\nwant it to be so that when he is 17 (or whatever age), and, for example, is<br/>\nthinking about drinking when he goes out, that he can talk to us and make<br/>\narrangements for us to pick him up or what have you.  In short, I want him<br/>\nto feel close enough and loved enough by us that he can be himself, so that<br/>\nthe guiding principle that I&#39;m trying to live by is &quot;does this build upon<br/>\nour relationship or tear it down?&quot; when I interact with him (which I thank<br/>\nyou all for).<br/>\n<br/>\nI acknowledged that I&#39;ve failed miserably a few times recently, but that I&#39;m<br/>\ntrying to be aware and recognize it without beating myself up which only<br/>\nseems to make it worse.  He said he felt better after the conversation, so<br/>\nwe&#39;ll see where this goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37679,"nextTopicId":37748}}
