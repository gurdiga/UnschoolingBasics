We will be having her evaluated once again to try and get to the bottom of what those issues are, but she comes from two mentally ill birth parents.  I know the heart break of having a child leave that the whole family has become attached to, and it&#39;s a pain that I can not even begin to describe.  We also had a child placed with us that was a bad placement, and we were not informed prior about this little boys mental illness issues.  We could not keep him, because he was harming our other children that were much smaller than him.  The system is seriously in trouble.
