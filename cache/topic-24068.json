In the computer room, which we all share, more of the<br/>\nmess is his mail and band stuff.  I am more of a &quot;a place for<br/>\neverything and everything in it&#39;s place&quot; person.

I don&#39;t want to say &quot;no&quot; because of housework<br/>\n(although I do, and much more often than I feel good about).  But my<br/>\ndh gets so grumpy (right now he&#39;s cleaning the counters and griping<br/>\nabout how this should already be done).  I tell him that I do need his<br/>\nhelp around the house if he wants it a certain way, but I need him to<br/>\ndo it without the griping and snide comments.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep working at it.

There&#39;s always the factor of trying to be<br/>\nconsiderate of other people in the house and their need for clean, but<br/>\nat this point, it sounds like he has expectations without taking any<br/>\nresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d make it clear that you are comfortable with the way things are<br/>\n(I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re fine with whatever level of clean/mess the house<br/>\nis right now?) and ask him how he felt if you tried to impose your<br/>\nlevel of comfort on him......rather than just asking for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nEliciting cooperation works much better than coercing...for adults as<br/>\nwell as kids!!:)  We&#39;ve been known to have a 10 minute straightening<br/>\nbinge just before Bleu gets home, just because we know it will be<br/>\nnicer for him. But someone grumping about mess doesn&#39;t inspire me<br/>\nmuch! Asking for help works much better. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs he open to simply communicating when it bothers him and having a<br/>\nquick clean-up party where everyone just pitches in for a few minutes,<br/>\nmaking it a fun thing to do together?  <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Sorry I need to vent about dh and housework -ugh","postDate":"1180195376","msgId":24070,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMxZi4xNzE2OGVjZi4zMzg5YjQzMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24068,"nextInTopic":24076,"prevInTime":24069,"nextInTime":24071,"topicId":24068,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/26/2007 10:55:19 A.M.

Find a space that is just for your husband that can be as  <br/>\norganized as he needs it to be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am one of those people who really needs a high level of organized clean  <br/>\nspace to feel at peace and be able to function at my best.  My husband is  gone <br/>\nnow most of the time and there is just too much for me to keep up  with.  My <br/>\nkids are older so I don&#39;t really have the messy house issue  and I can just <br/>\nclose the door to a bedroom.  However,  I struggle  with keeping up all the <br/>\noutside stuff...watering, moving, half done house  projects.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have two spaces in the house that I keep just like I want.  When I&#39;m  <br/>\nfeeling overwhelmed (like I am today)  I just go into one of those spaces  and <br/>\nenjoy everything in it&#39;s place.  Then I feel able to just hang out with  the kids <br/>\nor maybe do one more &quot;little&quot; thing that I want to get done.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think I&#39;ve seen Ren post about a space like this for her husband.   It <br/>\nmight be worth a try.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77228268,"authorName":"Marla B.","from":"&quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt;","profile":"hilltowner4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Sorry I need to vent about dh and housework -ugh","postDate":"1180191198","msgId":24068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYzOWhrdSs1cnJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24070,"prevInTime":24067,"nextInTime":24069,"topicId":24068,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My dh, who supports a lot of what we do (i.e. unschooling, family bed, extended nursing, etc.) constantly complains about the housework not being done.

I try to remind him that I am busy non-stop all day,<br/>\npicking up, playing with the kids, making meals, etc.  The children<br/>\nare my priority and I do what housework I can (besides constantly<br/>\npicking up (which I don&#39;t mind), I try to focus on the clothes and<br/>\ndishes - not meaning that I necessarily get them done).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne factor, which I&#39;ve pointed out, is that he is never home.  He<br/>\nworks long hours and when he comes home, he just wants to veg (which<br/>\nmeans he jumps on the computer or watches t.v. alone in his room).  He<br/>\nalso is the leader of a nine-piece horn band (meaning he does<br/>\neverything - sets up practices (trying to get 9 people together once a<br/>\nweek), copies cds and dvds, contacts venues, prints out promotional<br/>\nstuff, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my complaint is that he expects me to keep the house clean, but I<br/>\nwant him to realize that the kids are more important than the<br/>\nhousework.
