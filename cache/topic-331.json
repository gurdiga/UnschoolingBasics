Life can be very challenging with two very active <br/>\nboys...but we are having a blast.  I look forward to learning more <br/>\nabout unschooling and basically just striving to provide and <br/>\nenvirionment for growth and contentment in our family.  Thanks for <br/>\nlistening....&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome Wendy!<br/>\nI think you have the right idea about Waldorf. It makes you happy, so YOU play with their ideas, rather than pushing them on your kids.:)<br/>\nI used to be really drawn to the Waldorf ideas, but at some point realized there were some really lame parts to it, and I could recreate the cool parts at home. We never got there...my kids had other ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the paths they&#39;ve led me down are far richer and more interesting than anything I could have thought up with the Waldorf philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":312,"nextTopicId":323}}
