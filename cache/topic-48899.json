learning.  I didn&#39;t go super overboard trying to document everyday and every moment of each day, but I did try to document the things that showed curiosity in action.  Dad and son looking at a spider under a microscope.  I took lots of pictures of field trips to Science Centers, etc. I also kept my own journal documenting different things we discussed, looked up, books read, etc.  I was SO worried the first few years that the state would come in and demand to see my records.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my own piece of mind, I kept myself aware of where my son &#39;should be&#39; had he traveled the schooling way.   If you ever get looking at where the school requirements are, you might be surprised at how low their standards are.  A child age 8-10 could pretty much learn most everything &#39;taught&#39; in school just by playing Runescape.  Learning truly does happen outside of the school system.  My son has been unschooling since age 8.  He is now almost 15 and plans to start college next year.  He is ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t blogged in awhile but here&#39;s on post that may be of help to you.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://balderdashandblokus.blogspot.com/2009/08/is-college-for-unschoolers-even.html\">http://balderdashandblokus.blogspot.com/2009/08/is-college-for-unschoolers-even.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and laughter, <br/>\nAnd good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nVicki<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot;
