Make her get specific because,<br/>\ngenerally, you don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do much of anything really - there are<br/>\nchoices that most people make most of the time and often don&#39;t realize<br/>\nit&#39;s a choice but that doesn&#39;t change that they are indeed choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t even have to eat BUT the consequences are not very nice. You<br/>\ndon&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; work, wash dishes, do laundry, cook dinner, clean<br/>\nbathrooms, ....BUT the consequences might not be what you want, so you<br/>\ndo them. For instance, you don&#39;t have to wash dishes - you can eat out<br/>\nevery meal (or eat only pre made ready to eat foods - for instance,<br/>\ngranola bars for breakfast); you can use paper/plastic plates, bowls,<br/>\ncups, utensils; you can get new dishes every few weeks (whenever you run<br/>\nout); you could even just leave the dishes in the sink for weeks on end;<br/>\nget a dishwasher (either the mechanical kind or the paid housekeeper<br/>\nkind) and probably other options  as well BUT there&#39;s a consequence (or<br/>\ntwo) to the choices - it costs money, uses resources (paper/plastic non<br/>\nrecyclables), perhaps bugs, smell, mess, etc. You might not LIKE doing<br/>\nthe dishes BUT it is a CHOICE to do it (and there are ways to make it<br/>\nless bothersome - I use a dish soap with orange oil because it&#39;s so<br/>\nrefreshing and uplifting, I&#39;ll often light a small candle on the<br/>\nwindowsill by the sink, and maybe put on some music nearby; DH and I<br/>\ntrade back rubs too - if I&#39;m doing the dishes, he stops by and rubs my<br/>\nback while I work and vice versa; sometimes DS will hang out nearby and<br/>\nwe&#39;ll chat - I have fond memories of long conversations with my mom<br/>\nwhile she washed and I dried).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other side of that is that people DO lots of things they don&#39;t like<br/>\n*in order to* reach a goal of their own CHOOSING. I know several<br/>\ntriathletes here at work and one of them chose to learn how to swim in<br/>\norder to compete - imagine going back in your early 30s to learn how to<br/>\nswim after a lifetime of not swimming - it wasn&#39;t necessarily easy or<br/>\nsomething he would have otherwise chosen BUT he had a goal - compete in<br/>\na triathlon just to do it (he had no plans of getting close to winning,<br/>\nhe just wanted to do it for himself). I&#39;m not all that tickled about<br/>\nsticking my fingers to draw blood daily BUT my goal of being as healthy<br/>\nas possible as long as possible, with fewest complications and<br/>\nmedications means that, as a diabetic, I stick my finger and watch my<br/>\nfood intake and get 20-30 minutes of cardio exercise (exercise bike or<br/>\ntreadmill) at least 5 of 7 days per week. No one is making me do that<br/>\n(and I&#39;ve even disagreed with my endocrinologist about taking certain<br/>\nmeds) BUT I *choose* to do what it takes to avoid diabetic complications<br/>\n(loss of sight, kidneys, nerve function in extremities which usually<br/>\nleads to amputations, heart attack, stroke, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
