I didn&#39;t hear from anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it happens we&#39;ve decided to not rent a car for the<br/>\nfirst few days. We&#39;re in a downtown hotel and it was<br/>\nexpensive to park the car. I&#39;ve figured out how to go<br/>\nto the zoo and the science museum by bus. But<br/>\nrestricted mobility means we&#39;ll probably be spending a<br/>\nlot of time by the hotel pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n--- kendrahn79 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi Manisha,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sorry for the delay in responding I&#39;ve been behind<br/>\n&gt; on emails. Have you been contacted by any <br/>\n&gt; other Colorado folks? I live near Denver. I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; belong to any Unschooling groups yet <br/>\n&gt; though, so I&#39;m unsure about any park days they have.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;d like to meet up and put a face <br/>\n&gt; with the name I&#39;d be happy to do that. Our kids are<br/>\n&gt; different ages (mine are 4 & 15 months) <br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;m sure if we find a park to meet at they will<br/>\n&gt; stay entertained:) Well maybe not my 15 <br/>\n&gt; month old who I will likely be chasing after! Anyway<br/>\n&gt; if you&#39;d like to meet or just want some <br/>\n&gt; info about Denver please let me know.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kendrah<br/>\n&gt; (If you pull my name up on the USBasics archives<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ll seem some of my posts to figure out <br/>\n&gt; who I am)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
