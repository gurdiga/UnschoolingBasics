Anti-vaccination philosophies are<br/>\nsometimes difficult to find and anti-vaccinationists are called names<br/>\nin an attempt to discredit their reasoning. One must concede that both<br/>\nsides are biased in their views, however skewed.

If vaccines were safe and effective there would be no issue<br/>\nhere. Anti-vaccination literature only wants to support the truth and<br/>\nhonestly tell the facts as they really are.

Relationships are VERY important and my child&#39;s happiness is more important than having an unhealthy food. I was raised in a way like unschoolers, I chose what I wanted to eat, I could eat ice cream whenever I wanted to, and ate cookies everyday. not only I am still alive :-) that I chose not to eat (that often) any of those. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a baby and I can choose what to offer him because not only he can&#39;t tell me that he doesn&#39;t ask for other things. As you say once they get older and start seeing how other people eat they may want to explore it too. And I know it will be different then because they can ask for it and wants it. For now, he like what I give him and I will keep it as healthy as can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANK you for kindly letting me see it. I guess I don&#39;t have experience with older children yet. Even less with unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I fist looked into unschooling it was about education not parenting, and I really like and I totally believe that children and humans learn best when they have the willing to do so, when is self chosen and they are ready.. It took me 28 years to finally like and understand math, in college I got straight A&#39;s. I did it because I was there for myself, I wanted to be there and I was ready to take in the information.  I will follow my child&#39;s interest and foster his curiosity and I will let him explore because I also believe children learn better by doing things and exploring and not by being lectured with no exploration. Parenting the unschooling  way is something I have to learn about and try to understand it better. I know I had brought conventional parenting thinking to this group but if I was conventional 100% I would send my child to school and I am not, unless he wants to. So please, bear with me, I am really trying to leave my conventional<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthinking and to open to better ways to parenting. (not that easy in some aspects).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- On Tue, 1/26/10, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 3:10 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Jan 26, 2010, at 3:43 PM, Monica Van Stelton wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it is very hard for  me now to think that I would let my children  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to have ice cream every day and all of that..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have real kids to talk about rather than made up kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe made up kids can act in all sorts of wild ways that sounds  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nplausible, but it&#39;s more useful to discuss real kids.

But you *are* imposing your choices. Intent doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat matters to the child is what the actions feel like and say to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhim. You can explain all you want that your intent isn&#39;t to control  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nor impose, but if it feels like control, it&#39;s the same as if you are  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncontrolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know that sugar, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils,  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; food coloring, etc is bad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBad as in will kill you within the hour?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I bought some cookies that I used to eat in Argentina when I was a  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; child and it had, besides all that I mention also beef fat...yuck..  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They taste delicious but is just like eating a crap cake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of those cookies did you have as a kid? I assume you&#39;re  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstill alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this scenario: You control your son&#39;s eating until he  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nleaves home and then he goes wild gorging on all the forbidden foods  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand not only does he like them, he feels guilty, but continues anyway  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause his memories of healthy food are wrapped up in memories of  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you raise your son in an atmosphere of healthy eating (by your  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstandards) with your understandings swirling around in the air. They  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmake him feel good about the food you enjoy providing. But because  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyou want him to be happy, he also feels good about exploring other  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfoods. When he leaves home he may continue to eat as you provided  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause he has warm memories of it. Or he might eat more widely. But  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be unlikely he&#39;d totally reject what you raised him  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwith because it reminds him of a warm loving home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you control his diet for 18 years and he spends the next 50  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\navoiding healthy food will that be better than if he eats fairly  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhealthy (because of meals and what you bring into the home) with some  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s explored thrown in, and then for the rest of his  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlife he continues like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of those two is the most healthy life?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you *want* the scenario to be you provide the right food and  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nright information about food and he continues that for the rest of  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhis life. That&#39;s very very unlikely. If control worked, we&#39;d all be  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nperfect parents and there would be no need for parenting books!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Everyone* is practically born knowing how to impose their will on  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else to get their way. Two year olds do it! Humans as a  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngeneral rule don&#39;t like to learn by being told what&#39;s right and  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwrong. Humans as a general rule like to try things out and find  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your scenario to happen, you&#39;re fighting against human  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nnature and not only likely to be disappointed but will damage your  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If your son is walking on the side walk and sees poo would you let  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; him eat it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe trusts that you won&#39;t let him eat poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t help you think clearer if you&#39;re casting sugar into the same  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbox as poop. Tens of millions of people all over the world are eating  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsugar. Many many of them are living to old age. There are very few  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npeople eating poop. It won&#39;t help your relationship with your son to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsee what he&#39;s eating and enjoying as poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; having it once in a while it won&#39;t do as much harm as eating it  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes, yikes, yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter eating ice cream for several days in a row I&#39;m tired of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* what lack of limits allows people to feel.

As your son gets older he will see lots and lots of kids  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\neating the things you say are bad. If he&#39;s a compassionate kid, he&#39;ll  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbe afraid for them. (Fear is very unhealthy emotion.)

(More unhealthy emotions.) If he wonders why they&#39;re running  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naround looking healthy and happy when you say the food is bad, he&#39;s  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngoing to wonder if maybe you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; She may be the model of unschooling but is she a nutritionist? What  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; qualifies her to talk about nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has discussed unschooling and building relationships with kids  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfor 17+ years. She has 3 kids: 18, 22 and 23 (I think). They&#39;re great  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkids. They&#39;re honest and thoughtful and really like their parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve met her whole family several times over the years.) How many  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nconventional parents can say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fill your son up with healthy food and he&#39;s yelling at you  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause you won&#39;t let him have a Coke, would you consider that better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re trusting -- without actual experience, and with some reports  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nto the contrary -- that if you control his food that he&#39;ll be healthy  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand he&#39;ll love you for it because to you it&#39;s a loving act.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut control can never feel loving. It feels like someone&#39;s agenda is  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmore important than the person it&#39;s being imposed on. It&#39;s not  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nguaranteed that he&#39;ll fight against you but you&#39;re setting up the  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nenvironment to make that more likely to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about building relationships and then finding ways to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfit the rest of life in. Healthy eating (and safety and so on) are  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nnot tossed out.

Relationships are VERY important and my child&#39;s happiness is more important than having an unhealthy food. I was raised in a way like unschoolers, I chose what I wanted to eat, I could eat ice cream whenever I wanted to, and ate cookies everyday. not only I am still alive :-) that I chose not to eat (that often) any of those.���<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a baby and I can choose what to offer him because not only he can&#39;t tell me that he doesn&#39;t ask for other things. As you say once they get older and start seeing how other people eat they may want to explore it too. And I know it will be different then because they can ask for it and wants it. For now, he like what I give him and I will keep it as healthy as can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANK you for kindly letting me see it. I guess I don&#39;t have experience with older children yet. Even less with unschooling.���<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I fist looked into unschooling it was about education not parenting, and I really like and I totally believe that children and humans learn best when they have the willing to do so, when is self chosen and they are ready.. It took me 28 years to finally like and understand math, in college I got straight A&#39;s. I did it because I was there for myself, I wanted to be there and I was ready to take in the information. ���I will follow my child&#39;s interest and foster his curiosity and I will let him explore because I also believe children learn better by doing things and exploring and not by being lectured with no exploration. Parenting the unschooling ���way is something I have to learn about and try to understand it better. I know I had brought conventional parenting thinking to this group but if I was conventional 100% I would send my child to school and I am not, unless he wants to. So please, bear with me, I am really trying to leave my conventional<br/>\n<br/>\nthinking and to open to better ways to parenting. (not that easy in some aspects).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n--- On Tue, 1/26/10, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 3:10 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n���<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Jan 26, 2010, at 3:43 PM, Monica Van Stelton wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it is very hard for me now to think that I would let my children<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to have ice cream every day and all of that..<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have real kids to talk about rather than made up kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe made up kids can act in all sorts of wild ways that sounds<br/>\n<br/>\nplausible, but it&#39;s more useful to discuss real kids. Made up kids<br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t have reasons for what they do.

But you *are* imposing your choices. Intent doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat matters to the child is what the actions feel like and say to<br/>\n<br/>\nhim. You can explain all you want that your intent isn&#39;t to control<br/>\n<br/>\nor impose, but if it feels like control, it&#39;s the same as if you are<br/>\n<br/>\ncontrolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know that sugar, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils,<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; food coloring, etc is bad<br/>\n<br/>\nBad as in will kill you within the hour?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I bought some cookies that I used to eat in Argentina when I was a<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; child and it had, besides all that I mention also beef fat...yuck..<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They taste delicious but is just like eating a crap cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of those cookies did you have as a kid? I assume you&#39;re<br/>\n<br/>\nstill alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this scenario: You control your son&#39;s eating until he<br/>\n<br/>\nleaves home and then he goes wild gorging on all the forbidden foods<br/>\n<br/>\nand not only does he like them, he feels guilty, but continues anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause his memories of healthy food are wrapped up in memories of<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you raise your son in an atmosphere of healthy eating (by your<br/>\n<br/>\nstandards) with your understandings swirling around in the air. They<br/>\n<br/>\nmake him feel good about the food you enjoy providing. But because<br/>\n<br/>\nyou want him to be happy, he also feels good about exploring other<br/>\n<br/>\nfoods. When he leaves home he may continue to eat as you provided<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause he has warm memories of it. Or he might eat more widely. But<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be unlikely he&#39;d totally reject what you raised him<br/>\n<br/>\nwith because it reminds him of a warm loving home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you control his diet for 18 years and he spends the next 50<br/>\n<br/>\navoiding healthy food will that be better than if he eats fairly<br/>\n<br/>\nhealthy (because of meals and what you bring into the home) with some<br/>\n<br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s explored thrown in, and then for the rest of his<br/>\n<br/>\nlife he continues like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of those two is the most healthy life?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you *want* the scenario to be you provide the right food and<br/>\n<br/>\nright information about food and he continues that for the rest of<br/>\n<br/>\nhis life. That&#39;s very very unlikely. If control worked, we&#39;d all be<br/>\n<br/>\nperfect parents and there would be no need for parenting books!<br/>\n<br/>\n*Everyone* is practically born knowing how to impose their will on<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else to get their way. Two year olds do it! Humans as a<br/>\n<br/>\ngeneral rule don&#39;t like to learn by being told what&#39;s right and<br/>\n<br/>\nwrong. Humans as a general rule like to try things out and find<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your scenario to happen, you&#39;re fighting against human<br/>\n<br/>\nnature and not only likely to be disappointed but will damage your<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If your son is walking on the side walk and sees poo would you let<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; him eat it?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe trusts that you won&#39;t let him eat poop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t help you think clearer if you&#39;re casting sugar into the same<br/>\n<br/>\nbox as poop. Tens of millions of people all over the world are eating<br/>\n<br/>\nsugar. Many many of them are living to old age. There are very few<br/>\n<br/>\npeople eating poop. It won&#39;t help your relationship with your son to<br/>\n<br/>\nsee what he&#39;s eating and enjoying as poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; having it once in a while it won&#39;t do as much harm as eating it<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes, yikes, yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter eating ice cream for several days in a row I&#39;m tired of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* what lack of limits allows people to feel. Limits cause<br/>\n<br/>\nscarcity and a need to get as much as one can before it disappears<br/>\n<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is about TV, but it applies to anything parents want to limit:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandrado\">http://www.sandrado</a> dd.com/t/ economics<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; But it all contributes to ones health and future heart attacks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s healthier to eat healthier than to try to do everything<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;perfectly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA child raised with nothing but pork rinds and Kentucky Fried chicken<br/>\n<br/>\nis probably not going to be as healthy as a child whose mother<br/>\n<br/>\nprovides healthful food but allows her child to explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut is a child whose mother provides healthful food but allows her<br/>\n<br/>\nchild to explore going to be orders of magnitude less healthy than a<br/>\n<br/>\nchild who is only allowed to eat a narrow range of healthy foods by a<br/>\n<br/>\nmother who fears he might eat ice cream everyday?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what you&#39;re doing is taking something that might be bad for<br/>\n<br/>\npeople to base their diets around -- though it depends lots on body<br/>\n<br/>\nchemistry -- and deciding that even a normal amount is bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtremism will interfere in building a relationship with your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be times, many times, when the choice comes between what<br/>\n<br/>\nhe wants and what you want for him. Extremism will cause you to<br/>\n<br/>\nchoose your ideals over him. And that&#39;s not good for any relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; rely on the parent to provide and take care of them and they trust<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that what you offer and the environment offered is safe and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen safe and healthy move into the realms of &quot;because mom&#39;s done a<br/>\n<br/>\nlot of reading and that&#39;s what the experts say&quot; kids begin to<br/>\n<br/>\nquestion it. As your son gets older he will see lots and lots of kids<br/>\n<br/>\neating the things you say are bad. If he&#39;s a compassionate kid, he&#39;ll<br/>\n<br/>\nbe afraid for them. (Fear is very unhealthy emotion.) If he silently<br/>\n<br/>\nwishes he could have what they have (but keeps quiet because he<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to hurt you) he will be filled with envy and possibly<br/>\n<br/>\nanger. (More unhealthy emotions.) If he wonders why they&#39;re running<br/>\n<br/>\naround looking healthy and happy when you say the food is bad, he&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\ngoing to wonder if maybe you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; She may be the model of unschooling but is she a nutritionist? What<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; qualifies her to talk about nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has discussed unschooling and building relationships with kids<br/>\n<br/>\nfor 17+ years. She has 3 kids: 18, 22 and 23 (I think). They&#39;re great<br/>\n<br/>\nkids. They&#39;re honest and thoughtful and really like their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve met her whole family several times over the years.) How many<br/>\n<br/>\nconventional parents can say that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fill your son up with healthy food and he&#39;s yelling at you<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause you won&#39;t let him have a Coke, would you consider that better?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re trusting -- without actual experience, and with some reports<br/>\n<br/>\nto the contrary -- that if you control his food that he&#39;ll be healthy<br/>\n<br/>\nand he&#39;ll love you for it because to you it&#39;s a loving act.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut control can never feel loving. It feels like someone&#39;s agenda is<br/>\n<br/>\nmore important than the person it&#39;s being imposed on. It&#39;s not<br/>\n<br/>\nguaranteed that he&#39;ll fight against you but you&#39;re setting up the<br/>\n<br/>\nenvironment to make that more likely to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about building relationships and then finding ways to<br/>\n<br/>\nfit the rest of life in. Healthy eating (and safety and so on) are<br/>\n<br/>\nnot tossed out. They&#39;re just secondary to the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Gary Null has over 25 years of experience and did many research<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; about nutrition he has a PHD in nutrition. I will also read what he<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; says about eating junk.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Gary Null have teens that love him? Does he have teens he&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nproud of and who are proud of him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone who has 3 teens that have great relationships with<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir parents has more credibility in helping others achieve great<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationships than a nutritionist (who may not have kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n(And Sandra isn&#39;t the only one with grown kids who&#39;ve been radically<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooled for most of their lives. I have 1. Pam Sorooshian has 3<br/>\n<br/>\nalso. Ren has at least a 20 yo and a few approaching and Kelly has 2<br/>\n<br/>\n(though the youngest might still be mid teens). If you haven&#39;t met<br/>\n<br/>\nany of us and our kids, you should! I&#39;d pit our kids on politeness<br/>\n<br/>\nand general all around coolness against Gary Null&#39;s any day ;-))<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your goal is nutrition you *will* have to compromise on<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship. People can&#39;t have two goals. Sometimes one will trump<br/>\n<br/>\nthe other. If you switch back and forth, neither goal will flourish<br/>\n<br/>\nand you&#39;ll seem to your son like you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe choice is heathily-fed teen or teen that you have a great<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with. Which is more important?

Relationships are VERY important and my child&#39;s happiness is more important than having an unhealthy food. I was raised in a way like unschoolers, I chose what I wanted to eat, I could eat ice cream whenever I wanted to, and ate cookies everyday. not only I am still alive :-) that I chose not to eat (that often) any of those. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a baby and I can choose what to offer him because not only he can&#39;t tell me that he doesn&#39;t ask for other things. As you say once they get older and start seeing how other people eat they may want to explore it too. And I know it will be different then because they can ask for it and wants it. For now, he like what I give him and I will keep it as healthy as can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHANK you for kindly letting me see it. I guess I don&#39;t have experience with older children yet. Even less with unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I fist looked into unschooling it was about education not parenting, and I really like and I totally believe that children and humans learn best when they have the willing to do so, when is self chosen and they are ready.. It took me 28 years to finally like and understand math, in college I got straight A&#39;s. I did it because I was there for myself, I wanted to be there and I was ready to take in the information.  I will follow my child&#39;s interest and foster his curiosity and I will let him explore because I also believe children learn better by doing things and exploring and not by being lectured with no exploration. Parenting the unschooling  way is something I have to learn about and try to understand it better. I know I had brought conventional parenting thinking to this group but if I was conventional 100% I would send my child to school and I am not, unless he wants to. So please, bear with me, I am really trying to leave my conventional<br/>\n<br/>\n thinking and to open to better ways to parenting. (not that easy in some aspects).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n--- On Tue, 1/26/10, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@verizon. net&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com<br/>\n<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 3:10 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Jan 26, 2010, at 3:43 PM, Monica Van Stelton wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it is very hard for  me now to think that I would let my children  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to have ice cream every day and all of that..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have real kids to talk about rather than made up kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe made up kids can act in all sorts of wild ways that sounds  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nplausible, but it&#39;s more useful to discuss real kids.

But you *are* imposing your choices. Intent doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat matters to the child is what the actions feel like and say to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhim. You can explain all you want that your intent isn&#39;t to control  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nor impose, but if it feels like control, it&#39;s the same as if you are  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncontrolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know that sugar, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils,  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; food coloring, etc is bad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBad as in will kill you within the hour?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I bought some cookies that I used to eat in Argentina when I was a  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; child and it had, besides all that I mention also beef fat...yuck..  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They taste delicious but is just like eating a crap cake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of those cookies did you have as a kid? I assume you&#39;re  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstill alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this scenario: You control your son&#39;s eating until he  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nleaves home and then he goes wild gorging on all the forbidden foods  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand not only does he like them, he feels guilty, but continues anyway  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause his memories of healthy food are wrapped up in memories of  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you raise your son in an atmosphere of healthy eating (by your  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nstandards) with your understandings swirling around in the air. They  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmake him feel good about the food you enjoy providing. But because  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyou want him to be happy, he also feels good about exploring other  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfoods. When he leaves home he may continue to eat as you provided  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause he has warm memories of it. Or he might eat more widely. But  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be unlikely he&#39;d totally reject what you raised him  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwith because it reminds him of a warm loving home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you control his diet for 18 years and he spends the next 50  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\navoiding healthy food will that be better than if he eats fairly  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhealthy (because of meals and what you bring into the home) with some  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s explored thrown in, and then for the rest of his  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlife he continues like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of those two is the most healthy life?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you *want* the scenario to be you provide the right food and  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nright information about food and he continues that for the rest of  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhis life. That&#39;s very very unlikely. If control worked, we&#39;d all be  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nperfect parents and there would be no need for parenting books!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Everyone* is practically born knowing how to impose their will on  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else to get their way. Two year olds do it! Humans as a  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngeneral rule don&#39;t like to learn by being told what&#39;s right and  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwrong. Humans as a general rule like to try things out and find  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your scenario to happen, you&#39;re fighting against human  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nnature and not only likely to be disappointed but will damage your  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If your son is walking on the side walk and sees poo would you let  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; him eat it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe trusts that you won&#39;t let him eat poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t help you think clearer if you&#39;re casting sugar into the same  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbox as poop. Tens of millions of people all over the world are eating  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsugar. Many many of them are living to old age. There are very few  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\npeople eating poop. It won&#39;t help your relationship with your son to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsee what he&#39;s eating and enjoying as poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; having it once in a while it won&#39;t do as much harm as eating it  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes, yikes, yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter eating ice cream for several days in a row I&#39;m tired of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* what lack of limits allows people to feel.

Extremism will cause you to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nchoose your ideals over him. And that&#39;s not good for any relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; rely on the parent to provide and take care of them and they trust  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; that what you offer and the environment offered is safe and healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen safe and healthy move into the realms of &quot;because mom&#39;s done a  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nlot of reading and that&#39;s what the experts say&quot; kids begin to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nquestion it. As your son gets older he will see lots and lots of kids  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\neating the things you say are bad. If he&#39;s a compassionate kid, he&#39;ll  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbe afraid for them. (Fear is very unhealthy emotion.) If he silently  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwishes he could have what they have (but keeps quiet because he  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to hurt you) he will be filled with envy and possibly  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nanger. (More unhealthy emotions.) If he wonders why they&#39;re running  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naround looking healthy and happy when you say the food is bad, he&#39;s  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ngoing to wonder if maybe you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; She may be the model of unschooling but is she a nutritionist? What  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; qualifies her to talk about nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has discussed unschooling and building relationships with kids  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfor 17+ years. She has 3 kids: 18, 22 and 23 (I think). They&#39;re great  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nkids. They&#39;re honest and thoughtful and really like their parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve met her whole family several times over the years.) How many  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nconventional parents can say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fill your son up with healthy food and he&#39;s yelling at you  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause you won&#39;t let him have a Coke, would you consider that better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re trusting -- without actual experience, and with some reports  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nto the contrary -- that if you control his food that he&#39;ll be healthy  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand he&#39;ll love you for it because to you it&#39;s a loving act.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut control can never feel loving. It feels like someone&#39;s agenda is  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nmore important than the person it&#39;s being imposed on. It&#39;s not  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nguaranteed that he&#39;ll fight against you but you&#39;re setting up the  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nenvironment to make that more likely to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about building relationships and then finding ways to  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nfit the rest of life in. Healthy eating (and safety and so on) are  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nnot tossed out. They&#39;re just secondary to the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Gary Null has over 25 years of experience and did many research  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; about nutrition he has a PHD in nutrition. I will also read what he  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; says about eating junk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Gary Null have teens that love him? Does he have teens he&#39;s  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nproud of and who are proud of him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone who has 3 teens that have great relationships with  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntheir parents has more credibility in helping others achieve great  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationships than a nutritionist (who may not have kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(And Sandra isn&#39;t the only one with grown kids who&#39;ve been radically  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nunschooled for most of their lives. I have 1. Pam Sorooshian has 3  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nalso. Ren has at least a 20 yo and a few approaching and Kelly has 2  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(though the youngest might still be mid teens). If you haven&#39;t met  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nany of us and our kids, you should!

People can&#39;t have two goals. Sometimes one will trump  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthe other. If you switch back and forth, neither goal will flourish  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand you&#39;ll seem to your son like you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe choice is heathily-fed teen or teen that you have a great  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with. Which is more important?

Relationships are VERY important and my child&#39;s happiness is more important than having an unhealthy food. I was raised in a way like unschoolers, I chose what I wanted to eat, I could eat ice cream whenever I wanted to, and ate cookies everyday. not only I am still alive :-) that I chose not to eat (that often) any of those. <br/>\nMy son is a baby and I can choose what to offer him because not only he can&#39;t tell me that he doesn&#39;t ask for other things. As you say once they get older and start seeing how other people eat they may want to explore it too. And I know it will be different then because they can ask for it and wants it. For now, he like what I give him and I will keep it as healthy as can be.<br/>\nTHANK you for kindly letting me see it. I guess I don&#39;t have experience with older children yet. Even less with unschooling. <br/>\nWhen I fist looked into unschooling it was about education not parenting, and I really like and I totally believe that children and humans learn best when they have the willing to do so, when is self chosen and they are ready.. It took me 28 years to finally like and understand math, in college I got straight A&#39;s. I did it because I was there for myself, I wanted to be there and I was ready to take in the information.  I will follow my child&#39;s interest and foster his curiosity and I will let him explore because I also believe children learn better by doing things and exploring and not by being lectured with no exploration. Parenting the unschooling  way is something I have to learn about and try to understand it better. I know I had brought conventional parenting thinking to this group but if I was conventional 100% I would send my child to school and I am not, unless he wants to. So please, bear with me, I am really trying to leave my conventional<br/>\n thinking and to open to better ways to parenting. (not that easy in some aspects).<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 1/26/10, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 3:10 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\nOn Jan 26, 2010, at 3:43 PM, Monica Van Stelton wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it is very hard for  me now to think that I would let my children  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; to have ice cream every day and all of that..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have real kids to talk about rather than made up kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe made up kids can act in all sorts of wild ways that sounds  <br/>\n<br/>\nplausible, but it&#39;s more useful to discuss real kids.

But you *are* imposing your choices. Intent doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat matters to the child is what the actions feel like and say to  <br/>\n<br/>\nhim. You can explain all you want that your intent isn&#39;t to control  <br/>\n<br/>\nor impose, but if it feels like control, it&#39;s the same as if you are  <br/>\n<br/>\ncontrolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I know that sugar, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils,  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; food coloring, etc is bad<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBad as in will kill you within the hour?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I bought some cookies that I used to eat in Argentina when I was a  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; child and it had, besides all that I mention also beef fat...yuck..  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They taste delicious but is just like eating a crap cake.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow many of those cookies did you have as a kid? I assume you&#39;re  <br/>\n<br/>\nstill alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this scenario: You control your son&#39;s eating until he  <br/>\n<br/>\nleaves home and then he goes wild gorging on all the forbidden foods  <br/>\n<br/>\nand not only does he like them, he feels guilty, but continues anyway  <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause his memories of healthy food are wrapped up in memories of  <br/>\n<br/>\nbeing controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr you raise your son in an atmosphere of healthy eating (by your  <br/>\n<br/>\nstandards) with your understandings swirling around in the air. They  <br/>\n<br/>\nmake him feel good about the food you enjoy providing. But because  <br/>\n<br/>\nyou want him to be happy, he also feels good about exploring other  <br/>\n<br/>\nfoods. When he leaves home he may continue to eat as you provided  <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause he has warm memories of it. Or he might eat more widely. But  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be unlikely he&#39;d totally reject what you raised him  <br/>\n<br/>\nwith because it reminds him of a warm loving home.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you control his diet for 18 years and he spends the next 50  <br/>\n<br/>\navoiding healthy food will that be better than if he eats fairly  <br/>\n<br/>\nhealthy (because of meals and what you bring into the home) with some  <br/>\n<br/>\nother stuff he&#39;s explored thrown in, and then for the rest of his  <br/>\n<br/>\nlife he continues like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of those two is the most healthy life?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you *want* the scenario to be you provide the right food and  <br/>\n<br/>\nright information about food and he continues that for the rest of  <br/>\n<br/>\nhis life. That&#39;s very very unlikely. If control worked, we&#39;d all be  <br/>\n<br/>\nperfect parents and there would be no need for parenting books!  <br/>\n<br/>\n*Everyone* is practically born knowing how to impose their will on  <br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone else to get their way. Two year olds do it! Humans as a  <br/>\n<br/>\ngeneral rule don&#39;t like to learn by being told what&#39;s right and  <br/>\n<br/>\nwrong. Humans as a general rule like to try things out and find  <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat&#39;s best for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want your scenario to happen, you&#39;re fighting against human  <br/>\n<br/>\nnature and not only likely to be disappointed but will damage your  <br/>\n<br/>\nrelationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If your son is walking on the side walk and sees poo would you let  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; him eat it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe trusts that you won&#39;t let him eat poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t help you think clearer if you&#39;re casting sugar into the same  <br/>\n<br/>\nbox as poop. Tens of millions of people all over the world are eating  <br/>\n<br/>\nsugar. Many many of them are living to old age. There are very few  <br/>\n<br/>\npeople eating poop. It won&#39;t help your relationship with your son to  <br/>\n<br/>\nsee what he&#39;s eating and enjoying as poop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; having it once in a while it won&#39;t do as much harm as eating it  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes, yikes, yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter eating ice cream for several days in a row I&#39;m tired of it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*That&#39;s* what lack of limits allows people to feel.

As your son gets older he will see lots and lots of kids  <br/>\n<br/>\neating the things you say are bad. If he&#39;s a compassionate kid, he&#39;ll  <br/>\n<br/>\nbe afraid for them. (Fear is very unhealthy emotion.) If he silently  <br/>\n<br/>\nwishes he could have what they have (but keeps quiet because he  <br/>\n<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to hurt you) he will be filled with envy and possibly  <br/>\n<br/>\nanger. (More unhealthy emotions.) If he wonders why they&#39;re running  <br/>\n<br/>\naround looking healthy and happy when you say the food is bad, he&#39;s  <br/>\n<br/>\ngoing to wonder if maybe you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; She may be the model of unschooling but is she a nutritionist? What  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; qualifies her to talk about nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has discussed unschooling and building relationships with kids  <br/>\n<br/>\nfor 17+ years. She has 3 kids: 18, 22 and 23 (I think). They&#39;re great  <br/>\n<br/>\nkids. They&#39;re honest and thoughtful and really like their parents.  <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve met her whole family several times over the years.) How many  <br/>\n<br/>\nconventional parents can say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fill your son up with healthy food and he&#39;s yelling at you  <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause you won&#39;t let him have a Coke, would you consider that better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re trusting -- without actual experience, and with some reports  <br/>\n<br/>\nto the contrary -- that if you control his food that he&#39;ll be healthy  <br/>\n<br/>\nand he&#39;ll love you for it because to you it&#39;s a loving act.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut control can never feel loving. It feels like someone&#39;s agenda is  <br/>\n<br/>\nmore important than the person it&#39;s being imposed on. It&#39;s not  <br/>\n<br/>\nguaranteed that he&#39;ll fight against you but you&#39;re setting up the  <br/>\n<br/>\nenvironment to make that more likely to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about building relationships and then finding ways to  <br/>\n<br/>\nfit the rest of life in. Healthy eating (and safety and so on) are  <br/>\n<br/>\nnot tossed out. They&#39;re just secondary to the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  Gary Null has over 25 years of experience and did many research  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; about nutrition he has a PHD in nutrition. I will also read what he  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; says about eating junk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Gary Null have teens that love him? Does he have teens he&#39;s  <br/>\n<br/>\nproud of and who are proud of him?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone who has 3 teens that have great relationships with  <br/>\n<br/>\ntheir parents has more credibility in helping others achieve great  <br/>\n<br/>\nrelationships than a nutritionist (who may not have kids).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(And Sandra isn&#39;t the only one with grown kids who&#39;ve been radically  <br/>\n<br/>\nunschooled for most of their lives.

They  <br/>\nmake him feel good about the food you enjoy providing. But because  <br/>\nyou want him to be happy, he also feels good about exploring other  <br/>\nfoods. When he leaves home he may continue to eat as you provided  <br/>\nbecause he has warm memories of it. Or he might eat more widely.

They stop trusting the feeling of being full. They start waiting for someone else to tell them when they are hungry and when they are full. And they move toward seeing some food as special, as magical, because it&#39;s been relegated to dessert or to special occassion food. That food becomes so important to have, so emotionally laden, that they just can&#39;t seem to stop eating it. So, even within the population at large, the not-just-unschooling population, food controls have a negative effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of good stories on the unschooling lists about children discovering and forging their own relationships with foods they have problems with, like dairy. Children, given information and support, can make a conscious choice to eat something that may not make them feel good because the pleasure of eating it is enough in that moment. They can also choose not to have the desired food item to avoid whatever happens next. I do it. I know if I eat too much I&#39;m more likely to get indigestion, but sometimes the food is too good to have a small portion, so I choose. I like that Simon and Linnaea choose too. And I watch them not only choose what to eat with an awareness of their own hunger that amazes me (Simon had a craving for gingerbread men, something we hadn&#39;t had for ages, years maybe, because it was a food he had experienced before) and I watch them turn down things that I wouldn&#39;t have predicted. They couldn&#39;t do that if I framed their choices,<br/>\n if I limited their experiences to those I thought as acceptable. As it is their limitations are based on money and availability instead of on my caprice and fear. I way prefer that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nHello,<br/>\nI think that they eating habits are very important specially when they are children because they need to nourish their growing bodies and also because it sets the habits for the rest of their lives ( unless they suddenly realize that it is bad). I&#39;ve seen it once when I went to a buffet, two tables in front of us there was a family, the mom was obese, the father was obese, guess their children...yes, obese. I really felt bad for them and a bit embarrassed for them for being that big and eating at all you can eat type of restaurant. If the daughter would have had parents who care about their bodies ( not for the looks but for the health) I bet she would&#39;ve never been that unhealthy.<br/>\n I think it all starts with modeling healthy eating and behavior. If you do not have ice cream or candy in the house then they can&#39;t eat it. If they never saw it they would never know what it is therefore they would not crave it. I think only when they can understand how sugar, as an example, messes up their body then they could have sugar, because they are making an informed decision and since it is their body they can choose what they want to do. For example,  my child is going to cross the busy road and he is only 10 month old, at that age they don&#39;t understand what would happened if they get hit by a car, so I can&#39;t let him cross. The same way goes for food, I wouldn&#39;t let my child to anything that is not good for him because he doesn&#39;t understand why is not good and what happens to the body when he eats it. Until then I feel responsible for what I offer him and expose him to. <br/>\nAnyway, this is my input...it may not go well with unschooling but I wouldn&#39;t give him anything that I know is not good. IF unschooling is freedom of choice then I can choose not to do something, right? <br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 1/25/10, otherstar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:otherstar@...\">otherstar@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: otherstar &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:otherstar@...\">otherstar@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, January 25, 2010, 8:34 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;You might also look at age and development and how that affects your view of your son&#39;s behavior.  If you began unschooling several years ago and he&#39;s now almost 6, then he was initially at an age where some children are naturally helpful because what grownups do is new and interesting.  By the time you are 6 that&#39;s not so exciting anymore and you want to explore new things.  Let go of your expectation that he will help.  Find joy in the things that he is interested in exploring now and share that with him.  You seem to have gotten to a rather negative place in your thinking about him,&quot;now he is often mean, demanding,and seems to think less of others&#39; feelings.&quot;  Try and focus on the things you like about him, that you enjoy about him, that can work wonders.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to highlight this. I think it is pretty normal for a six year old to be rude and push boundaries. Really, it is normal for all kids to do this. Saying that a 6 year old is mean, demanding, and thinks less of others feelings is kind of harsh. Even if it is true, it comes across very negatively. When my 5 year old gets like this, I try to surprise her with something that she isn&#39;t expecting. I find that it is easy for me to get in ruts in my relationship with my kids. When I am in a rut, all of their negative traits are magnified in my mind. When I find myself thinking that way, I try to find one thing that I can do to change the dynamic. It may be making it a point to find something positive. It may be doing something special. It may be buying them something that they have been wanting. The other day I made it a point to take my five year old out with me by herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had the thought that maybe the six year old is rude and grumpy because he really is hungry. When I don&#39;t have food that my kids like around the house, they don&#39;t eat or will eat something they don&#39;t care for and will do it begrudgingly. I can tell that they are still hungry because they are still grumpy. When I see them doing that, we make a trip to the grocery store together and let them pick out whatever they want to eat. If they pick out ice cream and want to eat nothing but ice cream for the day, that is fine. Ice cream has milk and other trace nutrients. : -) If she isn&#39;t eating like I think I she should, I will whip up her favorite food even if it is a chocolate milk shake. What kids eat for one day or even one week doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is how they eat over time. My 8 year old used to want to eat chocolate and candy all the time. Now that she is older she will turn down sweets in favor of other stuff. My 5 year old is still in the<br/>\nsweets phase. Knowing that her big sister went through a period of a couple years where it seemed like all she ate was &quot;junk&quot; is very comforting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

If it worked for experts to impose knowledge they thought was best on kids, then schools would turn out droves of kids eager and ready for college. Instead all the pressure produces far more kids resentful of being told what to do and unable to decide where they should go.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents are not without influence! It&#39;s up to parents to provide the foundation of what they believe is healthy food because most kids don&#39;t want to create meal plans each week. To be respectful, add in what kids (and partners) request and like. When kids ask why mom&#39;s making a certain choice, mom can share her understanding in an informational way but leaving out pressure to make the same choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about this: Your husband has discovered religion and is worried about your soul. The way he goes about saving your soul is by limiting what you have access to and providing only what he approves. He does it as gently as he can, but there&#39;s still clearly right choices (his) and wrong choices (anything not his). Would you feel drawn to his ideas? Would you feel like he respected and trusted you? Would you feel like spending time with him?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if he discovered religion and, instead, lived it for himself, answered questions when you asked, invited you along when he attended church but accepted no, shared the parts he thought you might like, would you have good feelings about his ideas (even if you didn&#39;t embrace them), good feelings about him, and about his respect for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you continue to hold a tight rein on what your child can and can&#39;t eat, it will feel like the first scenario to him. No matter how certain you are of your ideas being true, it&#39;s far more likely to drive him away and shut his ears to what you so very much want to get into him.<br/>\n<br/>\n**** And I know I can&#39;t make everybody be healthy, as much as I would like, including myself. But it makes me feel sad ****<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting go of the need to change who people are, letting go of sadness over others&#39; choices will help your inner peace.

They don&#39;t come here for more. They come here for something different. Way&#39;s to control kids is everywhere on the internet and in the library. What they need, because the information isn&#39;t readily available, are examples of how to help kids explore food so kids can find what they love and like and hate and want to avoid. <br/>\n<br/>\n**** I won&#39;t impose it on him, but I won&#39;t go to the store to buy it. ****<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t have the power to get in the car and the money to buy what he wants, then how is it not imposed?<br/>\n<br/>\n******** If you know that something is incompatible with unschooling, why put it out there? ****<br/>\n**** Because I am learning about unschooling. ****<br/>\n<br/>\nThe description you quoted says &quot;Ask ... discuss,question, ponder&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guessing if you wanted to learn how to play the guitar you wouldn&#39;t spend the whole hour telling the instructor how you play.

So if you know you can fix the car by going to the mechanic, you wouldn&#39;t go because is not unschooling prespective? ****<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that reasoning, spanking is a solution that should be offered here. And sending them to school,<br/>\n<br/>\nSolutions within the sphere of caring for children are a reflection of a parenting philosophy.

I have a hard time saying no if we go to the store and he is looking a toy...it may be the same with food in the future...who knows. <br/>\nI am not trying to impose my choices...I know that sugar, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, food coloring, etc is bad now how can I let them eat that stuff. I bought some cookies that I used to eat in Argentina when I was a child and it had, besides all that I mention also beef fat...yuck.. They taste delicious but is just like eating a crap cake. If your son is walking on the side walk and sees poo would you let him eat it? Yes I totally want to be a supportive parent like you mention but how can I let my child harm himself if he doesn&#39;t even know that is harmful. Yes, eating ice cream is not going to kill you, having it once in a while it won&#39;t do as much harm as eating it every day. But it all contributes to ones health and future heart attacks, etc. My mother in law had surgery to get on bypass she ended up with 5! And she still chooses to eat bad...It is her choice she is and older woman and knows what can happen if she continues eating<br/>\n like that, but a child don&#39;t know and rely on the parent to provide and take care of them and they trust that what you offer and the environment offered is safe and healthy. <br/>\nThank you for the reply. I will look into what Sandra Dodd says about food and that. She may be the model of unschooling but is she a nutritionist? What qualifies her to talk about nutrition? Please, do not take this personally or get offended I question her...I&#39;ve seen many of her videos, she sounds reasonable and I like her but doesn&#39;t mean that she knows or has the background in nutrition, maybe she does, I will read more about her. Gary Null has over 25 years of experience and did many research about nutrition he has a PHD in nutrition. I will also read what he says about eating junk.<br/>\nThanksMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 1/26/10, Jenna Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamamole@...\">mamamole@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Jenna Robertson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamamole@...\">mamamole@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, January 26, 2010, 10:28 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;And I know I can&#39;t make everybody be healthy&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t make Anybody be healthy.  Everyone can and will make their own choices.  Children will make their own choices as soon as they are over at a friend&#39;s house to play or able to go to the store on their own..  You are coming from a perspective of control.  You are going to control your child&#39;s food choices.  Not having it in the house, not buying it for them, those are ways you impose your choices on your child.  Unschooling is about letting go of control and exploring life with your child.  Your children are then able to learn to trust their bodies, trust themselves and make the choice that is right for them.  They are also able to trust their parents to support them as they explore life.  That way if they make a choice that doesn&#39;t work out the way they expected, they know that mom or dad will be there to help them, not make them feel guilty and bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI struggled with this issue.  We are vegetarians and I&#39;ve always focused on &quot;healthy&quot; eating.  Right now we have food in the house that I would have previously never purchased.  My girls have made hot chocolate (the inexpensive, store brand in a big canister kind) and whipped cream (from the can that you shake and hold upside down) into a food group recently.  We had friends who had the whipped cream at their house and my girls loved the idea.  Some times they have whipped cream And marshmallows (which are not vegetarian) with their hot chocolate.  Some times my youngest has a dish of whipped cream with sprinkles or whipped cream on pancakes.  And some times I squirt the whipped cream right into their mouths.  Do you know how fun it is to spray whipped cream into the mouth of a happy child?  (maybe it&#39;s the nitrous in the can ;)  In our house food is no longer about control, it&#39;s not about good or bad or healthy or unhealthy, it&#39;s about fun. <br/>\n<br/>\n And That is what unschooling is about.  Unschooling is about discovering the joy you can experience together as a family every single day.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe links that others have suggested have great value.  Take some time to read and expand your understanding of unschooling and food :)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJenna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What&#39;s the matter with you?

How can you claim to know exactly what a child needs in order to nourish his body? A lot of people have childhoods where they are constantly exposed to something but choose to reject that as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve seen it once when I went to a buffet, two tables in front of us there was a family, the mom was obese, the father was obese, guess their children...yes, obese. I really felt bad for them and a bit embarrassed for them for being that big and eating at all you can eat type of restaurant. If the daughter would have had parents who care about their bodies ( not for the looks but for the health) I bet she would&#39;ve never been that unhealthy.&lt;&lt; &lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am curious how you know that a family is obese because they don&#39;t care.. There are a ton of things that you do not know about that family. I am obese. Does that mean that I shouldn&#39;t ever eat at a buffet?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I know it is hard to lose weight, I was never &quot;fat&quot; although in my teens I felt like that sometimes. And it was very hard to stop having my cookies and ice cream...Specially because my family even though for the most part ate &quot;healthy&quot; they still didn&#39;t didn&#39;t model good eating habits...My mom still has breakfast with cake and coffee. It doesn&#39;t mean that you should never eat at a buffet but, I think that children learn by modeling and if is that what you model that is what your children are going to learn. It is sad, because it is not healthy for the heart and body, diabetes, heart problems, etc. Please do not take it personally. I don&#39;t discriminate against anybody, my best friend in school was a big girl. I don&#39;t care and didn&#39;t care she was big, small or tall or short, I just felt bad for her health, for the problems she would encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I think it all starts with modeling healthy eating and behavior. If you do not have ice cream or candy in the house then they can&#39;t eat it. If they never saw it they would never know what it is therefore they would not crave it.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it healthy to avoid certain foods at all costs? Not at all cost, but as long as I can without hurting my son. If we are somewhere and he wants cake well, as much as I would prefer he wouldn&#39;t I&#39;d let him but I wouldn&#39;t buy cake at home. We could make a healthier version ourselves.Is avoiding birthday parties because you don&#39;t want your kid exposed to cake and ice cream healthy? <br/>\nDo you police everything in your house to make sure that your child never sees ice cream or candy? How is that healthy? Well, I won&#39;t have cake or ice cream because we do not eat that. Just for special occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I think only when they can understand how sugar, as an example, messes up their body then they could have sugar, because they are making an informed decision and since it is their body they can choose what they want to do.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am an adult and still do not fully understand why sugar is so bad and horrible. I have read conflicting information about it. On some level, I know it should probably be moderated but to be told that I can&#39;t have sugar unless I fully understand that it is going to mess up my body is a huge burden. If I have to choose between something that is posed as going to mess me up and something that isn&#39;t, then there isn&#39;t really a choice there. The thing is that I won&#39;t impose anything I will just model and buy what I know is good for us. I don&#39;t want to be responsible for giving anything I know it is bad. Like the lady I worked for she would give her 2 year old diet coke...when I asked her if she knows that is neurotoxic she said yes and she named other bad things in it..but yet she feed it to her daughter..shame on her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;For example,  my child is going to cross the busy road and he is only 10 month old, at that age they don&#39;t understand what would happened if they get hit by a car, so I can&#39;t let him cross. The same way goes for food, I wouldn&#39;t let my child to anything that is not good for him because he doesn&#39;t understand why is not good and what happens to the body when he eats it.. Until then I feel responsible for what I offer him and expose him to.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eating ice cream is not walking in front of traffic. That is your baggage not his. When a child is 10 months old, it is really easy to think that you can limit what is offered and what he is exposed to. As a child gets older, they naturally get further and further away from mom and expand their social circles. They are going to be exposed to a whole host of things that you have no control over. Setting things up with this dynamic creates a recipe for binging. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, this is my input...it may not go well with unschooling but I wouldn&#39;t give him anything that I know is not good. IF unschooling is freedom of choice then I can choose not to do something, right?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you know that something is incompatible with unschooling, why put it out there? Unschooling is about freedom of choice for the CHILD. You can choose to do whatever you want. We all make choices all the time. I make a lot of choices that are not unschooling but I don&#39;t come to an unschooling list and try to offer them as an unschooling solution or an unschooling perspective. To answer that is that I am here to learn, as described in the front page of the group description. Solutions are solutions and not all fit to the one single person, sometimes there are other way or solutions for things. And even if I unschool my family still doesn&#39;t mean that we all going to agree 100%.  And I really like some of the unschooling principles and need to learn more about the ones I don&#39;t understand or agree. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness FIXED","postDate":"1264522334","msgId":43040,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwNjQ2OC45NDU1LnFtQHdlYjU2MTAxLm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQyODIwMi40Nzk4Mi5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwNy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43039,"nextInTopic":43041,"prevInTime":43039,"nextInTime":43041,"topicId":43024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  This is the second reply that it get somehow erased..bummer, here I go again. ...

There are a ton of things that you do not know about that family. I am obese. Does that mean that I shouldn&#39;t ever eat at a buffet? No, it doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t go to a buffet.

That is your baggage not his. When a child is 10 months old, it is really easy to think that you can limit what is offered and what he is exposed to.

I was worried when it started as all he would eat was shredded wheat cereal for breakfast,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-144556889\">Chrissy,<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has been on &quot;white&quot; food for about 4 years now.  I was worried when it started as all he would eat was shredded wheat cereal for breakfast, cheesy tortillas or mac & cheese for lunch and either skip what I made for dinner or have toast.  (Have you seen the TV show Numb3rs?  Where Larry eats only white food?  We got a good chuckle out of that...) Kids bodies know what they need--I know it is tough to believe...but for some reason that is what his body needs right now.  Frustrating that you can cook foods he doesn&#39;t like anymore, sure!  However, if we relax and support them they do add other things in.  Recently he has been eating 90% white 10% green.  He doesn&#39;t like refined white as much as whole wheat--but we consider it white enough.  If you really watch though you may see that one morning he has orange juice or an orange....or maybe an apple or applesauce.  Yesterday all he wanted for dinner was a cup of broccoli. I think we as parents get so focused on the color of the food (white) that we miss the other colors that do make it onto the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my other theory on the white foods.  Most of these foods (including the OJ and the Broccoli) are high in calcium. Lots of cheeses, milk...I don&#39;t know about your son, but mine has been growing a lot and feeling the growing pains.  His bones must really need the calcium.  Sometimes I think the brain doesn&#39;t know how to tell you what you need so it sends cravings for something you will understand.  Calcium=white foods with some green tossed in.  My dd dislikes bananas, yet she was craving them this week.  She needed potassium and her brain said &quot;bananas&quot;.  We found that a baked potato--high in potassium--worked great and she didn&#39;t have to eat something she has never really liked.  I will crave chocolate which equates to calcium and magnesium.  These are just observations I have made over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like your son, and mine, have a texture thing.  Mine is allergic to red food coloring and tomatoes don&#39;t taste good to him either.  He loves pineapple...  He gets the dark circles too.<br/>\n<br/>\nA wise peditrician told me that kids bodies know exactly what they need and how much.  If a child doesn&#39;t eat their lunch or dinner they will be hungry again soon enough and they won&#39;t starve.  We tend to think in adult proportions, or worse restaurant proportions, forgetting these are kids who have tiny stomachs! lol<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rudeness, it sounds like he is getting it completely.  He sounds like a kid who is rebelling against the way things were.  One who is correct in saying he doesn&#39;t have to do something, unless he chooses too.  We can not control anyone but ourselves.  Putting him in the corner is giving him mixed messages.  &quot;It&#39;s ok to make your own choices but when you do you have to go to the corner&quot;.  I don&#39;t see the love there myself, in fact I see myself going NO, you can&#39;t make me go to or stand in the corner.  I think it would help to put yourself in his shoes.  He is told he can make his own choices as to what he does or how it is done.  We work together because we choose to.  If a child wants to do dishes, they can, but they can also say no.  With no repercussions, no yelling, pleading, coercing.  He needs to know his feelings are valid.  That he is allowed to choose YES or NO.  He is right.  He shouldn&#39;t be sent to a corner and embarrassed or shamed by those he loves.  He may have seemed sweet and kind/helpful, but he could have been doing it to avoid other consequences.  I know I was that way, until I rebelled and said forget that!  He is a kid.  He is going to be sucked up into his own world not noticing what needs to be done in your eyes for a long long time.  If you support him and let him know his decisions are OK whether they are yes or no or whether they conform to what you would like or not, then eventually he will do things without being asked because he SEES it.  Not because it is forced upon him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest is 14 now and he helps out so much without being asked.  He is so relaxed about things now because he knows we honor his Yes and his NO and that he really has an honest choice in any matter.  I have gotten up to find clean laundry ready to be put away simply because he felt like doing it.  Unschooling/Life schooling principles really do work, when you relax and give them time (aka years) to grow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think your son is being rude, it looks like he is being human. Put yourself in his shoes....if your husband told you you had to work together and it was time for you to do the dishes and if you didn&#39;t you had to sit in the corner out of love not embarrassment, you&#39;d be rightfully ticked off.  You&#39;d be rude to him...I know I would be. Once we put ourselves in the shoes of another we can find better ways to interact, find what they need and help them get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this rambling comes across in the way it was meant to.  I haven&#39;t had much sleep. :(  Just hang in there and know we are never meant to fix our kids, only ourselves!  It sounds like you are working really hard to get there.  Just relax.  Housework will eventually get done--your babies are only little for such a short time.

How can you claim to know exactly what a child needs in order to nourish his body? A lot of people have childhoods where they are constantly exposed to something but choose to reject that as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve seen it once when I went to a buffet, two tables in front of us there was a family, the mom was obese, the father was obese, guess their children...yes, obese.

If the daughter would have had parents who care about their bodies ( not for the looks but for the health) I bet she would&#39;ve never been that unhealthy.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am curious how you know that a family is obese because they don&#39;t care. There are a ton of things that you do not know about that family. I am obese. Does that mean that I shouldn&#39;t ever eat at a buffet?   <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I think it all starts with modeling healthy eating and behavior. If you do not have ice cream or candy in the house then they can&#39;t eat it. If they never saw it they would never know what it is therefore they would not crave it.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it healthy to avoid certain foods at all costs? Is avoiding birthday parties because you don&#39;t want your kid exposed to cake and ice cream healthy? Do you police everything in your house to make sure that your child never sees ice cream or candy? How is that healthy? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I think only when they can understand how sugar, as an example, messes up their body then they could have sugar, because they are making an informed decision and since it is their body they can choose what they want to do.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am an adult and still do not fully understand why sugar is so bad and horrible. I have read conflicting information about it. On some level, I know it should probably be moderated but to be told that I can&#39;t have sugar unless I fully understand that it is going to mess up my body is a huge burden. If I have to choose between something that is posed as going to mess me up and something that isn&#39;t, then there isn&#39;t really a choice there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;For example,  my child is going to cross the busy road and he is only 10 month old, at that age they don&#39;t understand what would happened if they get hit by a car, so I can&#39;t let him cross. The same way goes for food, I wouldn&#39;t let my child to anything that is not good for him because he doesn&#39;t understand why is not good and what happens to the body when he eats it. Until then I feel responsible for what I offer him and expose him to.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eating ice cream is not walking in front of traffic. That is your baggage not his. When a child is 10 months old, it is really easy to think that you can limit what is offered and what he is exposed to. As a child gets older, they naturally get further and further away from mom and expand their social circles. They are going to be exposed to a whole host of things that you have no control over. Setting things up with this dynamic creates a recipe for binging. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, this is my input...it may not go well with unschooling but I wouldn&#39;t give him anything that I know is not good.

Unschooling is about freedom of choice for the CHILD. You can choose to do whatever you want. We all make choices all the time. I make a lot of choices that are not unschooling but I don&#39;t come to an unschooling list and try to offer them as an unschooling solution or an unschooling perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness","postDate":"1264486441","msgId":43032,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzMzg5Ny4xNjAzNS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3NjQ3OC4xNDQ4OC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDg3NjQ3OC4xNDQ4OC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMy5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43031,"nextInTopic":43033,"prevInTime":43031,"nextInTime":43033,"topicId":43024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2113930373\"> &lt;&lt;&lt;If you do not have ice cream or candy in the house then they can&#39;t eat it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNot when they are young but even a 7 year old will probably be somewhere where there is ice-cream and candy and then what?<br/>\nWhy is ice-cream off limits???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If they never saw it they would never know what it is therefore they would not crave it. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how are you going to do that? <br/>\nAre you goingto keep them closed up in your home so they don&#39;t find out that ice-cream and candy exists?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I think only when they can understand how sugar, as an example, messes up their body then they could have sugar, because they are making an informed decision and since it is their body they can choose what they want to do.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSugar messes up  people that have diabetes and even those people can have sugar if careful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example,  my child is going to cross the busy road and he is only 10 month old, at that age they don&#39;t understand what would happened if they get hit by a car, so I can&#39;t let him cross.

You seem to have gotten to a rather negative place in your thinking about him,&quot;now he is often mean, demanding,and seems to think less of others&#39; feelings.&quot;  Try and focus on the things you like about him, that you enjoy about him, that can work wonders.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to highlight this. I think it is pretty normal for a six year old to be rude and push boundaries. Really, it is normal for all kids to do this. Saying that a 6 year old is mean, demanding, and thinks less of others feelings is kind of harsh. Even if it is true, it comes across very negatively. When my 5 year old gets like this, I try to surprise her with something that she isn&#39;t expecting. I find that it is easy for me to get in ruts in my relationship with my kids. When I am in a rut, all of their negative traits are magnified in my mind. When I find myself thinking that way, I try to find one thing that I can do to change the dynamic. It may be making it a point to find something positive. It may be doing something special. It may be buying them something that they have been wanting. The other day I made it a point to take my five year old out with me by herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had the thought that maybe the six year old is rude and grumpy because he really is hungry. When I don&#39;t have food that my kids like around the house, they don&#39;t eat or will eat something they don&#39;t care for and will do it begrudgingly. I can tell that they are still hungry because they are still grumpy. When I see them doing that, we make a trip to the grocery store together and let them pick out whatever they want to eat. If they pick out ice cream and want to eat nothing but ice cream for the day, that is fine. Ice cream has milk and other trace nutrients. : -) If she isn&#39;t eating like I think I she should, I will whip up her favorite food even if it is a chocolate milk shake. What kids eat for one day or even one week doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is how they eat over time. My 8 year old used to want to eat chocolate and candy all the time. Now that she is older she will turn down sweets in favor of other stuff. My 5 year old is still in the<br/>\n sweets phase. Knowing that her big sister went through a period of a couple years where it seemed like all she ate was &quot;junk&quot; is very comforting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food and rudeness","postDate":"1264482466","msgId":43030,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyMjUyMS4yNDMzOC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhqbDZhMCtwaGQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhqbDZhMCtwaGQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43029,"nextInTopic":43031,"prevInTime":43029,"nextInTime":43031,"topicId":43024,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Its not clear how long have you let go started unschooling., your son is not quite 6 yet .  I am going to try to understand so bear with me. -=-=-=-=-=-=- ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1375793646\">Its not clear how long have you let go started unschooling., your son is not quite 6 yet .  I am going to try to understand so bear with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;clark will be six in just a few weeks and when he was little he loved all kinds of foods but mostly fruits and vegetables and prepared all different ways too! i have read that it is natural for children&#39;s taste buds to become ultra sensitive and for them to begin refusing foods they have always loved so i was ok with it for a long time. after about a year i started to worry so they started taking a chewable supplement which i suppose is better than nothing but it still isn&#39;t food.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean after about a year since you started saying  yes more and letting them eat what they want?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; now it&#39;s been literally years of him eating barely anything that isn&#39;t white. for almost a year know i have been trying the unschooling philosophy about food but it still isn&#39;t working.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOk Let me see if I got this right. WHen your ds was little he ate some fruits and vegetables then he started eating ONLY white foods.<br/>\nHe was eating only white foods before you were unschooling. Then a year after you started unschooling and he is still eating the same way. DId I get this right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;when he makes choices on his own without my giving him any advice or anything he eats cereal and some sweets. when i give him some advice and information (like think about what you ate today and what your body needs to thrive etc) it is a bit better but not even close to enough. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many issues here in this phrase.<br/>\nSo if you don&#39;t say anything he only eats cereal and sweet stuff ( whatever that is)<br/>\nIf you  tell him his choices are not good he may eat a little better.<br/>\n&#39;SO you are still telling him he is not making the right choices.

YOu really need to step back and stop guiltying him into eating what you think is good for him and letting him make his choices.<br/>\nEating out of guilt and something you do not want to are a step from an eating disorder.<br/>\nI rather my kid eats only white stuff, cereal, a little salad and 3 fruits all his life than to put that upon him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;when his eating is the most limitied in variety i see him growing paler, his nails growing slower, and dark circles under his eyes.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he sometimes eats more variety?
