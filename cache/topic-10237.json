I have <br/>\nbeen lurking and reading everyone&#39;s posts on nutrition and on being <br/>\ntoxic.  Very interesting reading. ;)  <br/>\nWe&#39;re so excited about tomorrow, I just have to share...we&#39;re getting <br/>\ncockroaches!!!   <br/>\nMadagascar Hissing Cockroaches, to be exact.  I have to go find an <br/>\naquarium to put them in today.  DH has been wanting some ever since we <br/>\nsaw some at a presentation, so now we&#39;re getting some.  I&#39;m actuallly <br/>\npretty excited about it, I guess because I don&#39;t feel they will be as <br/>\nmuch trouble as most of his pets he drags in.  ;)  <br/>\nWhen I told my mom, she said I have too much time on my hands.  Maybe, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s nice.  I can&#39;t afford to adopt children, so I adopt pets to <br/>\nkeep me busy.  I sometimes think, though, if I didn&#39;t have so many <br/>\npets I could afford a baby.  Vicious cycle.... ;)  <br/>\nI am thinking about putting together a presentation on getting pets <br/>\nnot knowing what their care is and then getting rid of them when it <br/>\ngets difficult, time-consuming, or expensive.  We have a ferrett we <br/>\ngot when its owner didn&#39;t have the time to play with it (a <br/>\nreccommended 4 hours a day of supervised play time)  We have rabbits <br/>\nthat I suspect were used for breeding, and which had been abused.  Now <br/>\nwe are getting the roaches...the lady said they got them last fall and <br/>\nwere tired of them.  I had thought of a presentation outlining why <br/>\npeople get pets and then get rid of them, and how to keep that from <br/>\nhappening.  Maybe go to schools and clubs...  I don&#39;t know, though, <br/>\nprobably won&#39;t ever get it done.  :)<br/>\nIt&#39;s cold this morning and I&#39;m not wanting to move (my computer is in <br/>\nfront of the heater).  But, all good things must come to an end, and <br/>\nI&#39;m getting hungry.  I&#39;ll talk &quot;at&#39;cha&quot; more later, let you know how <br/>\nthe roaches are. :)<br/>\nPaige</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10213,"nextTopicId":10240}}
