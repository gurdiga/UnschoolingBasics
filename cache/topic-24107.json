Always home, electic mostly unschooling<br/>\nuntil radical unschooling last 4 years.<br/>\nI don&#39;t normally post. Thanks to all of you who do.  Your words are<br/>\nsoothing and eye opening.<br/>\nJust had to say that I did it again.  A fight over public education<br/>\nwith a public school teacher sister-in-law.  Ended up hurting her<br/>\nfeelings and now am feeling guilty for it.<br/>\nJust couldn&#39;t take one more &quot;well educated&quot;, &quot;need to learn to sit<br/>\nstill&quot;, &quot;bathroom breaks when allowed--even when 3 have peed their<br/>\npants this past month&quot; nonsense.<br/>\nI look at my 2 wonderful kids and look at my little 2 year old<br/>\nday-cared heading to preschool niece and wanted to scream.  In the<br/>\nprocess I stumbled over my words and made our relationship worse. <br/>\nMy 14 year old son said I lost my normal non judgemental attitude. I<br/>\nsay I was being passionate :)<br/>\nReally though, I apologized in person and in a letter.  I just wish I<br/>\ncould be eloquent when speaking. If they (the family) knew just how my<br/>\nkids got to be so smart. My homeschooling is tolerated, unschooling<br/>\nwould be a can of worms.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24124,"nextTopicId":24129}}
