One of my biggest pieces of advice for those trying to lose<br/>\nweight, was to NOT limit themselves, but to try and focus on ADDING<br/>\ncertain things to their diet. ADD more water drinking, ADD more fruits<br/>\nand veggies, the thought process of adding to diet is much more<br/>\nfulfilling and works better in the long run than trying to keep food<br/>\nOUT....feeling limited usually backfires.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think pop-tarts are nasty little things.:)<br/>\nBUT, I don&#39;t make a big deal when my kids want some and I CAN go buy a<br/>\nhealthier version if we need to have them around a lot.

I think the best thing I can do for my children,<br/>\nis look at their food choices as part of the learning experience and<br/>\ntrust that they will find a balance that is best for them eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy job is to provide lots of healthy, delicious foods, help them try<br/>\nthe things they want, provide them with information (when they&#39;re<br/>\nready for it) and not stress if they eat pop-tarts!!:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"blog comment","postDate":"1154700417","msgId":16256,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhdmthMStpaTVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16255,"nextInTopic":16257,"prevInTime":16255,"nextInTime":16257,"topicId":16196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I cheered for the lion when she erupted from her cornfield jungle to chew up on the guy.

My mom never let us have  <br/>\nany kind of junk food, fast food or snacks. I&#39;m about 60 pounds  <br/>\noverweight, still trying to recover from the urges I have to binge.  <br/>\nI&#39;m also terrible at sharing, because in my subconscious, I never  <br/>\nknow when I&#39;ll be allowed more. It&#39;s only taken me 16 years to get to  <br/>\nwhere I can hear it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn TV. Kids&#39; aren&#39;t designed to be overweight couch potatoes. the  <br/>\nfreedom to watch TV doesn&#39;t create them...the restrictions that force  <br/>\nthem to gain every second they can because they don&#39;t trust the  <br/>\nadults in their lives NOT to take it away is what creates couch  <br/>\npotatoes. If a child is only allowed to watch TV for one hour, they  <br/>\nwill sit for every second they have. If a child feels judged while  <br/>\nwatching, he may turn it off and the parent thinks they&#39;ve won, until  <br/>\nthey find ten years later that the child either doesn&#39;t trust the  <br/>\nparent or the child watches mindlessly because they&#39;ve never KNOWN  <br/>\nthey can watch TV for pleasure or that they can even learn something.  <br/>\nChildren who know that they can turn the TV on any time they wish are  <br/>\nfree to turn it off whenever they wish, because they can trust that  <br/>\nthey can use it later. Ironically, once my children had that freedom  <br/>\nto watch, they spent a lot less time watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to try to generalize kids who watch TV and  <br/>\neat sugar as doing it all the time, and it&#39;s certainly not as likely  <br/>\nas one think to create overweight couch potatoes. I don&#39;t even know  <br/>\nof any unschoolers who do that consistently. It may look like it, but  <br/>\ntheir time is broken up into segments of interest.  Kids who grow up  <br/>\nrestricted either break out of the mold (&quot;Wow...now that I&#39;m out of  <br/>\nthe house, I&#39;ll be hiking when I feel like it&quot; and it won&#39;t happen  <br/>\nagain, or &quot;I&#39;m never doing that again&quot;) Of course, now I&#39;m  <br/>\ngeneralizing, but from reading on all the unschooling stuff, it is  <br/>\nfar more likely for a restricted child to do that than an  <br/>\nunrestricted child to overindulge. It&#39;s worth it to plan about eight  <br/>\nmonths to let the kids sit in front of the TV to know that they are  <br/>\nlearning about their true interests, not one that may have been  <br/>\nartificially created through restrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more comment, the original post has a lot of &quot;we&quot; being used...do  <br/>\nyou mean you and your husband chose those things, or that your kids  <br/>\ndid too?

Maybe sending all our kids to school would be a better idea. NO <br/>\ncouch potatoes *there*!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Those schooled kids wake up EARLY and eat a PopTart while they ride <br/>\nthe bus to school where they sit in a chair all day until they&#39;re <br/>\nallowed (whether they are hungry or not) to go wolf down a corn dog and <br/>\nfries with jello or pudding and a milk. Then they go BACK to their <br/>\nchairs and sit for another few hours. After the last school bell rings, <br/>\nthey ride a bus home and then sit on another chair or lie on their beds <br/>\nand do homework while munching on some chips and a coke. Then they eat <br/>\nsupper (fast food or a meal hastily prepared by mom---mac & cheese or <br/>\nHamburger Helper?) before watching the two hours of TV/video gaming <br/>\nthat they are allowed before they go back to their rooms to sit in a <br/>\nchair while on the computer. Then they stay up as long as they possibly <br/>\ncan before they have to get up EARLY and eat a PopTart while they ride <br/>\nthe bus to school where they sit in a chair all day until they&#39;re <br/>\nallowed to go.........<br/>\n<br/>\n Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The *school system* is creating couch potatoes. Unschoolers DO things. <br/>\nThey visit friends. They go to the store. They visit museums and zoos <br/>\nand parks. They spend hours playing instruments or with the dog. They <br/>\nget enough sleep. They eat GOOD food, when they are hungry. They can <br/>\nswim or run or bounce or swing whenever they want to. They work *with* <br/>\ntheir bodies. They can learn how their bodies feel with a lack of <br/>\nsleep, with enough sleep. They can learn which foods work best for <br/>\nthem, how much exercise they need/want to feel good. They watch tv <br/>\nbecause they *want* to, not because they have no other options.<br/>\n<br/>\n Unschooling does NOT produce couch potatoes.

They are not learning to trust their<br/>\nbodies when mom controls all their food.  so when on their own they may tend<br/>\nto go overzealous with their eating because they haven&#39;t learned that eating<br/>\n3 meals a day for a month At McD&#39;s will make you feel bloated, overweight,<br/>\nlistliss, and gross (not that I am advocating this diet - our family gags<br/>\nwhenever we pass most fast food places and we ate at them often).

I gave over the<br/>\ncontrol of that to her years ago.  We both fully acknowledge that when she<br/>\nconsumes RD40 that she acts differently.  But it is her choice.  For a while<br/>\nshe went hog wild, eating all the formerly colored foods that were<br/>\nforbidden.  After a while she realized that she didn&#39;t like the way that she<br/>\nfelt when she ate certain foods and decided to eat alternatives instead.<br/>\nSometimes she still has food containing RD40, but it always reminds her why<br/>\nshe abstains from it.

First you have to find the value in television.<br/>\nYou have to see their viewing television as part of their joyful lives and<br/>\nthat there is merit in television.  Second YOU watch with them.  Learn their<br/>\nlives.  Understand their shows (or in my case try to understand their video<br/>\ngames - which I am dreadfully inept at) Third, you strew (do a search<br/>\nthrough the archives for strewing) and make opportunities to expand their<br/>\nworld.  Sometimes that strewing is other television shows.  Sometimes the<br/>\nstrewing is a museum or park or activity.  Sometimes it is more of what they<br/>\nare doing.

The reason that I find it so amusing is <br/>\nthat a parent gives their child complete freedom, from having very <br/>\nlittle freedom, and then wonders why their child will only watch <br/>\nTV.  Usually those comments are made within a couple weeks of <br/>\nallowing that freedom and it takes MUCH longer than that for kids to <br/>\nlearn how to regulate themselves and start listening to their <br/>\nbodies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that always comes to mind when I read comments like <br/>\nthat is &quot;What are you offering them that is so much more exciting <br/>\nthan watching TV?&quot;  When my kids watch a lot of TV it is usually <br/>\nbecause I am being lazy and not doing anything with them or not <br/>\noffering them a choice that seems better to them.  The more <br/>\ninteresting my life is and the more options I give them the less the <br/>\nTV is on.  When my kids say &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot;  what they are really saying <br/>\nis &quot;Mom, I either want you to do something with me or help me find <br/>\nsomething interesting to do.&quot;  I have learned to cue into that now <br/>\nbut I used to let it go and guess what?  They would turn the TV on <br/>\nand watch it all day long!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe definitely go through spurts of lots of TV viewing but for the <br/>\nmost part our lives are too interesting to sit in front of the TV <br/>\nall day.  The other side is that what is so bad about TV?  My kids <br/>\nhave learned a TON watching TV and it is always funny to have family <br/>\nmembers that are very critical of TV be amazed at some of the things <br/>\nmy kids know and ask them where the heck they learned <br/>\nthat...........................&quot;TV!!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know though that in our family it took about two years after <br/>\nletting go of trying to control everything for us to live an <br/>\ninteresting, full life like the unschoolers lives that I read <br/>\nabout.  We were raised in a very strict, fundamentalist, legalistic, <br/>\ncult-like religion.  We didn&#39;t have TV in our home, we couldn&#39;t wear <br/>\npants, cut our hair, etc,  Our entire life was controlled by someone <br/>\nelse.  My husband and I only left that religion four years ago and <br/>\neven though we were technically unschoolers we certainly weren&#39;t <br/>\nRU&#39;s and I still tried to control my children&#39;s lives.  Thank <br/>\ngoodness for my sis, Ren, who really helped me see life from a <br/>\ndifferent perspective and taught me how to start seeing things out-<br/>\nof-the-box!!!

And still other days when<br/>\npeaches and television are a good thing.  But it took trusting my kids with<br/>\ntheir own freedom and stepping back and observing even minute things and<br/>\nbeing able to appreciate all the things my kids did as being valid before I<br/>\ncould release that fear that my children were going to grow up into mindless<br/>\nzombies that weighed 800 lbs and needed a crane to remove them from their<br/>\nhouses as they clutched their last box of Ho-Ho&#39;s to their dying chests.<br/>\n:-)  It&#39;s that &quot;inside perspective.&quot;  We dont&#39; have scientific studies to<br/>\nprove it.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to let my children, young as <br/>\nthey are with maturing brains and bodies, buy and eat whatever they <br/>\nwant.  I do let them get things they like from the natural food store <br/>\nbut when we&#39;re in the regular grocery store I turn down suggestions to <br/>\nbuy pop tarts, for example, and cereal they see advertised on tv.  <br/>\nSpecial occasions like our recent camping trip do we splurge and eat <br/>\nsome less nutritious foods, but at home we have a pantry and <br/>\nfreezer/fridge full of fruits and veggies (that they love eating anyway) <br/>\nand snacks without trans fat and artificial preservatives and colors.  <br/>\nWe also limit fast food because we eat only natural/organic meats but we <br/>\ndo visit Micky Dees from time to time so I don&#39;t think they would ever <br/>\nbe likely to binge when they are older and on their own more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as tv goes, how do you not end up with overweight couch <br/>\npotatoes?  Luckily I don&#39;t think I have to worry about that as my <br/>\nchildren have remained pretty active, even when we dropped our &quot;school <br/>\nat home&quot;, at least for the time being.  Granted it&#39;s been in the 100&#39;s <br/>\nthis past week so we&#39;ve all been vegging inside but we are nature lovers <br/>\nso that&#39;s in our favor...but I know this is a question people ask a lot <br/>\nregarding unschooling picturing kids sitting in front of the tv and <br/>\nchowing down on chips and candy bars all day.<br/>\nThanks again<br/>\n<br/>\nAmy in WV</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"blog comment","postDate":"1154615273","msgId":16196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhdDE1OStucHR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16201,"prevInTime":16195,"nextInTime":16197,"topicId":16196,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I got this comment at my blog today, thought some of you might want to add your own thoughts so I can share some of them at my blog on this very topic: ~~ I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1241616721\">I got this comment at my blog today, thought some of you might want to<br/>\nadd your own thoughts so I can share some of them at my blog on this<br/>\nvery topic:<br/>\n<br/>\n~~&quot;I find it interesting that when unschoolers say this, everyone is<br/>\nsupposed to just take it on faith that this is true, but if someone<br/>\ncomes along and says that they have observed something different,<br/>\nunschoolers rush in to blame it on everything under the sun than the<br/>\nfact that maybe some kids will just veg in front of the tv forever if<br/>\ngiven the chance.
