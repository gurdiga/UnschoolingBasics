Welcome to the list. I know there is a HUGE group in the UK  that <br/>\nunschools----they even have a big camping weekend once a year. Maybe if you  <br/>\ncould get together with them, she could chat with other teens and maybe other  <br/>\nmoms and see that it DOES work. If you can&#39;t find a group---let us know.  We <br/>\nput out a call to the other Brits and ask them for more info about  this <br/>\ngathering.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I really want to do unschooling, to live an  unschooling life, but my <br/>\n </span></blockquote>eldest has reservations. We have tried nearly all  the different home <br/>\nschool methods over the past 5 1/2 yrs and they always  start off <br/>\nwell then lead to resistance. &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nWhen I asked my dd  about her reservations, she informed me that yes <br/>\nit may be fun until she  becomes 16, and is then unable to go to <br/>\ncollege becasue she hasn&#39;t done her  GCSE&#39;s (UK qualification most <br/>\ncolleges ask for) She is afraid she will end  up stupid, doing a job <br/>\nthat she hates and said it will be because she didn&#39;t  laern anything <br/>\n(think she means academics)when she was  younger.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThe other &quot;formal&quot; homeschooling you&#39;ve been trying these past five years  <br/>\ndid this damage! She believes that she can only learn if someone is teaching  <br/>\nher. And she believes that learning *must* look  academic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are a lot of &#39;shoulds&#39; and &#39;meant to  do&#39; &#39;at her level&#39; in her <br/>\n </span></blockquote>speech probably from dh who believes it is our job  to challenge and <br/>\nstretch her. Dh also believe unschooling is better for  those who are <br/>\nartistic based and not academic based!!  grrrrrrrrrr&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s HER job to challenge and stretch herself. And she WILL do it  <br/>\neventually. We&#39;re hard-wired to do just that. But not while everyone else is  doing it <br/>\nfor her.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m artistic. But when I was in school, I was academically-based. I was  <br/>\ngoing to vet school, so *I* felt I needed lots of math and science and Latin and  <br/>\nGreek. *I* pushed myself in that direction. And HARD! Had I been unschooled, I <br/>\n STILL would have been driven to study these things. I was driven. I still <br/>\nam!  &lt;g&gt; But in different things at different times. <br/>\n <br/>\nI would have loved _The Well-trained Mind_ as a kid! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How can I help her see unschooling can  be what she wants it to, that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>she can do anything and life can continue to  be fun- becaaue I <br/>\nbelieve it can and there are always choices, and that you  don&#39;t have <br/>\nto take a job you ahte and you don&#39;t have to go to college  because <br/>\nall your friends are (she doesn&#39;t want to play catch up) But there  <br/>\nis a lot of comparison to her peers how they are going to <br/>\ncollege...it&#39;s  like she doesn&#39;t know who she is and what she wants <br/>\nto  do..&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think you need to find some adults/older teens who have done *what*  they <br/>\nwant to do----and who are happy doing just that.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe at an age that&#39;s difficult because she can&#39;t see that far into the  <br/>\nfuture AND she&#39;s believing what her peers and society tells her. My son was  really <br/>\nunsure about this new unschooling journey at that age too. But now his  <br/>\nschooled friends are absolutely miserable in high school, while he pursues what  <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested in. He&#39;s the happiest teen he knows! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nYou really need to make some contact with other unschoolers IRL. That helps  <br/>\nIMMENSELY with teens. At last year&#39;s conference, we saw a couple of teens that <br/>\n thought their moms were *nuts* for even contemplating unschooling. They <br/>\nchanged  over the weekend when they met 20 or so teens that were so incredibly <br/>\nhappy with  their lives. They discussed what they do during the days (and nights! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;)  and they found common interests. Several are getting together next <br/>\nmonth to hang  out!<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyone else have info about this camp-out in the UK? Or an unschooling  <br/>\ncontact there? I get the Freedom in Education newsletter from the UK every  <br/>\nmonth----but is there a contact person? Conferences? <br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling is about learning whatever strikes your fancy. If she *wants*  to <br/>\nlearn more academically-based stuff, well, that&#39;s her own unschooling. But it <br/>\n would be at her pace and what interests HER. <br/>\n <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t touch Elizabethan history with a ten foot pole! But I&#39;m a nut  for <br/>\nEgyptian, Roman, Greek, Celtic, Revolutionary, Civil War, Tsarist  Russia, & <br/>\nWWI history! She may have a special time in history that  fascinates her. And <br/>\nscience----I love most of biology----but ONE-CELLED JUNK? No  way! I think <br/>\nphysics is pretty cool---but chemistry???<br/>\n <br/>\nShe can make her unschooling as schooly as she&#39;d like. Mine would have  been! <br/>\nBut she needs to understand that it can look like whatever she&#39;s  interested <br/>\nin.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf she complains that she wants to learn these things, but doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>\ndo the work----well, then she DOESN&#39;T want to learn it. Not really. We&#39;re each  <br/>\ncapable of learning pretty damned complex things when we want to. It&#39;s truly  <br/>\namazing. She just needs to think about this a bit.<br/>\n <br/>\nHas she read _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_? Or have you read it to  her?? <br/>\nHow about Frank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_? Two really  <br/>\ngreat books for teens to really understand that THEY are in charge of what goes  <br/>\ninto their heads!<br/>\n <br/>\nGood luck----and I hope to see you back here! I&#39;ll work on some contact  info <br/>\nin the UK!<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana Matt","from":"Dana Matt &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How can I help my daughter?","postDate":"1104170392","msgId":4478,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjI3MTc1OTUyLjY1MDAucW1haWxAd2ViNDA0MjgubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGNxcGRmaCtwYjAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4477,"nextInTopic":4507,"prevInTime":4477,"nextInTime":4479,"topicId":4477,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Unschooling isn t about *not* learning academics, it s about learning what s important to her--so obviously, if that s important to her, she will choose to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-900623287\">Unschooling isn&#39;t about *not* learning academics, it&#39;s<br/>\nabout learning what&#39;s important to her--so obviously,<br/>\nif that&#39;s important to her, she will choose to learn<br/>\nit.
