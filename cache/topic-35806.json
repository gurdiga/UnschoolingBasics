The big, important part <br/>\nof &quot;sensitive periods&quot; is that the goal of the adult is to be <br/>\nobservant - to watch for times of sensitivity and then feed them. In <br/>\nunschooling terms we say it this way: support your kids&#39; passions. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a 2yo that may mean a passion for running in circles and <br/>\nknocking things over - in montessori terms that&#39;s a sensitive period <br/>\nin terms of gross motor coordination and learning about the basic <br/>\nphysics of motion and states of matter. It doesn&#39;t mean trying to <br/>\nexplain to that child the need to slow down or clean up, it means <br/>\nfinding space to run and building endless towers to destroy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14yo has gone through some &quot;sensitive periods&quot; recently - he&#39;s <br/>\nexploded into writing and programming. Our challenge has been to <br/>\nprovide ways for him to do that where he can feel comfortable and <br/>\nsupported. Its not a time to correct his grammer and ask &quot;but what&#39;s <br/>\nit *for*?&quot; Its time to feed the passions themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts always okay to offer - do you know about &quot;strewing&quot;? here&#39;s a <br/>\nlink: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe important point to consider is that the goal of strewing is to <br/>\nprovide options and choices, not to find a way to sneak lessons on <br/>\nmagnets and paper-folding into kid&#39;s lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>\n&gt; long lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>\n&gt; from the start they will forever have learning difficulties. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The irony is, schools are the worst places for creating exactly <br/>\nthose kinds of learning difficulties. A free child, free to explore <br/>\nand develop along his or her own exact timetable, will create his or <br/>\nher own unique system of &quot;scaffolding&quot;. Its inherent in how humans <br/>\nlearn. We build our own set of connections - are building them all <br/>\nthe time. We don&#39;t need to Give children someone else&#39;s scaffold - <br/>\nif anything that disrupts the learning process and interfere&#39;s with <br/>\nthe child&#39;s own scaffolding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>\n&gt; parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect you&#39;ve never hung out with any unschooled kids who have <br/>\nunlimited tv. It doesn&#39;t look the way you are afraid it will look. <br/>\nYes, some kids watch a lot more tv than others, but kids who are <br/>\nused to free tv also do much much more conncurrently with watching. <br/>\nThey play and build and write and draw and paint and pretend. If <br/>\nyour kids&#39; tv has been limited, they haven&#39;t had a chance to learn <br/>\nthese skills, yet. They&#39;re still &quot;hoarding&quot; and &quot;binging&quot; when <br/>\nthey &quot;get&quot; to watch tv, rather than using tv as one of the many <br/>\ntools in their environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I see my kids spending a Lot of time in front of the tv I ask <br/>\nmyself one question: what do they need? Sometimes we get in a rut <br/>\naround here, especially with only one vehicle. So the kids need some <br/>\nfun, some excitement in their lives. Something that&#39;s more <br/>\ninteresting than the tv. Changing seasons is a common time for that <br/>\nto happen in my house. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes what the kids need is actually being met by the tv. <br/>\nReally. Tv can be a wonderful source of information presented in a <br/>\nvisual format - very empowering for kids who don&#39;t read yet, or who <br/>\nare more visual learners. Tv can also be a way for kids to explore <br/>\naspects of the world that aren&#39;t readily available to them - <br/>\ncurrently my 7yo wants to go to Africa and China. That&#39;s not an <br/>\noption for my family, but she can look at books and magazine and <br/>\nwatch shows and movies that help her learn more about those parts of <br/>\nthe world. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14yo is busy exploring Big Ideas - concepts of space and time and <br/>\nmorality and justice and his place in the universe. He doesn&#39;t find <br/>\nbooks very accessible, so he uses the tv and the internet to find <br/>\nout what other people have thought about similar Big Ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>\n&gt; have no opportunity/ resources for school? Are those children<br/>\n&gt; unschooled too or is it our communities resources and our parental<br/>\n&gt; attention that makes the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There *are* places in the world where school is a better option than <br/>\nhome - some of those places are families (in developed nations, too) <br/>\nwhere there is abuse or other misery in the home. Some of those <br/>\nplaces are areas where there are few resources in the home to help <br/>\npeople learn to live and work in our technological world. When kids <br/>\ncan get what they need to thrive at home, outside education is <br/>\nunneccesary. That&#39;s one of the fundaments of unschooling - we can <br/>\nprovide more and better than the schools, in more areas of life. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12252351,"authorName":"Gwen","from":"Gwen &lt;willow_selene@...&gt;","profile":"willow_selene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New unschooling concerns/questions","postDate":"1221120821","msgId":35842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxMjIyLjg4NzE5LnFtQHdlYjUwNDAxLm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhN2VsaCt1cmJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35839,"nextInTopic":35844,"prevInTime":35841,"nextInTime":35843,"topicId":35806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter just turned seven.

When she was younger she loved to go to the library.  This was great because I love books.  I love libraries.  I get a real rush walking into a library.  Bookstores make me swoon.  I loved going to the library with her and seeing what books she would pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past year so, Megan hasn&#39;t liked libraries.  She doesn&#39;t like books.  She has one or two that she loves (Knufflebunny comes to mind), but she isn&#39;t interested in exploring her world via books. She likes that I can look up information on the internet.  She loves youtube and video games (Zoo Tycoon and similar).  She explores her interest in animals by watching Animal Planet and other shows I find for her.  She also does tons of pretend play (pretending she&#39;s a vet and pretending she&#39;s an animal and I&#39;m the vet).<br/>\n<br/>\nToday she asked me if all turtles like to swim.  I told her I wasn&#39;t sure and we could look it up online or we could go to the library.  She said she saw the library line coming from a mile away and she wasn&#39;t going to the library.  :-)  She also didn&#39;t want to go online.  She was happy to talk about why turtles might like to swim and if we could think of a type of turtle that didn&#39;t.  We didn&#39;t get very far.  Her animal interests are largely big cats...so the turtle thing was new for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan she read?  When she wants to read, she does.  We were at the zoo a few weeks ago and she read an entire informational plaque by herself for herself.  If I had said &quot;read this, prove to me you can read&quot; she wouldn&#39;t have done it.  If she had said &quot;read this for me&quot; I would have.  Lately she has been experimenting with spelling.  On her own.  If I tried to &quot;force&quot; the issue, she&#39;d stop.  So I&#39;m going along for the ride and it is way more interesting to let her lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 9/9/08, stephaniedenap &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:stephaniedenaples@...\">stephaniedenaples@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My son has no interest in learning how to read (maybe bruised by my<br/>\n&gt; prodding?) but would have me read to him all day?

We are learning something that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seems relevant to them. So, spongebob is not relevant to us, <br/>\nwhich is why we can&#39;t see what&#39;s there to learn. But I do know my <br/>\nson did learn of some aquatic animals by watching squarepants LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo what I&#39;ve read about Maria Montessori and her beliefs in <br/>\nsensitive periods from birth to 6 yrs old. I think it&#39;s possible to <br/>\nalign this philosophy along unschooling, afterall it is just about <br/>\nmental and brain development. I aligned The Philoshy of Classical <br/>\nEducation along mine - very similar to this montessori idea, it&#39;s <br/>\njust that the CE has a wider and longer age segment and it only have <br/>\n3 age segment- google it, and you&#39;ll find lots to read about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe unschoolers talks about naturally learning. We talk about <br/>\nallowing the child to pursue thier own interest and learn from it, <br/>\nand it&#39;s not necessary Maths or reading. Maths and reading is <br/>\nnormally a secondary produce, that happened to be involved. A happy <br/>\naccident, i would say. I know it sound horrible, kinda like  a hit <br/>\nand miss situation. But it is not, because Maths and reading is very <br/>\nmuch part of our daily existance. So, when our kids pursue thier <br/>\ninterest, they will come in contact with some form of maths and <br/>\nreading in a more natural setting. This will help them understanding <br/>\nthe application and usage of it. You see, it is the understanding <br/>\nthat creates the learning, and not the memorising. It is when Maths <br/>\nis taken out of context and presented in an abstract format, that&#39;s <br/>\nwhen it become confusing and hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if we&#39;re unschooling, we cannot expect the child to voluntaryly <br/>\nwant to seek reading and maths activities just because at age 4 - 6 <br/>\nthey are supposed to be reading and math readiness. But I supposed <br/>\nwe can facilitate such periods, by strewing books and tv shows with <br/>\nthis elements around them (i did this) but we cannot expect nor <br/>\nforce them to pick it up and pay attention to them.

Which is why it&#39;s called SELF <br/>\ndiscipline and not IMPOSED discipline. The reason we have self <br/>\ndiscipline is because we have priority list of things that needs <br/>\ndoing. In order to accomplished this list of things, we need a <br/>\nschedule, which requires us to monitor our time usage. This is <br/>\ncalled A discipline, a set of systems or regulations. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour priorities is very very different compared to your kid&#39;s. <br/>\nTherefore your self discipline pattern will be very difference <br/>\ncompare to your kid&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou as a mother and home-person have a very long list of priorities. <br/>\nHousework, cooking, responsibilities, yourself and educating your <br/>\nkid. Which means you need a very tight and busy self dicipline if <br/>\nyou need to accomplish much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour kid, on the other hand, has very little priorities, for now. He <br/>\nonly does what&#39;s relevant to a kid - which is to play, watch and <br/>\nlearn. No responsibilities, no deadlines, no accomplishement. For <br/>\nnow, his days will be filled with multiple on-going process of <br/>\nlearning thru watching and playing, which will form his ONLY <br/>\npriorities for now.  He doesn&#39;t do housework for it&#39;s not relevant <br/>\nto his needs, he doesn&#39;t do responsibilties for he hasn&#39;t got any. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo his self discipline will be very simple and relax for now. For <br/>\nwhat can you expect out of a little mind that&#39;s only been alive for <br/>\n6 years on earth? Everything takes time, just like from crawling to <br/>\nwalking to running. He hasn&#39;t got much target to hit. Everything he <br/>\ndoes now will be open-ended, Never finish, but it&#39;s always a new <br/>\ndiscovery.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHis priorities list will grow longer as he matures, adding onto it <br/>\nmore and more interest and things to accomplish. Soon, you&#39;ll find <br/>\nthat he&#39;ll have 20, if not more, things to create, to research, to <br/>\ntalk about, to read about or to build. Questions to ask, puzzles to <br/>\ndicipher. Soon he&#39;ll wants to complete something, a sense of <br/>\naccomplishment is needed. This is when he&#39;ll evoke his own SELF <br/>\ndiscipline- his own internal set of system to work with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you have the next 10 years to facilitate his discovery/ <br/>\nlearning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, start facilitating that language learning interest of his, by <br/>\nreading to him, as he requested. My child is a very good reader, <br/>\nhe&#39;s 8 and he still wants us to read to him every night. And yes, I <br/>\nbelieve it is tru reading to him every night for the past 8 years is <br/>\nwhat makes him an excellent reader, which eventually manifest into <br/>\nan excellent speller. My child read first, then learn to spell <br/>\nlater.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also very good at Maths too. Just by casual observation and <br/>\nconversation and lots of video/ online games.  We do abit of pc <br/>\nlessons which is games based, only when he wants too. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur days are filled with lots of tv watching, lego, video gaming, <br/>\nonline gaming, funny experiments (we&#39;re stuck on fire and burning <br/>\nstuff and learning lots about chemistry). No structure, no routine, <br/>\nno expectations. He eats what he wants, I eat what I want. We are <br/>\nreally 2 very individual characters at home all the time, until <br/>\nhubby comes back, and he makes 3. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeography starts when daddy&#39;s home because news will be on, and <br/>\ndocumentary shows will most likely follows. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have my &quot;am I doing right?&quot; days but that&#39;s expected, for I am <br/>\ndealing with a real lively talkative child, not a robot.

Anything <br/>\nthat the brain is &#39;sensitive&#39; to will be learned, lessons not <br/>\nrequired. Our culture is awash in symbolic language (that&#39;d be <br/>\nreading) - there&#39;s no way a child in an average American household <br/>\ncan avoid being exposed to letters and sounds. And, it gets absorbed <br/>\nin exactly the amount and timing that they can handle at that time. <br/>\nSo, what&#39;s the point of specifying &#39;sensitive&#39; periods if you are <br/>\nmaking the whole world accessible freely and facilitating each <br/>\nindividual child&#39;s interests, regardless of whether it falls in <br/>\na &#39;sensitive&#39; period.

To help see  through unschooling  <br/>\neyes, the world is full of things kids are interested in and not  <br/>\n(yet) interested in. Anything a child is interested in is filled with  <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Educational&quot; items are often set up to lead the child from where  <br/>\nthey are to some goal. It&#39;s done that way because schools need to  <br/>\ndemonstrate to parents, administrators and the state that learning is  <br/>\ntaking place. They need a goal and they need to have a way to show  <br/>\nthe child has reached the goal (tests).<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning happens whether those outside the child know it or not.  <br/>\nWhich makes unschooling scary and frustrating! We want to see it and  <br/>\nreassure ourselves that it&#39;s happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut kids learn to speak without testing or educational toys. Kids go  <br/>\nfrom not knowing language exists to having it nailed before they  <br/>\nreach five. But society dismisses that totally awesome achievement as  <br/>\nthough it were magical. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s how kids learn: they play  <br/>\naround with something, they use it for personally meaningful  <br/>\npurposes, they get feedback on how well what they tried worked and  <br/>\nthey refine their use. And they aren&#39;t even doing that deliberately.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s how humans are hardwired to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about how easy it is for kids to learn to speak without a  <br/>\nlesson or test in sight. Think about how hard it is for kids to learn  <br/>\nSpanish in school with lots of lessons and tests? Which works better?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it works for everything a child wants to know. The problem is  <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t look at all like school learning. It looks like  <br/>\nplaying. It looks like watching TV. It looks like chatting. It looks  <br/>\nlike messing around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>\n&gt; parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t let my daughter watch TV all day. But she had the freedom to  <br/>\nchoose what she wanted to do. TV was one of the things available.  <br/>\nBefore 10 she watched a little. Between 10 and 11 she watched a lot.  <br/>\nAfter 11 TV watching dropped off again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Maybe for some kids<br/>\n&gt; they would eventually get bored or move on to other things, but my<br/>\n&gt; kids would sit there ALL day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids will watch TV &quot;all day&quot; for several reasons. One common reason  <br/>\nis because they know it&#39;s limited. They need to cram it in now while  <br/>\nit&#39;s available because they may not be able to get it later. (Very  <br/>\ntypical adult behavior when adults know a limit is approaching.  <br/>\nHappened majorly during past gas crises.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother is because it&#39;s the least boring option. If life isn&#39;t  <br/>\nsparkly, TV can look like the best option. The problem is that often  <br/>\nparents will look around at all the toys and see the kids watching TV  <br/>\nand feel as though the TV had some magical drawing power. In some  <br/>\nways maybe it does. I think it fills in a social niche that&#39;s  <br/>\nprobably missing. My daughter didn&#39;t play often with her stuffed  <br/>\nanimals unless someone else was over to do it with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd another is that during the prepubescent years 10ish to 12ish  <br/>\n(give or take) kids are transitioning from kid interests to teen  <br/>\ninterests. It&#39;s an awkward between stage where it&#39;s hard for them to  <br/>\nfigure out what interests them. And maybe they also become more  <br/>\nsubconsciously interested in social relationships so they&#39;re drawn to  <br/>\nthe drama of social interactions on TV. It&#39;s *very* common for that  <br/>\nage to become fascinated by Nikelodeon and Cartoon Network.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one more is that kids can feel trapped by the programmers&#39;  <br/>\nschedule. My daughter (when she was 10-11, found it hard to walk away  <br/>\nfrom cartoons because she didn&#39;t know what she might miss. If we were  <br/>\ngoing out I&#39;d put in a tape for her to record them. More often than  <br/>\nnot she wouldn&#39;t watch it later. She just needed to feel she had the  <br/>\noption to watch or not watch. What helped hugely was getting TiVo so  <br/>\nshe could program in her favorite shows and watch them whenever she  <br/>\nwanted. Her TV watching went *way* down after that (though she was  <br/>\nalso older and getting beyond the prepubescent stage. I wish we had  <br/>\ngotten it a year earlier so I could give a more accurate picture of  <br/>\nthe effect. But she was showing less TV watching when the programs  <br/>\nwere taped so I&#39;m speculating that she would have been more  <br/>\ndiscriminating with TiVo.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but my<br/>\n&gt; kids would sit there ALL day.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra Dodd has made a collection:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/ifilet\">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is that once parents get unschooling, their kids aren&#39;t  <br/>\neven coming close to doing the things the parents were sure they  <br/>\nwould. Kids may do more than the parents would have chosen for them,  <br/>\nbut they do eventually (once they get past the initial glut period,  <br/>\nonce they wear out the newness of a new game) do other things. It   <br/>\nhelps lots if parents aren&#39;t pulling the kids away, but are providing  <br/>\nplenty of other opportunities that the kids like as well as or better  <br/>\nthan a single activity. (But sometimes that single activity *is* what  <br/>\nthey want to do and the best thing is to keep the door to other  <br/>\nthings open while they get  what they want from the experience.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just don&#39;t believe that just because<br/>\n&gt; they are happy watching Spongebob, I should allow it. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; misunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re seeing Spongebob as non-educational. Unschoolers see that  <br/>\nenjoyment means they&#39;re getting something they need from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the hard things to grasp about unschooling. Mainstream  <br/>\nsociety divides the world into play and work. (Learning being lumped  <br/>\nin with work.) Unschoolers know that profound learning comes from  <br/>\nengagement and fun and enjoyment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that we let them go and watch Spongebob until their  <br/>\neyeballs fall out and feel our task is done. Unschooling is about  <br/>\nfilling their lives with things they enjoy (since enjoyment means  <br/>\nlearning). Unfortunately that sounds like &quot;keeping them entertained,&quot;  <br/>\nbut that&#39;s not unschooling. That&#39;s seeing life through Puritanical  <br/>\nschoolish eyes where learning is child&#39;s work. Unschooling is  <br/>\nrecognizing that learning happens when kids are exploring what  <br/>\ninterests them and makes them happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>\n&gt; long lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when they<br/>\n&gt; are sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>\n&gt; from the start they will forever have learning difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Teachers speak with such authority. The speak as though they know  <br/>\neverything there is to know about learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not one of them has ever experienced a child who has had the  <br/>\nopportunity to learn on their own schedule whatever interests them.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally think about that. He&#39;s speaking as though he knows that it  <br/>\nisn&#39;t possible, but neither he, nor his professors, nor the authors  <br/>\nof any of the textbooks he read, has ever met an unschooling family.  <br/>\nThey simply are completely ignorant of natural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is they think they know because to educators kids without  <br/>\nschool don&#39;t exist. All teachers know is the behavior of kids in  <br/>\ncoerced learning environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do<br/>\n&gt; Unschoolers feel about the Montessori theory of &#39;sensitive&#39; periods<br/>\n&gt; when the developing brain is most able to learn certain things (e.i.<br/>\n&gt; languages)?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s something to that, but less than educators might theorize.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s important to realize they have no way of testing it. What will  <br/>\nthey do? Have two sets of kids: one who are given reading instruction  <br/>\nand a control group where reading instruction is withheld? And do the  <br/>\nsame with math instruction? But all they&#39;d be testing is the results  <br/>\nof presence or lack of instruction. Unschoolers may not instruct, but  <br/>\nthey fill that gap with life where kids are exploring the concepts by  <br/>\nusing them in real, natural, personally meaningful ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously it&#39;s much easier for kids to absorb language when they&#39;re  <br/>\nlittle. But most adults -- who don&#39;t shut down from fear -- find that  <br/>\nimmersion is the best way to learn a language. Just like little kids.  <br/>\n(An adult has to be open to the learning and actively using it. Just  <br/>\nbeing plunked down in a foreign country without the desire to work at  <br/>\npicking up the language won&#39;t work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think another thing that makes people believe that earlier is  <br/>\nbetter is child prodigies. They start early and master early. It  <br/>\n*seems* like the big factor is starting early. But the big factor is  <br/>\nthat prodigies are *pulling* in what fascinates them. That&#39;s what  <br/>\nlittle kids are doing with language: they pull it in because it&#39;s  <br/>\ninteresting and they&#39;re finding it useful for their own purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter started taking guitar lessons two years ago after 15  <br/>\nyears of not showing much musical inclination other than liking to  <br/>\nlisten to rock. At first she practiced what she was told to do and  <br/>\nmaking slow progress. It was frustrating for her. Then in November  <br/>\nshe discovered Van Halen and wanted to be like Eddie :-)  At that  <br/>\npoint she started *pulling*  in everything she could and her progress  <br/>\nshot up. (If anyone wants to see what she could do 8 months after  <br/>\nfinding a passion for 80s rock, you can see her friend&#39;s recital with  <br/>\nKill the King by Megadeth:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXyxZh4ups\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMXyxZh4ups</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThey only had two practices together. The beginning, she said, is  <br/>\nsimple, just keeping the beat basically but halfway through she gets  <br/>\nto solo and demonstrate what passion does for learning :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nForce and going through the motions can&#39;t replace the effect of the  <br/>\npassion to pull stuff in. And unfortunately we can&#39;t control passion.  <br/>\nBut we can open all the doors so for them to explore and find passion  <br/>\nfor themselves and then support their exploration. The Van Halen Vol  <br/>\n1 DVD would hardly be classified as educational by any educator but  <br/>\nit&#39;s probably more learning-filled than any &quot;educational&quot; item we  <br/>\nbrought into the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>\n&gt; have no opportunity/ resources for school?

He also went outside to run on the newly plowed fields surrounding us and helped to feed the baby mouse that he and Linnaea rescued from one of our cats yesterday. But mostly he&#39;s been watching a couple of different Let&#39;s Play programs on youtube. Linnaea and I watched an Wile Coyote cartoon where he dug through the earth and ended up in China which got me looking for a program that I can remember using where you could dig through the earth and come up on the other side to see where you&#39;d end up from New Mexico or Arizona.<br/>\n Google Earth has a program that lets you do that, so I installed Google Earth and then added the network link that lets you dig through the earth. Turns out you need to be in South America to hit China. All of the Southwest that I explored puts you in the ocean. All of the UK seems to drop you off near New Zealand, but still near some deep sea vents, I imagine. Not very inspiring for a child with a shovel. But really cool to have at my internet fingertips. <br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely allow my children watch television all day. Turns out there are very few days when that is all that they do. Even if the television is on in the background there are a lot of other things going on. Eating, drawing, creating, gaming, running after cats, feeding baby mice, having friends over, baking pies, mowing the lawn, dancing DDR, whittling...and it just goes on. If I didn&#39;t allow them television all day, television would become the best thing they got to do that day. It would be the apex of a series of apex-worthy activities. Maybe it is somedays. Maybe the new episode of My Name is Earl trumps swimming or hanging in the hot tub or making apple juice. Yay! Thank you television writers and producers. Because I give them the freedom to choose what they do they don&#39;t have the added benefit/costs of limitations driving their choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nMaybe for some kids<br/>\nthey would eventually get bored or move on to other things, but my<br/>\nkids would sit there ALL day. <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGive them a chance. Some days it is the most engaging thing in our house. Not often. Usually television is most interesting on a day after a day that is really full and engaging and exhausting. Or when there is a new show that they&#39;ve been waiting for coming on. Youtube has ameliorated some of that, but it still is exciting to catch a new episode or a new show. You are doing your children a disservice. You are creating a powerful monster of the box in your living room, or wherever it is in your house. The only things that engage my children for hours and days are things that are really interesting. Television sometimes is that thing. Sometimes it&#39;s books. Linnaea loves the Warrior Cats series and we&#39;ve been reading through those for months now. Simon can get quite focused on a specific video game, the last one was Super Mario Smash Brothers for the Wii. But other things can capture their interest as well. Simon loves story telling. He doesn&#39;t share his<br/>\n stories very often, but he likes to own the things he watches. It is a hugely physical thing and he&#39;s done it for years, 7 years maybe, maybe 8. He will run and move and work through a story and craft the whole thing. He&#39;s currently working on one based on Bakugan, a series that he&#39;s watched much of on youtube. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy limiting television you&#39;ve made it the most interesting thing in the house. You&#39;ve made it super powerful, super strong. It is like the apple of knowledge (or pomegranate, or whatever it was), the very fact of making it forbidden made it more interesting, more sought out. And when they do watch it, seemingly like zombies for hours, you get your proof. Because you know that television is like a drug and will stun your children with it&#39;s e-lectronic rays when they do zone out to it, you have your proof. When you stop thinking of television as the opiate of the masses it will help you to see it as a means of engaging with the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the zoo the other day and saw the kangaroos. I mentioned that the male kangaroo has a bifurcated penis, two heads, better than 1. Simon said the female has 3 vaginas. I thought maybe two, but not 3. Nope they have 3 vaginas. He&#39;s right. Yay television!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI just don&#39;t believe that just because<br/>\nthey are happy watching Spongebob, I should allow it.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI love Spongebob. There is so much going on in that cartoon. What is your criteria for letting someone do something? I ask this in all seriousness. Being happy watching Spongebob seems a good reason to watch it. I&#39;ve watched a lot of Spongebob. I love the FUN song. I love that Spongebob becomes a dishwashing sponge on a stick when above the water. I love the way the creators have played with the laws of physics underwater. Its a beautiful show. There are reasons why they might be expected to be happy watching Spongebob. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip?<br/>\nMy brother is a teacher and gave me a<br/>\nlong lecture about &#39;scaffolding&#39; and how children have ages when they<br/>\nare sensitive to certain concepts and if the structure is not there<br/>\nfrom the start they will forever have learning difficulties.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a Senior Lecturer  (read assistant Professor) at a medical school in the UK. It&#39;s a school that uses Problem Based Learning as it&#39;s curricullum. David mentioned tonight while we were making dinner together that doctors from UEA don&#39;t take a lot of hardcore science. They don&#39;t study anatomy unto memorization. It isn&#39;t part of the curricullum. However, when they are tested as doctors, there is no difference in anatomic understanding between those more classically educated and those educated using the more modern approach. Scaffolding is worth questioning. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I just went and looked up what scaffolding in education is and I got irritated. Scaffolding is when you, the student,  build knowledge through experience based on the rules that a teacher lays out for you. The rules are the scaffolding. But you don&#39;t put scaffolding up around a building as you build it. You put scaffolding up, against an already existing building usually, to work on either a building that is in need of repair or maintenance or to go up higher on a building that you are constructing. But there has to be building in place for there to be scaffolding. I&#39;m sure that it is born from the term foundations in learning. They wanted to stick with the construction industry analogy. Man. It just bothers me. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m wrong. David&#39;s experience isn&#39;t relevant. Wikipedia has the best definition I can find of scaffolding: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding.\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding.</a> According to the definition I scaffold all the time. I help Simon and Linnaea achieve their goals, engage with their interests by supporting them (which building scaffolding doesn&#39;t do) during the process. I don&#39;t define the building though. I am not a mold that I want them to conform to. They are much more interesting and engaging being their own selves. I certainly don&#39;t want to define or limit them. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n How do<br/>\nUnschoolers feel about the Montessori theory of &#39;sensitive&#39; periods<br/>\nwhen the developing brain is most able to learn certain things (e.i.<br/>\nlanguages)?<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is probably a time to acquire first language skills. The problem is that anyone who didn&#39;t get it as an infant was in a really screwed up environment and it is hard to figure out if that was the cause of language delays or if it was the not being open to language during the sensitive period. But there isn&#39;t any sensitive period to second language, or it is still debated whether there truly is a sensitive period for second language acquisition. It&#39;s kind of cool thing to research. There is actually still active debate about the degree to which there is a sensitive period to first language acquisition. If the theoreticians are right about that your eldest is beyond the window and your youngest is just about out of it. It might be worth your peace of mind to let go of the notion. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nHow do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>\nhave no opportunity/ resources for school? <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 3 computers in my home. I have access to lots of museums and art galleries and scientific equipment and theatre and movies and television and food and books and so on and so forth. I live in a world filled with plenty. I share that with my children. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAre those children<br/>\nunschooled too or is it our communities resources and our parental<br/>\nattention that makes the difference?<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are unschooled at the basic level. If not schooling is your level of requirement for unschooling than yes they are unschooled.  Among the Mayans of Belize that David interviewed when he was doing his dissertation fieldwork many had little school experience. Often they could read and do math. They needed those skills when dealing with the people who were buying their crops, so they got them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CX3QCaqLtJ8?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"&quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New unschooling concerns/questions","postDate":"1221070258","msgId":35817,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwOTEwMTExMG80ZjYyZWFlNnYzZjM5Y2MyMTNjYTA1OTVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhOHB1cStybjQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQwMDIwNi42OTMxOC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8Z2E4cHVxK3JuNDVAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35816,"nextInTopic":35818,"prevInTime":35816,"nextInTime":35818,"topicId":35806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***Can you feel the pressure without letting it change how you relate to your children?

We found out the game that<br/>\nmost of his friends used and got it. He doesn&#39;t read so we played it with<br/>\nhim. He reaally got into it so we looked for the play books. They contain<br/>\nmaps, charts, special stuff, etc. We learned/played along with him. He<br/>\nwanted more, we found pokemon toys, online game, books to read, dvds, etc.<br/>\nWe have recently found the card game yu-gi-u through this.

We are in Pittsburgh. At some point either<br/>\nyour family will &#39;get&#39; it or you will have to make it known to them<br/>\nthat these are your children and if they care about their learning,<br/>\nthen they can choose to become more supportive or they can back off<br/>\nwith all the negativity. If your family can not support you and<br/>\ninteractions are always negative and have you second guessing<br/>\nyourself, then limiting interactions with the family is healthy. If<br/>\nit&#39;s not possible to limit, then make it clear that homeschooling<br/>\nisn&#39;t up for debate.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Where I begin to get nervous with unschooling is when I read of<br/>\n&gt; parents allowing their kids to watch TV all day.

It is only<br/>\nnatural for children (and adults) to rebel against arbitrary limits &<br/>\nrules. There is obviously something that THEY find valuable in<br/>\nSpongebob...maybe you can sit down and watch with them and during<br/>\ncommercials or after an episode, you can ask them about it their<br/>\nfavorite parts or why they love that particular episode more than the<br/>\nlast one. Also, children use TV just like adults  to unwind and tune<br/>\nout...if the the rest of their day is full of limits and rules (as<br/>\nwell as &#39;schooly&#39; pressure) then TV is &#39;heaven&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sure many of you understand the real pressures from society and<br/>\n&gt; the fears they can encourage.

I understand the pressure, but I also learned a long time ago<br/>\nthat if I do what other people then I am not being true to myself and<br/>\nI am usually miserable.

Children &#39;need&#39; to learn to read by 6,<br/>\nbecause if they don&#39;t, then teachers have a hard time teaching! When a<br/>\nstudent doesn&#39;t read or doesn&#39;t read up to the level YOU &#39;need&#39;, then<br/>\nyou &#39;have to&#39; do all the work and can&#39;t shovel heaps onto them. In<br/>\nschool, there are plenty of learning milestones that need to be met,<br/>\nif a teacher is to do his/her job. However, we ALL know and talk about<br/>\nhow every child is different, learns different and on their own time<br/>\ntable. You can not accurately or fairly compare unschooled children<br/>\n(even some homeschooled) to schooled children...when you are not free<br/>\nto learn, then you end up being &#39;educated&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do unschooled children differ from say, developing nations who<br/>\n&gt; have no opportunity/ resources for school?

Does everyone<br/>\n&#39;need&#39; school to meet that idea of success? Can the idea of success be<br/>\nchanged. When a lot of the world is more concerned about when the next<br/>\nmeal will take place and whether or not it will, they could care less<br/>\nabout &#39;school&#39; as you or I know it. I could be wrong, but I do believe<br/>\nthat most developing countries has at least private schools available<br/>\nand even &#39;primative&#39; basic grammar schools...it would be most third<br/>\nworld countries that have very little to no &#39;school&#39; as we would<br/>\ndefine it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, children all over the world (unless they are separated by<br/>\nschool) learn from their parents what they need to know to build their<br/>\nhomes, make a fire, hunt (if necessary), sew, cook, basic healing and<br/>\nso on. Positive parental attention and involvement always makes a<br/>\ndifference for the better, no matter where you live. <br/>\n<br/>\nmichele<br/>\nwww.naturalattachment.net</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301158115,"authorName":"amberlee_b","from":"&quot;amberlee_b&quot; &lt;amberlee16@...&gt;","profile":"amberlee_b","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New unschooling concerns/questions","postDate":"1221067667","msgId":35822,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhOTAyaithZTNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTEwMDYwNGk1YjE2YTlhZnBhMzJhY2YyOTUzZTBjNmEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35821,"nextInTopic":35825,"prevInTime":35821,"nextInTime":35823,"topicId":35806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oooooo we would love a carnival like that!!!!

I really don&#39;t. Discipline<br/>\n&gt; seems to me to come from an external source. Self-discipline always reeks of<br/>\n&gt; hair shirts and medieval lessons in piety to me. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself<br/>\n&gt; a particularly disciplined person, and yet I manage to do most of what I<br/>\n&gt; want to do. I have even managed to change my habits. But it isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; discipline, it&#39;s choice that makes it possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I do things that I may not enjoy. I clean up dog poop in the yard<br/>\n&gt; regularly. I do it not because I enjoy the act, but because I enjoy the end<br/>\n&gt; result. I like not having crap on shoes and bare feet and not smelling it as<br/>\n&gt; I walk through the yard. It isn&#39;t self-discipline that brings me to that<br/>\n&gt; decision, it is desire. I want to have a pleasant garden. So, for me, doing<br/>\n&gt; things I don&#39;t want to do only happens when I want the outcome of the act.<br/>\n&gt; And, actually, I can sometimes even enjoy the process. I used to hate doing<br/>\n&gt; the dishes. Really hated it. In the early days of my relationship with David<br/>\n&gt; we used to go as long as possible without doing the dishes. It was kind of a<br/>\n&gt; waiting game to see who would give in first. I like doing dishes now. I find<br/>\n&gt; it peaceful to put my hands in the warm water and stare out the window and<br/>\n&gt; make them clean. It is such a calming process. When things are overwhelming<br/>\n&gt; I find it very relaxing, or even if things are only mildly crazy it<br/>\n&gt; gives me 15 minutes of space. It also produces an end result that I enjoy.<br/>\n&gt; At 4 and 6 there isn&#39;t a big sense of time or causality. It is hard to see<br/>\n&gt; that doing something unpleasant can lead to something pleasant. Age and time<br/>\n&gt; give you perspective. I wouldn&#39;t expect a 6 year old to get that there are<br/>\n&gt; things you have to do even if you don&#39;t want to do them. I still don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; that and I&#39;m 40. But, if there were things that I, the parent, wanted done,<br/>\n&gt; like cleaning a room, I would do them. I might invite Simon or Linnaea to<br/>\n&gt; help, but I would do them, without resentment, even if they said no. The<br/>\n&gt; things that I want done are about me and not about Simon and Linnaea. A<br/>\n&gt; clean room is my need not theirs. If they want something done, like having<br/>\n&gt; their toys in an order they can cope with, than I am happy to help, or<br/>\n&gt; cooking some culinary creation that they dreamt up or desired. I&#39;ll even do<br/>\n&gt; the clean up. I figure I get to help make their childhoods joyful, I take<br/>\n&gt; that pretty seriously.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been unschooling/ homeschooling 2 boys (6yr and 4yr) for a<br/>\n&gt; little while now. We have tried the traditional homeschool approach<br/>\n&gt; and I am exhausted of arguing,pleading, threatening, bribing,coercing ,<br/>\n&gt; my son to &#39;do his school&#39;. I saw a bright, curious, book loving boy<br/>\n&gt; begin to become negative and distant, so unschooling seems very<br/>\n&gt; enticing to us.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; At 6 your son isn&#39;t school age in many place and at 4 your youngest isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; mandatory school age anywhere I know (ooh, Northern Ireland has a compulsory<br/>\n&gt; school age of 4, so I&#39;m wrong). What so you think they require at such young<br/>\n&gt; ages that takes arguing, pleading, threatening, bribing and coercing? You<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t been unschooling if that is what it is taking. Unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &quot;do school&quot; at its most basic, your list of manipulation argues that you are<br/>\n&gt; a long way from basic unschooling. It sounds like you&#39;ve been very intensive<br/>\n&gt; to have your son switch from joy to resentment so quickly.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son has no interest in learning how to read(maybe bruised by my<br/>\n&gt; prodding?) but would have me read to him all day?

I am worried he will never<br/>\n&gt; learn to read...<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 6 to never is a long, long drive. My son is 11 and he isn&#39;t a fluent reader<br/>\n&gt; yet. I know children who weren&#39;t fluent until they were 13 or older. And yet<br/>\n&gt; you cannot tell them from earlier readers. Maybe that isn&#39;t comforting.<br/>\n&gt; Maybe what you want to hear is that unschooling will give you a guaranteed<br/>\n&gt; reader by age x. Ther isn&#39;t a guarantee. School doesn&#39;t give you a<br/>\n&gt; guaranteed reader by age 18. Unschooling, I think, has a better track<br/>\n&gt; record. The difference is that in school you are labelled for not reading by<br/>\n&gt; a certain age, in unschooling the label isn&#39;t applied so there is no need to<br/>\n&gt; be limited by it. Unschooling can help you to see the glory in the<br/>\n&gt; non-reader. Simon listens in ways that I cannot. He pays intense attention<br/>\n&gt; to visual and audial information where I look for the written word. I have a<br/>\n&gt; really hard time listening to someone read a book, but he can be mesmerized<br/>\n&gt; by books on cd and knows exactly what is going on. Playing video games with<br/>\n&gt; him is<br/>\n&gt; really enlightening, he picks out the clue to the next step so much faster<br/>\n&gt; than I do while I try and pick the clue out from text or what I remember<br/>\n&gt; from the written word. And he remembers details from conversations that I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t catch or don&#39;t remember, he listens.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Not reading early is not a handicap. And 6 is early. Worrying about it and<br/>\n&gt; pressing and prodding for it just helps your son to feel like he is stupid<br/>\n&gt; or obstinate to not be reading yet. It won&#39;t get him reading any earlier<br/>\n&gt; than he&#39;s going to read without you worrying. Actually it might make it<br/>\n&gt; later, it might just make him feel like it is something too difficult and<br/>\n&gt; too awful and he just can&#39;t do it. Relax and read to him as much as he<br/>\n&gt; likes. What a treat for you. Simon prefers having Stephen Fry read to him<br/>\n&gt; these days. He can go on and on and on whereas my voice gives in after a few<br/>\n&gt; chapters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; www.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171305668,"authorName":"Beth Fleming","from":"Beth Fleming &lt;momofwc@...&gt;","profile":"momofwc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New unschooling concerns/questions","postDate":"1221051116","msgId":35810,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NzI4LjI3MjUwLnFtQHdlYjMwMDA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35809,"nextInTopic":35811,"prevInTime":35809,"nextInTime":35811,"topicId":35806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"  My son is 9 and a half and is reading on his own now.....after being read to for MANY years.  He still loves to be read to, but two weeks ago, found an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1285226214\"> <br/>\nMy son is 9 and a half and is reading on his own now.....after being read to for MANY years.  He still loves to be read to, but two weeks ago, found an old b-day present (a book on codes.)  He curled up on the couch for a few hours and was reading it, and then came into the kitchen to me and announced ,&quot;I have to say, Mom, that I&#39;m really reading this book!&quot;  High interest, no pressure from me or anyone else.  Now he&#39;s also into the Captain Underpants books (so funny and 9 yo boyish humor!  I highly recommend them!) and reading them on his own, with the occasional &quot;what&#39;s this word?&quot;, which I tell him.  Just keep reading to your child and telling him words when he asks and if he&#39;s interested.  IMO, 6 is very young!!   It will come in its own time, and maybe not how or when you expect, but when your child is ready.  Have faith and trust.

If they want something done, like having their toys in an order they can cope with, than I am happy to help, or cooking some culinary creation that they dreamt up or desired. I&#39;ll even do the clean up. I figure I get to help make their childhoods joyful, I take<br/>\n that pretty seriously. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI have been unschooling/ homeschooling 2 boys (6yr and 4yr) for a<br/>\nlittle while now. We have tried the traditional homeschool approach<br/>\nand I am exhausted of arguing,pleading, threatening, bribing,coercing ,<br/>\nmy son to &#39;do his school&#39;. I saw a bright, curious, book loving boy<br/>\nbegin to become negative and distant, so unschooling seems very<br/>\nenticing to us.<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 6 your son isn&#39;t school age in many place and at 4 your youngest isn&#39;t mandatory school age anywhere I know (ooh, Northern Ireland has a compulsory school age of 4, so I&#39;m wrong). What so you think they require at such young ages that takes arguing, pleading, threatening, bribing and coercing? You haven&#39;t been unschooling if that is what it is taking. Unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; at its most basic, your list of manipulation argues that you are a long way from basic unschooling. It sounds like you&#39;ve been very intensive to have your son switch from joy to resentment so quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nMy son has no interest in learning how to read(maybe bruised by my<br/>\nprodding?) but would have me read to him all day? Does anyone have<br/>\nreaders that have just learned it this way? I am worried he will never<br/>\nlearn to read...<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n6 to never is a long, long drive. My son is 11 and he isn&#39;t a fluent reader yet. I know children who weren&#39;t fluent until they were 13 or older. And yet you cannot tell them from earlier readers. Maybe that isn&#39;t comforting. Maybe what you want to hear is that unschooling will give you a guaranteed reader by age x. Ther isn&#39;t a guarantee. School doesn&#39;t give you a guaranteed reader by age 18. Unschooling, I think, has a better track record. The difference is that in school you are labelled for not reading by a certain age, in unschooling the label isn&#39;t applied so there is no need to be limited by it. Unschooling can help you to see the glory in the non-reader. Simon listens in ways that I cannot. He pays intense attention to visual and audial information where I look for the written word. I have a really hard time listening to someone read a book, but he can be mesmerized by books on cd and knows exactly what is going on. Playing video games with him is<br/>\n really enlightening, he picks out the clue to the next step so much faster than I do while I try and pick the clue out from text or what I remember from the written word. And he remembers details from conversations that I didn&#39;t catch or don&#39;t remember, he listens. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot reading early is not a handicap. And 6 is early. Worrying about it and pressing and prodding for it just helps your son to feel like he is stupid or obstinate to not be reading yet. It won&#39;t get him reading any earlier than he&#39;s going to read without you worrying. Actually it might make it later, it might just make him feel like it is something too difficult and too awful and he just can&#39;t do it. Relax and read to him as much as he likes. What a treat for you. Simon prefers having Stephen Fry read to him these days. He can go on and on and on whereas my voice gives in after a few chapters. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":181419370,"authorName":"Michele James-Parham","from":"&quot;Michele James-Parham&quot; &lt;michele@...&gt;","profile":"elijahsmum6713","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: New unschooling concerns/questions","postDate":"1221019675","msgId":35807,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdhN2g2citsa2JjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdhN2VsaCt1cmJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35806,"nextInTopic":35809,"prevInTime":35806,"nextInTime":35808,"topicId":35806,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
