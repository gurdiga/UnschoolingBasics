I have a 4 yr old boy and a 6 yr old boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won&#39;t go into my entire history, but we did choose homeschooling after 1 year of public K5, adhd meds, etc. We are med free now (have been for just about a year).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 year old is our dynamo explorer and the reason for this post.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep the rest as short and to the point as I can. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight after dinner, I had my macbook on the kitchen table. The boys were finishing up their milk and I was doing a bit of scheduling for outings over the rest of the month. I reminded the boys to mind their milks because my computer was on the table. My husband called for me, I left the room for maybe 20 seconds and came back to milk poured on my computer. The 4 yr old said that the 6 yr old poured it on. I sent 6 to his room, did what I could with my computer (yes, I yelled, yes, I swore). I went upstairs to talk to him and he did admit that he poured it on on purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m at a loss this evening. My husband and I cannot for the life of us figure out WHY he would do that?! He understands that he is no longer permitted to use his computer, ipad, or any electronics (minus TV) at this point until we come to some sort of understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know things will be &quot;just fine&quot; and he will be very helpful without asking for quite a few days and then as he earns his privileges back, he will go back to misbehaving and getting into trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did apologize for what he did, I forgave him and apologized for getting so upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do i go from here?

The boys were finishing up their milk and I was doing a bit of scheduling for outings over the rest of the month.  I reminded the boys to mind their milks because my computer was on the table.  My husband called for me, I left the room for maybe 20 seconds and came back to milk poured on my computer.  The 4 yr old said that the 6 yr old poured it on.  I sent 6 to his room, did what I could with my computer (yes, I yelled, yes, I swore).  I went upstairs to talk to him and he did admit that he poured it on on purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m at a loss this evening.

Must say that this was<br/>\ndefinitely time when he and I really talked and<br/>\nconnected...mostly I just listened.  He had all my<br/>\nattention unless I had the baby with me.  That first<br/>\nyear when she was an infant - one year old was<br/>\nchallenging because he wanted just me and it was<br/>\ndifficult to meet both of their needs at once - we<br/>\nfinally did figure out ways that were acceptable most<br/>\nof the time.

The rest of the family is okay with<br/>\nusing the other side of the paper).  I wish so much I<br/>\ncould say what helped to get to this point.  Maybe<br/>\ntime or maturity?  I don&#39;t know.
