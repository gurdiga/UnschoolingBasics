There were important to him needs that  <br/>\nyour computer met. Maybe he needed the quiet of your room to be away  <br/>\nfrom everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that makes his decision okay. But if you head down the  <br/>\nroute of he&#39;s being mean, disrespectful, uncaring you&#39;ll drive a wedge  <br/>\nfurther between you. If someone yells at you for something you had  <br/>\ngood reasons for, do you feel like embracing them and wanting to do  <br/>\nbetter for them because you love them? Or, if you do do better next  <br/>\ntime, is it because you fear or dread the anger? Is that what you want  <br/>\nyour son to feel?<br/>\n<br/>\nSit him down and make it very very plain that he needs to ask before  <br/>\nhe uses your computer. Not with anger, but because you want to help  <br/>\nhim do better. Then ask him why he used it so you can help him come up  <br/>\nwith better choices for next time. He might not be able to articulate  <br/>\nit. He might be afraid to articulate his reason. (Be mindful of how  <br/>\nyou respond. If you respond in a way that suggests the truth is not  <br/>\nthe right answer, he will be motivated to hide the truth.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just don&#39;t think that is very polite or respectful.

If he&#39;s trampling over your feelings, either he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get how important it is to you -- and some kids develop  <br/>\nempathy later than others -- or *he* feels there are enough times he  <br/>\nfeels disrespected that it feels okay to step on your needs to meet his.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is making the other children feel like they want to do the same  <br/>\n&gt; because he is/does.

So he clings to it even more<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having personal space is more important to some people than others.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s part of their personality. Just like being an introvert. Or  <br/>\nloving cherry pie for your birthday over any cake ever made.  On my  <br/>\ncomputer, I get to decide the background and the settings. I can leave  <br/>\nwindows and projects open and they&#39;ll be just as I left them when I  <br/>\nreturn. If you have your own space you can decorate it with Renoir,  <br/>\nhave classical music playing. If other people invade, there will be  <br/>\nempty Coke cans tossed about, you&#39;ll find a Renoir stashed behind the  <br/>\ncouch and a World Cup poster up. The computer wasn&#39;t his to begin  <br/>\nwith. It is more like a play room where everyone&#39;s things are. But to  <br/>\nhim having his own private corner of the world that he can keep just  <br/>\nso might be very very important to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating \tbehavior...","postDate":"1279937587","msgId":44594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluRFFSUFdhOHJrZVl2TTZnMlNxVzFiK0FMd3FCRlRrem56c3FRU0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkyMWxhbit0MDByQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxdmQwbis4OGN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aTIxbGFuK3QwMHJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44593,"nextInTopic":44595,"prevInTime":44593,"nextInTime":44595,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *** I have a child that perceives control where there is none.

This need conflicted with a preference of yours. It<br/>\nlikely wasn&#39;t a personal affront to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to assume this child is older, possibly a teen. I am sorry that I<br/>\ncan&#39;t remember. Are you giving this child enough one on one attention? I<br/>\nknow that sometimes I short change my oldest when the littles are especially<br/>\nneeded. One of the ways she shows her unmet needs is by &quot;invading&quot; my space<br/>\nand crossing my boundaries. I give her attention, angry attention but she&#39;ll<br/>\ntake it if there is a deficit. I have to be really careful, especially<br/>\nduring stressful times.<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; To keep from taking my anger out on him I asked him to leave the room,<br/>\n&gt; which he did.

It is really awesome that you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t take it out on him. It wasn&#39;t his. Can you find a way to seperate him<br/>\nfrom what they did? A start might be to tell him how they treated you and<br/>\nhow you felt. Explain that you know he wasn&#39;t trying to be hurtful to you.<br/>\nApologize for hurting him if he felt pain.

I grew up with very<br/>\ngentle grandparents and life was fabulous. Grandfather was a musician,<br/>\nmathematician, philosopher and incredible thinker. Grandmother was the most<br/>\nloving soul I have met in my life and more my mother than my real mother. At<br/>\nsixteen, moved to my parents home. I didn&#39;t get along with my father and two<br/>\nyears of solid rebellion followed. To be fair to them, I guess they had no<br/>\nclue what to do with a grown up daughter suddenly entering their lives, and<br/>\nthey started seeing the cracks in the &#39;genius&#39; they thought I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to put a name to what was going on with me, I could call it feeling<br/>\njudged. They had decided what I was, and if I was any different from their<br/>\nimagination, something was wrong with me. I wasn&#39;t aware of it then, of<br/>\ncourse. I went to great extents to provoke people. Somewhere, I wanted to be<br/>\naccepted as I was, even if I was awful. I tried for a while playing the<br/>\ngenius and showcasing my &#39;failings&#39; as eccentricity - after all, aren&#39;t most<br/>\ngeniuses supposed to be a little crazy? Didn&#39;t work. It still hurt, because<br/>\nthey didn&#39;t think the &#39;failings&#39; were cool and I didn&#39;t see me as a genius.<br/>\nIt was like I was telling the world, &quot;You keep finding things that are wrong<br/>\nwith me anyway, so why should I try to be any better? I fix one and you come<br/>\nup with another&quot;. I saw myself in a world with so much to do and discover<br/>\nand I used to get really upset when I was involved with something and it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t matter to the parents and they focused on something peripheral that<br/>\nwas &#39;wrong&#39;. Like I was reading something about some intricate science<br/>\nexperiment (I just loved cool science stuff - not the genius brand<br/>\ncurriculums), and the mother would nag me for sitting so that the light<br/>\ndidn&#39;t fall well on the page or something or slouching over the book or<br/>\nsomething. It was like they saw tiny niggling things that were problems -<br/>\nfor them, not me - and never really cared what my passion was. I used to<br/>\nfeel insulted and unloved that they interrupted me when I was engrossed with<br/>\nsomething without even caring that they were interfering with my involvement<br/>\nin something I enjoyed and found important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may not be so with Kathleen, it just came alive in my mind as I read<br/>\nyour post. I felt like they would always find that little something<br/>\ninappropriate whatever I did and I guess I gave them reasons so I could<br/>\npretend to myself that I could win their approval, but didn&#39;t want it. I<br/>\nguess a hug would have gotten more miracles out of me than the most<br/>\nsensitive counselling but if by some error I got it, I&#39;d have fought it. I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have wanted to burst into needy tears and expose yet another<br/>\nvulnerability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose wounds go deep. I still have issues if I perceive someone as judging<br/>\nme. They may not even be doing it. All it takes to trigger me into those<br/>\ndistancing routines is for me to think someone is doing it. I&#39;ve been<br/>\nworking with this for ages, but I still &#39;slip&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, everyone&#39;s life story is different, but having lived what I think<br/>\nyou are describing with Kathleen in terms of deliberately offensive<br/>\nbehaviour, I wanted to share that there are vulnerabilities and needs under<br/>\nall that distancing. I think the more alone I felt, the more I pushed<br/>\neveryone away.

There is a TV and DVD player upstairs now, as well as the ones in the LR, so that if the kids want to watch something else they have that option.

How many kids do you have? I have 4 kids (9, 6, 3, 18 months) and we have 3 computers. We have two desk tops that are set up at a table next to each other. We also have a lap top that is set up in a private little room off the kitchen. My oldest will sometimes be on the computer from the time she gets up until time to go to bed. If somebody wants to play on the computer without being interrupted, we suggest that they use the laptop in another room so that they can be out of sight out of mind. The living room computers are mine and my husband&#39;s and are referred to as Mom&#39;s computer and Dad&#39;s computer (we have always been a two computer family). The laptop is our family computer. My two oldest girls have their own Nintendo DS&#39;s too. Here lately, each of my 3 older girls have been wanting a computer to themselves so my husband and I have been finding other things to do so each of the girls can have unfettered time on the computer. My 3 year old will lose interest after a while so I will try to get the older ones to let her have a turn first. That way they can wait until she loses interest. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have any kind of computer use agreement because we try to evaluate each situation based on the circumstances. If the person on the computer is doing something that is really important to them, then I will try to help the non-user find something else to do that is fun. I have to be actively involved to make it successful. If I suggest that they do something on their own, it isn&#39;t nearly as successful as when I volunteer to do something WITH them. There have been times that I have stepped in and volunteered to do something cool only to have the person on the computer volunteer to give it up to go do something with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI work from home and have to have computer access to do my work. I try to share as much as I can. I have found that my kids want to hog something because they are afraid that if they give it up, they won&#39;t get it back. We try to make sure that everyone feels like their computer time is valued. My husband got an ipod so he could check his e-mail and FB without having to interrupt the girls. We try to make sure that each of the kids feel like they get enough computer time. While I was composing this, my 3 year old wanted to watch her My Little Pony videos on Youtube. I stopped and was trying to go to the website but by the time I got there, she had lost interest and is now playing with her big sisters who had been watching Youtube videos on the other computer. Now they are off watching TV and playing with their DSs. Whenever somebody else takes a turn, we try to minimize the window so that they can come back to right where they were before. If I am in the middle of doing my work, I will minimize my window and let the kids have a turn.

We actually did get another computer but that seems to have made things worse!  :(  The eldest wants to be on the computer 18-20 hrs at a time.  Many times he is really cool and understanding about letting someone else use it, but he has this need lately to be on it all the time.  So we built another computer that is really good and he still wants to be on all the time....lol  It is making the other children feel like they want to do the same because he is/does.  It is frustrating to feel unable to talk to him about it because he says it is his choice and we are trying to force him to do something else.  So he clings to it even more. :(  I am not sure what exactly is the reason for this.  He watches movies, animae, uses photoshop and does everything on the computer.  He has access to a TV and DVD player so he could watch those things on the TV instead of the computer (giving someone else time), but he doesn&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to.  I know it is a control thing, (ie he wants to control the one computer 24/7) but I am having trouble discussing it with him, he immediately gets defensive.  I just want everyone to feel they are getting the time they need to play games, check email, upload stuff, work on photoshop, etc.  I really thought getting the 2nd computer would make it easier for everyone to share, but I am feeling the pinch of the higher electric bill and feeling grumpy and disrespected over just mentioning that someone else would like a chance to be online...Help!?!  Do I need to do a calendar or something?????  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279481177","msgId":44556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzODVGNzk1MjhDRDRCNzVBMEYzQTg3MERFMjFFMDAwQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxdjIxYStmbm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxdjIxYStmbm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44554,"nextInTopic":44559,"prevInTime":44555,"nextInTime":44557,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: IN Mom Sent: Sunday, July 18, 2010 9:10 AM To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1737832764\">From: IN Mom <br/>\nSent: Sunday, July 18, 2010 9:10 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Kathleen has been up all night and says she can&#39;t sleep.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is it that she can&#39;t sleep or is it that she is up because that is the only time that she can get to herself? I know my oldest will get up really early in the morning sometimes so she can have unfettered access to everything without her sisters butting in. There have also been times that she couldn&#39;t sleep because she wanted to talk to me. With four kids, the oldest sometimes gets lost in the shuffle. On nights when she can&#39;t sleep, I try to get up with her and talk to her. My oldest loves it when I rub her feet or her back when she can&#39;t sleep. It helps her relax and it helps us reconnect. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;She is working on making a CD using YouTube and Audacity on our family computer and the other kids want a turn. The usual policy (chosen by consensus) in our house is 30-minute turns when someone else is waiting.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My first reaction to 30 minute turns was &quot;How can anything be accomplished in 30 minutes?&quot; Youtube can sometimes be very slow when uploading. CD making can be very slow and time consuming and 30 minutes just doesn&#39;t seem like enough time. Perhaps you can suggest that the time for turns can be extended to an hour or so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Kathleen has her own laptop but prefers the desktop computer because the monitor is bigger and she won&#39;t let the others use her laptop.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I know Meredith suggested getting another computer. If you can&#39;t afford that, perhaps you can just get a bigger monitor that you can hook to her laptop. Sometimes you can get the old CRT monitors really cheap because people are getting rid of them. Is there some way to negotiate the use of her laptop. What do the other kids want to do on the computer? Are they playing games, using software, or using the Internet? Are there other things that you can get to help them accomplish what they want so that Kathleen can get more time on the desktop? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;When the other kids ask for a turn, she insults them and/or physically scratches them/shoves them away. If I ask her how long until she&#39;s ready to give someone else a turn, she says, &quot;4 hours.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How are the other kids asking for a turn? Are they being ugly to deliberately get their sister in trouble? My children will sometimes try to deliberately do little stuff to get a reaction out their siblings. When the sibling reacts, I only see the reaction rather than what led up to it. I don&#39;t know if that is happening but it is something that I have to watch for so that I can be more balanced in my approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be possible to negotiate 4 hour turns? When everyone is in a good place, perhaps you can sit down with all of the kids and discuss what each of them uses the computer for so that you can try to find alternatives through collective brainstorming. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I will try to give Kathleen lots more attention and provide more foods she likes. She is amazingly independent in lots of ways for her age, doing her own laundry, walking to stores on her own, cooking a lot of her own meals, typing up packing lists for trips, taking care of her pets...but maybe that leaves her feeling un-nurtured. We could make up a meal plan for the week in advance--maybe she would be more motivated to eat foods she requested.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t do meal plans but we try to take the kids with us to the store and let them pick things that they will eat. Before cooking dinner, I try to get some input as to what everyone is hungry for so that I can try to make sure that I cook something for everyone. Sometimes it is as simple as preparing an extra vegetable.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279473495","msgId":44554,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxdmQwbis4OGN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxdjIxYStmbm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44553,"nextInTopic":44556,"prevInTime":44553,"nextInTime":44555,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* Sometimes in the moment all solutions look ugly!

Whenever possible it helps to buy some time, any gentle way you can. Distract the other kids, somehow, commiserate that it sucks to wait when someone&#39;s been on the computer (or whatever) &quot;forever&quot;, and make plans to re-assess the whole issue at a later time. &quot;In the moment&quot; isn&#39;t the time to try to talk or reason with someone who&#39;s over-tired, over-stressed, and/or hormonal - do You want to be &quot;reasoned with&quot; in those circumstances? I don&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The usual policy (chosen by consensus) in our house is 30-minute turns when someone else is waiting.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about consensus is that not-working is the same as no consensus. The agreement has broken down. That&#39;s not inherently bad; like unschooling consensus operates under the assumption that there aren&#39;t any &quot;permanent solutions&quot;. Everything is renegotiable and not-working means its time to renegotiate the deal. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would Kathleen like to see happen when she wants the computer a lot longer than the 30-minute &quot;turns&quot; that y&#39;all have been using? It probably feels really stressful for her to have to give up what she&#39;s doing once she&#39;s solidly working on a project - which is probably why you got her the laptop in the first place ;) Shared resources can create a sense of limitation, which can lead to hoarding - that&#39;s why unschoolers suggest &quot;get another one&quot; any time its possible. Can you get another computer? Alternately, another something else - other portable game or console or dvd player? Even having something like that on a &quot;wish list&quot; can help cool tempers in the moment. Its also worth asking Kathleen if she&#39;ll negotiate terms for use of her laptop while she&#39;s busy with the desk computer - what are her concerns and can they be met somehow, maybe by parental supervision of whoever wants to use the device?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She is amazingly independent in lots of ways for her age...but maybe that leaves her feeling un-nurtured.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***********<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can! I know that was something I ran into a lot as a kid - I was so capable that I didn&#39;t tend to let people know when I wanted things like affection. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read anything about the Five Love Languages? Its a way of describing how people give and recieve affection - some people like words of love or compliments or gifts, while others like spending time together or doing favors. The thing is, if one person tends to prefer favors and the other words, it can be hard to communicate love, leading to questions like: Why do you keep saying &quot;I love you&quot; but don&#39;t take out the trash? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it can help to notice what your dd Does to show affection for other people and look for ways to do something similar. Acting independently can be one of the ways she expresses love - she&#39;s doing you the favor of taking care of herself. So doing little favors for her might be a way to express care that&#39;s more meaningful than, say, snuggling (although everyone needs all kinds of love, too, so snuggling isn&#39;t a bad thing ;))<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":394390467,"authorName":"IN Mom","from":"&quot;IN Mom&quot; &lt;laura.mcdonald523@...&gt;","profile":"lpmcdona","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279462250","msgId":44553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxdjIxYStmbm5rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxcWJlNitzZXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44549,"nextInTopic":44554,"prevInTime":44552,"nextInTime":44554,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for all of the great advice and ideas.

Not that you can do anything about that on the <br/>\nsurface, but perhaps what isn&#39;t factored in as you move away from a rule based <br/>\nhome is the time that each of them will need with you, with your partner, to <br/>\nfill the void of the rules. And with three children so close in age it may take <br/>\nmore effort than you are anticipating to achieve that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been few rules in our lives to remove, even so it takes a lot of my <br/>\nattention to make sure that Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s needs are met. Food is a more <br/>\nconstant call for my attention. I have to offer regularly, platters used to be <br/>\nquite handy, less so now, now they mostly want meals. A fair number of meals. It <br/>\ntakes knowing what they like and trying to have a fair range of things to hand <br/>\nand being willing to go and get the things they want when they aren&#39;t handy. Not <br/>\nimmediately, well sometimes not immediately. If Simon isn&#39;t eating alot, David <br/>\nor I will look for things that will appeal to him particularly. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEngagement is really important. As they&#39;ve grown older it takes much more effort <br/>\nby me to make sure that I&#39;m connecting with them.

And knowing that Kathleen needing 10 hours <br/>\na day and Kari needing 11 hours a day and Sean needing 13 hours a day that your <br/>\nare going to be spending a lot of time just hanging and doing and chatting and <br/>\nbeing with your children, all of your children together as well as each of them <br/>\nalone, well maybe it will help you to see more and more and more the points at <br/>\nwhich Kathleen, particularly, is floundering. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to someone about how they are hurting other people, well, it just makes <br/>\nthem feel worse. Linnaea used to get so angry and so frustrated and she would <br/>\nlash out. Heck, yesterday I got really angry and frustrated and I lashed out. <br/>\nAnd do you know the coolest thing, nobody lectured me, nobody told me how was <br/>\nmaking them hurt, or how they couldn&#39;t be having with my nonsense. D&#39;ya know <br/>\nwhat they did? They came and cuddled me, and held me. All of them, David, and <br/>\nSimon and Linnaea. They didn&#39;t run away from me, they didn&#39;t tell me to shut up <br/>\nand get on with things. And it worked. I moved from frustrated to fine so much <br/>\nmore quickly than I would have if they&#39;d told me off. And more than that, they <br/>\ntook the job that was too hard for me to do on my own, remembering the e-mail <br/>\naddress and password of Simon&#39;s xbox live account, and they solved it. I knew I <br/>\nwas being a jerk, I knew from that outside vision of myself that I was being <br/>\nunpleasant and mean and just needed to shut up. But they saw that I was unhappy <br/>\nand needed some loving. So, rather than telling her that what she&#39;s doing is <br/>\nharming all around her, try and see that what she&#39;s doing is about being needy <br/>\nand frustrated and not knowing how to cope. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my miserable moment I wasn&#39;t hoping that someone would impose limits or <br/>\npunishments on me, I just was frustrated. I wasn&#39;t working with some ulterior <br/>\nmotive, I just got overwhelmed. Don&#39;t assume that Kathleen is doing something in <br/>\na bid for structure or in a bid for rules. At best assume she needs more time <br/>\nand more attention and more love. At worst assume she&#39;s hungry or tired or <br/>\nthirsty and respond to those things as well as giving her more time and more <br/>\nattention and more love. And honestly, if what you laugh out loud about is the <br/>\nfact that what a psychiatrist is suggesting is puberty you believe has been <br/>\nthere always, maybe she&#39;s always neede more time and more attention and more <br/>\nlove. With a sibling one year her junior I imagine it&#39;s been hard for her to get <br/>\nall the love and attention she&#39;s needed anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m Laura with dh John, Kathleen (10), Kari (9), and Sean (7). We&#39;re going <br/>\nthrough a really tough time right now and could use your sage advice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always unschooled academically and want to go all the way with radical <br/>\nunschooling. However, we seem to run up against the same pattern of problems <br/>\nevery time we get close to our ideal lifestyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the cycle: First, we are living fairly happily with some rules but the <br/>\nkids and I want them to have more freedom and live more democratically. Next, we <br/>\ngradually let go of food guidelines, computer restrictions, bedtimes, etc. All <br/>\ngoes well for a period of weeks to a couple of months. Then, Kathleen starts <br/>\nexperimenting with extremes: not eating at all for a day or two, not sleeping <br/>\nfor 40 hours straight, drinking a gallon and a half of milk a day, or whatever. <br/>\nShe gets herself so sleep deprived or starved that she gets extremely irritable <br/>\nand starts picking fights with her siblings and other relatives. If we try to <br/>\ntalk to her about how she&#39;s hurting people or making it difficult for us to get <br/>\nto appointments, she gets really resentful and accuses us of threatening to take <br/>\naway her freedoms. She says she can&#39;t trust us, maybe we don&#39;t really love her, <br/>\nand generally acts like a stereotypical angry teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, the whole family life goes on a downward spiral until Kathleen is <br/>\ndeliberately upsetting everyone, ruining family vacations, and we (parents) <br/>\nresort to putting the old rules back in place. This cycle has been repeating <br/>\nsince Kathleen was a toddler! We try really hard to meet her needs, see things <br/>\nfrom her perspective, find ways to protect the siblings, offer her a wide <br/>\nvariety of activities to try, and so on. It seems like the more we offer <br/>\nunderstanding and acceptance, the worse Kathleen&#39;s behavior gets. She just keeps <br/>\nramping it up until we feel that we have to impose some structure to keep <br/>\neveryone safe. Somehow that seems to be her ultimate goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we see the same self-defeating pattern outside the family, too. For <br/>\nexample, when Kathleen makes a new friend, they have a great time for up to a <br/>\nfew weeks, then she decides the friend has some fatal flaw and cuts off the <br/>\nrelationship in a very hurtful way. One time she actually vandalized a public <br/>\nplace. After that episode, she did see a child psychiatrist for about 6 months. <br/>\nThe psychiatrist concluded that Kathleen doesn&#39;t have any mental illness, she&#39;s <br/>\njust working through some difficult puberty issues. As far as I can tell, <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been the same issues for the last 9 years, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could really use some suggestions about how to break the cycle we&#39;re in! <br/>\nKathleen is such a bright, funny kid. She is wonderful with small children and <br/>\nhas a real gift for training animals. I hate to see her hurting herself and the <br/>\npeople around her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279324943","msgId":44542,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0RUMzREFCMTJFOTQyMzY4QjFBMEQzN0FENzJEOTQ3QENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxcWJlNitzZXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkxcWJlNitzZXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44540,"nextInTopic":44546,"prevInTime":44541,"nextInTime":44543,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From: IN Mom Sent: Friday, July 16, 2010 2:20 PM To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-549798731\">From: IN Mom <br/>\nSent: Friday, July 16, 2010 2:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;At this point, the whole family life goes on a downward spiral until Kathleen is deliberately upsetting everyone, ruining family vacations, and we (parents) resort to putting the old rules back in place. This cycle has been repeating since Kathleen was a toddler! We try really hard to meet her needs, see things from her perspective, find ways to protect the siblings, offer her a wide variety of activities to try, and so on. It seems like the more we offer understanding and acceptance, the worse Kathleen&#39;s behavior gets. She just keeps ramping it up until we feel that we have to impose some structure to keep everyone safe. Somehow that seems to be her ultimate goal.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps she needs some structure. We have established a regular predictable pattern to our days. We don&#39;t have arbitrary rules or limits but there are some things that we have all decided that work for us as a family. We make sure to talk about what works when we are all in a good place. One of the things that works for us is going to bed as a family. For some reason, that seems to help everyone get regular sleep. Another consideration is to assess whether or not you are giving her too many choices and it is overwhelming her. When my kids start ramping things up, we try to find some time to do a lot of hanging out around the house. I pull them close and try to give them extra attention. Some kids are introverts and don&#39;t really want to travel or go lots of places. <br/>\n<br/>\nI took unschooling to the extreme for a while and it didn&#39;t work for my kids because I wasn&#39;t giving them enough feedback. I wasn&#39;t communicating with them enough. My oldest daughter saw my attempts at unschooling as me not caring. She thought I wasn&#39;t involved enough and didn&#39;t care any more. After all, every message that you hear in public or on the TV says that parents that love their kids give them rules. Every parent that loves their kids put restrictions on them. When one of her friends found out that I let her cuss, they told her that her mom didn&#39;t love her because good moms don&#39;t let their little girls cuss. That was a hard one for me to address but we fumbled through it by me being honest with her. I tried to explain my thoughts to her and tried to help her realize that every family is different. The lack of rules doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t love her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember how it came out but she told me that she felt like me letting her do whatever she wanted meant that I didn&#39;t love her. Since we interact with the rest of the world, she saw first hand how other parents restricted their children. She wondered why she was so different. I don&#39;t remember how it all played out but I had to sit down with her and talk to her about why we were doing what we were doing. She wanted more input from me. She wanted me to help her feel better. Part of that is to help her go to bed at night. She will be nine this weekend but she still sleeps in our room because she had bad dreams and couldn&#39;t sleep in her room. Now, she sleeps in our room and goes to bed when we do. She doesn&#39;t like being over tired so she looks to me for help. I try to help her find solutions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter isn&#39;t eating, I try to help her find things that she will like to eat. Sometimes, the problem is that she is craving something that we don&#39;t have but she doesn&#39;t want to ask me to get it for her because she knows I am busy with other stuff. Because she is the oldest, she tries to help me by not bugging me. We talk about it all the time but she sometimes gets lost in the shuffle and I forget to tell her that it is okay to ask me for stuff. Instead of waiting for her to ask, I have to remember to be proactive and make sure that she has everything that she might want or need. If I see that she isn&#39;t eating, I try to help her find something that she will eat even if that means offering to go get something or having her dad pick something up on the way home. Today, my girls were whiny and cranky and were picking fights with each other and were being miserable to me and to each other. They didn&#39;t want to eat anything we had in the house and, quite frankly, neither did I. We loaded up in the car and went to their favorite place to eat and got take out. The promptly ate it all and we all felt much better. Most of the times there is a trigger for the extreme behavior. I just have to figure out what it is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes we see the same self-defeating pattern outside the family, too. For example, when Kathleen makes a new friend, they have a great time for up to a few weeks, then she decides the friend has some fatal flaw and cuts off the relationship in a very hurtful way.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she talk to you about the flaws in her friends before she cuts off the relationship? I feel like I am constantly talking to my girls about relationships. Whenever I see my kids getting into a negative pattern, I check myself to see if I am modeling those same behaviors in my relationships. I get in weird patterns if I don&#39;t check myself. I can usually tell that I am veering off the path that I want to be on when my girls start exhibiting certain behaviors. The pattern with friends seems to mimic the relationship that you have with her. Everything is going great until you can&#39;t handle her extreme behavior. At that point, you start limiting things. Isn&#39;t that the same thing that she is doing with her friends? Things go great with the friend until things get too extreme for her and then she limits it by cutting it off. I may be way off because I don&#39;t know all of the dynamics. That is just another perspective or possibility to consider. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of just looking at her, you might look at other factors. Have her siblings been set up to have negative thoughts about their sister? Is this your oldest daughter? My oldest is a perfectionist and doesn&#39;t like to mess anything up. Every now and then she will get overwhelmed and start having extremes. I help her work it out by taking some time to spend with her without anybody else around. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to consider is whether or not she is making friends for herself or for you. I am an introvert and don&#39;t like having lots of friends. I am overly sensitive and feel safest at home or in situations where I can be my uncensored self. Having friends gets to be too much work after a while so I tend to pull away. Having said all that, there is a huge pressure for kids (and adults) to socialize and have friends. If she is an introvert, she could be finding negative things about her friends so she doesn&#39;t have to do all of the work involved in having a friend. People don&#39;t seem to understand when somebody just doesn&#39;t have a huge desire to be overly social.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279321516","msgId":44540,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxcW9qYytjdGQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkxcWJlNitzZXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44536,"nextInTopic":44542,"prevInTime":44539,"nextInTime":44541,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I get good and stuck on something, I like to try coming at the question from a different direction.

What if what your dd is doing isn&#39;t &quot;self defeating&quot; at all? What if she&#39;s actually trying to explore something? Its not a terrible thing to explore extremes, when they&#39;re just things like food and sleep - but it could be terrible for her to explore extremes as an adult (or teen for that matter) when the extremes can be a whole lot more extreme! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trouble could be this:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If we try to talk to her about how she&#39;s hurting people or making it difficult for us to get to appointments, she gets really resentful and accuses us of threatening to take away her freedoms. She says she can&#39;t trust us, maybe we don&#39;t really love her<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom her perspective, she&#39;s got a point - you Are going to take away her freedoms if she doesn&#39;t toe the line, after all, you&#39;ve done it before. She *can&#39;t* trust you in that sense. You&#39;re not helping her get what she wants, you&#39;re throwing up roadblocks. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, but what about her being unfriendly to other people? I didn&#39;t forget that part, I&#39;m trying to see it from another angle. What if the question isn&#39;t &quot;how can we transition to unschooling without Kathleen going to extremes&quot;? What if you start with experimenting with extremes as a given? It Is a given for some kids. So if that&#39;s a given, the question becomes: How do you create a safe environment in which Kathleen can experiment with extremes? Safe for others as well as for her?<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a different problem to solve, one it would be good to ask for her input on right from the start: &quot;We Want to do this, we know you want to experiment, and we need to find a way to do that which works for All of Us.&quot; Do some brainstorming with her, with your dh, with your other kids, too. Maybe not all together as a group, maybe one at a time - that&#39;s going to depend on y&#39;all. You don&#39;t want to frame the one kid as the &quot;badguy&quot; the one who keeps it all from working - that won&#39;t help her or the rest of you. Frame it as &quot;she has this need, and we want to help her get it without all of us going bonkers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee if she&#39;ll make some deals with you ahead of time, like that she agrees to take vitamins. It won&#39;t be a perfect thing, but it will help with moodiness. Do some research with her ahead of time into things like fasting - what do people who fast do to make sure they don&#39;t hurt themselves? Look up stories of holy people from different religions and cultures to give all y&#39;all some context for what she&#39;s doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother set of agreements ahead of time could be that, if she&#39;s especially irritable and hard to get along with, she stays home or keeps more to herself. Its important that this not be some kind of punishment, and that&#39;s why its important to talk about it beforehand. The middle of a crisis is the Worst time to talk about how everyone Else is unhappy, if you see what I mean?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;This cycle has been repeating since Kathleen was a toddler!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a big need in there that&#39;s getting missed somehow. What is she like when &quot;all the rules&quot; are in place? Is she a perfectionist? An idealist? I&#39;m *guessing* (and its a big guess, since I have just this post to go on) that she&#39;s kind of an extremist in some way and doesn&#39;t often get to &quot;play&quot; with that - okay, and maybe I&#39;m projecting because that was me as a kid. I had extreme passions, but I was also basically a &quot;good girl&quot; a people pleaser, so I kept most of that locked down most of the time. I couldn&#39;t *keep* it down, so now and then I&#39;d do something outrageous and everyone would say &quot;I don&#39;t understand... she&#39;s such a good girl.&quot; That was a cycle that went &#39;round and round until I was...er...  thirty something. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (who&#39;s just past thirty something this year ;))</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":394390467,"authorName":"IN Mom","from":"&quot;IN Mom&quot; &lt;laura.mcdonald523@...&gt;","profile":"lpmcdona","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Help! 10 yo with self-defeating behavior...","postDate":"1279308038","msgId":44536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkxcWJlNitzZXI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44540,"prevInTime":44535,"nextInTime":44537,"topicId":44536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I m Laura with dh John, Kathleen (10), Kari (9), and Sean (7).

Next, we gradually let go of food guidelines, computer restrictions, bedtimes, etc. All goes well for a period of weeks to a couple of months. Then, Kathleen starts experimenting with extremes: not eating at all for a day or two, not sleeping for 40 hours straight, drinking a gallon and a half of milk a day, or whatever. She gets herself so sleep deprived or starved that she gets extremely irritable and starts picking fights with her siblings and other relatives. If we try to talk to her about how she&#39;s hurting people or making it difficult for us to get to appointments, she gets really resentful and accuses us of threatening to take away her freedoms.
