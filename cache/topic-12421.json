Before unschooling he was begging me to see them, but I didn&#39;t want to allow it since they were &quot;PG-13.&quot;  He even went so far as to READ the novelizations.  One of the first things I did when I pulled him out of school was allow him to see them (I just went ahead and bought them since I knew they would be favorites of his)...it was like Christmas had come early. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bonus features are really cool, aren&#39;t they?  Tristan spent so much time looking through the various sections.  There are times when I&#39;ve bought a movie more for its bonus features than anything else.  Another favorite here when it comes to bonus material is &quot;National Treasure&quot; with Nicholas Cage.  It has a section dealing with cryptography (and deciphering hieroglyphics, I believe).<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nomadicdreamers.blogspot.com/\">http://nomadicdreamers.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Christy Putnam <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am amazed!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Seth (11) has been watching the Mummy and Mummy returns over and over and<br/>\n  over the last few months.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223344266,"authorName":"Christy Putnam","from":"&quot;Christy Putnam&quot; &lt;personal_balance@...&gt;","profile":"personal_balance","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"The Mummy and The Mummy Returns DVD&#39;s","postDate":"1145915099","msgId":12421,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMjEwMWM2NjdlOCQ1NjE3NzdkMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12436,"prevInTime":12420,"nextInTime":12422,"topicId":12421,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am amazed!

Of course he goes on to other things as kids will<br/>\nbut it is like an obsession with him...(not complaining)...I have seen the<br/>\nMummy but the Mummy Returns is not something I was interested in watching<br/>\nbut my dh has seen it and said there weren&#39;t parts he would think Seth would<br/>\nhyper focus on and get scared or freaked out (that is pretty much our<br/>\nguideline in his movie selections).  ANYWAY, generally when it comes to<br/>\nmovies I don&#39;t want to see (or have seen and don&#39;t wanna watch over again) I<br/>\njust let him do his thing w/o feeling like I need to be in the room.  I<br/>\nwalked by a minute ago and he was looking through the bonus features on the<br/>\nDVD of the Mummy and it is like an Egyptian history lesson!  It is called<br/>\nEgyptology 101...it goes through some of the gods, artifacts, immortals,<br/>\nplagues, a map of Egypt...I mean really neat stuff.  He said that on the<br/>\nMummy Returns there is even more stuff!  now I am not any more interested in<br/>\nseeing the movies but I DO want to see those bonus features!  How cool is<br/>\nthat?  he has always been interested in that stuff but who&#39;da thunk he would<br/>\nfind some of that info on bonus features of a DVD?  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust had to share...lol<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIn Gratitude,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nUnschooling Mom to Aden (1) and Seth (11)<br/>\nLoving wife of Chet (ann. 7/4/04)<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go confidently in the direction of your<br/>\ndreams.
