At this point we are looking at everyone having their own. My brother in law has his own he brought with him, hubby and I each have one, the kids are sharing. However, I will have the opportunity to get a notebook when my financial aid for school comes through and my daughter will get mine. My son is not quite 4 but loves playing his games. My daughter spends quite a bit of time reading, watching her favorite shows, gaming and researching &quot;neat&quot; things.<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy C.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Brad Holcomb &lt;list.brad@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 9, 2008 8:59:20 AM<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: X-Post: Sharing is Caring<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have <br/>\n&gt;2 computers, 2 self-employed adults and 2 self-schooled children at <br/>\n&gt;home most of the day - and many other children in and out.

With decent computers available from Dell<br/>\nand other vendors for &lt;US$400 these days, would it be possible for you to<br/>\nbuy 1 or 2 more?  I personally see availability of the internet as very<br/>\nimportant, so I already got a cheap hand-me-down computer for my 3 y/o son.<br/>\nHe was wanting to watch youtube videos and other things on mom and dad&#39;s<br/>\ncomputers.  Mine is essential for business (I&#39;m an IT contractor, so without<br/>\na working computer I can&#39;t do billable work) so I didn&#39;t want to risk him<br/>\nbreaking something on mine.  And my wife didn&#39;t like him being on hers when<br/>\nshe wanted to use it, and got frustrated when I would tell him &quot;I&#39;m working,<br/>\nso go use mom&#39;s&quot;.  It was a week or 2 of drama that got nipped in the bud<br/>\nquickly as soon as the new PC arrived.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 months ago, my thinking was that we would need to get him one in the &quot;next<br/>\ncouple years&quot;.  I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d want one at 3.<br/>\n-=b.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\nhttp://holcombs. org<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35769,"nextTopicId":35761}}
