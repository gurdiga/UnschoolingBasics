I think you&#39;ve <br/>\nreally<br/>\ngotten to the core of the issue when you point to the need to control<br/>\nthe situation over the emotional well-being.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do say &quot;words please&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t help you if I don&#39;t know what you<br/>\nneed&quot;--depending upon how many words *from me* I think the child can<br/>\nprocess. In part, it is about me wanting to control the situation--<br/>\ni.e.<br/>\nhelp fix what ever&#39;s wrong. But, also, I think it probably ties into<br/>\nthat emotional need for myself to be able to make things right. Not<br/>\nalways the purest motivation, as we&#39;ve talked about before here at <br/>\nAU.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;ll do is remind them to breathe--another good <br/>\nstrategy<br/>\nfor calming and regaining access to language.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis conversation has me reconsidering whether calming and fixing are<br/>\nreally the best reactions on my part, wondering whether empathy first<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be a better approach. Lots of food for thought and a great<br/>\nreminder to be more mindful of my own reactions in these situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory, I agree empathy first is a great approach, but practically<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s that easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, it&#39;s kinda hard to empathize without understanding. Of course,<br/>\nthere can be pure love without understanding, but often when a child <br/>\nis<br/>\nwanting empathy, what they&#39;re needing is precisely that<br/>\nunderstanding--another human being who can say, I understand, I get <br/>\nit,<br/>\nwhich validates the emotions and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, not all kids in all situations are going to want empathy <br/>\nfirst.<br/>\nSometimes fixing it really is what they want--and NOW! I have totally<br/>\nbeen on the receiving end of a<br/>\n&quot;make-it-better-now-or-you&#39;re-completely-useless-to-me!&quot; attitude <br/>\nthat&#39;s<br/>\nborn of pure frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t have kids who want to hit pillows--that&#39;s just never <br/>\nbeen a<br/>\nuseful strategy for us. *shrug* Even Sam, who can really rage, has <br/>\nnever<br/>\nwanted or accepted redirection for his anger, and we&#39;ve brainstormed <br/>\n*a<br/>\nlot* and tried lots of different possibilities. He pretty much justs<br/>\nwants to discharge in his own way--not hitting a pillow, or a couch, <br/>\nor<br/>\na bed, just pure raging. Getting him into his room where he can <br/>\nthrow,<br/>\nhit, bang, whatever, in these moments has been what works best for<br/>\nus--Sam can release and move through his intense emotions more <br/>\nquickly<br/>\nwhile everyone and everyone&#39;s things stay safe. Of course, I&#39;m not<br/>\ntelling him to use his words in these situations either. ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: thank you thank you Ren","postDate":"1177256288","msgId":23346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYwZnZoMCs4MmtpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYwZWJ1NSt0c29wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23344,"nextInTopic":23347,"prevInTime":23345,"nextInTime":23347,"topicId":23336,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... just seems to be a good ...
