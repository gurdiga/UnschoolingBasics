He is an amazing kid...and <br/>\nhe takes a lot out of me.  But...somehow it all seems to work out <br/>\nbetter when I acknowledge and honor his unique personality and <br/>\ntemperament, while gently trying to balance the need to guide him in <br/>\na world that does not revolve around him.  LOL.  I think one <br/>\nimportant thing I had to remember, especially when the baby came, <br/>\nwas that he still was ONLY a young child.  We often have great <br/>\nexpectations of the older one when the little one comes along...you <br/>\nare older...you should/shouldn&#39;t be doing this...when they are still <br/>\nyoung, and learning their way in the world.  I do sympathize with <br/>\nyou.  Again, being pregnant while mothering any young child is <br/>\nchallenging (remember the long restful days of your first <br/>\npregnancy?....sigh).  Take care....try to rest....<br/>\nOh...I remember I had a thought....how about making some things <br/>\nreally accessible for her so she can &quot;help herself&quot; to things she <br/>\nmight need...ie: snacks on a low shelf, juice boxes, water bottles, <br/>\nand other quick foods in the refrig on a low shelf she can <br/>\nreach...just a thought.  And if she wants it...she can get it.  <br/>\nOh...and as far as the TV situation...do you guys rent video&#39;s?  <br/>\nSometimes those are a nice break from TV shows and you can have fun <br/>\npicking things out together.

I don&#39;t think moms just<br/>\nstoically tolerating abusive behavior while trying their best to help a<br/>\nchild is modelling what the parents want to model to their children.  If our<br/>\nchildren learn to read, clean house, be helpful people by watching us model<br/>\nthose behaviors....don&#39;t they learn to tolerate abuse by watching us<br/>\ntolerate abuse?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying to be abusive back, but to gently, firmly stand up to abuse<br/>\nand model for the child how to handle situations where one party is being<br/>\nabusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy now 5yo, Dan, can get abusive.  He can be wonderfully sweet and gentle<br/>\nand at other times, he yells, kicks, calls names, etc..  We talk during calm<br/>\ntimes about how people don&#39;t like to do things for people who are being mean<br/>\nto them, that people can&#39;t always even understand what he wants if he is<br/>\nbeing mean, etc..  I use people because Dan also gets abusive with his<br/>\nsiblings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought long and hard about how to handle this.  I didn&#39;t want to punish<br/>\nhim....I didn&#39;t want to model tolerating abuse...I couldn&#39;t allow him to be<br/>\nabusive to his siblings.

I had two accomplishments with this today: 1) a friend of<br/>\nmy dh&#39;s was here. He had his 5 year old son visiting with my daughter and<br/>\nwas taking their picture with his digital camera. As soon as he saw me he<br/>\nprepared to take my picture. I turned my back and said no thank you. He<br/>\npersisted and persisted thinking he could cajole me into it. I stood my<br/>\nground without getting mad and didn&#39;t give in which causes me resentment.<br/>\nFinally I just left the room and said I didn&#39;t want my picture taken and I<br/>\nwould stay away unless he respected my wishes. He agreed and that was the<br/>\nend of it. I felt fantastic. I have always hated having my picture taken,<br/>\nused to completely forbid it for year when I was a punk and didn&#39;t care what<br/>\nothers thought, eventually went to the other extreme and started letting<br/>\npeople cause they couldn&#39;t understand and ended up resentful. That was cool<br/>\nfor me. And 2)dd was watching a bed time show upstairs. I said I didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto watch cartoons and would be downstairs and if she wanted something to<br/>\nplease come to me, don&#39;t just call for me to come to her (big flight of<br/>\nstairs) well a few minutes later she is hollering for me, I used to get up<br/>\nand scream at her to come to me and we would end up in conflict. Tonight I<br/>\njust ignored her. She didn&#39;t come down, I ignored the voice that said she<br/>\nhad probably hurt herself and was lying upstairs in a pool of blood and much<br/>\nlater went up to do something else and then check on her. What did she want?<br/>\nShe just didn&#39;t want to be alone upstairs. I told her she could come see me<br/>\nanytime and again no resentment. It felt good. Maybe I am getting somewhere!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So what has changed if you didn&#39;t have many rules before?  Is it that<br/>\nbefore if she acted like that after you said no and sat down that you would<br/>\nhave given her a time out and now you don&#39;t?  Tantrums can be difficult to<br/>\nwatch, but there is an alternative to just no too.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell we are more relaxed about TV (talked about that in another post so<br/>\nwon&#39;t repeat) and generally I am just more tired and have less energy and I<br/>\nspend more time sitting than I used to. I think that might be it. For awhile<br/>\nmy lap top was in the living room and when ever I sat down I was on it I<br/>\nnoticed that not long after she asked for the TV... like if I was on the<br/>\ncomputer she would be on the TV. Moved the TV now in preparation for the<br/>\nbaby, and will go back to some controls on the TV and see where we get.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think if you can nip these things in the bud and avoid the tantrum it<br/>\nwould be best.  As you get better at seeing potential problems ahead of time<br/>\nit&#39;ll be easier.  I exercise in the basement every morning.  Sometimes I ask<br/>\nmy kids if they want me to get them something before I go down.  Other times<br/>\nI just know they&#39;ll be hungry and I just bring a couple things to the living<br/>\nroom for them to eat and drink if they get hungry.  I make sure they are all<br/>\nsettled in so I have less of a chance of getting interrupted.  They have<br/>\nchanged their minds in the past and so I try to be aware that they might not<br/>\nknow they are going to get hungry soon and plan for that myself.  I even<br/>\npour drinks and put them in the fridge or on the arm of the couch next to<br/>\nthem. (just in case)  Try to remember when she last ate and plan<br/>\naccordingly.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes you are right. I am very emotionally reactive and reflect the emotions<br/>\nthat are around me, so it makes it hard to feel all her emotions flowing out<br/>\ntowards me and to disengage from it. I am SO much better at that than<br/>\nbefore, but have a longer way to go. Today I just selected a snack when I<br/>\nthought she would be hungry and cut it up and put it out and she ate it. I<br/>\nthink perhaps she is overwhelmed with the choices sometimes and doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nbeing asked what she wants to eat and prefers just having good food<br/>\nappearing. I will have to expand my food choices too then to accommodate<br/>\nthis.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Another option would be to tell her &quot;yes&quot; you&#39;ll get something for her, in<br/>\na few minutes.  (Maybe next commercial)  You might even suggest she get a<br/>\nstring cheese (or whatever) out of the fridge to hold her over till you get<br/>\nher something.  My kids at that age didn&#39;t like to do for themselves in the<br/>\nfood department.   They just plain liked to be waited on and I didn&#39;t mind,<br/>\nas long as they were a little patient with me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, to this too! Although sometimes she is down right thrilled that she can<br/>\njust help herself to her own food and doesn&#39;t have to wait for me and other<br/>\ntimes hates doing it for herself LOL. But yes it might have to become &quot;yes&quot;<br/>\nwith conditions, especially with the new baby coming.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is she getting all the rest she needs?  No bedtime to me isn&#39;t about just<br/>\nwaiting till they fall down in their tracks exhausted.  It&#39;s about watching<br/>\ntheir body signals and going to bed when they are tired instead of at some<br/>\nset time.  I still lie down with my girls while they go to sleep so sleep<br/>\nisn&#39;t something that is seen as terrible.  They don&#39;t feel like they are<br/>\nmissing anything and they feel secure and safe.  Provide snacks often if she<br/>\ngets hungry often.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe generally sleeps 10-11 hours a night. Asleep around 9 and up at 7 or 8,<br/>\nso I don&#39;t think there is a shortage there. She seems to not recognize the<br/>\nsigns of fatigue though any better than the signs of hunger. I will just<br/>\nkeep talking about how I feel during these times and hope she gets it. She<br/>\nis a lot like her dad there.<br/>\n <br/>\nI might still get the book, and be more aware of how I projecting my<br/>\nboundaries. It feels so weird for someone who hasn&#39;t established them<br/>\nbefore, even the littlest amount of expressing them feels like overkill<br/>\nsometimes. But as with all else I will keep working on it,<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-lee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097542507","msgId":3512,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJNUcwMDU1WTU3V1UwQGwtZGFlbW9uPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDEwLjE4MjAyMC4yMjA0LjUuZGR6aW1sZXdAanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3511,"nextInTopic":3516,"prevInTime":3511,"nextInTime":3513,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Deb, Thank you.

You are so right. I am 9 months pregnant and exhausted and to be<br/>\nhonest, just want to curl up in a ball most of the day and sleep just can&#39;t<br/>\nseem to get enough. Thanks to other posts on the list, today I started<br/>\ntalking to her more about how I am feeling (although I think she has heard<br/>\n&quot;I am tired&quot; enough these days) and then telling her what I need, like a nap<br/>\netc. Today she is being so understanding and cooperative and supportive that<br/>\nI could cry over the things I said about her the other day. We talked about<br/>\nhow she is feeling about the baby coming. She doesn&#39;t seem to be very<br/>\narticulate about her emotions, but that is no surprise her dad isn&#39;t and I<br/>\nstruggle to have the words, because my emotions have always been expressed<br/>\nin action in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh is not &quot;older older&quot; I remember the post I wrote that in... he 51 and<br/>\nI just tease about him being so much older than me, but sadly he isn&#39;t THAT<br/>\nmuch older:) And in the last month he has been so terrific for me and her.<br/>\nHe is available for her almost all the time, spends more time with her now<br/>\nthan ever and encourages me to rest and get naps etc. So I can&#39;t complain<br/>\nabout him at all right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes unschooling means not schooling. And yes she is not of school age and if<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t think or talk about unschooling, then we would be doing nothing<br/>\ndifferent. But I can&#39;t get over how everyone else is. Makes me want to be a<br/>\nrecluse to be honest sometimes. Today at brunch my mom started grilling her<br/>\non how to print her numbers. She is 4 for goodness sake. So at first she did<br/>\nher best and then when one came she didn&#39;t know she looked at me and said &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know&quot; and she HATES not knowing or being able to do something, she is<br/>\nVERY fragile that way. And I smiled at her and winked and said &quot;and you<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to know how to do any of them right now&quot; my mom shut up:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to bring the TV back under some control I see that, it has been a<br/>\ngreat tool while pregnant and perhaps it will be again after the baby is<br/>\nhere. She is resistant to anything that isn&#39;t cartoons, and yet is bored of<br/>\nthem... I will have to try to introduce some new things to watch I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that I think I should just forget about schooling, preschooling,<br/>\nhomeschooling, unschooling and enjoy being 4 with no expectations of<br/>\nschooling at this point. I will just smile and ignore all the people who ask<br/>\nas if you are some sort of freak to not be enrolled in preschool or<br/>\nkindergarten at this age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your thoughts, I will remember what you said... I know she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean this or do it intentionally to get to me, she is not malicious<br/>\nand I can handle it when I am not feeling attacked like you say but as soon<br/>\nas I start to feel that way it all falls apart.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure the dynamic of my mom and sister had something to do with it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Deb Lewis [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ddzimlew@...\">ddzimlew@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 10, 2004 5:20 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi Sherri-Lee,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry things are so hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been away from the list some, behind on posts a lot so I went to<br/>\nthe archives to see if I could read a bit about what you&#39;ve written<br/>\npreviously about your daughter.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097541684","msgId":3511,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJNUcwMEw3SjRMMjcxQGwtZGFlbW9uPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDEwMjMxNDMzLktNQVIxNzg2LmltZjE5YWVjLm1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldEBtYWlsLmJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3510,"nextInTopic":3512,"prevInTime":3510,"nextInTime":3512,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Michelle, Thanks for your reply, it gave me a lot to think about.

I am going to<br/>\nrespond through out, so I will put what you said in quotations and mine<br/>\nwithout.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have very few rules in our house.  Number one rule is that we respect<br/>\neach other and each other&#39;s spaces.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have this as well, including body space. It is when I have stated the<br/>\nrequest and explained that I am not feeling respected and she keeps going<br/>\nand going that I feel myself getting angry. I can not remove myself from the<br/>\nroom as this causes her to become hysterical and even more grabby, needy of<br/>\nme. This happens with words, tone of voice as well as physical body. So how<br/>\ndo you make someone be respectful of your wishes, when you have clearly<br/>\nstated them and do all you can to enforce them and still nothing changes?<br/>\nThis is where I am stumped. I guess I feel like I have no ultimate thing<br/>\nthat will ensure I get my wishes respected. I hope that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Just reading what you have written speaks to me that your daughter used to<br/>\nhave very set boundaries and then suddenly there were no boundaries and she<br/>\nmay feel lost.  She sees &quot;yes&quot; as &quot;everything my way or I make everyone<br/>\nmiserable&quot; rather than realizing that other people exist in the her world<br/>\nand if she wants people to be want to do things for her and with her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe had set boundaries before to an extent. We turned off the TV when I said<br/>\nso for example. And now it more up to her although I will remind of<br/>\ncommitments or encourage it to go off in favour of other activities. And yes<br/>\nshe really does seem to have begun to see every yes as everything is her way<br/>\nor I make the world miserable... so what do I do with that? I started saying<br/>\nyes more, simply because I was finding her resistant and uncooperative to<br/>\ndoing what we asked of her, and I thought from reading here that if I<br/>\nstarted to model joyfully doing the things she asked for that she would<br/>\nfollow suit. Now it has worked in some regards but it has had the opposite<br/>\neffect in other areas. Having said that I see that part of the problem the<br/>\nother day was hunger on her part, but she steadfastly refused to eat. Any<br/>\nsuggestion that he mood might have had something to do with hunger was<br/>\ngreeted with a shouted &quot;NO&quot; and an angrier child.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is she an only child?  Who does she play with on a daily/weekly basis?<br/>\nDoes she have a peer group, siblings, cousins?  Do you have a local<br/>\nhomeschool or resource group that you meet with on a regular basis?  Are<br/>\nthere friends in the neighborhood that she can play with who are<br/>\nhomeschooled or who are free to come play after school and on weekends?<br/>\nHave you talked to her about how you are feeling abused and come to a<br/>\nnegotiation of what is acceptable for all of you.  Obviously being her sole<br/>\nsource of entertainment isn&#39;t working for you and you need to work together<br/>\nto find other sources of entertainment or ways for her to entertain<br/>\nherself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is an only child, for now... I think I might be in early labour as we<br/>\nspeak:) She is a very social child and does get me out more than I would on<br/>\nmy own because of it. Everyday that it is nice I take her to a park to play<br/>\nwhere she meets kids. She is very outgoing and will approach children she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know and introduce herself and ask if they want to play with her.<br/>\nShe goes to music class once a week with good friends and to the park after.<br/>\nWe have a homeschool field trip group we go on once a week with friends as<br/>\nwell. Plus she has gymnastics weekly. We live in a rural area and all our<br/>\nneighbours are older without small kids her age. We have no family near by<br/>\nwith kids for her to play with. I try to get her and one of her friends<br/>\ntogether another time a week, but that is harder now that their schedule has<br/>\nchanged and I am so tired. I have a 15 year old who comes in weekly JUST to<br/>\nplay with her. Her father comes away from his home office most mornings to<br/>\nwrestle and play with her when we get up. He plays with her frequently<br/>\nduring the day. I wouldn&#39;t say I am her sole source of entertainment or that<br/>\nshe is without social stimulation, she is just in this place where if she<br/>\nisn&#39;t awake, she wants constant attention. It might have something to do<br/>\nwith the baby coming, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I raised my children with gentle guidance.  I subscribe to a very AP style<br/>\nof parenting.  That doesn&#39;t mean that there are no rules and no &quot;nos.&quot;  Not<br/>\nbecause I feel that children &quot;need&quot; nos but because yeses don&#39;t always work<br/>\nor are appropriate.   For instance a &quot;totally chocolate dinner&quot; isn&#39;t sound<br/>\nnutrition (although I&#39;m working on it LOL!)  and the kids can&#39;t go play out<br/>\nin the street (for obvious safety reasons).  Sometimes I don&#39;t have the<br/>\nenergy to be able to do that one last project or am busy with household<br/>\nactivities (floors need to be washed and bills do need to be paid<br/>\nperiodically) and so a &quot;no&quot; or a &quot;later&quot; is the answer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also practiced the AP lifestyle from day one. Co-sleeping, extended<br/>\nnursing, gentle discipline etc etc although I have not been perfect with<br/>\nthat given some of my personal issues, but I have never stopped trying or<br/>\nworking on it. This is not completely new for her. It just seems to have<br/>\nescalated since this summer when I started being more aware of unschooling.<br/>\nIt used to be that I would say &quot;no I am doing the wash, want to help me?&quot;<br/>\nand she would say yes, now she says &quot;BORING! Please turn on the TV for me&quot;<br/>\nor she would have just gone and played with her toys in the toy room which<br/>\nis right off the kitchen while I was puttering. But not since she has<br/>\ndiscovered the use of TV as distraction. And I really think that is part of<br/>\nwhat we have to do... reinstate those limits on TV. Last night as we<br/>\nprepared thanksgiving dinner and all the adults were busy, she wanted<br/>\nsomeone to play with her. So I suggested she watch a show (30 minutes) while<br/>\nshe wait for dinner and she said, no that is too boring. Twice now she has<br/>\nreferred to TV as boring and not wanting to do it, but she seems to have<br/>\nlost her ability to self amuse in what ever small amount she had before. Any<br/>\nhints on how to help her get that back? Plus, to be honest, with the baby<br/>\ncoming, I was sort of assuming that there would be MORE TV time as a way to<br/>\nget us through the first few weeks, although I have good back up help in<br/>\nplace, it won&#39;t cover all day.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I think before abandoning the entire &quot;unschooling lifestyle&quot; that you can<br/>\nre-evaluate what parts are and aren&#39;t working for you.  It may be that your<br/>\ndaughter needs a bit more structure or guidelines to work with.  She may be<br/>\nfeeling like a toddler and trying to figure out what her boundaries are and<br/>\nis confused because she doesn&#39;t seem to have any or they are very<br/>\ninconsistant.  Families have to work as a whole and that includes the<br/>\nparents.  If she isn&#39;t treating you with respect as a person (not just as<br/>\nher parent) then something isn&#39;t working for all of you.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I think you are right. Every time we have encountered this sort of<br/>\ngrowth curve, it has led back to her feeling too free and floundering. As<br/>\nsoon as I reinstated some of the boundaries, her equilibrium seem to be<br/>\nrestored. However we have never had her completely unwilling to play on her<br/>\nown before so that is a new dimension.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all your thoughts and insight, they have really helped me,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65428400,"authorName":"Virginia Glasser","from":"&quot;Virginia Glasser&quot; &lt;virginia@...&gt;","profile":"vlatheist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097511832","msgId":3510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5JQkJMREdIS0xDRUJMQU9ERkZLQ0VJTkNNQUEudmlyZ2luaWFAYXBvbGxvd2Vid29ya3MuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDExMTUxOTU2LkIwNjc3MTQwNzdGNEBwb3N0b2ZmaWNlLm9tbmlzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":3509,"nextInTopic":3511,"prevInTime":3509,"nextInTime":3511,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh and something I wanted to add, so I ll just add it here.

You are right, follow your heart, I just have a hard time<br/>\nhearing<br/>\n  my own heart sometimes and knowing what is best/right. Or when I do think<br/>\nI<br/>\n  do, then I doubt and second guess myself too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My daughter is 4.5. So of course I remember that the half years are the<br/>\nmost<br/>\n  challenging and that might be part of it. I think there is a title for a<br/>\n  book I have been meaning to buy called &quot;Your 4 year old friend or foe?&quot;<br/>\n  which sounds about right. And recently I have been noticing and Dr.<br/>\nJekyll/<br/>\n  Mr. Hyde type shift in her on occasion. I also know that this is the age<br/>\n  where she is feeling her own autonomy and wanting more freedom and is in a<br/>\n  &quot;come love and hug me, go away I am a big girl&quot; stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I didn&#39;t hand over complete autonomy, if anything she wants more than I am<br/>\n  comfortable with giving at this stage AND more than I think she can safely<br/>\n  handle. She seems to have no ability to see danger realistically at times.<br/>\nI<br/>\n  can&#39;t think of an example, but she seems to think her will to do something<br/>\n  safely is enough you know? Oh well cavities are one, I explain why<br/>\nbrushing<br/>\n  our teeth is important and that without proper care we could get cavities,<br/>\n  she refuses to brush and then promises me she won&#39;t get a cavity, like she<br/>\n  can control it with her will.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It turns out at the end of the day, she was hungry. But no effort to help<br/>\n  her to get food into her was welcome, it was rejected with screaming. So<br/>\nno<br/>\n  matter how much I talk to her about the value of protein on moods, the<br/>\nvalue<br/>\n  of food on moods, she isn&#39;t getting it and if too busy playing or having<br/>\nfun<br/>\n  will reject food until her mood is unbearable to all around her and she is<br/>\n  miserable as well, but then she continues to reject (even more strongly)<br/>\nany<br/>\n  suggestion of what might fix it. Finally she ate a HUGE turkey dinner<br/>\n  (thanksgiving here) and became Mr. Hyde again:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyone have any thoughts on that one? I will try to talk to her about it<br/>\n  tomorrow and see if I can help her make the connection but am not overly<br/>\n  optimistic.

I too struggle<br/>\n  with how much freedom is too much and am I saying yes too much. Finding<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  proper balance is really tough. I think that you have to do what is in<br/>\nyour<br/>\n  heart and right for you and your family. Someone told me to follow my<br/>\nheart<br/>\n  and sometimes that sounds cliché, but it&#39;s really good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Btw, how old is your daughter? I wonder if this could be a phase of some<br/>\n  sort. Personally I don&#39;t think handing over total autonomy to a child is<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  correct thing to do in some cases. Children need firm and loving guidance<br/>\n  and I don&#39;t think unschooling means telling our kids yes all the time.<br/>\n  Personal boundaries are important and the skills to respect other people&#39;s<br/>\n  personal boundaries are important. She needs to understand what abusive<br/>\n  behavior is and learn that there are consequences to such behavior.

And not for the better. She has become<br/>\n    petulant, demanding, overbearing, rude, mouthy, obnoxious, inpatient and<br/>\n    miserable to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    If it isn&#39;t something she finds to be fun or exciting then she is rude<br/>\nand<br/>\n    loud and domineering and just plain ruins everything for everyone else<br/>\n  with<br/>\n    her endless whining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t even enjoy her company anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    If my husband or I are not playing with her she is bored and all she<br/>\nwants<br/>\n    to do is watch TV. She no longer does ANYTHING on her own, she needs one<br/>\n  of<br/>\n    us or someone else to be there playing with her. If we want to do<br/>\nanything<br/>\n    for ourselves, it is boring and rude and she screams at us about how she<br/>\n    wants what she wants right now and if we don&#39;t give it to her she will<br/>\n  (put<br/>\n    in your threat here).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am sick of it and after a miserable day out with my mom and sister who<br/>\n  are<br/>\n    visiting, I am sorry I ever discovered unschooling. Before I started<br/>\n  reading<br/>\n    about it and letting go of our rules and restrictions, I had a child who<br/>\n  was<br/>\n    socially acceptable and pleasant to be around most of the time. Yes that<br/>\n    might have been because she behaved because she was afraid of<br/>\npunishment,<br/>\n    but it was better than being out in public and her telling me that she<br/>\n  won&#39;t<br/>\n    do anything I say and blowing a raspberry in my face. Makes me want to<br/>\n  smack<br/>\n    her to be honest.  And we live in a society where a certain amount of<br/>\n    appropriate behaviour is expected and right now, I wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\n  comfortable<br/>\n    taking her out to many social situations at all, where as 6 months ago I<br/>\n    felt confident taking her anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I can hear her right now, demanding my sister play Barbie&#39;s with her<br/>\n  AGAIN.<br/>\n    That is almost all she has done since she got her yesterday. My sister<br/>\n  said<br/>\n    no and she got screamed at. She suggested a book and she got screamed at<br/>\n    because it isn&#39;t the right book for Hannah right this instant, or simply<br/>\n    because it was someone else&#39;s idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    The way I feel right now I will be leaving the unschooling as a<br/>\nlifestyle<br/>\n    path (although I will stick with it for educational purposes) but will<br/>\n    reinstate our rules and regulations for living, because without them I<br/>\n  have<br/>\n    a child I don&#39;t like who has no respect or compassion or pleasant<br/>\nthought<br/>\n    for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know what some of you will say to this: &quot;stick it out&quot; &quot;stay the<br/>\ncourse&quot;<br/>\n    &quot;it will get better&quot; &quot;it is just her reacting to the new freedoms and<br/>\nshe<br/>\n    will come back to balance eventually&quot;. I just don&#39;t think I have it in<br/>\nme<br/>\n  to<br/>\n    do that. I was near tears in the mall today because she was so obnoxious<br/>\n    because every single minute was not spent entertaining her. And if I<br/>\ntried<br/>\n    to talk to her about sharing and thinking of other people, she blew a<br/>\n    raspberry at me or stuck her fingers in her ears or some other rude<br/>\naction<br/>\n    that just was over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t think I expect anyone here to have any answers for me, I just<br/>\n    thought at least here it was in context, where some of my other lists<br/>\n  would<br/>\n    suggest time outs and spanking which I am not prepared to go to right<br/>\nyet,<br/>\n    although I know my family (including dh) thinks I am a lunatic for<br/>\ntaking<br/>\n    such abuse from her as I do. And yes before you jump on me, it is<br/>\nabusive<br/>\n    sometimes, her demands are so over the top and impossible to achieve<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  it<br/>\n    is too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I will ask her if she is hungry, no she will say I will suggest things.<br/>\nno<br/>\n    thank you she will say, then as soon as I sit down, she wants me to get<br/>\n  her<br/>\n    something to eat. She doesn&#39;t know what it is though, I have to help her<br/>\n    decide, but everything I suggest is not only rejected but rejected in<br/>\n    screaming, with anger at me for being so stupid I can&#39;t read her mind.<br/>\n  When<br/>\n    I say I have no more suggestions, she screams and berates me and tells<br/>\nme<br/>\n  I<br/>\n    HAVE to get her something to eat or she won&#39;t love me or something else.<br/>\n  So<br/>\n    I stay calm and ask her what she wants and make suggestions again and so<br/>\n  it<br/>\n    continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I hate this.

Your little girl must be feeling pretty terrible to be so angry so much. (I would surmise that there&#39;s no such thing as a happy dictator). My oldest daughter went through a similiar period when I let go of lots of control at 4.5 and I remember dreading her waking up each morning. Children know when you do not love them unconditionationally. Or at least it feels to them like they are not loveable when they act so badly. It can also bring up for a parent all the feelings of powerlessness as that they had as a child--when they witness a very powerful child.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Some things that I gleaned from recently listening to Naomi Aldort&#39;s tapes &quot;Trusting our Children, Trusting Ourselves&quot;: that its unrealistic to expect children to NOT be selfish. They are egocentric and though they have may be very altruistic at times, they should be self-centered. That doesn&#39;t mean you should be a doormat; but to state your needs and desires with calm and optimism (no small order, I know!) Also that &quot;goody-goody&quot; children are the most worrisome: they have given over their power in return for praise and affection. She also tells this beautiful story about her own son (then 3 I think), who messed up all their clothes in the bedroom for two months (and all Naomi said was &quot;Oh No!&quot; and would clean them up) so that he could feel his power. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When there is conflict and a level of anxiety about this conflict, I think we instinctively want to return to what we know--and of course for most of us it means some type of coercion and defensiveness. I think that if you focus on her feelings and yours (and don&#39;t get to wordy about it with her) and not become scared that she is going to be a horrible brat her entire life (I know that I can easily fall down this slippery slope of catastrophizing), you&#39;ll beable to connect with her. My guess is that there is a of lack of trust between you: she doesn&#39;t trust that you really want to help her that you just want her to be good (again I&#39;m just guessing). Perhaps you need to reconnect with what you love about your daughter, not to make her behave better, but in such a way that you can communicate that you really love her and trust her.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think you&#39;re really brave to write to this list and I wish I had had this kind of support when my daughter was having a similiar hard time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Leslie in Mass<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195508922,"authorName":"wieldingwords@bellsouth.net","from":"&lt;wieldingwords@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097504924","msgId":3503,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDExMTQyODQ0LkhRSkcxNzg3LmltZjIzYWVjLm1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldEBtYWlsLmJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3502,"nextInTopic":3504,"prevInTime":3502,"nextInTime":3504,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We talk during calm times about how people don&#39;t like to do things for people who are being mean to them, that people can&#39;t always even understand what he wants if he is being mean, etc..  I use people because Dan also gets abusive with his siblings.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought long and hard about how to handle this.  I didn&#39;t want to punish him....I didn&#39;t want to model tolerating abuse...I couldn&#39;t allow him to be abusive to his siblings.  So I thought about what I would do with an abusive adult....I would tell them cut it out and if they didn&#39;t I would leave the room, ask them to leave, whatever....but I wouldn&#39;t just stand there and take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with Dan I did lots of things.  I would ask him to speak nicely to me, I would give him a hug, I would leave the room, I would rub his back, I would do whatever seemed appropriate at the time....If I was offering suggestions and he refused them all and continued to berate me, I would say &quot;let me know when you decide&quot; and I would leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lots of work, Dan started to calm down when I tell him &quot;I will gladly help you but don&#39;t be mean to me.&quot; Now, I just turn around and give him a look, not mean but like &quot;I can&#39;t believe you just said that to me&quot; and he stops it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\njulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Leslie530@...\">Leslie530@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, October 11, 2004 8:27 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 10/11/2004 7:47:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you  have had issues in the past with people not recognizing your<br/>\n  boundaries,  then maybe you need to work on making them more obvious.

She sounds like a child that is into her head and not her body (not aware of hunger until out of control, etc.).  Here are my recommendations:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)  Bring her food and drink throughout the day.  Say something sweet like &quot;I thought you might like these&quot; or &quot;I was thinking of you when I made these&quot;.  If she eats it great, if not great.  Don&#39;t ask her if she wants it, just set it down next to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  Spend time giving her massage or just rubbing her back or gently scratching her scalp, letting her hair run through your fingers.  It will help her be more aware of her body if done regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\n3)  Remember that cavities aren&#39;t dangerous....they are a pain in the butt but not dangerous &lt;grin&gt;.  It can be hard for young children to see the connection between oral hygiene and cavities but they can probably make a better connection between brushing and fresh breath.  Find out why she doesn&#39;t want to brush (she might not like the paste, she might just be seeing how far she can take this &quot;yes&quot; thing).<br/>\n<br/>\n4)  Unschooling is hardest on the parent.  You have to be very, very clear on your own personal boundaries.  Years ago, when we first started, I kept hearing about &quot;Kids will learn to regulate themselves&quot; so I thought that meant to give the kids elbow room, mention that I didn&#39;t want them jumping on my bed and they would regulate themselves.  Didn&#39;t happen at my house.  The kids went nuts and I was very, very resentful.  We now have only one rule at our house &quot;You cannot cause harm, period.&quot;  There are times when I make the kids stop what they are doing whether they want to or not because what they are doing is causing harm to someone.  I would also make an adult stop something if they were causing harm.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  We had just moved to Houston from the boondocks and Zach (5) was shooting his bb gun into a tree between 2 houses across the street.  He was sure he wouldn&#39;t hit the house.  (With his aim, I was sure he wouldn&#39;t either....he&#39;s really good.)  But people already looked at us weird for the kids being out playing all the time, we didn&#39;t need the police being called because people saw a 5yo aiming a bb gun in the direction of their house.  I gave him lots of alternatives but told him that what he was doing was absolutely not an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nZach hates to brush his teeth so he usually didn&#39;t.  Grossed me out but I kept out of it other than to talk to him at times about how it can be important.  Then he got a bad cavity.  Went to the dentist who pulled several of Zach&#39;s teeth.  The dentist told me that Zach has genetically bad enamel and if he wanted to still have teeth at 20 he needed to change his diet and his oral hygiene.  So it was no longer &quot;there MIGHT be a problem&quot;, it was right there.  Zach&#39;s choices were infringing on the rest of us (costing us lots of money, perhaps getting us in trouble with legal if the dentist wanted to cause problems), so his right to choose stopped where it infringed on the rights of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot everyone will agree with that, but that is how it works in our house.<br/>\n<br/>\njulie S.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sherri-Lee Pressman <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, October 11, 2004 4:47 AM<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hi Virginia,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thank you. You are right, follow your heart, I just have a hard time hearing<br/>\n  my own heart sometimes and knowing what is best/right. Or when I do think I<br/>\n  do, then I doubt and second guess myself too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My daughter is 4.5. So of course I remember that the half years are the most<br/>\n  challenging and that might be part of it. I think there is a title for a<br/>\n  book I have been meaning to buy called &quot;Your 4 year old friend or foe?&quot;<br/>\n  which sounds about right. And recently I have been noticing and Dr. Jekyll/<br/>\n  Mr. Hyde type shift in her on occasion. I also know that this is the age<br/>\n  where she is feeling her own autonomy and wanting more freedom and is in a<br/>\n  &quot;come love and hug me, go away I am a big girl&quot; stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I didn&#39;t hand over complete autonomy, if anything she wants more than I am<br/>\n  comfortable with giving at this stage AND more than I think she can safely<br/>\n  handle. She seems to have no ability to see danger realistically at times. I<br/>\n  can&#39;t think of an example, but she seems to think her will to do something<br/>\n  safely is enough you know? Oh well cavities are one, I explain why brushing<br/>\n  our teeth is important and that without proper care we could get cavities,<br/>\n  she refuses to brush and then promises me she won&#39;t get a cavity, like she<br/>\n  can control it with her will.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It turns out at the end of the day, she was hungry. But no effort to help<br/>\n  her to get food into her was welcome, it was rejected with screaming. So no<br/>\n  matter how much I talk to her about the value of protein on moods, the value<br/>\n  of food on moods, she isn&#39;t getting it and if too busy playing or having fun<br/>\n  will reject food until her mood is unbearable to all around her and she is<br/>\n  miserable as well, but then she continues to reject (even more strongly) any<br/>\n  suggestion of what might fix it. Finally she ate a HUGE turkey dinner<br/>\n  (thanksgiving here) and became Mr. Hyde again:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyone have any thoughts on that one? I will try to talk to her about it<br/>\n  tomorrow and see if I can help her make the connection but am not overly<br/>\n  optimistic. How do I talk to her about these things without getting a<br/>\n  preachy sound or just using too many words, hard to learn to shorten things<br/>\n  up at this age:)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for your thoughts and support,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n  Need safe and natural health products?<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Virginia Glasser [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:virginia@...\">virginia@...</a>] <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, October 10, 2004 2:40 PM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow. You poor thing. I can totally empathize with you and wish I could help.<br/>\n  Being a parent is the hardest thing in the world isn&#39;t it? I too struggle<br/>\n  with how much freedom is too much and am I saying yes too much. Finding the<br/>\n  proper balance is really tough. I think that you have to do what is in your<br/>\n  heart and right for you and your family. Someone told me to follow my heart<br/>\n  and sometimes that sounds cliché, but it&#39;s really good advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Btw, how old is your daughter? I wonder if this could be a phase of some<br/>\n  sort. Personally I don&#39;t think handing over total autonomy to a child is the<br/>\n  correct thing to do in some cases. Children need firm and loving guidance<br/>\n  and I don&#39;t think unschooling means telling our kids yes all the time.<br/>\n  Personal boundaries are important and the skills to respect other people&#39;s<br/>\n  personal boundaries are important. She needs to understand what abusive<br/>\n  behavior is and learn that there are consequences to such behavior. This<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t mean you have to give up the unschooling way of life in my opinion.<br/>\n  Be sure to lay out in simple terms what actions will bring about what<br/>\n  consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just my humble opinion.

If we want to do anything<br/>\n    for ourselves, it is boring and rude and she screams at us about how she<br/>\n    wants what she wants right now and if we don&#39;t give it to her she will<br/>\n  (put<br/>\n    in your threat here).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am sick of it and after a miserable day out with my mom and sister who<br/>\n  are<br/>\n    visiting, I am sorry I ever discovered unschooling. Before I started<br/>\n  reading<br/>\n    about it and letting go of our rules and restrictions, I had a child who<br/>\n  was<br/>\n    socially acceptable and pleasant to be around most of the time. Yes that<br/>\n    might have been because she behaved because she was afraid of punishment,<br/>\n    but it was better than being out in public and her telling me that she<br/>\n  won&#39;t<br/>\n    do anything I say and blowing a raspberry in my face. Makes me want to<br/>\n  smack<br/>\n    her to be honest.  And we live in a society where a certain amount of<br/>\n    appropriate behaviour is expected and right now, I wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\n  comfortable<br/>\n    taking her out to many social situations at all, where as 6 months ago I<br/>\n    felt confident taking her anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I can hear her right now, demanding my sister play Barbie&#39;s with her<br/>\n  AGAIN.<br/>\n    That is almost all she has done since she got her yesterday. My sister<br/>\n  said<br/>\n    no and she got screamed at. She suggested a book and she got screamed at<br/>\n    because it isn&#39;t the right book for Hannah right this instant, or simply<br/>\n    because it was someone else&#39;s idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    The way I feel right now I will be leaving the unschooling as a lifestyle<br/>\n    path (although I will stick with it for educational purposes) but will<br/>\n    reinstate our rules and regulations for living, because without them I<br/>\n  have<br/>\n    a child I don&#39;t like who has no respect or compassion or pleasant thought<br/>\n    for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I know what some of you will say to this: &quot;stick it out&quot; &quot;stay the course&quot;<br/>\n    &quot;it will get better&quot; &quot;it is just her reacting to the new freedoms and she<br/>\n    will come back to balance eventually&quot;. I just don&#39;t think I have it in me<br/>\n  to<br/>\n    do that. I was near tears in the mall today because she was so obnoxious<br/>\n    because every single minute was not spent entertaining her. And if I tried<br/>\n    to talk to her about sharing and thinking of other people, she blew a<br/>\n    raspberry at me or stuck her fingers in her ears or some other rude action<br/>\n    that just was over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I don&#39;t think I expect anyone here to have any answers for me, I just<br/>\n    thought at least here it was in context, where some of my other lists<br/>\n  would<br/>\n    suggest time outs and spanking which I am not prepared to go to right yet,<br/>\n    although I know my family (including dh) thinks I am a lunatic for taking<br/>\n    such abuse from her as I do. And yes before you jump on me, it is abusive<br/>\n    sometimes, her demands are so over the top and impossible to achieve that<br/>\n  it<br/>\n    is too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I will ask her if she is hungry, no she will say I will suggest things. no<br/>\n    thank you she will say, then as soon as I sit down, she wants me to get<br/>\n  her<br/>\n    something to eat. She doesn&#39;t know what it is though, I have to help her<br/>\n    decide, but everything I suggest is not only rejected but rejected in<br/>\n    screaming, with anger at me for being so stupid I can&#39;t read her mind.<br/>\n  When<br/>\n    I say I have no more suggestions, she screams and berates me and tells me<br/>\n  I<br/>\n    HAVE to get her something to eat or she won&#39;t love me or something else.<br/>\n  So<br/>\n    I stay calm and ask her what she wants and make suggestions again and so<br/>\n  it<br/>\n    continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    I hate this. Where has my pleasant child gone?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\n    Who is sending this with trepidation about putting these raw thoughts on<br/>\n    this list, but really can&#39;t talk to anyone else about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n          Yahoo!

I keep bringing up NVC, but this part of your message really <br/>\nreminds me of something.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Things in our world have changed. And not for the better. She has become<br/>\n&gt; petulant, demanding, overbearing, rude, mouthy, obnoxious, inpatient and<br/>\n&gt; miserable to be around.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In the NVC he writes about the following three stages:<br/>\n<br/>\n1st stage - Emotional slavery: we see ourselves responsible for other&#39;s <br/>\nfeelings.<br/>\n2nd stage- &quot;Obnoxious&quot;: we feel angry; we no longer want to be responsible <br/>\nfor others&#39; feelings<br/>\n3rd stage - Emotional liberation: we take responsibility for our intentions <br/>\nand actions<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like your little one is in stage 2.  I know I live most of my life in <br/>\nstage 1 (because I was taught to be a &#39;good girl&#39;), and am doing my best to <br/>\nmove beyond it.  Now that I have this NVC model to work with, I can see how <br/>\nat earlier points in my life I have vacilated between stage 1 and 2, and <br/>\njust recently was talking to a longtime friend and my sister about how much <br/>\n&quot;nicer&quot; I am now, but it is a REAL nice, one that reflects my spending more <br/>\ntime in stage 3 than ever before.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal point of view is that we&#39;re all sort of stymied when our kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t do the &#39;good kid&#39; thing because we&#39;re still feeling enslaved to what <br/>\nothers (even strangers!) think is appropriate behavior. My older ds has <br/>\nalways been more challenging, and I think it can be a really hard transition <br/>\nfor someone who has always had an easy kid to have to deal with the changes. <br/>\nAs someone else said in their response, a new sibling is a really big deal, <br/>\nand that may be behind some of these problems too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If we want to do anything<br/>\n&gt; for ourselves, it is boring and rude and she screams at us about how she<br/>\n&gt; wants what she wants right now and if we don&#39;t give it to her she will <br/>\n&gt; (put<br/>\n&gt; in your threat here).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Like it or not, any parenting philosophy that uses parental power/authority <br/>\nis a threat-based system.  One thing we did here was say &quot;we&#39;re not going to <br/>\ndo forcing (a word my then 4yo ds could understand) anymore.  Threats are a <br/>\nkind of forcing and we&#39;re not going to do them.&quot;  So we stopped.  Does our <br/>\nds still make threats?  Sure.  He&#39;d had a lot of experience with them, and <br/>\nfrankly I am still catching myself making them.  I occasionally remind him <br/>\nthat &quot;x sounds like a threat, which is a forcing&quot;, but now when he makes a <br/>\nthreat I mostly just hear it as his attempt to gain some power in the <br/>\nsituation.  If he were feeling OK he&#39;d not need to do that, so how can I try <br/>\nto identify the underlying need.  I do not think I need to follow his <br/>\ndemand, but I do need to see if I can address the underlying need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If my husband or I are not playing with her she is bored and all she wants<br/>\n&gt; to do is watch TV. She no longer does ANYTHING on her own, she needs one <br/>\n&gt; of<br/>\n&gt; us or someone else to be there playing with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I am not sure what to say about this, except that we have this here too.  I <br/>\nthink part of the problem is age related - they&#39;re interested in things that <br/>\nare above their skill level, and they seek the stimulation of having an <br/>\nadult to introduce them to and help them with the more advanced <br/>\nconcepts/skills that they crave.  It is hard, and it has made me see how <br/>\nmuch interaction he really needs (where is that village anyway!).  One thing <br/>\nwe do is to have a few hours a week where he has a mother&#39;s helper who will <br/>\nplay with him and help satisfy that need.  You know, most people send their <br/>\nkids to school with a sigh of relief - kids really do require a lot of time, <br/>\nenergy, and interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The way I feel right now I will be leaving the unschooling as a lifestyle<br/>\n&gt; path (although I will stick with it for educational purposes) but will<br/>\n&gt; reinstate our rules and regulations for living, because without them I <br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; a child I don&#39;t like who has no respect or compassion or pleasant thought<br/>\n&gt; for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hope you don&#39;t, for you and for your dd.  It is HARD to make this <br/>\ntransition, but the more we respect our children&#39;s needs, the more we can <br/>\ncreate a base of understanding.  I was at a party the other night that was <br/>\nfull of young families, and a 9yo girl was eating some chips and her father <br/>\nyells at her across the room &quot;No more chips for you.&quot;  I felt embarrassed <br/>\nfor her, and really shocked.  It helped me to realize how far we&#39;ve come in <br/>\nour family, as my dh and I both felt uncomfortable with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the food thing goes, I think that sometimes learning is messy.  If <br/>\nshe wanted to finger paint, you&#39;d expect mess and prepare for it by <br/>\nproviding a good place to do it.  She&#39;s learning about what her body needs <br/>\n(which may not actually be protein, I&#39;ve found, even though I love protein <br/>\nmyself) and that process may be a bit messy (which looks like meltdowns, <br/>\netc.)  I&#39;d much rather have a child who spends ages 4 and 5 figuring out <br/>\nfood through trial and error with support and information than have one who <br/>\nat 45 is still trying to figure it out with little success, like most people <br/>\nI know whose food choices were limited, monitored and controlled.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling you really do see value in the lifestyle we&#39;re discussing <br/>\nhere, because you&#39;ve stayed around this list for a long time.  Hope some of <br/>\nwhat I wrote is helpful to you, as I can see this moment in time is really a <br/>\nstruggle for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\nPS - I think when we first start saying &quot;yes&quot; we come up against all of our <br/>\nfears/doubts/etc.  and it can feel really overwhelming.  It is a *process* <br/>\nof getting to a place where the whole family is getting our needs met.  I <br/>\nknow I am constantly working on making sure I am getting my needs met so I <br/>\ncan be calm and available.  I liked the suggestion that someone made about <br/>\nsaying &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll do that when I finish my meal.&quot;  That way you still get to <br/>\nsay yes to her and to yourself.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097495175","msgId":3496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDExMTE0NjE1LlhQUkQxNTExOC5tdGExMy5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PDBJNUUwMEwwUVlTMkNaQGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":3495,"nextInTopic":3497,"prevInTime":3495,"nextInTime":3497,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"WOW...

I do have personal boundaries, I have always been lousy at<br/>\nestablishing them with people and because of that have anger issues when<br/>\npeople don&#39;t recognize them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have had issues in the past with people not recognizing your<br/>\nboundaries, then maybe you need to work on making them more obvious. If<br/>\nadults have a hard time reading them, then your 4 year old definitely will.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize your dd was only 4.5 years old.  4 was a really emotional<br/>\nyear with my oldest dd.  She would melt down very easily.  It was just plain<br/>\nhard.  But it got easier eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what has changed if you didn&#39;t have many rules before?  Is it that before<br/>\nif she acted like that after you said no and sat down that you would have<br/>\ngiven her a time out and now you don&#39;t?  Tantrums can be difficult to watch,<br/>\nbut there is an alternative to just no too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you can nip these things in the bud and avoid the tantrum it<br/>\nwould be best.  As you get better at seeing potential problems ahead of time<br/>\nit&#39;ll be easier.  I exercise in the basement every morning.  Sometimes I ask<br/>\nmy kids if they want me to get them something before I go down.  Other times<br/>\nI just know they&#39;ll be hungry and I just bring a couple things to the living<br/>\nroom for them to eat and drink if they get hungry.  I make sure they are all<br/>\nsettled in so I have less of a chance of getting interrupted.  They have<br/>\nchanged their minds in the past and so I try to be aware that they might not<br/>\nknow they are going to get hungry soon and plan for that myself.  I even<br/>\npour drinks and put them in the fridge or on the arm of the couch next to<br/>\nthem. (just in case)  Try to remember when she last ate and plan<br/>\naccordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option would be to tell her &quot;yes&quot; you&#39;ll get something for her, in a<br/>\nfew minutes.  (Maybe next commercial)  You might even suggest she get a<br/>\nstring cheese (or whatever) out of the fridge to hold her over till you get<br/>\nher something.  My kids at that age didn&#39;t like to do for themselves in the<br/>\nfood department.   They just plain liked to be waited on and I didn&#39;t mind,<br/>\nas long as they were a little patient with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIs she getting all the rest she needs?  No bedtime to me isn&#39;t about just<br/>\nwaiting till they fall down in their tracks exhausted.  It&#39;s about watching<br/>\ntheir body signals and going to bed when they are tired instead of at some<br/>\nset time.  I still lie down with my girls while they go to sleep so sleep<br/>\nisn&#39;t something that is seen as terrible.  They don&#39;t feel like they are<br/>\nmissing anything and they feel secure and safe.  Provide snacks often if she<br/>\ngets hungry often.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking things through works, but not quite as quickly as punishment.  It is<br/>\namazing now to watch my two dd&#39;s work out something on their own now at ages<br/>\n8 and 9 after watching me model it and help them work out things for so many<br/>\nyears.  Sometimes they come up with a better solution than I ever could have<br/>\ndreamed of.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d get that four year old book you mentioned.  Sometimes it&#39;s a help just<br/>\nto know that it&#39;s a stage and they&#39;ll most likely outgrow the issues that<br/>\nare bothering you.  You can go to Amazon and put in the title and read<br/>\nseveral pages on-line.  Look around the site and you&#39;ll see a link to click<br/>\nabout half way down the page.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGot to run.

I also know that this is the age<br/>\nwhere she is feeling her own autonomy and wanting more freedom and is in a<br/>\n&quot;come love and hug me, go away I am a big girl&quot; stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t hand over complete autonomy, if anything she wants more than I am<br/>\ncomfortable with giving at this stage AND more than I think she can safely<br/>\nhandle. She seems to have no ability to see danger realistically at times. I<br/>\ncan&#39;t think of an example, but she seems to think her will to do something<br/>\nsafely is enough you know? Oh well cavities are one, I explain why brushing<br/>\nour teeth is important and that without proper care we could get cavities,<br/>\nshe refuses to brush and then promises me she won&#39;t get a cavity, like she<br/>\ncan control it with her will.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out at the end of the day, she was hungry. But no effort to help<br/>\nher to get food into her was welcome, it was rejected with screaming. So no<br/>\nmatter how much I talk to her about the value of protein on moods, the value<br/>\nof food on moods, she isn&#39;t getting it and if too busy playing or having fun<br/>\nwill reject food until her mood is unbearable to all around her and she is<br/>\nmiserable as well, but then she continues to reject (even more strongly) any<br/>\nsuggestion of what might fix it. Finally she ate a HUGE turkey dinner<br/>\n(thanksgiving here) and became Mr. Hyde again:)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have any thoughts on that one? I will try to talk to her about it<br/>\ntomorrow and see if I can help her make the connection but am not overly<br/>\noptimistic. How do I talk to her about these things without getting a<br/>\npreachy sound or just using too many words, hard to learn to shorten things<br/>\nup at this age:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts and support,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Virginia Glasser [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:virginia@...\">virginia@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Sunday, October 10, 2004 2:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.

And not for the better. She has become<br/>\n  petulant, demanding, overbearing, rude, mouthy, obnoxious, inpatient and<br/>\n  miserable to be around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If it isn&#39;t something she finds to be fun or exciting then she is rude and<br/>\n  loud and domineering and just plain ruins everything for everyone else<br/>\nwith<br/>\n  her endless whining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t even enjoy her company anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  If my husband or I are not playing with her she is bored and all she wants<br/>\n  to do is watch TV. She no longer does ANYTHING on her own, she needs one<br/>\nof<br/>\n  us or someone else to be there playing with her. If we want to do anything<br/>\n  for ourselves, it is boring and rude and she screams at us about how she<br/>\n  wants what she wants right now and if we don&#39;t give it to her she will<br/>\n(put<br/>\n  in your threat here).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am sick of it and after a miserable day out with my mom and sister who<br/>\nare<br/>\n  visiting, I am sorry I ever discovered unschooling. Before I started<br/>\nreading<br/>\n  about it and letting go of our rules and restrictions, I had a child who<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  socially acceptable and pleasant to be around most of the time. Yes that<br/>\n  might have been because she behaved because she was afraid of punishment,<br/>\n  but it was better than being out in public and her telling me that she<br/>\nwon&#39;t<br/>\n  do anything I say and blowing a raspberry in my face. Makes me want to<br/>\nsmack<br/>\n  her to be honest.  And we live in a society where a certain amount of<br/>\n  appropriate behaviour is expected and right now, I wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>\ncomfortable<br/>\n  taking her out to many social situations at all, where as 6 months ago I<br/>\n  felt confident taking her anywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can hear her right now, demanding my sister play Barbie&#39;s with her<br/>\nAGAIN.<br/>\n  That is almost all she has done since she got her yesterday. My sister<br/>\nsaid<br/>\n  no and she got screamed at. She suggested a book and she got screamed at<br/>\n  because it isn&#39;t the right book for Hannah right this instant, or simply<br/>\n  because it was someone else&#39;s idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  The way I feel right now I will be leaving the unschooling as a lifestyle<br/>\n  path (although I will stick with it for educational purposes) but will<br/>\n  reinstate our rules and regulations for living, because without them I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n  a child I don&#39;t like who has no respect or compassion or pleasant thought<br/>\n  for anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know what some of you will say to this: &quot;stick it out&quot; &quot;stay the course&quot;<br/>\n  &quot;it will get better&quot; &quot;it is just her reacting to the new freedoms and she<br/>\n  will come back to balance eventually&quot;. I just don&#39;t think I have it in me<br/>\nto<br/>\n  do that. I was near tears in the mall today because she was so obnoxious<br/>\n  because every single minute was not spent entertaining her. And if I tried<br/>\n  to talk to her about sharing and thinking of other people, she blew a<br/>\n  raspberry at me or stuck her fingers in her ears or some other rude action<br/>\n  that just was over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t think I expect anyone here to have any answers for me, I just<br/>\n  thought at least here it was in context, where some of my other lists<br/>\nwould<br/>\n  suggest time outs and spanking which I am not prepared to go to right yet,<br/>\n  although I know my family (including dh) thinks I am a lunatic for taking<br/>\n  such abuse from her as I do. And yes before you jump on me, it is abusive<br/>\n  sometimes, her demands are so over the top and impossible to achieve that<br/>\nit<br/>\n  is too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I will ask her if she is hungry, no she will say I will suggest things. no<br/>\n  thank you she will say, then as soon as I sit down, she wants me to get<br/>\nher<br/>\n  something to eat. She doesn&#39;t know what it is though, I have to help her<br/>\n  decide, but everything I suggest is not only rejected but rejected in<br/>\n  screaming, with anger at me for being so stupid I can&#39;t read her mind.<br/>\nWhen<br/>\n  I say I have no more suggestions, she screams and berates me and tells me<br/>\nI<br/>\n  HAVE to get her something to eat or she won&#39;t love me or something else.<br/>\nSo<br/>\n  I stay calm and ask her what she wants and make suggestions again and so<br/>\nit<br/>\n  continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hate this.

I was getting better at that, until this whole<br/>\nunschooling thing came up and I started thinking about doing things<br/>\ncheerfully for my child and modeling that. So I started saying yes more, I<br/>\nwould get up and get her a drink of water when she asked, so she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to miss her show and I was seeing that she was most willing to go and<br/>\nso something for me in return. That seemed to be working. But perhaps I went<br/>\na little overboard on it and it has started to have bad feelings and<br/>\nresentment in the actions for me, which of course come out in my body<br/>\nlanguage and facial expression and doesn&#39;t help to achieve my goal. Thank<br/>\nyou for mentioning this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was saying, &quot;ok I am going to sit down and rest now, so do you want me to<br/>\nget you something to eat before I do, because once I am sitting down I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally want to get up again soon.&quot; She would say &quot;no thanks mommy I am not<br/>\nhungry&quot; I would sit down, 5 minutes later she would say &quot;mommy will get me<br/>\nXXX?&quot; I would say &quot;I just sat down and don&#39;t want to get up, why don&#39;t you<br/>\nget it?&quot; She has lots of food available to her, that she picks out at the<br/>\nstore that are in places she can reach that she actually doesn&#39;t need me to<br/>\ndo for her. Sometimes she was just looking at me and instantly starting<br/>\nwhining and demanding that I go do it for her. I really just don&#39;t know how<br/>\nto deal with that sometimes. I remind her that I let her know I was going to<br/>\nsit and asked her before hand and her answer was no thanks and her response<br/>\nis &quot;I changed my mind.&quot; Well ok that isn&#39;t a bad thing is it? And sometimes<br/>\nthen saying no felt like punishing her for changing her mind, which isn&#39;t<br/>\ngood. SO I would get up and get it and then sit again with the same<br/>\ninformation for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you handle that situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never had &quot;lots&quot; of rules. Mainly, bedtime, which we still have although<br/>\na little later now, and we turned off the TV at my insistence more than we<br/>\ndo now.

As much as I<br/>\nam happy to wait on my children and say yes as often as possible, I will not<br/>\nreact kindly if I am treated poorly. Maybe it&#39;s my rebellious personality,<br/>\nbut when I am treated badly, I don&#39;t have any desire to help out the person<br/>\ndoing it and I&#39;d be clear about that.    If I asked my children (which I do<br/>\noften) if they&#39;d like me to bring them something to eat before I sit down or<br/>\ngo exercise and they say no and change their mind after, I would suggest<br/>\nthey find themselves something or wait until the next time that I am up. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure why your dd is acting like she is acting but it sounds like<br/>\nsomething more serious is under all that anger.  If my child were acting<br/>\nlike that, I wouldn&#39;t want to be around her either and I would make that<br/>\nclear.  If one of my children treated their siblings like that, I would<br/>\nintervene and tell them they can&#39;t treat them like that.  They don&#39;t deserve<br/>\nto be treated so poorly and I would separate them and try to figure out what<br/>\ncaused the trouble to begin with.  You are no different.  You don&#39;t deserve<br/>\nto be treated so badly and I would be the first one to tell her that.  But,<br/>\nyou also need to get to the bottom of why she is feeling the need to be so<br/>\ncontrolling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I am just reading into what you wrote, but it sounds like you had lots<br/>\nof rules and then dropped them completely without making her aware of your<br/>\npersonal boundaries.

If<br/>\n  you are now nine months pregnant or a new mom you&#39;re probably exhausted<br/>\n  and under a lot of stress.  I know it&#39;s hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Unschooling means not doing school.  Your daughter is young, not even<br/>\n  school age.  Would it help to think of how you would be living with her<br/>\n  if you&#39;d never heard of unschooling?  What things would you be doing<br/>\n  differently and would they ensure the peaceful family situation you<br/>\n  desire?<br/>\n  Applying the unschooling philosophy to parenting is an extension of<br/>\n  unschooling that some parents are not comfortable with.  You don&#39;t need<br/>\n  anyone&#39;s approval to parent the way you want to.   You get to make all<br/>\n  the choices about how you live with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Because she&#39;s very young, and you are under a lot of stress, (and have<br/>\n  you said you&#39;re husband is older and not always supportive when you&#39;d<br/>\n  like reassurance?)  it&#39;s possible that the difficulties you&#39;re having are<br/>\n  not as related to unschooling as they seem to be right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a post in August (?) you expressed some of the same frustrations, that<br/>\n  she&#39;s quite demanding and you don&#39;t always know how to handle that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She&#39;s so little, she has a mama who&#39;s worn out from pregnancy and not<br/>\n  able to do as many things as she wants.  She might be feeling lonely.<br/>\n  She&#39;s probably frustrated and angry.  It so hard to have a lot of anger<br/>\n  when you&#39;re little, it&#39;s such a big emotion and it makes you feel so<br/>\n  yucky and it&#39;s so hard to not just let it out all over the closest person<br/>\n  you can find.  Even adults do this after a lot of years on the planet and<br/>\n  a lot of experience with communication.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You&#39;ve used some tough words &quot;rude, mouthy, obnoxious...&quot;  and while I<br/>\n  don&#39;t doubt that is what it feels like to you, I don&#39;t think that is her<br/>\n  intent.  It might help you to think of it from her point of view.  What<br/>\n  is she feeling when she&#39;s having a difficult moment?  If you can think,<br/>\n  &quot;she&#39;s angry, frustrated, unsure, insecure, afraid,&quot; etc. you can think<br/>\n  of her as someone who could use your help, instead of someone who is<br/>\n  attacking you.<br/>\n  While this might not help you know how to deal with every situation it<br/>\n  can help you detach from feeling assaulted.  When you aren&#39;t feeling like<br/>\n  you&#39;re under attack, you might have more energy to try to find a way to<br/>\n  communicate with her.  You can&#39;t control her big emotions but you can<br/>\n  control how you let yourself react to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She loves you Sherri-Lee.  She is not trying to hurt you.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  want to feel this way any more than you do.  She doesn&#39;t want you to be<br/>\n  unhappy with her.   She is trying to cope with the emotional situation<br/>\n  she  finds herself in and she doesn&#39;t know any other way.  She is very<br/>\n  much trying to communicate something to you, and because you&#39;re tired and<br/>\n  naturally worried you&#39;re not making whatever connections she&#39;s needing<br/>\n  you to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Talk to the list about it more, if you have the time to do that and I<br/>\n  know you&#39;ll get some support and ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Deb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

If<br/>\nyou are now nine months pregnant or a new mom you&#39;re probably exhausted<br/>\nand under a lot of stress.  I know it&#39;s hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling means not doing school.  Your daughter is young, not even<br/>\nschool age.  Would it help to think of how you would be living with her<br/>\nif you&#39;d never heard of unschooling?  What things would you be doing<br/>\ndifferently and would they ensure the peaceful family situation you<br/>\ndesire? <br/>\nApplying the unschooling philosophy to parenting is an extension of<br/>\nunschooling that some parents are not comfortable with.  You don&#39;t need<br/>\nanyone&#39;s approval to parent the way you want to.   You get to make all<br/>\nthe choices about how you live with your daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause she&#39;s very young, and you are under a lot of stress, (and have<br/>\nyou said you&#39;re husband is older and not always supportive when you&#39;d<br/>\nlike reassurance?)  it&#39;s possible that the difficulties you&#39;re having are<br/>\nnot as related to unschooling as they seem to be right now.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a post in August (?) you expressed some of the same frustrations, that<br/>\nshe&#39;s quite demanding and you don&#39;t always know how to handle that.   <br/>\n   <br/>\nShe&#39;s so little, she has a mama who&#39;s worn out from pregnancy and not<br/>\nable to do as many things as she wants.  She might be feeling lonely. <br/>\nShe&#39;s probably frustrated and angry.  It so hard to have a lot of anger<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re little, it&#39;s such a big emotion and it makes you feel so<br/>\nyucky and it&#39;s so hard to not just let it out all over the closest person<br/>\nyou can find.  Even adults do this after a lot of years on the planet and<br/>\na lot of experience with communication. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve used some tough words &quot;rude, mouthy, obnoxious...&quot;  and while I<br/>\ndon&#39;t doubt that is what it feels like to you, I don&#39;t think that is her<br/>\nintent.  It might help you to think of it from her point of view.  What<br/>\nis she feeling when she&#39;s having a difficult moment?  If you can think,<br/>\n&quot;she&#39;s angry, frustrated, unsure, insecure, afraid,&quot; etc. you can think<br/>\nof her as someone who could use your help, instead of someone who is<br/>\nattacking you.   <br/>\nWhile this might not help you know how to deal with every situation it<br/>\ncan help you detach from feeling assaulted.  When you aren&#39;t feeling like<br/>\nyou&#39;re under attack, you might have more energy to try to find a way to<br/>\ncommunicate with her.  You can&#39;t control her big emotions but you can<br/>\ncontrol how you let yourself react to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe loves you Sherri-Lee.  She is not trying to hurt you.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to feel this way any more than you do.  She doesn&#39;t want you to be<br/>\nunhappy with her.   She is trying to cope with the emotional situation<br/>\nshe  finds herself in and she doesn&#39;t know any other way.  She is very<br/>\nmuch trying to communicate something to you, and because you&#39;re tired and<br/>\nnaturally worried you&#39;re not making whatever connections she&#39;s needing<br/>\nyou to make. <br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to the list about it more, if you have the time to do that and I<br/>\nknow you&#39;ll get some support and ideas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195508922,"authorName":"wieldingwords@bellsouth.net","from":"&lt;wieldingwords@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097450073","msgId":3487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDEwMjMxNDMzLktNQVIxNzg2LmltZjE5YWVjLm1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldEBtYWlsLmJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3483,"nextInTopic":3491,"prevInTime":3486,"nextInTime":3488,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Number one rule is that we respect each other and each other&#39;s spaces.  We each have our own room and the rule is that if you are asked to not come in someone&#39;s space then you are to honor that request.  We also don&#39;t go into each other&#39;s spaces when the owner of that space isn&#39;t in the room (or given permission for entrance.)  We expect each other to be kind and respectful.  Respect is a major part of our family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust reading what you have written speaks to me that your daughter used to have very set boundaries and then suddenly there were no boundaries and she may feel lost.  She sees &quot;yes&quot; as &quot;everything my way or I make everyone miserable&quot; rather than realizing that other people exist in the her world and if she wants people to be want to do things for her and with her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs she an only child?  Who does she play with on a daily/weekly basis?  Does she have a peer group, siblings, cousins?  Do you have a local homeschool or resource group that you meet with on a regular basis?  Are there friends in the neighborhood that she can play with who are homeschooled or who are free to come play after school and on weekends?  Have you talked to her about how you are feeling abused and come to a negotiation of what is acceptable for all of you.  Obviously being her sole source of entertainment isn&#39;t working for you and you need to work together to find other sources of entertainment or ways for her to entertain herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI raised my children with gentle guidance.  I subscribe to a very AP style of parenting.  That doesn&#39;t mean that there are no rules and no &quot;nos.&quot;  Not because I feel that children &quot;need&quot; nos but because yeses don&#39;t always work or are appropriate.   For instance a &quot;totally chocolate dinner&quot; isn&#39;t sound nutrition (although I&#39;m working on it LOL!)  and the kids can&#39;t go play out in the street (for obvious safety reasons).  Sometimes I don&#39;t have the energy to be able to do that one last project or am busy with household activities (floors need to be washed and bills do need to be paid periodically) and so a &quot;no&quot; or a &quot;later&quot; is the answer.  Obviously expenses also play into the picture.  My kids have been raised with thrift store and discount rack shopping and know that if we want some of the luxuries that we have in our family that asking for a $40 pair of jeans isn&#39;t going to get them far when I can buy practically an entire winter wardrobe at the thrift store for the same amount.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think before abandoning the entire &quot;unschooling lifestyle&quot; that you can re-evaluate what parts are and aren&#39;t working for you.  It may be that your daughter needs a bit more structure or guidelines to work with.  She may be feeling like a toddler and trying to figure out what her boundaries are and is confused because she doesn&#39;t seem to have any or they are very inconsistant.  Families have to work as a whole and that includes the parents.  If she isn&#39;t treating you with respect as a person (not just as her parent) then something isn&#39;t working for all of you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so long.  I just sense that there is an unhappy confused little girl and a tired stressed-out mommy and there can be a way to balance your world a little better without completely abandoning what can be a great family environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] since I started saying yes....","postDate":"1097444384","msgId":3483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDEwMjEzOTM0LldUVkYyNDk3Lm10YTkuYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0QGxlaWdoPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDBJNUUwMDM2ODA2UUE4QGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":3482,"nextInTopic":3487,"prevInTime":3482,"nextInTime":3484,"topicId":3480,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sherri-Lee, It sounds to me like you don t have any personal boundaries.

As much as I<br/>\nam happy to wait on my children and say yes as often as possible, I will not<br/>\nreact kindly if I am treated poorly. Maybe it&#39;s my rebellious personality,<br/>\nbut when I am treated badly, I don&#39;t have any desire to help out the person<br/>\ndoing it and I&#39;d be clear about that.    If I asked my children (which I do<br/>\noften) if they&#39;d like me to bring them something to eat before I sit down or<br/>\ngo exercise and they say no and change their mind after, I would suggest<br/>\nthey find themselves something or wait until the next time that I am up. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure why your dd is acting like she is acting but it sounds like<br/>\nsomething more serious is under all that anger.  If my child were acting<br/>\nlike that, I wouldn&#39;t want to be around her either and I would make that<br/>\nclear.  If one of my children treated their siblings like that, I would<br/>\nintervene and tell them they can&#39;t treat them like that.  They don&#39;t deserve<br/>\nto be treated so poorly and I would separate them and try to figure out what<br/>\ncaused the trouble to begin with.  You are no different.  You don&#39;t deserve<br/>\nto be treated so badly and I would be the first one to tell her that.  But,<br/>\nyou also need to get to the bottom of why she is feeling the need to be so<br/>\ncontrolling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I am just reading into what you wrote, but it sounds like you had lots<br/>\nof rules and then dropped them completely without making her aware of your<br/>\npersonal boundaries.

And if I tried<br/>\nto talk to her about sharing and thinking of other people, she blew a<br/>\nraspberry at me or stuck her fingers in her ears or some other rude action<br/>\nthat just was over the top.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think I expect anyone here to have any answers for me, I just<br/>\nthought at least here it was in context, where some of my other lists would<br/>\nsuggest time outs and spanking which I am not prepared to go to right yet,<br/>\nalthough I know my family (including dh) thinks I am a lunatic for taking<br/>\nsuch abuse from her as I do. And yes before you jump on me, it is abusive<br/>\nsometimes, her demands are so over the top and impossible to achieve that it<br/>\nis too much. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI will ask her if she is hungry, no she will say I will suggest things. no<br/>\nthank you she will say, then as soon as I sit down, she wants me to get her<br/>\nsomething to eat. She doesn&#39;t know what it is though, I have to help her<br/>\ndecide, but everything I suggest is not only rejected but rejected in<br/>\nscreaming, with anger at me for being so stupid I can&#39;t read her mind. When<br/>\nI say I have no more suggestions, she screams and berates me and tells me I<br/>\nHAVE to get her something to eat or she won&#39;t love me or something else. So<br/>\nI stay calm and ask her what she wants and make suggestions again and so it<br/>\ncontinues.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI hate this. Where has my pleasant child gone?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is sending this with trepidation about putting these raw thoughts on<br/>\nthis list, but really can&#39;t talk to anyone else about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3562,"nextTopicId":3536}}
