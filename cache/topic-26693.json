To this end, I<br/>\nhold M&M duels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure,<br/>\nsqueezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That<br/>\nis the &quot;loser,&quot; and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner<br/>\ngets to go another round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and<br/>\nthe newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that<br/>\nthe blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of<br/>\ncompetition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or<br/>\npointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to<br/>\nbe a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra<br/>\nstrength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the<br/>\nstrongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as<br/>\nwell, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A<br/>\nDivision of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with<br/>\na 3x5 card reading, &quot;Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free<br/>\n1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this &quot;grant money.&quot; I have set<br/>\naside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we<br/>\nwill discover the True Champion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be only one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* it&#39;s NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial<br/>\ninterests<br/>\n<br/>\nPostingID: 409930561<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom &quot;Best of Craigs List&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/tpa/409930561.html\">http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/tpa/409930561.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26080,"nextTopicId":26654}}
