Let a teacher do everything, so that all you have to do is to <br/>\nmake sure he gets his homework done.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr to do school-at-home where you buy the curriculum, follow the <br/>\nsyllabus, give the tests, and make pretty check-marks.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling requires a LOT more effort on the parents&#39; parts. It <br/>\nrequires that you actually KNOW your children. That you GO with your <br/>\nchildren. That you DO with your children. That you BE with your <br/>\nchildren. That you FIND the learning that isn&#39;t always readily apparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s like PLAY! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems as though I am on the edge...and trying to decide whether or<br/>\nnot to take the leap.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJump off the cliff, and you will find your wings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still some things I would like to<br/>\nsee my kids do which they would not choose to do on their own accord,<br/>\nat this time atleast (writing is the main thing).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat need do they have of writing at this time?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo they not write at all? IMs? Emails? Letters? Birthday cards? Grocery <br/>\nlists? Christmas wish lists?<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize  it&#39;s hard to take this advice. Cameron left school at 12 and <br/>\ntold me he would never read or write again. It took 6 years (well, he <br/>\n*did* write IMs a lot at first), but he really didn&#39;t read books (he <br/>\nread online a lot---and magazines) or write (except Ims and emails). <br/>\nBut at 18, he read his first book, cover-to-cover, by himself. It was <br/>\nRue&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child, An Unschooled Life. Then he read <br/>\nStargirl. Then Siddhartha! Then...well, now he&#39;s rarely without a book <br/>\nin his hands or in his backpack. Suddenly he started writing in a <br/>\njournal. Every day. Now he&#39;s writing articles for magazines! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have MADE him read and write all those six years, but none of <br/>\nthat would have had any meaning to him. He would have been doing it for <br/>\n*me*, not for *him*. NOW it&#39;s real and important to him. And he can&#39;t <br/>\nget enough. He&#39;s QUICKLY making up for &quot;lost time.&quot; But, in fact, <br/>\n*nothing* was lost. He was busy doing other things. He has his whole <br/>\nlife to learn stuff. Only in school is there a time table (or times <br/>\ntables! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I just feel hesitant, and at this very moment I am having a hard time<br/>\npinpointing exactly why.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody in the family---or a close friend---questioning you?

My older son, in <br/>\nparticular, was miserable in 1st grade and when the school mentioned <br/>\nhim being *dyslexic* I knew it was time to pull him out.  He also has <br/>\nbehaviors frequently associated with Asperger syndrome.  In any case, <br/>\nover the course of the past 4 years of homeschooling, I am feeling <br/>\nmyself drawn more and more to an unschooling lifestyle with my kids.  <br/>\nReading on this list, I see that my parenting style is already <br/>\ncompatible with unschooling.  For example we do not punish/reward and <br/>\nbedtime is a fluid element in our lives.   The thing is though.....I <br/>\nam a worrier.  I do not know how else to sum it up.  I WORRY about <br/>\nwhether or not I am doing them a terrible dis-service.   <br/>\n<br/>\nA story I remind myself of often:<br/>\nWhen I took my older son out of 1st grade thinking he was dyslexic, I <br/>\nwas beside myself trying to do the *right* thing for hiim to learn <br/>\nhow to read.  He hated any program we tried.  He hated going to the <br/>\nlibrary.  He hated even looking at print.  I finally stopped trying <br/>\nto teach him how to read.   He enjoyed audio books, so I provided <br/>\nthem as much as possible (I love the public library system).  And he <br/>\nlearned how to read just fine--all on his own, in his room, I have no <br/>\nidea how he did it, but now he reads great.  He even has great <br/>\nfluency when he reads out loud.  SO...I have this knowledge and <br/>\nhistory.  I know they are both capable of learning.  I have <br/>\nexperienced first had *letting go* of teaching him, and letting him <br/>\nlearn at his own pace and with great joy instead of all the <br/>\nfrustration he had before.   I am just not sure I am prepared to take <br/>\non the full responsibility...of unschooling.  People  say it requires <br/>\nmuch parent involvment and interaction to carry through on their <br/>\ninterests and desires.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems as though I am on the edge...and trying to decide whether or <br/>\nnot to take the leap.  There are still some things I would like to <br/>\nsee my kids do which they would not choose to do on their own accord, <br/>\nat this time atleast (writing is the main thing).  For the past 3 <br/>\nmonths or so I have not used any *curriculum* although even before <br/>\nthat we were pretty slim on using it.   Their self directed learning <br/>\nis quite varied.  Board games, computer games, gardening, science <br/>\nexperiments (today they made whirlpools out of a magnetic stirrer and <br/>\nfound some old pH paper which they messed around with for a bit).  <br/>\nSometimes they spontaneously graph things...like the number of peas <br/>\nper pod.  One son loves logic problems, word problems, mazes, games.  <br/>\nOne loves making better glues.   They are active and happy.  Despite <br/>\nthis and my experience with my older son learning how to read, I just <br/>\nfeel hesitant, and at this very moment I am having a hard time <br/>\npinpointing exactly why.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe forums here are incredibly interesting to read.  Ya&#39;ll are a <br/>\nfiesty group.  =)  I also enjoy the many links to blogs.  Most of the <br/>\n*unschoolers* I have met recently have younger children.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I know...RELAX and take a deep breath.
