And no, they dont live together in their own place, and one of them is 17. He lives with his parents and five y/o unschooled brother. The other guy also lives with his parents. I don&#39;t know why the older one was at NBTSC, because he is over 18, but apparently Grace allowed him to come back because he loves the camp so much. My daughter did spend two weeks at camp with these guys so she is pretty comfortable with them, but I know what you mean. It may be intense to be with them all day 24/7. I do agree it would be better for her to have her own base, but I am not sure I could swing that. The plan is to stay with the younger guy mainly and then head up to Wasilla to visit the older guy for a few days. I&#39;m still checking it all out and who knows the whole plan may end up in the wash. I would love for her to see the Northern Lights. Alaska is absolutely stunning. She was there when she was five. I got a job up there in 1997 flying air<br/>\ntours in Denali park. I drove up from California towing a trailer and took both my girls, who were aged 4 and 7 at the time. We stayed in Healy for the summer. Everyone thought I was crazy to travel alone with my girls all the way up the Alcan highway through Canada but it was a great time and everything went well. They loved it up there.<br/>\nI just really need to check out these families before I agree to it. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:debra.rossing@...\">debra.rossing@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nIf it was my DD, I&#39;d get in touch with their family and, among other<br/>\nthings, make sure it&#39;s Ok with them to have a houseguest.
