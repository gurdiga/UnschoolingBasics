We don&#39;t have &quot;dessert&quot;....we have meals.  Our meals always have a mix of foods.  Protein, sweets, baked goods, etc..  The problem was that Zach simply wouldn&#39;t eat them.  He would come sit at the table, look at the food and take his plate and leave the table.  He would then go scrounging through the pantry and get something pre-packaged and full of sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had done all the grating carrots into spaghetti sauce, making zucchini muffins, etc..  But it didn&#39;t make much difference because if it didn&#39;t come pre-packaged, Zach wasn&#39;t going to eat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time he was 2, we were already talking to nutritionists and doctors because Zach went from a fat, happy baby on the bottle (Zach was adopted and nursing wasn&#39;t an option due to legal issues in his particular case) to a toddler that simply refused to eat more than a bite or two of anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat down with Zach and talked to him about my concerns.  I asked him to make me a list of things he felt he would eat if we had them for meals.  I made absolutely sure that every meal contained at least one of those things along with other stuff.  He still wouldn&#39;t eat it.  I asked him to simply just try things and perhaps he would like them.  He refused.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no, I didn&#39;t just sit there.   I came to the lists, asked for guidance, got some that I thought was good (take food to where he is, etc.), I followed the advice.  It would work for a time or two and then stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then because the food was an issue with Zach it started in with the other younger kids.  Not nearly to the extreme of Zach but following along.  I had to put my foot down.  We no longer buy pre-packaged sugar stuff at all....which of course is penalizing the children that handle their food choices quite well.  We don&#39;t have soda.  Even if we have fruit juice, Zach will drink it like there is no tomorrow and not eat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Zach isn&#39;t just like this about food, he is like this about everything.  He wants what he wants when he wants it.  He doesn&#39;t listen to reason.  Out of all the children who have lived with us, he is only one that I have to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....<br/>\n<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t have any food restrictions<br/>\nwe talked about nutrition<br/>\nI made the food Zach professed to like<br/>\nI made sweet things packed with nutrition<br/>\nI talked to nutritionists and doctors<br/>\nI tried taking food to where he was<br/>\nI made the other kids do without so Zach wouldn&#39;t be tempted<br/>\n<br/>\nI really don&#39;t know what else you would have had me do.  Exactly what would have been &quot;doing my job&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: k &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:katherand2003@...\">katherand2003@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Monday, November 7, 2005 11:05 am<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] good eater WAS Unschooling??
