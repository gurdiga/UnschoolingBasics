When I married Gary, Will was 10 and in public school.  By the time we found homeschooling, Will was 16, Andy was almost 5 (and already pre-registered for kindergarten) and Dan was just a few months old.  When we made the decision to take Will out of school, life immediately got easier - and our marriage was less stressful.  Three months later, we decided to keep Andy home from school and our life continued to be easier than what it was when Will was in school, both when I was single and married.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI find that during the years our kids are young, we don&#39;t have as much &#39;adult&#39; time as we did before the younger boys came along.  Then again, we&#39;ve never known a time without at least one child, since Will was a toddler when we began dating.  I look at our life now, and I know if we had to add homework, enforced bedtimes and all the madness that goes into getting even one child out the door to school every day, we&#39;d all be miserable.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI can say absolutely that choosing not to send our kids to school has been good for our marriage.  Of course, we&#39;re unschoolers -- I can see where if I was trying to keep up with a curriculum, assignments and other activities deemed necessary by so many school-at-home families, my marriage (and my sanity) would suffer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n <br/>\nThe opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, it is conformity -- Rollo May<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
