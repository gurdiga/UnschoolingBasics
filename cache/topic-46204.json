It has really helped me see what is important here. <br/>\nAfter forwarding my mom some of the emails and replies I received from the ppl on this list, my mom has agreed to allow her out of the virtual school :) She also sounds on board with unschooling although we need to talk a little more about it as I dont think she fully understands it. My only worry now is that I have no idea how long my sister is going to be here, living with me. I am not going to get too far out into the future right now and just focus on her creating and allowing her space/time to heal, the best I can. I think a part of me was/is fearing my husbands voice saying she needs structure, she needs to follow through on her decision, she needs to learn she cant just do whatever she wants, she needs responsibility, etc etc. Which btw is just self talk in my own head that I have created. Not that he wont say any of that but we will work through his opinions. He agreed to read raising our children, raising ourselves and the Sandra Dodd unschooling book, which BTW I am currently loving :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to talk to my husband....not sure how that is going to go.

She sounds precocious and I tend to think of precociousness, particularly sexual precociousness, as being a product of a very difficult life. There are some interesting articles on predictors of early age at sexual maturity in girls. One of the big predictive factors is a real sense that their lives are short. &lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ##################<br/>\n&gt; I think you hit the nail on the head here. It certainly brought tears to my eyes. It has not been easy. My mother was an abused child growing up and kicked out at age 15. She has been carrying that baggage around for a long time. She is depressed, very dependent and scared of the world around here. This is what my sis has been growing up with. My sisters father has never been around, she has prob seen him a whole month out of her life. She has told me she plans to die of a morphine OD when she is 15. She feels she has no purpose and nothing does for that matter. Yet she was telling me how upset she was that her friend was smoking pot after she asked him to stop. I know she doesnt really want that but feels helpless maybe.<br/>\n&gt; ##################<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if you want to, to present the idea of deschooling your sister to your mom. Talk about how she needs time not feeling pressured to get to a point where she may be more interested in the world of learning. I believe the standard time table is a month for every year in school. So at 14 that would be 9 months without any educational expectations or goals. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ##################<br/>\n&gt; How does one go about taking 9 months off and not getting into &#39;trouble&#39; with the school police? This is my moms biggest fear but if I can convince her there is no threat then she may let go and trust me a bit more.<br/>\n&gt; ##################<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;At 14 I was still a bit boy shy. But maybe she&#39;d like to go get makeup, or have a family pedicure, or watch some of the movies that Sandra has on the page about deschooling that I linked. Or watch different movies. Maybe you can pamper her and coddle her as she may never have really experienced before. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; #######################<br/>\n&gt; Since she has been here I have colored her hair, took her for makeup, had movie time (even though she is texting the whole time) but I feel myself withdrawing a bit on that when she lies and acts helpless when she is asked to clean her bathroom and bedroom. She likes to play dumb a lot so ppl do things for her. She is far from dumb or incapable. She also starts to act entitled or something when I give and do for her so much. She gets this attitude when I actually have to say no due to financial reasons or the fact that I have 3 LOs. This makes me angry. I know that is my issue but I guess I dont understand the whole dynamic of what is really going on. Living here, at least at this point in time requires her to keep her shared bathroom clean and to chip in with the house. This was my husbands &#39;prerequisite&#39; for her coming here. He still thinks life is all about structure and discipline (Working on this, just got &quot;Raising our children, Raising Ourselves.). Boy do I have my hands full. I love my sister like she is my own child. When she was born I was 16 and to me, then, I really felt like she was and worked 3 jobs to help my mom. It has been a struggle for the past 14 years to not be her mom and be her sister but with the age gap, my own issues and my love for her, it is really hard to know my place. And of course everyone is loaded with opinions on this idea, none of which I fully agree with at this point.<br/>\n&gt; ############################<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hypocrite Unschooling and peaceful parenting with my kids but not with my 14 sis","postDate":"1298325124","msgId":46224,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PEE4NEM1RkUwLTA1RjMtNDIzRi1BNDNELUI4MjcwMkEwOTAyOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":46223,"nextInTopic":46225,"prevInTime":46223,"nextInTime":46225,"topicId":46204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes!

She wants the world to be soooooo much better than it is.

Look into guardianship, maybe, or emancipated minor status. If that&#39;s going to cause difficulties (and yes, I know what kind of &quot;difficulities&quot; dysfunctional families bring, the state is nothing compared to a freaking out bio mom) research things like umbrella schools, since some of those are unschooling-friendly.

She bounced around in public school. She came to us and went to school for 1 and 1/2 years. We then started doing school at home. Didn&#39;t see things any different then her being in school. So now we have moved into unschooling. She is a sweet kid, but not very in tune with her needs. She has yet to find something she really wants to do. Which i feel keeps her more immature for her age. She tends to act more like a 4-6 year old on most days. But since starting unschooling she has been able to let go of expectations. She is starting to explore things with my help. It is a start. <br/>\n  Leading me to this. 14 is not too young. Is 14 to early to start exploring life? That is a matter of opinion. When we adopted our kids we set our minds to providing these children a home and family. We agreed that if working at McDonalds was their best. Then that was better then what they had. If you look at your sisters future what do you see right now? Probably a pregnant drop out. What is one step up from that. A pregnant graduate. Or perhaps a non pregnant drop out. Set your own goals for your sister one step up from where you see her now. Then you can feel like you are making a difference in her life and also not expect so much out of her. <br/>\n  I also have a 14 year old brother who I also helped out with a lot when he was a baby. I was 15 when he was born. My mom was a single mom. Struggling to pay bills. I was a big part of his life. Still am. My mother also looks to me for advice for him. He is a super smart kid and wont do his schoolwork (public school for him) and fails because he wont turn in homework or do classwork. She recently got a boyfriend who had higher expectations making things difficult. I felt so bad for him and was hurting to see him struggling with everything.  But you have to think of what the child is going through. Thats a lot of change. Same for your sister. Sounds like she has a lot going on in her life. My advice to my mother was again to lower the expectations. D is passing. So praise D schoolwork. becauase she just wants him to pass at this point. So she started doing this and since then the relationship with the boyfriend has started to grow and his grades have actually come up. <br/>\n  We can&#39;t always expect doctors or lawyers. Not saying that you are.  Sometimes we need to focus on change. One step at a time. It hurts to see our loved ones on a path that we think is failing. But again it&#39;s not our path to take. You don&#39;t know what they are learning on that path at that moment. A different way is not a wrong way. It&#39;s just a different way. Try not to focus on fixing your sister as much as showing her you care. At 14 and being a girl she may not show appreciation but it will still leave a lasting impression within her.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Nevada specific Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Hypocrite Unschooling and peaceful parenting with my kids but not with my 14 sis","postDate":"1298240756","msgId":46216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTc2Ni44MDI1NC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqczBqNStiOWVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqczBqNStiOWVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46214,"nextInTopic":46217,"prevInTime":46215,"nextInTime":46217,"topicId":46204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Looking through the web page (http://nevadahomeschoolnetwork.com/laws/) I previously linked I found this about the letter of intent: The parent of a child who","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1413044384\">Looking through the web page (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nevadahomeschoolnetwork.com/laws/)\">http://nevadahomeschoolnetwork.com/laws/)</a> I <br/>\npreviously linked I found this about the letter of intent: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The parent of a child who is being homeschooled shall prepare an  educational <br/>\nplan of instruction for the child in the subject areas of  English, including <br/>\nreading, composition and writing, mathematics,  science and social studies, <br/>\nincluding history, geography, economics and  government, as appropriate for the <br/>\nage and level of skill of the child  as determined by the parent.

She&#39;s a very needy girl from what you&#39;ve <br/>\nwritten. It will take a long time for her bucket to be full, or even look like <br/>\nthere&#39;s much in it. It may help if you imagine how you would have felt at 14 to <br/>\nhave someone care for you like you are offering to care for your sister. It may <br/>\nhelp for you to think about how it makes you feel to be kind to her instead of <br/>\nhoping that she will be grateful in that moment. She may never really appreciate <br/>\nwhat you are doing for her. She may never be able to heal from what has come <br/>\nbefore. She may though. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could help her to clean the bathroom. You could offer to do it with her, ask <br/>\nher to come and help. You could get everyone in the bathroom and make it a <br/>\nbathroom cleaning party! You could make it a very easy space for your sister to <br/>\ncope with, or for you to clean if need be.

I am currently reading the Sandra Dodd Big book of unschooling and she basically even says at this age it is too late if you learning at a slow pace.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  Angel, has now come to realize she has to actually do more work than she did in school. In school, she just went and did the bare min., I feel like I just cant force her. nor do I want to, into completing her work. It is taking a lot out of me, naturally. But I cant just let her drop out of school now or my mom will have to deal with the consequences.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  She just doesnt appear to have any interests. She is so full of &#39;I cants&#39;  and &#39;NOs&#39; about everything. I feel like she is just screaming for attention but I dont know how to give it to her when she is so resistant of everything.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I really feel like a hypocrite but not sure how to handle a teenager that was raised the way she was and force her to do exactly what I do not agree with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I live in Nevada and I dont know the laws really yet for high school homeschoolers.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I may be able to convince my mom to let me get her off this virtual school if I cant successfully report what they need to hear but something about this makes me nervous since I have to answer to my mom and husband about her &#39;success&#39; ahhh I am sorry my post is not very focused. Right now I am not very focused and confused. Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any ideas or other schooling options that she may actually want to do? Anyone know the laws here in NV? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening to my rant.<br/>\n&gt; -Christina<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hypocrite Unschooling and peaceful parenting with my kids but not with my 14 sis","postDate":"1298195475","msgId":46205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYzNzkyNS4yNTg4MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlqcWVqaytsa2F2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlqcWVqaytsa2F2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46204,"nextInTopic":46206,"prevInTime":46204,"nextInTime":46206,"topicId":46204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t know anything about the laws for Nevada.

Google got me to here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nevadahomeschoolnetwork.com/laws/.\">http://nevadahomeschoolnetwork.com/laws/.</a> On the Nevada Homeschool Network&#39;s FAQ <br/>\npdf it states: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n16. Can someone else homeschool my child?<br/>\nOne cannot “have” their child homeschooled by someone else. NRS 385.007 #3 and<br/>\nNRS 392.070 #1b define homeschooling, and when combined: &quot;Homeschooled child<br/>\nmeans a child who receives instruction at home... (when) A parent of the child <br/>\nchooses to<br/>\nprovide education to the child...&quot; The parent assumes full responsibility for <br/>\nthe education<br/>\nof their child by signing the Notice of Intent to Homeschool, and must provide <br/>\nthe<br/>\neducation. Providing the education means the parent can do their own teaching, <br/>\nor use<br/>\nothers (such as a tutor), or have the child take classes (such as at a <br/>\nhomeschool co-op, a<br/>\nprivate or public school, a civic or community group, a private organization, <br/>\netc), or use a<br/>\ncorrespondence or on-line course, or do whatever else the parent deems <br/>\nnecessary. The<br/>\nparent, not another person, organization, or school, is the one who has direct <br/>\nmanagerial<br/>\ncontrol of the child&#39;s education.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what this means about your position as administrator of your <br/>\nsister&#39;s homeschooling curriculum. But it may be worth your looking into. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you homeschooling your sister while unschooling your own children? I <br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine that the one will help the other or vice versa. Did you offer in a <br/>\nmoment of hopefulness that you could make your sister&#39;s struggles easier? You <br/>\nmay need to reassess. Did your sister want to leave school and come and live <br/>\nwith you to homeschool? Or was it a kind of threat to get her to straighten up <br/>\nand fly right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is very, very difficult to force someone else to do something that <br/>\nyou don&#39;t believe in. It&#39;s why my children aren&#39;t in school, and why they are <br/>\nunschooled. Having to force someone else to follow the dictates of a structure <br/>\nyou don&#39;t believe in must be incredibly difficult. What happens if she fails? <br/>\nWhat happens if she were to fail at school? Nevada doesn&#39;t require testing of <br/>\nhomeschooled children, which would suggest that her failure at correspondence <br/>\nschool wouldn&#39;t be a major factor in her ability to homeschool. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you produce a list of activities and exciting things to do that get all of <br/>\nyou out of the house and exploring more? Can you help your sister to achieve her <br/>\nneed for social time with her friends more? Facebook is an amazing tool, texting <br/>\nand being able to keep in touch with friends may help if she&#39;s moved away from <br/>\nwhere they live. Or is less able to see them because of the constraints of her <br/>\nlife with you. Can you help her to enjoy what she likes to do more instead of <br/>\nworking so hard to implement the educational system that you are working to move <br/>\naway from? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDid she get out of school and then was immediately enrolled in a correspondence <br/>\nschool? One of the frequent pieces of homeschooling understanding is the idea of <br/>\ndeschooling. You give someone a chance to just be after they&#39;ve gotten out of <br/>\nschool. Supporting them in their interests, but not pressing them to do anything <br/>\nthat looks like school. If her education is being used as a weapon to <br/>\ndemonstrate that she needs to buckle down and not be such a social butterfly who <br/>\nis just getting by with the minimum that she can get by with, there is very <br/>\nlittle chance for you to help her. If, instead, your mother and her husband are <br/>\ninterested in helping your sister to become more willing to engage with the <br/>\nworld, you could talk to them about deschooling and giving her time to really <br/>\nheal from the intense damage that school and failing at school can do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome deschooling links that may help: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a>  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/getting_started/what_is_deschooling.htm\">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca/unschooling/getting_started/what_is_deschooling.htm</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pattiedeschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/pattiedeschooling</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070220063843/http://home.rmci.net/abell/page11.htm\">http://web.archive.org/web/20070220063843/http://home.rmci.net/abell/page11.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(all of those, but the first one, are stemming from Sandra&#39;s original page, if <br/>\nyou read that and follow her links you&#39;ll have done all that I just did)<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328683493,"authorName":"naturalmommyx3","from":"&quot;naturalmommyx3&quot; &lt;naturalmommyx2@...&gt;","profile":"naturalmommyx3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Hypocrite Unschooling and peaceful parenting with my kids but not with my 14 sis","postDate":"1298185652","msgId":46204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlqcWVqaytsa2F2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46205,"prevInTime":46203,"nextInTime":46205,"topicId":46204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In advance I will apologize for the length of this.

I have hesitated to write this for 2 weeks now, writing and rewriting, ahhh! <br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to un-schooling and feel like a big hypocrite. My kids are 4,3,1 and my 14 year old sister is now on her fourth week living with us. My sister, Angel, came to live with me while she started Homeschooling through a virtual school.  To keep this short here is how things are going:<br/>\nShe lies about doing her work<br/>\nI have to nag everyday all day about her completing school tasks<br/>\nResorted to making her turn her phone off while working and denying her of going to see friends on weekends, etc.<br/>\nShe began doing her work in the late/early morning hours while Facebooking and texting.<br/>\nShe appears to have no interests and feels hopeless and admits she has no self esteem.<br/>\nLiterally she texts non stop, during movies, eating out together, EVERYTHING she does she only takes seconds of breaks inbetween. She barely can listen or hold a face to face conversation cause of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a talk with her and she just has no interest and wants to drop out but she is not old enough. So, I just feel so confused, here I am learning to unschool and learning peaceful parenting with my kids but doing the complete opposite with my sister. I feel like she is too old to begin un-schooling since I am in my learning stages and am only applying tidbits of knowledge at this point. I am currently reading the Sandra Dodd Big book of unschooling and she basically even says at this age it is too late if you learning at a slow pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n Angel, has now come to realize she has to actually do more work than she did in school. In school, she just went and did the bare min., I feel like I just cant force her. nor do I want to, into completing her work. It is taking a lot out of me, naturally. But I cant just let her drop out of school now or my mom will have to deal with the consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\n She just doesnt appear to have any interests. She is so full of &#39;I cants&#39;  and &#39;NOs&#39; about everything. I feel like she is just screaming for attention but I dont know how to give it to her when she is so resistant of everything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really feel like a hypocrite but not sure how to handle a teenager that was raised the way she was and force her to do exactly what I do not agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI live in Nevada and I dont know the laws really yet for high school homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be able to convince my mom to let me get her off this virtual school if I cant successfully report what they need to hear but something about this makes me nervous since I have to answer to my mom and husband about her &#39;success&#39; ahhh I am sorry my post is not very focused. Right now I am not very focused and confused. Has anyone been through a similar situation? Any ideas or other schooling options that she may actually want to do?
