If so, you don&#39;t<br/>\nneed to contact anyone. As far as the state is<br/>\nconcerned unschooling is a form of homeschooling. It&#39;s<br/>\na form that officials don&#39;t like. So most of us in<br/>\nstates that have strict reporting guidelines don&#39;t say<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; anywhere in our reporting.
