There  <br/>\nare no other definitions of other means, so it leaves it wide open  <br/>\nfor us. There are no requirements, no reporting, no testing. It does  <br/>\nstate that it should take 180 days (minus five days for &#39;teacher  <br/>\ntraining&#39;) of instruction, but there are no guidelines for curriculum  <br/>\nor level reached.
