What nudged me in this direction is that my dd <br/>\nexpressed an interest not long ago in getting out more and meeting <br/>\nmore teens.   This group has a teen session.  We initially went to <br/>\ntheir monthly dance (which she had a hard time getting involved in, <br/>\nbeing HS (&quot;highly sensitive&quot;), like Tonya&#39;s ds, we&#39;re both on Anne <br/>\nO&#39;s group &quot;shine&quot;!)).  They were really great about hooking her up <br/>\nwith a couple of kids who weren&#39;t into dancing and were playing a <br/>\ngame, but she kept going back to the dance area to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has a schooled friend in another town who goes to dances at her <br/>\nschool often, has many friends, and I think part of her feels she&#39;s <br/>\nmissing out on something (they talk almost every day).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe never got up to dance (I hung with the parents in another room, <br/>\nchecked in a couple of times or the parents let me know, I had <br/>\nexplained her difficulties and they were really great about it), but <br/>\non the way home she said she really WANTED to, she just couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbring herself to do it and she regretted it.   We talked about it at <br/>\nlength, and also that she&#39;d like to go another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis group is more &quot;homeschoolish&quot;, with &quot;study groups, no tests, a <br/>\nvariety of things offered, also with the hanging out part as well, <br/>\nbut we decided against it because of the distance, and also the <br/>\ncommute home in the late afternoon would be on the highway in rush <br/>\nhour traffic.   Plus not knowing anyone, she would rather get to <br/>\nknow some of the kids first, and IF she connects, THEN we&#39;ll <br/>\nconsider it (not the other way around, as many &quot;schooled&quot; kids or <br/>\nkids who &quot;fit in&quot; easily would do).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And he says &quot;I&#39;m not learning as much as other kids my age are.

I&#39;m going to tag on to this  <br/>\nprimarily because I also have an eleven yo, but as well we have just  <br/>\nstarted homeschooling a year ago, and unschooling the past six months.<br/>\nJust wanted to let you know that we leave our 11yo home alone  <br/>\nsometimes when I have to run errands. We started with a strict  <br/>\nschedule when he was ten, running to the grocery and back his rules  <br/>\nwere no opening the door, no answering the phone, no cooking, and  <br/>\nactually he had to stay in my bedroom and watch tv, read or play  <br/>\nvideogames (our room is above the garage and has it&#39;s own bathroom,  <br/>\nfridge and phone). We&#39;ve loosened up on a lot of it, still no  <br/>\ncooking, but he can go round the house at least ;-)  It&#39;s what works  <br/>\nfor our family anyway, but everything in Norman is within 20 minutes.  <br/>\ni wouldn&#39;t drive up to the city and leave him here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds alot like what we went through with Josh, he was begging to  <br/>\nbe &#39;taught&#39;. It was all he knew, and he got a lot of reward at school  <br/>\nfrom being told how smart he was and how good he was. It was very  <br/>\nhard for him to break away from pleasing others to wanting to please  <br/>\nhimself. He&#39;s still stuck sometimes, just today he apologized to me  <br/>\nfor wasting so much of his time on mindless pursuits! I was  <br/>\nhorrified! I told him that I didn&#39;t ever think that his video games  <br/>\nor computer time was mindless, it&#39;s something he enjoys and he&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning all he can about these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure the coop is undoing all that you&#39;re trying to teach him  <br/>\nabout learning being self-evident....he&#39;s being told that there are  <br/>\nthings he can&#39;t learn without someone telling him what they are! I  <br/>\nhave some homeschooling friends, who&#39;s son told me that I should get  <br/>\nJosh Shirley grammar because &#39;it&#39;s really hard&#39;. I asked him what  <br/>\ngrammar was for and he had no idea. But they put him in a coop for  <br/>\nit, and the coop has intensified these feelings he has that grammar  <br/>\nis something everyone should learn, it should be hard, and it can&#39;t  <br/>\nbe fun. What?!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first pulled him out of school, he was a terror, trying to  <br/>\nmake me mad so I&#39;d give up and send him back to school! This was  <br/>\nstill schooling at home phase. I finally blew up one day and told him  <br/>\n&quot;NO matter how rotten or mean you act, I will not send you back to  <br/>\nschool! Now put down that math and go have some fun!&quot; Haha....he  <br/>\nyelled back at me, we got a lot out of our system, and trust me, for  <br/>\nhim that was a big step. It was the first time he ever was able to  <br/>\ncall me on my meanness. And now i&#39;ve got to go because they are  <br/>\nrunning in and out of the house to the mudpuddle.

Could he take an online class? Is there a summer reading program at your local library? Maybe he could design his own curriculum. Maybe ask him what he wants to learn and show him how to find info on those subjects on line or in the community. Just some ideas to consider.

He&#39;s going from a schooling environment to<br/>\nanother schooling environment.  We belong to a small &quot;co-op&quot; but have<br/>\nstrived to keep it very &quot;funshop&quot; oriented rather than schoolish.  The<br/>\nclasses that were a hit were those that were active, engaging and<br/>\nunstructured (namely dulcimer and drama  - which was more like a &quot;Whose Line<br/>\nis it Anyway&quot; than actual drama class!  LOL!)  There was a &quot;science class&quot;<br/>\nfor a while, but the kids quickly bored with it as the lady who was teaching<br/>\nit presented it very much like if she were in a classroom.  Lot&#39;s of fairly<br/>\nuseless information with lots of facts and figures and memorization.  :(  We<br/>\nalso have a room where the kids can just hang out.  We call it the lounge.<br/>\nThey can go there and draw, read, bounce balls, play foosball, chat, and<br/>\nchill.  Is there such an offering at this group and is your son really<br/>\nallowed to not participate?  Do you have a cell phone so that if he did stay<br/>\nhome you were an easy reach?  What do you fear would happen if he did stay<br/>\nhome?  That was something I had to come to terms with when I first started<br/>\nletting my kids stay home alone.  So we set some ground rules at first like<br/>\n&quot;no cooking on the stove or in the oven - microwave is fine&quot; and &quot;no going<br/>\noutside when I&#39;m not home.&quot;  Now that they are older those rules have sort<br/>\nof gone away as they can safely cook on the stove and in the oven and going<br/>\noutside isn&#39;t such a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he says &quot;I&#39;m not learning as much as other kids my age are. In<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; school, they do so much more than I am at home. I think I need more<br/>\n&gt; structure and you need to be firmer with me&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because he percieves (thanks to his years of being &quot;in the system&quot;)<br/>\nthat learning is equated to schoolwork, essays, tests, and project<br/>\ndeadlines.  Tell him he is &quot;deschooling&quot; and that learning doesn&#39;t have to<br/>\ncome from a book.  Give him the time to get over learning=schooling.  Tell<br/>\nhim that he doesn&#39;t need to &quot;do&quot; stuff just because the kids at school are.<br/>\nAnd let him see what he has learned without the aide of schoolish things.<br/>\nDid he attend any of the sessions at the convention?<br/>\n<br/>\n but he&#39;s asked me for more<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; structure and rigidity before yet WHENEVER I put hard limits on him,<br/>\n&gt; he goes wild. Why is he asking for what he can&#39;t handle???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He asks these things because HE is confused!  Perhaps he needs a nudge in a<br/>\ndirection of interest?  Maybe he needs to see YOU engaged in your<br/>\nactivities.  Tell him that you are on summer vacation and starting living<br/>\njoyfully!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224193221,"authorName":"Tonya Matthews","from":"&quot;Tonya Matthews&quot; &lt;godzilla.matthews@...&gt;","profile":"auburntonya","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Ok, now what???","postDate":"1149172591","msgId":13859,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU1bXUxZittdmt1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13864,"prevInTime":13858,"nextInTime":13860,"topicId":13859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi All, Here s the run down.. so we go to the Unschooling Conference in Peabody, leave empowered and come back home.
