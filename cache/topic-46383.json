I have trouble formulating thoughtful responses and then beat myself up over my inadequate attempts at small talk. My niece (18) and I were talking about this yesterday. Neither one of us really see the need to talk a lot. Both of us feel misunderstood because we don&#39;t always understand why some people insist on talking so much. If we have something important to say or really care about the other person, then talking is pretty easy. When put on the spot, it is easy to freeze. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Role playing at the park is different than asking specific questions at the library or shooting the breeze with a friend you bump into on the sidewalk.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just to add a little more perspective. Think about the way things operate in schools. If you daughter is 13 and has been in school up until recently, she has never really had the opportunity to shoot the breeze with somebody that she has bumped into on the sidewalk. In schools, when you are in the hall (aka sidewalk), you are not allowed to talk. If you are in the younger grades, students are lined up to go places. While in line, you are expected to be quiet and NOT talk to your neighbor. If you are in the higher grades and are between classes, there isn&#39;t much time to talk otherwise you run the risk of being tardy. Some schools have even gone to silent lunches. Even if lunch isn&#39;t silent, they are really short and do not really leave much opportunity for visiting. In many schools, asking specific questions is often discouraged. Teachers tell you what to study and what to talk about. If you go to the library at school, the teacher is the one that is guiding what you do through things like assigned reading or research. Some schools have accelerated reader programs where they will only let you check out books that are on the level that they have determined you to be on. There is very little choice. Making small talk and shooting the breeze is an acquired skill for some people. It takes lots of practice. It takes having lots of opportunities to sit back and watch other people do it. How can you expect your daughter to have those skills if she has never really been exposed to them outside of school? How can you expect your daughter to get it if she has never had the opportunity to sit back and watch others without the pressure to perform?<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: special needs question...","postDate":"1301025349","msgId":46412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltaDNvNSsxNTduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGltZ2gzdStqN3FrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46411,"nextInTopic":46413,"prevInTime":46411,"nextInTime":46413,"topicId":46383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... learner as you tend toward more spatial intelligence than verbal intelligence ;) ... often recommended about learning in general is Frank Smith s The","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-516597708\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;plaidpanties666&quot;<br/>\n&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If you need a picture in your head, maybe you&#39;re not so much &quot;a slow<br/>\n </span></blockquote>learner&quot; as you tend toward more spatial intelligence than verbal<br/>\nintelligence ;)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.php\">http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.php</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a quick link to the theory of multiple intelligences.

I don&#39;t always like hanging out and communicating with others. I am much more comfortable on these lists because I can think about what is being said and formulate a response. Can she communicate with you without too much trouble? People can communicate without words. I am thinking of how I do things with my kids. They don&#39;t always speak clearly. Instead of focusing on them saying it just right, I might tell them, &quot;I am not sure what you are trying to say, will you please show me?&quot; Then, the focus is completely taken off verbal communication and the situation is diffused. Also, I will ask my kids yes/no questions when I don&#39;t understand what they are trying to tell me.

Or, do you want her to be able to have them to make your life easier? If she likes going to the library with you, then be her advocate and do her talking for her. Does your daughter want to go to the library by herself? If she does, then you can help her find ways around the situation. For example, you can show her/tell her about writing down what she wants on a piece of paper so she can hand it to the librarian. You can also tell her strategies such as taking a book to the librarian and showing it to him/her and saying &quot;More like this please&quot;.

Talking with someone who is interested in her and what she&#39;s saying about what she is reading will naturally lead to more skillfulness in talking about her interests.

Some of those skills overlap, but not all. There may be strategies and tricks your daughter can learn to help, in the way there are strategies and tricks for people who stutter to smooth out their speech, but there&#39;s a catch! Actually, there&#39;s more than one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is that you said she had an &quot;expressive speech delay&quot; - depending on the meaning of the word &quot;delay&quot; it&#39;s possible she&#39;s not developmentally ready to do those things. So just like teaching reading to too-young children, setting her up to learn those tricks will only add to her frustration. She won&#39;t be able to use them in real conversations. But if what she has is a kind of processing delay, then it may be conversations will always be a bit baffling to her. In that case, it would be better to look into the specific strategies used by adults who are poor conversationalists. In either case, its important for you to be Okay with her level of ability and find ways to support her At her level of ability. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the other thing to ask yourself is if your daughter wants to try to learn a bunch of speech skills or if she wants something else. Maybe what she really wants is to feel heard and understood - which is not at all the same as wanting to be a better conversationalist! Maybe she wants to feel smarter or more independent - again, not the same as wanting to learn a specific set of skills. School set you up to think &quot;frustrated in conversation&quot; means &quot;needs to learn xyz&quot;. But &quot;xyz&quot; might not matter to your daughter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI say ask yourself because she might not be able to answer you honestly.

Her writing is much more relaxed and fluid when it&#39;s imaginative.<br/>\nHer last year in school she had a big paper to do, learning how to<br/>\nresearch, outline, edit, etc.  It was terrible - very disorganized,<br/>\nconfusing, simplistic vocab.

I know that<br/>\nputting her on the spot to prove she knows what she&#39;s talking about<br/>\nwould result in her no longer wanting to share a good story with me.  As<br/>\nit is, it&#39;s just a pleasant conversation and I&#39;d like to keep it that<br/>\nway but I do want to help her work on this skill because it is a source<br/>\nof stress for her when she can&#39;t keep up in conversation with others.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want her to keep quiet because she&#39;s not confident in being able<br/>\nto communicate what she&#39;s thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\n**** &gt; Communication depends on listening, so if you&#39;re observing everything<br/>\nshe&#39;s saying as though evaluating her speech, in a sense you aren&#39;t<br/>\nreally listening to or communicating with her. In that sense, you are<br/>\nthe one having trouble communcating ;) But at the same time, speech<br/>\nissues are very very sensitive to the perception of whether or not the<br/>\nother person is listening and cares about what&#39;s being said.

It really isn&#39;t my goal to use reading as a kind of secret<br/>\ntool for speech practice.  However, if there&#39;s a way to help her<br/>\nincrease this skill, I&#39;m interested in hearing about it.  The only thing<br/>\nI can think of is to allow her all the time she wants to read and share<br/>\nwith me what she&#39;s reading.  Right now she&#39;s reading steam punk stories<br/>\nand she&#39;s thrilled with them.  We&#39;ve been pouring through the library<br/>\nand book store.
