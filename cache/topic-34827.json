We<br/>\ndon&#39;t have a toddler group, though.  If we did, I&#39;d imagine that I<br/>\nwould have more obvious difficulties dealing with diverse parenting<br/>\nissues.  With most of our meetings really focused on babies and<br/>\nchildren under a year old, we can really focus on just the &quot;meeting<br/>\nyour baby&#39;s needs&quot; thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that you can expect LLL to really be a parenting group,<br/>\nand certainly not for everyone.  Although there are some basic<br/>\npremises that LLL uses to support breastfeeding (like meeting your<br/>\nchild&#39;s needs), the whole purpose of LLL is to support and educate<br/>\nmoms about breastfeeding.  So you are going to see and meet all sorts<br/>\nof parents and leaders at meetings.  Even Leaders can be very very<br/>\ndiverse.  They will vary greatly from crunchy to mainstream, religious<br/>\nto non-religious, authoritarian to permissive.  When I find myself in<br/>\na meeting surrounded by parents who parent in ways that are the exact<br/>\nopposite of me, I remind myself why I am there - to be around nursing<br/>\nmothers, or to help mothers and babies nurse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, LLL does have alumni groups, for both leaders and members.  But<br/>\nagain, the parenting is going to somewhat diverge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrish<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Faith Void&quot;<br/>\n&lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have had similar experiences but that&#39;s why I became a leader.<br/>\n&gt; Faith<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Mon, Jul 28, 2008 at 5:50 PM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;<br/>\n&gt; polykowholsteins@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;   I have had the same experience here in my LLL and that is why I<br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t go<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; to the meetings anymore.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I just cannot take all the controling.

They may not be doing outright violent things<br/>\nlike spanking, but most of the AP parents I know will use just about<br/>\nany other method to get their kids to do what they want them to do, of<br/>\ncourse veiled in some sort of euphemism (e.g. &quot;help&quot; means &quot;make&quot;, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my theory of why AP parents become a lot less attached as their<br/>\nchild gets older: in one word - school!  As soon as preschool or<br/>\nelementary school surfaces, they begin to detach themselves.  Partly<br/>\nit&#39;s by necessity - they have to force some independence, however<br/>\nunready their child is, to get them ready to be alone with strangers<br/>\nfor many hours per day.  And partly, it&#39;s the unquestioning acceptance<br/>\nthat their child should just magically be more independent by school<br/>\nage.  They sort of think in their minds that their child will just *be<br/>\nready* by age 4 to 5 to be less attached.  The idea of school being<br/>\nrequired in our culture is just so entrenched that most AP parents<br/>\nthat I know never question how it fits with AP parenting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve blogged about this example before - when AP parents face the day<br/>\nwhen their child goes on the school bus and leaves for the first time.<br/>\n Many of them are really upset inside.  If they talk about it a<br/>\nlittle, they will express how they cried and worried, how their child<br/>\nwas upset.   But somehow they are able to push away that awareness<br/>\nthat both parties are doing something unnatural, or that they are not<br/>\nready for.  Some will even say things like, &quot;Well, I know it&#39;s good<br/>\nfor him.&quot; Like they are trying to find the benefit, however hard, in<br/>\nthe situation.  I&#39;m not talking about how I sometimes feel when I see<br/>\nmy son is getting older and becoming more independent on his own terms<br/>\n- I sometimes feel sad, but also happy that he is doing something new,<br/>\ngetting bigger on his own terms.  The parents dealing with the school<br/>\nbus for the first time are almost victims of a system being imposed,<br/>\nwhether they or their child like it or not, and they will use whatever<br/>\npsychological coping strategies and excuses they have to get through<br/>\nit.  If only they could find it within themselves to embrace their<br/>\ninner wisdom and make different choices, or allow their children to<br/>\nmake different choices.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTrish<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kim Zerbe&quot; &lt;kim.zerbe@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yikes on the woman who wants to get rid of her TV because her son<br/>\n </span></blockquote>watches<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it!!!

So then why can&#39;t I find anyone in my AP group who is on this<br/>\npath??? There is 1 (the AP leader actually) who is also on the UP board and<br/>\nseems to be reading all the same books as me. ;) I&#39;m not sure she will be<br/>\nunschooling, but maybe we should talk. The only friend I have who is on the<br/>\nunschooling path quit the AP group a long time ago. She is an LLL leader and<br/>\nstuck more with that group. I have a feeling her and I could start our own<br/>\nunschooling group pretty soon! (We live on the west side of town and most of<br/>\nthe unschooling stuff in town happens downtown or on the north or east<br/>\nsides, nowhere near us.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder about some women who are so into breastfeeding (something I<br/>\nsee as a way to connect with my child) and then as soon as the kid is<br/>\nweaned, there is no connection (or they just don&#39;t put much time into their<br/>\nrelationship with their child after that, just an observation with a few<br/>\nmoms I know). They send them off to day care so they can go back to work. Or<br/>\nlike you said, they seem to try to control every aspect of the child&#39;s life.<br/>\nNot all breastfed kids are attached! My own sister has 4 kids who were BF<br/>\n(14mos up to 2 yrs, generally weaned when she was pregnant with the next<br/>\none) and they slept in bed next to her during that time, but now she sort of<br/>\nignores them and there are just 4 kids running around the house and they are<br/>\nsome of the wildest and most violent kids I know. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am thinking about this a lot. How to stay attached with my son as<br/>\nhe grows older. Also realizing our need to connect with other families who<br/>\nare on a similar path. I need in person support. Most of my friends are<br/>\npretty mainstream and as much as I love them (and would love to influence<br/>\nthem to be more like me, haha!) it can be straining to hang out with them<br/>\nand see how they treat their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim Z<br/>\nwww.passitonsales. com<br/>\n<br/>\nThis email was sent on 100% recycled electrons.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geo.yahoo\">http://geo.yahoo</a> com/serv? s=97359714/ grpId=12789513/ grpspId=17050819 72/msgI<br/>\nd=34859/stime= 1217265225/ nc1=4025291/ nc2=5286667/ nc3=5191954&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: needing time for myself","postDate":"1217281825","msgId":34864,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMjUzLjY2ODMwLnFtQHdlYjgxNTAzLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34863,"nextInTopic":34865,"prevInTime":34863,"nextInTime":34865,"topicId":34827,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have had the same experience here in my LLL and that is why I don t go to the meetings anymore.

I have a homeschooling friend who got rid of her TV earlier this year.<br/>\nApparently she was addicted to Lost or something like that and the only way<br/>\nshe could control her urge to watch was to get rid of her TV! (What the ???)<br/>\nShe was also of the opinion that it would be better for her son. Wow. If I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want to watch the TV, I turn mine off.<br/>\n <br/>\nOn the AP note, I&#39;m in limbo because I can&#39;t quite find a local group I fit<br/>\nwith. We have an AP group that is pretty good sized and I try to make the<br/>\nmeetings (once a month) but it doesn&#39;t always work out. The leader is great<br/>\nat getting discussions going online, but I had hoped to meet and make more<br/>\nfriends in person. I&#39;ve been in the group for almost 3 years and the friends<br/>\nI used to have don&#39;t go anymore and/or live too far from us. I&#39;m discouraged<br/>\nbecause at the last meeting I&#39;m sure I had the oldest child there and he was<br/>\nonly 3.5 then! Where are the parents with older kids?! Now he is 4 and I&#39;m<br/>\nfeeling less and less connected with the AP group because the meeting is so<br/>\nfull of babies. Is AP only for babies? What comes next?! Sure it&#39;s nice to<br/>\nbe there to support them, something I enjoy, but I had also hoped to find<br/>\nfriends who are on a similar life path with kids the same age as mine. Is<br/>\nthat too much to ask?? I guess we just need to plug into the unschooling<br/>\ncommunity now. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere is something else about the AP moms I couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on<br/>\nbut I think you just did. The older children are all in preschools now and<br/>\nit&#39;s harder to meet up with them or even meet new people because moms with<br/>\npreschool aged kids just don&#39;t go to the meetings anymore. It&#39;s almost like<br/>\nthey lost the attachment part of parenting. I know working moms can be<br/>\nattached (it&#39;s harder!), I just wonder how the SAHMs justify sending a 2 yr<br/>\nold off to school when the mom doesn&#39;t work. I guess it is the &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\nthing to do. Fit into society.<br/>\n <br/>\nI thought there was a natural migration from Attachment Parenting to<br/>\nUnconditional Parenting to Unschooling! It all seems to follow the needs of<br/>\nthe child.
