My ds (4.5) was so easy going until he turned 3, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s when we started with the traditional parenting tactics, which he totally resisted.  <br/>\nSince embracing radical unschooling approx. 8 mos. ago our house is so much more <br/>\npeaceful.  My dh and I were just talking about letting go with our ds last night and how <br/>\nmuch ds is learning by making his own decisions.  For about 6 months ds wore all of his <br/>\nclothes backwards (including underwear), and occasionally I would slip up (worried about <br/>\nwhat someone might say) and tell him &quot;you need to turn your shorts around, because <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to the store, ect...&quot;, and he resisted and resisted, and finally I just let it go.  As <br/>\nfar as sleeping and eating are concerned, we want him to listen to his body and no one <br/>\nelse (including us), and we have had conversations with him about listening to his body.  <br/>\nSometimes he falls asleep at 8:00, and sometimes not until 11:00, but consistently sleeps <br/>\napprox. 10 hours either way.  Also the whole bath/shower thing, before embracing <br/>\nunschooling we were having major power struggles with him to take a bath if it had been a <br/>\nweek since he had one.  For awhile I think he was testing us, going 2 weeks or more in <br/>\nbetween bathing, relishing his new found freedom, and now he consistently takes a bath <br/>\ntwice a week, and he requests it, not us. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is just much more peace on so many levels with unschooling, it&#39;s just re-training <br/>\nourselves as parents I think to go against society and listen to our children, because they <br/>\nknow what&#39;s best for themselves, not us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kellmar98&quot; &lt;kellmar98@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First off my girls refused to take showers last night.

My oldest got in the shower this morning without me <br/>\n&gt; asking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest came down stairs dressed for Church, and she looked <br/>\n&gt; absolutely ridiculous.  I told her, her pants were way too short.  <br/>\n&gt; She said she wanted to wear them.  Now there was a time that I <br/>\n&gt; completely controlled what my kids wore.  My daughter is 8, and ever <br/>\n&gt; since she was about 7 she has her own ideas about what she wants to <br/>\n&gt; wear.  So I let it go.  In the scheme of things who cares if she <br/>\n&gt; goes off to Church in pants that are too short. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now my youngest said to me that her tummy hurt, and she&#39;s not going <br/>\n&gt; to Church.  So I stayed home with her, and sent hubby, oldest <br/>\n&gt; daughter, and my Mother on their way to Church.  My husband told my <br/>\n&gt; youngest that she is not going outside to play later if she is not <br/>\n&gt; going to Church.  I pulled him aside and said &quot;why not?&quot;  Really <br/>\n&gt; what is the big deal?  She&#39;s not running a fever.  She probably just <br/>\n&gt; does not want to go to Church, and I don&#39;t believe in forcing my <br/>\n&gt; children to go to Church.  So I convinced hubby to let that one go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My Mother is staying with us, because I had knee surgery.  She flew <br/>\n&gt; out to take care of the kids while I recovered.  I&#39;m fine at this <br/>\n&gt; point.  But anyway I know all this stuff is driving her crazy <br/>\n&gt; because she is very traditional in her thinking.  It&#39;s driving her <br/>\n&gt; nuts that I don&#39;t make my kids go to bed.  Well my girls go to bed <br/>\n&gt; every night on their own by 10 p.m.  I don&#39;t see what the big deal <br/>\n&gt; is.  My youngest is really good about listening to her body and <br/>\n&gt; getting enough sleep.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So slowly I am learning to let go.  My 6 year old has Aspergers, and <br/>\n&gt; Sensory Processing Disorder.  Part of Aspergers (atleast for my <br/>\n&gt; daughter) is having a hard time changing from one thing to another <br/>\n&gt; and having severe temper tantrums.  So life is hard enough having a <br/>\n&gt; special needs child in the house.  She can dig her heals in like <br/>\n&gt; nobody I have ever come across in my lifetime.  Getting into a power <br/>\n&gt; struggle with her is just useless, and makes the whole house <br/>\n&gt; miserable.

Lately, he has been wearing them with one leg on and one leg <br/>\noff (ahem, the mother of necessity, if you know what I mean). But, <br/>\nhe *really* likes wearing them that way! In fact, it&#39;s cool with him <br/>\nto wear one white sock and one black sock (another happy fashion <br/>\naccident arrived at by the lack of an extant matching pair). Having <br/>\nsaid that, he would not be caught dead out in public wearing sweat <br/>\npants. Don&#39;t ask me why &#39;cause I don&#39;t know, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter. He feels good with his own, unique look, and that&#39;s fine <br/>\nwith me! (Truth is, it caught me up short the first time we were <br/>\nready to go and his pants were like that, but I could see he felt so <br/>\ngood about them that way, that I stuffed whatever <br/>\n&#39;whatever-will-they-think-of-me&#39; thoughts I was beginning to cook up, <br/>\nand off we went.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know this, though: Every time we choose a path of peace, life <br/>\ncan get exponentially better. So, when we choose to let go of <br/>\ncontrolling things like what our kids wear or what time they go to <br/>\nbed, we embrace a more peaceful, loving life with our <br/>\nkids. Conversely, choosing power struggles about these things can <br/>\ndrive a wedge between us and our kids and make a peaceful, loving <br/>\nlife just that much more remote. This has been my experience, <br/>\nanyway, and I wouldn&#39;t trade one moment of walking joyfully down the <br/>\nstreet with my son feeling good about his one-leg-on-one-leg-off look <br/>\nfor ANYthing!

Lately, he has been wearing them with one leg on and one leg <br/>\noff (ahem, the mother of necessity, if you know what I mean).  But, <br/>\nhe *really* likes wearing them that way!  In fact, it&#39;s cool with him <br/>\nto wear one white sock and one black sock (another happy fashion <br/>\naccident arrived at by the lack of an extant matching pair).  Having <br/>\nsaid that, he would not be caught dead out in public wearing sweat <br/>\npants.  Don&#39;t ask me why &#39;cause I don&#39;t know, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmatter.  He feels good with his own, unique look, and that&#39;s fine <br/>\nwith me!  (Truth is, it caught me up short the first time we were <br/>\nready to go and his pants were like that, but I could see he felt so <br/>\ngood about them that way, that I stuffed whatever <br/>\n&#39;whatever-will-they-think-of-me&#39; thoughts I was beginning to cook up, <br/>\nand off we went.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know this, though:  Every time we choose a path of peace, life <br/>\ncan get exponentially better.  So, when we choose to let go of <br/>\ncontrolling things like what our kids wear or what time they go to <br/>\nbed, we embrace a more peaceful, loving life with our <br/>\nkids.  Conversely, choosing power struggles about these things can <br/>\ndrive a wedge between us and our kids and make a peaceful, loving <br/>\nlife just that much more remote.  This has been my experience, <br/>\nanyway, and I wouldn&#39;t trade one moment of walking joyfully down the <br/>\nstreet with my son feeling good about his one-leg-on-one-leg-off look <br/>\nfor ANYthing!

My oldest came","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-514670586\">First off my girls refused to take showers last night.  So I let it <br/>\ngo....no biggy.  My oldest got in the shower this morning without me <br/>\nasking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest came down stairs dressed for Church, and she looked <br/>\nabsolutely ridiculous.  I told her, her pants were way too short.  <br/>\nShe said she wanted to wear them.  Now there was a time that I <br/>\ncompletely controlled what my kids wore.  My daughter is 8, and ever <br/>\nsince she was about 7 she has her own ideas about what she wants to <br/>\nwear.  So I let it go.  In the scheme of things who cares if she <br/>\ngoes off to Church in pants that are too short. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow my youngest said to me that her tummy hurt, and she&#39;s not going <br/>\nto Church.  So I stayed home with her, and sent hubby, oldest <br/>\ndaughter, and my Mother on their way to Church.  My husband told my <br/>\nyoungest that she is not going outside to play later if she is not <br/>\ngoing to Church.  I pulled him aside and said &quot;why not?&quot;  Really <br/>\nwhat is the big deal?  She&#39;s not running a fever.  She probably just <br/>\ndoes not want to go to Church, and I don&#39;t believe in forcing my <br/>\nchildren to go to Church.  So I convinced hubby to let that one go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mother is staying with us, because I had knee surgery.  She flew <br/>\nout to take care of the kids while I recovered.  I&#39;m fine at this <br/>\npoint.  But anyway I know all this stuff is driving her crazy <br/>\nbecause she is very traditional in her thinking.  It&#39;s driving her <br/>\nnuts that I don&#39;t make my kids go to bed.  Well my girls go to bed <br/>\nevery night on their own by 10 p.m.  I don&#39;t see what the big deal <br/>\nis.  My youngest is really good about listening to her body and <br/>\ngetting enough sleep.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo slowly I am learning to let go.  My 6 year old has Aspergers, and <br/>\nSensory Processing Disorder.  Part of Aspergers (atleast for my <br/>\ndaughter) is having a hard time changing from one thing to another <br/>\nand having severe temper tantrums.  So life is hard enough having a <br/>\nspecial needs child in the house.  She can dig her heals in like <br/>\nnobody I have ever come across in my lifetime.  Getting into a power <br/>\nstruggle with her is just useless, and makes the whole house <br/>\nmiserable.  So letting go of things that don&#39;t really matter is a <br/>\ngood thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18764,"nextTopicId":18770}}
