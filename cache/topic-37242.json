We have some extras that bring us joy, Netflix, WoW, cell<br/>\nphones, etc. We save for Unschooling trips because they are so important to<br/>\nus (Malila paid for half of Live and Learn because it was THAT important to<br/>\nher and we were really short on money). We all have a vision board and we<br/>\nhave a family vision board. We buy what we can or obtain it from other<br/>\nresources (free clothing store, freecycle, thrift store, etc) We are really<br/>\ncreative :-) When we have money the kids get any lessons they want and<br/>\nmemberships to the places we love to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that we are lacking this year is lessons (they want martial<br/>\narts and gymnastics) because we are that tight right now. But they know that<br/>\nif/when we do have it it will be paid for by us.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe get most of our clothing free but some at the thrift store or yard sales.<br/>\nWe get a lot of toys/games/books at yard sales/freecycle/paperback swap etc.<br/>\nWe put it out to the universe and it usually comes. being poor doesn&#39;t have<br/>\nto feel like poverty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go to as many Unschooling gatherings as possible. I find that just saying<br/>\nwe are going makes it happen :-) When I say i can&#39;t afford something it just<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come. I am just not open. SO I say we are going and we find a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider all these things to be basics.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids get their allowance and occasional money from relatives. It is<br/>\ntheirs to spend. Anyway they want. It isn&#39;t to get things I won&#39;t buy them.<br/>\nIt is to get them things I can&#39;t buy them. Or save.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I pay for clothes, food, lessons and/or equipment, trips, and subcriptions<br/>\n&gt; (netflix, WoW, gamefly).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where we differ somewhat. We pay for basics, and the kids can<br/>\nbuy above and beyond that if they want.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah---but what I listed above I DO consider &quot;the basics.&quot; Clothes, food,<br/>\nlessons, equipment, trips, subscriptions---all those are basics here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37162,"nextTopicId":37149}}
