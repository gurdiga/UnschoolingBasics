They are <br/>\nallowed to be homeschooled only if they succeed at these annual tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis part worried me, as I wanted my kids to be free to learn at their <br/>\nown pace and following their own lead, so I did what somebody here <br/>\nsuggested me once, on another subject : I looked for more information <br/>\n(information is often a good cure for fears, that&#39;s what I had been <br/>\ntold, by Joyce if I remember well). I called the person in charge of <br/>\nthese tests and have been quite reassured : if my kid fail once, he <br/>\nwon&#39;t be sent back to school between two policemen. It also depends on <br/>\nhow far &quot;behind&quot; from the standards he is ... These tests are meant to <br/>\nprotect the children and the state will try to find a solution with the <br/>\nparents rather than against them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe feeling I got from discussing with this person was that they were <br/>\nquite open. But I don&#39;t know any true radical unschoolers here, so I <br/>\nguess she hasn&#39;t met many either :) It&#39;s difficult in these conditions <br/>\nto anticipate what her reaction could be ... That&#39;s why I would like <br/>\nto &quot;train&quot; Sylvain to do the kind of exercise they&#39;ll propose, but this <br/>\nonly if I can do it &quot;lightly&quot; - and that was the sense of my question <br/>\nin another message.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282257979,"authorName":"Wildflower Car","from":"&quot;Wildflower Car&quot; &lt;unschoolfool@...&gt;","profile":"red_olive5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"required testing/curious","postDate":"1189905552","msgId":26257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwNS1GMzRBMjZGRTQxMUIzRUJCQ0ZGMDIzQkNBQkUwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26258,"prevInTime":26256,"nextInTime":26258,"topicId":26257,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"For those of you who have to do testing to unschool, I have a question.
