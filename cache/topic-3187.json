I can imagine this <br/>\nwas a huge shock for you and it makes my heart ache for you!  <br/>\n<br/>\nLets focus first on the &quot;more children&quot; issue.  You have 3 amazing <br/>\nchildren.  That is an awesome thing and something that you need to <br/>\nfind comfort in.  IF you are meant to have more children...you will.  <br/>\nIF you are meant to have 3 children...you will.  Try to be grateful <br/>\nfor the children you do have and release any worry and grief you have <br/>\nabout not having more children.  That is something that may change <br/>\nand isn&#39;t something you can change by being worried or angry about <br/>\nit.  So, this one issue isn&#39;t something you need to focus on right <br/>\nnow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI so agree that your best bet to keeping the kids at home is going to <br/>\nbe releasing the anger you&#39;re feeling and focusing on loving your <br/>\nhubby right where he is at.  Thankfully you probably have another <br/>\nmonth to work on him in the &quot;sending kids to school&quot; department, so <br/>\ntry to keep calm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely clean your house.  I know that can be overwhelming, <br/>\nespecially when you feel like you&#39;re the only one contributing to it, <br/>\nbut you can do it!  Start with the kitchen, the area your husband <br/>\nfirst enters the house at, and the master bedroom.  Your kitchen can <br/>\nprobably be truly cleaned and organized in a weekend...this weekend!  <br/>\nYou could devote 15 minutes every morning, afternoon, and evening to <br/>\ncleaning the next room you&#39;re working on.  See if your kids are <br/>\nwilling to help you.  Turn on some positive and fun (energetic) music <br/>\nand get to cleaning as often and as long as your schedule allows.  <br/>\nCome up with a list of things you&#39;re going to do daily (dishes, <br/>\nunloading the dishwasher, 2 loads of laundry from start to finish, <br/>\ncleaning the kitchen counters/stove, having kids put their things <br/>\nback in their rooms at the end of the day, etc) and do them EVERY day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave dinner going by the time he gets home from work every day.  It <br/>\nsounds like that would make your hubby really feel appreciated...and <br/>\nit&#39;s something you&#39;re probably doing every day anyway (just not at <br/>\nthe time he would like)!  Doing these things will show him that you <br/>\ntruly desire to meet his needs and make him happy.  When he sees you <br/>\nputting effort towards meeting his needs he will be more likely to <br/>\nput effort towards meeting your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you...I know this isn&#39;t an easy thing for you to do, but <br/>\nyou CAN do it!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285800846,"authorName":"squishymommyof2","from":"squishymommyof2 &lt;SquishyMommyof2@...&gt;","profile":"steveshotwife2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help","postDate":"1227983256","msgId":37115,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczMTQ3ODNhLjJmOGQuNDRkZS45M2NmLmRlZGRjZTA4NTc3ZkBhb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0MzA5OC4zOTQ2Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDE0MzA5OC4zOTQ2Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":37114,"nextInTopic":37116,"prevInTime":37114,"nextInTime":37116,"topicId":3187,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have always been just naturally messy people, this is all out of the blue.

First of all I married into a very strong Catholic family. That is not the problem. The problem is they are very opinionated.They believe that is the Catholic is the only way. Any other religion is wrong.OK my parents were hippies which I was brought up as I can make my own decision about religion and life. My husband family wife stays home because man is the boss.My family my mom worked.  I only stay home because my husband is the one with the good job. I do like staying home with the kids. My husband is the not like his family. We are a team. I just don&#39;t want my daughter to follow his family ways. Unless she wants to. I want her to make her own decision in life as a strong independent women. I am not<br/>\n slamming Catholics. I am slamming his family.

So, I&#39;d take him out of K and not give it another <br/>\nthought.  Boy, I wish VA&#39;s laws were that simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand how you feel about K being all day.  In my city, K is all <br/>\nday long too, but they do give the kids a nap.

He will also do it in his *own way*. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that some Unschooling kids like worksheets. However my<br/>\nrecollection of the many informal anecdotes shared by people over time on<br/>\nline is that these kids are probably the minority. See<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/math for some great stories. Somewhere on her site there<br/>\nused to be a story of her daughter, Holly, using a math worksheet in an<br/>\nunconventional and surprising way that nonetheless showed she understood the<br/>\nconcepts. Your son may never find worksheets helpful or use them in the<br/>\nstandard schoolish drill way. We keep the odd workbook that has been sent by<br/>\nNan in the pile with our coloring books. OTOH if allowed to discover them<br/>\nfor himself, he may find them a terrific resource for his personal<br/>\nexplorations and understanding. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, if you can, stop separating math (or any other &quot;subject&quot;) from life<br/>\nby making it a schoolish activity. If your son is doing things with lego,<br/>\nthen he is already engaging in &quot;pre-math&quot; skills building activites like<br/>\nsorting, planning and engineering. He is already noticing and using relative<br/>\nsizes and lengths. He is seeing spatial relationships. And that is outside<br/>\nof using the digital camera and the storytelling part.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is this cultural myth thingie that &quot;homeschoolers make cookies to<br/>\nteach math&quot;. I don&#39;t know what other people do. But here in my house, as<br/>\nUnschoolers, we make cookies to make cookies, and if necessary we use math<br/>\nto help us make more cookies. Doing activities in order to learn specific<br/>\nschoolish stuff is backwards prioritizing. We learn or practice skills in<br/>\norder to facilitate the fun activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about Unschooling is that it frees us from having to<br/>\ncompare our children to any other children, any other group of children, or<br/>\nany arbitrary scale or bell curve of either mediocrity *or* excellence. We<br/>\nare freed to be filled with joyful wonderment at the sparkling individuality<br/>\nand personal uniqueness of our children, as they find extraordinary and<br/>\ndelightful ways of discovering knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

And I don&#39;t want to feel that way. I shouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nacting in certain ways in order to avoid her melt downs. I can see acting<br/>\nways to evade them or to prevent them but sheesh we were out today and I saw<br/>\nher face changing and I almost cried at the thought of it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hey being demanded to build a swing set at midnight is not that<br/>\nweird...Hannah just hasn&#39;t thought of it yet:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is part of it, it all has to be RIGHT NOW! No matter what, no<br/>\nthought for anyone else. And no matter how many &quot;right now&#39;s&quot; you responded<br/>\ntoo immediately, there is another and another and another. To the point of<br/>\nexhaustion.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I was very un-unschooly and just said no and told her why and that I<br/>\nexpected her to help... AND SHE DID! Couldn&#39;t believe it, but it worked and<br/>\nshe did not put up a stink. I think sometimes, she gets more demanding if I<br/>\nseem to be waffling, like she smells my hesitation and goes for the<br/>\njugular:) So sounding emphatic might be the order of the day these days for<br/>\nher. We will see.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the list and good luck on your trip to unschooling. I have not<br/>\nhad a problem with letting go of school like that since we have never done<br/>\nanything like that with Hannah, my challenges come in the other side of it,<br/>\nletting go of control of TV and food for example. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for schooling, after all this time complaining about Hannah I have to say<br/>\nthis. She has decided to spell and has been feverish about learning her<br/>\nletters and spelling things, and is constantly asking how to spell words,<br/>\nwhich is really thrilling to see. She is also VERY into counting, we count<br/>\neverything. She asks how many apples we want to buy and then wants to count<br/>\nthem out. She totally blew me away the other day by counting to 100 in the<br/>\nvan with only the reminder of 50 or 60 or 70 and then she flew with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is my brag too, helps me to remember she isn&#39;t just a tyrant right<br/>\nnow:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Grame Family [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:poochieville@...\">poochieville@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, September 16, 2004 7:42 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Re:Help<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lurking for a few months.
