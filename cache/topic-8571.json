I am with you!  I think I would prefer to be part of a group that challenges me to think beyond my own limitations rather than be validated in doing something that may or may not be what is in the best interests for my family.  One thing about this group is that I am always thinking about various posts and trying to see if what those who trust the process fully is really true.  I feel that as a result of people challenging what I have posted as well as others I am a better mother and person in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamedalah, I don&#39;t know what your experience has been with children at home but I want to say that I have at times felt at a lost, as a matter of fact still do some days, as to what we are to do.  Staying at home is the paradigm within which I was raised.  Neither is hsing and definitely not unschooling so I am just clueless some days.  But, like you have described, it feels so right and we will take it one moment at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care and thanks for sharing as you have stated what I had not yet been able to articulate with respect to the recent thread that took place.<br/>\n<br/>\nmuch love to ALL<br/>\nTyra Olufemi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: queenpamedalah <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Wednesday, December 28, 2005 10:59 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] WOW!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve just been reading over the past few days&#39; posts.

I pulled my boys out of pre-school (my <br/>\noldest was in Jr Kindergarten and my youngest in a 2 yr old room) <br/>\nbefore Christmas and we are trying to find our rhythm.  Christmas <br/>\nday was lovely with lots of playing, video games and painting.  We <br/>\nget to snuggle in bed again in the morning (like we only used to be <br/>\nable to do on the weekends!), sometimes with the Doodlebops, but <br/>\nusually just with some playful wrestling and giggling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the library and got library cards (yes, I had never <br/>\nactually been to our local library!) and my oldest (5 yrs) was <br/>\namazed and picked up a book off the shelf and started reading it to <br/>\nhis little brother (just turned 3).  They both just &quot;fit&quot; so well <br/>\nthere.  They were very comfortable and it was a very nice time.  I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking we&#39;ll go there once a week (so we can return the other <br/>\nbooks and get new ones, etc.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday we went to the park (it was a balmy 60 - and this is why I <br/>\ndon&#39;t live in Maine! LOL) and tromped through the leaves and climbed <br/>\nand talked about the sky.  I know I didn&#39;t actively teach anything.  <br/>\nI just answered their questions.  But I&#39;m guessing what we did <br/>\nachieve is learning that this is how it&#39;s going to be... time with <br/>\nmom, time to ask questions and time for me to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for those of you for whom that was too subtle, I choose not to <br/>\nthrow two more cents into the fray.  I have already gained a bit of <br/>\ninsight from this group.  I joined for that reason.  If I find that <br/>\nI&#39;m not getting anything, I&#39;ll unsub.  So, dear moderators, keep up <br/>\nthe good work.  I appreciate your efforts and hope to be a great <br/>\nunschooling mom!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope everyone has a prosperous New Year (by prosperous, I don&#39;t <br/>\nrefer to things financial, but things like time, joy and moments to <br/>\ncherish that which is important to you).<br/>\n<br/>\nPamedalah :)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40222,"nextTopicId":40244}}
