They would quiz her even long distance in emails while they were out of state for the winter, put her on the spot. Pressure her until she came home crying most times. I even spoke to the mother and she would not let up. Hannah had to make the decision to stop being friends. Broke her heart and mine to see her in so much pain:( The emails were relentless in the end. Telling her things like they don&#39;t want to see her flipping burgers for the rest of her life and that she needed to catch up on her schooling so she could get a job! I haven&#39;t told my dad that we unschool and I don&#39;t even want to go there. I was just thinking of when she turns 18, in 3 yrs., he&#39;s gonna ask about her diploma. UGH! Oh well. Guess I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. What&#39;s the worse that could happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe joined this group and another unschooling group on fb so Hannah could meet like-minded friends. She is now at the point where she knows what kind of friend she wants and is focusing on manifesting that;) She&#39;s such a strong and independant young woman, making the choice to end her relationship with her friend. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to do that if she had experienced the onslaught of constant peer pressure to fit in in public institutions. I love my daughter dearly and love to watch her blossom into this stable-minded individual;)<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Loretta&quot; &lt;tinamariesmom@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling so bummed today.

This is coming up in several areas for us too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own mother quizzes the kids on spelling and math.  As a 2nd year unschooler, my kids get questioned by my chiropractor about what they are learning whenever we go in for appts. Then she interrogates me - &quot;Isn&#39;t she learning about the missions this year?  She IS in fourth grade and YOU KNOW that is a state standard.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m waiting to finally be more comfortable with these aggressive types and telling them to mind their own business. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny one have empowering comebacks that aren&#39;t &#39;suspicion&#39; arousing?

But just last night, my 10 yo, who we have always considered the <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;lazy&quot; one, saw me picking up the living room and said, &quot;I&#39;ll do that, mom&quot; and <br/>\n<br/>\ndid it.

They would quiz her even long distance in emails while they were out of state for the winter, put her on the spot. Pressure her until she came home crying most times. I even spoke to the mother and she would not let up. Hannah had to make the decision to stop being friends. Broke her heart and mine to see her in so much pain:( The emails were relentless in the end. Telling her things like they don&#39;t want to see her flipping burgers for the rest of her life and that she needed to catch up on her schooling so she could get a job! I haven&#39;t told my dad that we unschool and I don&#39;t even want to go there. I was just thinking of when she turns 18, in 3 yrs., he&#39;s gonna ask about her diploma. UGH! Oh well. Guess I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. What&#39;s the worse that could happen?<br/>\nWe joined this group and another unschooling group on fb so Hannah could meet like-minded friends. She is now at the point where she knows what kind of friend she wants and is focusing on manifesting that;) She&#39;s such a strong and independant young woman, making the choice to end her relationship with her friend. I don&#39;t think she would have been able to do that if she had experienced the onslaught of constant peer pressure to fit in in public institutions. I love my daughter dearly and love to watch her blossom into this stable-minded individual;)<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Loretta&quot; &lt;tinamariesmom@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling so bummed today.

This is coming up in several areas for us too.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own mother quizzes the kids on spelling and math.  As a 2nd year unschooler, my kids get questioned by my chiropractor about what they are learning whenever we go in for appts. Then she interrogates me - &quot;Isn&#39;t she learning about the missions this year?  She IS in fourth grade and YOU KNOW that is a state standard.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m waiting to finally be more comfortable with these aggressive types and telling them to mind their own business. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny one have empowering comebacks that aren&#39;t &#39;suspicion&#39; arousing?  Something to tell them to back off?  Our preference is to not be defensive.  After all there is nothing to defend!

I feel like I have been <br/>\nas stressed and oppressed as my kids...and I am currently &quot;deschooling&quot; along <br/>\nwith them...acting as if I am on summer break! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am wondering how to find balance in my days...between childcare, <br/>\nunschooling, home care, and a part-time job...???<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you pursue your passions and interests while still meeting <br/>\nresponsibilities?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Maybe I shouldn&#39;t be worrying about this yet?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note - I have noticed that since I am not requiring my kids to do jobs <br/>\nand chores around the house, that they are more willing to help out.  It seems <br/>\nso opposite!  But just last night, my 10 yo, who we have always considered the <br/>\n&quot;lazy&quot; one, saw me picking up the living room and said, &quot;I&#39;ll do that, mom&quot; and <br/>\ndid it.  I about fell over!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I really can get the hang of this...I think unschooling will be good for <br/>\nall of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nBack to top   Reply to sender  | Reply to group  | Reply via web post  <br/>\nMessages in this topic  (1)      <br/>\n <br/>\nRecent Activity <br/>\n\t*  17  <br/>\nNew Members   Visit Your Group   <br/>\nY!
