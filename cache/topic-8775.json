I really believe that unschooling is the best kept secret for helping kids that need to heal, well it&#39;s great for all kids, but for the ones who have survived the foster care system and have gone through all the horror to even get there, unschooling can very well be the only way to save their emotional lives.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have had my beautiful 12 year old daughter for 5 years now.

She is one of the main reasons I no longer have any dissenters in my family regarding home schooling (I don&#39;t use the term unschooling with relatives, way more explaining than I&#39;m interested in doing).

I <br/>\ntook her out of school first, before the other two and unschooled <br/>\nher from the start. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne at a time, over the last year, we have dropped ALL therapy. This <br/>\nwas such a major step for her and we had many discussions about it  <br/>\nbecause therapy was sort of a safey net for her. Just having to not <br/>\nstop what were doing to go to therapy is a big deal.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the biggest news here is that she&#39;s been off Adderall for a <br/>\nmonth now. :-) I was a bit nervous at first because I don&#39;t know her <br/>\noff meds.

I didn&#39;t know her before she went <br/>\non them and I didn&#39;t know what to expect but she&#39;s doing so great!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even tell you how much respect I have for her.
