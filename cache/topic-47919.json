I had a conversation with them about what kids do.  The kids just looking for community service hours re-shelve books.  Kids who have a greater interest or commitment - not just fulfilling a requirement-  start out learning the stacks then get put on &quot;special projects&quot; described as fun and varied.  I live in New york and see that the public library system is pretty behind the rest of the world in technology- have it and use it but seems like so much more could be developed if the money and talent were there.  Not sure where you are, the status of your public library system,  or if this would be of interest, but perhaps worth an inquiry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just skimmed the teen lib handbook- there is a list of ideas that might get you on a good track.  For us its been about seeing what is in the community and local enough to get to regularly.  We have groups doing Midnight Run (feeding the homeless and giving them coats in NYC).  We have Agfa, church groups that do some good stuff, all sorts of Hudson River environmental groups including Pete Seeger and his work with Clearwater, when you start looking one thing gets you connected to another or to another person who knows all kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 14, 2012, at 10:17 PM, danajeh wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; This kind of thing I don&#39;t have much experience with, it being outside my comfort zone (shy!).

And basically the only model they know of is school. So the free form exploration they&#39;re doing can feel it comes up short.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a period of transitions between interests. So it can be a more difficult time for her to explore interests. And school can look like it has some magical process of getting that vague feeling of needing focus but can&#39;t quite put her finger on.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis describes my 12 1/2 yr old son very well and I am wondering if people have practical advice for me.  Over the years he has participated in all sorts of outside activities including classes, clubs, homeschool group, travel, etc as well as having tons of at-home time for lego, reading, gaming, etc.  He is restless and wants *more* and we are in a bumpy, uncomfortable period where we are headed somewhere new but don&#39;t know where or how.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has said that he plans on going to high school (which would be in a year and a half) and wants to spend this time making sure he knows everything that school-kids have been learning. I&#39;ve been finding resources for him and sitting with him when he is in the mood to work on stuff. I&#39;m fine with supporting him in this way, but I am wondering what else is out there for young teens besides school.  I would like for him to have lots of options so that if he chooses school it is because that is the best option for him rather than choosing school because he/I don&#39;t know what other possibilities there are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the things he has expressed:  he wants to widen his social circle; he wants structured activities (an adult who knows what they&#39;re doing setting out a plan for him and guiding him through it); he likes the group momentum and camaraderie of a classroom; he wants to feel confident that he can do whatever he wants (go to college, apply for jobs).  I sense that he is craving some challenge and depth and also that he wants to be swimming with all the other fish and not feel so out-of-the-mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny been-there-done-that?  Advice?  Inspiration? Resources? I&#39;d love to hear about other people&#39;s experiences.<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you,<br/>\nJen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47915,"nextTopicId":47920}}
