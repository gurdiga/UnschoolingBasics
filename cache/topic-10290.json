It&#39;s is not as hard as people say.  <br/>\nPeople keep saying it&#39;s hard, then they thing it&#39;s hard, and then  <br/>\nit&#39;s hard :D<br/>\n<br/>\nI studied Japanese with a great teacher at university. First of all,  <br/>\nyou need to know that Japanese has three different writing systems  <br/>\nand they are all needed! Kanji are the signs which were taken from  <br/>\nChinese language hundreds or thousands of years ago (I don&#39;t remember  <br/>\nhow many ;-) ). So they took these signs for some words, but because  <br/>\nthe grammar is different, they needed to add other signs which would  <br/>\nindicate the grammatical meanings (past, present, possession and so  <br/>\nmany other things). Some monks invented Katakana, which is a sylable  <br/>\nsystem. It&#39;s like an ABC, but there is a sign for each sylable, so  <br/>\nma, me, mi, mo, mu have all different signs, and la le li lo lu have  <br/>\nall different signs and so on, all the possible combinations have  <br/>\ndifferent sounds ‚Äì in Japanese a sylable is always one consonant and  <br/>\none vowel. But then! They thought women were too dumb to learn that  <br/>\nand they weren&#39;t allowed, but because women wanted to read and write  <br/>\nlove stories, they invented one of their own, called Hiragana. This  <br/>\nis also a system of sylables.<br/>\n<br/>\nNowadays Katakana is used for all the words which come from abroad,  <br/>\nlike coca-cola, computer, mac donalds (and because the sylables have  <br/>\nto be consonant+vowel, and because they have not &quot;l&quot;, they would  <br/>\nspell out with sylabic symbols &quot;ma-ku-do-na-ru-do&quot; for mac-donalds :D  <br/>\nor &quot;bo-yu-fu-re-n-do&quot; for boyfriend (&quot;n&quot; being the only one-consonant  <br/>\nsylable possible). :D ah... were was I? Hiragana is used for all  <br/>\ngrammatical features that one might need (words like &quot;and&quot;, &quot;to&quot;,  <br/>\n&quot;when&quot; and showing past tenste and so on ‚Äì these are added to the  <br/>\nKanji, the main words.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo normally, as learners, one starts learning both Hiragana (it takes  <br/>\na few weeks but it is not as difficult and there are many tricks to  <br/>\nlearn the sylables) and some Kanji. Then one starts learning the  <br/>\nKatakana. One never stops learning new Kanji. But with Hiragana and  <br/>\nKatakana one can already spell any word you need and japanese  <br/>\nchildren learn this at firs as well, so they can just write all they  <br/>\nwant until they know enough Kanjisymbols. One generally needs around  <br/>\n5000 Kanji to understand a newspaper, and I&#39;ve seen students who are  <br/>\nreally so interested in learning them, that they will do quite quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good trick is to write the Kanji on small stickies and put them on  <br/>\nthe things they describe. Seeing them everyday caused a friend of  <br/>\nmine learn all of them (about things around the house).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Kanji alone he won&#39;t be able to read anything, he&#39;ll just grasp  <br/>\na little bit what it&#39;s about. He definetly needs Hiragana as well,  <br/>\nand the westernized thing won&#39;t help at all. Katakana can come next.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://members.aol.com/writejapan/\">http://members.aol.com/writejapan/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freejapaneselessons.com/\">http://www.freejapaneselessons.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://genkienglish.net/genkijapan/hiragana1.htm\">http://genkienglish.net/genkijapan/hiragana1.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTrick for learning Hiragana: look at each hiragana symbol and imagine  <br/>\nwhat it could look like. Try to make it look like something that  <br/>\nstarts with the same sylable in English. For instance  the hiragana  <br/>\nsymbol for &quot;a&quot; could be an &quot;anchor&quot;. Draw an anchor into the hiragana  <br/>\nsymbol so that it fits somehow. Later you&#39;ll need to think of the  <br/>\nword you chose - &quot;a - anchor ;  aha, yes that was the one that looks  <br/>\nlike an anchor&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTricks for learning Kanji: I learned them by writing them down  <br/>\nthousands of times. My friend learned them by writing them very  <br/>\nbeautifully like calligriphy and putting them on the things in her  <br/>\nhouse. Another friend would try to figure how it would represent that  <br/>\nthing (they are derived from former symbols which used to represent  <br/>\nthese things). Others would make cards with one side a Kanji, one  <br/>\nside the german word (I did this too and it helps).<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAm 10.10.2006 um 13:08 schrieb anisadancer1218:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Hi all!
