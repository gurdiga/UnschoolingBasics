Today was our first visit to the  <br/>\npsychologist since we&#39;ve started unschooling. We usually visit once a  <br/>\nmonth to discuss Bre and Josh both, how things are going, some ideas  <br/>\nfor me to help them, etc. We&#39;ve missed a few months due to my  <br/>\nbedrest, having a baby, and her father being ill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her how things are going, she watched the kids for a while,  <br/>\nand was very happy for us. She said that she is really excited by the  <br/>\nchanges just in the past few months. There was a huge change just  <br/>\npulling out to homeschool, but unschooling has made them so much  <br/>\nhappier, and she can see all the tension is gone, and they are so  <br/>\nmuch happier. We talked a little bit about the schooling, and *she*  <br/>\nbrought up Holt and some other people who studied schooling during  <br/>\nthe 70&#39;s. Apparently she has her bs and masters in education, she got  <br/>\nthem in the 70&#39;s, and she talked about the backlash of the  <br/>\nbehavioralists after Hold and others talked about developmental  <br/>\nstages in learning. She agrees that the way we&#39;re doing it is the way  <br/>\nall children should be taught. Yay...I have had so many reservations  <br/>\n(internal fears really) about this, and I didn&#39;t want to hear  <br/>\nanything negative about it. We talked a lot more about the general  <br/>\nmovement to accept autistics the way they are, stop trying to stop  <br/>\ntheir behaviors and tics, and just support them in their life. She&#39;s  <br/>\nan awesome woman, and I really appreciate her all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we are so happy, and we&#39;re finally living the life we&#39;re  <br/>\nsupposed to have. We&#39;ve spent the last nine days totally immersed in  <br/>\nChinese New Year....we&#39;ve read all kinds of books, we watched Mulan  <br/>\n(the girls idea) and Big Trouble in Little China (Josh&#39;s idea),  the  <br/>\nkids made a &#39;chart&#39; of who was born in which year, we went shopping  <br/>\nat our favorite asian market and bought a bunch of new things we&#39;ve  <br/>\nnever had the courage for, we made a huge paper mache dragon, we made  <br/>\nkites, tonight my mom came over and taught the girls how to make  <br/>\neggrolls, we had a huge stir fry dinner, we made paper lanterns.
