Our neighbors have four-wheelers and in the South they are<br/>\nvery popular.  Neighbors borrow each other&#39;s four-wheelers, offer each<br/>\nother places to ride them.. fields and so on.  We don&#39;t own one but our<br/>\nneighbors are welcome to ride in our field along the track around it.<br/>\nOther neighbors have a hillock they put in specifically for jumping<br/>\nover<br/>\nwhen they were building their house.  So there&#39;s a variety of choices<br/>\nout here just on one street.  We are in a rural area.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that is all something doable for your ds.  Keep your eyes peeled and<br/>\nask questions.  Something might work out great.  Cost is pretty cheap<br/>\nas<br/>\nlong as you don&#39;t own and I&#39;m sure the owners have a lot of know how to<br/>\nshare.  I know our neighbors LUV to talk about their 4 wheelers.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

Like Pam, I would say to think <br/>\noutside the box a little and try to come up with other solutions.  <br/>\nDo you have a skill or something else that you could trade someone <br/>\nfor a 4-wheeler; could you buy a used one that maybe is not <br/>\noperating and work on it with your son to get it operating (he would <br/>\nbe able to learn the inner workings that way too); buy him <br/>\nmagazines, books, and videos on 4-wheeling, they even race them!  <br/>\nMaybe there is a club in your area that would allow use of one <br/>\nwithout buying one (maybe a friend owns one that he could use once <br/>\nin a while?), there might even be races that you can watch in your <br/>\narea.  This is kind of my own opinion too, so don&#39;t take this the <br/>\nwrong way, but remember that you have your whole life after your <br/>\nkids are gone to make money and you will only have them at home for <br/>\ntoo short of a time.  We just sold our house and quit a high paying <br/>\njob to be able to fulfill our life-long dream of RVing the country <br/>\nfor a year and to move out of Alaska (you can find us at <br/>\nwww.5freebirds.com).  We are in our mid-thirties too so it is a risk <br/>\nbut you only live once!!  Happy hunting for coming up with things!!  <br/>\nI haven&#39;t been good at it in the past but I am getting the hang of <br/>\nit, learning how to think outside the box!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7214,"nextTopicId":7216}}
