He&#39;s horrified as she describes her first  <br/>\nexperience, etc. At one point he asks her to stop the car. He gets out, throws <br/>\n up, gets back in, and asks her to go on.

I was wondering if someone could recommend a book that I could \r<br/>\nread with her about what&#39;s happening with her body. I&#39;m not trying to \r<br/>\nchicken out, but my daughter loves to read, so I thought maybe a book \r<br/>\nwould be better, so that if she gets confused(which happens easily), \r<br/>\nshe can go back and read it again, and I can answer any questions she \r<br/>\nmight have. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI hope this doesn&#39;t sound weird, but she&#39;s my only daughter, and I&#39;ve \r<br/>\nnever had to do this before. I&#39;m not sure this is an unschooling \r<br/>\ntopic, but it&#39;s something she&#39;ll need to understand, and learn about.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks for your help in advance.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n-Vanessa\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nMessages in this topic (1) Reply (via web post) | Start a new topic \r<br/>\nMessages | Files | Photos | Polls | Members \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nChange settings via the Web (Yahoo!

I bought 2 for my <br/>\ndaughter one about puberty and one about emotions.  My daughter is <br/>\n14 and only started her period wihting the last 6 months but showed <br/>\nsigns of hormone swings, breasts, etc. from 10.  She absolutely <br/>\nrefused to talk with me about anything on the topic and she is not a <br/>\nbig reader.  I just gave her the books and would bring up the <br/>\nsubject now and again.  I know she read the books and she did find <br/>\nthem helpful.  She assured me she knew what she needed to know and <br/>\njust did not want to talk about it with me.  I was worried how she <br/>\nwould take getting her period becuase she was so adamant about not <br/>\nwanting to start.  When the time came though she handled it <br/>\nbeautifully.  She told me and let me know what she needed.  She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to miss swimming so started using tampons right away.  <br/>\nShe knew what to do from the books and knew they shouldn&#39;t hurt and <br/>\nhow often to change them.  She was even patient with my asking how <br/>\nshe was (after I let her know I would only do it the first month).  <br/>\nJust last week I checked her if she was regular or having any <br/>\nproblems.   I remenber as a young girl being obsessed about the <br/>\nwhole process so I wasn&#39;t sure how to deal with my girl&#39;s refusal to <br/>\ntalk about it.  Once I knew she did understand what she needed to <br/>\nknow though I let her be.  When the time came to handle it she did <br/>\ngreat and everything turned out fine.  Don&#39;t worry so much about <br/>\ndoing the right thing.  As long as your daughter knows you are there <br/>\nfor her everything will work out.  I was surprized by what a sweet <br/>\nmoment it was though, my only child becoming a young woman.
