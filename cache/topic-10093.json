We live in Oklahoma City. I am <br/>\noriginally from Oklahoma, but just got home in December from a two <br/>\nyear move in the Houston, TX area. I have been unschooling since the <br/>\nbeginning, although I didn&#39;t realize it until about 4 years ago. I <br/>\nhave 3 kids. I have a boy 8, girl 5, and a baby girl 1. I am so glad <br/>\nto be apart of an unschoolers group. <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine and I just started a new yahoo group tonight for <br/>\nchristian unschoolers in the OKC area. If any of you are here in <br/>\nOklahoma, please come and join us too on a local level! We are <br/>\nwanting to get together with people that are in our area as well as <br/>\nonline! I look forward to being a part of this group! <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingchristiansinokcmetro\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingchristiansinokcmetro</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,.· ´¨¨))  -:¦:-<br/>\n             ¸.·´ .·´¨¨))<br/>\n          ((¸¸.·´   .·´   -:¦:-Laura<br/>\n        -:¦:-    ((¸¸.·´*</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10081,"nextTopicId":10083}}
