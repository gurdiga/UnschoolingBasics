It&#39;s about setting her own limits, owning her space, determining and defending her territory, asserting herself.  No is a very powerful for a little person.  And it&#39;s a very normal stage for some kids.  Even 2yo&#39;s who aren&#39;t told no very often have been known to embrace the power of NO.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Really, it will pass -- it&#39;s not something you&#39;ve caused by saying no.  I&#39;ve found with my three kids that respecting their no is the most important step in hearing it less often.  Once I learned and respected the boundaries established by their use of the word no, then they didn&#39;t need it as much, because we didn&#39;t violate their newfound boundaries.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia, who now lives in a house with fewer NO&#39;s, but knows not to expect that word will disappear forever!<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!

My four year old son is autistic, thus he has some processing issues, hyperactivity and he speaks but doesn&#39;t always have the words to express himself fully. I also have two daughters ages 10 and 12. They have issues of their own but not nearly as many as my son. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you is it does get better as they get older. As your older one matures she will understand the difficulties of her little sister. As your little grows and progresses she will be able to do more things, cimmunicate more effectively and this will make her less frustrated. Having all of my kids home together has made a big difference in our lives. They are much closer than they would have been if they were in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nA sibling support group might be helpful for your older daughter if there is one available in your area.  Try to do things seperately with each of your children at least every once in a while. My husband I and I take turns taking the girls to activities that would not be much fun with my son would not enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa in Eugene, OR<br/>\nchrfath816 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrfath@...\">chrfath@...</a>&gt; wrote:     I have been working on saying &quot;yes&quot; more often.
