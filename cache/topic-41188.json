Neither can walking. Neither  <br/>\ncan bike riding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that is counter to what the mainstream says and believes about  <br/>\nreading.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Though even if I were a nut case, no school would guarantee a 6 yo  <br/>\nreading by Thanksgiving. Teachers know that&#39;s not possible for every  <br/>\n6 yo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nReading and walking and bike riding each require several brain areas  <br/>\nto mature in order to coordinate a lot of different actions. Walking  <br/>\nand bike riding involve muscle coordination, balance, vision, and who  <br/>\nknows what else to all be working together in a specific way. Until  <br/>\nthat happens, all the instruction in the world will just likely make  <br/>\nthe child feel like there&#39;s something wrong with them when in reality  <br/>\ntheir brains just aren&#39;t ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is much more complex than it looks. (Though simpler for kids  <br/>\nto puzzle out that it seems it should be!) Reading is more than just  <br/>\nlearning what letter makes what sound and putting them together with  <br/>\na few rules about exceptions. If it were that simple, schools would  <br/>\nhave perfected the instruction long ago! In that way it&#39;s like  <br/>\nwalking and bike riding. You can explain and show but what actually  <br/>\nworks is kids figuring it out on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children learn to read -- without instruction -- in the  <br/>\nsame age range as schooled kids, typically between 6 and 8. That&#39;s  <br/>\nwhen the brain areas needed for decoding typically develop. It also  <br/>\nhappens to coincide with reading instruction so it appears that  <br/>\nreading instruction is responsible for kids reading but since  <br/>\nunschooled kids are reading at the same ages it can&#39;t be the  <br/>\ninstruction. It&#39;s age and being surrounded by the written word.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile schools &quot;require&quot; all kids be reading by 4th grade, the truth  <br/>\nis they aren&#39;t. The kids who aren&#39;t reading are shuttled off to  <br/>\nspecial instruction. But no matter how gently that is done, kids can  <br/>\nend up demoralized and feeling stupid. Or, for self preservation,  <br/>\ndeciding reading is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantage unschoolers have is that our kids learn when they&#39;re  <br/>\ndevelopmentally ready without the demoralization. And if they&#39;re  <br/>\nolder when they first start reading, they&#39;re quickly reading at age  <br/>\nlevel and are indistinguishable from kids who were reading years  <br/>\nearlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Newbie here and a question","postDate":"1251853582","msgId":41197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwOTAxMTgwNng1MDE0NzdhOHIyNDJkYjMwOWI4ZjBjMzU3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU3Rjc5OTc5NDA2RDRBNDVCNTYwOUE2Q0I4MEMwRjZEQFN0ZXBoUHV0ZXI+","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwOTAxMDg1N2lkZmVhOWZtYjRiZWRiYmYyMjcxMWZkMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JIDwxOTUzNjQuNTk0MjQucW1Ad2ViODYyMDUubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPgkgPDY3YTlkNzUwMDkwOTAxMTE0N2w2MTE4YWQxZHI2Y2RhZmVlM2NlYTQyYTkxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPEU3Rjc5OTc5NDA2RDRBNDVCNTYwOUE2Q0I4MEMwRjZEQFN0ZXBoUHV0ZXI+"},"prevInTopic":41191,"nextInTopic":41198,"prevInTime":41196,"nextInTime":41198,"topicId":41188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Stephanie, What your husband is asking for is a tall order.

Unschooling is new to us this school <br/>\n  year. My husband isn&#39;t quite on board with this...yet. He has sort given <br/>\n  my an ultimatum. He wants our 6 year old reading by Thanksgiving. He is <br/>\n  read to learn and is extremely bright....actually he&#39;s so smart its scary. <br/>\n  He comes up with some very deep things at times. Can anyone give me some <br/>\n  suggestions on helping him.....I did teach my older son and daughter to read <br/>\n  with Jessie Wise&#39;s book . It teaches reading phoentically.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks<br/>\n  Stephanie Low<br/>\n  If Tyranny and Oppression come to this land, it will be in the guise of <br/>\n  fighting a foreign enemy.
