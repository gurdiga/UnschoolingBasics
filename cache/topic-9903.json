I remember once, in desperation, putting  <br/>\nRoya and Rox in the tub and giving them a dozen eggs, some small  <br/>\nbowls, a couple of egg beaters and some other stuff - oh, I remember  <br/>\n-- it was a bag of potato chips!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time I remember I grabbed tubes of  fingerpaint and and a big  <br/>\nbag of cotton balls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched for things in stores that I could buy - things in the  <br/>\ndollar bins, for example - that I could stash away and pull out when  <br/>\nit seemed like trouble was brewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDistraction was my best tool.
