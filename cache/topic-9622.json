But my neices go to ps in Tillamook County Oregon. Things get kinda bad for my youngest neice, but never that bad. Gosh your poor son. I mean what if you went to the store and someone did that to you. At least you could get the police involved. My neices have trouble more with nasty sexual behavior from the kids. I don&#39;t know how to help them with that. I just try to let them know that that isn&#39;t very acceptable behavior. Though it seems to be the norm in school. Just my thoughts.
