I&#39;ve been uncomfortable w/ the idea of treats as the<br/>\nmotivator for all the training.  Maybe it&#39;s my own food issues but it never<br/>\nfelt right. I wonder if there could be some other motivator that would work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when Gus was just a pup and I was trying to get him to shake<br/>\nhands.  He would just stare at me.  Then one day I broke open the treats and<br/>\nwhat do you know, up came the paw.  It was as though he had gotten a call<br/>\nfrom the Dog Union and they told him to hold out for the treats.  They were<br/>\nsupposed to get paid big time for performing such un-dog like things.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever train a dog to do those things again.  But the safety<br/>\nstuff is so important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2897,"nextTopicId":2901}}
