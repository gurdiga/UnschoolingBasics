Often any number of options can be helpful - from something as simple as offering a snack or putting on a movie to what&#39;s described above. It can help to keep that in mind (change something!) as a tool for when you Start to see things go south. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, not all kids respond well to being removed from a situation - and chances are even a child who Often responds well, won&#39;t every time. It&#39;s helpful to try and step back from looking for One perfect solution and instead build up a set of skills and tools and options which can be adapted to fit a variety of situations - because that&#39;s the way life is, so much of the time. What &quot;works&quot; at home may not work at a friend&#39;s house, or on the playground, or when someone&#39;s hungry or tired. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;The amount of time it is taking to calm down is reducing quite rapidly<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s great! A lot of time what&#39;s happening when you get that effect is you&#39;re taking your own issues out of the mix - your own reaction to your child&#39;s upset or the situation preceding it. Stepping back from your own &quot;stuff&quot; and instead focusing on your child&#39;s needs can help to keep the upset from escalating - which means it all blows over sooner. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a danger worth pointing out, though, in the idea that the &quot;goal&quot; is to reduce the amount of time your child is upset. Sometimes when a person is emotional, what he or she most needs is to ride out the emotional storm, as it were.

And at 8 he is dealing with his own life, his own growth, his <br/>\nown development of empathy and understanding of other people in a slow <br/>\nway. It isn&#39;t all reaction, but it is also something that cannot be <br/>\nlectured or shouted or punished into changing. It can be nurtured <br/>\nthrough kindness and patience. You can <br/>\nhelp him, and your other children, by keeping them fed and hydrated. By <br/>\nwatching for evidence of tension mounting. I can see when Simon is <br/>\nmoving toward frustrated and I can turn him with distractions or <br/>\nsomething else to do or conversation or food or a drink. The earlier I <br/>\nspot the tension on the rise, the easier it is for it not to happen. And the more that I do that, the less likely any of is going to lose it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to feel my expression of frustration and anger as a switch that <br/>\nturned on at some point in a moment. I went from being calm and even <br/>\njoking to angry and I didn&#39;t know how to not flip the switch. It has <br/>\ntaken time on my part as well as making sure that I&#39;m not hungry or too <br/>\ntired or coming into any engagement with too many expectations. Make <br/>\nsure, as much as you can, that you aren&#39;t coming into moments with your children already frayed. And work not to take his anger as evidence <br/>\nthat something is failing to work. He&#39;s frustrated and doesn&#39;t yet have <br/>\nbetter tools for dealing with it. Given the list of things you&#39;ve done <br/>\nin the past to try and make him behave in the way you want him to, you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t had great tools to deal with your own frustration and your <br/>\ngrown. Help him to see more options by finding more options for your own self.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reetabix_knits@...\">reetabix_knits@...</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:reetabix_knits@...\">reetabix_knits@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Sunday, 4 March 2012, 18:55<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] How to deal with aggression, tantrums etc?<br/>\n <br/>\nWe<br/>\n are moving from quite authoritative parenting to unschooling.

My son likes to throw dirt clods from teh garden out onto the wall outside. OR jump on bubble wrap. Or rip pages from the phone book. He has anger he expresses in shouting, and we certainly don&#39;t like it but it sure beats hitting someone, so that&#39;s self-control,right?

As Nance mentioned, it takes time to change, for your son and for you, too. Part of what will help your son is for you to really notice the positive in him - even if for now the positive you&#39;re seeing is &quot;well, that wasn&#39;t Nearly as bad as it could have been&quot;. I&#39;m not saying you should praise him, but notice when he&#39;s happier, when he handles things better - and let him know you&#39;re noticing. If he&#39;s had a lot of negative feedback, it will soothe his heart to hear good things about himself. He may have gotten in the habit of thinking of himself as &quot;the bad kid&quot; so he&#39;ll need your help to undo that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;But still if he can&#39;t do something (a classic example would be playing on the ipad when his sister is on it) he will still get incredibly angry, shouting, swearing, stomping off and throwing things around.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nDo what you can so the other kids don&#39;t feel the brunt of his anger. Protect them. It could help even to reassure them that the anger isn&#39;t about them, or that they are loved and cherished while he is raging. It could help to get more of the favorite household resources! If the ipad is a big deal, it could help Everyone in the family to get more than one, or to get something similar - depending on what it&#39;s being used for. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to saying Yes more, look for more ways to be proactive about your son&#39;s needs. It could be that he has bigger needs than other kids in the family - for attention, for instance, or activity. If you&#39;ve been giving him roughly the same kind of attention and care as you would any of your other kids, you may be doing him a disservice, leaving him &quot;half full&quot; as it were - and so he&#39;s needy and on edge, with less resources to deal with problems. The more you can do to &quot;fill him up&quot; the more resources he&#39;ll have to draw from when things go south. It may, on the outside, seem unfair to give one person more time and energy than any other, but chances are you&#39;re already giving him more time and energy in terms of dealing with the fallout of his unhappiness - and That&#39;s not fair to other members of the family, either. It ends up being kinder all around to meet his needs fully (and proactively, when at all possible!) than to always be cleaning up from his emotional messes, if you see what I mean. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: How to deal with aggression, tantrums etc?","postDate":"1330948849","msgId":47991,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqMjl0aCtjN3ZoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpqMGRyNys2OGhsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47990,"nextInTopic":47999,"prevInTime":47990,"nextInTime":47992,"topicId":47990,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, you were doing it the other way for all of his 8 years.
