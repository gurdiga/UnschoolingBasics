At first, she spent so much time in front of the computer, and I thought it was all on myspace, but I found out she was surfing other sites as well. She read all about animal rights groups and global warming, and got into creating a very eclectic collection of music downloaded from limewire, and now burns CD&#39;s for people based on what they would love to hear. She has devoted so much time to myspace, instant messaging and text messaging on her phone that for awhile I thought maybe she was spending too much time on a social life, but now I realize that her social intelligence is a great strength and I would not interfere with it for anything.  Social networking via the internet is a modern marvel, really, and myspace is a great place to learn about other parts of the country and lifestyles, as well as web page building and design. <br/>\n<br/>\nI found that goal setting was a good way to encourage a varied lifestyle.

As with other interests over the past few years, he has  immersed <br/>\nhimself in it.  I guess my questions to you would be...<br/>\n <br/>\n Why do you wish his interest in online video games will wain?   What would <br/>\nbe something you consider more valuable for him?   What if  he was playing <br/>\nbasketball for hours every day?  Reading for hours  everyday?<br/>\nPlaying the guitar?  Why would any of those things be more important  that <br/>\nwhat he considers important to him right now?<br/>\n <br/>\nLogan is playing WOW right now most of his waking hours and  I&#39;ve started <br/>\njust going in and being in the room with him as he  plays.  He seems to really <br/>\nenjoy me being there and explains all that is  going on.<br/>\n <br/>\n  Last night, he came into the kitchen when I was cooking and  said,,,&quot;I need <br/>\na hug&quot;.   He felt this need to connect with me and we  sat on the kitchen <br/>\ncounter and talked about WOW for awhile.  I truly am  interested in learning more <br/>\nabout it and he asked if I would like to create a  character.  So I did.  We <br/>\nwent into his room and he helped me with  learning how to create the character <br/>\nand start a quest.  It was extremely  challenging for me just to make my <br/>\ncharacter walk in a straight line!  &lt;g&gt;  I really did enjoy it in spite of my <br/>\nfrustration and plan on  playing more today.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI know from seeing him over the years develop interests and immerse  himself <br/>\nin them that it will wane a bit when the weather gets warmer and there  will <br/>\nbe something new.  It may well be another video game but whatever it  is will <br/>\nbe valuable to him for whatever amount of time he is involved with  it.  I&#39;m <br/>\nthe very same way!  If I&#39;m doing a house project, that&#39;s all  I do until I <br/>\nfinish it.  Last fall, I got involved in doing Zumba which is  a Latin exercise <br/>\nprogram and I spent months going to classes, get certified to  teach it, finding <br/>\nmusic for it and thinking about it most of my waking  hours.  It would have <br/>\nbeen quite disheartening if someone in my  family<br/>\nhad wished that my interest would wain and I would find something else to  <br/>\ndo.  They were just as supportive of me as I try to be of their  interests.<br/>\n <br/>\nRather than waiting for some other interest to develop, try and find out  <br/>\nmore about WOW.  Play yourself or at least learn enough about it to share  the <br/>\nexcitement.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLast night, in Logan&#39;s room, I picked up the box that the WOW game   had come <br/>\nin and was reminded that it was made by Blizzard.  An unschooling  teen we <br/>\nknow immersed himself in video games and now has a job working for  them.

Not even computer games, lol! Well, she IS doing  <br/>\nMyspace a great deal and listening to music more, which I&#39;m glad of. <br/>\n <br/>\nRemembering the process takes time is hard for me - especially with her  <br/>\nfather and other side of the family getting antsy and wanting her to show her  <br/>\nwork (and there is none). It&#39;s hard to wait out deschooling - especially when  <br/>\n*I* am so excited about her future now, lol, and I want her to be too. But in  <br/>\ntime, the deschooling works - all that have done it, say it&#39;s so, and I figure  <br/>\nTHEY know, lol. Plus, my son, who is now 18, left school 18 or so months ago <br/>\n-  and within 13 months (as long as he was schooled, mind you), he stopped <br/>\ngelling  out and really began enjoying learning for the sake of learning again. <br/>\nHe now  spends hours at a time learning guitar and learning about Buddhism. He <br/>\ntook the  time needed to discover his interests and now he&#39;s developing them <br/>\non his own.  Grace, my daughter, will get there too...but it IS hard to &quot;wait&quot; <br/>\nfor that. <br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Start the year off right.

What if you <br/>\nwere to sit with him while he&#39;s playing and really try to understand <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s doing and what all the things mean on the site?  How about <br/>\ncreating a WoW character yourself and playing with him coaching <br/>\nyou?  Or even getting your own account and playing with him?  Not so <br/>\nmuch to intrude on his space, but to embrace it with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the very least, since you are willing to facilitate his curiosity <br/>\nin other areas, can you sort of suspend disbelief a little and <br/>\npretend that WoW is one of these other areas and facilitate it the <br/>\nway you might facilitate a passion for architecture or knitting or <br/>\nanimal care or any other thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyparenting.com\">http://www.joyfullyparenting.com</a><br/>\nLive Fully ~ Live JoyFully!<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155775465,"authorName":"Amy","from":"&quot;Amy&quot; &lt;avd@...&gt;","profile":"momofonespirit","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"unschooling a teen","postDate":"1201453766","msgId":29073,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZuaWRzNitzMmZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":29075,"prevInTime":29072,"nextInTime":29074,"topicId":29073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I want to thank everyone for helping understand unschooling; just reading the posts helps!
