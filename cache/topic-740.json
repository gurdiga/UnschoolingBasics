Me and Dada got in the tub (we have a big one), and started laughing and splashing and blowing bubbles.  He played in there for nearly an hour and really didn&#39;t want to get out but he insisted on running cold water and he was getting shivery and blue.  I&#39;ll think he&#39;ll get in more easily again soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to this last digest, I think the posts were under strong reaction to TV.  This is one of the discussions that turned me off of another site...I think that TV can definitely raise negative issues.  I recognize that there is a lot of valuable programming available and perhaps I need to remember that these folks are probably referring to much older kids.  We do have a TV.  I want to remove it to the closet.  We do not have cable, we usually can&#39;t get PBS...and like you said, Arthur and other stuff on there is just junk....and they all go to school.  I really do not want to have to talk Will out of wanting to go to school...I&#39;m not that comfortable having the issue raised repeatedly in my living room by Public Broadcasting.  I do LOVE those brothers Chris and Martin and would love to have all their episodes.  Will is interested in watching Jay Jay and he never seems to be interested in watching any tv at all.  We go to Grandpa&#39;s...who has a BIG screen and cable...if I turn on<br/>\n Sesame Street Will screams &quot;TURN TV OFF!!!!&quot; every time.  He likes Animal Planet.  Grandpa turns looking for cartoons (boy there&#39;s some aweful crap on those)...I keep telling him...channel 54.   Anyway.  William saw something on ER (my fault...a weakness and why I need to put the damn thing away), a terrible wreck...and I might would go so far as to say it damaged him.  I don&#39;t want him eating his dinner listening to the news either.  He doesn&#39;t need to have death tolls and the fact that there is terrible craziness and wars broadcast into his head so young in his life.  He will certainly have to learn all about our world...and I certainly hope that his father and I will infect him with our love of peace.  He wants to be an astronaut and go to the moon and Mars and if he decides to do that then that will probably mean Air Force (Gulp!) ooooh Pray for Peace.  Yeah, I admit I do kindof see the TV and also advertising and media as an evil...I hate having to tell Will what all the things<br/>\n they are advertising are.  And also, I have been laying in bed trying to space and all through my head go all the stupid jingles or some song from a kids tape. Or Will sings a stupid jingle...I just don&#39;t think we need all kinds of random crap floating into our brains.  I think maybe I am sensitive auditively like some of your kids.  We will absolutely not be paying $50 a month for channels on TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I balked when I read it, but you guys are right, I do HAVE to get Will his own computer...this just amazes me.<br/>\n<br/>\nramblin on-<br/>\n<br/>\nMillie Rosa<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
