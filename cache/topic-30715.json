But you all are right I<br/>\nneed to wait when everything is calm/fine or whatever and just talk<br/>\nabout this.  My dh&#39;s mother died when he was 2 so he doesn&#39;t remember<br/>\nher well. His father remarried a year later and had 4 kids with his<br/>\nnew wife. Dh was raised by his older siblings. Whenever he did see his<br/>\ndad, his dad was very strict and did give the belt, yell, whatever if<br/>\nneeded.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s REALLY, REALLY helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he never really had a strong mom who was *his* protector and <br/>\nnurturer. AND he doesn&#39;t have a gentle dad-role model.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk---put yourself there. You&#39;re five. Your real mom&#39;s dead. Your <br/>\nstep-mom has four older kids or four tiny ones (can&#39;t tell by the <br/>\ndescription)---either way, doesn&#39;t have time for *you*. You&#39;re raised <br/>\nby older siblings (children who probably don&#39;t have a lot of skills in <br/>\nhandling smaller children---probably weren&#39;t a lot modeled for *them* <br/>\neither!). ANd your father&#39;s MO was to use the belt and yell.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t that SUCK??!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFind a quiet time and talk a LOT about this. Find out what he would <br/>\nhave liked to have had done when he was little. Suggest that maybe <br/>\nRomeo could have a better relationship with him as a father IF he <br/>\nwanted to. The only person that can change him is His-Own-Self---but <br/>\nthat YOU are there to help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he does want to change, maybe come up with a secret &quot;cue&quot; word that <br/>\neither of you can use with the other: something you can say to him if <br/>\nyou think he&#39;s getting out of control and something he can say to you <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s feeling about to burst.<br/>\n<br/>\n***IMPORTANT*** When either of you uses the word, the the behavior MUST <br/>\nSTOP NOW!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you say it, he needs to back off and let you handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he says it, you must be willing to stop whatever you are doing to <br/>\nhelp him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important for him to know that you aren&#39;t saying he&#39;s a bad dad. <br/>\nIt&#39;s just that you know he needs help in this &quot;low skills&quot; area of his <br/>\nand that you won&#39;t criticize him for his bad decisions. He needs to put <br/>\nmore tools in his tool box. Right now, all he has is 1) yelling and 2) <br/>\near-pinching (Does he need his own ear pinched to remember how that <br/>\nfeels?) He may feel that he&#39;s doing better than his own dad because <br/>\nhe&#39;s NOT using the belt. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s *good* to ear pinch? <br/>\nNo, but for *him* it might be a step in the right direction. He just <br/>\nneeds a LOT more tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs to feel supported---AND *NOT* out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\nYOU need to know that your children are as safe and and happy as you <br/>\nwish he had been when he was little. Tell him if *YOU* had been his <br/>\nmom, you wold NEVER have allowed him to be treated like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you aren&#39;t his mom, you&#39;re *Romeo&#39;s* mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nCommiserate with him if he will allow himself to mourn for that little <br/>\nboy that he was.

So I<br/>\nwent in to see what was wrong. He was upset because his lego house had<br/>\ncame apart. Dh heard him and came in Romeo&#39;s room too. Dh wanted to<br/>\nknow what was wrong. So Romeo explained that he was upset that his<br/>\nlego house had came apart and that now he&#39;d have to put it back<br/>\ntogether again. Dh said something like oh it&#39;ll be ok and don&#39;t cry<br/>\nabout it! So then Dh left the room and he heard Romeo crying again<br/>\nabout it. So he went back in Romeo&#39;s room and this time yelled at him<br/>\nand said, &quot; Why are you crying? and he repeated it like 4 times. Romeo<br/>\nwas just sobbing then and so he grabbed him by the ear and yanked him<br/>\noff the bed. Then said,&quot; I said stop crying! Pick up all your legos<br/>\nnow&quot;.  I was in the living room with the little ones but he was loud<br/>\nenough and so I could hear the whole convo. So I went in and Romeo was<br/>\ncrying hard this time and his ear was bright red. And so I asked Dh<br/>\nwhat was wrong. I then tried to help Romeo pick up his legos so Dh<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be mad anymore. Then when we were done picking up legos I<br/>\nfollowed Dh into the living room. I said,&quot; What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; I<br/>\nmean if he wants to cry in his room why don&#39;t you let him?&quot; He&#39;s not<br/>\nbothering anyone. &quot; He&#39;s upset about his legos.&quot;  And dh says &quot; he is<br/>\ncrying and he is bothering someone&quot;. Then Romeo who followed us into<br/>\nthe living room says something. I can&#39;t remember but then Dh says stop<br/>\nyelling at me and repeated that like 3 times. I didn&#39;t think he was<br/>\nyelling he just talks a little bit louder than most people. It really<br/>\nbugs dh though.  Then Romeo raised his hand or touched his head or<br/>\nsomething and Dh says don&#39;t  think you&#39;re going to hit me cause it<br/>\nwill never happen! I mean he overreacts and is so hard on Romeo. Then<br/>\nDh goes to our room and we don&#39;t talk to each other.

He is probably feeling defensive, and he is reaction was <br/>\nbased on the way he was treated when he was a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy DH and I have some big parenting differences.  Occasionally he <br/>\nover reacts and I pick up the pieces. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most effective thing I have found to change my DH mind, is to <br/>\npractice peaceful parenting.  When he sees things working for me, he <br/>\ntries them.  When I see him doing something that works, I comment on <br/>\nhow well it worked.  For instance, Logan (4) has had a terrible time <br/>\nadjusting to the Sunday School class I teach.  DH is helping me with <br/>\nthe class.  DH has tried getting angry, time-outs, etc to get Logan <br/>\nto join in the class.  Still, Sunday after Sunday, Logan refused to <br/>\nparticipate for the most part. Then one Sunday, DH spent a little <br/>\ntime play wrestling Logan, when he started his normal refusal.  Next <br/>\nthing you know Logan was happily participating in class.  I commented <br/>\nhow amazing that Logan participated after DH got done play <br/>\nwrestling.  Since then, DH uses that tactic and Sunday School is <br/>\nsmoother for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it is kinda like I unschool my DH, giving him room to find what <br/>\nworks for him.

I bought Connection Parenting and  <br/>\nloaded it on my dh&#39;s ipod. I don&#39;t even think he listened to the whole  <br/>\nthing. Anyway, last night Romeo (age 9) was in his room crying. So I  <br/>\nwent in to see what was wrong. He was upset because his lego house had  <br/>\ncame apart. Dh heard him and came in Romeo&#39;s room too. Dh wanted to  <br/>\nknow what was wrong. So Romeo explained that he was upset that his  <br/>\nlego house had came apart and that now he&#39;d have to put it back  <br/>\ntogether again. Dh said something like oh it&#39;ll be ok and don&#39;t cry  <br/>\nabout it! So then Dh left the room and he heard Romeo crying again  <br/>\nabout it. So he went back in Romeo&#39;s room and this time yelled at him  <br/>\nand said, &quot; Why are you crying? and he repeated it like 4 times. Romeo  <br/>\nwas just sobbing then and so he grabbed him by the ear and yanked him  <br/>\noff the bed. Then said,&quot; I said stop crying! Pick up all your legos  <br/>\nnow&quot;.  I was in the living room with the little ones but he was loud  <br/>\nenough and so I could hear the whole convo. So I went in and Romeo was  <br/>\ncrying hard this time and his ear was bright red. And so I asked Dh  <br/>\nwhat was wrong. I then tried to help Romeo pick up his legos so Dh  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be mad anymore. Then when we were done picking up legos I  <br/>\nfollowed Dh into the living room. I said,&quot; What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; I  <br/>\nmean if he wants to cry in his room why don&#39;t you let him?&quot; He&#39;s not  <br/>\nbothering anyone. &quot; He&#39;s upset about his legos.&quot;  And dh says &quot; he is  <br/>\ncrying and he is bothering someone&quot;. Then Romeo who followed us into  <br/>\nthe living room says something. I can&#39;t remember but then Dh says stop  <br/>\nyelling at me and repeated that like 3 times. I didn&#39;t think he was  <br/>\nyelling he just talks a little bit louder than most people. It really  <br/>\nbugs dh though.  Then Romeo raised his hand or touched his head or  <br/>\nsomething and Dh says don&#39;t  think you&#39;re going to hit me cause it  <br/>\nwill never happen! I mean he overreacts and is so hard on Romeo. Then  <br/>\nDh goes to our room and we don&#39;t talk to each other. I know he was mad  <br/>\nbecause I said something to him and especially in front of the kids.   <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t like me telling him not to do this or that with Romeo and I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what else to do or how to handle this. I thought by putting  <br/>\nthat Connection Parenting on his ipod that he&#39;d understand. But he  <br/>\njust doesn&#39;t agree with kids being our equals.  Please help me!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\nMama to Romeo, Destiny, and Isabella</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30640,"nextTopicId":30803}}
