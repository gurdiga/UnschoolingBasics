If it was because she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1443240396\">-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:carebear-79@...\">carebear-79@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was none the wiser to the toll it was taking on me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nSO why didn&#39;t you tell her?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was because she might say, &quot;I told you so,&quot; maybe that was why. <br/>\nThat happens a lot. Parents warn children of the dire consequences then <br/>\nget to &quot;gloat&quot; in a way that they were right. That the child wasn&#39;t <br/>\nready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important for me to know that my kids can trust me if they aren&#39;t <br/>\ncommfortable with something they see or hear. They know I will isten <br/>\nand help them through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis extends to drugs and drinking and sex---I could say, &quot;Don&#39;t do <br/>\nit,&quot; or I could say, &quot; When you decide you&#39;re ready to explore, be <br/>\nsmart about it. Let me help you through. Trust me to be there when you <br/>\nneed me. Call me if you&#39;re ever in trouble.&quot; Saying, &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; won&#39;t <br/>\ngain their trust. Saying, &quot;I&#39;m here if you need me---no matter *how* <br/>\nbad it is,&quot; will show them that I am their partner in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took a<br/>\nvery long time before I opened up to my mom about my fears.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Why didn&#39;t you tell her?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I just don&#39;t agree with the line of thinking that what our <br/>\nchildren watch on TV doesn&#39;t have an<br/>\naffect on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything effects us. It&#39;s whether they have our support that is the <br/>\ndifference.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI really do believe in self-regulation for children, but with TV I&#39;m <br/>\nnot so sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh? It&#39;s a box. With an on/off switch.<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s influence is much more powerful than we give it credit <br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a lot of fear for a box.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do think children take in what they watch and absorb it. They may <br/>\nnot understand as we adults do and<br/>\nhow they process it may be even worse than we think.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all take in parts of what we watch. Many adults don&#39;t understad <br/>\nparts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we are there for them and helping them through, it&#39;s not scary <br/>\nOR more powerful than the children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI should clarify that I am not against television for religious<br/>\nreasons, as I get asked that a lot. It purely from my experience with<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYour expereince that it&#39;s more pwerful than you are?<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not see any benefit to television.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nANY????<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a television in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to <br/>\ntell my<br/>\nchildren they couldn&#39;t watch tv while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten rid of it<br/>\naltogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>\nhassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about what they<br/>\nwatch, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without a TV in the<br/>\nhouse. I want my children (at least in their younger years) to grow<br/>\nup with a reverence for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have a computer in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to <br/>\ntell my<br/>\nchildren they couldn&#39;t work on the computer while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten <br/>\nrid of it<br/>\naltogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>\nhassle it seems to cause.

I want my children (at least in their younger years) to grow<br/>\nup with a reverence for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have books in my home. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be fair to tell my <br/>\n<br/>\nchildren they couldn&#39;t read books while I did, so I&#39;ve gotten rid of <br/>\nthem<br/>\naltogether. Therefore (at least for the time being) eliminating the<br/>\nhassle it seems to cause. I don&#39;t have to worry about what they<br/>\nread, because it&#39;s not simply not an option without any books in the<br/>\nhouse. I want my children (at least in their younger years) to grow<br/>\nup with a reverence for the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound any better? Worse?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that unschooling is about giving our children access to<br/>\nwhat they love. I really do. I understand it is about connection &<br/>\nsharing. I understand that forbidding something makes it even worse.<br/>\nHowever, do we really think that a murder scene on TV is what our<br/>\nyoung children want to see,<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat young child WANTS to see a murder seen?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy always-unschooled 11 year old does NOT want to see murder or sex or <br/>\nviolence. He turns the channel or leave the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nor is it simply wanting to be close to a<br/>\nparent who is watching such a show that they really want?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat parent is NOT respecting the child. I have TiVo. If Duncan wants <br/>\nto hang with me, but I&#39;m watching Law & Order, I&#39;ll record it to watch <br/>\nearly the next morning before he&#39;s awake. AMazingly, he&#39;ll do the same <br/>\nthing if Aqua Teen Hunger Force is on because *I* don&#39;t want to watch <br/>\nthat. We respect each other&#39;s choices and personal boundaries. We don&#39;t <br/>\nimpose ours on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs wanting to be part of the conversation between mom & dad what they <br/>\nwant, as<br/>\nopposed to watching the news itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t have both?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I alone here? Is their anyone out there that has similar feelings?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure that there are others out here, but I hope they are trying to <br/>\nget past that because it&#39;ll make unschooling blossom is they can get <br/>\npast those limited feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to get flack for this post. Really, I&#39;m giving my <br/>\nthoughts most sincerely. I&#39;m<br/>\ncurious to know if others feel this way, and if not what is the <br/>\nreasoning?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasoning is that my kids like to make their own choices. They may <br/>\nnot always be the same choices *I* make, but they&#39;re learning how they <br/>\nworld works and what works for hem. My goal is that I want them to be <br/>\ncomfortable making that big transition of moving out on their own <br/>\n(Cameron, at 19, is close) and tarting their own families. Without the <br/>\nopportunity to make their own decisions, their own choices----and even <br/>\ntheir own learning-takes (commonly called mistakes)---they will have no <br/>\nbasis to start with.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
