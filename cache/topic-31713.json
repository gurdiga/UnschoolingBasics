Then the texting started, so Daddy got him <br/>\nunlimited texting. &lt;g&gt; Now it&#39;s all ironed out. He may choose to stop <br/>\npaying once Cameron is 21 or in his own house--hard to tell. But it&#39;s <br/>\nbeen good for both of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time, Cameron was the only one with a phone. Two years ago, <br/>\nI gave Ben (and me) Valentine&#39;s phones. Ben rides his bicycle to and <br/>\n from work every day, and I wanted him to be able to call me if he had a <br/>\nflat tire or was in trouble. It&#39;s paid for itself already. Neither of <br/>\nus uses our phones all that much, but they&#39;re handy. We have zillions <br/>\nof unused minutes every month, and they rollover. I&#39;d like to get a <br/>\n&quot;fewer calls&quot; plan, but this company doesn&#39;t allow that unless they&#39;re <br/>\nrunning a special of some kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, I gave Duncan (12, then 11) one for his birthday. It has <br/>\nfree long distance, so he can call his friends in Atlanta, Minnesota, <br/>\nTennessee, and Boston any time; and when he&#39;s visiting any of them <br/>\nwithOUT me, he has easy phone access all the time. He&#39;s usually in <br/>\nAtlanta for a week at a time, and I&#39;d rather have a quick line to him <br/>\nif either of us needs to get in touch. He&#39;ll be in the Boston area in <br/>\nMay for a week without me (and flying there too), so again, he&#39;ll have <br/>\na direct line to me. I like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce though---very shortly after getting it, he was staying with <br/>\nfriends in Atlanta and lost it. We believe it was on the counter and <br/>\nwas knocked into the trash, maybe, by the cat. So we had insurance and <br/>\ngot a new one with a $50 fee. Overall, he&#39;s been very careful since.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still have a landline, but are considering losing that since we all <br/>\nhave cells now.

I certainly<br/>\nunderstand if there are budget issues though I think these can generally be<br/>\ntossed around and the money likely found in all but the most dire of<br/>\nfinancial circumstances- it&#39;s usually quite affordable to add another line<br/>\nto an existing contract- but of course as a family you may decide there are<br/>\nother priorities. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, none of my children has their own cell phone.  My 8yo has<br/>\nmentioned wanting her own phone in passing (kind of like mentioning wanting<br/>\nher own pony), but I don&#39;t think she fully comprehends that we&#39;d still have<br/>\nthe same number of minutes to share so it wouldn&#39;t change the fact that we<br/>\nhave to watch our calling during the &quot;work week&quot;.  We have a fairly tight<br/>\nbudget ourselves and we&#39;ve never had the full discussion.   We do want to<br/>\nprovide a phone for our 13yo as he begins to stay home alone more, and may<br/>\nventure out on his own more, but it also may work out to fit everyone&#39;s<br/>\nneeds better if we&#39;d just get a land line hooked up again (we&#39;re cell only).<br/>\nSo far the main need for Logan is to have a phone for safety reasons when<br/>\nhe&#39;s home alone and Ayden&#39;s main wish is to have unlimited calling to her<br/>\nfriends any time she wants it.
