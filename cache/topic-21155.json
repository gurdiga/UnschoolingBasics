Maybe also read on sandradodd.com regarding testing<br/>\nand how to make it &quot;invalid&quot; in your eyes while satisfying the crossed<br/>\nt&#39;s and dotted i&#39;s of the legalities. Note that testing doesn&#39;t start<br/>\nuntil what would be &quot;4th grade&quot; and is only done alternate years until<br/>\ngrade 9. So, 4th, 6th, and 8th would be tests, 1st-3rd, 5th, and 7th<br/>\ncould be narrative/alternate method, then testing every year for &quot;high<br/>\nschool&quot;. The &#39;composite score&#39; of the test must be above the 33rd<br/>\n*percentile* (that&#39;s not percent, it&#39;s percentile - that means that of<br/>\nthose taking that same test at the same general timeframe, 1/3 do worse<br/>\nthan your child and 2/3 do better - not all that hard really. If 12 kids<br/>\ntake a 100 question test, 3 kids get 1 question correct, your child gets<br/>\n2 questions correct and the rest get 3 questions correct, then even<br/>\nthough the score would be 2%, it would also be at/above 33rd<br/>\npercentile).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
