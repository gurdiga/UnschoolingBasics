I didnï¿½t know that Renï¿½s son didnï¿½t read until then, but<br/>\nI knew that he only recently started to enjoy writing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me clarify...he doesn&#39;t really &quot;enjoy writing&quot; in the sense that<br/>\nhe writes for pleasure, he writes when it&#39;s useful to him for a game<br/>\nor other purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe began reading fluently AFTER he turned 12. Most of his fluent<br/>\nreading has happened this very year (he turned 12 in August) but he<br/>\nwent from asking me to read almost everything to absorbing and reading<br/>\nalmost anything recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night he was working very hard on a Zelda game. He had the<br/>\nwalk-through up on my compuer and when he hit snags he&#39;d come running<br/>\nin and read how to deal with that area. A walk-through is one of the<br/>\nmost technical, detailed and BORING (only to me of course) bits of<br/>\nwriting in the world.  I tried reading some of it and could not wrap<br/>\nmy mind around it. Very detailed stuff.  He was reading it AND<br/>\napplying that information in a way that made sense. He was using it to<br/>\ndecode a game.  NOT simple reading at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust. It always comes back to that simple word. You can&#39;t have<br/>\nunschooling without it...but you have to constantly up your trust<br/>\nquotient to get to the next level.:)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt first you trust that your child will learn outside of school, then<br/>\nyou begin to trust that they don&#39;t need lessons and curriculum, then<br/>\nyou realize they really need only a RICH and interesting and<br/>\nsupportive environment in order to learn well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn every step, the trust had to come first, THEN you see natural<br/>\nlearning unfold. When we hit that pocket of fear, it&#39;s OUR job to work<br/>\nthrough it without dumping our shit on our children. Lots of internal<br/>\ndialogue, lots of talking at the lists and lots of questioning can<br/>\nhelp work through those rough spots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ve come a LONG way in a short time Sandy...it&#39;s been so<br/>\nmuch fun to hear how the unschooling journey is flowing in your home.<br/>\n And it&#39;s really great to hear how you&#39;re standing up to your dh and<br/>\nhe&#39;s responding.  That&#39;s how we got 100% to unschooling...I had to<br/>\nreally be convinced enough to tell him to trust ME if he couldn&#39;t<br/>\ntrust the kids.  You should hear him in discussions now, totally<br/>\ncracks me up that he was ever unsure.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"aplan4life","from":"&quot;aplan4life&quot; &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling support group recommendation","postDate":"1146441591","msgId":12669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzM2oxbitnY3B2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUzM2ZybSs5djFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12663,"nextInTopic":12691,"prevInTime":12668,"nextInTime":12670,"topicId":12663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Ren, I do need GROWTH via encouragement, :-)  Maybe I ve misread a post here or there and had a little mind clutter but for some reason I wasn t sure if","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-740391072\">Thanks Ren, I do need GROWTH via encouragement, :-)  Maybe I&#39;ve<br/>\nmisread a post here or there and had a little mind clutter but for<br/>\nsome reason I wasn&#39;t sure if it was okay to ask support type<br/>\nquestions.
