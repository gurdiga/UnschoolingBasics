Thanks for the insight and analogy, it made it quite clear we aren&#39;t cut out for this right now.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t decide that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of us here, started out with less than ideal circumstances. Most of us (I would guess) are still unlearning some of those old tapes in our heads. Some of us have just had more time to fully ingest and analyze the way we were raised, our reactions and thoughts, the ideas that get in the way of joyful connections.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI work 30 hours per week right now, that&#39;s less than &quot;ideal&quot; in many ways. But it is what we choose for the moment, as the best option for our family. Unschooling can flourish in a number of less than &quot;ideal&quot; situations if we are able to be creative and think hard about how to partner with our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I went to a hairdresser that tried to talk my kid out of the hair they wanted and refused to do color, I&#39;d say &quot;no thanks&quot; and walk right out. It takes a while to realize how society treats children as lesser beings, but the more you awaken to that reality, the better an advocate you can be for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing an advocate for your child and partnering with them can be a focus whether unschooling happens or not. If a child wants to leave school though, you need to find a way to make it happen as fast as possible if you are to take her needs seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only situations I can think of in which leaving school is not an option, is if social services is involved or if there is an ex who is causing problems. Other issues are usually pretty easy to deal with and we could give you ideas about how to make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep on trying to look directly at your children and connecting with them. As you do this and learn to trust their inclinations, unschooling can begin to unfold, even when life isn&#39;t perfect.:) But when is it? Perfection can be found in the imperfect moments...so hang in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nradicalunschooling. blogspot. com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40123,"nextTopicId":10161}}
