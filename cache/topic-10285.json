That&#39;s not a bad thing. It takes processing to get Olive oil<br/>\n&gt; or butter or any other pure fat. That in itself does not make<br/>\n&gt; something less healthy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ****Well there are exceptions to everything. Ya got me there! :o) I guess I <br/>\n&gt; should have clarified that a bit more. Obviously, to eat butter and olive <br/>\n&gt; oil, you have to eat something that has been &quot;processed.&quot; You can also buy olive <br/>\n&gt; oil & butter with pesticides and, etc., OR you can buy organic olive oil & <br/>\n&gt; butter. I was meaning for example, say, farina, (and oatmeal too) you can buy <br/>\n&gt; certain brands and they will say their ingredients are just plain 100% farina <br/>\n&gt; or oatmeal but the way that it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; can (maybe not always, but can) <br/>\n&gt; leave little to nutrition along with the fact that it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; with <br/>\n&gt; pesticides as opposed to &quot;processed&quot; organically.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  just joined a local hs&#39;s food co-op recently and I was happy to see when <br/>\n&gt; I ordered some farina the label said &quot;.....Organic and is complete in every <br/>\n&gt; respect. It contains all the wheat germ with it&#39;s precious oil, all the fiber <br/>\n&gt; from the outer bran layer of the wheat and all the protein from the inner <br/>\n&gt; endosperm.&quot; There are other brands that, with their processing, may end up <br/>\n&gt; stripping the wheat germ of a lot of those nutrients.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>   We are also lucky enough to live near an old mill (built back in the late <br/>\n1800s, SO        cool) that a local family bought a few yrs. back, got it up <br/>\nand running again and farms all organic, grinds and sells it&#39;s own flours, <br/>\noatmeal, herbs, legumes, meat, etc. They also sell other local farmers organic <br/>\ngoods too. Talking to them about what goes on with the way that our food source <br/>\nis so over processed can be depressing.&lt;big sigh&gt; How sad it is.<br/>\nAlthough we have never made the kids eat anything they don&#39;t like, food has <br/>\nbeen a bit of an issue in our home with this wonderful unschooling lifestyle <br/>\nand I&#39;m trying to find some balance within it all, that is, without making too <br/>\nmuch of a big deal of it to my kids, which is not always easy! Kids catch on <br/>\nquick don&#39;t they! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10272,"nextTopicId":10259}}
