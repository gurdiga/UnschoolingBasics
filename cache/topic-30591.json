I <br/>\nliked the discussion on &quot;compromise&quot; not being good enough because <br/>\nsomeone is still losing and to look for win-win solutions, and that <br/>\nthey&#39;re always there even if we fail to find them in a given <br/>\nsituation.  I also liked the emphasis that it takes creativity to <br/>\nlive consensually and to find those win-win solutions.  It really <br/>\nsounded a lot like what I hear on these unschooling boards, so wanted <br/>\nto ask the opinion of some of our more thoughtful, experienced and <br/>\ndeveloped unschoolers...<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing some nefarious nuance? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie M<br/>\nJames 9.9.5<br/>\nTyler 6.8.7</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30490,"nextTopicId":30600}}
