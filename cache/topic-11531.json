If you have a life, it will be natural to <br/>\nbring bits of that life into the house. The kids may take some, may <br/>\nleave some, may head off into knights because they caught a bit of <br/>\nyou watching Sean Connery as King Arthur in First Knight. Or, they <br/>\nmay not. You are a *facilitater* - the same way you made safe spaces <br/>\nfor toddlers to toddle and cleared the yard for 4 yr olds to run <br/>\nfree, that&#39;s the same attitude as they get older - provide transport <br/>\nto the bookstore, art supply store, dojo, park, grocery store, dance <br/>\nstudio, wherever. Mention that you saw thus and such concert, movie, <br/>\nplay and thought they might be interested. Check out local papers <br/>\nfor soccer leagues or dance studios or fishing tournaments. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut it in another context: remember how it is when you start dating <br/>\nsomeone? you study that person - their likes, dislikes, passions, <br/>\netc. If you find that this other person loves the TransSiberian <br/>\nOrchestra and you notice that the group will be in the next town <br/>\nover for a concert, you mention it and see if yor sweetie would like <br/>\nto get tickets for it (or maybe arrange for the tickets as a <br/>\nsurprise). Same with your kids - become students of your kids - <br/>\ntheir likes, dislikes, passions, etc and find ways to help them in <br/>\nthose pursuits. And bring your own interests to the table too - we <br/>\nhave gotten National Geographic for almost the entire 12 1/2 years <br/>\nwe&#39;ve been married because DH likes it. When DS was about 2 1/2 he <br/>\nfound a map of Antarctica that came out of the magazine and was <br/>\nenthralled - he carried that map around, practically slept with it, <br/>\nfor days, asking questions about things and drinking it all in. He&#39;s <br/>\nnow almost 8 and he still loves maps and globes and finding places. <br/>\nFor a while, his idea of a great game was for me to name a country <br/>\nand he had to find it on a flat world map. Then he&#39;d name a place <br/>\nand I had to find it. He knew some of the larger/most recognizable <br/>\nplaces (such as China, Russia, Canada, US, Brazil, Antarctica, <br/>\nAustralia) by location and shape before he could really read. At the <br/>\nlast summer Olympics, he got intrigued by one particular team and <br/>\nlooked up where that country was on the globe. We never -intended- <br/>\nthat the magazine or watching the Olympics be a &#39;teaching tool&#39; - <br/>\nthose are just parts of our lives that we bring into the house. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Intro/concerns (LONG!)","postDate":"1144756685","msgId":11581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODJCNzY1MzY0OERGOS0xODQwLTI4MEBtYmxrLXI0My5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxZjcwYys2ODEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11571,"nextInTopic":11589,"prevInTime":11580,"nextInTime":11582,"topicId":11531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I keep thinking this is not for me and that maybe I am the &quot;relaxed ecclectic&quot; type, but then I find myself continuing to read and learn (sort of the attracted and repulsed feeling -- and I don&#39;t mean repulsed in a nauseated way, just in a push-pull way).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI have typical (from what I&#39;ve read) concerns about screen controls (TV, videogame, computer) and food controls.  My children are very young (3, 1 and in utero :) and so it isn&#39;t a huge issue yet, but this is primarily due to lack of exposure (which goes a bit against one of the interesting discussions I read about a &quot;big life&quot; at AlwaysUnschooled).  My daughter (3) went to preschool temporarily (yuck).<br/>\n <br/>\nThis email might be too unorganized and stream-of consciousness, but maybe it will resonate with others who went through (or are going through) these feelings on their journey.  Anyway, I read some of the typical days of unschoolers and the thought of sitting around watching TV all day or playing video games all day just freaks me out.  I know this isn&#39;t always the case, but it is the case on the majority of the &quot;what unschooling looks like at our house today&quot; posts I have read look like.  I have gone through this in my head repeatedly.  Why does it bother me?  Would it bother me if they were reading or doing math problems?  Yes.  A largely sedentary lifestyle would bother me.  And something about the idea that teachers and parents shouldn&#39;t teach, but that TV and videogames should (or be learned from) seems odd to me -- although I totally get (and passionately) the reasoning behind avoiding institutionalized school.  I realize some of these are &quot;my&quot; issues...I just don&#39;t<br/>\n enjoy sitting around much at all, not a big TV person, sports fan, etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLikewise, on the food controls, again, not really an issue for us in our rather organic, vegetarian household (also breastfeeding) thus far since the kids are young (I do not restrict at parties, etc., but have explained why I don&#39;t eat meat to the older one), but I could see it becoming an issue very easily.  I know one friend who is leaning toward unschooling and her daughter has no limits on anything unless it directly impacts safety (e.g. car seat) and at 3-1/2 she is significantly overweight, has 2 cavities, and basically watches reruns of princess movies for 10 hours a day.  Her mom can barely get her to go to the park (and does not force her).  Now, maybe the weight and cavities are genetic, but I can&#39;t help but think it might have a bit to do with all the cookies and candy and the utter lack of fruits, veggies, etc. in her diet.  And I agree, she might be learning tons from repeating princess movies.  Who knows?  Still, anecdotally, we can all say, well &quot;Uncle Joe<br/>\n smoked, drank, and never ate a vegetable and lived to 102!&quot;, but I am fairly convinced that, except for a few lucky, genetically blessed individuals, diet and lifestyle play a strong role in one&#39;s health.  With my friend&#39;s little girl, I also think that her diet might be causing her to be low energy, etc.  All of this, of course, makes mom&#39;s life easier in some ways, because her daughter will literally sit there all day, has few tantrums, etc., but I am honestly happier that my daughter does lots of other things and eats a healthy, varied diet, even though that means we have some &quot;rules.&quot;  Anyway, we all have anectdotal examples of someone who does this or doesn&#39;t do that, but those don&#39;t convince me (and I can poke all sorts of holes into my own anectdotal story above!).  Research I&#39;ve read critically (as in looking at who did the study, biases, etc.) does influence me, I admit, and a lot of what I&#39;ve seen in research and in life has led me to the idea that very young<br/>\n children generally do not make healthy choices when given total freedom.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThese are my rules currently (will not be surprised or offended by attacks on these):<br/>\n <br/>\nFood:  5 colors on the plate at every meal (we make a game of it, and she counts and corrects me if there are only 4, etc.).  Try one bite of everything on your plate (because &quot;sometimes it takes our tummies and our tongues lots of tastes to learn to like something new,&quot; which she has always been fine with).  Kids do not have to finish their plates or anything like that.  We let our tummies tell us when we are hungry or full. There is a snack shelf in the fridge at her height full of snacks (all things she loves, but all pretty healthy) that she can access whenever she wants. We do not have the TV on during mealtimes.  On sweets, I&#39;m using a &quot;don&#39;t offer, don&#39;t refuse&quot; policy, but I will try to distract her sometimes at parties, etc., and I also explain to her why I eat the way I do.  So while she has freedom throughout the day, I realize this isn&#39;t true freedom, because our household is quite restricted compared to other households.  Also, she gets to help shop, but this<br/>\n is at Whole Foods, so again, quite restrictive and not really total freedom.<br/>\n <br/>\nTV/computer: She has 1/2 hour magnets (like money) with an &quot;allowance&quot; (not attached to rewards or punishments) of screen time per week (currently 8 hours) that she &quot;spends&quot; on TV and sometimes the computer. She can spend them however she wants, but has only been exposed to certain shows thus far, so only requests those.  Pretty much most shows she is interested in right now would be considered &quot;educational,&quot; but that is just the trend right now in the media directed towards little ones.  She does watch a few things that aren&#39;t specifically categorized as educational (e.g. Cinderella) as well. We have always put movies on in different languages for fun (French and Spanish), so she watches in whichever of 3 languages she is in the mood for.  She watches the most TV in the house (I watch 2-3 hours a week, hubby even less, my 1yo watches almost none).<br/>\n <br/>\nWe spend a lot of time outdoors and she goes to classes for things she is interested in (Expressercise which is a ballet/creative movement thing), swimming, etc.  I started my 3yo in some stuff before she was too little to really show an &quot;interest&quot;, just for fun, and some she has continued and others not.  My 1yo goes to swimming (both love water and baths) and a sibling gymnastics class (fun for the 3 of us).  Again, not really totally unschooling, because these are more directed by me than by them (I don&#39;t think my 1 yo would have said, &quot;hey Mom, let&#39;s go swimming!&quot;  LOL).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI am happy with the choices I have made (although constantly examining them and the reasons for them because I know I am not perfect).  I honestly have one of the only 3yos I know who eats such a varied diet and requests veggies randomly. She also does not ask for extra TV time...just when it is done, it is done.  I do not think without the &quot;rule&quot; she would have tried many of these foods because, like most toddlers, she gravitated toward beige foods (I know so many kids who only eat beige J foods, I cannot even count LOL).  I also think the screen time &quot;rules&quot; have helped me stay creative, because I don&#39;t have that crutch to fall back on (not that others use it as a crutch...just saying for me personally, it would make life A LOT easier if we sat together and watched TV a lot more than we do -- physically, monetarily, and in creative expenditures LOL).   <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, these things go against the unschooling philosophy, I know, and I&#39;m not entirely sure if that is something I can (or choose) to fix.  I believe strongly in parts (though I know as a philosophy the parts are inextricable), but not in other parts.  Therein lies my confusion.  If I do not subscribe to all of these things (and after all of the reading and searching the archives, still have not been swayed on the food and screen time issues), does this mean I am a &quot;relaxed eclectic&quot; homeschooler and not quite an unschooler, or is there an unschooler group that uses some limits, etc.?<br/>\n <br/>\nAlthough this might seem like a lot of topics in one, really, the question is one:  Where do I fit if I don&#39;t believe in school (at home or in an institution), but I do believe in some limits and education about food, television, etc.? <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for your thoughts and input!<br/>\n <br/>\nChriste<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s.  I have looked for eclectic lists, but could not find anything (just some local groups -- but not my locality, and some religious groups that did not jive with my beliefs).  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11587,"nextTopicId":11511}}
