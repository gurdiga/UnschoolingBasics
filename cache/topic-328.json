It doesn&#39;t usually happen that<br/>\nthey pick up a book for the first time, look at the words and the next<br/>\ntime they pick up a book they can read.  Reading is a process.  Each kid<br/>\nmakes sense of the words in their own time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when we&#39;re thinking of natural learning and the ways it spills over<br/>\ninto other parts of our lives, we should remember there is a process for<br/>\neverything.  Every kid will make sense of things in their own time.   If<br/>\nwe&#39;re going to accept kids will gradually acquire reading skills, if<br/>\nthey&#39;re read to and see other&#39;s reading,  then it&#39;s easier to accept kids<br/>\nwill gradually acquire cleaning up skills if people clean up for them and<br/>\nthey see people cleaning up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it.  My son does most of his own laundry.  He even has to get a<br/>\nstool to stand on so he can reach into the washer to take stuff out, so<br/>\nit&#39;s not the easiest thing for him to do, but he does it.  I never<br/>\nrequired him to do laundry and I don&#39;t ever remember even asking him to. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll clean up hair balls if the cat spews.  He takes the garbage out<br/>\nwhen he sees it&#39;s full.  He sometimes does dishes.   But none of that<br/>\nhappened all at once.  He didn&#39;t just wake up one day and know how to do<br/>\nthose things and have a desire to do them.  He lived with people who did<br/>\nthem because it made everyone&#39;s life a little better and less frustrating<br/>\nwhen those things were taken care of.  He lived with people who did them<br/>\nhappily, (usually&lt;g&gt;) and who were happy to do things for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78615010,"authorName":"mamaaj2000","from":"&quot;mamaaj2000&quot; &lt;mamaaj2000@...&gt;","profile":"mamaaj2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Up to My Ears...","postDate":"1086628279","msgId":376,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNhMjdqbit2NmdlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5dXI5OCt0cXJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":374,"nextInTopic":378,"prevInTime":375,"nextInTime":377,"topicId":328,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa, A quick little idea: if bending over is the worst part, ask the kids to hand things to you when they are sitting on the floor.

How about, now that you&#39;re relaxing about<br/>\neating, you get rid of the dining room table and turn<br/>\nthat into a cool play room, with bright shelves and a<br/>\nTV, playstation, all that.  We did something similar a<br/>\nfew years ago--we have a small house, with three small<br/>\nbedrooms, and took one of the bedrooms, patched the<br/>\ndoorway that was in the hallway and cut a hole to it<br/>\nfrom the living room.  Then we put cool french doors<br/>\non it.  It has long, low shelves that offer for ease<br/>\nin cleaning, and I bought wicker baskets for $1 at<br/>\nwalmart and fill them with toys.  NOT to say that we<br/>\nmandate toys stay in that room or anything, but it is<br/>\na really cool room with no other furniture but toys<br/>\nand bean bag chairs, and a pop machine, and<br/>\ntv/vcr/tivo/playstation....so lots of playing does<br/>\nhappen there.

Other than that, there&#39;s laundry and dishes and<br/>\ngarbage and that stuff, but clutter gets de-cluttered<br/>\nand put where it belongs once a week, to start the<br/>\nmigration out again.  It helps a lot that most of the<br/>\ntoys are in the playroom, and that there&#39;s a door<br/>\nthere in case of guests (who am I kidding--no one ever<br/>\nvisits :( but other than a weekly pick up we would<br/>\nrather spend time living than cleaning...<br/>\n<br/>\nDana<br/>\nin Montana<br/>\n<br/>\n--- melissazietlow &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Zietlowfamily@...\">Zietlowfamily@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello All,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Glad to report that although I still feel some<br/>\n&gt; uneasiness, I have <br/>\n&gt; loosed my grip on the food issue.  My dds are doing<br/>\n&gt; well and are <br/>\n&gt; happy having more freedom.  They seem to be slowing<br/>\n&gt; down a little <br/>\n&gt; with the binging and begging, etc. as the novelty is<br/>\n&gt; wearing off. <br/>\n&gt; Joyce, thanks for you response to aj concerning<br/>\n&gt; sitting at the table <br/>\n&gt; for dinner.  This has also been an issue for us<br/>\n&gt; (especially dh) and <br/>\n&gt; your post helps.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So here goes with the NEXT issue...  It has been<br/>\n&gt; suggested to me that <br/>\n&gt; forcing children to clean up after themselves is not<br/>\n&gt; respectful or <br/>\n&gt; healthy, and that having toys, etc. picked up is a<br/>\n&gt; parent&#39;s issue. <br/>\n&gt; For some time, we have imposed clean up time once or<br/>\n&gt; twice a day and <br/>\n&gt; required the girls (3 & 5yo now) to put away toys in<br/>\n&gt; the living room <br/>\n&gt; and throughout the house.  Of course, they have<br/>\n&gt; never wanted to do so <br/>\n&gt; at any time, and in the past we have used punishment<br/>\n&gt; as an <br/>\n&gt; &#39;incentive&#39; but have decided, after seriously<br/>\n&gt; questioning our <br/>\n&gt; lifestyle that we don&#39;t want to coerce this any more<br/>\n&gt; either.    <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our house is very small and our humble livingroom is<br/>\n&gt; the only place <br/>\n&gt; toys can be kept. So it gets out of control to the<br/>\n&gt; point that I <br/>\n&gt; cannot stand the clutter/lack of floor and sitting<br/>\n&gt; space.  If left <br/>\n&gt; unchecked, it spills over into the kitchen and<br/>\n&gt; diningroom and starts <br/>\n&gt; to choke out the entire house.  At times before we<br/>\n&gt; would help the <br/>\n&gt; kids clean up, and try to make the chore a game by<br/>\n&gt; singing songs, <br/>\n&gt; etc.  Now and then we would get good results, but<br/>\n&gt; usually ended up <br/>\n&gt; with two frustrated or angry parents who did most of<br/>\n&gt; the work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point, we want good relationships with dds,<br/>\n&gt; and are seeing <br/>\n&gt; that perhaps cleaning should be up to us, as we did<br/>\n&gt; choose to have <br/>\n&gt; children and provide them with the toys. And a tidy<br/>\n&gt; home (key word: <br/>\n&gt; tidy, NOT perfect)is just not a priority that the<br/>\n&gt; kids (and not <br/>\n&gt; really to dh, sigh) can understand yet. We have<br/>\n&gt; stopped making it a <br/>\n&gt; daily requirement (and I have been trying to let the<br/>\n&gt; mess bother me <br/>\n&gt; less) and have been saying, &quot;I would like to get<br/>\n&gt; these toys put away <br/>\n&gt; today&quot; instead of &quot;time for you to clean up&quot;. Then<br/>\n&gt; one or both of us <br/>\n&gt; does the job and casually asks the kids for help. <br/>\n&gt; When they refuse <br/>\n&gt; (act deaf) we have been trying to let this go,<br/>\n&gt; BUT...I (more so than <br/>\n&gt; dh) still feel, deep down, anger and resentment at<br/>\n&gt; times when I <br/>\n&gt; am &#39;stuck&#39; cleaning up after them while they sit and<br/>\n&gt; watch or go <br/>\n&gt; merrily on their way. Hmmm...is this how they felt<br/>\n&gt; when I made them <br/>\n&gt; do it alone?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have been feeling selfish - it really upsets me<br/>\n&gt; that I do so much <br/>\n&gt; for the family and no one (not even dh, really, but<br/>\n&gt; he tries to keep <br/>\n&gt; the peace)wants to help me take care of things that<br/>\n&gt; are important to <br/>\n&gt; me now and then. I have been controlling in the<br/>\n&gt; past, so perhaps that <br/>\n&gt; is part of the issue right now, but as we have<br/>\n&gt; relaxed our parenting <br/>\n&gt; over the last few months, I wonder is anyone<br/>\n&gt; appreciative at <br/>\n&gt; all?  I am almost 9 months pregnant and cannot<br/>\n&gt; physically keep up <br/>\n&gt; with all that I usually do.  I have been skimming<br/>\n&gt; the surface and <br/>\n&gt; leaving the toys, but after several days, it needs<br/>\n&gt; an overhaul so we <br/>\n&gt; can utilize the house comfortably!  I just wanted to<br/>\n&gt; cry today as I <br/>\n&gt; was bending over (difficult task) doing it myself<br/>\n&gt; again before <br/>\n&gt; company came.  It didn&#39;t bother anyone else but me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Help me see the light?  Or get my head out of the<br/>\n&gt; sand (or at least <br/>\n&gt; above water)?

Or do I just need a hormone adjustment?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Melissa,<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel for where you are at!  I have been through a lot of the mental<br/>\nwondering about cleanup that you are pondering here (without even being all<br/>\nhormonal and the whole bending thing!) and have gotten to a better place<br/>\nsomewhat over time, so I&#39;d be happy to share my own thoughts in the event<br/>\nthey are helpful.  FYI my kids are 5 and 3.  I also have a small house and<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t take much time before I am getting grumpy tripping over toys and<br/>\nthere&#39;s no room left to set up the next project.  I have definitely<br/>\nidentified a need in myself for a certain amount of tidiness and have tried<br/>\nto honor that as well as the needs for my kids to play and learn and<br/>\nexperiment all of which equal greater clutter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never had much luck and not spent much time on forcing or punishment<br/>\ntype things for cleanup.  My husband sometimes tries it and it never works.<br/>\nWhen my daughter was younger she was very amenable to me making it more of a<br/>\ngame (sing the Barney song or ask &quot;What color do you want to pick up?  You<br/>\nwant red?  Okay, I&#39;ll clean up yellow... or alternately it&#39;s more fun to<br/>\npick up certain things if you get to &quot;throw&quot; them in the appropriate<br/>\ncontainer) so we did a lot of that.  My son doesn&#39;t respond so much to that.<br/>\nWhere we are at now is that I&#39;m probably less bothered by the clutter than I<br/>\nused to be, but also I&#39;ve discussed with my children how clutter makes me<br/>\nfeel and my needs around it and we&#39;ve found some things that work.  I find<br/>\ndiscussion with them at an age appropriate levels about my needs and<br/>\nfeelings a big key to both helping me move to a better place and also<br/>\nenlisting their help in just about all areas where here we are trying to<br/>\ntogether with different needs and tolerances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo these days to enlist their help cleaning up I have a few things.<br/>\nSometimes I go with &quot;Okay, to start this next project you want, I think we<br/>\nneed to make some space by cleaning up the last few things you guys did.<br/>\nI&#39;m ready to help you set up the next thing when we get all of that cleaned<br/>\nup&quot; and that works a lot ... we all pitch in together to clean it.<br/>\nSometimes I just go with &quot;Okay, it&#39;s getting late in the day and we have a<br/>\nlot of old projects not cleaned up yet.  Mom&#39;s tripping over things.  You<br/>\nguys are asking for more toys to come out from the closet.  I like to help<br/>\nyou with the things you want, and I need you to help me now get the clutter<br/>\npicked up which is something mama wants&quot;.  They are really responsive to<br/>\nthat for the most part.  I see it as getting cooperation that enables all of<br/>\nus to live together peacefully in the same space.  I help them with what<br/>\nthey want and let them know that I expect they will help me.  It is seldom<br/>\nthat they will choose not to do the next project to avoid cleaning up.  I<br/>\nstill clean up quite a bit after my 3 year old because he is after all 3 and<br/>\nhis capabilities of making a mess far exceed his clean up capabilities, but<br/>\nit&#39;s important to me that he pitch in and make an effort - if I see him<br/>\nhelping I find that even if I&#39;m doing a lot of it, I&#39;m not so angry and<br/>\ncranky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as long as I see them willing to help and take some responsibility for<br/>\ntheir messes I find that I can handle the new messes with more equanimity<br/>\ninstead of a long held inside repressed sigh.  I find it funny that as I<br/>\nwrite this my daughter, son and niece have taken every book off our three<br/>\nshelf bookshelf of kids books, stewn them on the floor and are having fun<br/>\nwith them - my son mostly walking over the piles, my daughter and niece<br/>\nactually looking at what they find.  It&#39;s a huge mess, but I didn&#39;t blink an<br/>\neye when they made it because I know I will have some cooperation at some<br/>\npoint cleaning it up so I can enjoy the bonding with all those books they<br/>\nare having without inwardly seething that I&#39;ll have to clean it all up<br/>\nmyself.  So my suggestion is talk to them about how you feel and try some<br/>\ndifferent ways of enlisting their cooperation and see what works for all of<br/>\nyou.  I think it&#39;s important to honor your own feelings and your children&#39;s<br/>\nas well about how they like to be treated (not many of us like to be<br/>\ndictated to, but most of us are more than willing to help if we are part of<br/>\na team) so you can all live together in harmony.  It&#39;s not a &quot;parent<br/>\nproblem&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;family issue&quot; in my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":159596184,"authorName":"melissazietlow","from":"&quot;melissazietlow&quot; &lt;Zietlowfamily@...&gt;","profile":"melissazietlow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Up to My Ears...","postDate":"1086517352","msgId":328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5dXI5OCt0cXJtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":350,"prevInTime":327,"nextInTime":329,"topicId":328,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All, Glad to report that although I still feel some uneasiness, I have loosed my grip on the food issue.

My dds are doing well and are <br/>\nhappy having more freedom.  They seem to be slowing down a little <br/>\nwith the binging and begging, etc. as the novelty is wearing off. <br/>\nJoyce, thanks for you response to aj concerning sitting at the table <br/>\nfor dinner.  This has also been an issue for us (especially dh) and <br/>\nyour post helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here goes with the NEXT issue...  It has been suggested to me that <br/>\nforcing children to clean up after themselves is not respectful or <br/>\nhealthy, and that having toys, etc. picked up is a parent&#39;s issue. <br/>\nFor some time, we have imposed clean up time once or twice a day and <br/>\nrequired the girls (3 & 5yo now) to put away toys in the living room <br/>\nand throughout the house.  Of course, they have never wanted to do so <br/>\nat any time, and in the past we have used punishment as an <br/>\n&#39;incentive&#39; but have decided, after seriously questioning our <br/>\nlifestyle that we don&#39;t want to coerce this any more either.    <br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is very small and our humble livingroom is the only place <br/>\ntoys can be kept. So it gets out of control to the point that I <br/>\ncannot stand the clutter/lack of floor and sitting space.  If left <br/>\nunchecked, it spills over into the kitchen and diningroom and starts <br/>\nto choke out the entire house.  At times before we would help the <br/>\nkids clean up, and try to make the chore a game by singing songs, <br/>\netc.  Now and then we would get good results, but usually ended up <br/>\nwith two frustrated or angry parents who did most of the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, we want good relationships with dds, and are seeing <br/>\nthat perhaps cleaning should be up to us, as we did choose to have <br/>\nchildren and provide them with the toys. And a tidy home (key word: <br/>\ntidy, NOT perfect)is just not a priority that the kids (and not <br/>\nreally to dh, sigh) can understand yet. We have stopped making it a <br/>\ndaily requirement (and I have been trying to let the mess bother me <br/>\nless) and have been saying, &quot;I would like to get these toys put away <br/>\ntoday&quot; instead of &quot;time for you to clean up&quot;. Then one or both of us <br/>\ndoes the job and casually asks the kids for help.  When they refuse <br/>\n(act deaf) we have been trying to let this go, BUT...I (more so than <br/>\ndh) still feel, deep down, anger and resentment at times when I <br/>\nam &#39;stuck&#39; cleaning up after them while they sit and watch or go <br/>\nmerrily on their way. Hmmm...is this how they felt when I made them <br/>\ndo it alone?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling selfish - it really upsets me that I do so much <br/>\nfor the family and no one (not even dh, really, but he tries to keep <br/>\nthe peace)wants to help me take care of things that are important to <br/>\nme now and then. I have been controlling in the past, so perhaps that <br/>\nis part of the issue right now, but as we have relaxed our parenting <br/>\nover the last few months, I wonder is anyone appreciative at <br/>\nall?  I am almost 9 months pregnant and cannot physically keep up <br/>\nwith all that I usually do.  I have been skimming the surface and <br/>\nleaving the toys, but after several days, it needs an overhaul so we <br/>\ncan utilize the house comfortably!  I just wanted to cry today as I <br/>\nwas bending over (difficult task) doing it myself again before <br/>\ncompany came.  It didn&#39;t bother anyone else but me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me see the light?  Or get my head out of the sand (or at least <br/>\nabove water)?  Or do I just need a hormone adjustment?<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":345,"nextTopicId":147}}
