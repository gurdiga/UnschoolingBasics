I knew her well <br/>\nenough to know that every decision she made would be right for her <br/>\nat that time or she&#39;d merge into a new path if it wasn&#39;t. I really <br/>\nhad no expectations, other than for her to be happy. When she <br/>\nstarted fretting in her late teens about what she was going to do <br/>\nwith the rest of her life, I explained to her that the restlessness <br/>\nshe was feeling was her body/mind/soul becoming aware of the need <br/>\nfor a change and b/m/s were all searching for what exactly that <br/>\nchange would be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never had the nagging doubts. I loved it when her mind would hear <br/>\na new idea (to her) and she&#39;d immerse herself in learning about it. <br/>\nShe&#39;d know right where she stood on the idea and just how much of <br/>\nthe idea to adopt for herself. She often took it further than it had <br/>\nbeen taken and get really involved. Hence her title as the Resident <br/>\nRadical at college. She was on the news picketing places more than a <br/>\nfew times. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI took her decisions about what &quot;to do&quot; with her life seriously and <br/>\nsupported her in those decisions. Sometimes she stuck with them for <br/>\nawhile and at other times she decided rather quickly that it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsuch a great choice for her. She always discusses her plans with me <br/>\nand she always gets my support. That way she feels free to drop them <br/>\nand not worry about mom getting all weird about it. She&#39;s watched me <br/>\nchange paths several times during her lifetime and she knows that <br/>\nthere are many paths to choose from that will be right for her at <br/>\ndifferent times in her life. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not content to stay in one place in my life for very long. I go <br/>\nfrom one thing to the other, quitting when it&#39;s not right for me and <br/>\ngoing on to something else...with no apologies. I enjoy my life and <br/>\nI feel no guilt about not finishing the pottery class (for instance) <br/>\nwhen it made my wrists hurt. My parents have belittled my choices as <br/>\nfar back as I can remember. I made a vow to never do that to Laurie. <br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170364620,"authorName":"we3deeves@aol.com","from":"we3deeves@...","profile":"emmasmama99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] College & Peter Kowalski","postDate":"1092415579","msgId":2757,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRkLjExYzIxNzg1LjJlNGU0YTViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2768,"prevInTime":2756,"nextInTime":2758,"topicId":2757,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 8/13/2004 12:09:09 AM Central Standard Time, ... where going to college is considered an affront to unschooling.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-624324715\">In a message dated 8/13/2004 12:09:09 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But I don&#39;t like to see someone create (even inadvertently) a &quot;culture&quot; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>where going to college is considered an affront to unschooling.&lt;<br/>\nOh, I don&#39;t know.
