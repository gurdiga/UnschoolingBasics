Militant isn&#39;t  <br/>\na part of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd does advise people to firmly tell a child no when the  <br/>\nchild is doing something hurtful or destructive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the hard part of explaining radical unschooling, though. A  <br/>\nmindful parent can tell a child no and the child understands it&#39;s a  <br/>\nbig &quot;Whoa, wait a minute, look at what you&#39;re doing.&quot; A conventional  <br/>\nparent can do the same and it&#39;s ropes and chains and a lock on the  <br/>\ncage and something for the child to find a way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a child can&#39;t understand no as help and information if they hear  <br/>\nit a lot. For radical unschoolers it&#39;s reserved for extreme situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWay back in the AOL days when the conservative homeschoolers rubbed  <br/>\nup against the unschoolers in the forums, I remember plenty of moms  <br/>\nsaying they made sure their kids heard no a lot and were punished if  <br/>\ntheir kids didn&#39;t obey so their kids would understand the meaning of  <br/>\nno. What if they were to run into the street? they argued. They need  <br/>\nto stop when they hear no.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flaw is that a lot of nos and kids learn to tune them out. When  <br/>\nkids rarely hear no, &quot;NO!&quot; is a big shock and it means something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really helps to ask if something is confusing you! :-) It helps  <br/>\n*us* too because it points out where the explanations aren&#39;t quite  <br/>\ncutting it and need clarified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the hardest part of explaining radical unschooling is that  <br/>\npeople arrive with a lot of baggage about how to treat children. And  <br/>\na lot of the ideas we want to get across are already claimed by  <br/>\nconventional parenting and schooling but mean something totally  <br/>\ndifferent.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you can say no. But the less you say no, the more you say &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>\nfind a better way to do that,&quot; the more effective the nos will be.  <br/>\nKids should hear no as good advice not as control. The first problem  <br/>\nis that conventional parents are certain their nos *are* good advice.  <br/>\nThe second problem is that their kids *don&#39;t* think their nos are  <br/>\ngood advice! In order to get to the point where a parent can  <br/>\nmindfully say no a lot of garbage needs cleared out of the way first.  <br/>\nAnd it&#39;s a lot easier if the parent begins by dropping no and saying  <br/>\nyes so they can regain their children&#39;s trust. But, then that can go  <br/>\ntoo far with kids who feel out of control and parents who don&#39;t know  <br/>\nwhat to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":34323,"authorName":"da Slinky","from":"da Slinky &lt;lady_slinky@...&gt;","profile":"ladyslinky","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What unschooling is","postDate":"1231544799","msgId":37733,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0ODg0MC44MTE1NC5xbUB3ZWI1MjcwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkyNGM0ZDBhMDkwMTAzMDgzNnczZGNmNzNlZHg3NjdjYjM4NzFhYmY0MjFhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8ODg2MzA4LjU3NDIwLnFtQHdlYjUyNzA0Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDhDQjNFRUExN0YwMUJEQS1GNTgtMUVDQHdlYm1haWwtZGQxNy5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37738,"prevInTime":37732,"nextInTime":37734,"topicId":37733,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Don t get me wrong I am not saying they are wrong.
