(My <br/>\nguess is that he doesn&#39;t shame *just* the kids---that this is his MO in <br/>\ndealing with everyone.) Talk about how *he* must have been shamed as a <br/>\nboy and how *he* must&#39;ve felt as a little one---both to him and to the <br/>\nchildren. Be compassionate---know that he hurt too.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Help him not do it again. By being a buffer whenever possible. By <br/>\nbeing the change you want to see. By modeling the way you want both of <br/>\nyou to deal with the kids. By pointing out when what he does better IS <br/>\nworking. And as Meredith says (way better than I can): praise his <br/>\nefforts---no matter how puny---and even if he&#39;s not doing much of <br/>\nanything different. &lt;g&gt; Meredith, how DO you put this so well?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said (or written &lt;g&gt;)---it&#39;s still something *he* has to <br/>\nchange. *You* can&#39;t change him---only *he* can do that. But you can <br/>\nhelp give him tools if he&#39;s willing to accept them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaisha, does Jabari read here? Do you share things like this with him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know he&#39;s made some headway recently. Why is that? What&#39;s changed? <br/>\nCould you take the above, print it out, and tape it to the bathroom <br/>\nmirror? Would he be offended?
