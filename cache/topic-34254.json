My husband LOVES it there<br/>\nand has been there many times, but I have never been out west- only<br/>\ntraveled north and south.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there an unschooling community in that area? What else can anyone<br/>\ntell me about the area-positive and negative?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to e-mail me off list.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!
