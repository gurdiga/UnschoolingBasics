We  visited  an old schoolhouse at a little museum and  when they saw the strap on the desk   I told them about the times I was strapped in school (55 years ago).<br/>\nThe next time their friends were over they all got excited about having me be the school teacher and giving them work on the blackboard and then wanting me to get mad and give them the strap.<br/>\nThey thought it was exciting-I thought this was so weird. i said I was  sorry but i wouldnt feel right about playing that -they were complaining but soon went on to something   &quot;more funner&quot; as they say.<br/>\nI had started out homeschooling  the girls  in a fairly structured &quot;you have to do some of this  before you can play&quot; mode  and losing my temper on occasion before we morphed into unschooling.<br/>\nObviously this request pushed a lot of buttons for me. anyway I was the one who got the strap more than once so  it was a little more close to home LOL<br/>\ngrace<br/>\n  ----------<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.308 / Virus Database: 266.7.2 - Release Date: 3/11/05<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5017,"nextTopicId":5036}}
