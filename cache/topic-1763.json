Start by finding a &quot;home&quot; for everything new that <br/>\nyou bring into the house. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, try doing these things every day--<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Go through your mail and throw away the &quot;trash&quot; mail and find <br/>\na &quot;home&quot; for the bills to live in while they are waiting to be paid.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Do your dishes and clean your kitchen counters every night before <br/>\nbed. <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Every morning collect all the dirty laundry from the house and <br/>\ntake it to the laundry room. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Do two loads of laundry every day...from start to finish (put <br/>\naway those 2 loads). <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Pick one area to work on and just spend 15 minutes (at least once <br/>\na day) sorting through things--either find a new home for it, put it <br/>\nin a box labeled &quot;keep&quot;, or throw it away. Give it time too. It <br/>\ntook a lot longer than one day for it to get messy...so it&#39;s going to <br/>\ntake time to get it where you want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Saturdays you could take your &quot;keep&quot; box and find a new home for <br/>\neverything you put in it that week.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry visiting www.flylady.net and look through her suggestions.

After a few years of &quot;flywashing&quot;<br/>\n(her term for brainwashing), my attitude has changed.  I never really<br/>\nhated tidying up, but... I disliked it enough to rarely get around to<br/>\ndoing it.  I never really did her routine exactly, but I did get a few<br/>\ngood habits ingrained permanently in my head, and most-importantly I<br/>\ngot a big attitude adjustment.  She constantly refers to cleaning as<br/>\n&quot;blessing the house.&quot;  And after hearing that a few thousand times,<br/>\nthat&#39;s how I feel about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, it&#39;s possible to undo the attitude passed down to the<br/>\nchildren... just be patient.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, despite me having a good attitude toward &quot;blessing&quot; for<br/>\nmost of my dd&#39;s life, she is COMPLETELY oblivious to messes.  She<br/>\ninherited her dad&#39;s... um... lack of concern.  I&#39;m finally accepting<br/>\nthat.  My ds loves helping me clean, though, which just goes to show<br/>\nthat everyone is different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really did help me to realize that *I* am the one in this household<br/>\nwho desperately needs things put away.  I get really cranky when the<br/>\nfloor is filling up with toys and cat fuzz.  But no one else does.<br/>\nJust me.  So I clean it up and then I feel better.  On the other hand,<br/>\ndespite my dust mite allergy, dusty surfaces don&#39;t bother me at all.<br/>\nI&#39;ve been known to go 6 months between dustings.  Just my little<br/>\noddity.  No one else in the house cares about dust, so... no one ends<br/>\nup cleaning it.  LOL  And, to just keep rambling... the main reason I<br/>\nhate dusting is because of our clutter level.  We&#39;re not too bad, but<br/>\ndefinitely have that &quot;lived in&quot; look, and every single horizontal<br/>\nsurface is full of stuff.  I am not going to spend the time to take<br/>\nevery single thing off.  I would LOVE to declutter some more, but that<br/>\nbutts up against my husband&#39;s genetic need to never get rid of<br/>\nanything ever.  Soooo... no dusting.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just really can&#39;t recommend Flylady enough.  She understands clutter<br/>\nthat takes over the entire house, literally.  She&#39;s lived it.

But with &quot;organizing&quot; the trick is to do the underlying stuff  <br/>\nfirst (i.e., clear off the top shelf in the closet) to make space for  <br/>\nthe rest and, again, never expect to feel done.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 1, 2008, at 2:21 PM, ladyslinky wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So I am at a huge loss here.

They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; 13 yrs, 12 yrs and 2 mos. I don&#39;t expect the 2 month old to do<br/>\n&gt; anything except be cute and make more work (diapers, laundry).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The hardest thing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; swallow is the idea that I might have been making those demands or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; rules or restrictions for no other real reason than that they made<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things more convenient for me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is, of course, an element of that too for me and moreso for my<br/>\n&gt; husband. But dh gets a little &quot;nutso&quot; in a messy-house situation, and<br/>\n&gt; as I mentioned before he hasn&#39;t the time to make it the way he wants<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Personally, I can tolerate more of a mess than he, but I have issues<br/>\n&gt; with the kitchen and bathroom being a mess. The trouble is, I am<br/>\n&gt; clinically depressed (Major Depression, diagnosed & treated,<br/>\n&gt; hereditary), and that shows up mostly in the physical for me. I just<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t have the energy and it&#39;s not about changing my attitude. I can<br/>\n&gt; change my attitude until I&#39;m blue in the face but that doesn&#39;t change<br/>\n&gt; the fact that my body is just not on board with doing a lot of things<br/>\n&gt; - and I already do a lot for someone with my limitations. I have had<br/>\n&gt; to find coping mechanisms that really work for me, those things are<br/>\n&gt; gardening, bird-watching, cooking/baking, and knitting & crocheting.<br/>\n&gt; And it&#39;s not as though I don&#39;t set about doing chores myself. I<br/>\n&gt; voluntarily go about laundry day(s), daily washing of diapers, picking<br/>\n&gt; up after the kids and dh, mending clothes and costumes, knitting or<br/>\n&gt; crocheting wearable items for the family, making nice meals for the<br/>\n&gt; family, and so on rather joyfully, oftentimes singing while I do them.<br/>\n&gt; The kids see this. Do they join in or follow along? No.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; OTOH, my dd does clean her own room periodically of her own volition,<br/>\n&gt; and she cares for her snake in a way that makes me think she&#39;ll be an<br/>\n&gt; excellent, doting mother one day if she chooses. And so I know she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; picking something good up from me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My older ds, however, (and  he&#39;s 12), will leave things to go until,<br/>\n&gt; for example, his room was so messy the cats had been using it as a<br/>\n&gt; litter box. He finally cleaned his room to get rid of the smell, only<br/>\n&gt; the smell had set in he let it go so long. He has to be reminded - and<br/>\n&gt; I hate that I feel compelled to do this - to take a shower, for<br/>\n&gt; another example. I love him to pieces, but i don&#39;t want to be<br/>\n&gt; physically near him if his body odor is repulsive. Hygiene is another<br/>\n&gt; important topic to me, but that&#39;s probably another email for another<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I think the best way to get kids to help out around the house is to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not expect them to, ever. Never make it a battle. It would be best<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if it were a non issue from the very day they were born. Just keep<br/>\n&gt; &gt; cleaning up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...in a perfect world...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Butmost people start out in a much more mainstream place. So then,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; if they find their way to unschooling, they have to undo the damage<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that has already been done.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which is why I&#39;m asking. I don&#39;t really want to let this go as a<br/>\n&gt; damaging thing or as a forceful thing or as a battle or something by<br/>\n&gt; which the kids and I alienate ourselves one from the other. Would like<br/>\n&gt; to find an amenable solution!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; it. If you are really just looking to have a clean house but can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or don&#39;t want to do it yourself, hire someone to do it or change how<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you feel about having a clean house. Own it as being your issue.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t make it an issue for your children too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Someone else also suggested I might hire a maid. That&#39;s a great idea!<br/>\n&gt; But we can&#39;t afford one. :-( One of our cars just blew its head<br/>\n&gt; gaskets and it&#39;s not a repair we can afford, so we&#39;re down to one car<br/>\n&gt; and scrimping so as to save up for another second/family car. We&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; getting by in dh&#39;s economy commuting car for the next few months. Four<br/>\n&gt; adult sized people and a baby in a Mazda3. *blinkblink* ...not that a<br/>\n&gt; maid is an expense we can reasonably justify anyway. DH keeps the<br/>\n&gt; books, not me (thankgod!).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not tolerable for who? It must not be bothering them if they are<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, me, of course. I know full well this is my issue.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; leaving it that way. This is your issue. There are all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; things that would &quot;work&quot; to get your kids to clean up the kitchen or<br/>\n&gt; &gt; whatever. But they aren&#39;t going to support an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lifestyle. They aren&#39;t going to foster joy, love, and respect.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hmm... But y&#39;know, I don&#39;t go into their rooms and leave my dirty<br/>\n&gt; dishes, clothes and shoes laying about. I realize that I was<br/>\n&gt; originally talking about the common areas, but the analogy does apply<br/>\n&gt; to a degree.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Could your husband do a quick clean up of the kitchen before he goes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to bed if he is up late? Do you go to bed before your kids and then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they eat and make a mess, leaving it for you in the morning? Or are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is this accumulating over the day and you are wanting/expecting your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids to clean it all up?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; DH had been doing chores with them for a short while and he reported<br/>\n&gt; that it did work. His putting on TMBG and doing various household<br/>\n&gt; chores with the kids did seem effective. This was at night after I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; gone to bed. I&#39;m a morning person, the rest of the household members<br/>\n&gt; are night owls. He has since gotten behind with the financial end of<br/>\n&gt; keeping our house running and so has gone back to that to catch up.<br/>\n&gt; Meanwhile, I still go to bed around 9 with the baby, and the next<br/>\n&gt; morning  I find dirty dishes left around the living room and kitchen.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I cook and clean up after myself while I&#39;m cooking. They cook for<br/>\n&gt; themselves and leave the mess to sit. I&#39;m just not seeing the setting<br/>\n&gt; an example and showing respect working. I feel taken advantage of,<br/>\n&gt; like they know if they make a mess I&#39;m going to clean it up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; fun. It doesn&#39;t seem like something you enjoy either. Maybe if you<br/>\n&gt; &gt; changed your view of housework they would change theirs? That is<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Which view is that?

They hear me saying that they are free to<br/>\nsay no, but they see me struggling with it, and basically not really<br/>\nmeaning it yet.   It is an unschooling philosophy, IF I am<br/>\nunderstanding it correctly, that the NEED for a neat and tidy or clean<br/>\nhouse is the issue of the person that has that need. LOL I keep asking<br/>\nmyself, what kid would want to clean up all these overwhelming piles<br/>\nof toys, dishes, etc., if I can&#39;t even get up the willpower to do it?<br/>\n It doesn&#39;t keep me from falling into my familiar victim role of &quot;i<br/>\ncan&#39;t do it all by myself!&quot;  I even had a small epiphany a week or so<br/>\nago about how I really do feel awesome when I have a clean house, and<br/>\nso it would be worth it for me to just get over it and get it done. <br/>\nEverything becomes very black and white to me when I am in a<br/>\nvictim/panic/really-need-it-my-way-now-mode, so I officially told the<br/>\nkids about 3 days ago,  that we are not radically unschooling with<br/>\nchores anymore.  LOL   For two days we have been sorting through<br/>\noverturned toy boxes, with trash bags in the boys bedrooms, etc.  Oh,<br/>\nby the way, their rooms have been that way since we moved in!  I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to unpack everything, because I wanted the house to keep<br/>\nthat brand new clean feeling to it! Haha!  So of course, having all<br/>\nthose boxes hidden in their closets made it all the more fulfilling<br/>\nfor them to dump them!!  Piles of disorganized chaos fill me with an<br/>\noverwhelming panicky feeling that I can&#39;t even describe. Anway.  I<br/>\ncleaned my room first, still trying to keep with the &quot;model the<br/>\nbehavior&quot; mantra I have going on.  In between errands and gymnastics,<br/>\nwhile we were home, we turned on music and worked together and it<br/>\nended up being a fun time.  Before I reinstated the Chore Patrol<br/>\n(haha!), I was an angry, yelling, giving up on unschooling Mama, all<br/>\nto end up with a bunch of dancing happy kids that are helping me<br/>\nclean.   What I&#39;m trying to remember to do, to keep in my head, is How<br/>\ncan I skip the whole yelling, screaming and demanding part of things? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a bit more, off the top of my head. I have Naomi Aldort&#39;s book,<br/>\nand after my whole fiasco, I took it out to read it and could have<br/>\njust banged my head against a wall, I was so upset that the key thing<br/>\nthat may have helped me, I FORGOT to do.  (the whole taking a moment<br/>\nto pause and just thinking through the yelling, etc., instead of<br/>\nactually doing it!  argh!)  In talking with friends, I have been<br/>\nreminded that I tend to let things that bother me go on way past the<br/>\npoint of upset, and if I could catch it sooner, I could deal with it<br/>\ninternally and not explode on everyone else.  Any pointers on what I<br/>\ncan do to remind me to do the pause?  Thank goodness my children are<br/>\nincredibly forgiving and move on easily!

They&#39;re<br/>\n13 yrs, 12 yrs and 2 mos. I don&#39;t expect the 2 month old to do<br/>\nanything except be cute and make more work (diapers, laundry).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The hardest thing to<br/>\n&gt; swallow is the idea that I might have been making those demands or<br/>\n&gt; rules or restrictions for no other real reason than that they made<br/>\n&gt; things more convenient for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There is, of course, an element of that too for me and moreso for my<br/>\nhusband. But dh gets a little &quot;nutso&quot; in a messy-house situation, and<br/>\nas I mentioned before he hasn&#39;t the time to make it the way he wants<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I can tolerate more of a mess than he, but I have issues<br/>\nwith the kitchen and bathroom being a mess. The trouble is, I am<br/>\nclinically depressed (Major Depression, diagnosed & treated,<br/>\nhereditary), and that shows up mostly in the physical for me. I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the energy and it&#39;s not about changing my attitude. I can<br/>\nchange my attitude until I&#39;m blue in the face but that doesn&#39;t change<br/>\nthe fact that my body is just not on board with doing a lot of things<br/>\n- and I already do a lot for someone with my limitations. I have had<br/>\nto find coping mechanisms that really work for me, those things are<br/>\ngardening, bird-watching, cooking/baking, and knitting & crocheting.<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s not as though I don&#39;t set about doing chores myself. I<br/>\nvoluntarily go about laundry day(s), daily washing of diapers, picking<br/>\nup after the kids and dh, mending clothes and costumes, knitting or<br/>\ncrocheting wearable items for the family, making nice meals for the<br/>\nfamily, and so on rather joyfully, oftentimes singing while I do them.<br/>\nThe kids see this. Do they join in or follow along? No.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, my dd does clean her own room periodically of her own volition,<br/>\nand she cares for her snake in a way that makes me think she&#39;ll be an<br/>\nexcellent, doting mother one day if she chooses. And so I know she&#39;s<br/>\npicking something good up from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older ds, however, (and  he&#39;s 12), will leave things to go until,<br/>\nfor example, his room was so messy the cats had been using it as a<br/>\nlitter box. He finally cleaned his room to get rid of the smell, only<br/>\nthe smell had set in he let it go so long. He has to be reminded - and<br/>\nI hate that I feel compelled to do this - to take a shower, for<br/>\nanother example. I love him to pieces, but i don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nphysically near him if his body odor is repulsive. Hygiene is another<br/>\nimportant topic to me, but that&#39;s probably another email for another<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the best way to get kids to help out around the house is to<br/>\n&gt; not expect them to, ever. Never make it a battle. It would be best<br/>\n&gt; if it were a non issue from the very day they were born. Just keep<br/>\n&gt; cleaning up.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>...in a perfect world...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But…most people start out in a much more mainstream place. So then,<br/>\n&gt; if they find their way to unschooling, they have to undo the damage<br/>\n&gt; that has already been done.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is why I&#39;m asking. I don&#39;t really want to let this go as a<br/>\ndamaging thing or as a forceful thing or as a battle or something by<br/>\nwhich the kids and I alienate ourselves one from the other. Would like<br/>\nto find an amenable solution!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; it. If you are really just looking to have a clean house but can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; or don&#39;t want to do it yourself, hire someone to do it or change how<br/>\n&gt; you feel about having a clean house. Own it as being your issue.<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t make it an issue for your children too.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone else also suggested I might hire a maid. That&#39;s a great idea!<br/>\nBut we can&#39;t afford one. :-( One of our cars just blew its head<br/>\ngaskets and it&#39;s not a repair we can afford, so we&#39;re down to one car<br/>\nand scrimping so as to save up for another second/family car. We&#39;re<br/>\ngetting by in dh&#39;s economy commuting car for the next few months. Four<br/>\nadult sized people and a baby in a Mazda3. *blinkblink* ...not that a<br/>\nmaid is an expense we can reasonably justify anyway.

I know full well this is my issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; leaving it that way. This is your issue. There are all kinds of<br/>\n&gt; things that would &quot;work&quot; to get your kids to clean up the kitchen or<br/>\n&gt; whatever. But they aren&#39;t going to support an unschooling<br/>\n&gt; lifestyle. They aren&#39;t going to foster joy, love, and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hmm... But y&#39;know, I don&#39;t go into their rooms and leave my dirty<br/>\ndishes, clothes and shoes laying about. I realize that I was<br/>\noriginally talking about the common areas, but the analogy does apply<br/>\nto a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Could your husband do a quick clean up of the kitchen before he goes<br/>\n&gt; to bed if he is up late? Do you go to bed before your kids and then<br/>\n&gt; they eat and make a mess, leaving it for you in the morning? Or are<br/>\n&gt; is this accumulating over the day and you are wanting/expecting your<br/>\n&gt; kids to clean it all up?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>DH had been doing chores with them for a short while and he reported<br/>\nthat it did work. His putting on TMBG and doing various household<br/>\nchores with the kids did seem effective. This was at night after I&#39;d<br/>\ngone to bed. I&#39;m a morning person, the rest of the household members<br/>\nare night owls. He has since gotten behind with the financial end of<br/>\nkeeping our house running and so has gone back to that to catch up.<br/>\nMeanwhile, I still go to bed around 9 with the baby, and the next<br/>\nmorning  I find dirty dishes left around the living room and kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cook and clean up after myself while I&#39;m cooking. They cook for<br/>\nthemselves and leave the mess to sit. I&#39;m just not seeing the setting<br/>\nan example and showing respect working. I feel taken advantage of,<br/>\nlike they know if they make a mess I&#39;m going to clean it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; fun. It doesn&#39;t seem like something you enjoy either. Maybe if you<br/>\n&gt; changed your view of housework they would change theirs? That is<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which view is that?

For me it stemmed from the baggage I picked<br/>\nup as a kid. I was rude and disrespectful if I left a mess. It was hard (but<br/>\nnot impossible) to let go of seeing my dh and kids in this way.

Not day, not in a week.<br/>\n<br/>\n(If there are archives addressing this, please feel free to point me to<br/>\nthem.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~Stacey<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;a href=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/&quot;\">http://www.bobbarr2008.com/&quot;</a>&gt;Liberty for America&lt;/a&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Chores","postDate":"1089524591","msgId":1766,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5Ny4yYjg1ZWZhZi4yZTIyMmQ2ZkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1763,"nextInTopic":36713,"prevInTime":1765,"nextInTime":1767,"topicId":1763,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/11/2004 1:28:27 AM Eastern Daylight Time, we3deeves@aol.com writes: Although, I went to PS and I don t think I knew how to do laundry","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-44305803\">In a message dated 7/11/2004 1:28:27 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:we3deeves@...\">we3deeves@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough, &quot;I&quot; went to PS and I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I knew how to do laundry  when I went to college either, but I just <br/>\nasked and someone explained all  about separating whites and colors, <br/>\netc....and I <br/>\npicked up more along the  way, some by trial and error...but hardly something <br/>\nto <br/>\nfreak out  about &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat was my entertainment as a college student.

They&#39;d actually use a measuring cup and <br/>\nmeasure  the soap *exactly* to the line. They would carefully sort their laundry by  <br/>\ncolors into three washers. They&#39;d check the water temperature.

She used to call her mom, crying because she felt so<br/>\ninsecure. <br/>\n***This sounds to me like yes, she was insecure...but it probably had nothing <br/>\nto do with knowing how to do laundry!  Geez...how hard it that to learn if <br/>\nyou want to know how??  Maybe as a result of going to &#39;real school&#39; she didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow how to figure things out on her own?? Although, &quot;I&quot; went to PS and I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I knew how to do laundry when I went to college either, but I just <br/>\nasked and someone explained all about separating whites and colors, etc....and I <br/>\npicked up more along the way, some by trial and error...but hardly something to <br/>\nfreak out about   : )  ~~Denise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37043,"nextTopicId":37062}}
