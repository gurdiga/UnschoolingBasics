But a child who&#39;s made it<br/>\nto that level of reading will have gathered some<br/>\nphonics on the way anyway. I&#39;m just not convinced that<br/>\nit&#39;s a good starting point for every child.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree.<br/>\nJared (13) learned to read without a lot of questions about anything.<br/>\nFrom the time he was very little, he would bring us his pokemon cards<br/>\nor whatever needed deciphering and ask us to read it to him. We read<br/>\nto him.<br/>\nThat&#39;s IT.<br/>\nHe never wanted to know the letter sounds and the couple of times I<br/>\ntried to explain it, he totally shut down. NOT interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe started reading and writing spontaneously this year. Very well I<br/>\nmight add. Over the last year or so, he would occasionally ask &quot;Does<br/>\nthe letter ____ make this sound?&quot; and we would discuss how it made<br/>\nthat sound (or didn&#39;t, or what exceptions there were).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo until he could already read, he had no use for letter sounds. Now<br/>\nhe understands a lot of them by default. Trying to show him phonics<br/>\nwould not have helped this child, it just would have been a stumbling<br/>\nblock to his own process.  This same child could grasp large numbers<br/>\nand how the place values worked at a very young age.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo.....phonics awareness eventually happens. Doesn&#39;t mean we need to<br/>\n&quot;teach&quot; phonics, nor is that the best way for some kids to learn<br/>\ndecoding skills. It has the potential to slow them down if that isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to &#39;click&#39; for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra, by age 4-5 wanted to know letter sounds. She asked what<br/>\nletters made which sounds over and over and we DID do phonics style<br/>\nlearning because she wanted to know. There was never a lesson or any<br/>\nagenda on my part, I was simply with her, exploring language in HER way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer reading process was much more laborious and lengthy compared to<br/>\nJared. Each learner needs space to figure it out in their own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17865,"nextTopicId":18457}}
