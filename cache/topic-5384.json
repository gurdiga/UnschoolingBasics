I went to grade school during the <br/>\nlate 60`s.  Girls couldn`t wear any kind of pants no matter what the weather <br/>\nwas.If it was  winter we would wear pants under our dresses and take them off <br/>\nTHE MINUTE that  we got to school.I remember the school taking a vote to see <br/>\nwhat girls would be  allowed to wear. The list had mini skirts, pant suits,etc. <br/>\nAll the boys voted  for mini skirts.Just goes to show that no matter how the <br/>\nworld changes, it still  stays the same!<br/>\n                                                                              <br/>\n      Lyn<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, in  younger years (1-6 grades), gym <br/>\nwas mostly for running and playing. Of  course, back in my grammar <br/>\nschool days, we&#39;d wear &#39;hot pants&#39; (boy am I  dating myself there lol!) <br/>\nunder our skirts so we could change for gym  easily and then change <br/>\nback - jeans weren&#39;t allowed at all and I was in  5th grade by the <br/>\ntime &#39;pant suits&#39; were even  allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5382,"nextTopicId":5380}}
