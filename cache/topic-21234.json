I moved into a community house a year ago for <br/>\nthis reason. Well, not JUST for this reason, I believe <br/>\nphilosophically in communal living too. I live in a house owned by a <br/>\nland trust, and it is part of a community of 7 other houses. The <br/>\nbiggest problem is that we aren&#39;t a community of intention in that <br/>\nsince the original charter for this house was drawn up 13 years ago, <br/>\nreplacements room by room have meant we are currently a community of <br/>\nstrangers. So the support on the parenting front has been really <br/>\nsporadic. Two folks moved in recently who are turning the tide, and <br/>\nthe support has increased exponentially. We are discussing the long <br/>\nterm implications of making a commitment to each other. <br/>\nRight now, my kids dad is here way mre than I like, or is emotionally <br/>\nhealthy for me, and he offers support in certain ways and actually <br/>\ntaxes me in many others. But the kids are very attached to him, and <br/>\nthat isn&#39;t something I want to mess with in any way at all. Because <br/>\nof his issues, I am still reticent to give him too much unsupervised <br/>\nvisitation. <br/>\nSo it is hard mostly because many of my friends are busy with their <br/>\nown kids, and if they have no kids, hanging with mine isn&#39;t a high <br/>\npriority. Having two really changes the willingness of most to do <br/>\nchildcare for me because it feels so overwhelming. Especially since <br/>\none is pre-verbal and wears diapers &gt;G&lt;. Still, in the last several <br/>\nweeks I have felt a real lightening of the pressure and overload as <br/>\nGaelin has reached some developmental milestones that have made life <br/>\ngenerally easier. <br/>\nI look at how I have adapted my parenting to cope, and recognize that <br/>\nit is often an hour to hour kind of existence. We all get in the tub <br/>\ntogether which helps, we used to get out a lot and that helped. As <br/>\nfar as I can tell, the kind of survival mode I feel is just how it is <br/>\nuntil they get older. I used to put a lot of energy into trying to <br/>\nmake it be different, but now I have really just accepted where it is <br/>\nand moved into handling each day. <br/>\nThe comment I made about drinking alcoholically was in hindsight a <br/>\nbad idea, because it has become such an inside joke within my <br/>\ncommunity it slipped out without a context so for that I apologize. <br/>\nIt comes from the summer after we moved, when my husband was <br/>\nhospitalized, the baby was 5 months old and I was bewildered and <br/>\nvisiting friends, all of whom had two or more kids and a few recently <br/>\ndivorced. One friend gave me a gift, and it was these wine glass <br/>\ncharms that are supposed to help you identify your wine glass at a <br/>\nparty. So I said to her &quot;You know I never drink!&quot; and she laughed and <br/>\nsaid &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, you will be soon.&quot; and then we all laughed and <br/>\nshe told me they were actually for tea cups, because the other joke <br/>\nis I am always making tea. So now, the joke is of course that I can <br/>\ngage the kid of day I am having by how badly I feel like I need to <br/>\ndrink, and for two of my friends it has presented a way for us to be <br/>\nable to talk about what is a concerning habit, without defensiveness <br/>\nand hiding it. <br/>\nIdo notice a lot of other ways that I am apt to check out, dissociate <br/>\nor otherwise use non- substances to be unpresent due to overwhelm, <br/>\nstress and so forth which is why I said that I could understand. Not <br/>\nthat it&#39;s &quot;OK&quot;, just that it is what it is.<br/>\nCarrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"Nance Confer","from":"&quot;Nance Confer&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"nanceconfer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Why I Unschool","postDate":"1170856653","msgId":21234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwM2MwMWM3NGFiZiRlYWM1ZjdjMCQ2NDAyYThjMEB5b3VydzA0Z3R4bGQ2Nz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21286,"prevInTime":21233,"nextInTime":21235,"topicId":21234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Carrie -- Aside from all the other points about all the issues involved in parenting and unschooling and lists and support that you bring up, some of which I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-570941007\">Carrie --<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from all the other points about all the issues involved in parenting and unschooling and lists and support that you bring up, some of which I have felt, some of which I don&#39;t see, this one comment stuck out for me:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know it&#39;s hard.
