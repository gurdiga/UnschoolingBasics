Be sure to read your state regs <br/>\ncarefully.  It is not unknown for local officials to ask for more <br/>\nthan is required.  Sometimes they need to be gently and <br/>\ndiplomatically educated as to what is required of a family to hs.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve replied to local liason sighting the number of a specific reg <br/>\nwhen informing of our use for assesment rather than testing as an <br/>\noption here in NY.  Your best bet is to contact homeschoolers in RI <br/>\nand find out what format they&#39;ve used that has been accepted.  <br/>\nCertainly try to find unschoolers in RI and ask them how they&#39;ve <br/>\nmanaged the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep my paperwork vague...eg: my dd will read, write and work with <br/>\nnumbers and mathematical concepts on a daily basis.

We will use books from our home and public <br/>\nlibrary as well as resources from internet, video and film.  Her <br/>\nteachers will include family, friends and community resources. Arts, <br/>\nphysical activity and health will be addressed regularly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your state required numbers of hours spent on each &quot;academic&quot; <br/>\nactivity, you can look up what is required, divide it by the numbers <br/>\nof days in school year and put forth that he/she will spend those <br/>\nhours per day or week on the required subjects.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for testing, don&#39;t know about RI, but in NY there is a list of <br/>\ntest to chose from, some can be given at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the main point, is to educate yourself as to your rights <br/>\nwithin your state as to what is needed and DO NO MORE THAN THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if Montana had ocean property...i&#39;d consider moving there...<br/>\nBTW - if you can move across the state line to CT the homeschooling <br/>\nregs are pretty loose and I understand that there are many <br/>\nunschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\nNY</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2044889,"authorName":"Brendalee McGovern","from":"Brendalee McGovern &lt;Brendalee80@...&gt;","profile":"brendalee80","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 278","postDate":"1102867243","msgId":4277,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMjEyMTYwMDQzLjI1NTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyNjEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMDI3OTAwMDcuMTkyLjQ2MjU4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4283,"prevInTime":4276,"nextInTime":4278,"topicId":4277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Un Schooling Families How do you explain to your local Public Education board (especially if you at one time had a child in the public school system) as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-339219545\">Dear Un Schooling Families <br/>\n <br/>\nHow do you explain to your local Public Education board (especially if you at one time had a child in the public school system) as to how you base your day <br/>\nwhen they want an account of your children&#39;s daily educational plans <br/>\nhow we as parents assess the children reaching their goals so you can move forward<br/>\nand so forth <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 messages in this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nTopics in this digest:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.
