I&#39;m a makeup artist. The industry mags<br/>\nthat show bloody, gory effects do not bother me. I&#39;m fascinated by the<br/>\nartistry behind it and how to create the effect.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMost folks see gore, I see latex and airbrushing and ????<br/>\nSo for me, it has a HUGE effect on images not being as scary.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my children also. As they watch more and more of the &quot;behind the<br/>\nscenes&quot; stuff, the less anything scares them very deeply. It all<br/>\ndepends of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12466,"nextTopicId":12469}}
