Would it be more<br/>\nimportant that she followed the rules, or would breaking the rules<br/>\nseem the better choice?&quot; I vote for collecting a fabulous memory. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nVery similar thoughts have run through my head lately. I&#39;ve asked<br/>\nmyself, &#39;What if my child died tomorrow?&quot; What would really matter to<br/>\nme? What would I regret? What can I change to replace that regret with<br/>\nsomething sweet? What can I do *today* to make it a life worth living?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe always think we have more time, but that&#39;s not guaranteed. I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to live in fear of regret. My goal is to get to a place in my<br/>\nhead and heart where I can truly make the most out of what I have<br/>\nright now. It&#39;s not been easy for me to do that, I sometimes get stuck<br/>\nin ruts and unhelpful ways of thinking, but I&#39;ve noticed this question<br/>\nhas helped me move past some of my hangups and relax and find more joy<br/>\nin little things, to be in the moment and really enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a total work in progress, but when I think about what matters most<br/>\nin a situation like that suddenly my priorities seem so clear.<br/>\nThinking about the way I would want to look back on their lives, our<br/>\nlife together, makes it easier for me to see how I want to live with<br/>\nthem today, while they are here with me now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why I think RU is so truly worth understanding. If you asked<br/>\nany conventionally minded parent what they would do if their child had<br/>\n6 months to live I think their mindset would do a flipflop. I&#39;m<br/>\nbetting they aren&#39;t going to care if their kid leaves shoes in the<br/>\nhallway, if they don&#39;t like multiplication, if they used 40 sheets of<br/>\npaper when 10 would have done, or if they wanted to dye their hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m betting they would try to soak up every second, to give them as<br/>\nmany of the experiences they desire as possible, to make each day<br/>\nmagical and connected, to love and enjoy their child as fully as they<br/>\ncan. From my vantage point, families committed to RU have made a<br/>\nconscious decision to live their lives everyday like this.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Rules in the name of safety...some ramblings","postDate":"1182307078","msgId":24587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1YTN1Nitzb3ZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDcwNjE5MTIzNGg3NGE5YzVjOW9lMGNlNThlMTc2MzljMmEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24584,"nextInTopic":24588,"prevInTime":24586,"nextInTime":24588,"topicId":24549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Did I just lose what could of been a precious memory because I was afraid of what other s thought?

When I&#39;m old and dying  <br/>\nwill I regret that I didn&#39;t seize the day? If it had been my last day  <br/>\non earth would I of cared what other people or the city workers  <br/>\nthought? No, probably not.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat stuff to roll around and ponder.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually thinking about posting something along these lines, but<br/>\nyou beat me to it!:)  I have a friend whose child may be facing a<br/>\nserious illness. Hannah died last year. Sam died a few years ago. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have my Mom to share moments with my children any longer....I&#39;ve<br/>\nhad enough death experiences to really think about whether something<br/>\nis worth doing or not doing in the light of death.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways I want to live, that has to do with fearlessness. I do<br/>\nthings when they are &quot;right&quot; in my mind, when they make sense and have<br/>\na big enough reason to make it worth conforming. It doesn&#39;t mean I am<br/>\nfearless, but I try to live fearlessly. Does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was thinking about your dh and the kids at the playground, I<br/>\nwas thinking &quot;what if her child died next week? Would it be more<br/>\nimportant that she followed the rules, or would breaking the rules<br/>\nseem the better choice?&quot; I vote for collecting a fabulous memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m basing this on the entire situation. There was a concerned parent<br/>\nhelping, nobody was turning kids loose. The park was finished, just<br/>\nnot open yet....I&#39;m assuming no rusty nails everywhere or broken glass<br/>\n(though even that could be navigated safely for a curious child).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, I think uncomfortable feelings give us a chance to<br/>\nreflect, to grow and to learn. There are times that the uncomfortable<br/>\nfeeling exists to warn us, and we need to trust that. But when we can<br/>\nlogically examine where the feeling comes from and whether it&#39;s<br/>\nwarranted (or instinct, vs. societal training) there is a chance to<br/>\nexpand our comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s really cool that you&#39;re pondering all of this Kendrah. I<br/>\nused to get really uncomfortable worrying about what other&#39;s thought<br/>\nabout me or my children&#39;s behavior. It&#39;s very freeing to get past all<br/>\nof that and act based on a center of joy and trust.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Rules in the name of safety...some ramblings","postDate":"1182299211","msgId":24584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1OXM4Yit1YjJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDOTgwOTE4MjFDNjkzQy0xM0M4LUQzMzFARldNLUQwNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24576,"nextInTopic":24587,"prevInTime":24583,"nextInTime":24585,"topicId":24549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-Recently I took my 16 yr old along on a mom s night out for dinner and a movie.

The place we went is a classic hot dog stand, drive in from <br/>\n&quot;before Sonic&quot; type of place. The kids all working there were obviously <br/>\nalternative...multiple facial piercings, tattoos, various hair and clothing accessories. No <br/>\nbiggie. What was cool was that during the breaks, they were outside skating against a <br/>\nreally cool wall and some boards that the management lets them keep back there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls are way into skating. They watched and watched, and had a good time. When we <br/>\nleft, we had to drive around the one way road, and it was very obvious that they were <br/>\ntensing up, their entire demeanor changed with the approach of our vehicle, like they <br/>\nKNEW someone was going to hassle them (esp under the big &#39;NO SKATING&#39; sign...the <br/>\nbusiness next door put it on their building, even though they stay in the restaurants <br/>\nparking lot). DH slowed down to let them finish their tricks, the girls rolled down the <br/>\nwindows and gave cheers, and they all relaxed and smiled. They did some really cool stuff <br/>\nfor the girls to see. It just makes me sad that other people can&#39;t see what wonderful kids <br/>\nare all around us, they see a bunch of punks that have to be retrained, they bemoan what <br/>\nour world is coming to, but we&#39;re surrounded by great kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, more ramblings and a recent example of no rights. The rule of no skating is really <br/>\nunfair, granted, it does tear up the concrete after a while, but where else can they go?
