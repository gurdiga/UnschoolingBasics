Maybe that&#39;s not a bad thing. Maybe when a day comes along<br/>\nthat has been designated as a &quot;buy something for someone&quot; day, like<br/>\nFather&#39;s Day, we can think about whether that&#39;s really something we<br/>\nwant to participate in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree - to an extent.  I like a day set aside to further show our<br/>\nlove to our father&#39;s (although we try to show it everyday, my father<br/>\nlives away from us, so it is a great day to visit him and my dh&#39;s<br/>\nfather).  Actually, we usually make our gifts and rarely buy them for<br/>\nany holiday or birthday.  My older daughter usually will make a piece<br/>\nof jewelry or paint a watercolor painting or sew something, my younger<br/>\ndaughter and I will do a craft together or she&#39;ll draw a picture, and<br/>\nthen I make a card of photos of that person with us pasted all over it<br/>\nand decorated.  For Father&#39;s Day, several years ago I bought each<br/>\ngrandfather and my husband an 8x10 frame and every year I take a new<br/>\npicture of the girls and print out an 8x10 pic for each Dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not always easy taking this route, as my sister and her husband<br/>\nand my parents can be very generous with their gift-giving, but that&#39;s<br/>\nwho we are and we aren&#39;t about to change. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, though, my husband has been having a hard time since his<br/>\nmom&#39;s death (three years ago), so we decided to buy a bench kit and<br/>\nput it together ourselves.  We went to the mall to buy a small plaque<br/>\nfor the bench with his mom&#39;s name on it.  It was there, that I felt at<br/>\na loss of how to help my dd and myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that&#39;s probably more than you needed to know, but I just want to<br/>\nexplain it a little better - lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying &quot;No&quot; to buying the 50th thing for a 4.5 yo.","postDate":"1213466467","msgId":33797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczMTExMytyYXFwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1RDU0MjQ0LTlGQTItNDU0MC1CQTI2LTI5QzE3NTUxNTZDMUBjaG9vc2Vvcmdhbmljcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33796,"nextInTopic":33798,"prevInTime":33796,"nextInTime":33798,"topicId":33770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... recently ... away. ...

The first one is that your wee one <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; who she is, and she is totally being herself.  Believe it or not, <br/>\n&gt; resentment is a choice you make, even though it&#39;s by default.  <br/>\nWhen <br/>\n&gt; you recognize that you&#39;re resenting her for expressing her self, <br/>\nyou <br/>\n&gt; could, rather than allow your default choice of how to feel to <br/>\nkick <br/>\n&gt; in, make the conscious choice to feel differently.  I know it <br/>\nsounds <br/>\n&gt; easier said than done, but you really can be in control of your <br/>\n&gt; thoughts and feelings simply by recognizing it and intending <br/>\n&gt; it.  Takes some practice, it&#39;s true, but it definitely can be <br/>\n&gt; done.  Doing this will give actually her more space ~ believe it <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; not ~ to have different responses to the whole situation.  Don&#39;t <br/>\nask <br/>\n&gt; me how I know this.  ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You might want to rethink how much talking and explaining you do <br/>\n&gt; around this issue.  She&#39;s really not hearing you; she really <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t.  She wants what she wants and it&#39;s asking too much of her <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; defer to incomprehensible concepts.  Empathy is much better <br/>\nreceived <br/>\n&gt; than explanations, and it may help her shift more easily if she <br/>\nknows <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s being  heard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You also might consider re-reading your post and noticing some of <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; words in it that you&#39;re using that are ~ either consciously or <br/>\n&gt; unconsciously ~ setting you up for conflict.

All you *can* change and control is how you respond to <br/>\nher <br/>\n&gt; and her needs.  If you can make the shift to respond with empathy <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; see yourself as being on the same side, the same team, as she is <br/>\non <br/>\n&gt; (thus not needing any &quot;defenses&quot;), you&#39;re more likely to enjoy <br/>\nthis <br/>\n&gt; aspect of her, and she *may* be more likely to be a bit more <br/>\nrelaxed <br/>\n&gt; about such things, especially since you will have eliminated some <br/>\nof <br/>\n&gt; the resistance she will have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I hope this is helpful, Marla!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sending you love,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marji<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At 20:51 6/13/2008, you wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;I just don&#39;t know what more I can do when I don&#39;t have a choice of<br/>\n&gt; &gt;bringing her along on a shopping trip.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyparenting.com/\">http://joyfullyparenting.com/</a>&gt;JoyFully Parenting & Life Coaching<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gaiawolf.org/\">http://gaiawolf.org/</a>&gt;GaiaWolf ~ Music for the Planet<br/>\n&gt; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/marjizintz\">http://myspace.com/marjizintz</a>&gt;Marji&#39;s Myspace Page<br/>\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"wisdomalways5","from":"&quot;wisdomalways5&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"wisdomalways5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Saying &quot;No&quot; to buying the 50th thing for a 4.5 yo.","postDate":"1213428274","msgId":33775,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcydnJuaStkNmsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcydjRuYitxMHU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33771,"nextInTopic":33776,"prevInTime":33774,"nextInTime":33776,"topicId":33770,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... you could try having her write the list with you and talk about the dollar amount she can spend- say $5 or whatever it is for you- then stick to your list","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1208917994\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Marla B.&quot; &lt;marla@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried to reduce my shopping excursions with my 4.5 yo. as she<br/>\n&gt; wants everything.
