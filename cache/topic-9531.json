I haven&#39;t had a chance to go through all of them, but the ones I have listened to are terrific and really have affirmed our family&#39;s decision to unschool.  Kelly&#39;s talk had me laughing (Tristan even came downstairs and asked where the party was since there was so much laughing...from both me and on the CD), while Ren and Sandra&#39;s discussion had me nearly in tears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone looking for a bit of a confidence builder when it comes to unschooling, I highly recommend these CDs!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen wrote:<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Wes Beach spoke at the Live and Learn conference about creative ways<br/>\nof documentation for helping unschoolers get into college.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize he talked about that at the conference! I need to pull out that CD today!! &lt;vbg&gt;  Jody was just asking me about homeschooling kids and college.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9506,"nextTopicId":9243}}
