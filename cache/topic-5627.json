I&#39;ve explored MANY <br/>\ndifferent homeschool and unschooling chat groups and found the same <br/>\nthing.  I was turned off at first, especially since I&#39;m so new to the <br/>\nconcept of unschooling and felt snubbed.  I wanted to tap into the <br/>\nwisdom, but have learned to just lurk and absorb.  Groups like this one <br/>\nare perfect for newbies to ask those questions that the <br/>\nveteran &quot;Masters and PhD&quot; groups don&#39;t want to deal with - I understand <br/>\nbetter now why and no longer feel excluded.  We&#39;re just not there yet!<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":779600,"authorName":"KathrynJB@aol.com","from":"KathrynJB@...","profile":"kathrynbeth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: unschooling confrontation","postDate":"1118837533","msgId":5627,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFlZS4zZGMzNDgwMy4yZmUxNzUxZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5628,"prevInTime":5626,"nextInTime":5628,"topicId":5627,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/15/2005 7:59:28 AM Eastern Standard Time, unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com writes: I  want to thank you for your response; I have been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-906639735\">In a message dated 6/15/2005 7:59:28 AM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI  want to thank you for your response; I have been unsure whether we <br/>\nwill  &quot;fit&quot; into the unschooling community as I have seen some pretty  <br/>\nconfrontational discussion on some other groups.
