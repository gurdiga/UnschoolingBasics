He just turned fourteen and if I could somehow ensure that he was<br/>\nalways entertained I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat!&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to a Cinco de Mayo party of the fifth of May (Ha!  Who&#39;d have<br/>\nguessed?&lt;snort&gt;) and it was wildly entertaining.   We had a cookout on<br/>\nMother&#39;s day and invited family and friends and it was all about<br/>\nentertainment (with lots of food.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI own a much used and beloved copy of The Princess Bride just so I can be<br/>\ndelightfully entertained anytime I want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about entertainment might get a person &quot;out of whack? &quot;   Is fun<br/>\nfor the sake of fun a sin?   I think our early Puritan settlers are<br/>\nsending their uptight vibes to us even today.  &lt;g&gt;  That seems like<br/>\nwitchcraft to me... <br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently played Buzzword and had so much fun.  With a big group of<br/>\npeople you have folks yelling out answers when it&#39;s not even their turn. <br/>\nI laughed so hard my stomach still hurts.    But, I learned stuff, so was<br/>\nit &quot;pure&quot; entertainment or was it something else?     And I learned from<br/>\nwatching The Princess Bride.  My niece even took a trip to the cliffs of<br/>\nMoher when she realized they were a real place.  She learned a lot on<br/>\nthat trip.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has learned so much from watching &quot;pure entertainment.&quot;   He is<br/>\nvery interested in movie making and when he watches a movie he&#39;s paying<br/>\nattention to the lighting, the camera angles, the direction, the dialog,<br/>\nthe set design, the costuming, the musical score...  <br/>\nHe&#39;s learned about comedic timing, line delivery, melodrama, puns,<br/>\nsarcasm (maybe he learned a little about that from his family, too)<br/>\nforeshadowing, suspense building.   He&#39;s learned about movie budgets.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s learned and learning about screen writing.  He&#39;s learned about the<br/>\nstruggles of film makers to get their movies made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s seen every Stanley Kubrick film and every film we could find by<br/>\nother directors he likes.  (  He can tell you about camera shots in any<br/>\nscene you can name in hundreds of movies.  Hundreds.  He&#39;s been working<br/>\nfor two years on his own claymation film.  He and his cousins are talking<br/>\nabout making a B movie spoof this summer in the spirit of &quot;The Lost<br/>\nSkeleton of Cadavra.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even begin to list everything he&#39;s learned from &quot;entertainment.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe recently got the film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; on interlibrary loan.   He learned<br/>\nabout &quot;Eraserhead&quot; from a documentary on  midnight movies.  He&#39;s been<br/>\nsystematically watching those old films when he can find them.  Some have<br/>\nbeen easy to find, like &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot;  (his mom owns a<br/>\ncopy&lt;g&gt;)  Some are difficult, like &quot;Pink Flamingos.&quot; (weird film!)  He&#39;s<br/>\nwatched &quot;Eraserhead&quot; twice (so far) and he looked it up on-line and read<br/>\nreviews and read ideas other people have about what the film means.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s found interviews with David Lynch about the film.   He learned that<br/>\nsome bands took their names and others took inspiration for lyrics from<br/>\nthat film.  And he learned maybe the funniest thing of all about this<br/>\nfilm he watched for &quot;entertainment&quot;... It&#39;s been added to the national<br/>\nfilm registry after it was selected as &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the<br/>\nLibrary of Congress.    <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers: On the cutting edge of cultural education.  &lt;BEG&gt;  (well,<br/>\nI&#39;m amused though I doubt E.d. Hirsch would be...)<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, other David Lynch films are now on order through interlibrary<br/>\nloan and the Twin Peaks TV series is on it&#39;s way from Amazon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nDylan&#39;s already seen Blue Velvet.  And he&#39;s made countless connections<br/>\nfrom that film and the actors to other films.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are two links to follow to other ideas about TV and movies. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/tv\">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/movies\">http://sandradodd.com/movies</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is possible for something to be &quot;pure entertainment&quot;  I think<br/>\nthat&#39;s wonderful.

Old movies and tv shows can do the same thing.  My 10 year old<br/>\nhad a blast a few weeks ago watching a pbs show, Texas Ranch House. He loved<br/>\nit! He thought of it as pure entertainment. We all discovered a lot about<br/>\ncowboys we never knew and talked a lot about the dynamics between men and<br/>\nwomen, blacks and whites, rich and poor.  It doesn&#39;t occur to him to<br/>\ndifferentiate pbs from the cartoon channels. He watches what strikes his<br/>\ninterest. We have no rules or regulations about tv. They watch cartoons,<br/>\nanime, tech channels, pbs, sci fi, discovery, cooking, tlc, we all love the<br/>\ncsi, law and order and those kind of shows, and who knows what else. Choices<br/>\nare made based on what is interesting and, yes, entertaining to whoever is<br/>\nchoosing. And yet, the kids don&#39;t watch all that much tv. I watch more than<br/>\nanyone else in the house. I like it for &#39;background noise&#39;. I have my<br/>\nkitchen tv on most of the day (well, when we&#39;re actually home).<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~April<br/>\nMom to Kate-19, Lisa-17, Karl-14, & Ben-10.<br/>\n*REACH Homeschool Grp, an inclusive group in Oakland County<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reachhomeschool.com\">http://www.reachhomeschool.com</a><br/>\n* Michigan Unschoolers<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/michigan_unschoolers/</a><br/>\n*Check out Chuck&#39;s art www.artkunst23.com<br/>\n&quot;All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.&quot;<br/>\n  Gandalf the Grey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/16/06, Mother Earth (Tyra) &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Great response, Michelle!

Understanding relationships is a very important thing.  Watch<br/>\nthese shows with them if you have issues so that you can field any questions<br/>\nor clarify where your family stands on these issues.  Emily, my oldest is a<br/>\nbig fan of Degrassi.  It has touched on some very mature themes over the<br/>\npast few years (ok, since its inception with Degrassi Jr. High)  My daughter<br/>\nwas very upset because in the US they didn&#39;t show one episode where a girl<br/>\nhad an abortion.  There were other storylines in that episode other than<br/>\njust Manny&#39;s abortion.  We found the script online and talked about it.  We<br/>\ntalked about abortion and where we stand on it and what our beliefs feel<br/>\nabout it and how the government views it and also why it was censored.<br/>\nAnother thing to consider is whether or not your children *want* to watch<br/>\nshows with mature themes.  Mary Elayne is 10 and still doesn&#39;t care to watch<br/>\nshows that have kissing in them (not to mention sexual scenes).  Even<br/>\nanimated kissing is not in her book for things she wants to watch.<br/>\nSometimes those things that we limit are things our children would naturally<br/>\nnot want to watch anyway and if they DO want to watch it, then we need to<br/>\nknow why and watch it with them if you feel it is something that is<br/>\nquestionable.  There are some very healthy teen relationships being<br/>\nportrayed on tv.  Don&#39;t dismiss them just because they are portraying<br/>\nsomething you aren&#39;t ready to deal with because your children may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n Usually they honor my<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; wishes but they lost the Disney Channel because they continually<br/>\n&gt; challenged<br/>\n&gt; me with their offerings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Which is why you need to figure out what it is that draws them to<br/>\n&quot;forbidden&quot; shows.  Your children seem ready to move forward and you are<br/>\nfighting them to stay behind.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you recommend any limitations on hours of tv time or setting up a system<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; of earning that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No.  Not limits on television.  In fact we have 3 televisions *and* a DVR<br/>\n(which can record 2 shows at once while watching a third - you missed the<br/>\nwhole discussion of how much I LOVE my DVR LOL!)  2 of the tvs are in my<br/>\nkids&#39; rooms even - something I couldn&#39;t have fathomed just 5 years ago.

We recently upgraded our cable service to include<br/>\nDiscovery Channel 1 and 2 and the Animal Planet, but of course with that<br/>\npackage comes Disney, Cartoon Network, and a whole slew of other pure<br/>\nentertainment channels.  I get out of whack when I see that my son spends<br/>\nhuge amounts of time on pure entertainment options.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, of course, as life goes in cycles, today he got out the school game I<br/>\nhad created a long time ago (color coded cards of assignments for each<br/>\nsubject with options for assignments to advance 1-5 spaces)  then you get a<br/>\nbonus every so often and they can do things that I hate to do (painting,<br/>\nclay, anything that usually makes a mess for me to clean up).  Anyway, he<br/>\ngot it all out, threw it together, did 5 questions of the &quot;challenge cards&quot;<br/>\nand announced that for his bonus he&#39;d like to paint.  And, I let them even<br/>\nthough it was already 9 PM with the condition that they clean it up so that<br/>\nI would not be able to tell what had gone on.  They met that requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, he does get around to leaps and bounds in learning, all in<br/>\nhis own time.  I just have to be patient and remember that he is my twin.  I<br/>\nhate that realization but am grateful for the clarity of understanding on<br/>\nwhich to base my judgement - when I stop to think that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, back to the value of setting limits, I do not allow my kids to watch<br/>\nshows that have mature themes, such as teen boyfriends and girlfriends, nor<br/>\nviolence nor shows that I find display outright disrespect (as well as a few<br/>\nother things related to our religious beliefs).  Usually they honor my<br/>\nwishes but they lost the Disney Channel because they continually challenged<br/>\nme with their offerings.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you recommend any limitations on hours of tv time or setting up a system<br/>\nof earning that time.
