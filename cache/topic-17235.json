I get so sick of her asking, &quot;did you do school today?&quot; I have<br/>\ntried to explain that we learn every day, but people just don&#39;t get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not just a thought for some. We were turned in last month to a<br/>\nhotline because someone thinks we are such bad parents that our kid (the<br/>\nyounger 9-yr old) can&#39;t &quot;read&quot;. We are under investigation and threatened<br/>\nwith prosecution because we failed to register our intent to homeschool<br/>\nbecause we are so adamantly opposed to testing - which is mandated. There<br/>\nare MANY, MANY people who fly under the radar, but we were singled out. The<br/>\nDHS worker doesn&#39;t want to do anything about it, but has to see if the<br/>\nprosecuting attorney wants to do anything. It has been extremely stressful.<br/>\nBut, we refuse to follow a law which infringes on our most basic rights to<br/>\nprivacy and to parent and educate our kids the way we think is best. MOST of<br/>\nthe homeschoolers around here that we are close to think we are CRAZY and<br/>\ngive us no support. They think it doesn&#39;t matter just to take the test. I<br/>\nsay that all of them have stressed for weeks about the test and that the<br/>\ngovernment has no right to test my kids over things I am not &quot;studying&quot; with<br/>\nthem and then have the results that could someday be used to enact laws that<br/>\nmake my right to educated illegal again. Only 2 years ago those test results<br/>\nwere used to put kids back in school if they didn&#39;t get a good enough grade!<br/>\nAnd, they only tested half the grades they do now. So, you can&#39;t tell me it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I live in PA. We have a lot of laws and a lot of stuff to do to comply. I<br/>\nam an anarchist. I believe that the state shouldn&#39;t control what we do. I<br/>\nstill follow the compliance of law as they will jail me and take my<br/>\nchildren. I put my children&#39;s need to have me as a parent and their need to<br/>\nhave the choice to be at home over my political ideals. In PA they really do<br/>\njail you or take your kids. I would never put my kids through that!<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nWe KNOW our 12 year old didn&#39;t read much until she was 10. So, we have a<br/>\nbasis to believe that our 9-year old will follow suit. But, he would not be<br/>\nable to even take the test now, let alone do well on something so foreign to<br/>\nhis interests and talents at this point in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t believe that your child is obligated to know how to read at any<br/>\nage. There are other ways to prove that he is being &quot;educated&quot; or that<br/>\n&quot;learning is taking place&quot;.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are determined to hold out - though we could sign the intent and be done<br/>\nwith the investigation - or put them in private school, where the law is<br/>\nunequal and doesn&#39;t require testing (inequality is against the 14th<br/>\nAmmendment).<br/>\n<br/>\n***What will that prove? What consequences does that hold for your children?<br/>\nHow is school better for them than being home and complying with the laws?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI came from FREE states until we moved here last year. Another friend<br/>\nthought we were silly for worrying and has never registered or tested or<br/>\nbeen in trouble. So, it was rather shocking. But, I am believing that the<br/>\nprosecuting attorney knows the reality of what people do and has bigger fish<br/>\nto fry. But, the law was tested in 1988 and the people lost on every count<br/>\nin the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, some things have changed since then,<br/>\nincluding the fact that the tests are not used to put kids back in school.<br/>\nSo, we are hopeful the Attorney won&#39;t pursue it - but still want to work to<br/>\nchange the law and have it repealed. Better yet, I&#39;d like homeschoolers to<br/>\nfall out of the Education Law just like the Private schools so that they are<br/>\nnot under those laws at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I can understand that you feel shocked but now it is reality. What can<br/>\nyou do to create a safe life with your children at home?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA is not at all friendly to those who chose civil liberties over<br/>\nlaws. And, they are biased toward religious reasons, which means they help<br/>\nenact laws which are actually harmful to those who simply CHOOSE a different<br/>\nphilosophy and way because the laws they help enact are only useful if you<br/>\nbelong to a recognized religious sect that says they oppose certain<br/>\nregulations due to religeous belief. Yet, religious belief is anything you<br/>\nhold dear and with deep conviction - but the law doesn&#39;t see that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve contacted the ACLU, but no response.<br/>\n<br/>\nLost 4 pounds the first weekend worrying. I&#39;ve decided to fight the battle<br/>\nand let it go where it may, though money to fight will be a huge issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n***WHY? It seems like you have a lot to lose and that by law they are in the<br/>\n&quot;right&quot;.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe law says prosecution, jail, or taking the kids away. I seriously doubt<br/>\nthe latter - but I don&#39;t want a record either - but this is a just fight. We<br/>\nhave never believed in year-end, course-end tests - even though my husband<br/>\nwas an educator. He only did it because it was required - but he left that<br/>\nworld because he couldn&#39;t take how he wasn&#39;t allowed to help the kids learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n***How can you not believe in them if they are reality? You choose not to<br/>\ncomply. There are consequences for non-compliance. There are other ways to<br/>\nwork with the compliance laws.

Most folks get the hint and/or actually stop\r<br/>\nand think about their preconceptions - for instance, my aunt asked &quot;But\r<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t he have to go to school to learn to read?&quot; I politely (she is\r<br/>\nafter all the matriarch of that side of the family) said &quot;Why?&quot; Of\r<br/>\ncourse, since I know her well I knew that she knew that her son, my dad\r<br/>\n(her brother), and I had all been reading BEFORE starting school. A\r<br/>\npolite why stopped her in her tracks and she realized that school and\r<br/>\nreading did not necessarily go together. She asked a lot more questions\r<br/>\nbut they were of the seriously interested variety regarding how the laws\r<br/>\nworked, what we planned to do, and so on. That was some 8 years ago\r<br/>\n(before DS was even school age) and she&#39;s our biggest &#39;fan&#39; now - and\r<br/>\nwishes she could have homeschooled her son as well. Oh and FWIW for the\r<br/>\nfirst 5 or 6 years (since we were on this path by the time DS was taking\r<br/>\nhis first breath) we just said &quot;we plan to homeschool&quot; and left it at\r<br/>\nthat. We never used the word unschooling outside of the unschooling\r<br/>\ncommunity (mostly online at that point). Then we started using the two\r<br/>\ninterchangeably - &quot;We homeschool&quot; and &quot;We&#39;re going to an unschooling\r<br/>\nconference&quot; By then, the family and close friends could SEE what we&#39;re\r<br/>\ndoing and that it was not neglectful but rather was even MORE involved\r<br/>\nand attentive. That&#39;s when we started using the word &quot;unschooling&quot; -\r<br/>\nthough with random folks (hairdresser, store clerk, etc) we still just\r<br/>\nsay &quot;homeschooling&quot; and if pressed on what we do, use terms like &quot;whole\r<br/>\nlife learning&quot; to try to convey the encompassing nature of learning as\r<br/>\npart of real life rather than &quot;un&quot; anything which seems to just\r<br/>\nautomatically flip a switch in some people&#39;s heads.

Once you are being harassed, why on EARTH would you refuse to sign an intent to homeschool? That is WAY less invasive than what other options can happen.

It&#39;s one thing to fight the state if your children aren&#39;t at risk, it&#39;s entirely selfish in my opinion to put them at risk for your own ethics. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: new here","postDate":"1240359735","msgId":39702,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwOTFGQUM3LTU4NzEtNEI5MC1BQ0M0LTE2QTVCRkM1NzE3N0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdza2VkNis2bWloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdza2VkNis2bWloQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39698,"nextInTopic":39706,"prevInTime":39701,"nextInTime":39703,"topicId":17235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You are jeopardizing your right to homeschool and your children&#39;s right to be home.  You could be prosecuted, jailed, deemed neglectful, and your children could be sent to school, and worse case scenario taken from you.  Please ask yourself if this &quot;chance&quot; is all worth it.  Ask yourself, are these risks worth your civil disobedience?  <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore you minimize the risk, do some research.  Find out EXACTLY what your legal risks are.  Some states are very strict and prosecute and some are not when it comes to &quot;non-enrollers&quot;.  This has nothing to do with how strict the laws are either. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut it this way, if I ever thought I was jeopardizing my ability to have my children home with me or jeopardizing their futures in some way, then I would enroll straight away.  There are times when subjecting children to a yearly test would be better.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also don&#39;t know if everyone here is aware of &quot;kid watch&quot;, but there are posters all over schools and ads in newspapers with 800 numbers that anyone can call if they suspect your child isn&#39;t getting a proper education.

We were turned in last month to a hotline because someone thinks we are such bad parents that our kid (the younger 9-yr old) can&#39;t &quot;read&quot;.  We are under investigation and threatened with prosecution because we failed to register our intent to homeschool because we are so adamantly opposed to testing - which is mandated.  There are MANY, MANY people who fly under the radar, but we were singled out.  The DHS worker doesn&#39;t want to do anything about it, but has to see if the prosecuting attorney wants to do anything.  It has been extremely stressful.  But, we refuse to follow a law which infringes on our most basic rights to privacy and to parent and educate our kids the way we think is best.  MOST of the homeschoolers around here that we are close to think we are CRAZY and give us no support.  They think it doesn&#39;t matter just to take the test.  I say that all of them have stressed for weeks about the test and that the government has no right to test my kids over things I am not &quot;studying&quot; with them and then have the results that could someday be used to enact laws that make my right to educated illegal again.  Only 2 years ago those test results were used to put kids back in school if they didn&#39;t get a good enough grade!  And, they only tested half the grades they do now.  So, you can&#39;t tell me it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe KNOW our 12 year old didn&#39;t read much until she was 10.  So, we have a basis to believe that our 9-year old will follow suit.  But, he would not be able to even take the test now, let alone do well on something so foreign to his interests and talents at this point in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are determined to hold out - though we could sign the intent and be done with the investigation - or put them in private school, where the law is unequal and doesn&#39;t require testing (inequality is against the 14th Ammendment).<br/>\n<br/>\nI came from FREE states until we moved here last year.  Another friend thought we were silly for worrying and has never registered or tested or been in trouble.  So, it was rather shocking.  But, I am believing that the prosecuting attorney knows the reality of what people do and has bigger fish to fry.  But, the law was tested in 1988 and the people lost on every count in the Supreme Court.  Nevertheless, some things have changed since then, including the fact that the tests are not used to put kids back in school.  So, we are hopeful the Attorney won&#39;t pursue it - but still want to work to change the law and have it repealed.  Better yet, I&#39;d like homeschoolers to fall out of the Education Law just like the Private schools so that they are not under those laws at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe HSLDA is not at all friendly to those who chose civil liberties over laws.  And, they are biased toward religious reasons, which means they help enact laws which are actually harmful to those who simply CHOOSE a different philosophy and way because the laws they help enact are only useful if you belong to a recognized religious sect that says they oppose certain regulations due to religeous belief.  Yet, religious belief is anything you hold dear and with deep conviction - but the law doesn&#39;t see that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve contacted the ACLU, but no response.<br/>\n<br/>\nLost 4 pounds the first weekend worrying.  I&#39;ve decided to fight the battle and let it go where it may, though money to fight will be a huge issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe law says prosecution, jail, or taking the kids away.  I seriously doubt the latter - but I don&#39;t want a record either - but this is a just fight.  We have never believed in year-end, course-end tests - even though my husband was an educator.  He only did it because it was required - but he left that world because he couldn&#39;t take how he wasn&#39;t allowed to help the kids learn.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":313036834,"authorName":"lisberning@aol.com","from":"lisberning@...","profile":"strawlis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:new here","postDate":"1240320604","msgId":39683,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQjkwOUM2OUNGMkJDOC1GRjAtODRDQFdFQk1BSUwtREcwOS5zaW0uYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39677,"nextInTopic":39686,"prevInTime":39682,"nextInTime":39684,"topicId":17235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Anne,??

(Wow!  Has it only been 2 months?<br/>\nIt feels like AGES!   I feel like I&#39;ve learned so much since then!)  My son<br/>\nwas in kindergarten and having a really tough time.  He only went 2<br/>\ndays/week, so I homeschooled him on the days he didn&#39;t go to school.  Like<br/>\nyou, I had a really hard time sticking to a schedule and doing school at<br/>\nhome.  We never bought a curriculum, but I still tried to have &quot;reading<br/>\ntime,&quot; &quot;math time, &quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend introduced me to unschooling.  Once I started reading and<br/>\nresearching, I felt this incredible weight lifted.  It seems when you put<br/>\nmore trust in your children to let you know what they need, there is less<br/>\nstress about providing them with &quot;the right thing.&quot;  It&#39;s really freeing.<br/>\nAnd the more I learn, the more free I feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople here have been incredibly helpful in my journey towards unschooling,<br/>\nand I&#39;m sure they will do the same for you.  Enjoy your journey :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKim, in CO<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74055070,"authorName":"sunflowermom30","from":"&quot;sunflowermom30&quot; &lt;sunflowermom30@...&gt;","profile":"sunflowermom30","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"new here","postDate":"1210895743","msgId":32882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcwaWlodit0Z3ZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20024,"nextInTopic":32886,"prevInTime":32881,"nextInTime":32883,"topicId":17235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi! i m tina, mom to 7.5yr old maeven and 2.5yr old tyren (TEERen)...i m really struggling with figuring out our homeschool groove. i have read one of john","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1187860811\">hi! i&#39;m tina, mom to 7.5yr old maeven and 2.5yr old tyren <br/>\n(TEERen)...i&#39;m really struggling with figuring out our homeschool <br/>\ngroove. i have read one of john holt&#39;s books &quot;teach your own&quot;...and <br/>\nunschooling made a lot of sense to me, but i always figured i&#39;d be <br/>\nmore eclectic...some unschooling, some structured...<br/>\n<br/>\nbut reality is really different for us. i didn&#39;t really do much for <br/>\nkindergarten...seeing it more as a transition year and didn&#39;t really <br/>\nfeel that there needed to be much more than enriching play <br/>\nexperiences...so now this year has been my first year actually diving <br/>\ninto trying to instigate some sort of &quot;curriculum&quot;, but really just a <br/>\nvery eclectic mix of this and that. i&#39;m finding that since i&#39;m an <br/>\nEXTREMELY routine-challenged mama (can&#39;t keep a routine to save my <br/>\nlife...and believe me, i&#39;ve tried...A LOT) i just can&#39;t seem to keep <br/>\nup any sort of plan i make...and i&#39;m still not entirely certain what <br/>\nmy daughter needs since i can&#39;t seem to be consistant with anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe only thing i can say i&#39;ve done mostly really well is read aloud <br/>\nto her constantly. we go through book after book after book. fiction <br/>\nAND nonfiction. she LOVES being read to. and listening to audio <br/>\nbooks. constantly. so there&#39;s that. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nso now i&#39;m thinking since sitting down and implimenting a curriculum <br/>\nseems to not be working for us, or at least not me (and if mama <br/>\ncannot implement it, daughter cannot reap the benefits, soooo....) <br/>\ni&#39;m wondering if i should look more into unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\ni know from reading john holt&#39;s book, and from the unschooling chats <br/>\ni&#39;ve participated in in the past at my website (mommy chats, we&#39;ve <br/>\nhad several really great unschooling chats...i need to reread the <br/>\ntranscripts!) that unschooling is not about just not doing <br/>\nanything...that setting up the environment to be enriching and <br/>\nencouraging them to explore and setting up opportunities for them to <br/>\npursue their own learning is much more complicated than it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nso i thought i should see what i could learn here to help us out.<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m so tired of feeling bad about how things are going and maybe <br/>\ntaking a different approach would relieve my guilt and stress and <br/>\nhelp my daughter be happier.

Kids dont start reading because I teach them phonics or any other method they read because they are ready. ... All I can do is provide them with things to read...computers, games , stuff on the walls, books, magazines, recipes etc and then wait patiently. If they arent ready there is absolutely nothing I can do to make them read and if they are there is nothing I can ( or would ) do to slow them down. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
