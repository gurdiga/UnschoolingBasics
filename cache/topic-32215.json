We talk about it, we offer our own experience, we offer our  <br/>\nanalysis, our opinions - but we&#39;re not telling you what you are to do  <br/>\nor not to do. When the principles make sense to you, you&#39;ll follow  <br/>\nthem because they make sense, not because someone told you how to do it,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have chore lists. We don&#39;t tie allowances to working around  <br/>\nthe house. We don&#39;t punish for not doing house or yard work. We often  <br/>\nlive with bigger messes than we would if we made our kids do  <br/>\nhousework, too. We focus on doing our housework with joy - we focus on  <br/>\nit being a choice that we make for good and sweet reasons, to make our  <br/>\nhome a comfortable place where we love to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you understood was that you weren&#39;t to ask them to do  <br/>\nanything, then you&#39;re missing the bigger part of the picture. Live  <br/>\njoyfully. Treat children like real people whose feelings and wants and  <br/>\nneeds and interests REALLY matter, but, at the same time, remember  <br/>\nthat they are children who don&#39;t see the world through adult eyes and  <br/>\ndon&#39;t have adult concerns. Live &quot;together&quot; - this means live in ways  <br/>\nthat bring joy into family life. Forcing housework and yard work on  <br/>\nkids doesn&#39;t bring joy. Working together can bring great joy, though.  <br/>\nRosie came in while I was cleaning the kitchen and we were talking.  <br/>\nAfter a few minutes I handed her a dish towel and asked, &quot;Want to dry  <br/>\nwhile we talk?&quot; We spent 20 minutes doing dishes together and it was  <br/>\nVERY sweet. She won&#39;t think of doing dishes as a terrible task to be  <br/>\navoided, she is building joy-filled memories, instead. A few days  <br/>\nlater, the dishes had piled up and we were super busy. I left to go do  <br/>\nsome errands and said, &quot;Hey, if you have time and you feel like it, it  <br/>\nwould be great if you could make some headway on the kitchen mess.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess what? I came home and she&#39;d cleaned the kitchen. I shouted from  <br/>\nthe kitchen, &quot;Hey - great, you did it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was watching tv and she asked me, &quot;Hey mom, can you get me a glass  <br/>\nof water when you get a chance?&quot; I did it immediately - got a big  <br/>\nglass and even put ice in it. She thanked me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was a big sweet thank-fest! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMANY times I&#39;ve mentioned something about the kitchen being a mess and  <br/>\nnobody else did it and it got worse and then I finally got time and  <br/>\ndid it. That&#39;s okay, too. I really am happy to have the sweet times to  <br/>\nsavor and probably my biggest regret is that I occasionally stressed  <br/>\nout, got mad, shamed and angered the kids when they were littler and I  <br/>\nwas still demanding housework. Wish I could have a &quot;do over&quot; on that.  <br/>\nStill, time seems to have healed those old wounds and housework has  <br/>\nceased to be any kind of issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren - it concerned me to hear you saying how much you love your son  <br/>\nand you&#39;re so glad he&#39;s your son, etc., because it felt that doing  <br/>\nhousework was being treated like WAY too big a deal. Yes, it is nice  <br/>\nthat your 9 yo did it, but was he doing it because he wanted it done  <br/>\nor to get your positive attention? Seems like his brother thinks he  <br/>\nwas doing it to get on your good side - and was angered that you &quot;fell  <br/>\nfor it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of thanking him, another option would be to have said  <br/>\nsomething positive about how it feels to have done it..&quot;Great! Now you  <br/>\nhave room to play with your Legos.&quot; Or whatever is true in your  <br/>\nparticular situation.

So I said &quot;Hey thank you very much.  That was a<br/>\n&gt; big help to me.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>From what I understand, this isn&#39;t praise. Praise would be if you <br/>\nsaid something like, &quot;Good job!&quot; Expressing appreciation for <br/>\nsomething is not the same. I always try to express my appreciation <br/>\nfor things the people around me do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then my 11 yr old was upset<br/>\n&gt; because he said &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that Liam got to do that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ARGH what do I do there?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe he does want to help out more but he doesn&#39;t really know what <br/>\nto do or hasn&#39;t found that one or a few things that he really likes <br/>\ndoing. You could try giving him some suggestions of things he could <br/>\ndo with the understanding that he doesn&#39;t have to, no expectations <br/>\nattached, or asked him if there are particular things he would like <br/>\nto do. The other thing I can think of is to express your <br/>\nappreciation for other things that John does. Those things don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to be tied to you, either. It could be the way he plays a video <br/>\ngame or dances around when he&#39;s listening to music, fun things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"&quot;Karen Swanay&quot; &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Conundrum","postDate":"1209485457","msgId":32219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwNDI5MDkxMHI3MmY3NmQwMmo2YjY3NjYzMDM5MWQwZDhiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZBMzE5RjMyLUYzNjEtNDBFQi04RDhELTZGMTZDQUFGNTAyNUBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwNDI5MDgzOW4xMGJlZjViZXNlNmI2NTY4MjM3NDE0ZmZiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDZBMzE5RjMyLUYzNjEtNDBFQi04RDhELTZGMTZDQUFGNTAyNUBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32218,"nextInTopic":32223,"prevInTime":32218,"nextInTime":32220,"topicId":32215,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************************************** Well I mentioned how often because John was upset that Liam had done it so often. ...
