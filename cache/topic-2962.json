As far as I could tell, <br/>\nshe just wanted to sulk in a chair and no amount of gentle <br/>\nquestioning was reaching her. I asked if she was feeling frustrated <br/>\nor if she wanted to do something else. I asked if she had any <br/>\nsuggestions that would help. She just kept telling me nothing was <br/>\nwrong and she didn&#39;t want to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make things a little more clear... We do not normally watch her. <br/>\nShe lives out of state and was visiting my mom. When my mom left to <br/>\ngo on a trip, we had her stay with us for a few days. I assumed (not <br/>\na good idea) that she would treat my kids the same way most of the <br/>\ngirls her age have, that is in a nurturing manner. ie. wanting to do <br/>\nEmma&#39;s hair or play games with Jacob or playing outside in the <br/>\nsandbox, in the pool or on the swings. I could not have been more <br/>\nwrong. Apparently she and my mom had had a tough time together and <br/>\nshe had been staying up late every night to watch the Olympics and <br/>\nnot really having any &quot;down&quot; time. She showed up very needy, which <br/>\nwas hard for me as both my kids had not been feeling well and are <br/>\nusually a handful by themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I posted, I was just grabbing a break for me because I didn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to treat her with disrespect and was feeling frustrated. My 2 <br/>\nwere dressed and fed and wanting to go and I thought she would be <br/>\ntoo. (She had said earlier she wanted to go)Then I was overwhelmed. <br/>\nNot only was I disappointed, but her feelings were spilling over <br/>\nonto my kids who had been in good moods. They are 14 months and 2 <br/>\n3/4 years old, so I usually try to time things pretty exactly so we <br/>\ncan still get meals and naps in within a reasonable time frame.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also had been treating my kids and me with disrespect the whole <br/>\ntime she was here. I tried to talk to her in private about this and <br/>\nasked her to ask politely when she needed something and to not <br/>\nscream at Jacob and Emma because they were not used to being treated <br/>\nthat way.

I try<br/>\nto help them have conversations about how we can resolve it... So the first<br/>\navenue we try is &quot;Okay, here&#39;s where each person wants to go, these are<br/>\ndifferent places, is there a place we can all agree on to go together that<br/>\nis either one of these places or a different place altogether?&quot; and we<br/>\nbrainstorm that.  If that doesn&#39;t work, we move to &quot;Okay, is there a way to<br/>\ngo to multiple places that would work for mama, the driver, the time we have<br/>\ntoday to go out and what everyone wants to do?&quot;  I also include myself in<br/>\nthe mix, but equally, if I have a desire/preference to go a certain place.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in your situation, with two wanting one place, and the third not, I&#39;d ask<br/>\nmy niece if there is a place she wants to go while we&#39;re out and see if we<br/>\ncould do both.  Often if my son for instance is feeling resistant, he&#39;ll<br/>\ndecide to go if we can do the Dairy Queen drive-through on the way, or if we<br/>\ncan stop by the library to see Daddy (dh is a librarian at our library in<br/>\nthe town we live in).  If the issue is that niece doesn&#39;t want to go out at<br/>\nall, instead of viewing it as her being &quot;difficult&quot;, I&#39;d see it as her<br/>\ngiving her preference.  I&#39;d ask why ... maybe there&#39;s a game niece wants to<br/>\nplay before we go, maybe she would be willing to play it after, whatever it<br/>\nis, it&#39;s worth finding out so you can discuss it and see if things can be<br/>\nresolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to say that I think there is a dynamic with me where it&#39;s<br/>\nespecially frustrating when my own two kids to agree (sometimes feels so<br/>\nimpossible) and it&#39;s my niece who is holding things up.  Arghhh!  I really<br/>\ntry to watch that I&#39;m applying the same thinking to the situation whether<br/>\nit&#39;s my niece or my own child who is the one who wants to do something<br/>\ndifferent, because I think I do have a tendency to prefer the wants of my<br/>\nown kids, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s my own higher voice or instinct calling<br/>\nme.  I don&#39;t want my niece to get the message that she is treated somehow<br/>\nworse than one of my own kids at my house and I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to get<br/>\nthe message a friend or cousin is somehow treated differently.  The<br/>\nchallenge is coming up with the energy for that for this third child when<br/>\nthat third child isn&#39;t with me the majority of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\n&quot;I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than<br/>\nlive in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it.&quot;  ...
