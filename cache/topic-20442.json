And they are in different <br/>\nsections of the tongue. There are lots of things I couldn&#39;t stand the taste <br/>\nof as a child that I quite like as an adult. Being made to clean my plate or <br/>\ntry one bite didn&#39;t make a difference, it just made me more reticent to try <br/>\nthings as an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn looking for something to back up my tastebud count assertion I found this <br/>\nstudy: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ynyms9\">http://tinyurl.com/ynyms9</a> which argues for gene TAS2R38 making bitter <br/>\nflavors too intense.

Sometimes <br/>\nthings that are amazing to you may suck to others. Linnaea doesn&#39;t like <br/>\ncheese or milk, she doesn&#39;t like the bitter taste, the lactic acid taste. As <br/>\na child I was allergic to milk, she may have some of that going on. I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever really liked tomatoes and when I was travelling with two of my <br/>\nprofessors to watch their children as they rode RAGBRAI and we were eating <br/>\nspaghetti meals every night I ended up with a mouth full of mouth ulcers. I <br/>\nprobably had a low level allergy to the acid in tomatoes. Or not, maybe I <br/>\njust didn&#39;t like them, but I felt like I was a failure for not liking them. <br/>\nI felt like I was stupid and entrenched in my views for not liking them. <br/>\nLike it was a choice. So, when you are telling your child that they must eat <br/>\nsomething, they must try something, than you are telling them that you know <br/>\nthem better than they do, that there is no legitimate reason for their not <br/>\ntrying something and that even if it is something that they know they will <br/>\nhate their knowledge is founded on nothing and they shouldn&#39;t trust <br/>\nthemselves.

I am way cool with<br/>\nunschooling philosophy and raising kids in freedom - I&#39;m the one who<br/>\ntalked about the fact that this year our kids wanted to decorate cookie<br/>\nhouses and I spent $20 on all the makings for it, and joined in the<br/>\nmaking thereof with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe meet all our kids wants and their needs.  We had the good fortune to<br/>\nfeed our children with a plethora of healthy natural food - we had a<br/>\nmini garden as well as a neighbour who shared - before they really were<br/>\nintroduced to sugar.   So they had a foundation there.  I didn&#39;t think<br/>\nof it as &quot;restrictive&quot; because our family just naturally happened to be<br/>\ndoing what we were doing.  It didn&#39;t occur to us that kids were<br/>\nsupposedly  &quot;missing out&quot; by us not having it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it happened, we didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it, in fact we made<br/>\nbirthday cakes and stuff, and everything.  They know for themselves the<br/>\ndifference they feel.  That&#39;s why they never ask for it much.  When they<br/>\ndo, I&#39;ll bake cookies or something, or get them a candy.  We&#39;re<br/>\nuncomfortable with the word &quot;restricting&quot; being applied to anything we<br/>\ndon&#39;t particularly go for with gusto. I have a lot of baggage with that<br/>\nword.  They still like the taste of items made with sugar, and some<br/>\nprocessed meals, but they always end up going for the things they love<br/>\nbest, which is what they&#39;ve been exposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there room for different lifestyles, and what people make more or<br/>\nless abundant in their home that may differ from another&#39;s or less<br/>\nmainstream, and still be able to call it unschooling?  Can people have<br/>\npersonal reasons for doing things a certain way, and still call it<br/>\nunschooling?  For instance, can people who are vegetarian or vegan for<br/>\npersonal, environmental or ethical reasons still call themselves<br/>\n&quot;unschoolers?&quot;  Can Jewish people be unschoolers?  ....<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s something I&#39;m a little timid about.

So today I loaded up my son (9) and took him to Publix.  He asked if he could bring his book in.  (He&#39;s currently reading the fourth Halo book and it&#39;s too good to put down.)  I told him sure if he wants, but we were here to buy his food, so he might be too busy shopping for reading.  The look he gave me was so precious!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So I grabbed a cart and started asking if he liked this? or that? and so on.  As we went through the prepared food section, as I was looking at hummus, I noticed the cart slowly <br/>\n  moving away. So I watched.  The cart sat in front of the fresh cheesecake and strawberry pies with a very bright eyed (hungry) young man looking hopeful at me.  I told him, &quot;Of course you may have it if you&#39;d like it.&quot;  He asked me if we had enough money.  I told him it was fine. Buy whatever you like today don&#39;t worry about the price. He never read his book and here is a quick list of his purchases (he bought enough for everyone, too!)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Assorted dounuts<br/>\n  egg drop soup<br/>\n  hot & sour soup<br/>\n  milk<br/>\n  Orange juice<br/>\n  grapes<br/>\n  bananas<br/>\n  cream of mushroom soup <br/>\n  fruit loops<br/>\n  cherry pie<br/>\n  fried chicken<br/>\n  SUSHI  &lt;need to repeat&gt; SUSHI<br/>\n  ground beef for tacos <br/>\n  Top sirloin<br/>\n  cheesecake<br/>\n  strawberry pie with whipped cream<br/>\n   <br/>\n  He is very full now and very happy, lol,  filled up on the sushi and hasn&#39;t touch a sweet yet.<br/>\n  I love unschooling and the total concept behind it.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Vicki<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

BUt to not keep cake and cookies, even if<br/>\nshe asks for them?***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong but it might be problematic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are not sweet eaters and it would be natural for them to have <br/>\nfew if any sweets in the house.<br/>\nSome people are not meat eaters and so it would be natural for them to have <br/>\nlittle or no meat on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our kids are little we eat the way we eat and don&#39;t necessarily think <br/>\nabout introducing to them things we would not normally keep on hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our kids are older and especially old enough to ask questions about <br/>\nfood and be curious about what they see other people eating then I think <br/>\nthat&#39;s our cue to help them explore.   The way we do when our little babies <br/>\nfirst show an interest in what we&#39;re eating; we offer them little tastes of <br/>\nwhat we have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a case where parents have strong feelings about a food like sweets and a <br/>\nchild is showing interest in those things (because she&#39;s seen other people <br/>\neat them or has been at a house where those things are abundant)  then I <br/>\nthink it&#39;s important to address the child&#39;s need to explore.   I don&#39;t think <br/>\nthat means filling the house with every possible sweet treat, but instead, <br/>\ngoing about helping her try the thing she&#39;s asking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s likely that when we deny a thing a child is interested in, it <br/>\nmakes that thing seem more important - it creates more of a desire for that <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what if your child loves sweets?  What if she tries them and wants to <br/>\neat a lot of sweets?  Can you handle that?   Could you find a way to be ok <br/>\nwith that, maybe making homemade things with ingredients you feel better <br/>\nabout?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour child is going to try sweets.  She will be at a friends house someday <br/>\nand they will offer something and she will try it.  You will not always be <br/>\nin control of what she has access to.  She will be old enough one day to <br/>\nwalk to the store by herself and spend her money on something and that might <br/>\nbe candy.   So you can prevent her from having sweets now, if that&#39;s what <br/>\nyou want to do, but there will be a day she tries them for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may or may not help you to ask yourself whether you feel it&#39;s right to <br/>\ndeny someone a thing they&#39;re interested in.  You might feel it&#39;s your duty <br/>\nto protect her from foods you feel are not healthy.  There will be a point, <br/>\nthough where she will be making food choices for herself .  My feeling was <br/>\nalways that if Dylan had a lot of freedom to make choices he would learn to <br/>\nmake wise choices.  I believed it was better to have that learning <br/>\nexperience at home, with people who loved him and who could give him help <br/>\nand advice than for him to be suddenly making choices for himself for the <br/>\nfirst time when he was out on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are an example of healthy food choices yourself and if your daughter <br/>\nhas plenty of free access to healthy foods it&#39;s likely she will find a <br/>\nbalance that is near your own.  But it&#39;s possible she will at first choose a <br/>\nlot of sweets if they are new and that might last longer than makes you <br/>\ncomfortable.  There is the possibility that she will always like sweets to a <br/>\ndegree you don&#39;t understand or share yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like sweets and I bake.  I don&#39;t eat commercially prepared cake mixes <br/>\nor cookies but I make fudge and cake and cookies and sweet breads and candy <br/>\nand pies.  I usually make something sweet every week.  I think chocolate <br/>\ncake or nutmeg cookies are two of the finest breakfast choices available. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my kid is not much of a sweet eater.  I find that strange because my <br/>\nsiblings are sweet eaters and David (dh) and his sibs are sweet eaters and I <br/>\nthought Dylan had all the right genetics to make him a sweet eater.   It may <br/>\nbe that he just does not care a great deal about sweets or it may be that <br/>\nhaving sweets available to him if he wanted them let him developed a <br/>\npsychology that doesn&#39;t prize some food items above others.

Well, except<br/>\nmashed potatoes and corn-from-a-can, none other.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe lived to 4 3/4yo on breastmilk, cheerios, mashed potates, white rice,<br/>\nice cream, cheese, real apple juice and not much else I can think of.<br/>\nHe&#39;s never been pressured to taste, although I will ask him if he wants<br/>\nto when I make something new, and as of the last month maybe, he started<br/>\nanswering &quot; What does it taste like?&quot;.  I give him the most honest<br/>\nanswer I have (with brother&#39;s sometimes chiming in) and he sometimes<br/>\nchooses to try.  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe started eating commercial fruit purées lately and loves those. I keep<br/>\na stash that I know he likes in arms reach.  And also, some puréed soups<br/>\nare good.  Not everyone and not everytime.  But, he started asking for<br/>\nsome of these soups, so he likes them, I guess ;-)  <br/>\n <br/>\nSo, don&#39;t pressure it, don&#39;t hide it, be honest about what&#39;s in it, and<br/>\nfind new meals to try.  Be patient, loving and open-minded about the<br/>\nfoods they choose.  Have them help making a meal.  Make the tomato sauce<br/>\nfor the pizza ;-)  Add pineapple.

Mo&#39;s not a big veggie eater, but she loves to &quot;wild harvest&quot; <br/>\nfoods or eat directly from the garden. I&#39;ve shown her what&#39;s edible <br/>\nin the yard, and periodically she goes out and grazes! I&#39;m a big fan <br/>\nof edible flowers, personally, so I plant a lot of those. I&#39;ve never <br/>\ntold her she &quot;should&quot; eat them, or talked about them in terms of <br/>\nnutrition at all (actually it started out of desparation, we have <br/>\nsome very toxic weeds around here, and I didn&#39;t want to just <br/>\nsay &quot;don&#39;t eat plants&quot;!).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour ds may have reached a point of not trusting that you will offer <br/>\nhim things that appeal to him, so he&#39;s refusing everything, even if <br/>\nhe might have tried it left to his own devices. Kids can be very <br/>\nconservative about new foods - some have to see other people eating <br/>\nthem several times before they feel comfortable trying something <br/>\nnew. If you&#39;re concerned, find a multivitamin he likes so you don&#39;t <br/>\nfeel the urge to push, as it were. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets.  How do I get out of this <br/>\n&gt; cycle?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d start with a language shift - how &#39;bout &quot;loves&quot; or &quot;glories in&quot;? <br/>\nIt seems like a little thing, but changing our words -especially the <br/>\nones inside our heads- helps to alter our perspective. Right now <br/>\nyour perspective is your dd is &quot;out of control&quot; wrt food. Even if <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t saying that out loud, you are sending her that message in <br/>\nlots of little ways. That&#39;s a dangerous message to send! She&#39;s going <br/>\nto have to negotiate a world full of a million different food-<br/>\nchoices every day for the rest of her life, so the last thing you <br/>\nwant her to feel is &quot;out of control&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen had great things to say about desserts, here&#39;s my addition:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen trying to make good food taste good, I like to keep in mind the <br/>\nwisdom of Julia Child: fat is flavor. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love to add nut-meal to baked goods - I even like to toss some in <br/>\nboxed cake mixes. We all seem to enjoy that, and the added protein <br/>\ngoes a long way to letting me feel comfortable about cupcakes for <br/>\nbreakfast (that was yesterday). The protein also lets everyone <br/>\nfeel &quot;full&quot; sooner, so things don&#39;t get eaten as quickly. That helps <br/>\nfuel a sense of abundance, too, which cuts down on some of <br/>\nthe &quot;competitive eating&quot; that goes on around here.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also like to do all my baking with real butter, not margarine or <br/>\nshortening. Its noticably more flavorful *and* more nutritious. Win-<br/>\nwin. I use a modified biscuit recipe for cookies - lots of butter <br/>\nand/or nut butter, maybe some nut-meal *and* its ready to roll out <br/>\nfor cookie cutters without having to chill for an hour, which gets <br/>\nmy 5yr old all excited. A couple weeks ago we divided the dough up <br/>\nand made three different color cookies, and then swirled cookies. <br/>\nOooooh Aaaaaaah. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;re looking for ways to encourage healthy eating <br/>\n*besides* saying No. That&#39;s a big step of trust right there! Now <br/>\ntake a big deep breath and take a few more tiny little steps ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8667530,"authorName":"Manisha Kher","from":"Manisha Kher &lt;m_kher@...&gt;","profile":"m_kher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] encouraging healthy food...","postDate":"1168273636","msgId":20451,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDcwMTA4MTYyNzE2LjQ2Mzk5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0NDA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVudGZ2YStjcDBvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":20448,"nextInTopic":20453,"prevInTime":20450,"nextInTime":20452,"topicId":20442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are many<br/>\n&gt; times my children choose to leave it until last, by<br/>\n&gt; choice, but there<br/>\n&gt; is never any restriction on which dishes they eat or<br/>\n&gt; in what order.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Saving dessert until after a meal sets it up to be<br/>\n&gt; THE desired item.<br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re making it for the meal, just serve it all<br/>\n&gt; up and let<br/>\n&gt; everyone eat  what they want. Seriously.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jalen ate nothing but the dessert item for dinner<br/>\n&gt; once.

I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; found that if a<br/>\n&gt; young child can dip food, they&#39;re more likely to eat<br/>\n&gt; it. Ketchup,<br/>\n&gt; peanut butter (or other nut butters) whipped cream,<br/>\n&gt; sour cream, hummus<br/>\n&gt; etc....are all ways to offer up another food while<br/>\n&gt; making dipping fun.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Dessert can be almost the healthiest thing you<br/>\n&gt; serve!! I really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; understand why there has to be this &quot;no sweets in<br/>\n&gt; order for children<br/>\n&gt; to be healthy&quot; attitude (not saying YOU said this,<br/>\n&gt; just the general<br/>\n&gt; discussion) because if a parent is truly concerned<br/>\n&gt; about health, then<br/>\n&gt; they should be making foods that the child enjoys<br/>\n&gt; rather than<br/>\n&gt; restricting what the child shouldn&#39;t have.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If there are real (not parental fears) health<br/>\n&gt; issues, then why not<br/>\n&gt; look at it as an adventure? Why not bake and cook<br/>\n&gt; all sorts of fun<br/>\n&gt; foods that the child might want to try? Why go all<br/>\n&gt; restrictive and<br/>\n&gt; tell them what they can&#39;t have? Kids want to be<br/>\n&gt; safe, if they<br/>\n&gt; understand something is truly making them very sick,<br/>\n&gt; why can&#39;t the<br/>\n&gt; parent find a suitable alternative to the thing they<br/>\n&gt; desire?<br/>\n&gt; (responding here to the posts about children that<br/>\n&gt; were truly sick)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once again, &quot;no&quot; closes doors where an attitude of<br/>\n&gt; &quot;let&#39;s explore this<br/>\n&gt; situation&quot; brings about a number of solutions in<br/>\n&gt; which the child can<br/>\n&gt; be empowered to choose.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, don&#39;t set dessert up to be the most<br/>\n&gt; desirable dish, just serve<br/>\n&gt; it. Make your desserts full of yummy AND healthy<br/>\n&gt; ingredients and let<br/>\n&gt; them go to town.

One day she&#39;ll<br/>\nthink something is totally YUMMY and the next day, yuk.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna was the person who ate the most of her candy houses at Christmas,<br/>\nand yet these days she&#39;s lost her enthusiasm for candy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy letting her eat what she wanted (a day, or even a few days without<br/>\n&#39;adequate&#39; nutrition won&#39;t scar them for life), it all balanced out in<br/>\nthe end.  For instance, Joanna is less keen on green leafy salads<br/>\nregardless of dressing, but loves celery, sometimes with dip, a pita<br/>\nwrap which she loves to fill with colorful veggies (red peppers, green<br/>\npeppers, sprouts - depends on type - grated carrots or sliced carrots),<br/>\nan eye-candy array of pleasant looking ripe fruit.  (kids respond well<br/>\nto eye appeal, especially the visual type learners)   A pita which THEY<br/>\nchoose the ingredients to fill gets a lot of things in they&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she sees me having a few organic sunflower seeds and enjoying them<br/>\n(I don&#39;t initiate for her to have some), she wants some &quot;too&quot;, and I<br/>\ngive it to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I show a desire and craving for the best that grows, and she sees me<br/>\nbiting into a delicious red pepper with a tasty dip, and really enjoying<br/>\nit (not exaggeratedly, but genuine), she&#39;ll want to try it too.  She may<br/>\nnot like it, so we explore other options - together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve never been a &quot;dessert&quot; family.  It&#39;s just never dawned on us that<br/>\nit&#39;s something people &quot;do&quot;... I never grew up with dessert, much (except<br/>\nfor special dinners)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are stocked up on our fruit and crackers and snacky type foods,<br/>\nthey eat lots of that between their meals (plain fruit mostly digests<br/>\nbest on an empty stomach, and doesn&#39;t mix well with heavy foods) so when<br/>\nsuppertime hits, we relax and don&#39;t worry if today Joanna doesn&#39;t like<br/>\nthe basmati rice which she ate with gusto yesterday - she can always<br/>\nhave a piece of pita and whatever (she rarely turns those down), or some<br/>\npretzels as a snack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids help me pick out the fruits and veggies in the produce section<br/>\ntoo.  She begged me for the bagged organic baby carrots one day.  I said<br/>\n&quot;sure&quot;.  I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Now make sure you eat them this time, as I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to throw them away like usual&quot; (it was tempting though!)  And when<br/>\nI got home they barely made it to the fridge!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this post is so long.

I find if I do not at least insist<br/>\nthey eat their protein and carbs at meal times (pretty much the only<br/>\nthings they will eat) they won&#39;t eat anything and go right to desert.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nQuit making dessert. Let me explain....<br/>\nby making something sweet for AFTER a meal, you are automatically<br/>\nsetting it up to be more desirable. When we make a sweet dessert, it<br/>\ngets served with everything else that is for the meal. There are many<br/>\ntimes my children choose to leave it until last, by choice, but there<br/>\nis never any restriction on which dishes they eat or in what order.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving dessert until after a meal sets it up to be THE desired item.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re making it for the meal, just serve it all up and let<br/>\neveryone eat  what they want. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen ate nothing but the dessert item for dinner once. It had<br/>\nraspberries and cream, so at least he was getting some form of fiber<br/>\nand protein.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMake desserts that have doses of great ingredients. Whole wheat can be<br/>\nbaked into so many, many items....fruits make wonderful sweet dishes<br/>\nin combination with other ingredients or on their own (but you said<br/>\nthey don&#39;t like fruit alone right?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about providing a lot of dips for them? I&#39;ve found that if a<br/>\nyoung child can dip food, they&#39;re more likely to eat it. Ketchup,<br/>\npeanut butter (or other nut butters) whipped cream, sour cream, hummus<br/>\netc....are all ways to offer up another food while making dipping fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDessert can be almost the healthiest thing you serve!! I really don&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand why there has to be this &quot;no sweets in order for children<br/>\nto be healthy&quot; attitude (not saying YOU said this, just the general<br/>\ndiscussion) because if a parent is truly concerned about health, then<br/>\nthey should be making foods that the child enjoys rather than<br/>\nrestricting what the child shouldn&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are real (not parental fears) health issues, then why not<br/>\nlook at it as an adventure? Why not bake and cook all sorts of fun<br/>\nfoods that the child might want to try? Why go all restrictive and<br/>\ntell them what they can&#39;t have? Kids want to be safe, if they<br/>\nunderstand something is truly making them very sick, why can&#39;t the<br/>\nparent find a suitable alternative to the thing they desire?<br/>\n(responding here to the posts about children that were truly sick)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, &quot;no&quot; closes doors where an attitude of &quot;let&#39;s explore this<br/>\nsituation&quot; brings about a number of solutions in which the child can<br/>\nbe empowered to choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, don&#39;t set dessert up to be the most desirable dish, just serve<br/>\nit. Make your desserts full of yummy AND healthy ingredients and let<br/>\nthem go to town. Buy a multi-vitamin and trust that they will<br/>\neventually branch out and try more and more foods....but probably not<br/>\nif you make a big deal about it. The less said, the better right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":282271960,"authorName":"susangould1","from":"&quot;susangould1&quot; &lt;ggould1@...&gt;","profile":"susangould1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"encouraging healthy food...","postDate":"1168261930","msgId":20442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVudGZ2YStjcDBvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":20448,"prevInTime":20441,"nextInTime":20443,"topicId":20442,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I am from fairly new to unschooling and have been watching in the back ground.

So far so good.  we are really enjoying it and we are <br/>\nall less tense and stressed out!  My main problem is that my dd (8ys <br/>\nold) and ds (6 yrs old) have had poor eating habits from the <br/>\nbeginning.  I nursed them both for 1.5 yrs but ever since they <br/>\nstarted eating solid foods they will not eat veggies and fruit (even <br/>\nhidden in food - they claim it doesn&#39;t taste good!)  I have tried <br/>\npreparing them every single way possible!  My husband and I love <br/>\nfruits and vegetables and they are always available.  My ds won&#39;t <br/>\neven try fruit or veggies.  Not even a taste!  So I have long given <br/>\nup.  Now that we are unschooling -still deschooling - what should I <br/>\ndo?  I have let it go for years and they still do NOT choose healthy <br/>\nfood over sugary/salty stuff.  I find if I do not at least insist <br/>\nthey eat their protein and carbs at meal times (pretty much the only <br/>\nthings they will eat) they won&#39;t eat anything and go right to desert. <br/>\nMy dd is obsessed/addicted to sweets.  How do I get out of this <br/>\ncycle?  Are you SURE that if I let them choose what they want to eat <br/>\nthat they will eventually pick healthy things?  How long will this <br/>\ntake?  And how do I get my son to try fruits and veggies etc.??  He <br/>\nwill not even put them in his mouth!<br/>\n<br/>\nConfused and distressed<br/>\nSue from Ontario, Canada</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20678,"nextTopicId":20709}}
