But what&#39;s<br/>\npresented will be helping people move towards unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly. This list was designed with a very clear purpose in mind.<br/>\nThere are certain things that interfere with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPunishment is one such thing. When parents withhold, or threaten to<br/>\nwithhold things to attain a certain type of behavior, it does not help<br/>\nunschooling blossom in the home.<br/>\nTrust is essential.<br/>\nIf a child speaks or acts a certain way, unschooling is all about<br/>\ntrying to understand and be a partner to that child, not punishing<br/>\nthem or treating them as &quot;less than&quot;. Mirroring annoyance or trying to<br/>\ncontrol behaviors only leads to blockages in the relationship, which<br/>\ndoes not help learning unfold well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice here is about how you don&#39;t need to control your child, but<br/>\nbe their partners. A child that has had major control, will probably<br/>\nhave a harder time transitioning into a partnership style<br/>\nrelationship, but the faster a parent treats them with respect and<br/>\ndignity, the better things will be. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust stuff I&#39;ve been thinking about lately, and how very unimportant<br/>\nmost issues are that parents tend to make a big deal about. I&#39;m really<br/>\nweary of certain issues right now.....hearing from a child that they<br/>\nbelieve they deserved punishment because of their &quot;attitude&quot; breaks my<br/>\nheart.<br/>\nSo that&#39;s where my thoughts are meandering today. Forgive me if it<br/>\nseems OT.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12459,"nextTopicId":12484}}
