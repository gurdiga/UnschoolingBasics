It&#39;s more like throwing a bunch of kids into  <br/>\nthe pool to see which ones survive.

They either ignore the ones  <br/>\nwho are drowning and pretending or blame the kids for being bad or  <br/>\nincompetent.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe truth is that the kids who do well at social skills under such  <br/>\nharsh conditions are ones who naturally have that ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nRead about Gardner&#39;s Theory of Multiple Intelligences:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_intelligence\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_intelligence</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBring him home and let him unfold at his natural pace.

Kids don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to be &quot;bad&quot;. They want love and acceptance and peace and  <br/>\nsecurity.

Good grades but was in trouble constantly if given any free time.  And with him finishing his work before all the other kids he had A LOT of free time...not to mention lunch, recess, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school was desperate that I slap a label on him, so much so that during our first phone conversation his teacher told me to get him to a doctor!  My poor kid ended up at a psychologist in order to learn coping strategies for third grade!  As time went on the school came up with wilder and wilder claims...to the point of making Tristan out to be some sort of bipolar sociopath, and that couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nTristan simply didn&#39;t fit into the box the school was trying to force him into.  Instead of learning to &quot;follow the rules&quot; Tristan&#39;s behavior became worse and worse every year (his behavior was often dependent upon his teacher).  It came to a point where they were treating him incredibly unfairly...punishing him much more severely than other students.  For example...if Tristan and another child were caught running in the halls, Tristan would be sent to the principal while the other child simply had to put his head on his desk.  It was no wonder that he acted out more and more as the school year went on!<br/>\n<br/>\nI know if I had kept in school it would have totally crushed his spirit by the end of this school year.  Now I am slowly trying to undo all the damage that the school caused.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not necessarily easier than sending your child off to school.  I am at the ready 24/7 to help Tristan with whatever he needs...be it researching something on the internet, running to get supplies for a project, or simply being there for moral support while he plays a video game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124939329,"authorName":"Ellen Christian","from":"Ellen Christian &lt;scentednights2002@...&gt;","profile":"scentednights2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Questions and uncertainties","postDate":"1144551962","msgId":11418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDA5MDMwNjAyLjU2MTE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDA5MDE1MjU3LjQzMTMzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMyNDExLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11417,"nextInTopic":11422,"prevInTime":11417,"nextInTime":11419,"topicId":11343,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks, Priscilla.

I&#39;ll try to<br/>\n&gt; address your thoughts.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   1. I&#39;ve always told the school he was bored but<br/>\n&gt; they didn&#39;t believe me. He&#39;s a very bright kid.  At<br/>\n&gt; 7 he was reading the Harry Potter books. I feel I<br/>\n&gt; can address that best at home.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   2.  In Vermont, if you home school, you don&#39;t get<br/>\n&gt; a high school diploma unless you graduate high<br/>\n&gt; school or use a curriculum that offers a diploma.<br/>\n&gt; Many colleges won&#39;t accept a GED. He will be back in<br/>\n&gt; public school by 7th or 8th grade so he can go to<br/>\n&gt; high school and then to college.  He really needs to<br/>\n&gt; be taught the same style of math that our school<br/>\n&gt; system uses in order to transition easily back into<br/>\n&gt; public school. He does quite well in classes - it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the unstructured times he has problems in.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   3. Socialization to me means learning social<br/>\n&gt; skills. He&#39;s immature for his age. He has a tendancy<br/>\n&gt; to lie and he unfortunately seems to choose the<br/>\n&gt; worst possible friends to play with at school - ones<br/>\n&gt; who are similarly ostricized because they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; behave. I want him to learn to interact with other<br/>\n&gt; kids his age properly in a team type environment<br/>\n&gt; like organized sports so he learns self discipline<br/>\n&gt; and team work. I can also work on changing the<br/>\n&gt; behaviors we don&#39;t approve of like lying at home and<br/>\n&gt; I can work on bolstering his self esteem as well.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   4. I have not yet found any home school groups in<br/>\n&gt; my area.  There were two 7th grade girls who were<br/>\n&gt; home schooled last year but one moved out of town<br/>\n&gt; and one went back to public school to prepare for<br/>\n&gt; high school. I understand there are a few families<br/>\n&gt; that home school about 35 minutes from here but I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t found out their names yet or what their kids<br/>\n&gt; ages are. We are in a small rural town.  Our<br/>\n&gt; librarian is the mom of the 7th grade girl who just<br/>\n&gt; went back to public school after being home<br/>\n&gt; schooled. She&#39;s also involved in our gifted and<br/>\n&gt; talented program at the elementary school. She&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; going to see if she can find out about any people in<br/>\n&gt; the area that might home school.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   I talked to him about home schooling him and his<br/>\n&gt; response was &quot;awesome&quot; so I guess that won&#39;t be an<br/>\n&gt; issue LOL. He loved the idea of going to school for<br/>\n&gt; math to see his friends.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   He really loves to learn and loves to read. He<br/>\n&gt; loves Harry Potter. He can identify almost any<br/>\n&gt; country on the globe. He&#39;s interested in dinosaurs,<br/>\n&gt; planets, magnets, volcanoes  LOL and lots more<br/>\n&gt; things.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   I have a few books requested on interlibrary loan<br/>\n&gt; by John Holt and I&#39;ve been to a bunch of unschooling<br/>\n&gt; websites. My next hurdle is filling out this<br/>\n&gt; paperwork the state says I need to submit.<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   thanks!<br/>\n&gt;   Ellen<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Priscilla Sanstead &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:bobcatpris2000@...\">bobcatpris2000@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;   Ellen,<br/>\n&gt; My daughter went through the same thing 5 years ago<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; age 8---bus misbehaving, losing recess, forced (that<br/>\n&gt; alphabetical order thing) to sit by a bully at lunch<br/>\n&gt; who kept telling her that her face was ugly! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Many thoughts:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He may be bored,and not have ADHD if there is such a<br/>\n&gt; thing. They wanted my daughter drugged and I did<br/>\n&gt; it!!!---to my eternal regret. Smart kids can have a<br/>\n&gt; lots of trouble sitting still, they have too much<br/>\n&gt; going on in their brain. If so, unschooling is the<br/>\n&gt; answer. He also may be &quot;wiggling&quot; more than other<br/>\n&gt; kids<br/>\n&gt; to get attention---being bored and wanting something<br/>\n&gt; to do, and the other kids may enjoy it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Why do you want to take him back for math and have<br/>\n&gt; all<br/>\n&gt; those same things happen to him? Just because you<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t good at math is OK. We don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; our<br/>\n&gt; children. we facilitate their learning. If he likes<br/>\n&gt; math, he will be fine. There are so many math<br/>\n&gt; computer<br/>\n&gt; games and web sites (Living Math  and their chat<br/>\n&gt; forum<br/>\n&gt; are fabulous!), and you could get an older kid to<br/>\n&gt; tutor him. He could also tutor a younger child.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Socialization---what exactly do you mean by that<br/>\n&gt; really? There are a lots of bad things that kids<br/>\n&gt; pick<br/>\n&gt; up at school---from the teachers (self esteem about<br/>\n&gt; not fitting in the box, being different even if you<br/>\n&gt; are smart or slow, to name a few). Of course the<br/>\n&gt; kids<br/>\n&gt; have bullying/name calling issues, different values<br/>\n&gt; from yours, etc, and it only gets worse as the years<br/>\n&gt; go by. Does he want to take piano or karate or<br/>\n&gt; archery? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there any homeschooling groups around? There may<br/>\n&gt; be homeschoolers, even if there are no groups. The<br/>\n&gt; librarians may know---they see the kids not in<br/>\n&gt; public<br/>\n&gt; school. Speaking of the library, could you help the<br/>\n&gt; librarians start an after-school interest group to<br/>\n&gt; meet other kids---Yu-Gi-Oh cards or something like<br/>\n&gt; that? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I took neighborhood kids on field trips with us (or<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; went alone). We saw kids with school groups being<br/>\n&gt; herded, hollered at, having to take notes for a<br/>\n&gt; paper<br/>\n&gt; to be graded, hardly getting to see anything, while<br/>\n&gt; we<br/>\n&gt; looked at our leisure at what WE wanted to look at,<br/>\n&gt; then picnic&#39;d, laughed, and played til long after<br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; were back at school. You know how pointless it is to<br/>\n&gt; try to cram knowledge into someone that not<br/>\n&gt; interested<br/>\n&gt; (either they&#39;re having a bad day, or they aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; developmentally ready for it, or it&#39;s a subject they<br/>\n&gt; hate and always will). There is just no retention if<br/>\n&gt; you aren&#39;t interested. Google &quot; &#39;rithmetic and<br/>\n&gt; Sudbury&quot; and read about kids who begged to learn<br/>\n&gt; math,<br/>\n&gt; and learn it at breakneck speed.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you asked him about learning at home instead of<br/>\n&gt; school? He may be thrilled!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Have you read a lot? ---books, on-line, Sandra Dodd,<br/>\n&gt; John Gatto, old posts on unschoolingbasics, etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Best of luck to you.

I&#39;ve always told the school he was bored but they didn&#39;t believe me. He&#39;s a very bright kid.  At 7 he was reading the Harry Potter books. I feel I can address that best at home.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  2.  In Vermont, if you home school, you don&#39;t get a high school diploma unless you graduate high school or use a curriculum that offers a diploma. Many colleges won&#39;t accept a GED. He will be back in public school by 7th or 8th grade so he can go to high school and then to college.  He really needs to be taught the same style of math that our school system uses in order to transition easily back into public school. He does quite well in classes - it&#39;s the unstructured times he has problems in.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  3. Socialization to me means learning social skills. He&#39;s immature for his age. He has a tendancy to lie and he unfortunately seems to choose the worst possible friends to play with at school - ones who are similarly ostricized because they don&#39;t behave. I want him to learn to interact with other kids his age properly in a team type environment like organized sports so he learns self discipline and team work. I can also work on changing the behaviors we don&#39;t approve of like lying at home and I can work on bolstering his self esteem as well.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  4. I have not yet found any home school groups in my area.  There were two 7th grade girls who were home schooled last year but one moved out of town and one went back to public school to prepare for high school. I understand there are a few families that home school about 35 minutes from here but I haven&#39;t found out their names yet or what their kids ages are. We are in a small rural town.  Our librarian is the mom of the 7th grade girl who just went back to public school after being home schooled. She&#39;s also involved in our gifted and talented program at the elementary school. She&#39;s going to see if she can find out about any people in the area that might home school.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I talked to him about home schooling him and his response was &quot;awesome&quot; so I guess that won&#39;t be an issue LOL. He loved the idea of going to school for math to see his friends.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  He really loves to learn and loves to read. He loves Harry Potter. He can identify almost any country on the globe. He&#39;s interested in dinosaurs, planets, magnets, volcanoes  LOL and lots more things.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have a few books requested on interlibrary loan by John Holt and I&#39;ve been to a bunch of unschooling websites.

I am responding because your story is so similar to ours. My son Anthony is 10 and does great academically and is a great kid but socially was another problem. He just didn&#39;t fit in to what the school seems to want and over the years I found it kept getting worse instead of better. His self esteem was getting crushed and I kept him in school because I kept listening to other people saying he won&#39;t ever learn social skills if you take him out etc etc.<br/>\n  This year I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I spoke with different homeschoolers/unschoolers and got a different response than what I kept getting from his school. Everyone told me the same thing.....take him out of school and he will change for the better....he will start to feel more comfortable and his self esteem will start to be restored...and guess what......its been about a month and the change in him is amazing....totally incredible!! He is relaxed and happy....its a joy for me to see this in him everyday!!!!!<br/>\n   Anthony also loves math and science.....so I chose to get him a tutor who specializes in these subjects so Anthony can ask him all the questions he wants....we do it in a very unstructured way....its really cool. I am just awful in math and science so I felt going with a tutor was a great idea for us. I didn&#39;t want anything to do with the school district anymore.<br/>\n  I hope my little story helps!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Peace<br/>\n  Karen in NY<br/>\n<br/>\nEllen Christian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:scentednights2002@...\">scentednights2002@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  My son is 8 and is having some problems in school with social skills, etc. His grades are very good As/Bs and he likes school but he has ADHD and just isn&#39;t fitting into the school&#39;s &quot;box&quot; very well during their unstructured times (recess, lunch, etc.) He does OK in classes but cannot take the bus and keeps getting in trouble in unstructured times.

My son does scouting, so has had that all along, <br/>\nbut I also always worked at making sure there were playdates and <br/>\nsuch.

Paintball?<br/>\nBowling?  All those activities can bring in socialization.  Look for an<br/>\nunschooling yahoogroup in your area (or at least in your state so you can<br/>\nhook up with other unschoolers in your area).  Do you go to church?  Taking<br/>\nhim out of school does not mean you have to take away any friends he has<br/>\nmade from school.  My oldest daughter still is friends with her best friend<br/>\nfrom one of her forays into public school.  They call each other on the<br/>\nphone and chat online.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization doesn&#39;t have to be limited to being around other children nor<br/>\nchildren your child&#39;s age.  Do you only socialize with adults your own age<br/>\nor do you have a wide age group of people with whom you socialize.  People<br/>\nare often impressed that my children can communicate to adults.  Why<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t the be able to?  They&#39;ve spent their lives talking with people in<br/>\nevery age group not just isolated with a bunch of other kids.  School is an<br/>\nartificial socialization situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have one child who doesn&#39;t crave being around other children.  He<br/>\nenjoys them (for the most part) when we do things with other families, but<br/>\nhe is just as content to do things with adults or by himself.  He would much<br/>\nprefer to go to my dad&#39;s house and climb under his house and help him move<br/>\nstuff or tape up pipes for the winter than go to resource day and if my dad<br/>\noffered to walk him up to Krispy Kreme for a donut he would choose that over<br/>\na birthday party!
