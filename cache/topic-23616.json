I&#39;ve seen a lot of moms who&#39;ve been <br/>\nthere, done that, respond in a very passionate way. And yes, perhaps without all the <br/>\ninformation, but you didn&#39;t post more information. They only had what they posted with. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is hard to feel that you have to defend yourself. But no one is asking you to, what they <br/>\nare asking is that you look at the entire situation outside of where you already are, and <br/>\nthat&#39;s the opportunity you have! By seeing how we are seeing the situation, you have the <br/>\nopportunity to see it outside of yourself. I think you are so close that you feel abraided.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one of the hardest things I ever heard on this group, was after I posted <br/>\nsomething and Sandra Dodd told me that if I did not like how people were perceiving my <br/>\nfamily, then I needed to be much more precise in describing the situation. We aren&#39;t <br/>\n&#39;rushing&#39; into conclusions per se, but asking a million questions to verify something does <br/>\ntake a lot of time, something most of us don&#39;t have a lot to spare. It did very much seem <br/>\nto me that you spent a lot of time &#39;talking&#39; with your son explaining how you felt about the <br/>\nshow, and then was frustrated that he didn&#39;t agree with you at the end. I don&#39;t know that I <br/>\nwould like the show you described either, and I can assure you that unschooled children <br/>\nwho have freedom of choice, and are not interested in the show, will not choose to watch <br/>\nthat show. They will leave or change the channel or complain. Kids who are interested are <br/>\nobviously understanding *something*, it doesn&#39;t even have to be the sexual innuendo. My <br/>\neight year old would watch that and not even catch it...she would be engrossed in the idea <br/>\nof eating worms, but the sex would not even be heard. My 12 year old would totally catch <br/>\nit and be intrigued and embarrassed because of hormones, but talking with me or dad <br/>\nwould clear up a lot of that. If he felt embarrassed and then felt judged by me, then he <br/>\nmight choose to not watch, and then I&#39;d feel my own sort of shame for providing an <br/>\nunnecessary limit. My husband would probably laugh his butt off, and I&#39;d be in another <br/>\nroom playing with the people who were not interested. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre limits ever needed? Well, yeah, I don&#39;t let my daughter (18 months) play in the street <br/>\nduring rush hour. I will find a better place for her to run, whether it be another street, the <br/>\npark, our backyard. Are TV limits ever needed? I like the way Ren described it. That&#39;s what <br/>\nwe do in our family. Our kids can watch what they want, I&#39;m totally there. We have several <br/>\nTV&#39;s so that the little&#39;s feel that they have a choice if a big kid is watching something they <br/>\ndon&#39;t like. We have LOTS of other things to do, crafts and books, mud and toys, video <br/>\ngames and movies. Computers are very popular here, and Josh actually now watches more <br/>\nstuff online to help Sam and Dan have more opportunity to watch what they like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I&#39;m rambling only because the kids are putting on their own &#39;movie&#39; about Teddy <br/>\nBear cannibals that eat cotton underwear when they can&#39;t catch one of their own, and I <br/>\nhave about ten minutes before the laundry loads need changed. WOohOo! Just know that <br/>\nit&#39;s the hardest journey, but one which is so rewarding.

After a few weeks, he asked her to push him a <br/>\nlittle to do the lessons--he told her than he could handle how hard <br/>\nthe lessons were for him and he was still committed, but handling the <br/>\nwork AND being responsible for finding time in his day to do it were <br/>\ntoo much for him. He asked her to carry part of the burden for him, <br/>\nby taking responsibility for reminding him at the time of day they <br/>\nhad agreed on to sit down with his workbook, and helping him get <br/>\nsettled.

I must admit to not reading all  of <br/>\nthe posts in the thread.  But I think yes.  There may be situations  where a <br/>\nchild or an adult may want to limit things, but not be in a relationship  where <br/>\nthey feel they can express that.  So they might keep that inside, but  really <br/>\nwant to limit themselves and not know how exactly to go about setting  goals, <br/>\nlimits, etc.  I do think it has to come from inside the person  though.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think anyone can set limits for another person without  setting that person <br/>\nup for failure (or success I guess).  I haven&#39;t really  thought a whole lot <br/>\nabout it because my boys have never asked for limits.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think self imposed boundaries are always in flux.  I may set limits  on <br/>\nthings for myself, but I may decide that it is OK to go outside those limits  on <br/>\noccasion, or not.  I have the power to control those boundaries.  I  might <br/>\nshare those decisions with my family or friends and then again I might  not.  But <br/>\nfor me there is no failure.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t see that as your situation though.  I think you have concerns  for <br/>\nthe content of the programs your child is watching and you have asked if he  is <br/>\nwanting limits and he said no.  I am not sure he shares your concern for  his <br/>\nTV watching.  Maybe you need to really think about what it is you  want/need.  <br/>\nAnd maybe he as well.  Do you really want him to stop  watching or do you <br/>\nwant a healthy, happy child, who, when not in your presence,  can watch TV and be <br/>\nable to make decisions for himself that he will be happy  with etc etc.  Are <br/>\nyou afraid that watching the programs he is watching  will lead him to <br/>\n.......(I guess you have to fill in the blank).<br/>\n <br/>\nIf it were me I would think about it myself, what it is I really want/need  <br/>\nout of the situation, and my relationship with my son.  And then approach  it <br/>\nfrom that angle.  Talking to him about what it is he needs/wants and  find <br/>\nmutually agreeable solutions to the problem where you both get what you  want and <br/>\nboth of you are happy with the outcome.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust a couple of my thoughts this morning.<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Are limits ever good or needed?","postDate":"1179321263","msgId":23678,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDcwMWM3OTdiYyQxZmI1YzM0MCQwMjAxYThjMEBkZWJvcmFoNzZhNzlodj4="},"prevInTopic":23672,"nextInTopic":23680,"prevInTime":23677,"nextInTime":23679,"topicId":23616,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***But the regular posters know that asking for limits indicates something has interfered with his trust in himself ...*** And this child isn t asking for","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1455176674\">***But the regular posters know that asking for limits indicates something <br/>\nhas<br/>\ninterfered with his trust in himself ...***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this child isn&#39;t asking for limits.

The idea that preschool is good for kids because it fosters  <br/>\nindependence is very popular!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we step back away from that particular tree marked  <br/>\n&quot;independence&quot; to look at the forest, why would it be a good idea for  <br/>\na *3 yo* to be independent of his family?

What would cause someone to  <br/>\nfeel they need someone else to erect boundaries around them? Why  <br/>\nwould they feel their own boundaries for themselves weren&#39;t good enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout boundaries a free person is free to go where ever they want  <br/>\nand do whatever they want (within the law).<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite what those who have been raised with restrictions believe, a  <br/>\nperson who is raised free -- as children of long time unschoolers are  <br/>\n-- *don&#39;t* go everywhere and do everything. They do what they want to  <br/>\ndo and avoid doing what they don&#39;t want. They create boundaries of  <br/>\nchoice basically. They choose not to punch someone to take what they  <br/>\nhave. They choose not to watch pornography. They choose not to read  <br/>\nHarry Potter. They choose not to be friends with someone that makes  <br/>\nthem feel uncomfortable. They choose not to watch Seventh Heaven.  <br/>\nThey choose not to watch Blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut why would someone with the freedom to choose or not choose  <br/>\nsomething, come to feel they need someone to stop them from making a  <br/>\nchoice?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an important question to ask because it isn&#39;t conducive to  <br/>\nhappiness and wholeness to want someone else to limit your life for  <br/>\nyou. Certainly people *have* reached the point where they have asked  <br/>\nother to limit them. But it doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen.&quot; There is a cause,  <br/>\na reason and dealing with that reason will help someone return to a  <br/>\npath to wholeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone who is asking someone else to limit them rather than limiting  <br/>\nthemselves has lost trust in themselves. They had the freedom and  <br/>\nthey&#39;re saying &quot;Take it away. I can&#39;t trust myself with it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be comforting for a parent to hear a child ask for limits.  <br/>\nTrusting is scary! What parent doesn&#39;t feel a pinch of fear when  <br/>\ntheir child takes the car keys to drive on their own for the first  <br/>\ntime? It would be very comforting to those fears to hear the child  <br/>\nsay &quot;Don&#39;t allow me to drive further than 2 miles from home,&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t let me drive at night,&quot; or &quot;Put a curfew on me so I&#39;m home by  <br/>\n9PM.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that comfort is a trap. It might feel good to us but won&#39;t *help*  <br/>\na child grow towards happiness. (It&#39;s not that a child will be  <br/>\ndamaged by imposing limits. It&#39;s that it won&#39;t *help* him grow.  <br/>\nSometimes kids come out of something unhelpful we&#39;ve done perfectly  <br/>\nfine. But they&#39;ve done it *despite* what we&#39;ve done, not because of  <br/>\nit. We put up a roadblock but they managed to get around it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s way better to *help* them grow than to nurture roadblocks that  <br/>\nthey might or might not navigate around unscathed.<br/>\n<br/>\n From what you wrote it sounds like he initially asked you to limit  <br/>\nhim after your long discussion. It could be you scared him and he  <br/>\nlost trust in himself (for a moment since he&#39;s changed his mind now,  <br/>\nbut even a moment isn&#39;t helpful to him).

I guess at the root of it, though, is whether limits are ever appropriate, and when? And can a child say that they want to do something, but hope that you won&#39;t allow it? I will say at the outset that everything below has been discussed at length with my son. Our dialog has been extensive but has not lead to a resolution. I&#39;d like to simplify my question, and invite responses to that simpler question. Below that I&#39;d like to elaborate on the questions more as they pertain to my particular child, for those with the patience or time to read that!<br/>\nHere goes: The simple question/problem is this: my 13 yo ds has been wanting to watch TV alone from about 8:00 pm until 5:00 am for about 10 weeks. He occasionally wakes me up to watch a movie or look at something on the internet, but mostly he prefers to be alone. I have seen that some of the shows don&#39;t seem very good to me. I have at times brought up concerns, when he has (rarely) let me watch with him. But last night there was a reason he watched several hours with me nearby. The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very carefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They filled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was so sorry to find included my son. I am not naive; I am 46, have been through much in life and I work in an ER. I am not that easily shocked. I doubt that my feelings were unreasonable. I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went on for a while, but no agreement could be reached. He at<br/>\nfirst thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so frequently, could harm him, that I lacked trust in him. I went over again my belief that frequent exposure to anything will begin to influence almost anybody. He began to say..&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t allow this.&quot; But he did not say that he wouldn&#39;t watch it again. I said that I was so torn...that I did not want to control what he watched. I asked him how he&#39;d feel if I disallowed these shows, and the words felt alien in my mouth. But a part of me felt almost like he was looking for a firmer guide. This feeling is very concerning to me, like my intuition is telling me that he wants me to forbid these shows. So...I&#39;d love opinions on this case in particular and on the question about limits in general. Thanks you!!<br/>\nAlthough I planned to continue here, this is enough for now.

One of my children has some very OC behaviors and feelings, and sometimes he asks me for my help in helping him reach goals, which does require setting limits.  The difference I see is that A) he chooses the limits and B) he asked me to remind him of the limits he chose and C) when he tells me he has chosen to ignore his own limits (knowing well the risks/consequences because we&#39;ve discussed them at length) and I respect that.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We arrived at this point when he told me he was disappointed to miss some of his goals and needed help limiting himself.  I told him I won&#39;t impose my own limits on him, but if he would like me to remind him, I would.  Have you asked your son if he&#39;d like you to help him set limits on his TV viewing?  Have you discussed with him your specific concerns with the TV shows he chooses?  If you&#39;ve done both of these and he still chooses those shows, and tells you he doesn&#39;t want you to limit him, then I&#39;d suggest you just back off the TV thing for a while and let him come to his own conclusions. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia -- who has recently reached a new plateau in my own personal peace with what my kids watch on TV.....<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLuggage?

Your fear  <br/>\nis saying that you don&#39;t think that he can handle it and that it will  <br/>\nbe pure luck if he isn&#39;t affected. And his &quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t let  <br/>\nme,&quot; is an indication that you&#39;ve managed to whittle away at his own  <br/>\ntrust in himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than telling him it&#39;s something to fear and making him feel  <br/>\nsmall and helpless and someone who needs his mommy to turn the TV off  <br/>\nfor him, help him gain power over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him a big hug. Tell him you were wrong. Tell him you *do* trust  <br/>\nhim. Tell him you let your fears overwhelm you so that you saw him as  <br/>\nless powerful than the TV and that you&#39;re sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him information. You could suggest a mental check in the  <br/>\nmornings to see if he&#39;d like to do something special to counteract  <br/>\nanything that saw last night. It might be talking about it. It might  <br/>\nbe doing something completely different, like a happy movie or happy  <br/>\nmusic or dancing. Give him tools he can use throughout his life to  <br/>\ncombat depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo invite him to talk about the programs -- *without* the fear that  <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s telling you is leading down a dark path.  If a friend of  <br/>\nhis who seemed happy was talking about programs he&#39;d seen you  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be filtering it through fear that he&#39;s headed for  <br/>\ndepression. So sometimes it&#39;s easier to look at our children as  <br/>\nthough they&#39;re someone else&#39;s kids who are sharing stuff that  <br/>\ninterests them  than a son that instinct tells you you need to  <br/>\nprotect from the scary world.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Trust* him. But don&#39;t take trust to mean ignore him. Invite him to  <br/>\nshare with you. Check in with yourself! Ask yourself if you are  <br/>\nacting as someone he would want to share with or are you becoming  <br/>\nsomeone he&#39;ll want to hide things from. (If you&#39;ve warned him that he  <br/>\ncould sink into depression and he does because he wanted to test his  <br/>\nlimits and he can feel changes in him but the only technique you&#39;ve  <br/>\ngiven him is to turn the TV off, then he&#39;s less likely to go to you  <br/>\nfor help.) Your fear could make him *act* as though he has no  <br/>\nproblems because he doesn&#39;t want to feed your fears. Embrace the fact  <br/>\nthat he still trusts you enough to talk about the programs! :-)  <br/>\nNurture that. *Be* open. *Be* someone he&#39;ll want to share with. *Be*  <br/>\nsomeone he&#39;ll want to come to when something bothers him (because  <br/>\nright now your fears and discussions on what you&#39;d rather he do are  <br/>\nsetting up the opposite.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKids *can* whack their thumb with a hammer.

I guess at the root of it, though, is whether limits are ever appropriate, and when? And can a child say that they want to do something, but hope that you won&#39;t allow it? I will say at the outset that everything below has been discussed at length with my son. Our dialog has been extensive but has not lead to a resolution. I&#39;d like to simplify my question, and invite responses to that simpler question. Below that I&#39;d like to elaborate on the questions more as they pertain to my particular child, for those with the patience or time to read that!<br/>\n   Here goes: The simple question/problem is this: my 13 yo ds has been wanting to watch TV alone from about 8:00 pm until 5:00 am for about 10 weeks. He occasionally wakes me up to watch a movie or look at something on the internet, but mostly he prefers to be alone. I have seen that some of the shows don&#39;t seem very good to me. I have at times brought up concerns, when he has (rarely) let me watch with him. But last night there was a reason he watched several hours with me nearby. The shows seemed to me...hideous. I choose that word very carefully. They were to me violent, bleak, hopeless and soul-numbing. They filled me with sorrow for their makers and for their audience, which I was so sorry to find included my son. I am not naive; I am 46, have been through much in life and I work in an ER. I am not that easily shocked. I doubt that my feelings were unreasonable. I shared my sorrow with him. Our discussion went on for a while, but no agreement could be reached. He at<br/>\n first thought that because I feared that these shows, seen so frequently, could harm him, that I lacked trust in him. I went over again my belief that frequent exposure to anything will begin to influence almost anybody. He began to say..&quot;Maybe you shouldn&#39;t allow this.&quot; But he did not say that he wouldn&#39;t watch it again. I said that I was so torn...that I did not want to control what he watched. I asked him how he&#39;d feel if I disallowed these shows, and the words felt alien in my mouth. But a part of me felt almost like he was looking for a firmer guide. This feeling is very concerning to me, like my intuition is telling me that he wants me to forbid these shows. So...I&#39;d love opinions on this case in particular and on the question about limits in general. Thanks you!!<br/>\n    Although I planned to continue here, this is enough for now. Thanks again to anyone willing to comment!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23696,"nextTopicId":23789}}
