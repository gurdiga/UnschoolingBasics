Both of my kids aren&#39;t the athletic, popular <br/>\n&gt; types, they both tend to march to the beat of a different drummer <br/>\ndue to <br/>\n&gt; bipolar disorder, and tend to get singled out by other kids in the <br/>\n&gt; school environment. I had zero cooperation from the school system <br/>\nback <br/>\n&gt; then with my daughter because their whole attitude was you had to <br/>\nlet <br/>\n&gt; kids work things like that out amongst themselves. Since Columbine, <br/>\n&gt; attitudes have changed and my son&#39;s school has been quicker to stop <br/>\nthe <br/>\n&gt; harassment,  but have not put an end to it. Other kids know my son <br/>\nis <br/>\n&gt; quick to come to tears and seem to like to try their best to push <br/>\nhis <br/>\n&gt; buttons. His grades have been falling steadily over the past few <br/>\nyears <br/>\n&gt; due to this. He had an IQ test early on and he is brilliant, like <br/>\nmy <br/>\n&gt; daughter, but can&#39;t get past the reams of homework on his bad days, <br/>\nand <br/>\n&gt; is constantly in turmoil due to the bipolar disorder and <br/>\nenvironment at <br/>\n&gt; school. He is getting more depressed and I feel like the school <br/>\nsystem <br/>\n&gt; is just making his symptoms worse.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I allowed my daughter to be in charge of whether or not she was <br/>\n&gt; homeschooled and eventually she decided she wanted to go back and I <br/>\n&gt; honored that choice. She went back much better able to do the <br/>\nschool <br/>\n&gt; work and much better able to handle things other kids threw at her. <br/>\nShe <br/>\n&gt; is now 25 and attending a community college.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I kind of unschooled my daughter for the years I had her at home, <br/>\nin <br/>\n&gt; that I didn&#39;t have a super structured curriculum, but would really <br/>\n&gt; prefer to unschool my son completely. I&#39;m just wondering if there <br/>\nare <br/>\n&gt; others out there who have gone from years of structured public <br/>\nschooling <br/>\n&gt; to unschooling and how hard was it to make the switch? Should I <br/>\nexpect <br/>\n&gt; my son to go through a period of not wanting to do anything at all, <br/>\nor <br/>\n&gt; should I try and just do things that pique his interest and let it <br/>\ngo <br/>\n&gt; from there?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Another question for anyone out there who went from public schools <br/>\nto <br/>\n&gt; unschooling is, should I wait until the beginning of a school year <br/>\nto do <br/>\n&gt; it, or just yank him out in the middle of a year? With my daughter, <br/>\nwe <br/>\n&gt; started at the beginning of a new school year, so there were no <br/>\nproblems <br/>\n&gt; really, other than some nasty comments from the principal of the <br/>\nschool <br/>\n&gt; she was supposed to be going to. I work seasonally, so can&#39;t really <br/>\ntake <br/>\n&gt; him out just yet, due to not having anyone to be here at home with <br/>\nhim. <br/>\n&gt; My work ends in November though, so I would be able to do it at <br/>\nthat <br/>\n&gt; time, then make arrangements by next summer before work picks up <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point it really is a matter of his mental health that is so <br/>\nmuch <br/>\n&gt; of an issue. I don&#39;t know if he can handle this kind of stress much <br/>\n&gt; longer. I have talked with him openly of course, and want it to be <br/>\nhis <br/>\n&gt; decision like it was with my daughter to stay or leave the PS <br/>\nsystem and <br/>\n&gt; he is all ready to give it a whirl, but I&#39;m just not sure if I <br/>\nshould go <br/>\n&gt; the unschooled route or the more structured route.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening if nothing else!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cheers,<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":323487745,"authorName":"Julie","from":"Julie &lt;jsweevil2@...&gt;","profile":"jsweevil1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to groups","postDate":"1189721526","msgId":26188,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RTlCNUI2LjMwNTAyQGVtYmFycW1haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI2NTUxOC44NDkyNy5xbUB3ZWI2MDgxMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDI2NTUxOC44NDkyNy5xbUB3ZWI2MDgxMi5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26160,"nextInTopic":26205,"prevInTime":26187,"nextInTime":26189,"topicId":26157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for the input Vanessa!

I think I am going to go ahead and take <br/>\nhim out after the Christmas holidays.

I definitely won&#39;t wait till the end of the school <br/>\nyear, it&#39;s just getting really bad for him mentally staying in school. <br/>\nIf I can get my ducks in order I may even do it after the Thanksgiving <br/>\nholiday break.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was actually shocked and amazed at some of the reactions I have gotten <br/>\nfrom family members over this. I was expecting some friction from some, <br/>\njust because of the whole homeschooling thing, not to even mention <br/>\nunschooling, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My husband was quick <br/>\nto agree to taking him out of school, knowing what kind of difficulties <br/>\nhe has been having lately. The biggest surprise was my sister though. <br/>\nShe is normally a bit less open minded, yet when I started talking to <br/>\nher about his troubles, she actually brought it up; &quot;Maybe you should <br/>\nhomeschool him&quot;. She balked a bit when I took my daughter out of school <br/>\nyears ago, but this time she really has been very supportive, and <br/>\nalthough she was a bit skeptical about the unschooling idea at first <br/>\nthis time, she really seemed to see the point of it after a bit of <br/>\ndiscussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be extremely nice this go around having it being a bit more <br/>\naccepted by close family members and friends than it was back in the <br/>\nearly 90s when I did it before.

Although his grades didn&#39;t suffer,<br/>\n&gt; he was always bullied.  Like you, we tried going<br/>\n&gt; through all of the channels to get these problems<br/>\n&gt; taken care of, and nothing worked.  He only liked art,<br/>\n&gt; and only liked gym, because of the teacher.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My son isn&#39;t athletic, and had few friends.  His best<br/>\n&gt; friend, moved right during Easter break, so he lost<br/>\n&gt; his last friend then.  He had been an &quot;easy&quot; target,<br/>\n&gt; because he is a big kid, and at 11, he&#39;s almost as<br/>\n&gt; tall as I am.(and I am 5&#39;9&quot;)  He was always the smart<br/>\n&gt; kid.  The school thought he needed help, so we agreed<br/>\n&gt; to have his speech tested.  When he was tested, he<br/>\n&gt; tested above his age, on most of them way above his<br/>\n&gt; age.  He was also labeled as someone with high anxiety<br/>\n&gt; disorder (which I don&#39;t believe.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wanted to pull him out before school ended, but<br/>\n&gt; hubby wanted both kids to finish out the year.  My<br/>\n&gt; daughter was also bullied, but not to the same extent.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They say hind sight is 20/20, and looking back now, I<br/>\n&gt; wish I would&#39;ve pulled them out when I wanted to. <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been through the depression (if that&#39;s what it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; called) with him.  One summer he told my<br/>\n&gt; parents--what&#39;s the point in going on.  He was in<br/>\n&gt; second grade then.  He had a really good teacher in<br/>\n&gt; 3rd grade, but the bullying continued, and nothing was<br/>\n&gt; done about it.  By the time he hit fourth grade, it<br/>\n&gt; was a nightmare.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t wait.  I would pull your son out of public<br/>\n&gt; school, when it is possible for you.  We went from<br/>\n&gt; public school to unschooling right away.  We did<br/>\n&gt; deschool, and sometimes I feel that we still are. <br/>\n&gt; There is still alot of anger in me and my children,<br/>\n&gt; although it has lessened some.  Unschooling is so<br/>\n&gt; awesome for us.  We are able to do alot of things that<br/>\n&gt; you just don&#39;t get in public schools.  It&#39;s about<br/>\n&gt; living life, and learning from those experiences.  We<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t done anything schooly.  We have touched on the<br/>\n&gt; subjects that my kids talk about, and we learn<br/>\n&gt; together.  We chose unschooling, because it is what<br/>\n&gt; fits our family the best.  It&#39;s taken some time to get<br/>\n&gt; used to it, but I enjoy my kids, and love the things<br/>\n&gt; that they are interested in.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Public school messed with them alot.  We have battled<br/>\n&gt; with the principal and the teachers so many times, and<br/>\n&gt; even had the principal lie to me, right to my face. <br/>\n&gt; We didn&#39;t feel comfortable leaving the kids in a place<br/>\n&gt; where they couldn&#39;t trust the teachers, and we<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t trust the principal.  Now that we have been<br/>\n&gt; doing this for a year, it is so amazing the changes we<br/>\n&gt; see in our kids.  They are more relaxed and happier,<br/>\n&gt; and they are starting to get their self-confidence<br/>\n&gt; back.  It has changed them so much for the better.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hope this helps some.  Enjoy the time you can spend<br/>\n&gt; with your son, and pull him out as soon as you can. <br/>\n&gt; It really makes a difference, and you&#39;ll be glad you<br/>\n&gt; did.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --- Julie &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsweevil2@...\">jsweevil2@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi all, Just wanted to introduce myself and maybe<br/>\n&gt;&gt; get a bit of input <br/>\n&gt;&gt; about my situation.

She went back much better able<br/>\n&gt; to do the school <br/>\n&gt; work and much better able to handle things other<br/>\n&gt; kids threw at her.

I have a son who is 11 years old and is currently <br/>\nenrolled in public school. He is having a lot of difficulty in both <br/>\nacademics and in the social life there.  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling as <br/>\nI homeschooled my daughter for three years between 6th and 9th grades. I <br/>\ntook her out for the same reason I am thinking about taking my son out, <br/>\nbullying by other students, and low academics, not because they can&#39;t <br/>\nexcel, but because the constant pressures of other kids in the school <br/>\ncauses them to hate the whole school experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was bullied constantly, and had low scores because she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t concentrate. Both of my kids aren&#39;t the athletic, popular <br/>\ntypes, they both tend to march to the beat of a different drummer due to <br/>\nbipolar disorder, and tend to get singled out by other kids in the <br/>\nschool environment. I had zero cooperation from the school system back <br/>\nthen with my daughter because their whole attitude was you had to let <br/>\nkids work things like that out amongst themselves.

He is getting more depressed and I feel like the school system <br/>\nis just making his symptoms worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI allowed my daughter to be in charge of whether or not she was <br/>\nhomeschooled and eventually she decided she wanted to go back and I <br/>\nhonored that choice.
