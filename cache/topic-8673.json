I feel guilty for working, but it is necessary, at least for the time being.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So, time is valuable.  I&#39;m off one day during the week and Sundays.  The younger kids are who I worry about most.  Of course I get the regular comments, &quot;when do you find time to home school?&quot;  MIL is the worst. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I actually work two jobs right now.  I&#39;m putting in a two week notice to one job really soon.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Like I said time is very valuable for us.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There have been wonderful ideas about strewing recently.  How about strewing when a mom isn&#39;t home during the day??  Do I leave lists?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My New Year&#39;s resolution is to really spend quality time with my children when I&#39;m available.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Be it, watching tv with them, their games, sitting with them in their rooms.  One daughter has specifically asked if I would visit her in her room.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;d like to be able to buy time....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  It may be possible to only work three days a week soon.
