He&#39;ll be covered in Albuquerque, but<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to figure out somewhere near Medford or Redding, maybe<br/>\nBakersfield....places near I-5 and then somewhere off 40 in AZ<br/>\n(perhaps near Flagstaff?).<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you write me if you&#39;re willing to put an unschooling Dad up for<br/>\na night?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10003,"nextTopicId":10051}}
