We have seven children and three grandchildren.  We <br/>\ngraduated four out of our local high school.  Our youngest, almost <br/>\n13, has been home most of the time.  The next two oldest, 15 and <br/>\nalmost 17, just came home within the last year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 17 year old is our youngest daughter.  She was in the  local <br/>\ncharter school when we were finally able to bring her home.  It was <br/>\njust a year in December.  During that time a lot happened.  We had <br/>\nthree grandchildren.  I helped with two of them full-time.  I just <br/>\nstopped in January.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring this year we have done some interesting things, but time was <br/>\nlimited due to caring for new babies.  The kids have done a lot of <br/>\ndeschooling.  I was excited about this month and being able to <br/>\ndedicate my time 100 percent to my children.  I spent the first two <br/>\nweeks sick.  So, we&#39;re just getting on with our life this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the wee hours of the morning and I am typing this email because <br/>\nI got up for the early morning &quot;potty run&quot; and discovered a letter <br/>\ntaped to my door knob from our 17 year old daughter.  She wants to go <br/>\nback to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the letter she is stating social reasons of why she wanted to come <br/>\nhome to begin with.  There are many reasons I know of why she should <br/>\nnot return to school.  Unschooling is about freedom, and I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto force her to do anything.  BUT, I would like her to continue in <br/>\nfreedom and am going to need to be on my toes.  My husband is still <br/>\nwarming to the kids&#39; new lifestyle.  We are just starting to get into <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she was in PS she should have been going into 11th grade.  She <br/>\nwould have failed and stayed in 10th.  Really it was 9th/10th.  If <br/>\nshe were to go back to school she would only be in 9th grade at <br/>\nalmost 18.  It&#39;s just not practical.  In her letter she states that <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t feel that she can learn what she needs to know at home.  <br/>\nShe certainly won&#39;t learn it at PS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook with her.  She wasn&#39;t <br/>\ninto it.  Honestly, her friends all go to PS.  She has NO HS <br/>\nfriends.  In my mind this was the year of opportunity for her.  I&#39;ve <br/>\noffered community ed classes in things she&#39;s interested in.  She <br/>\nturned it down.  She really has not set or achieved any goals since <br/>\nshe&#39;s been home.  I&#39;ve not seen a dedication to anything.  No <br/>\npassion.  It&#39;s been concerning to me, but I was looking to provide a <br/>\nlot of opportunity this year.  By this I don&#39;t mean educational <br/>\nlooking things.  I mean real life opportunities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my mind we were just getting ready to get on with life.  Any <br/>\nsuggestions as to the direction to go here.  What would you do if it <br/>\nwere your child?  I know going back to traditional PS is not really a <br/>\nviable option.  There are so many more options available to her.  She <br/>\ncould go to college if she wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nALL input welcome and desired.
