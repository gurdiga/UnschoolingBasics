I hear a lot of pain though reading your words and <br/>\ntruthfully I can&#39;t imagine the hardship you have experienced.  <br/>\nMy input here is spiritual in nature and I pray it helps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you shift your perception of your current situation (if you <br/>\nhaven&#39;t already tried)?  Whether or not it&#39;s fair, you&#39;re life has <br/>\nbeen totally turned upside down.  That&#39;s reality- you can&#39;t dispute <br/>\nit.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, the only choice you have is how you choose to respond to the <br/>\nchallenge.  Is it possible for you to switch your thought pattern to <br/>\nan attitude of Gratitude? Can you be thankful for your health, your <br/>\nchildren&#39;s safety or the fact that while it&#39;s not ideal, you do have <br/>\na roof over your head?  Can you and your children try to uncover any <br/>\nhidden blessings in your situation? You can use this experience as a <br/>\nhuge learning lesson, if you redirect them and teach them to decide <br/>\nto only focus on the positive.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if they are sad about their old home, you can reassure <br/>\nthem that you understand their pain.  And while you can&#39;t change <br/>\nwhat happened in the past you can decide to rise to the occasion.  <br/>\nNothing in life is guaranteed so they can decide to look forward to <br/>\ntheir bright future or they can suffer thinking about all they&#39;ve <br/>\nlost. The choice is theirs and yours.     <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a painful time for you and I know that home schooling <br/>\ncan be very demanding.  I urge you to be kind to yourself.  Can you <br/>\nspend some of your free time, even 15 mins. A day in the early Am <br/>\nreading and doing some inner-work?  I suggest Gary Zikav or Wayne <br/>\nDyer, I have learned a great deal from these writers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I better go.  I hope you choose not to take offense to any of <br/>\nmy suggestions.  My children and I wish you many Blessings and a <br/>\nbeautiful future.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12479,"nextTopicId":12483}}
