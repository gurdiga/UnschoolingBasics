Both of my oldest two <br/>\n(the ones that went to public school) are very resistant to anything <br/>\nthat they consider &quot;school&quot;  This includes reading anything, even <br/>\ncomic type books, unless forced to do so.  They would spend all day, <br/>\nevery day, in front of the the TV, computer or playstation if they <br/>\nwere allowed to.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would encourage you to go to www.sandradodd.com and browse all the<br/>\nunschooling essays, articles and collections of interesting things people<br/>\nhave posted on various forums over the last few years. There is a particular<br/>\nsection about the value of all of these electronic media to unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you say &quot;unless forced to do so&quot; I must assume that sometimes your<br/>\ncomfort level makes you force some other activity, including reading, on<br/>\nthem. Many people suggest instead of doing that, if you get involved in what<br/>\nthey are watching, playing or investigating, you will start to see the value<br/>\nof it, or at least gain an insight into what *they* find great about the<br/>\ngame or program. You may also discover the huge amount of reading and<br/>\nmath/logic that goes into many computer games. Even so, if you don&#39;t try to<br/>\nlimit their time for arbitrary (ie your concerns about them not doing<br/>\nsomething &quot;educational&quot;) reasons, you will find that it is not really &quot;all<br/>\nday&quot;, and that even if it is, it won&#39;t be that way forever. If it really is<br/>\nall day, then you know that you may have a future game designer or<br/>\nprogrammer in your house. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;None of my children has any interest in anything that requires that <br/>\nwe get in the car to get to it.  In other words - they want to stay <br/>\non our property.  We are in a somewhat rural setting - only other <br/>\nsingle family dwellings anywhere on our street.  There is nothing <br/>\nwithin walking distance of us.  This makes me very concerned about <br/>\nunschooling for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that if you have been home schooling with some kind of curriculum<br/>\nor parent directed educational goals since 2001, you are all still in the<br/>\nprocess of deschooling. In moving into unschooling, it is like playing<br/>\n&quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;. If you push (uninvited) a schoolish activity or make a<br/>\ncriticism of the decompression activity that the boys are doing, even once,<br/>\nyou slide down the snake to, if not the very beginning, some way back. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of us city dwellers are now salivating with envy, btw. Jayn goes<br/>\nthrough periods when she is very much a homebody. It seems to be in response<br/>\nto a lot of outside pressures and activities in the days prior. In your<br/>\ncase, I really would think about whether in part it is an ongoing reaction<br/>\nto the control of their activities in the past. Isn&#39;t it better to have a<br/>\nreal reason for them to want to leave the house - like an interest they can<br/>\nonly fully pursue elsewhere - rather than trying to get them out just for<br/>\nthe sake of it? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is not a reaction, but you really do have a couple or more of real<br/>\nhomeloving kids, then unschooling allows you to honor that facet of their<br/>\npersonality, without needing to drag them out the door. If you are worried<br/>\nabout friends, then invite people over sometimes.   <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Also, the youngest three are still non-readers, including the 7.5 yr <br/>\nold.  They have not shown any desire to learn to read at all.  They <br/>\nhave all been read to since they were several months old and the <br/>\nyoungest 3 still get bedtime stories at the very least, but the 6 and <br/>\n7.5 yr olds are getting resistant even to being read to.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if they sense the hidden agenda in your reading to them - ie you<br/>\nhave a goal that they learn to read by some age/time and are apparently<br/>\nstarting to get anxious about it. Kids pick this up, even if you think you<br/>\nare doing a great job of hiding it. The only way not to have to hide anxiety<br/>\nis genuinely not to have any. Again at Sandra&#39;s site, and the message boards<br/>\nat Unschooling.com there are many stories of &quot;later&quot; readers.  <br/>\nWho is choosing the reading material for the three younger ones? Are the 6<br/>\nand 7.5 year olds being seen as a homogenous pair, or do they get to have<br/>\ntheir own separate interests catered to in the reading material? <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Can this really be a good way for my family to learn?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, and to live. Our life is wonderful, and I have every expectation of it<br/>\ngetting even better as Jayn gets older. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
