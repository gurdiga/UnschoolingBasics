I am a cerified waldorf class <br/>\nteacher . I&#39;ve read a lot of steiner during my immersion , probably <br/>\n200 of his 6000 published works, a harah for the free steiner <br/>\nl;ending libray , nice system. These ideas really are antithetical <br/>\non the most part to the philoshophy of unschooling. Letting the baby <br/>\ncry and stopping breast feeding at 1 , I&#39;m sorry its not connected <br/>\nenough about real present relationships and the ability to <br/>\nunderstand and engage at the moment with another human being. It is <br/>\nfull of dogma and rules, now when i say it I mean the waldorf <br/>\nideology, more than steiner himself. people have taken his ideas and <br/>\nformed rigid prescriptions, steiner himself on his death bed felt <br/>\nthat his whole educational philoshophy was wrong and he would do it <br/>\nvery differently, ah , death left that as an un 0- elucidated <br/>\nstatement. steiner felt there should be no formal education till the <br/>\nage of 12, and the school was a compromise toward the laws of the <br/>\ngerman govt, but visit a school , it is certainly a better version <br/>\nof school, but it borrows so much and doesn&#39;t penetrate to the heart <br/>\nof relationship enougjh. this phys ed spatial dynamics is excellent, <br/>\nand the art , cool , but it is really way too creul a system, though <br/>\nit rests so much on the relationship of the class teacher with the <br/>\nstudents. trust me the waldorf ideas will lead you to a judgemental <br/>\nplace of right and wrong and not really challenge you to explore the <br/>\nrelationship, and the true learning from emotional experience that <br/>\nunschooling offers to you and your child<br/>\npatrick</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23675,"nextTopicId":23955}}
