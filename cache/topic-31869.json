People get <br/>\nangry.  People are, basically, people, and less than perfect.  It <br/>\nhappens.  I want my children to understand that and be okay with the <br/>\nfact that no one (themselves included) is perfect all the time.  I <br/>\nknow that when one of my children does something less than perfect I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want them feeling badly about themselves all day.  We make <br/>\nmistakes.  We apologize openly and honestly.  We move on.  We try to <br/>\nhandle situations better the next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, sure, doing the kinds of things that help reduce stress is great, <br/>\nand doing the kind of mental preparation that helps keep us from <br/>\nreacting negatively in the moment is also great, but apologies and <br/>\nunderstanding that we all mess up from time to time and forgiving <br/>\neach other is great too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Kendrah Nilsestuen <br/>\n&lt;carebear-79@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; **UGGGGHHHHHH I have cried off and on all day.

Nothing makes<br/>\nme feel worse then doing something  stupid to make my sons cry, just because<br/>\nI was stressed.  Thankfully they have really short memories, even is we<br/>\ndon&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife also travels some for work.  The stress really builds because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get any down time.  I have since learned that I really really REALLY<br/>\nneeded to find a way to release that stress when she is gone.  Part of my<br/>\nproblem too, was just adjusting to being home and not working.  I was a<br/>\nworkaholic in my former life.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill have trouble believing how things turned out, but I love being home.<br/>\nMy youngest took his first steps today without support. I got to see that<br/>\nand be home for it.  How cool it that!! Okay sorry I digress ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a list like this a while back in one of my wifes parenting magizines<br/>\nshe reads and it really helped me. Of course the list was geared towards<br/>\nstay at home moms and not practical for me so I have developed my own list.<br/>\nThese are a few things that I do to release some stress<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps you some or gives you some ideas.  Hang in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I get a time out and we watch Star Trek.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) My sister comes for a visit<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I play Guitar Hero and they all dance while I play<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Video game really really help me calm down, so after the kids go to bed I<br/>\ndo this first, before doing any work. I will be doing dishes tomorrow anyway<br/>\nso its not like they are going there. I am sort of a reformed neat freak.<br/>\nFind something that relaxes you.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) I once wrote a LONG love letter to my wife and emailed it to her while<br/>\nshe was on travel.  It was like we were dating all over again and she got a<br/>\nbig kick out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Watch a Laurie Berkin DVD. Some of the songs have motions or we made some<br/>\nup.  We will just dance around and sing.  This is great for bad weather.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) We go to the park and I play some basketball while they ride their toys<br/>\naround the court. Exercise always helps reduce the stress, but its hard to<br/>\ndo when I am by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) I go move into my mom&#39;s house for a bit sometimes.  I know my friend<br/>\nhighly recommends this as its the way she copes with having her husband<br/>\ngone.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) I get some babysitting if nothing else. I trade with another stay at home<br/>\nmom. We both get desperate to get out.  I also have a retired friend from<br/>\nchurch who is like a third grandma to my kids who comes over for a few<br/>\nhours.  Then I usually hit the coffee shop or Barnes and Nobles for a couple<br/>\nof hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) We have a movie night.  We have been watching  My Neighbor Totoro and<br/>\neating some special snacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there Chrissy<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nChad<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Apr 14, 2008 at 10:32 PM, Chrissy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:chrissymomto2@...\">chrissymomto2@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   How do you do it???
