It really hit home with me too.  I have just <br/>\ntoday got my copy of &quot;The Book of Learning & Forgetting&quot; in the post <br/>\nand am snuggled up by the fire (yep, its winter here!) reading it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts great, and I guess your post and the book are singing the same <br/>\nsong.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can honestly feel the schooly layers peeling off me, the fear <br/>\nstarting to drop away.  It is such a relief to feel this process <br/>\nrealy happening as it has been pretty stressful over the past 9 <br/>\nmonths since we got out/became free - to hold all that stuff, the <br/>\nworry, the parental panuc attacks etc etc that happen when you step <br/>\noutside of &quot;the system&quot;.  I had told myself that it was happening, <br/>\nbtu I think I was tryign to will myselfl to stop worrying (HA!). Now <br/>\nI can really feel it happening, I know this is for real. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed that I don&#39;t feel so defensive anymore, like I have to <br/>\njustify what I / we do during the day to anyone.  I am almost coming <br/>\nto enjoy their mystified looks when I say that we do no formal <br/>\ntextbook work or bookwork.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts been 9 months since we left school... - that seems kind of <br/>\nsignificant in a way...not unlike a pregnancy.  Perhaps I have <br/>\nfinally given birth to my inner unschooler!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - thanks for writing what you did.
