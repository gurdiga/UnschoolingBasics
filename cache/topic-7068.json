She did come back..<br/>\nShe said she was concerned about Jio (we had told the school he was <br/>\nsick). She said she came not for the school. That when she came the <br/>\nfirst time Jio told her that I was HS&#39;ing him (the school aparently <br/>\nhadn&#39;t gotten the letter yet). She said she was concerned &quot;I&quot; could <br/>\nhandle that and that that was &quot;alot&quot; of work for me. She also said <br/>\nthat Jio was doing good in her class and asked if there was anything <br/>\nthe school could do to keep Jio there...possibly smaller class...no <br/>\nhomework..etc...<br/>\nI told her I didn&#39;t think so. That we thought this would be best for <br/>\nJio right now and that if in the future it doesn&#39;t work out or he <br/>\nwants to go back to PS that the option is always there for him. I <br/>\ntold her that I though that the school was good and that so were the <br/>\nteachers. I told her it was Jio and his ways that didn&#39;t fit.

She told Jio he could <br/>\nwrite her a letter and let her know how he&#39;s doing and that if we <br/>\nwanted (and it was ok with the school) she could give Jio his <br/>\nworkbooks if he wanted to do them. I told her if he wanted them he <br/>\ncould ask her for them. I didn&#39;t feel I should get in the fact that <br/>\nwe were really &quot;unschooling&quot;.
