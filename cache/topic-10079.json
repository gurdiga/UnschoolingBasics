I checked my child out of school early frequently to take her to our community theatre, childrens museum, zoo, etc. All the check-outs were during the last part of the day and she was skipping second recess and naptime. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Excuse my sarcasm ...guess it dosent matter we are free! free! free! lol<br/>\n   <br/>\n  This may sound weird to some but Im glowing. If it wernt for this law problem I wouldnt have forced Courtney to quit but Ive just enjoyed so many little things today. For example Courtney playing with her little sister instead of little sister asking where Courtney was every half hour. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n <br/>\n What are the most popular cars?
