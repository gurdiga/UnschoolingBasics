Being naturally curious about the world, those interests lead them to learn a whooooooole lot about the world, just in a different way than they would if they were in school. There&#39;s no need to set out a learning plan - kids love to learn. Kids learn via play (that&#39;s what its &quot;for&quot;) so there&#39;s no need to worry if kids play all day long - that&#39;s what they&#39;re designed to do, and how they&#39;re designed to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers spend time hanging out with our kids, playing with them, talking with them. We invite them to participate in our daily adult work - household tasks, projects, hobbies - and we&#39;re happy to be included in our kids work (playing!). We offer new and fun things whenever we find something our kids might like, to keep things fresh and interesting and keep their lives big and wonderful.
