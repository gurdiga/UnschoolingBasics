Actually from records dating back for <br/>\nseveral<br/>\n  mellinia (particularly from Asia, Europe and the Middle East), <br/>\nchildren once<br/>\n  they became old enough to follow mom around became workers, especially <br/>\nin<br/>\n  the middle and lower classes. Playtime was something that everyone <br/>\ndid, not<br/>\n just children and it was different from what we see as playtime today.<br/>\n  Before children could follow mom on their own they were worn or <br/>\ncarried by<br/>\n  their mothers or older siblings or other family members or they were <br/>\nleft<br/>\n cradled (or worse swaddled). Children as young as 2 or 3 years old were<br/>\n already helping with tasks that they could do. Modern children have far<br/>\n  more playtime than their ancient and medieval counterparts. And when <br/>\nthey<br/>\n  did play in groups the children in the group could vary in age from <br/>\ntoddlers<br/>\n  to pre-teens. I stand by what I say that playgroups as we do them <br/>\ntoday are<br/>\n unatural!<br/>\n<br/>\n ---=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the news last night (which I watched to find out the updates on <br/>\nBarbaro!), one of the reporters was in Africa. With Bono.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He had footage (and this really sad voice) about a seven year old girl <br/>\nwho *had* to fix her family food every day---ground up meal made into a <br/>\ndough and then fried. He made it out to be soooo terrible (not the <br/>\nfood, but the idea that the child cooked). That the child had &quot;old&quot; <br/>\neyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, she may have a terrible, terrible life. But all we got was that <br/>\none shot of her making supper. &quot;Just think,&quot; he said, &quot;of what <br/>\n*American* girls at seven would be doing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  But I was thinking that if *that* was the worst of it, it&#39;s not that <br/>\ndamned bad!<br/>\n<br/>\n  She was doing real work that made a difference in her life---and her <br/>\nfamily&#39;s. She was certainly capable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It just made me think about how we impose our western ideals and <br/>\nlifestyles onto others. Children in other cultures often contribute to <br/>\nthe working household. They want to be a part of it and feel needed. To <br/>\n*me* this child was making a difference. I bet she was proud of what <br/>\nshe did.<br/>\n<br/>\n The reporter made it out to be horrible that she would have to!<br/>\n<br/>\n Different cultures...<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n I would be asking why the child didn&#39;t enjoy the activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;d ask the child why too.

Often<br/>\nwe get the same answer (yes or no) when we ask the question in the<br/>\nopposite direction, which is our first step to making sure he<br/>\nunderstood what we were asking (e.g. &quot;Do you want to go out?&quot;<br/>\nfollowed by &quot;Do you want to stay home?&quot; or the like, whatever options<br/>\nwe see as being available).  Rewording the question (or looking for<br/>\nmore options) until we get a differentiation between the options is a<br/>\nchallenge, sometimes, but we don&#39;t feel we&#39;ve got a true answer until<br/>\nwe do get a differentiation in the answer (which may be the same<br/>\nanswer, but with a different tone... difficult to explain).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with our son, his way of saying yes, a very excited &quot;AH-ha&quot;, is<br/>\nsomething we&#39;ve all at times found amusing.  His no&#39;s are more shaking<br/>\nhis head and a subtle &quot;uh-uh&quot;, used most often when we ask him to<br/>\nbring something to us.  So, he will often &quot;say&quot; yes when he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessarily mean it because he knows we love his manner of saying yes.<br/>\n So, we&#39;ve made it (by our early responses) more necessary to<br/>\ndouble-check his answer to make sure he knows what we&#39;re asking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible that your child had a great time and it&#39;s possible they<br/>\ntruly didn&#39;t.  I&#39;d certainly want to explore the question more and not<br/>\nleave it at one question/answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 21, 2006, at 5:47 PM, Misty Felner wrote:<br/>\n&gt; if a 2.5 yo goes somewhere and appears to have a good time,<br/>\n&gt; plays, laughs, smiles, etc.  Then later you ask if they had a good<br/>\n&gt; time and<br/>\n&gt; they respond no.

I think playgroups with children all the same age are unnatural,<br/>\n&gt; just<br/>\n&gt; as classrooms are.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s speculative history.  Actually from records dating back for several<br/>\nmellinia (particularly from Asia, Europe and the Middle East), children once<br/>\nthey became old enough to follow mom around became workers, especially in<br/>\nthe middle and lower classes.  Playtime was something that everyone did, not<br/>\njust children and it was different from what we see as playtime today.<br/>\nBefore children could follow mom on their own they were worn or carried by<br/>\ntheir mothers or older siblings or other family members or they were left<br/>\ncradled (or worse swaddled).  Children as young as 2 or 3 years old were<br/>\nalready helping with tasks that they could do.  Modern children have far<br/>\nmore playtime than their ancient and medieval counterparts.  And when they<br/>\ndid play in groups the children in the group could vary in age from toddlers<br/>\nto pre-teens. I stand by what I say that playgroups as we do them today are<br/>\nunatural!<br/>\n<br/>\nA new question, if a 2.5 yo goes somewhere and appears to have a good time,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; plays, laughs, smiles, etc.  Then later you ask if they had a good time<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; they respond no.  Do you believe they enjoyed it and should continue in<br/>\n&gt; excursions or get togethers of this kind or should they be discontinued?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would be asking why the child didn&#39;t enjoy the activity.  And perhaps in a<br/>\nchild&#39;s eye, being home with mom is WAY more fun than playgroup.  Perhas the<br/>\nchild doesn&#39;t like being around lots of other people, despite seeming to<br/>\nhave a good time.  I have a child who really doesn&#39;t care for large groups.<br/>\nShe likes more intimate relationships with one or two people.  She always<br/>\nonly has one or two true friends which has been a problem in the past when a<br/>\nfriend has had to move away or gotten interests elsewhere and quit<br/>\nsocialising with her.  She&#39;ll go to our weekly playgroups and appears to<br/>\nhave a good time, but really would prefer if she could have a friend over to<br/>\nher house or go over to a friend&#39;s house where it is just the two of them<br/>\nthan go to a place where there are tons of other people.  At 2.5 she may not<br/>\nbe able to voice why she does or doesn&#39;t like something.  I would give her<br/>\nthe option of whether to go or not.  &quot;It&#39;s playgroup day.  Do you want to go<br/>\nor is there something else you would prefer to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"katherand2003","from":"&quot;katherand2003&quot; &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Digest Number 941- 2yo play","postDate":"1148258951","msgId":13515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0cjFxNyttODk0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13509,"nextInTopic":13526,"prevInTime":13514,"nextInTime":13516,"topicId":13509,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ds does this too.
