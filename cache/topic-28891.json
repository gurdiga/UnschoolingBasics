This is really <br/>\nhuge - I *so* appreciate that you did this. My daughter was looking <br/>\nforward to the conference for months! Also the price!! Seriously, <br/>\nwhat a *fantastic* deal! Two days of great speakers, a canvas bag, <br/>\nkids activities, free parking, etc etc!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just thrilled that you guys did all the work to get HENA going <br/>\n& to have the conference in the first place! Since I unschool, I <br/>\nwas happy to have all the unschooling speakers available - Sandra <br/>\n& Pam. Everyone at the registration table was very friendly & helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcoming of kids and even a chance to put them on the college campus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the classes and the vendor fair.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter liked that there were lots of kids! She really enjoyed <br/>\nsewing with Kt. I liked the unschooling panel and presentations. <br/>\nI also really liked seeing the kids and teens. It assured me that <br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling turns out some wonderful people.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling speakers<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd. She should have been keynote. The keynote speaker <br/>\nshould set the key note. The lawyer was great and I&#39;m glad she <br/>\ncame and spoke, but I enjoyed Sandra a lot, or would have liked <br/>\nPam S. to be keynote.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought the conference was very well organized and that is so important.<br/>\n<br/>\nActivities for kids/husbands to attend while I could go around to <br/>\nmeetings/vendors. Loved the talent shows and panels with older kids <br/>\nso that we could see the end result.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing with like minded people. The unschooling session with Pam and Roya.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery doable in one weekend. Smaller conference than we have been <br/>\nto in the past, not so daunting. Loved the idea of kid&#39;s activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the location (ASU) which was close to restaurants etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe amount of kids activities available, in the main hallway where <br/>\nwe could generally keep an eye on them. That was nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nJessica Murphy –ASL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe organization class, and the Unit Studies class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a really nice assortment of speakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeakers<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting new people (homeschoolers) & learning about vendors<br/>\n<br/>\nWe loved the ASU music student demonstration and how great they <br/>\nwere with the kids. There was always someone available to ask if <br/>\nyou had a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalent Show!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so wonderful talking to unschoolers of older kids and know <br/>\nthat what I&#39;m doing is not only working for us but actually does <br/>\nwork! I feel much more positive about what I&#39;m doing (and not doing) <br/>\nwith my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeeting homeschooled kids and family groups- We were intrigued by <br/>\nunschooling before we went-really enjoyed meeting unschooled students.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile nothing was really &#39;new&#39; or innovative, I came away very <br/>\ninvigorated. Overall, the speakers re-affirmed many ideas that I&#39;ve <br/>\nlatched onto.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there were panels that we could ask advice/hear responses, <br/>\nI learned more from the wee bits of testimony given by attendees <br/>\nabout what worked in their home. ~Honestly here, I am already <br/>\nreally looking forward to the conference next year! From the <br/>\nattendee point of view - it was GREAT!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe activities for kids were wonderful. My kids had the BEST time. <br/>\nIt was so nice to be able to take the kids and have them be a part <br/>\nof things.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning about how to keep records for graduation and college. <br/>\nWhat universities expect from HS kids. Also, the organization was <br/>\ngreat help. I think more about that would be great. Also, my <br/>\ndaughter loved the drama class and the out of africa exhibit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will you enjoy? <br/>\nHENA 2008 Conference – Infinite Possibilities<br/>\nHome Education Network of Arizona | www.HENA.us<br/>\n2340 East Glade Avenue, Mesa, AZ 85204<br/>\n602-692-8923 – <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:conference@...\">conference@...</a> <br/>\nIf you have any other suggestions or questions, please do pass <br/>\nthem on to <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:conference@...\">conference@...</a> at any time and this will go to all <br/>\nthe conference coordinators on the conference committee!
