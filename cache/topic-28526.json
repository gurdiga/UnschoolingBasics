I&#39;ve been around for years actually but am trying to distance myself<br/>\nonline from my/my kids identities just out of not worrying about linking to<br/>\nmy professional life or my kids&#39; future embarrassment.<br/>\nI am a waffler.  I have always had a relatively unschoolish approach to my<br/>\nparenting.  Whether the kids were in school or homeschooling (this is our<br/>\n3rd year) they haven&#39;t had set bedtimes, restrictions on tv or video games,<br/>\netc.  We are a close, tightly knit family.  The kids are 17 (in school<br/>\npurely by choice), 12 and 8.  We school at home, although flexibly.  I go<br/>\nthrough phases of thinking unschooling is a perfect idea (when I run across<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s writings, when I check in to the old email lists, etc.)<br/>\n During those phases I am more tuned in to my kids, more peaceful in<br/>\ngeneral.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my problems.  The kids are very &quot;school smart&quot; and they know it.<br/>\n I&#39;m afraid they put a lot of value in that part of them (definitely my<br/>\nfault as that&#39;s where I found my value, and my parents before them; also I<br/>\nam naturally very proud of them and genuinely praise their abilities, in all<br/>\nareas not just academic!).  I think they would feel very badly about<br/>\nthemselves if they did &#39;fall behind&#39; where they thought they should be<br/>\n(which is &#39;ahead&#39;).  On the other hand, neither of them has lost their love<br/>\nof learning whatsoever despite being in school and school-at-home their<br/>\nwhole lives.  They read voraciously, online and off; they love reading<br/>\nhistory and learning about science.  They know a ton, most of which they<br/>\nhaven&#39;t learned in school.  They both research whatever they don&#39;t know.  My<br/>\n12 y.o. practically lives in wikipedia sometimes.  So I know they would be<br/>\nlearning, and they would know it.  I guess my only concern is math (I know<br/>\nhow typical).  They are both advanced in math, very good at it, and<br/>\nbeginning to hate it.  I don&#39;t want them to hate it, but I don&#39;t want them<br/>\nto feel stupid or even just not-smart either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI work full time from home, and I love my career.  It is very rewarding and<br/>\nit pays well.  I have always felt that I would never be able to put in the<br/>\ntime and effort necessary to unschool properly.  I recently changed<br/>\npositions and companies and feel much more available (not in terms of time,<br/>\nbut energy and effort; I&#39;m in a creativity-inducing job instead of<br/>\ncreativity-sucking).  They are on an extended Christmas vacation at the<br/>\nmoment, which began on Monday when my 12 y.o. started crying about doing his<br/>\nalgebra.  He was obviously just burnt out.  So we quit.  I talked with him<br/>\nabout what parts of his school work he enjoys, and would he like to change<br/>\nthe setup he is in and just do his own thing.  He said no, but he did ask to<br/>\nhave Christmas vacation start early.  So we did.  I&#39;m considering what to do<br/>\ncome January.  I *do* know that learning occurs when it is desired by the<br/>\nlearner.  I know also that certain processes only come easily from practice;<br/>\nand will come from practice whether it&#39;s desired or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I both work in education.  We both have graduate degrees, and<br/>\nthe kids have seen our progress through college (especially the older 2, but<br/>\neven the youngest remembers some of it).  I wonder if it is even possible<br/>\nfor us to move toward unschooling when schooling has been such an emphasis<br/>\nin our lives!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28524,"nextTopicId":28529}}
