Though I will admit  that I may be a little <br/>\ndefensive. :~}&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be defensive!!:) I  think you&#39;re an incredibly aware parent, <br/>\nfinding such a creative solution  for allowing your child to stay out <br/>\nof school.<br/>\nNot everyone has a  full-time partner in this adventure. I&#39;m always <br/>\nencouraging single parents  to look at other options if their <br/>\nchildren don&#39;t want to be in school! I  think you&#39;ve found a really <br/>\ngreat one.<br/>\nI was fortunate enough to have  plenty of support for my 6 month <br/>\nstint as a single parent. I know that  even if something happened to <br/>\nmy dh or I, my children could continue their  unschooling adventures.<br/>\nIt&#39;s great to read about single parents making  things work.<br/>\n<br/>\nA close friend here in Pensacola is trying to come up with  solutions <br/>\nfor keeping her dd out of school....she&#39;s asking other  homeschooling <br/>\nparents to babysit. Right now she&#39;s in a very small daycare  <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\nNot all parents with children in school or daycare are part  of <br/>\nmainstream practices.<br/>\nSome of my good friends are huge supporters of  unschooling but their <br/>\nchildren have chosen school for right now. Their  children don&#39;t have <br/>\nall the baggage that most school kids do, because  their parents <br/>\ncounter all that crap. It&#39;s working for them. The children  know they <br/>\ncan come home any time, that grades don&#39;t matter, and that the  <br/>\nparents will support their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool and daycare don&#39;t have  to be horrible for children, it  <br/>\ndepends.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************<br/>\nBefore Julian was born (he&#39;s now 15), his dad, my partner, and I all worked  <br/>\nin daycare.  At about 6 months Julian started going a couple  of mornings a <br/>\nweek to a family that were good friends, and had a child in  the center where <br/>\nJ&#39;s dad worked. <br/>\n <br/>\nThen before he was 3, he went with his dad to the day care center. By the  <br/>\ntime he was 4, none of us worked in day care anymore, and he was with me until  <br/>\nhe started Kindergarten. We pulled him out after 3rd grade.<br/>\n <br/>\nInterestingly, many of the families I worked with in that day care center  <br/>\nhomeschooled after the experience with the center. It was a funky day care  <br/>\ncenter started by a bunch of cool hippy-types 15 years before we made a  <br/>\nconnection there. It was very child-centered and sweet, not stressing academics.  When <br/>\na bunch of the kids reached Kindergarten age, their parent pleaded with us  to <br/>\nstart a Kindergarten program for them, and we did.  They weren&#39;t ready  to <br/>\nsend their kids to &quot;regular&quot; school, and we were happy to keep them.<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter that year, most of those kids either stayed, went to alternative  <br/>\nprograms, or started homeschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\nBeing home full-time is not an option, or desireable, for everybody. The  <br/>\ntrick is finding wonderful places for our kids to be when we can&#39;t be with  them.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4977,"nextTopicId":4928}}
