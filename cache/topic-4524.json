Alternative Education Institute charges something like <br/>\n$15 per year and only requires the registration form <br/>\nand &quot;attendance&quot; (which can simply be an email).<br/>\n<br/>\nFlorida is an easy state, but you need to understand the laws here <br/>\nand just what your choices are.
