She decided to register for the local public school s charter program (project based learning) so we re busy making her experiences","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1972108891\">That&#39;s my daughter (14).   She decided to register for the local public<br/>\nschool&#39;s charter program (project based learning) so we&#39;re busy making<br/>\nher experiences fit a transcript and catching her up academically. <br/>\nShe&#39;s quite excited about this and I don&#39;t blame her.  It sounds<br/>\nterribly fun.  However, the realist in me recognizes that it&#39;s not going<br/>\nto be all fun, but lots of hard work,  and even though it&#39;s project<br/>\nbased there will be academic requirements that are likely to challenge<br/>\nher (and not in a good way).  She expects it to be hard, but at age 14,<br/>\nI think she can&#39;t really visualize it like I can.  Maybe I&#39;m just<br/>\npessimistic,  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ll do everything I can to help her<br/>\nsucceed, but I&#39;ve come to realize (finally) why this is so appealing to<br/>\nher - she&#39;s lonely, bored and restless.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our town, most homsechooled teens are absorbed into the public school<br/>\nenvironment and those of us who are not, are left to hear the crickets<br/>\nchirp.  The next town over has a sizable unschooling group with park<br/>\ndays every week but my kids are no long willing to go.  They feel like<br/>\noutsiders, and that makes them feel uncomfortable.   I&#39;m not sure what<br/>\nmakes them feel like outsiders, but in any case, they won&#39;t go.  They<br/>\ntell me I can go myself.  ;)  She&#39;s not interested in taking local<br/>\nclasses like photography or cake decorating or things that would<br/>\ngenerally appeal to her and I think it&#39;s because she wants to be with<br/>\nother teens.  I can&#39;t blame her and I can&#39;t figure out how to provide<br/>\nthat for her.  At the very least, I want her to enjoy this summer before<br/>\nschool starts but in the back of my head I&#39;m also thinking if she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to continue with this school, I don&#39;t want her to dread<br/>\ncoming home.   She has enough learning challenges that I suspect she&#39;s<br/>\nnot going to enjoy the school experience very long, so I&#39;m trying to<br/>\nfigure out how to meet her social need, but I&#39;m stuck.<br/>\nHelp?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48410,"nextTopicId":48480}}
