As far as leaving the house goes, I<br/>\nknow it isn&#39;t necessarily fair that we ask her to come with us, but<br/>\nhonestly, we are accustomed to doing things as a family. We have always gone<br/>\nand did things, all four of us. Even running errands, grocery shopping, the<br/>\nwhole nine yards. She says going to the store is boring now (so we don&#39;t<br/>\ntypically take her anymore). Sometimes though, the errands have to include<br/>\nboth Roger and I. What do we do then?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  =&#92;&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My ds gets like that too. Friday I wanted to go take them to play at out club ( awesome kids area) and his friends where going to be there. He did not want to. I stayed home. No big deal. DH went grocery shopping even thou I wanted to go to and got what we needed.<br/>\n  My ds also have a Nintendo DS that makes going out easier for him when he is in a video game mode.<br/>\n  Sometimes he will take his ds and play it only in the car. But I think because I have listened to him and d&#92;stayed home many times when he asked he is more willing to come when we need to.<br/>\n  Because your dd had video games limited in her life ( my ds never had anything limited) it is probably harder for her to let go. Little by little she will begin to trust that you will not limit her again and she will be able to let go when you need. But there will be times when won&#39;t.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  =-=-=--=-=-=-=-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, she hits yelling and near melt down mode if we ask to use<br/>\nthe computer for a minute while she is on. Generally, she has full rein of<br/>\nthe computer from the time she gets up, until she goes to bed at night, BUT<br/>\nheaven forbid if we need to use the computer for anything. For example, I<br/>\ndid my SIL&#39;s taxes last year and she called me asking me to send them to her<br/>\nby email. I told Marti that I needed to use the computer for a second and<br/>\ngot hostility in response. I don&#39;t know how to handle this hostility because<br/>\nit just makes me want to revert back to my old parenting ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe even have two computers and her favorite games (mainly Furcadia) is<br/>\ninstalled on both computers, but the files on the &quot;good&quot; (ie faster, so it<br/>\ngets used the most) computer are not accessible from the Compaq (the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\ncomputer) because the network is not working properly even though we have<br/>\ntried many times to fix that. So, theoretically she could go to the Compaq,<br/>\nalthough I do know that is a lot to ask so I try not to.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>\n  Can YOU use the &quot;bad&quot; computer??? Can you get her another computer?<br/>\n  Also if she is concentrated in her game and you want her to stop so you can used it that can be frustrating to a young child. My ds just gave me a couple of minutes to write this e-mail. He has been very generous today but I know that if he was really into a new thing it would not have gone so smooth. <br/>\n<br/>\n  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is it for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic. My youngest has<br/>\nthis imaginary &quot;friend&quot; named Grandma-Aunt Shell (not sure whether this is a<br/>\ngrandma or an aunt, it changes from moment to moment, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>\nissue). Now the past three days in a row she has told me that she wants me<br/>\nto take her to this person&#39;s house. I don&#39;t really know what to say, so I<br/>\nsay &quot;I don&#39;t know where she lives&quot; and she tells me that she will show me<br/>\nhow to get there. Do I take her out and really try to let her show me where<br/>\nthis person lives or do you think... I don&#39;t know. What would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  =-=-=-=-----=-=-=-<br/>\n  Like someone said. Go drive to the friends house and see where it leads you. It may be a fun adventure. <br/>\n  My ds had two imaginary friends a long time ago. Jack and Sweeper. I treated them like his real friends. I actually miss them now that they are gone. &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] DD/video games & Imaginary friends","postDate":"1202056559","msgId":29322,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyMzUyMi4zNzQ2Ni5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDgwMjAyMTY0NHZhNGVlNWQ5eWExNzBkYzc2MjgxYzU3ZjJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29316,"nextInTopic":29323,"prevInTime":29321,"nextInTime":29323,"topicId":29310,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My oldest daughter is 7 1/2 and LOVES video games.

As far as leaving the house goes, I<br/>\nknow it isn&#39;t necessarily fair that we ask her to come with us, but<br/>\nhonestly, we are accustomed to doing things as a family. We have always gone<br/>\nand did things, all four of us. Even running errands, grocery shopping, the<br/>\nwhole nine yards. She says going to the store is boring now (so we don&#39;t<br/>\ntypically take her anymore). Sometimes though, the errands have to include<br/>\nboth Roger and I. What do we do then?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  =&#92;&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;=&#92;<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My ds gets like that too. Friday I wanted to go take them to play at out club ( awesome kids area) and his friends where going to be there. He did not want to. I stayed home. No big deal. DH went grocery shopping even thou I wanted to go to and got what we needed.<br/>\n  My ds also have a Nintendo DS that makes going out easier for him when he is in a video game mode.<br/>\n  Sometimes he will take his ds and play it only in the car. But I think because I have listened to him and d&#92;stayed home many times when he asked he is more willing to come when we need to.<br/>\n  Because your dd had video games limited in her life ( my ds never had anything limited) it is probably harder for her to let go. Little by little she will begin to trust that you will not limit her again and she will be able to let go when you need. But there will be times when won&#39;t.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  =-=-=--=-=-=-=-=--=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a related note, she hits yelling and near melt down mode if we ask to use<br/>\nthe computer for a minute while she is on. Generally, she has full rein of<br/>\nthe computer from the time she gets up, until she goes to bed at night, BUT<br/>\nheaven forbid if we need to use the computer for anything. For example, I<br/>\ndid my SIL&#39;s taxes last year and she called me asking me to send them to her<br/>\nby email. I told Marti that I needed to use the computer for a second and<br/>\ngot hostility in response. I don&#39;t know how to handle this hostility because<br/>\nit just makes me want to revert back to my old parenting ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe even have two computers and her favorite games (mainly Furcadia) is<br/>\ninstalled on both computers, but the files on the &quot;good&quot; (ie faster, so it<br/>\ngets used the most) computer are not accessible from the Compaq (the &quot;bad&quot;<br/>\ncomputer) because the network is not working properly even though we have<br/>\ntried many times to fix that. So, theoretically she could go to the Compaq,<br/>\nalthough I do know that is a lot to ask so I try not to.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-<br/>\n  Can YOU use the &quot;bad&quot; computer??? Can you get her another computer?<br/>\n  Also if she is concentrated in her game and you want her to stop so you can used it that can be frustrating to a young child. My ds just gave me a couple of minutes to write this e-mail. He has been very generous today but I know that if he was really into a new thing it would not have gone so smooth. <br/>\n<br/>\n  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is it for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic. My youngest has<br/>\nthis imaginary &quot;friend&quot; named Grandma-Aunt Shell (not sure whether this is a<br/>\ngrandma or an aunt, it changes from moment to moment, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>\nissue). Now the past three days in a row she has told me that she wants me<br/>\nto take her to this person&#39;s house. I don&#39;t really know what to say, so I<br/>\nsay &quot;I don&#39;t know where she lives&quot; and she tells me that she will show me<br/>\nhow to get there. Do I take her out and really try to let her show me where<br/>\nthis person lives or do you think... I don&#39;t know. What would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  =-=-=-=-----=-=-=-<br/>\n  Like someone said. Go drive to the friends house and see where it leads you. It may be a fun adventure. <br/>\n  My ds had two imaginary friends a long time ago. Jack and Sweeper. I treated them like his real friends. I actually miss them now that they are gone. &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alex<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"Alysia","from":"Alysia &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:Imaginary friends","postDate":"1202052498","msgId":29325,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk2MzM5MS42MzI3NS5xbUB3ZWI0NTkxMC5tYWlsLnNwMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":29323,"nextInTopic":29336,"prevInTime":29324,"nextInTime":29326,"topicId":29310,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Now, just a quick question on the imaginary friends topic.

He spent 6 months straight just watching tv, with them trusting him and sometimes wondering if that&#39;s all he would ever choose to do again, then one day just didn&#39;t turn the tv on, and his tv watching has been off and on ever since.

What would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a bunch everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nWife to Roger (together 10 years)<br/>\nMum to Marti (7.5) and Lilly (4)<br/>\nBabysitter to Stella (3.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy love to Uncle Jesse&#39;s family.
