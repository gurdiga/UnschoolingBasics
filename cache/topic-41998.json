How much reading is actually necessary and how much can kids figure out on their own? It would also depend on the age of the kid and how confident the child is in general. Some kids have the innate skills to &quot;work&quot; a group scene and get by without reading, while others will freeze up without help. So its important to know your child (and have your child&#39;s permission!) before talking to someone. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231930081,"authorName":"DJ250","from":"&quot;DJ250&quot; &lt;dj250@...&gt;","profile":"wibberbie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Limited reading and activities","postDate":"1257171895","msgId":41999,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGQTdBRUZEQUI4QTQxQTg5REU3NDM0OTdEMjQ4NDc0QHJvY2tldHNhdWNlPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhjbXBvcytvY3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41998,"nextInTopic":42010,"prevInTime":41998,"nextInTime":42000,"topicId":41998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes, I have done that with my 10 y.o..
