Or is someone making you?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Seriously, choosing to see the things we do as choices is powerful! It <br/>\n*will* change your life and the lives of those around you. I choose to <br/>\ndo all sorts of weird and difficult things because it makes me feel <br/>\ngood afterwards or I get some kind of sick thrill out of seeing the <br/>\npoop scooped or the lawn mowed or the happy faces of conference <br/>\nattendees! &lt;bwg&gt; I don&#39;t do them because I *have* to, but because I <br/>\n*choose* to.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I could get a maid to come in weekly. I could eat of paper plates and <br/>\nnapkins. I *choose* to clean my house because then I know where things <br/>\nare. I choose to wash dishes because I don&#39;t like throwing a bunch of <br/>\nplastic in the landfills. I choose to wash cotton napkins rather than <br/>\ncondemn a tree. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Changing the way I looked at these things was easier than I thought it <br/>\nwould be. Rather than huffing about having to fold laundry---aGAIN---I <br/>\ntook a deep breath and noticed how big the boys have grown. I grew <br/>\nwistful thinking about the tiny little t-shirts they used to wear. <br/>\nRather than moan---aGAIN---about washing dishes when the dishwasher was <br/>\nbroken, I started thinking about my favorite dishes or what all we had <br/>\nfor supper. Rather than bitch--aGAIN---about cleaning the boys&#39; rooms, <br/>\nI think about Lisa Strebler, Joanna Wlikinson, and Diana Jenner, who <br/>\neach lost a child. That really puts everything into perspective. <br/>\nQuickly!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I quite frequently clean it for them. Sometimes what we do is trade. I<br/>\n do their room (because they like that the least) and they clean<br/>\n something else in the house (like the kitchen or bathroom).<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  I can do laundry to the last bit. I hate to put it away. I can do the <br/>\ndishes to the last bit. I hate to put them away. Cameron likes to put <br/>\nboth away. Lucky me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of the side benefits of seeing what we do as choices and not <br/>\nchores is that our children do too. If we approach dirty or difficult <br/>\nthings in our lives as things we CHOOSE to do---JOYFULLY, rather than <br/>\nwith anger or bitterness---so will our children!<br/>\n<br/>\n HUGE side benefit! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want.

You could choose to <br/>\npay someone to come in and clean. You could choose not to buy bananas. <br/>\nYou could choose to not have beds with an &quot;under&quot; for things to get to <br/>\n(DS&#39; has a &quot;mate&#39;s bed&quot; which has drawers underneath so there&#39;s no way <br/>\nfor stuff to get &quot;under&quot; the bed - it&#39;s a big box with a mattress on <br/>\ntop). You could choose a lot of things besides cleaning under the <br/>\nbeds. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when you say &quot;Yes I do things I don&#39;t choose to do&quot; that&#39;s not <br/>\nquite accurate - you CHOOSE to do things that might not be your <br/>\nfavorite things to do because you dislike the consequences more than <br/>\nyou dislike the activity involved. You dislike fruit flies more than <br/>\nyou dislike cleaning under the bed - so you choose the cleaning. You <br/>\ncould choose the fruit flies. It&#39;s ALL choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I think that in our culture, having a choice means picking <br/>\nthings we like when really it just means there are two or more options <br/>\nto the situation - and there are very few situations that have no <br/>\noptions (dying is one). Even paying taxes is a choice - you can be <br/>\na &quot;tax resister&quot; and risk going to jail and having property seized. <br/>\nYou can move to someplace that has no income tax. And so on. I&#39;ve even <br/>\nconsidered on occasion moving to NH where there&#39;s no sales tax - but <br/>\n(a) there&#39;s more homeschool regulation than here in CT (b) they have a <br/>\nhefty &#39;entertainment tax&#39; and we really like movies and dining out. <br/>\nSo, we CHOOSE to stay in CT because the lack of state intervention in <br/>\nour unschooling lives really overrides the rest. <br/>\n<br/>\nChoices are everywhere. And, it really changes my whole outlook when I <br/>\nrecognize that. I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do the dishes ... but I like having <br/>\na clean, non-smelly, non-buggy kitchen and making it an active choice <br/>\nempowers me rather than giving the dishes the power to change my <br/>\noutlook. So, I choose to do the dishes, I select a dish liquid that I <br/>\nlike (the orange cleaners are nice - clean well and smell great). I <br/>\nsometimes put on some music. More often I use it as quiet thinking <br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Okay...questions","postDate":"1153321609","msgId":15862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5bGhxOSt1amljQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA3MTgxMzMzdDJkMGI3YTZ4MTNkN2Y4OTM2NjYyY2QzMkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":15857,"nextInTopic":15868,"prevInTime":15861,"nextInTime":15863,"topicId":15821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

DS got one <br/>\nof those cheap plastic bristle dart games somewhere (forget why or <br/>\nwhere). He fell in love with it. However, the bristle started <br/>\nbreaking making it even harder to get the silly darts to stick. Last <br/>\nnight, while Ds was at MIL&#39;s as usual, DH and I stopped in to a <br/>\nsporting goods place to browse the kayaks (we&#39;re considering getting <br/>\na couple - they&#39;re way easier to manage/transport than our current <br/>\nlarge canoe). While we were there, we passed the regular dartboards <br/>\nand DH mentioned how much DS liked the little dartboard but how hard <br/>\nit was getting with the broken bits. We looked at the selection and <br/>\npicked an inexpensive, electronic, soft tip set (weighted like <br/>\nregular darts but with plastic tips - can&#39;t pierce skin but would <br/>\nhurt if hit hard with one). We set it in the back seat of the car <br/>\nand headed to pick DS up. We hung around and chatted a bit as usual <br/>\nthen told DS there was a surprise in the car for him. He said his <br/>\ngoodbyes and headed to the car. When he saw what it was he gasped in <br/>\nglee, jumped back out of the car and wrapped a big hug around me. <br/>\nThen I said &quot;Daddy told me how much you liked the dart game and how <br/>\nit was getting broken&quot; so he ran over to DH (who was still on the <br/>\nsidewalk near the house, I was right at the car already) and gave <br/>\nhim a massive hug and thank you (which DH loved - I could see *him* <br/>\nlight up as well as DS&#39; major glow of glee - being able to do stuff <br/>\nlike this for DS, getting things he would enjoy &quot;just because&quot; not <br/>\nfor any &quot;reason&quot; or anything he earned, is really healing for DH). <br/>\nAnyhow, long story longer, by the time we got home, we set about <br/>\ngetting the batteries in and reading a bit of how to operate the <br/>\nelectronic settings. Then it was getting late (I need to get to be <br/>\nso I can be up for work in the a.m) and DH wanted to be able to <br/>\nclean and rearrange the basement &#39;rec room&#39; area in order to make a <br/>\nproper space to hang the dartboard. So, he told DS that he would be <br/>\ncleaning and organizing the area in order to hang the board in the <br/>\nmorning. If he wanted to, DS could help with it which would help <br/>\nthings get done faster so they could play sooner. I&#39;m guessing <br/>\nthey&#39;re already done and playing as I type.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne recent humorous bit is that DS has taken a liking to the weed <br/>\nwhacker for some reason. About two weeks ago, DH asked if DS would <br/>\nlike to weed whack while he (DH) was cutting some branches and doing <br/>\nother yard work. DS said Sure! and got dressed, got his sunglasses <br/>\nas eye protection and DH showed him how to safely use the thing. He <br/>\ndid about an hour that day and has done about an hour or so in <br/>\nsmaller bits since then without us mentioning a word. Last Saturday, <br/>\nafter he finished breakfast he said &quot;I want to do some weed whacking <br/>\nso I&#39;m going to go get dressed&quot; and off he went...

So, sending a child to their <br/>\nroom (or time out or whatever) does nothing to address the cause, <br/>\njust the symptom. It&#39;s like sucking a Ricola cough drop for a <br/>\nserious throat infection - it might calm the symptoms temporarily, <br/>\nbut the underlying issue is still there and will come back and more. <br/>\nYou may even do it enough that the child no longer screams at you - <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean the underlying issue is gone, just that they&#39;ve gotten <br/>\nbetter at hiding or ignoring it. Sometimes it may look like the <br/>\nscreaming is not being addressed (because there&#39;s no one <br/>\nsaying &quot;Don&#39;t yell; go to your room&quot; etc). There have been times in <br/>\nthe past when my son hit me and I just hugged him and gave him a <br/>\nkiss (I&#39;m sure there were people going &quot;what is she, nuts?&quot;). He <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need me to jump on him for hitting - he already felt bad.

I am his <br/>\npartner in learning to deal with the world, not his adversary. Kids <br/>\ncome into the world fully equipped with a set of emotions. What they <br/>\ndon&#39;t have at that point are the skills to deal with expressing <br/>\nthose emotions in a manner that is safe for themselves and those <br/>\naround them. That&#39;s where we come in. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother part of the situation is learning our kids. Knowing when a <br/>\nsituation is getting too overwhelming and they need help. Knowing <br/>\nwhen something just is not a good idea and skipping it. Knowing that <br/>\nhe needs to eat every 3 hours even though he&#39;s now 8, not a <br/>\nnursling. And so on.

You can put a child to bed at 9:00 but<br/>\nthat doesn&#39;t mean that they are going to fall asleep at 9:00.  My<br/>\ndaughter Emily is the perfect example of that.  She is a night owl.<br/>\nWas born a night owl.  Has always been a night owl.  Her energy rarely<br/>\ngets running until mid afternoon and she is at her peak creativity<br/>\nafter 11pm.  For years we tried getting her to go to bed at a bedtime<br/>\nbecause she needed to live in &quot;the real world.&quot;  (rolling eyes).  At<br/>\n9:00 (or whatever her bedtime was) we would send her to bed.  She<br/>\nwould almost always still be awake at 11:00 when I would check on her<br/>\nbefore going to sleep.  Then I would be dragging her out of bed at<br/>\n6:00 am for school or when we stopped going to school around 8:00 so<br/>\nshe could have the whole day to do things.  Somehow I thought that if<br/>\nI could get her in a habit of getting up earlier then she would have a<br/>\nmore &quot;normal&quot; schedule.  Now I know that what is &quot;normal&quot; for her is<br/>\nthis really weird (to me a morning person) schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about insisting on respect from children (express yourself but<br/>\n&gt; watch your tone kind of thing)? Is this also taboo?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wanting to be respected is not taboo.  *Expecting* someone, *anyone,*<br/>\nis.  I want to be respected, but my children are not going to learn to<br/>\nbe respectful unless they are treated with respect first.  I was<br/>\nchannel flipping last night and came across an episode of The Nanny<br/>\n(someone whose parenting philosophies I disagree with about 98% of the<br/>\ntime).  Anyway the family that she was working with showed a mom who<br/>\nbasically ignored her two children.  They sat in front of the tv all<br/>\nday or played video games.  This would be fine in an unschooling<br/>\nfamily with a mindful parent.  Then she decides that they need to do<br/>\nsomething for her. I don&#39;t remember what, but the children are sitting<br/>\nthere watching tv and in the middle of the program the formerly<br/>\nuninvolved parent turns off the tv and states that it is &quot;her way or<br/>\nno way. Sorry tv is off, get over it.&quot; After this there comes a huge<br/>\nfight where the son actually gets physical with the mom hitting her<br/>\nand she leaves him in his room.  I think that I would be pretty ticked<br/>\ntoo if someone had ignored me all day and then suddenly decided that<br/>\nthey were going to control my life, turning off something I was<br/>\nengaged in and bullying me around being &quot;boss.&quot;  The mother showed NO<br/>\nrespect to these children and then got upset when her son showed her<br/>\nno respect in return.  He didn&#39;t comply.  Children will not learn<br/>\nrespect if they, themselves, are not treated with respect.  Do you<br/>\nwant to be respectful to people who treat you poorly?<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that my children have come to treat me with respect and<br/>\ndignity because I have respected them, their needs and treated them as<br/>\nloving whole people who have dreams, hopes and desires and helped them<br/>\nin a achieving those things not because I gave them a list of rules to<br/>\nteach them to &quot;respect their elders.&quot;  I also think that they are<br/>\nrespectful to most other people that they encounter.  I have seen my<br/>\nchildren, on occasion, be disrespectful towards someone, but it would<br/>\nbe a case where I would probably end up being disrespectful as well  -<br/>\nbecause they were not themselves being treated with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Okay...questions","postDate":"1153195691","msgId":15823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5aG1yYisxczhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15821,"nextInTopic":15827,"prevInTime":15822,"nextInTime":15824,"topicId":15821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Am I right or are approximate bed times taboo in unschooling circles?

Is this also taboo?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no &quot;taboo&#39;s&quot;, but you might get questioned or given options<br/>\non this list that are different. That&#39;s all.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent says &quot;I trust you to learn what you want when you want&quot;<br/>\nbut then insists on lights out at 9pm every night, that isn&#39;t trusting<br/>\nthe child to learn about their body&#39;s need for sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t paying attention to their body signs of<br/>\ntiredness, or helping them transition to sleep. It means a time is<br/>\nless important than helping them to sleep when they&#39;re actually tired.<br/>\nThat&#39;s all. For some kids it will happen at roughly the same time<br/>\nevery night (unless they go through a growth spurt or other change)<br/>\nfor others it varies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how anyone can &quot;insist on respect&quot; since respect would be<br/>\nsomething another person feels. We can&#39;t control how another person<br/>\nfeels, but we CAN manipulate them enough to get fake respect.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s better to act in a way that earns respect. If we treat<br/>\nour children respectfully, they&#39;ll be more likely to give respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost children are treated so disrespectfully, and then the parents<br/>\ndemand this &quot;respect&quot; they haven&#39;t earned. It&#39;s sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, do I ask my child to treat me kindly? Sure.<br/>\nJalen (5) is a very intense child to say the least. He tends to act<br/>\nout his emotions without pause...which leads to screaming or angry<br/>\nwords. When we have a moment to pause and talk, he really doesn&#39;t WANT<br/>\nto be that way. In fact, after a particularly rough day today, he said<br/>\n&quot;I wish I didn&#39;t feel crazy inside&quot;.<br/>\nHe FEELS that out-of-control feeling and doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing I can do for him, is to gently (which I sometimes fail<br/>\nmiserably at) remind him that I don&#39;t like being screamed at. When he<br/>\nyells &quot;get me my goggles&quot;, I DO say something along the lines of &quot;I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like being screamed at, all you have to do is talk to me!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remind him daily that talking is a great way to get help. Slowly, he<br/>\nis becoming more capable of calmiing himself faster. I have no control<br/>\nover how he feels, but I can act in a respectful manner myself, and<br/>\nthat makes it likely he will  learn those skills in his own time and<br/>\nway. The rest of my children are very kind and sweet and yes,<br/>\nrespectful. It&#39;s all part of their learning...just like everything<br/>\nelse in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265650445,"authorName":"agasma7","from":"&quot;agasma7&quot; &lt;facingeast@...&gt;","profile":"agasma7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Okay...questions","postDate":"1153181642","msgId":15821,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU5aDk0YSs4dGphQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15823,"prevInTime":15820,"nextInTime":15822,"topicId":15821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Apparently, I am missing something. so I am going to ask very basic honest questions about unschooling in hopes that I can at least get clarity.
