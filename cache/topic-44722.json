That&#39;s not necessarily reassuring, because &quot;schooled&quot; or not, the constant learning every day in every way, is learning is about who they are, how to live, what family means, and so forth. There&#39;s no standard curriculum imaginable for the really important lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeredith mentioned adults with self-esteem issues, for example. That&#39;s part of learning who we are and how to live in childhood. Another example: everybody&#39;s kids are learning at this moment, what kind of parents to be to our grandchildren. And what kind of citizens to be, etc. Sometimes I wonder if all our collective and individual concern about teaching discrete measurable school skills and subjects is a way of pushing down our fears and ignorance about these much more important kinds of learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was schooled myself and had a school career, like John Holt.  So I&#39;m not the best teacher for such learning, at least not anymore. Meredith is right that increasingly, you can learn more from the unschooled kids themselves. Just look at what they&#39;ve learned, about all the important stuff School can&#39;t control! <br/>\n<br/>\nA few of the teen stories Meredith linked are from me and our always-unschooled daughter as a young teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen at age 16, she started her own blog, writing about her first independent experiences with everything from college classes, jobs, driving, voting, religion and sex, to family, food, travel, cultural role models and social commentary (movies and tv, Barbie dolls and purity balls, spanking.) <br/>\n<br/>\nShe pretty much said it all in the next three years, before turning 20. Many of her teen essays reflect &quot;how&quot; she learned or didn&#39;t learn something. You can also see her learning and development as it happens from age 16 to 19, by reading chronologically from October 2006 forward. I never got around to adding her unschooler&#39;s blog at Sandra&#39;s:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://misedjj.wordpress.com/\">http://misedjj.wordpress.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOr jump around any way you like, by typing &quot;math&quot; for example -- a traumatic subject for both of us! -- in her blog&#39;s search box, and then reading all those posts that come up, again starting from the earliest date.<br/>\n<br/>\nJJ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt; I still catch myself, when they are playing pretend or running in the woods, thinking that they aren&#39;t learning anything.<br/>\n&gt; *****************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; catching yourself and saying &quot;woops, of course they&#39;re learning, la la la I can&#39;t hear you, bad old tapes!&quot; is often part of the process. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>. . .

After I quit teaching to unschool with my kids, I continued tutoring school kids to make a bit of money.  My time would&#39;ve been better spent just talking with the parents about honoring their children, being on their side, seeing the positives and strengths and unique intricacies of their child rather than focusing on what needs &quot;fixing.&quot;  The parents, without realizing it, were more concerned with what the teacher thought (& what grades their kids got, & whether or not they were &quot;keeping up&quot; with the other kids, etc) than how their child was feeling....  Their child who came to me with slumped shoulders and timid; or with head thrown back in defiance; or any other manifestation of not being honored.  I talked a lot with the kids about how we each have things that come easily to us, and we each usually have things that don&#39;t - and that school doesn&#39;t usually honor that.  I like to think that at least for that one hour we spent together, I wasn&#39;t a person trying to fix them, but helping them feel ok regardless of what others were saying and doing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also hear a lot of adults saying how they struggle with math (the biggest one) so they don&#39;t want their child to do the same.

Just when I think I&#39;m moving in the right direction, I get sideswiped and thrown back. I should mention now that the workbook issue hasn&#39;t been an issue this week, not because I tried to keep them away from them, but just because they&#39;ve not brought it up. I&#39;ve asked a few times if they wanted to, and each time, they&#39;ve found something else that was more important to them.

I keep telling myself that they will get this. Yet, I wonder if they will. I have my doubts about how they will learn this if it isn&#39;t &quot;taught.&quot; I haven&#39;t meet any unschoolers in person yet, but in reading others accounts, I hear about all the early readers and kids that are doing all kinds of great, creative, fun, exceptional things. These things often seem very educational, and we aren&#39;t there yet. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if I am not cut out for unschooling. I keep trying to bring interesting stuff into our lives, but I often get told they aren&#39;t interested, so I back off. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Having been raised the way you have, do you find you struggle to accept yourself for who you are?

Unschooling is so often a process of personal growth for parents. Having been raised the way you have, do you find you struggle to accept yourself for who you are? Do you find that you struggle to accept your dh for who he is? Those are things to think about. Even if you move away from unschooling, you can still work on... Okay, hang on. I nearly wrote &quot;being more accepting&quot; but that&#39;s not big enough. Step over acceptance to celebration - actively look for what you Do love about your kids, your dh and yourself. Celebrate what&#39;s wonderful about each of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat may seem like its besides the point, that it doesn&#39;t address the problems, but that kind of shift in thinking is at the core of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He constantly tells them what to do and expects so much of them <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>First off, see his love and care as something to celebrate, even though he&#39;s not expressing it very lovingly or kindly. See him loving sooooo much he wants &quot;what is best&quot; for them and is willing to sacrifice his very humanity for their sake. That is, essentially, what parents, especially dads, are adjured to do, and he&#39;s doing it with all his heart. So honor that, rejoice in his willingness to go that far for his kids and then look for ways to offer him his humanity back. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways for him to have warm, comfortable time with the girls. Set them up for some easy-going, gentle things to do together, either one at a time or all together. At the same time, look for ways to be warmer and more giving to him, yourself. Let him feel cared for. Let him feel like you are his safety net, his soft place to fall. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I know that seems besides the point, but that&#39;s a big part of the work of unschooling. Stepping away from textbooks is relatively easy - creating a home where relationships are open and supportive, though, is what allows natural learning to flourish. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: they want to do school??? help","postDate":"1284203380","msgId":44747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2Zm8xaytwN2lsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2ZTJ2YStuMTkyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44746,"nextInTopic":44748,"prevInTime":44746,"nextInTime":44748,"topicId":44722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It sounds like they are getting such mixed messages it may be getting in the way of them learning how to make decisions for themselves and lead anything.

The first summer after starting to deschool often sets kids back to square one in terms of deschooling - ironic, huh? But its amazing how often that happens.

My oldest (who is 13) went to kindergarten but has been happily unschooled ever since. My youngest (10) never attended school at all.  Interestingly it is my youngest who will occasionally ask to &#39;do school.&#39;   Usually this means workbooks. We&#39;ve made trips to Barnes & Noble on whim because my son wants to use them.  I find my youngest tends be more affected/influenced by his traditionally schooled friends, and he worries at times that he is not doing enough &#39;school&#39;   after being around friends who are not unschoolers.  My oldest on the other hand,  is very much an independent thinker and is happy doing his own thing. So, when a request comes in from my youngest(maybe once a year) to &#39;do school&#39; we go to the bookstore and my son chooses a workbook or two (or 7!), and we go home and play with them.  He might do a few pages one day and never go back to them and that satisfies him.  Sometimes I think he just wants to know if he can do school work that would be age appropriate for someone who is actually in school (again, I think being around other children who go to school, or do more traditional school-at-home makes him curious or even a bit anxious about whether he &#39;knows enough&#39;). My youngest undertands unschooling philosophy (from a very young age I would hear him explain to people, without ever being coached by me,  that he &#39;learns by life&#39;).  But yet he does tend  to compare himself with other children  .... so if buying a few workbooks makes him happy and squashes his worries that he doesn&#39;t &#39;know enough&#39;  (believe me, we&#39;ve talked about how much he already knows  even without workbooks) then I am more than happy to provide them. Hope this helps.. I explain all of this as a comparison- my son has never been to school yet still  asks to &#39;to school&#39;.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191799655,"authorName":"flyingtwinsmom","from":"&quot;flyingtwinsmom&quot; &lt;flyingtwinsmom@...&gt;","profile":"flyingtwinsmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: they want to do school??? help","postDate":"1283569182","msgId":44724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk1c2NtdSthMGkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM3OTA4NkVCMDQ0NTRFMzU4QkI4Q0Q4MEZBNkM5ODQwQEx5bGFQQz4="},"prevInTopic":44723,"nextInTopic":44725,"prevInTime":44723,"nextInTime":44725,"topicId":44722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m also trying to find new and interesting things to do and places to go. Please talk me through this.<br/>\nThanks</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44755,"nextTopicId":44757}}
