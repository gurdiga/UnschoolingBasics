I am deschooling myself and <br/>\nmy husband and unschooling my two sons, Nat 11.5 and Joel 3.5.  We <br/>\npulled out of the school system last year and started school at <br/>\nhome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son attended the same elementary school from K through the fifth <br/>\ngrade with only two good years out of six.  I have to say that he had <br/>\nan excellent teacher in the second grade, one of those who manages to <br/>\ninspire a whole classroom full of children with a love of learning.  <br/>\nAnd while I now feel so strongly about unschooling that my youngest <br/>\nwill never set foot in a school, I would like to give credit to that <br/>\nextremely rare creature, the wonderful teacher.  Yes friends, they do <br/>\nexist, however endangered they may be.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was never one of those Mom&#39;s who cheered the first day of <br/>\nschool. And I always resented the homework.  I mean, if I allow the <br/>\nschool to have my precious child for six hours a day, shouldn&#39;t they <br/>\nallow me and my son a few hours together at home in the evening?  And <br/>\nthen there was the FCAT.  The first 3/4 of the schoolyear were spent <br/>\npreparing for it.  They actually got FCAT homework.  I felt that it <br/>\nwas an enormous waste of time and energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the proverbial last straw was the fifth grade teacher.  My son <br/>\nalways hated writing essays and would usually freeze up and write <br/>\nlittle or nothing.  Mrs. C was infuriated by this.  She accused Nat <br/>\nof being lazy and stubborn.  And if he questioned something she said <br/>\nin class she felt threatened by him.  She told me that he needed to <br/>\nbe *knocked down a few pegs* and that he would *have to conform* <br/>\n(while beating her fist on the desk)!  I was so upset that I told her <br/>\nI might just start to homeschool and she responded that maybe I <br/>\nshould.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I did!  And it was the best thing I ever did!  Even school at <br/>\nhome was better than that.  We settled in with a classical ciriculuum <br/>\nthat I designed myself. And slowly dropped what we didn&#39;t like.  In <br/>\nJanuary my husband and I went to a David Albert talk in Orlando.  We <br/>\nhave been deschooling ever since.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad to find this group.  I am on other groups which I read, <br/>\nbut am afraid to post on because they are so large.  I guess I have <br/>\nstage fright.  I am looking forward to the give and take.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace to all and thanks for taking the time to read this.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":459,"nextTopicId":467}}
