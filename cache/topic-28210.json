That is not their job to <br/>\nthink ahead and try to make your life easier.  One suggestion I have <br/>\nmade to my children (i have 4)is that a household of 6 people cannot <br/>\nbe run by any one person.  Everyone needs to pitch in where they can <br/>\nwith what they can and that will free up time for all household <br/>\nmembers.  Then you mom or you dad can join them in a boardgame or <br/>\ncomputer game.  My kids love to play computer games all the time.  <br/>\nThey love it more when I join in and they can teach me the game.  I <br/>\nlearn a lot from my kids as to what they know by letting them teach <br/>\nme.  And boy do they know.  All about the levels and the things they <br/>\nhave to do to get there.

Now, however, we&#39;ve been able to get things working and<br/>\n&gt;   they are LOVING the game (even my 5 year old)!!!

He&#39;s very worried that they<br/>\n&gt;   won&#39;t be prepared for the future, that they won&#39;t be able to &quot;write an<br/>\n&gt;   essay&quot; if they go to college.

I reassured him that I<br/>\n&gt;   finished school, did well, and am HOPELESS at Trivial Pursuit. There<br/>\n&gt;   really are more important things. He knows that, and it&#39;s probably a<br/>\n&gt;   poor example of his concern.
