We are<br/>\ngoing into our 3rd year of unschooling.  We actually started about a year<br/>\nbefore that but were living with parents while relocating and had challenges<br/>\nto say the least.  I have not been without the occasionally worry of are we<br/>\nreally o.k.?  But then I look at all my girls 10 & 13 (about to turn 11 &14<br/>\nin a couple weeks) are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachael (almost 14) is a huge horse person.  She used to show but then<br/>\ndecided she would rather train them and enjoy them instead of the rat race<br/>\nof showing.  Just 5 months ago she purchased a 4yo filly that you could<br/>\nhardly get near to, let alone getting on and riding.  She watched 12+ hours<br/>\nof John Lyons training videos plus she does a ton of internet searching as<br/>\nwell as talking to other professionals.  To make a long story shorter, this<br/>\nhorse turned out to be one of the best riding horses we had!  She paid to<br/>\nput her up for sale on the internet and helped create a flyer for local<br/>\nadvertisement.  This past Monday she sold her for a pretty little profit.<br/>\nShe even did the negotiating with very little help from me.  If that wasn&#39;t<br/>\nenough, in addition to her love for horses she is an incredible artist.<br/>\nLoves to paint horses and landscapes.  She has even taken photos of others<br/>\nhorses and done a painted portrait.  She has been chosen to be included in a<br/>\nlocals art showing at a gallery in our tech college this past Fall.  But<br/>\nthis week she was chosen to be a apart of an all Female Art Show at a local<br/>\nart studio.  First time her painting has been in a gallery for sale.  Did I<br/>\nmentioned she was the youngest artist! :-)  She had so many people stop by<br/>\nher painting to talk with her.  She handed out several business cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the most part she is a very introverted and shy person.  But she really<br/>\ncame out of her comfort zone this week.  I have just stood and watched in<br/>\namazement as she has interacted with others this week.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have watched her shine this week, I thought to myself.  Wow, what if my<br/>\ndh and I had never found unschooling?  How different our dd&#39;s lives would be<br/>\nright now.  I spoke to a couple artist the other night and asked them how<br/>\nlong they had been painting.  I have heard several adult artist tell me they<br/>\nonly pencil drew until they were grown and on there own because there<br/>\nparents didn&#39;t want to the mess of paint in their home.  I have had so many<br/>\npeople tell me what wonderful parents my dh and I are for allowing both of<br/>\nour girls to pursue there passions.  Several of them have told Rachael<br/>\n(14yo) she has no idea how lucky she is and that because of the young start<br/>\nshe has gotten she will go farther then most.<br/>\n<br/>\nO.K. I am proud!  Can I be proud of myself for pushing through the doubts to<br/>\nget to where we are?  Can I be proud of not just me but of both my dh and<br/>\nmyself for being together on this journey?  I have been wearing a big smile<br/>\nthis week. My almost 11yo has done really great things too, but I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto make this a novel! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you who wonder...&quot;am I doing the right thing?&quot;....keep doing<br/>\nit!  Don&#39;t stop working on self growth so that your children will follow<br/>\nsuit.   The public school system is trying to raise self sufficient human<br/>\nbeings who can be great leaders but I say we have the corner on that one!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for allowing me to share one of my proud Momma moments! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoying the journey,<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey I. - S.C. - Mom to Rachael (13) & Madison (10)<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition.<br/>\nVersion: 7.1.405 / Virus Database: 268.10.10/418 - Release Date: 8/14/2006</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16582,"nextTopicId":16588}}
