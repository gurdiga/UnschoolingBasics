Don&#39;t force him to trust others, rather do all you can to be SURE he knows he can trust you.  The analogy is that if his core (learning trust, love, protection, etc) isn&#39;t solidly developed, all learning afterward will be built on a misshapen core and thus not develop propperly untill he can go back and re-learn those core values...and that is VERY hard.  I&#39;m not saying this to make you feel bad, but to explain why this may be a very real problem for him and one that may not go away quickly if it has shaken him that deeply.  We all make mistakes and have to take back promises, etc at times, but the biggest thing we can do for our kids (aside from avoiding them in the first place) is to own up completely for our own shortcomings.  They learn that we love them, that we are still honest, that we don&#39;t break promises without a REALLY good reason, and that we feel badly for what we&#39;ve done...and this in turn helps them to become trustworthy people who can also accept that they too will have faults and make mistakes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that made sense.

That person should never be working with children!  That is offensive and if it was outside of school wouldn&#39;t the person have been arrested?  I know hindsight is 20/20 and calling the police on the principal can&#39;t be done now...but what if you had had a doctor&#39;s appointment at that time and she was refusing you to take the child?  Talk about child abuse....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the advice so far is great.  Apologizing is HUGE.  I love the anger fantasies too.  I had a situation where the teacher refused to let my son go to the bathroom and he peed himself and then she called me to bring him new clothes, but wanted him to come back with them (they were supposed to be performing someplace).  I was furious and told she and the principal so.  I think they were afraid of me, I am almost 6 ft tall...but I was so angry to think that this stupid woman would not believe my son really had to go to the bathroom.  She even said something about how kids don&#39;t always need to go when they say they do.  So I asked her point blank, &quot;has my son EVER given you the idea that he would LIE to you&quot; she was very shocked and admitted he wouldn&#39;t.  If we hadn&#39;t been in the process of moving away I would have taken the case further.  The principal apologized, the teacher is still there humiliating other kids. :(  I apologized to my son and we have discussed it many times.  His embarrassment, his anger, his wish to pee on the teacher instead of himself, etc.  I think those things really do help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may take years to get over that one incident, and there may be others you are not aware of because you didn&#39;t witness them.  Maybe he needs to talk about them but is afraid you will be angry with him or think he did something wrong or to deserve the behavior of the insane adult.  I never told my parents all the things I went through in elementary school because I thought I MUST have done something wrong to get that behavior from a teacher.  (hand whacked for poor handwriting, having to sit next to the teacher&#39;s desk so they could hit me if my writing wasn&#39;t good enough, then stuffed in a corner and told to wait for the class to catch up to me in reading/history/etc because I was &quot;too far ahead&quot;, told I couldn&#39;t learn multiplication-even though I already was and loving it--until I got all my addition and subtraction of 9s right all the time....etc etc etc).  Children fear making their parents angry or causing them to not be &quot;proud&quot;, so we keep it inside and don&#39;t talk about it.  He may need to talk and tell you of other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I am rambling now as I think about the past and it has me angry again.  I am thankful I can give my kids something better now and that we can work together to help each other through these things.  Thanks for sharing your post--I hope we have helped.

Sometimes, when it&#39;s hard to let something go, it&#39;s a sign that it&#39;s triggering those unresolved childhood feelings. It&#39;s an opportunity to go within, ask &quot;What&#39;s really going on, here?&quot; and be open to where that takes us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a delicate balance of being in today, taking responsibility for your happiness NOW, not blaming the past for staying stuck, and still opening yourself to look at those things. To ask, &quot;What other times in my life did I feel powerless and angry? When in my past did authority keep me from doing what I knew was right in my gut?&quot;, let that little you tell you HER truth, and do the healing work to let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts with compassion for who and where you were a year and a half ago. Someone years ago gave me a wonderful image: Right now, when you look within, you might not even see yourself, your truth. Trust that it&#39;s there. Keep looking. Every time you get a chance to ask, &quot;Is this MY truth?&quot; do so. If it&#39;s not, speak your truth, and hold firm. The more you do that, the more of YOU will be revealed, every time you look. Learn to trust yourself. It&#39;s been over 20 years since she said that to me, and I can say, it has borne out. It took practice, and time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne wonderful way to make amends to your son is to not put him in a position like that again, and do what you can to support him following HIS heart and gut. So when he&#39;s an adult, he won&#39;t have a loss of self, he won&#39;t be put in the same position. Let him speak up. Listen to him. Support his choices wholeheartedly.<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Seeking suggestions","postDate":"1249561330","msgId":40926,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZCMzdCNDU3MzZCODRCM0Y4ODUwRTk5OThFNUJCQUJDQGJpZ3N1cnByaXNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":40924,"nextInTopic":40928,"prevInTime":40925,"nextInTime":40927,"topicId":40916,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I m looking for ideas on how to help my son and myself deal with the anger, to help me forgive myself and for ideas of how to lay this to rest and move","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1343210472\">***I&#39;m looking for ideas on how to help my son and myself deal with the anger, to<br/>\nhelp me forgive myself and for ideas of how to lay this to rest and move on.***<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son can&#39;t be done with it until you are.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he brings it up again, tell him you should have stopped her and taken him home and that you won&#39;t let anyone do that to him again.

Whats done is done, however children can something think -&#39;Why did Mum leave me and not stick up for me&#39; type thing.  Im not saying this to make you feel bad, as who knows how any of us would react in such a circumstance, other than I can tell you my blood is boiling just thinking about it - for both of you.  I would tell him that you feel really bad that you didnt do something, take him out, slug her one LOl or whatever, and that you would do things differently if you had the time over again.  Maybe it would make him laugh if you imagined something else happening....  Like you sluged her in the nose, hung the clock around her neck and attached her to the flag pole or something.  Maybe write her a letter telling her what a .........  she is from your son and yourself (you dont have to send it, but Id be tempted to, just so she knows how she has effected someone that long ago).  As long as your son knows that you are sorry that you didnt protect him and you learnt from that experience also.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH, and blessings to all of you,  Camille  :D<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: srmccann2003 <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, August 06, 2009 7:26 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Seeking suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Some of you may remember that my son experienced some traumatic events in public school in K and then the begining of 1st grade.
