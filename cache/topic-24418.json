I would also like to ask if anyone else has seen anything <br/>\nsimilar with their own families.<br/>\n<br/>\nDd 9 came out of ps in Jan. to homeschool with a charter school.  Ds <br/>\n15 was a freshman at high school.  We discovered unschooling a few <br/>\nmonths ago and both kids got really excited about it.  To make a long <br/>\nstory short, ds wanted to finish the year at school but when 3 of his <br/>\nclassmates committed suicide, he changed his mind and left school <br/>\nabout a month ago.  Dd also left her homeschool program at that <br/>\ntime.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I am quite surprised at how productive they have been <br/>\nalready.  I fully expected them to lay on the couch for days and <br/>\nweeks at a time, but that has not happened.  They are doing all kinds <br/>\nof things and want to do more.  They have so many ideas of things <br/>\nthey want to do, I am hoping I can keep up with them!  I am really <br/>\nencouraging them to just take the summer and swim and see movies and <br/>\nplay games.  They seem a little bored and sad when we aren&#39;t doing <br/>\nsomething more than that though.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I never realized how compensated they had become in order to <br/>\nsurvive in school.  Now that they are home, and don&#39;t need their <br/>\nschool persona, I am seeing vulnerabilities that I didn&#39;t know were <br/>\nthere.  I can see the layers slowly start to come off and it&#39;s <br/>\nfascinating.   I am getting a much better idea of what school was <br/>\nlike for them now that they aren&#39;t in it.  I am really aware of how <br/>\nimportant it is for me to make sure home is really a safe place all <br/>\nthe time.  Not that it isn&#39;t, but I now don&#39;t think that the kind of <br/>\nbanter and teasing we used to do with each other is ok anymore.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThird, they have both come to me in the last week and asked for more <br/>\nlimits.  Ds flat out told me he is not comfortable with no limits.  <br/>\nHe said it makes him nervous and anxious like I am no longer there <br/>\nfor him.   They have both made themselves sick by eating too much and <br/>\nhave both gained weight.   Food was one of those things that was an <br/>\nissue for me growing up and still is as an adult, so it follows that <br/>\nI made it an issue for them.  When we go to the market now, I buy <br/>\nanything they ask for.  We don&#39;t buy junk food because none of us <br/>\nlike it, but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t buy cookies and ice cream <br/>\netc.  Both kids told me they are not ready to control their own <br/>\neating.  I told them I would not tell them what to do but if they <br/>\nasked me my opinion, I would give it to them.  My dd was on her knees <br/>\nwith her head in the toilet about to throw up and begging me to help <br/>\nher get control.  In the past, I would set limits on food like only <br/>\nhave 2 cookies or 1 helping is enough but not consistently.  <br/>\nI want them to learn how to be OK with their choices and how to make <br/>\nchoices that are healthy for their bodies, but I&#39;m not sure how to do <br/>\nthat at this point.  Any thoughts are much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I am so grateful to have found unschooling and I have <br/>\nalready learned so much from all of the wisdom on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nin peace,<br/>\nDianna<br/>\nthehomeopathicway.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24461,"nextTopicId":24419}}
