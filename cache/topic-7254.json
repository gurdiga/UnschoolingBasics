I love that <br/>\nquote: Well behaved women never made history.  I believe that I can <br/>\nmake the most change in the world by being outspoken about it, it <br/>\ngives people food for thought.  That is just my personality though, <br/>\nmore than anything.  I also now have the back of my van COVERED with <br/>\nbumper stickers that give people food for thought, at least some of <br/>\nthem probably go home and google unschooling!  I have actually had a <br/>\nlot of people move toward unschooling because I am so loud about it <br/>\nand that is the greatest thing!!!!!  One of my older friends (in her <br/>\n70&#39;s), whose husband was a college professer, says that he used to <br/>\ncomplain about how we coerce kids to &quot;learn&quot; when there is never <br/>\nreally any learning to be had, he would tell her how kids REALLY <br/>\nlearned and she said he was basically describing unschooling.  She <br/>\nis always telling me how lucky my kids are!  I am also lucky because <br/>\nI live in Alaska (for 7 more weeks anyway) and there are no <br/>\nhomeschool laws so no one really cares what you do, and there are <br/>\nTONS of very relaxed homeschoolers so unschooling isn&#39;t too far of a <br/>\nreach for most people.  When I do get raised eyebrows I always have <br/>\na come-back and a fierce argument for the pros of unschooling so <br/>\nmost people give up fairly quickly.  Last week, after a heated <br/>\nunschooling v. public schooling debate, the conversation drifted <br/>\ntowards the school schedule and testing.  The comment was made that <br/>\nthe schedule was changed so that all testing could be done before <br/>\nChristmas so that the kids wouldn&#39;t forget what they had &quot;learned&quot; <br/>\nbefore testing.  I just piped up and said &quot;Well that pretty much <br/>\ncements my argument because they didn&#39;t really LEARN it in the first <br/>\nplace then, did they?&quot;  The entire room was REALLY quiet (you could <br/>\nhave heard crickets chirping if we had any around) and I kind of <br/>\nthink that they won&#39;t argue with me about unschooling anymore. I am <br/>\nalways very nice about it though, I just give people my <br/>\nthoughts :) :)  I have inspired a number of people to research <br/>\nunschooling farther and a few have made the transition  and those <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t are at least a little more open minded about it, those <br/>\nare the greatest moments for me!  I completely understand the closet <br/>\nthing though because it can sometimes exhaust a person to explain, <br/>\nevery time, why you do things different; it is always a few hour <br/>\nconversation, ya know!?
