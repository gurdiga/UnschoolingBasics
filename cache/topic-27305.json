I have really enjoyed what the others in the <br/>\ngroup have shared. <br/>\n<br/>\nHi Courtney,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first became a mother, after many years of working, I had no <br/>\nidea what to do too. I had no passion, because everything i knew was <br/>\nabout work, about competition, about getting that deal that nobody <br/>\ncan. The only passion I have I supposed was shopping.  Diapers, baby <br/>\npoo and breastfeeding (milk machine was how I felt like, for a long <br/>\nwhile)....what a boring depressing world! What do I do now?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I bored. So toun-bored myself, I started reading lots of book/ <br/>\ninternet. Then I thought, I have so much time, what would I like to <br/>\ndo....oh I don&#39;t know. I like watching tv as I basically grew up being <br/>\nbabysat by my grandmother&#39;s tv. So maybe I&#39;ll watch all those movies <br/>\nthat I used to like when I was a child...so I did. I was watching <br/>\nSound of Music, Oliver Twist, Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs, Looney <br/>\nToons, etc etc etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like reading too, so I read and read all those Enid Blyton&#39;s books <br/>\nagain. Plus cosmopolitan, and vogue (drooling over all those shoes). I <br/>\nlove clothes, especially fascinated by those puff sleeves and balloon <br/>\nskirts, so I going thru books on periodic costumes. And I love shoes. <br/>\nSo I read books on shoes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like music, so every morning to get me into a good mood, I put on <br/>\nsomething I like. I was listening to Karen Carpenter for ages (my  <br/>\nhubby was carpentered-out LOL!) Then I remembered the Blue Danude by <br/>\nJohann Strauss, hence the start of my journey into classical music.<br/>\nThen I would light my incense, going from the smell of roses to <br/>\nsandelwood. And it is always a beautiful morning, no matter what. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I stayed in my pjs alot. I still do now, with my 7 yr old DS. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, all these were familiar smells and sounds of my childhood, <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve forgotten, but had fun re-discovering. Then things started <br/>\nto get busy as DS starts to crawl, walk, talk and run. Life started <br/>\ngetting interesting again. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen DS went to school, I was lost again, as I didn&#39;t know what to do, <br/>\nafter 5 years of being busy mum. All of a sudden I had huge chunks of <br/>\ntime on my hand, too much time! So the cycle starts again. The movies, <br/>\nthe books, the music, the incense. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we started to deschool towards unschooling, it was so scary and <br/>\nnew and unfamiliar, I gave myself permission to do nothing, until I&#39;m <br/>\nsure of something, as I didn&#39;t want to start doing the wrong things, <br/>\nwhich I&#39;ll have to un-do later on!!! So the cycle begins- watching son <br/>\nplaying on PS2 (movie), surfing on the net (books), X&#39;mas songs <br/>\n(music - me and son both love Xmas carols LOL!!), and smells (this <br/>\ntime is cooking) leads the way. This time, I dug deeper inside me- I <br/>\nreached for my inner child. So I told myself, pretend I&#39;m not mummy <br/>\nbut the little child I used to be. &quot;Deschooling our life&quot; will makes <br/>\nmore sense and is easier when I don&#39;t have to observe any &quot;good, <br/>\nsensible, what&#39;s right and what&#39;s not rules&quot; that have been in-<br/>\ndoctrined into my 37 yrs old brain and consiousness. And it did. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, go on. Give yourself that permission to do nothing, for a start. <br/>\nThen, dig thru those layers you&#39;ve built around yourself all these <br/>\nyears in college/ growing up.  You&#39;ll find your true self and passion <br/>\nagain, I promised!

I struggle with my kids watching tv all the<br/>\ntime, but it is only because I can&#39;t find anything to do with myself.<br/>\nEverything seems like such a chore. I&#39;m missing the joy! It was<br/>\neasier when I was focusing on the kids and convincing myself that if<br/>\nthey were &quot;learning&quot; then I was doing it right. I could point to it<br/>\nand say &quot;this is what I did today.&quot; Has anyone experienced this kind<br/>\nof unschooling depression? I know I am a creative, inspired,<br/>\ninteresting person in there somewhere, I just can&#39;t seem to find it.<br/>\nThis go round with unschooling I have realized that you have to walk<br/>\nthe walk and set the example for it to work. But how do I do that? I<br/>\ncan&#39;t expect my kids to be engaged and interested if I can&#39;t even<br/>\nmanage to do it. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen me and son first to homeschool/ de-school, I struggle too, <br/>\nthinking I have to buck-up and start planning lots of structures. I <br/>\npanic about timetables, about syllabus, about &quot;healthy balance of <br/>\ncurriculum&quot; blah blah blah.  And then I was lucky enough to stumble <br/>\nacross the idea of unschooling. Hey presto! It was like I was given <br/>\npermisssion to do nothing!!!! The idea that he&#39;ll naturally, un-<br/>\ndeniably learn what he wants, when he wants to,  just <br/>\nabsolutely &quot;free&quot; me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I think, &quot;ok, this is so cool, my child can learnt off me, <br/>\njust by me being myself - a living breathing being! But then I did <br/>\nstarted panicking, thinking &quot;OMG, I can get lazy, very very easily.  <br/>\nI can stay in my pjs the whole day, just lazing around the house. <br/>\nWhat if he pick that up?&quot; What do I do? Panic, panic....!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then being the lazy sort of person I am, I thought that I&#39;ll <br/>\nallow myself to get lazy first, for a certain period of time, kinda <br/>\nlike a break from being a well-planned homeschooling mum, to just be <br/>\na nice &quot;holiday fun mummy&quot;, before we get knuckle down to serious <br/>\nbusiness. Afterall, we are still de-schooling, a honeymoon period. <br/>\nNo hurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUt you see, it&#39;s because I allow myself not to do anything, set no <br/>\nexpectation to meet, but just relax and easy and be myself (I <br/>\nsuppose that was the expectation, wasn&#39;t it?), that I eventually got <br/>\nbored of doing nothing. My son was obviously descooling bigtime with <br/>\nhis PS2, and that did caused me big concerns, so I started reading <br/>\nalot on how to handle this. So I kinda thought since I have nothing <br/>\nin particular to do, I might as well deschool with him on the sofa, <br/>\nwhile he played, i&#39;ve surf the net, read my emails, read my <br/>\nmagazines, chat on the phone, ordered pizza in, eventually we <br/>\nthought it would be fun eating our picnic at the park. When I got a <br/>\nbetter grip about the PS2 situation (basically I got had enough and <br/>\ngot bored reading all those research articles LOL!), I then started <br/>\npainting while son is still stuck on PS2. There were times when <br/>\nhe&#39;ll run over and paint me a few pictures of the game he&#39;s playing, <br/>\nnarrating what&#39;s going thru him mind at tha time. I supposed if he&#39;s <br/>\ntaking it all in, he&#39;ll have to de-tox it out, right? So the <br/>\npainting session turned out ot be a very good therapeutic pit stop <br/>\nfor him, and me. I&#39;ve picked up my knitting that&#39;s been left lying <br/>\naround for a long while, curled up next to him. Put on my favourite <br/>\nmusic, from classical to abba to Boney M, to cheer me on, while I <br/>\nexperiment with new recipes. Sometimes, he&#39;ll come over for a <br/>\ntester, and will give me either a thumbs up, or down. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you see, what I&#39;m trying to say (in a very long winded way LOL!) <br/>\nis just give yourself the permission to do nothing! It&#39;s ok, not <br/>\nhaving to do anything for the children, just for now. Just do things <br/>\nfor yourself, even if it means staying in your pjs and snuggling <br/>\nnext to your kids, and watch what they&#39;re watching. If cartoons is <br/>\nnot your cup of tea, find a book, a magazine or anything that you <br/>\ncan do, while next to/ near them. I did my ironing alot too. This <br/>\nled to an hour long session of son playing with the iron, leading to <br/>\ndiscussion of steam and experimenting &quot;funneling&quot; the steam to move <br/>\na paper fan. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope my &quot;funny way&quot; of melting into unschooling helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nSharon.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: unschooling myself","postDate":"1193286433","msgId":27318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZmcDV2MSs4bm5kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZmb2w2dSs1NnEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":27315,"nextInTopic":27324,"prevInTime":27317,"nextInTime":27319,"topicId":27305,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~So I am reading about all these home/unschooled kids who do amazing things (in recomended books) while I watch my son play PS2.

I just have <br/>\nso much doubt and fear and guilt. My son (7) had such a hard time at <br/>\nschool, homeschooling was the only realistic answer. I was in my last <br/>\nsemester of college and took some time off. I have been in school <br/>\npretty much my entire life (13 yrs of trad school and then 7+ yrs of <br/>\ncollege) so now I have really no idea what to do with myself.<br/>\nMy existance revolved around school then my son. I have no idea what <br/>\nmy own passions are. I am even convinced what I went to school for <br/>\nall those years isn&#39;t for me. <br/>\nSo I am reading about all these home/unschooled kids who do amazing <br/>\nthings (in recomended books) while I watch my son play PS2. Then I go <br/>\nand watch some crappy tv show. It is rather depressing :)<br/>\nI guess the issue is unschooling myself and how one goes about doing <br/>\nso.<br/>\nI hope I haven&#39;t come off negative or whatever. I have reservations <br/>\nabout posting to the groups because I am afraid I will come off the <br/>\nwrong way.
