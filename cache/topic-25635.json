We have 5 desktops and 2 laptops...<br/>\nvarious folks have given us parts over the years and it&#39;s hubby&#39;s<br/>\nhobby to put the various parts together to make a working system...<br/>\nsometimes he gives them to folks he knows that need a computer (single<br/>\nparents, special ed classrooms etc) or if one of the kids has a need<br/>\nthat requires a better sound card or video card etc he pieces together<br/>\nanother system that fits that need.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have two big tv&#39;s one upstairs and one downstairs in each of<br/>\nthe family rooms, both younger kids have a tv in their room and we<br/>\nhave a tv in our room.   The older kids enjoy having a tv room<br/>\ndownstairs so they can watch things that the littles don&#39;t want to see<br/>\nor find too scary or mature.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have video games in various places... one upstairs one downstairs<br/>\nand one child upstairs has their own in her room because that is her<br/>\nneed.   There are bookshelves in every room stuffed with books and<br/>\ninteresting things, stacks of board games in various places, legos,<br/>\nknex, Playmobil, craft supplies, math manipulatives, science<br/>\nexperiment books and supplies, cookbooks, reference books etc all in<br/>\nvarious places in our house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur house is NEVER clean... it&#39;s just NOT, we have busy clutter<br/>\neverywhere but it&#39;s what works for us.  We have a fairly spacious<br/>\nhouse and my kids like to spread out to pursue their various<br/>\ninterests,  the two older girls share a room downstairs where they<br/>\nhave their own tv room, bathroom etc (they currently say if I would<br/>\nput a fridge and microwave down there they would never have to come<br/>\nupstairs! HA!)  they chose not to have a tv in their bedroom since<br/>\nthey have a tv room (so we put one tv in storage) and because they<br/>\nboth wanted the option for their bedroom to be a quiet refuge if<br/>\neither needed it to be (without negotiating with each other about it<br/>\nbeing on or off etc)    <br/>\n<br/>\nI kind of think of my entire house as an unschooling pantry and make<br/>\nsure it&#39;s stocked with interesting things all the time.  I sort of<br/>\ndrift during the day to various areas to see what they are doing, they<br/>\ndrift back and forth as they need me or need something they can&#39;t find.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think that it&#39;s vital for each family to figure out what scheme<br/>\nworks for their family... if no one in your family likes clutter they<br/>\naren&#39;t going to find our scheme comfortable, if things were too<br/>\norderly my family wouldn&#39;t find it comfortable for their style, some<br/>\nfolks prefer that tv always be a group activity (that&#39;s their time to<br/>\nsnuggle on the couch and enjoy something together)  My kids use tv in<br/>\nvarying ways so while my 6 yr old often proclaims a certain night<br/>\n&quot;family watch a movie together night&quot;  or &quot;father and son movie<br/>\nwatching night&quot; typically everyone has different things they enjoy<br/>\nwatching individually.  One tv wouldn&#39;t work for my family but might<br/>\nwork wonderfully for someone else.<br/>\n   <br/>\nI think if you were to walk into any unschooler&#39;s home you would find<br/>\nsomething different.   The beauty of unschooling just like<br/>\nhomeschooling in general is that each person can do what works for<br/>\nthem and their family.   Now if I could just get my garage cleaned out<br/>\nfor the indoor playground I want to make my life would be perfect!<br/>\nLisa Blocker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Set up of an Unschooling house","postDate":"1186669794","msgId":25637,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2OEQwQzU3LTVEMUItNEE3My1CMjYwLTFBREY2NDZCQkRCQUBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQyRkQ4OEIyLTA3RjctNDdBMi04RjY3LTlENDQ5NzQ2QTgzREBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEQyRkQ4OEIyLTA3RjctNDdBMi04RjY3LTlENDQ5NzQ2QTgzREBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25657,"prevInTime":25636,"nextInTime":25638,"topicId":25635,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have everything spread out, because there are so many of us that it really impeded on others to have a loud TV on in the middle of the house.

So, in one corner of the basement, is the TV room and the room  <br/>\nnext to that has most of the toys and crafts. We (ok, me, dh kind of  <br/>\ncame home and said &quot;Bored today?&quot;)  cut a hole in the wall between so  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a doorway of sorts between the two (actually, it&#39;s more like  <br/>\na hobbit hole). Everyone has a computer in their room, it was worth  <br/>\nthe money (haha, we bought them at university overflow sales for way  <br/>\ncheap) so that everyone had the opportunity to play. So the TV room,  <br/>\nplay room and girls bedrooms are in the basement. The boys rooms are  <br/>\non the first floor with the kitchen and dining room, but those just  <br/>\nhave our music setup, so not a lot to play with there. except sam and  <br/>\ndan&#39;s room, with the hotwheels and knex,  and Josh&#39;s room has a  <br/>\nsecond TV with the n64 and wii, no cable though. They just migrate  <br/>\nthrough the house, moving to what&#39;s most interesting at the time. I  <br/>\nspend a LOT of time running back and forth, up and down. I should be  <br/>\nmuch skinnier. I look at it as having stations, we just rotate  <br/>\nthroughout the day. It&#39;s kind of nice, keeps things interesting.<br/>\nWhy not move her kitchen and craft stuff to the basement?
