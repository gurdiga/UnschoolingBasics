We don&#39;t know what the professors said in their letters, <br/>\nbut the advisor called and practically begged Laurie to attend <br/>\nschool there. He then got together with whomever and they created a <br/>\ngraduate assistantship for Laurie so that ALL of her living expenses <br/>\nand school costs will be paid for as long as she chooses to attend. <br/>\nHe called several times after that and said, &quot;Are you SURE you&#39;re <br/>\nREALLY going to attend our school? We are SO happy that you have <br/>\nchosen us.&quot; And to think she wondered at first if she&#39;d be accepted. <br/>\nJust as Kelly said, good universities realize what a pleasure an <br/>\nunschooled person is in classes. <br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141910957,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valerie@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: questions","postDate":"1090032001","msgId":2182,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkYTNpMStvZXFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFjYS4yNWQxYzBkYi4yZTI3MzEwN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2181,"nextInTopic":2183,"prevInTime":2181,"nextInTime":2183,"topicId":2043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... by our  own ... ***** I m trying so hard to think of something witty to say about being our own experienced mom, but I m sleepy sleepy sleepy. love,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-26036309\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; Maybe you should try Valerie&#39;s book then? _The Unprocessed Child_ <br/>\n </span></blockquote>by our  own <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; experienced mom, Valerie Fitzenreiter.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***** I&#39;m trying so hard to think of something witty to say about <br/>\nbeing &quot;our&quot; own experienced mom, but I&#39;m sleepy sleepy sleepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141910957,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valerie@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: questions","postDate":"1090031591","msgId":2181,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNkYTM1NytoZjBiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzE1MDAxNzE1LjMyNDM2LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzOTAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2149,"nextInTopic":2182,"prevInTime":2180,"nextInTime":2182,"topicId":2043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter Laurie took the ACT test then registered and she was in.

I came to a realization, that if school did that to him,,why would I do school-at-home?  It wasn&#39;t working.  Why would I replicate that?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first started homeschooling I thought if I was excited enough about a subject I could sell it to my kids.  My subject *I* thought was exciting was Mardi Gras.  We sat down together, ds was 8 at the time, dd was 6, and we read about Mardi Gras, New Orleans, Fat Tuesday,  made masks and I was really proud of myself.  Thought they really learned a lot!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, about a week later someone asked us how our homeschooling was going.  I answered, &quot;Great, we just did a unit study on Mardi Gras.  Right kids?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids answer, &quot;huh??&quot;  Me,&quot;You know Mardi Gras, New Orleans, remember?&quot;  Kids,&quot;huh?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, starting to get a bit embarrassed, &quot;you know when we made those cool masks and learned about Mardi Gras??&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Oooohhh,  yeah, we made these really cool masks!&quot; my kids answered.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey had no idea what Mardi Gras was,  they didn&#39;t remember anything about New Orleans or Fat Tuesday.  Point being, they really weren&#39;t interested at all in the history of Mardi Gras.  They had some fun with the craft and that&#39;s what they, or my dd anyway, remembered.  My son didn&#39;t even want to make a mask so he totally didn&#39;t get anything out of it.  Just more of an untrusting moment for his mother. :(<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRight there I realized that my kids heads were not empty vessels that I could fill up.  They were going to learn what they wanted to learn, when they wanted to learn it.     I never looked back.  I also found unschooling.com through some books and from there found Holt, Sandra Dodd, and lots of other resources.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI read, and read, and read.  For about 3 days I would stay up into the middle of the night.  There were so many topics that started to come into my head.  I knew it wasn&#39;t going to stop at our &quot;educational&quot; approach. :)  Its our life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son&#39;s light is back, and its as bright as ever.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  Oh, I was going to mention.  One thing I did do when I started unschooling was keep a journal.  I, at first, worried if they would learn certain, (ok, yuck,) &quot;subjects&quot;. I wrote down in &quot;educationese&quot; the things my kids were learning.  After watching them for about a week, with no interference from me, I was amazed at what they learned.   They learned from: TV, movies, video games, magazines,  other types of games; and playing, playing and more playing.  I journaled: math, geography, language arts, science, phy ed, history,  it goes on and on.  I was convinced. :)  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneva Goza &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:goza@...\">goza@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nWhy did YOU decide to unschool?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am asking this because I am new to the concept...yet sold.

We were at a magic convention January  22, <br/>\n  and Cameron had a big project due that Monday. On our way to the show  that <br/>\n  night, I reminded him that he had the project to finish. He said, &quot;You  know, Mom, <br/>\n  if you homeshcooled me I wouldn&#39;t have to do it by Monday.&quot; I  snarkily <br/>\n  answered back, &quot;You think you&#39;re busy NOW! Just think if I homeschooled  your <br/>\n  butt!&quot; And we walked on to the show.&lt;g&gt; He stayed up until 5:00 that  morning doing <br/>\n  magic with some of the biggest names in magic, and the following  day (his <br/>\n  13th birthday) he participated in a one-on-one workshop with the  headliner, <br/>\n  Jeff McBride. He didn&#39;t go to school on Monday! &lt;G&gt; He got a  letter grade lower <br/>\n  for handing his project in a day late.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But that got me thinking. The month of February, my husband was out of town  <br/>\n  for reserve duty. While he was gone, I went to the library and checked out <br/>\n  every  book on homeschooling that they had. One of the books had a section on  <br/>\n  unschooling and a website (_www.unschooling.com_ (http://www.unschooling.com) ) <br/>\n  which really  intrigued me. It also mentioned John Holt. I went back to the <br/>\n  library and  checked all HIS books out. Meanwhile, I also contacted every <br/>\n  curriculum dealer  I could find. YIKES! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, armed to the teeth with dog-eared books, a stack of curriculum  <br/>\n  catalogues waist high(!), and a beautifully worded argument----I was ready for  *every* <br/>\n  question he could ask, I approached Ben as son as he walked in the door  with <br/>\n  &quot;Honey, I think we should homeschool the boys.&quot;  Ben says, &quot;OK.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Damn---ALL that work! &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, I spent months on the message boards reading every word, going back  <br/>\n  to the archives and reading some more. I read every single message written on  <br/>\n  the boards. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I was on the parents&#39; board at school. In April, we had a big,  important <br/>\n  meeting about next year&#39;s curriculum. The headmaster was saying that  he thought <br/>\n  we needed to cut back on the arts and beef up the computer/technology  <br/>\n  curricula. At that, I was outa there!<br/>\n<br/>\n  By then we were committed to the idea of homeschooling. We kept him in  <br/>\n  school until the end. Looking back, I SOOO wish that I&#39;d just pulled him o-u-t,  <br/>\n  but we let him ride out the school year. I was still figuring out the  <br/>\n  unschooling thang. I understood the theory, I just couldn&#39;t put it into  practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son was nagged the first few months. I would let him &quot;do nothing&quot;,  but he <br/>\n  had to write an essay on what he&#39;d done on our trip to Savannah---or draw  a <br/>\n  picture of the story I read to him---or I&#39;d point out that packing the car was <br/>\n  geometry. Got to the point that he didn&#39;t want to *go* anywhere,  do <br/>\n  anything, or be read to! Bummer. <br/>\n<br/>\n  So I listened to Sandra and Joyce and Anne and Mary and others on the  <br/>\n  boards. I quit nagging. Cold turkey. Just quit. I let him do what he needed to  do. <br/>\n  I let him eat, sleep, watch tv, and talk with friends on the phone. And  <br/>\n  that&#39;s ALL he did for MONTHS. Months and months!<br/>\n<br/>\n  But he was healing. I kept asking whether he&#39;d like to go with me and his  <br/>\n  brother to the zoo or the museum or the beach or whereever. One day he said,  <br/>\n  &quot;Yes.&quot; I was floored, but I just smiled and said, &quot;Great---meet you in the  car.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  We&#39;ve never looked back. He had finally healed from the  school-damage---and <br/>\n  has been so busy lately, he has to keep a daytimer!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do unschooler Mothers ever work outside the  home?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have put on two conferences, so that&#39;s not outside the home, but I was  <br/>\n  hardly &quot;available&quot; for several months each year. I also groom dogs, but I do  <br/>\n  that in a groom room in my garage. I work probably 12 hours/week on the dogs.  <br/>\n  For a while, I had a gig where I groomed 9 poodles every week at the home of a  <br/>\n  very wealthy couple. The boys knew where I was and had my number and Ben&#39;s  <br/>\n  number, as well as all the neighbors&#39; info. That goldmine fell though when they  <br/>\n  lost all their $$ in the stock market. Bummer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What about SATs?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I took them twice. My scores went up both times.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If Cam wants to take them, we&#39;ll get online programs and workbooks. He&#39;ll  <br/>\n  work on that just as he does anything he&#39;s interested in---and he&#39;ll take them  <br/>\n  as often as he wants to to get the scores as high as he wants them to be. I  <br/>\n  think the SATs are such a complete non-issue! Not just in an unschooling home,  <br/>\n  but that they should be in *every* home. It&#39;s a standardized test, for Holt&#39;s <br/>\n  sake! &lt;g&gt; Get a book!<br/>\n<br/>\n  ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

He had finally healed from the  school-damage---and <br/>\nhas been so busy lately, he has to keep a daytimer!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do unschooler Mothers ever work outside the  home?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have put on two conferences, so that&#39;s not outside the home, but I was  <br/>\nhardly &quot;available&quot; for several months each year. I also groom dogs, but I do  <br/>\nthat in a groom room in my garage. I work probably 12 hours/week on the dogs.  <br/>\nFor a while, I had a gig where I groomed 9 poodles every week at the home of a  <br/>\nvery wealthy couple. The boys knew where I was and had my number and Ben&#39;s  <br/>\nnumber, as well as all the neighbors&#39; info. That goldmine fell though when they  <br/>\nlost all their $$ in the stock market.

I am <br/>\nhoping to cut back in about a year from 3- 12hour night shifts a week to 2  a <br/>\nweek.  If you can find something that is flexible with scheduling, it is  <br/>\npossible to work and unschool or even do school at home (horrors!).<br/>\n <br/>\nWe came to unschooling after reading David Alberts book _And The Skylark  <br/>\nSings With Me_ and hearing him talk in person. I saw my 12yo change in  school.  <br/>\nHe was learning just fine before school without any pushing on our  part.  He <br/>\nsurprised us so much with what he knew that we thought school  would be a <br/>\nbreeze.  Not so.  It&#39;s one thing to learn something because  you want to know and <br/>\nanother thing to learn something because someone told you  that you HAD to <br/>\nwhether you wanted to or not.  I think he resisted some  things he may have liked <br/>\nif they hadn&#39;t been forced on him.  <br/>\n <br/>\nCheryl in FL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] questions","postDate":"1089840775","msgId":2044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGYwMWM0NjllYSQyMDQxMjMyMCQ2NzAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PDAxN2EwMWM0NjllNSRmNTY0MTI2MCRhNzlkMzJkOEBnb3phPg=="},"prevInTopic":2043,"nextInTopic":2047,"prevInTime":2043,"nextInTime":2045,"topicId":2043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We decided to unschool because when my daughter turned five and we were ready to begin homeschooling (we were going to do the Well Trained Mind approach) -","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-194662929\">We decided to unschool because when my daughter turned five and we were ready to &quot;begin&quot; homeschooling (we were going to do the Well Trained Mind approach) - we realized that she had been learning just fine without me &quot;making&quot; her learn and that to try make her learn would be both ineffective and counterproductive and detrimental to our relationship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me a while to really get it though -- around that same time she picked up a &quot;Bob&quot; book at her cousin&#39;s house and was delighted that she could read.  She wanted me to buy a set.  I did.  Then I thought that it would be nice to read one together every day so that she could get some steady reading &quot;practice.&quot;  I do not know what I was thinking.  I never &quot;forced&quot; her to -- it was cajoling and gentle reminders -- so it wasn&#39;t as harmful as it could have been, but it did no good for her learning or our relationship.  It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks before I came to my senses. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is now 6.5 - still uninterested in reading practice, but sometimes asking for the spelling of things she wants to write, sometimes inventing spelling, sometimes just asking me to write for her, sometimes reading some words she needs for computer games, sometimes asking me to read for her  -- in short behaving perfectly normally. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe come from an attachment parenting background of the respect for children as human beings variety (IMO that is not always true of AP parents) - so we already didn&#39;t control her food or her bedtimes, etc., and we already did not have chores, or punishments, or consequences, or time-outs, etc.  We were used to communicating with her as a person.   That, I think, made it very easy for us to realize the ridiculousness of trying to control her discovery of math.<br/>\n<br/>\nSATS?  If/when she or her younger brother wants to take them, they may decide to take a prep course -- or they may already be pretty well prepared - based on what their interests.  I know that I was surprised and delighted to learn when I took the LSATs (for law school) that an important and much feared part of the test was a kind of game (logic games) that I had always done for fun (having started doing them with my mother well before I went to school).  Needless to say I did extremely well on them.  It had nothing to do with my  experiences school.  I did well on the LSATS and in law school because that is the kind of mind I have - we were well suited to each other. The same was true for practicing the kind of corporate law I practiced.  I would have done less well as a trusts and estates lawyer -- it is a different mindset, and I would have done less well still as say, a substance-abuse counselor, or a first-grade teacher.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children do and will have interests and they will have time  and support to pursue them and I fully expect they will therefor be the kind of people and have done the kinds of things that will prepare them for whatever formal education in those interests they wish to pursue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI dont&#39; work outside the house (quit when my daughter was born) and don&#39;t expect to work for anyone else outside the house until my children leave home (I may or may not start a small business with a friend of mine).
