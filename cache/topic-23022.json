Unschooling is about expanding<br/>\nour world.<br/>\n<br/>\nClassical music isn&#39;t inherently better than any other style of music,<br/>\nnor does it lead to more/better learning experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nNature walks are great, if they&#39;re allowed to be enjoyed by each<br/>\nperson rather than turned into some kind of &quot;lesson&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone showed me a picture and took it away, asking me to tell<br/>\nthem about it, I&#39;d be really annoyed. Unschooling is all about<br/>\nauthentic interactions. If moments are contrived in order to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>\nor get information into our children that WE think is important, we<br/>\nmiss the more important things that THEY think are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to get to unschooling, take a deep breathe and realize<br/>\nthat Charlotte Mason was one person, with her own ideas and prejudices<br/>\nabout what is proper and good to learn. She had some great ideas too.<br/>\nThe problem I see with any learning method that places certain<br/>\nactivities as more valuable, is it misses the point that the child<br/>\nright in front of us has their own interests that may or may not<br/>\ncoincide with that method.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing for me is to assist my children in exploring<br/>\nthe world in their own way.
