The genetic syndrome she has<br/>\ncan cause serious mental health issues (bipolar, schizophrenia,<br/>\nirreversible psychosis and other scary issues)that don&#39;t respond<br/>\neasily to treatment unless treated early.     <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were living with a child (I was also in a very different place as a<br/>\nparent in those days being a former teacher and having children<br/>\nenrolled in schools and was overwhelmed with what I did NOT know) <br/>\nthat spent her days engaging in &quot;play&quot; that seemed strange to us<br/>\n..lining things up all over the house and then completely melting down<br/>\nif they were accidentally moved or knocked over by others.  We knew<br/>\ninstinctively that she needed to do that and that she needed a place<br/>\nto do it but I do have other children who deserved to be able to live<br/>\nin their house too and play and not be on pins and needles worrying<br/>\nabout knocking something over they hadn&#39;t realized was important.  We<br/>\nneeded tools to know how to all live in peace... that part was NOT<br/>\ninstinctual to me at that place in my life.   <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had specific ways that things had to be done to prevent a meltdown<br/>\nbut she was nonverbal so she couldn&#39;t tell us what she wanted or<br/>\nneeded.  I didn&#39;t know about picture communication cards or other<br/>\nthings that would give her a way to communicate so I could figure out<br/>\nhow she needed things to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could not access the best information and help that I needed to<br/>\nlearn about how to help her without having a diagnosis for her.   I<br/>\nread everything I could find, talked to everyone I could access and<br/>\neverything else before I sought a diagnosis.   The BEST help I could<br/>\nget for my child required something to call it.   I was willing and<br/>\nwould still be willing to put her through a day of playing with<br/>\ntherapists to determine if she fit the diagnosis if it helped her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the right therapy for our child and the right tools for our child<br/>\nwe know have a happy child...she still has autism (still has brown<br/>\neyes too ;-)   )  But we know more about her ... I NEEDED that<br/>\ninformation to focus what I did and what I learned so that I could<br/>\nhelp her.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo a simple answer was that &quot;I&quot; needed to be able to focus my energy<br/>\non helping her and meeting her where she was and to do that I needed<br/>\nto know what I was dealing with.   I never thought she was lazy or<br/>\ndefiant or needed to accomplish x and Y by a certain age... I did fear<br/>\nthat I would lose her to the mental health challenges that can come<br/>\nwith her genetic syndrome.  I was trying to empower ME so that I could<br/>\nhelp her. I had lots of advice from friends and family ...some good<br/>\nsome bad.  Her having a &quot;label&quot; for our family helps us get the<br/>\nservices, support and help for her that we could not afford or<br/>\nphysically provide without it.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes in the place that I am today I would not need a label... I<br/>\nwould know more about where to find help without a label, I would know<br/>\nhow to help all of my children exist on the same planet without<br/>\nsomeone else telling me (although isn&#39;t that why we are all here on<br/>\nthis list ?  )  I wouldn&#39;t need as many professional therapists<br/>\nbecause I would be able to access that information without them.  In<br/>\n1998 when she was 3 there was alot less awareness, alot less<br/>\ninformation publicly available, alot less education for parents, and<br/>\nfrankly just alot less known about autism.   I also wasn&#39;t 41 yrs old<br/>\nand confident about my parenting ....I was 31 and not so sure I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t ruin my children without help!  ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa B<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; But why did you need to know?

There are positive and negative ways to handle<br/>\nlabels...luckily we had a very wise pediatrician who said &quot;well does<br/>\nthis just give a name to the difficulty or does it tell us something<br/>\nthat is helpful to the family?&quot;   He was very careful not to order<br/>\nstacks of &quot;tests&quot; and &quot;evaluations&quot; that just gave us names but things<br/>\nthat were helpful. <br/>\n   <br/>\nFor my family it was helpful to know that the reason my oldest had<br/>\ndifficulty still in 3rd grade with writing wasn&#39;t because she was<br/>\n&quot;lazy&quot; as the school wanted to say but that even at that age her fine<br/>\nmotor skills and upper body strength and endurance was equal to that<br/>\nof a typical 5 yr old.  That information helped us to find things to<br/>\ndo that helped her strengthen her body...she looked typically<br/>\ndeveloping to us physically although small in stature.   Without that<br/>\ninformation we may have eventually thought she just wasn&#39;t trying hard<br/>\nenough rather than just wasn&#39;t physically ready. <br/>\n  <br/>\nFor my family it was helpful to get a medical diagnosis of a genetic<br/>\ndisorder that my 3rd child was suspected of having.   When you are<br/>\nfighting hard to keep a child alive and faced with health crisis after<br/>\ncrisis and there&#39;s nothing to tell you why or what you are fighting<br/>\nit&#39;s helpful to know it has a name so you can plan for things.  <br/>\nKnowing she had this disorder gave us a list of health things to check<br/>\ninto so we could handle things before she was in another crisis that<br/>\nmay take her life.    <br/>\n<br/>\nLater knowing that she had an autism spectrum disorder also helped us<br/>\nto know why she learned differently so we could focus how we<br/>\ninteracted with her in a way that respected her as a person and helped<br/>\nher live a more comfortable life.    I knew when I asked her to bring<br/>\nsomething to me that no matter how many times she&#39;d seen a hairbrush,<br/>\nused a hairbrush and heard it called a hairbrush that because of the<br/>\nway her brain learned language that her brain may not have filed that<br/>\nin a place where she automatically knew what I was asking for.   I can<br/>\nread about autism spectrum disorders and know what to do to help her<br/>\nbe less overwhelmed in social situations and help her navigate in a<br/>\nway that helps her make connections with the people that she wants to<br/>\nconnect to.  Knowing that incidental learning is thought to rarely<br/>\nhappen in children that have autism spectrum disorders helped me to<br/>\nlook for situations where this was a problem for her.  Knowing that<br/>\nperhaps people on the spectrum don&#39;t generalize skills from one<br/>\nenvironment to another  well most of the time is also helpful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use her label to define who she is, she has lots of<br/>\nlabels...she is a wonderfully bright girl that draws beautifully,<br/>\nshe&#39;s funny and loving (unless you are her younger brother!)she has<br/>\nfriends, she is a cheerleader, she is a softball player and she just<br/>\nhappens to have an autism spectrum disorder... I use her label to help<br/>\nme learn about difficulties that are common to people with autism<br/>\nspectrum disorder so that I can help her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately the world is more kind when your 13 yr old is having a<br/>\nmeltdown in a store or other place when you can say &quot;thanks for your<br/>\nadvice but spanking does not cure autism&quot;.  Yes in a perfect world I<br/>\nwould never have to take her somewhere that causes a meltdown but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t live in that world and I do have to use &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;services&quot;<br/>\nfrom the government and other agencies because I do have 4 children<br/>\nwho all deserve my best.   I can not physically take care of her needs<br/>\nin a way that is respectful to her and take care of my other 3 in ways<br/>\nthat respect them and keep my sanity without help.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nasking for help makes someone a lesser person but a person who<br/>\nunderstands limitations of the body and mind and respects themselves<br/>\nenough to BE HERE for the long term.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that&#39;s my 2 cents worth (and more!)<br/>\nLisa Blocker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Discussion about labels","postDate":"1213018351","msgId":33663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxQTVGNDBDLTVCQjItNDJDNS1COTg4LUIyMDQ4QzNBREQ4Q0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2OUNCNkNGLTc5RkQtNDA2Qi05NTQ0LTdBQUM4NzkzQTExN0Bjb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNGUwMWM4Yzk5NSQ2MTNhNzQzMCQwMjAxYThjMEBiaWdzdXJwcmlzZT4gPGcyaHM3OCtoMWh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZTkxYzVkZTEwODA2MDgyMDU2dTIyZDhmZTcxbzZjZDEwNDAyYmZjNjdjOTFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw4QTk1RjY0NS1BQkYyLTQ3NjAtOTNDRS03NEE2NUYzOEM4M0RAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+IDw4NjlDQjZDRi03OUZELTQwNkItOTU0NC03QUFDODc5M0ExMTdAY294Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":33662,"nextInTopic":33665,"prevInTime":33662,"nextInTime":33664,"topicId":33637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Responding to my own post (how embarrassing) but I wanted to emphasize that the typical behaviors I listed below are necessarily bad, but developmental","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-714341505\">Responding to my own post (how embarrassing) but I wanted to  <br/>\nemphasize that the &#39;typical&#39; behaviors I listed below are necessarily  <br/>\nbad, but developmental stages in personal growth.

ALL kids have this problem with social cues...that&#39;s why  <br/>\nmainstream parents spend the first seven to eight years of every  <br/>\nchild&#39;s life punishing and rewarding them for behaviors. We just  <br/>\ndon&#39;t see it as unusual (the way autistic kids are viewed) because  <br/>\nwe&#39;ve come to expect those behaviors (lying, taking things without  <br/>\nasking, talking back). Parents expect this, expect to be able to  <br/>\ndiscipline or punish (or however they handle it, in nice ways they  <br/>\nredirect, etc) those behaviors. We just view autistic behaviors as so  <br/>\nextreme that we can&#39;t deal with it. Part of that is the medical  <br/>\nestablishment. After all, their bread and butter relies on  <br/>\ndisempowering us and making us NEED them. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s  <br/>\nmalicious any more, the doctors/psychologists that we see were  <br/>\ntrained to believe this in medical/graduate school, by doctors or  <br/>\npsychologists who were trained to believe this in medical/graduate  <br/>\nschool. It&#39;s a closed system, with very little outside view. They  <br/>\nfight change. I was premed, I spent many summers with a mentor in the  <br/>\nhospital. I have doctor friends. They are just people, and after a  <br/>\nfew years of dealing with those people (both as a single student, and  <br/>\nas a mom with seven kids), I came to realize that they don&#39;t know  <br/>\nmuch more. Parenting my quirky children is no different than  <br/>\nparenting my totally  mainstream children. It takes more work, you  <br/>\nhave to be open constantly and totally on them, I call it  <br/>\nsuperparenting, but really again, it&#39;s the same parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can look at our children with open hearts, learn to TRUST  <br/>\nourselves again, we can help our children so much more. They will  <br/>\nlearn. I have kids that prove it. They will learn after whatever  <br/>\nmagical age the doctors told you that their brain is static, I  <br/>\npromise. I was told Bre would never talk because she didn&#39;t speak  <br/>\nbefore three. She started verbalizing at four. I was told she  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t talk if she didn&#39;t make sentences before five. She started  <br/>\nafter that magical date, and now can talk pretty good. I was told she  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t make friends, she has three that come over and visit  <br/>\nregularly (plus her own sisters). She&#39;s not what I would consider a  <br/>\ngood friend for ME....but those girls love and respect who she is.  <br/>\nThey come in and play her way, until they are bored and then they  <br/>\ndrag her to play their way for a while, they continue to play and  <br/>\nignore her stims. THOSE ARE THE FRIENDS I WANT HER TO HAVE, NOT THE  <br/>\nONES I HAVE TO CHANGE HER FOR THEM TO LIKE. I was told she&#39;d never be  <br/>\nself sufficient, yet at eleven, she can make scrambled eggs, cook hot  <br/>\ndogs, make mac-n-cheese, steam just about any veggie, and make home  <br/>\nmade baked goods. I could go on and on... I have dozens of examples  <br/>\nthat prove you should never trust a professional who barely knows  <br/>\nyour child, just knows a summation of disorder tendencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel and Avari<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jun 9, 2008, at 5:51 AM, Joyce Fetteroll wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Everyone is that way to some extent.

It isn&#39;t fair to to the child or to others to not  <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat &quot;not conforming to expectations&quot; means is that we don&#39;t have to  <br/>\nmake a 4 yo sit in a chair because society expects preschoolers to be  <br/>\nable to do it. We don&#39;t have to force socialization on a 3 yo so they  <br/>\nlearn to &quot;play nice&quot;. (We can keep them from situations they don&#39;t  <br/>\nneed and wait for maturity to help.)

Those kids (like their parents) run the gamet.  Most are<br/>\nunschoolers.  They&#39;re the most accepting group of kids I&#39;ve even<br/>\nknown.  Yet, even they were having a hard time coping with his behavior.<br/>\nThey had begun to turn away from him.  My own son had asked me, &quot;Why does he<br/>\nsay those things?&quot;  Now, my son and the others are saying, &quot;Oh, now I<br/>\nunderstand.&quot;   My goodness, if a group of unschooled teens are having a hard<br/>\ntime with this child socially, what&#39;s going to happen to him out in the<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; world?  I think having something to pin the behavior on (blame the<br/>\nbehavior on?) in this case is a positive thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not an expert on Asperger&#39;s by any means, but from what I&#39;ve read, the<br/>\nchildren who exhibit these &quot;social differences&quot; often can&#39;t read the<br/>\nreactions of others or don&#39;t understand why others react the way they do.<br/>\nThat would make it hard for them to ask for assistance.  They know<br/>\nsomething&#39;s not quite right, but don&#39;t understand what it is or why.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to his mom, she&#39;s a single mom who works very hard.  His father is not<br/>\nvery involved in his life.  His mom is a college instructor who teaches at<br/>\nthree different colleges in order to make enough money for them to<br/>\nlive.  She is very grateful to have the therapy available and her son is<br/>\nexcited to get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my own son with SID, our research at the time indicated that OT would<br/>\nbe most effective before the age of 10.  At 10, the brain&#39;s sensory<br/>\nperception connections become hardwired, and therapy doesn&#39;t do much good.<br/>\nI haven&#39;t looked at the state of the research lately, so I don&#39;t know if<br/>\nthat&#39;s still the conventional wisdom.  But when my son was 5, and was<br/>\ncowering on the floor in the corner of his classroom, he didn&#39;t know what<br/>\nwas wrong and neither did we.  I wasn&#39;t willing to wait to find out if<br/>\nmaturity would take care of it or if he would learn to cope.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never made a big deal out of it.  He went to OT twice a week to play with<br/>\nMiss Cindi.  We never told anyone except my MIL about the diagnosis.  Until<br/>\nhe was long out of OT, we never even told Zack why he went.  He didn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto feel different and we didn&#39;t want him to feel that he was different from<br/>\nother kids.  Sometime ago, the topic came up in conversation about a friend<br/>\nof his, and he asked us what SID was.  I told him that&#39;s why he went to play<br/>\nwith Miss Cindi when he was little.  That was the last of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarron<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 6/8/08, Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ~~***but many of us (most of whom would be labeled &quot;normal&quot;) would<br/>\n&gt; benefit from some type of intervention ***~~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I disagree.<br/>\n&gt; I think most of the &quot;therapy&quot; and &quot;milestones&quot; are all about making a<br/>\n&gt; person fit into mainstream.

He<br/>\nregularly says inappropriate things. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy social skills are lacking.  Partly because I don&#39;t enjoy socializing.  I haven&#39;t had the patience or inclination to develop nice social skills.   I don&#39;t like small talk and if I&#39;m with folks and someone&#39;s going on about the terrible calamity of a broken fingernail I&#39;m the most likely person to compare that catastrophe to, say, the recent earthquake in China.  Yes, I&#39;m one of those annoying people. &lt;g&gt;  Lots of people would find my behavior inappropriate. &lt;g&gt;  Put me in the woods and I can tell you (usually) what tree is what, what a shrub or wild flower is called, what bird is singing in the beyond, what that spider crawling up your leg is.   I know the name of every dog and most of the cats in our neighborhood but can&#39;t remember the names of their people.   I might forget to offer you a cup of coffee if you come through my door but your dog would get a cookie and a belly rub. &lt;g&gt;  I can get a deer off a barbed wire fence and set a broken bird&#39;s wing and sew up a wound with dental floss, but I can&#39;t chat you up about your new hair do.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n(one benefit of that is I&#39;m rarely asked to the long fingernail parties, and often hired to dog sit.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n*** As a result of the evaluation, the professionals have<br/>\nrecommended a course of treatment or training, really.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSince there&#39;s a way to help him learn better social skills his mom could have helped him.   When Dylan was going to a new friend&#39;s house for the first time, depending how little he was I&#39;d either call that mom and see what she expected and pass that information on to Dylan or I&#39;d remind him he could ask (&quot;Should I take off my shoes?&quot;   &quot;Is it ok to take this juice into the living room?&quot; etc.,)  I still do that if I know something about the place we&#39;re going to that he doesn&#39;t know.  He would do the same for me.   He&#39;s known for years in any new situation to watch what the adults do, or the parents of his friends to get a clue about what he should do.   That wasn&#39;t something he automatically knew, it came about because he had information and then experience. <br/>\n<br/>\n***to help him learn the social skills that don&#39;t come naturally to<br/>\nhim.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think all kinds of social skills come naturally to everyone.   I wouldn&#39;t know what to do at a White House dinner.  There&#39;d be someone to coach me, I&#39;m sure, but it wouldn&#39;t come naturally to me.  I wouldn&#39;t know what to do at a fancy Moroccan restaurant the first time I visited.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***but many of us (most of whom would be labeled &quot;normal&quot;) would benefit from some<br/>\ntype of intervention ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYour neighbors might like to correct your misguided homeschooling ideas.  My mother would have liked to fix my freaky vegan ideas.   I think there were a few folks would have stopped me from having my kid at home if they could have.   I don&#39;t personally see the benefit to that kind of intervention. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to think about what we feel we have the right to do to other people, especially if those people are our kids who are relatively powerless compared to us.     <br/>\n<br/>\n***He had years of occupational<br/>\ntherapy. He reached all the milestones his OTs set for him.***<br/>\n<br/>\n I didn&#39;t need a diagnosis when Dylan couldn&#39;t stand the feel of seams in his clothing I just needed to help Dylan not have to feel those seams.   I didn&#39;t need a diagnosis when Dylan couldn&#39;t stand the texture of mashed potatoes or pudding or bananas I just needed to remember not to give him those things.  I didn&#39;t need a diagnosis when his play was pacing back and forth in the same spot, holding onto his long hair and shaking it in his hands while he created a story in his head, I just needed to remind my husband the grass would eventually grow back.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nNo one set milestones for him and yet here he is at sixteen, wearing his clothes right side out, avoiding foods he doesn&#39;t like, writing stories down without pacing or holding his hair. &lt;g&gt;   He was not then and is not now dysfunctional or disordered.  He was a kid different from his parents and his friends and he was and is absolutely normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Maybe I&#39;m naive, but I don&#39;t see a diagnosis and &quot;label&quot; of autism as much<br/>\ndifferent from that of cancer or heart disease or despression. ***<br/>\n<br/>\n Parents aren&#39;t equipped to treat life threatening illness.  We don&#39;t have access to drugs or medical equipment without an expert and most of us don&#39;t have a place to perform surgery. Cancer and heart disease aren&#39;t a normal state of being for most people or for most kids. If a person has cancer we don&#39;t say &quot;Bob *is* cancer&quot; or Chuck *is* heart disease,&quot;  the way we say &quot;Sam is ADHD.&quot;      <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re talking about behaviors we can help our kids learn those that will make life easier and avoid those that might trouble them or others because behavior is common to every human.  We all have behaviors.  We have experience in our society that our kids don&#39;t yet have.  We have information to share. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf a diagnosis just helped parents make life better for kids then that&#39;d be cool.  But we should be cautious for some very obvious reasons.  Experts don&#39;t get paid unless they convince us we need their services.  Experts have a narrow definition of normal.   Experts we&#39;d take our kids to have based most of their opinion on schooled kids and schooled kids have altered psychology and stress that unschooled kids don&#39;t have.  Experts refuse to see the stress schooled kids (or any kids) are under as a factor in their behavior.  Experts don&#39;t suggest the problem might be the parents because if they anger parents they lose a client and don&#39;t get paid. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd less obvious, but more important, we don&#39;t get to decide how our kids should be.  It&#39;s our job to meet their needs, not to force or drug or train them to meet our expectations and it seems too many parents don&#39;t understand the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know anything about autism and have had experience with only one child who&#39;s parents said was &quot;on the spectrum.&quot;   She stayed with us for  few days when her mom had surgery.  Her mom said she had behaviors she could not control but I didn&#39;t see any odd behaviors at my house.   She seemed a normal kid to me and I wonder how many people in her life will treat her like there&#39;s something wrong with her because her mom makes sure everyone knows she has a diagnosis.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a list called &quot;shinewithunschooling&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a>  that helps parents celebrate kids for who they are.
