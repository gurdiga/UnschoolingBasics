We have only been back a week from picking up our daughter in India.  Although our travel was challenging at times, we stuck together as a family unit and learned how to navigate life in another country.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEverything was going well until we got home.  Our son of 8 yrs, started getting very upset and jealous of the new sister he always wanted.  He is challenging us in every way, but is coming around quickly.  She is very sensitive to his needs, which makes their relationship grow closer.  With each new family member, there is are new relationships to be defined!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I am trying to say is that I am glad our son is part of this new journey of building family relationships and dynamics.  If he can start to feel good about our time together and individually apart, he doesn&#39;t feel out of the loop.  Instead, he feels the positive aspects of being a big brother and learning to work through challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has helped is his space (or running away to grandma&#39;s house next door) to process the new changes.  Also, individual time with each parent, as well as together as a family has really helped.  We are all learning about each other and redefining our roles in the family.  This cannot be done if either one is in an institutional setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter the school, kids are bullied.  How young do you want your son to learn this?  Your sensitivity will guide you.  If you need the space to rest before birth and after, by all means take it.  Just be mindful that your child always knows your love and guidance will never pass, despite the testing they will exhibit with the changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are learning to Just work through our new family by living in the moment!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!  Trust your judgement.  But the quicker you adjust as a family unit, the quicker bonding and free learning can happen naturally!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaya</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: what can I healthily protect my child from?","postDate":"1268590484","msgId":43346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYxMTM1MS42NzY5NS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhuajdncitkaG45QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhuajdncitkaG45QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43345,"nextInTopic":43350,"prevInTime":43345,"nextInTime":43347,"topicId":43329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you ve ever read the books of Narnia, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader starts with a huge bullying scene at a school alaSummerhill.

An adult-to student ratio that&#39;s closer to a home environment helps, but it doesn&#39;t address the biggest problem, which is that the kids can&#39;t choose, five minutes into the day or five minutes from the end of the day, to leave. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;we figured we&#39;d utilize the school during his &quot;preschool years&quot; and then once the baby is a bit older and we have more flexibility move to a more to a traditional ...

One of the challenges of unschooling is figuring out how to think out of the box - its something that takes a bit of practice! And one way to learn to think out of the box is to take the &quot;box&quot; answer - school - and decide its not an option. So if school&#39;s not an option, how do you get your needs met? One of the marvelous gifts of Ray coming to live with us at 13 was that him going back to school wasn&#39;t a good option. Before then, I&#39;d had school in the back of my mind as an option for my dd and I didn&#39;t realize that it was a wall around my thinking. It didn&#39;t seem like a wall, it seemed like a safety net!

You are asking for an &quot;unbiased&quot; answer from a biased population. Early school and daycare has been argued to lead to more precocious children. If a more precocial child is among your parenting goals than school may be among the tools that you use to achieve that. Early school and daycare have been argued to lead to more aggressive children. Given the concerns of your earlier post, a more aggressive child amongst more aggressive children is probably not among your goals. That&#39;s from an NICHD study of early childcare based on rating by their caregivers. Oh, David&#39;s reading from the study: &quot;When children are in daycare for more hours mothers were less sensitive in their interactions with their children at 6, 15, 24, and 36 months. Children were less positively engaged with their mothers; were at heightened risk of insecure infant-mother attachment; showed<br/>\n more problem behaviors; and lower social competence.&quot; Longitudinally, at 54 months of age, the children were found to be much the same. David wants me to add &quot;If the infant and mother are separated the maternal hormonal profile will be totally different than if they are together. <br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are naturally given to others to tend to them. It is natural. It has been going on for a long, long time. Wet-nursing is a common event, killed off lots of French children in the 1700&#39;s as their mothers chose to send them off so that they could continue to work in their home. Sarah Hrdy has a fantastically interesting book that touches on that. Apparently there were public service posters pushing for mothers to breastfeed their own children the child mortality risk was so high. In 1800 BC Hammurabi&#39;s code made reference to wet-nurses. Long time, long history, very natural to look to others for caring for a child. Particularly if you have the money or goods to support someone else coming into your family, your home to do so. Oh, oh, the Tuareg are a nomadic group of people who captured people from other groups and enslaved them. Among the slave responsibilities was childcare. Fascinatingly enough the slaves children thrived while the Tuareg<br/>\n children didn&#39;t do so well. Care by a non-related individual wasn&#39;t as good as care by your parent. But it wasn&#39;t unnatural, just less caring. And, for some reason, it reminds me of the television show I&#39;ll Fly Away with the housekeeper who also provides some childcare being torn between her own family and her employer&#39;s family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do, whichever &quot;natural&quot; route you follow, preschool or keeping your child with you, will be about your priorities and the outcomes you are looking for. It will be about you balancing your work with your children&#39;s care. The stuff people have been doing since long before they were people. An unschooling list isn&#39;t going to help you to figure out how to fit school into the mix. But it will help you to fit unschooling in with the work or how to care for two children while unschooling or a lot of other ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: aimeemwheeler &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:apmama@...\">apmama@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 13 March, 2010 23:25:35<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: what can I healthily protect my child from?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone!

Yes, your son will learn now to play well with<br/>\nothers, to negotiate, to be as social as he wants to be - especially if he<br/>\nhas a sibling.  I don&#39;t think mean preschoolers on the playground is a<br/>\nnatural part of growing up that we as parents just have to accept while we<br/>\nprovide salve for our childrens&#39; wounded souls.  I think it&#39;s a perfectly<br/>\nokay approach to avoid the injury in the first place and to work with our<br/>\nkids on their interpersonal and problem solving skills as they get older<br/>\nand more capable of managing relationships.  My son is 3 right now and if<br/>\nsome kid was mean to him it would be hurtful, not a learning experience<br/>\nand not growth producing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven&#39;t had your son in school then send him when the baby arrives,<br/>\nit could send him a very wrong message.  I do agree with that.

Even Summerhill, the original free school had this problem. If you send your child to an institutional setting he will be bullied and may actually bully others. This is taking bullying in its widest term and includes coercion to be part of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I think this happens, even in &#39;free&#39; schools is because not all kids bring the same free home experiences to the school. One cannot dictate what a family does at home. Surprisingly coercive families do send their kids to free schools, don&#39;t ask me why. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso logically a school has to have some rules and is rarely truly &#39;free&#39;. For example my eldest once set off on a walk, aged 2 and a half. Obviously I followed (baby in a sling, where she normally resided). My child never once looked back, we were in a huge country park, so roads were not an issue, nor were wild animals (we don&#39;t live in the US, I know your parks may have bears etc) She just kept going. Baby and I just kept following. Eventually she sat down, looked around, saw me and smiled. We rested a while and then slowly made our way back. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a normal little incident in a day, yet how can this happen in an institutional setting? <br/>\n<br/>\nObviously what to do when baby arrives is your choice, but do not delude yourself that any school, not matter how &#39;free&#39; can be free of bullying and coercion.<br/>\n<br/>\nkatie.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":346799235,"authorName":"aimeemwheeler","from":"&quot;aimeemwheeler&quot; &lt;apmama@...&gt;","profile":"aimeemwheeler","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"what can I healthily protect my child from?","postDate":"1268495535","msgId":43329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhuZ2NiZit0ajJvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43330,"prevInTime":43328,"nextInTime":43330,"topicId":43329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all.
