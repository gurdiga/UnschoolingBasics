Little things you can offer to lighten his day? We got a  heater for  <br/>\nour house and having a warm corner to snuggle into is really nice.  Dinner out? <br/>\nDinner in? A trip to a motel in a nearby town with a heated  pool and a chance <br/>\njust to get away from everything for a few minutes  early in January? A day out <br/>\non his own?

So nagging worries about his own place in the world are likely sending him to worry about other things as well. Its pretty normal. When things are slow or stressful at work, the working partner often brings the stress home in other ways. I know its something I have to watch out for, and maybe you&#39;ve noticed it with your own work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think hubby is bored with being home with the kids. He&#39;s annoyed at being a short order cook for meals on demand. He doesn&#39;t like the all-nighters the kids pull when they are into a game or show. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of that is normal, getting used to being a full time parent. Its not what any of us, moms or dads, are raised to expect any more. Plenty of moms come to unschooling lists saying &quot;I&#39;m bored and annoyed and not getting enough sleep&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to some extent this is part of what I said above. He&#39;s he Dad... what&#39;s he doing being the Mom? I&#39;m not saying he &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; - I&#39;m the working parent and my partner his home with the kids. At the same time, though, George didn&#39;t grow up expecting to be a full time dad and he struggles with the details sometimes - and *he&#39;s* 100% on board wtih unschooling. A dad who isn&#39;t &quot;sold&quot; on unschooling still, and working through issues about his place in the universe as a man and father? It&#39;s really understandable that he&#39;d be looking to exert more control over the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband came to this list or an unschooling dads list, he&#39;d get lots of advice on how to shift his attitude and be a more supportive partner for you and his kids - but He&#39;s not asking. If he&#39;s not sure he *wants* to be a better partner, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother issue. No-one should feel like they &quot;have to&quot; unschool. Its a lifestyle that takes a certain amount of wholeheartedness to pull off successfully. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; We started unschooling when I was home full time. I had a chance to work through my fears and doubts. Hubby may need to do that now. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re right about that - but be aware he may come to a different set of conclusions than you did. He may even need to try homeschooling for a time. Its normal for new homeschoolers to try different methods - if he hasn&#39;t gone through that part of the process of learning about home-ed, its a gap he&#39;s likely seeking to fill. Like kids, adults often learn by experimentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Please tell me of one unschooled child who has grown up to be angry at his parents for their choice to unschool.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so in this story is the difference between unschooling and unparenting, but I have one. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I ever heard the word &quot;unschool&quot; was from a 13yo girl complaining that she couldn&#39;t read because her stupid parents thought unschooling was a good idea. She had recently demanded to be put in school, along with her younger brother and was taking remedial classes - and utterly furious with her parents over their neglect. Now, I can say &quot;that&#39;s unparenting not unschooling&quot; but the fact is this family had called whatever they were doing unschooling for years and it blew up in their faces. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why lists like this are valuable to some - they are places where people can learn that unschooling requires more than &quot;run, be free!&quot; Her parents thought &quot;run, be free!&quot; was enough... woops. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids aren&#39;t getting a lot of support and engagment, then full blown unschooling may not be the best options for them. It might be better to do something more like eclectic homeschooling - especially if it helps dad have a better relationship with his kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Please tell me about a miserable illiterate under-employed or unemployed hermit who was unschooled as a child<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nBut! even that girl I mentioned above learned the skills she needed to live in the world and work and be independent. I&#39;ve yet to meet an unschooler who fits the above description - and I think its because, if nothing else unschooled and homeschooled kids know they have another option. They can throw themselves on the mercy of the system and get help. Its one of the reasons homeschoolers get a bad rap by educators - they do, after all, see the &quot;failures&quot; of home-education, including unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut those kids are still better off than those who are in the system from the start and still end up lacking a ton of basic skills.

She doesn&#39;t want to &quot;fall behind&quot;.  She has big visions for her future and believes school is the best pathway.  Okay.  We are going to figure it out for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is taking leadership to call the school and figure out next steps. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also told me that he thinks we are doing a disservice to our kids, especially our 9 year old son, by unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is worried that our son, who hates reading and never writes, will grow up illiterate. He also worries that he will be anti-social. Our son has friends on line but none in person. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he thinks our son will be angry at us once he grows up for limiting his options as a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me of one unschooled child who has grown up to be angry at his parents for their choice to unschool.  Please tell me about a miserable illiterate under-employed or unemployed hermit who was unschooled as a child, maybe even lives with his parents because he can&#39;t successfully complete a job application. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I sound sarcastic here. <br/>\n<br/>\nHubby told me that he has been lying about his belief in unschooling.
