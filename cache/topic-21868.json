From my <br/>\nperspective, I want my kids to have the skills to problem solve and <br/>\nthink critically *and* understand how to work through difficult <br/>\nemotions. Saying &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; doesn&#39;t do any <br/>\nof that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you switched to &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s just not possible&quot;? That <br/>\nat least has the benefit of acknowledging the feelings involved. Of <br/>\ncourse, it *does* set you up to answer the question &quot;why isn&#39;t it <br/>\npossible?&quot; That&#39;s the sticker. If you don&#39;t have the quick-and-dirty <br/>\nbrush-offs like &quot;I&#39;m the mom, that&#39;s why&quot; and &quot;you can&#39;t always get <br/>\nwhat you want&quot; you have to really think about and answer your kids <br/>\nquestions, and entertain some alternative solutions. Maybe even <br/>\nchange your position - not a bad thing at all! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He will learn to be spoiled if he gets everytihng<br/>\n&gt; he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t noticed my 5yo being any more rude or demanding than other <br/>\nkids her age. She does try to find solutions and consider <br/>\nalternatives, which is sometimes inconvenient to *me*! But its <br/>\ncertainly better than what I see her non-unschooled kid friends <br/>\ndoing, which is to sneak around behind their parents&#39; backs to <br/>\nexplore the same kinds of alternatives. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson, before he moved in with us, was a fairly &quot;typical&quot; surly <br/>\nteen - that&#39;s the other dividend you get for &quot;can&#39;t always get what <br/>\nyou want&quot;, a teen who reflects that attitude back atcha. Last night <br/>\nRay was telling me some of the things he&#39;s done to &quot;teach his mom <br/>\nshe can&#39;t always get her way anymore&quot; - Yikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our house, he&#39;s a sweetheart. Yesterday was his first day up from <br/>\nbeing sick and he was falling over himself to be helpful. We&#39;ve <br/>\nnever told him &quot;you can&#39;t always get what you want&quot; - we&#39;ve <br/>\nsaid &quot;lets see if that&#39;s possible&quot; and tried to make it happen. Not <br/>\nalways successfully, but he&#39;s seen us bend over backwards to help <br/>\nhim get what he wants, and he&#39;s grateful. He doesn&#39;t *say* that, but <br/>\nit shows in the ways he&#39;s helpful and friendly and courteous. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If I left him to do what<br/>\n&gt; he wanted, he would eat junk food and play video games all day <br/>\n&gt;long...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That *is* the way people react when limitations are lifted. My <br/>\nstepson has spent the last...oh, six weeks, I guess, staying up all <br/>\nnight to play Runescape. He&#39;s decided to switch back to being awake <br/>\nin the daytime, though, even though he knows it means less computer <br/>\ntime - one computer/phone line, four users. Natural limits. He <br/>\nmisses doing other things, though. Different limits. He&#39;s learning <br/>\nto negotiate his *own* wants and needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s gone a similar route with food - he started out eating all the <br/>\nchips, cookies and soda he could get his hands on, and we <br/>\nfacilitated that as much as we could afford. He&#39;s been eating less <br/>\nand less, and yesterday announced he didn&#39;t want any soda for <br/>\nawhile, would we please not buy any? No pressure from us. He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike the way it makes him feel. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the midst of my trying to get this posted, my neighbor&#39;s dh <br/>\nstopped by to say she&#39;s sick and can&#39;t hang with Mo today while Ray <br/>\nand I go to the skatepark. I explained to her that this is really <br/>\nreally important to Ray, and how could we make it possible for her? <br/>\nShe came up with some ideas and loaded up the car. She can&#39;t get <br/>\nwhat she wants today, but she&#39;s thoughtful and creative and willing <br/>\nto work to make the situation possible for All of us.

It doesn&#39;t have to be taught through money <br/>\ncontrols.  On a simple level, not having what they want has been learned <br/>\nthrough loosing a ball game.

A wise woman once said to me - if you can afford <br/>\nit why would you withhold it from your child?  Do you withhold purchasing <br/>\nsomething you want (even if it&#39;s not necessary) just because it&#39;s something <br/>\nyou like - a new pair of shoes, a handbag, piece of jewelry, a cd, another <br/>\nsketch pad or journal, a cookie?  There have been times in my family&#39;s life <br/>\nwhen we didn&#39;t have much money to spend on these things - and each purchase <br/>\nhad to be thought out very carefully against our budget.  I feel very <br/>\nblessed that today i don&#39;t have to be as concerned - and want to pass that <br/>\nblessing along to my kids.  It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t discuss the cost and <br/>\nthe possibility of putting money towards something other than what they&#39;ve <br/>\nexpressed interest in (like going to an unschooling conference&lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were very small and didn&#39;t yet understand limits to spending - <br/>\ni avoided stores with them.  And if that was not possible - i would budget a <br/>\nfew dollars into the shopping list so that they could pick out whatever they <br/>\nwanted beyond the necessities - they knew they had this going into the store <br/>\nand pretty much always worked within the budget.  They were also involved in <br/>\npicking out what the necessities were.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;He will learn to be spoiled if he gets everytihng<br/>\n&gt;he wants. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This time it was a very wise man who said to me, &quot;something spoils only when <br/>\nit is left on the shelf by itself to rot.&quot;  I think we can only &#39;spoil&#39; a <br/>\nperson by withholding from them not by giving them what they ask for - want <br/>\nor need.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My son is a sensitive child too..

My dd&#39;s <br/>\nhave complete control over anything they want to eat and they always end up <br/>\nasking for &#39;good&#39; food when they need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce my younger dd missed having ice cream after an evening out becaue she <br/>\nfell asleep on the ride home.  she was anxious about getting into the car <br/>\nbecause she knew this might happen.  I promised her that if she fell asleep <br/>\nshe could have ice cream for breakfast, in fact, i said to her, she could <br/>\nhave icecream for breakfast, lunch and dinner and snack in between if she <br/>\nwished.  She could eat icecream all day long.  The next day - she did have <br/>\nice cream for breakfast and lunch.  But by mid day she came to me saying she <br/>\nneeded some &#39;real&#39; food in her body.  She was about 6 at the time.  She <br/>\nloves telling this story (so do i infact) - and since that day (3.5 years <br/>\nago) she asked if she could do that again only once.  I said of course.  But <br/>\nshe has yet to take me up on the offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t speak personally about video games with my own kids - but i do have <br/>\na friend with a teen son who realized his lightheadedness and naseau came <br/>\nfrom not taking enough breaks from his machines to eat and rest.

The truth is unless there is a <br/>\nvery real reason that is beyond my control for the &#39;no&#39; - i hear the <br/>\narbitrary nature of my &#39;no&#39; and then ask myself what&#39;s really important <br/>\nhere?  What is important is that i can be flexible.  How can i expect or <br/>\nwant them to exhibit the value of flexibility if i can not be flexible?  <br/>\nThat i can discuss with my kids ways to get to yes.  That they feel <br/>\nempowered and a sense of control over their own life.  I have no problem <br/>\nletting my kids know i can change my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;No&#39; is an important word.  My very wise husband said (i surround myself by <br/>\nwise people &lt;g&gt;), unless you can say &#39;no&#39; there is no real &#39;yes.&#39;  BUT - <br/>\nsaying no simply for the sake of being able to say no is punitive and <br/>\ndisempowering.  Sometimes if i feel the urge to say no i wait a few seconds <br/>\nbefore responding.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs important as it is for you to be able to say no - it is important for my <br/>\nkids to be able to say no to me as well.  &quot;No - mom that is not ok with me <br/>\nthat i can not do that - or have that - or whatever.  This is important to <br/>\nme&quot; they will tell me.

My son (who <br/>\njust turned 5), was so easy going and laid back until about 3 years of age, and after a new <br/>\nsibling, that we started reading all the positive parenting books, which are really still very <br/>\ncontrolling and &quot;discipline&quot; oriented.  Soon after we discovered radical unschooling by way <br/>\nof the Always Unschooled group and then this one, and WOW!!  It was like a bunch of light <br/>\nbulbs went off.  You mean  you treat your children the way you want to be treated?  You <br/>\nput your trust in them to make decisions regarding themselves and these amazing beings <br/>\ncan actually know what it is they need and what they have a passion for?  In a way it is so <br/>\nmuch more complex then traditional parenting and using bribes/rewards/punishments, <br/>\nbut in the same sense it is so simple.  I&#39;m not saying we have zero conflicts in our home, <br/>\nbut for the most part they are easy to handle by just talking with our children and coming <br/>\nup with solution that meet everyones needs.  We basically don&#39;t have limits on anything in <br/>\nour home, and everything (minus somebody getting hurt or property being damaged) is <br/>\nnegotiable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son self-regulates himself on just about everything (t.v., video games, food, hygiene, <br/>\nect..) and does an amazing job IMO.  As an unschooling parent we are here to help our <br/>\nchildren attain whatever it is they desire, and act as facilitators to their learning and life in <br/>\ngeneral.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m definiately not an expert or veteran in radical unschooling, I just know what this type <br/>\nof lifestyle has done for our family and can&#39;t be gracious enough that we discovered it <br/>\nwhen we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust keep reading all you can and ask any question you haveo on this list and it will get <br/>\nanswered, probably much more eloquent than my answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;shellinispencer&quot; &lt;shellini@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Julie, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I guess I am learning then.. lol..

Early on in my unschooling <br/>\n&gt; journey, I found that some of what I considered priciples were in <br/>\n&gt; conflict with one another and I had to do some deeper &quot;work&quot; to find <br/>\n&gt; the core values or priciples that I wanted to embody in my life. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In the example above, I&#39;d guess that there&#39;s a principle of <br/>\n&gt; moderation, but I&#39;d suggest digging deeper. Why is moderation <br/>\n&gt; important? What&#39;s underneath that? Why is getting all wrapped up in <br/>\n&gt; something fun, especially, such a problem? Would it be as much of a <br/>\n&gt; problem if it were something &quot;educational&quot;, like reading? I suspect <br/>\n&gt; there are some fears here that need to be examined. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the problems with moderation, from an unschooling <br/>\n&gt; perspective, is that people learn most easily from their passions, <br/>\n&gt; and certainly most joyfully. People of all ages will take on amazing <br/>\n&gt; challenges when they are inspired. My stepson will do the very <br/>\n&gt; things playing video games or skateboarding that he flat-out refused <br/>\n&gt; to do in school: he will do dull, repetitive exercises for the <br/>\n&gt; purpose of &quot;getting better&quot; at a particular skill. He actually <br/>\n&gt; *chooses* to do something he doesn&#39;t really like bc it forwards his <br/>\n&gt; passions. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":292658207,"authorName":"shellinispencer","from":"&quot;shellinispencer&quot; &lt;shellini@...&gt;","profile":"shellinispencer","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Snappy Comebacks For Comments About Controlling Children","postDate":"1173143454","msgId":21911,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVzaWYydSt1ajdhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVzaG5kZSsxNTRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21906,"nextInTopic":21912,"prevInTime":21910,"nextInTime":21912,"topicId":21868,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Julie, I guess I am learning then.. lol..

John Holt wrote something about it in <br/>\n&gt; one of his books (I can&#39;t remember which).  Every person has their <br/>\n&gt; understanding of how life is.  It is their story  of the way things <br/>\n&gt; are -- some would call it their world view.  Anytime a new idea is <br/>\n&gt; introduced, that person has to fit it in to their story.  If the new <br/>\n&gt; idea doesn&#39;t make sense to their story, two things can happen.  <br/>\n&gt; Their story must change.  Or the idea must be rejected or <br/>\n&gt; discounted.  When you introduce a concept as novel as peaceful <br/>\n&gt; parenting, many people will find a way to reject it.  Otherwise it <br/>\n&gt; will rock the foundation of their whole understanding of how the <br/>\n&gt; world works.  I know that&#39;s what happened to me.  My story was <br/>\n&gt; profoundly changed by this concept -- although change was slow.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am willing to talk about unschooling with someone who shows an <br/>\n&gt; interest.  But I don&#39;t bring it up.  Some people get angry or don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; want to hear about it.  And no wonder, you are threatening <br/>\n&gt; everything they hold to be true.  My mil HAS to believe that the way <br/>\n&gt; she raised her children was the right and best way.  It is <br/>\n&gt; fundamental to who she is.  She doesn&#39;t like to talk much about how <br/>\n&gt; things have changed around our house.  Life changing ideas make her <br/>\n&gt; nervous.  I can&#39;t change her.  But she just might be moved by my <br/>\n&gt; children as they grow up.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is wonderful to live peacefully and generously with children.

Would it be as much of a <br/>\nproblem if it were something &quot;educational&quot;, like reading? I suspect <br/>\nthere are some fears here that need to be examined. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the problems with moderation, from an unschooling <br/>\nperspective, is that people learn most easily from their passions, <br/>\nand certainly most joyfully.

The sister (age 9) of the <br/>\n&gt; &gt; boy was there<br/>\n&gt; &gt; saying how much she wanted a gameboy and the mom said &quot;if we bought you a <br/>\n&gt; &gt; gameboy<br/>\n&gt; &gt; you would never read books&quot;, and then went on to say &quot;it&#39;s hard enough to <br/>\n&gt; &gt; get you to read<br/>\n&gt; &gt; without having a gameboy&quot;.  The girl then said &quot;my mom said that if I read <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a lot I can have<br/>\n&gt; &gt; a gameboy&quot;, and then the mom said &quot;maybe&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -My sister & her husband were watching our 4 year old along with their 3 <br/>\n&gt; &gt; kids.

My son said &quot;well he wants to watch it&quot;, and my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sister said &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because he wants to do something doesn&#39;t mean he gets to do it&quot;.

Damek (our 4 year old), came up a <br/>\n&gt; couple of times<br/>\n&gt; asking for things (can&#39;t remember what now), and the neighbor made the <br/>\n&gt; comment &quot;yea,<br/>\n&gt; our kids were very demanding at that age also, we put a stop to that <br/>\n&gt; quick&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -My son just had his 5th birthday party yesterday and had a couple of <br/>\n&gt; neighbor friends<br/>\n&gt; over, one of the mom&#39;s came to get her son and saw that the boys were all <br/>\n&gt; enamoured<br/>\n&gt; with a couple of new gameboy games my son got.  The sister (age 9) of the <br/>\n&gt; boy was there<br/>\n&gt; saying how much she wanted a gameboy and the mom said &quot;if we bought you a <br/>\n&gt; gameboy<br/>\n&gt; you would never read books&quot;, and then went on to say &quot;it&#39;s hard enough to <br/>\n&gt; get you to read<br/>\n&gt; without having a gameboy&quot;.  The girl then said &quot;my mom said that if I read <br/>\n&gt; a lot I can have<br/>\n&gt; a gameboy&quot;, and then the mom said &quot;maybe&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -My sister & her husband were watching our 4 year old along with their 3 <br/>\n&gt; kids.  We came<br/>\n&gt; to pick him up and the boys were still having fun playing, so we stayed <br/>\n&gt; awhile and talked.<br/>\n&gt; Then my nephew wanted to watch a video, but my sister said it was too late <br/>\n&gt; and it was<br/>\n&gt; getting to be bedtime.  My son said &quot;well he wants to watch it&quot;, and my <br/>\n&gt; sister said &quot;just<br/>\n&gt; because he wants to do something doesn&#39;t mean he gets to do it&quot;.  My son <br/>\n&gt; just kind of<br/>\n&gt; looked dumbfounded, as he doesn&#39;t encounter this attitude from us.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In the first situation I feel like I could have said something as she was <br/>\n&gt; addressing us in<br/>\n&gt; particular.  The second situation was sort of between the girl & the mom, <br/>\n&gt; but I was<br/>\n&gt; included in the conversation as the girl was talking to me.  Would you say <br/>\n&gt; anything or just<br/>\n&gt; keep your mouth shut?  I so want to promote unschooling, but I just don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; think in these<br/>\n&gt; situations with these types of people they would even attempt to &quot;get&quot; <br/>\n&gt; what unschooling is<br/>\n&gt; all about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do others do in these types of situations?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Julie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
