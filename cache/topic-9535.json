At your daughter&#39;s age, I don&#39;t think about stimulating the environment or helping them to learn ABC&#39;s in the future or any of that.  My main goal and objective is to let them be and explore their world.  For many years to come simple things will be more than enough for her to learn what babies and young children learn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has helped me in understanding the world of the young child is reading works by John Holt, I think he coined the term unschooling and definitely has championed its cause.  He helped me understand how children learn and how children fail.  If all you do is read posts from this group then you will be miles ahead as the years pass.  There is also www.unschooling.com and the Sandra Dodd and Living and Learning Conference websites that can provide a plethora of information that will support you in your decision to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust is key to this process.  Trust you and your baby girl and you will not go wrong.  As a matter of fact, you will probably grow tenfold as a result and end up with an even more amazing relationship with your daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch Love<br/>\nTyra<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: cthiax <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, January 22, 2006 2:10 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] advice for preparation?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  As I said in my intro, we&#39;re planning to unschool Sophia from the beginning.<br/>\n  She&#39;s seven months right now, and I&#39;m constantly concerned that her<br/>\n  environment contains enough interesting things, and trying not to worry<br/>\n  about her development and so on (she&#39;s my first).
