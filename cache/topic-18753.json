We live in SC so I am required to teach Math, Science, LA, and Social Studies.  We&#39;ll the law does not specifically tell me what area of Math of Science, etc. or how long or how often.  So I write down most of what they do in a day.  Like for instance if the girls are outside catching bugs......it&#39;s Science.  If we bake cookies it&#39;s Math and Science.  If we take a trip to the Post Office it&#39;s Social Studies.  My girls read a lot and write in their journals regularly so I know Language Arts is covered all the time.  I know for us since we are new to homeschooling and more specifically &quot;unschooling&quot; that it&#39;s a process.  I don&#39;t have it all figured out yet.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\njenjon1964 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:portcharlesb@...\">portcharlesb@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          I have been homeschooling my 6 year old twins for first grade.
