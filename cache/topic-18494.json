It&#39;s a  <br/>\nchallenge started by Chris Baty to produce a 50,000 word novel in  <br/>\njust 30 days, starting November 1 and ending midnight November 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org\">http://www.nanowrimo.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s insane and yes, it&#39;s a lot of fun :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, Kat (15), and I have done it for the past 2 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great part about NaNoWriMo is that when the goal is to produce  <br/>\nwords rather than &quot;good writing&quot; then amazingly creative things flow  <br/>\nout. Well, a lot of junk too! But when you turn off your inner  <br/>\neditor, that little voice that says &quot;No, that&#39;s no good, that won&#39;t  <br/>\nwork,&quot; you free yourself up to be more creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can plan -- think up a basic story outline -- but no writing  <br/>\nuntil Nov 1. (That&#39;s in 2 Wednesdays.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve done it with no plan 2 years in a row and it&#39;s worked out great.  <br/>\nEven had a few hours to spare. ;-) Considering that the novel I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen picking at for the last 20 years hasn&#39;t gotten beyond (it&#39;s  <br/>\nembarrassing to say ;-) 100,000 words of notes, actually finishing  <br/>\nsomething and seeing the ideas flow without being planned was  <br/>\nenlightening to say the least :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n(When you&#39;re done you upload your work to the Nanowrimo word counter  <br/>\nand it automatically counts your words. It&#39;s very generous about what  <br/>\nit considers a word. No one reads it. It&#39;s just shear number of words.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first year we did it we set our goal at 1700 words per day (which  <br/>\nwould be 51,000) but some days the writing doesn&#39;t flow as well and  <br/>\nsome days get very busy (there&#39;s Thanksgiving and preparation in  <br/>\nthere!) so last year we set our daily goal as 2000 which gave us some  <br/>\ngenerous padding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked me last year how much time it takes and I was hesitant  <br/>\nto say because for us it&#39;s a lot. *But* I read Chris Baty&#39;s book and  <br/>\nhe said it takes 1.5 to 2 hours a day on average. *Most* people are  <br/>\ndoing it while holding jobs or going to school so that&#39;s all the time  <br/>\nthey can give it. So the answer to how much time is that it will take  <br/>\nus much time as you give it, basically! If you give it all day, it  <br/>\ntakes all day. If you only have 2 hours, it takes 2 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18492,"nextTopicId":18499}}
