They are NOT classrooms like you would find in schools.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe RE at the church we used to attend in Alabama was run by an unschooler who has 5 unschooled grandchildren.  She would read stories, have crafts for them to do, engage them in play.  She never forced anyone to do anything that they didn&#39;t want to do.  Most children your children&#39;s ages haven&#39;t been in any kind of formal classes anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love the UU church and am glad that I found it.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.  Our church is filled with agnostic, atheist, Hindu, Pagan, &quot;recovering Christian,&quot; Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and &quot;other&quot; believers.  We have white, black, middle and far eastern, Native American, old, young, middle-aged, gay, straight, bi, transgendered, and everything in between working together under one roof and in peace.  It&#39;s a wonderful example for me and my kids, who might not find the same support and acceptance if our odd little family was in a traditional church setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":138862876,"authorName":"Goza&#39;s House","from":"&quot;Goza&#39;s House&quot; &lt;goza@...&gt;","profile":"nevagoza","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about church and schooling...","postDate":"1098137373","msgId":3765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMmQwMWM0YjU2MSRlZGYxYWJiMCRlMjY1MzNkOEBob21lPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNsMTQxdCt2OGMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3763,"nextInTopic":3799,"prevInTime":3764,"nextInTime":3766,"topicId":3760,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Kiersten.
