Finally got over <br/>\nmyself and my excellent academic training enough to stop controlling <br/>\nmy dd&#39;s life. It&#39;s making my sister nuts and recently my mother got <br/>\non the &quot;but she *has* to learn manners and respect her elders&quot; <br/>\nsoapbox. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid my best to question her assumptions based on pop psych and <br/>\nskinnerian child rearing techniques (aka &quot;choices&quot; and &quot;natural <br/>\nconsequences&quot; that are anything but). <br/>\n<br/>\nFelt less well-spoken than I wanted so I lent her Rue&#39;s book and a <br/>\nbook about peer orientation vs. parent orientation (this to <br/>\nilluminate my point that sitting around with a bunch of kids her own <br/>\nage, aka socialization, may not be the very best scenario for dd to <br/>\nbe in for 7-9 hours a day).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, haven&#39;t heard much from her about it since. Doubt she really <br/>\nread the books but she probably figured if it&#39;s in print it might be <br/>\ntrue... she reads People and Us and believes them too. I really do <br/>\nlove her while seeing her idiosyncrasies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real reason for this post is to proclaim the fun family times we <br/>\nhave playing World of Warcraft. We each have a computer and a WoW <br/>\naccount. We play simultaneously; we play alone; we play with <br/>\nrelatives across the country using TeamSpeak and a <br/>\nheadset/microphone; we talk about it a lot; we have hours and hours <br/>\nof fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nDd is 8 and enjoys meeting &quot;friends&quot; online, typing out <br/>\nconversations. She didn&#39;t have interest in writing until WoW! ;-)<br/>\n[funny story, she mis-spelled &quot;country&quot; and it came out with #!*% <br/>\ntype stuff on it. She asked me why. I realized that by spelling it <br/>\nwrong she&#39;d written a curse word that they filtered out. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet it? C*ntry instead of country. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was ROFLOL for sure on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, we&#39;re on Kargath realm as Hekatee, Hrte, Heregoro. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn Greymane realm, we are Fyve, Alic, Smellysox and Nightlight. <br/>\nCheck us out if you&#39;re in either of these realms-we&#39;d love to group <br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the tough love on controlling and schooly-ness. I am <br/>\nso happy to see my dd shine with laughter, love and fun after having <br/>\nher spark almost snuffed out by her teacher in 1st grade. It&#39;s been <br/>\na year of healing that would have been shorter, I&#39;m sure, if I&#39;d <br/>\nbeen more diligent in my deschooling and just let it go!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain thanks<br/>\nMissi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6999,"nextTopicId":7004}}
