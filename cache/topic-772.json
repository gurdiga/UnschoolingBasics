KWIM?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI just want to reiterate my original question here was about socializ-ING,<br/>\nas in being with people in social situations, not the much broader and<br/>\n&quot;weaponized&quot; (against homeschoolers AND sometimes against schooled children)<br/>\nconcept of Socialization. This is another area where we are choosing a<br/>\nlifestyle of trusting in and honoring our children&#39;s individuality and<br/>\ndevelopment. I probably could have written a whole &quot;buzz words&quot; post just<br/>\nabout that one, but I think others have it covered. I endorse the online<br/>\narticles that were mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reasons for asking the question were, firstly, that I was interested in<br/>\nother folks insights into more of the non-verbal cues that their children<br/>\nwere giving. It&#39;s easy when you have a gregarious child who is always<br/>\nsaying, &quot;Who am I meeting today?&quot; Jayn is sometimes like that, but usually<br/>\nit is harder to get her out of the house, even if she was keen earlier in<br/>\nthe day. She sometimes seems eager to meet up with a friend, then loses<br/>\nenthusiasm once we get there. She definitely does better with one playmate,<br/>\nthan several, except occasionally. As I said, she is clearer about her &quot;not&quot;<br/>\ndesires than her &quot;yes&quot; desires. I have learnt the futility of taking her<br/>\nsomewhere she does not wish to go, in terms of play dates or the park, as<br/>\nshe will rarely engage with anyone, sometimes hurting feelings by being<br/>\naloof, and we always leave quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly I thought it might spark some interesting discussions and thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome meanings from dictionary sources:<br/>\n<br/>\nso·cial·ize    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (ssh-lz)<br/>\nv. so·cial·ized, so·cial·iz·ing, so·cial·iz·es <br/>\nv. tr.<br/>\n1. To place under government or group ownership or control. [public school?]<br/>\n2. To make fit for companionship with others; make sociable. <br/>\n3.

She has to be watched every second when she is<br/>\nhere, especially since recently she keeps trying to touch Jayn&#39;s private<br/>\nparts, and follows her to the bathroom, and has even tried to take Jayn to<br/>\nthe bathroom with her. She is very sexual it seems to me, her favorite TV<br/>\nshow is clearly a teem program and she talks about boyfriends etc. She tries<br/>\nto get Jayn to take part in secrets with her, that are basically about her<br/>\ntrying to get around the myriad of rules that her mother has - like sneaking<br/>\ncandy. It is very hard since we have no food restrictions of any kind, but<br/>\nthe other girl has a &quot;weight problem&quot; and mucho restrictions, according to<br/>\nher mother.
