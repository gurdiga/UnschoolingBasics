Morgan is amazing at multi-tasking while watching tv, but when she&#39;s watching something new she usually focuses pretty intently. When kids aren&#39;t used to having lots of tv access, then a whole lot of things are new - and if they&#39;re not sure how long all this wonderful tv access is going to last they may be trying to soak up every last moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that&#39;s something else to look at, too - Are there other things to do in the same room? If your house is pretty tidy, and the tv is separate from &quot;play areas&quot; that will get in the way of kids playing while the tv is on. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do I avoid my kids just wanting to watch tv?","postDate":"1267012325","msgId":43245,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NkRFQ0EwQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":43243,"nextInTopic":43246,"prevInTime":43244,"nextInTime":43246,"topicId":43235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Watch -with- them or go do something else for your own self - that knitting project or that novel or the yoga DVD that s been gathering dust...sitting there","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-871197469\">Watch -with- them or go do something else for your own self - that<br/>\nknitting project or that novel or the yoga DVD that&#39;s been gathering<br/>\ndust...sitting there stewing over them not doing educational looking<br/>\nstuff isn&#39;t going to be helpful.

You don&#39;t have to tell them you&#39;re doing that, just say yes when they ask for tv, and when they ask for &quot;one more&quot; - keep saying yes. Have other things available, fun things, but expect them to watch a lot of tv for awhile. Its natural for people to want thing that have been limited! Its part of what makes something a treat or luxury item - its a limited commodity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t what you wanted to hear, was it? Once kids stop thinking of tv as a luxury item, then other fun things will be more appealing, they&#39;ll be able to choose to do something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, it can help to plan some outings that start early in the day to give you all a bit of a break. It also helps a whole lot for you to learn a little tv etiquette - don&#39;t ask kids to change gears in the middle of a show, wait for the end. Also, it can help to make conversation during a commercial, rather than in the middle of a show. That kind of etiquette will save fighting! No-one likes to be interrupted in the middle of something. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do I avoid my kids just wanting to watch tv?","postDate":"1266965640","msgId":43243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwRDcxRUQ5Q0YzNDQ3Nzg5OTc3RUI1QTk1OUVBQTMzQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsdjlsYitqamxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsdjlsYitqamxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43241,"nextInTopic":43245,"prevInTime":43242,"nextInTime":43244,"topicId":43235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They will self-regulate once watching TV gets old and boring. My older girls 8, 5, & almost 3 requested a TV Free day. Last night, my 5 year old asked if we could start having TV free Tuesdays. I said sure and didn&#39;t think anything about it. When we got up this morning, my almost 3 year old ask me to turn off the TV and turn the radio on instead. Normally, we have the TV on pretty much 24/7. They turn it off or go in other rooms and play. The TV isn&#39;t a big deal to them. Kids need time to adjust when you start removing limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How do I avoid my kids just wanting to watch tv?","postDate":"1266965529","msgId":43239,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1NTQ5Ny4xNTg3Ny5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsdjlsYitqamxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsdjlsYitqamxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43235,"nextInTopic":43241,"prevInTime":43238,"nextInTime":43240,"topicId":43235,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kiddos (6 and 4) are very new to unschooling.
