I like to be able to give <br/>\nrecommendations to other people in our local group.  I&#39;ve got Rue&#39;s <br/>\nbook. <br/>\n<br/>\n  I believe Dayna Martin has a new book out, not sure of the name.  <br/>\nAlso, does Sandra have a new book coming out? (I have her Puddles <br/>\nessays book)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Does anyone else know of any other books out there right now?  <br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter (don&#39;t think I spelled that right) has been <br/>\nworking on a new one too, not sure when it is coming out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know there are these great lists, and lots of blogs too, I&#39;m just <br/>\ntrying to track down the new books as they come out.  Since they are <br/>\nusually publised by small publishers, they&#39;re not something people will <br/>\nfind on the Barnes&Noble website...<br/>\n<br/>\n  thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40455,"nextTopicId":40493}}
