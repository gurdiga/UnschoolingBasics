His &quot;no hugs&quot; policy wasn&#39;t about <br/>\nanything anyone else had done or not done, he just wasn&#39;t interested in hugs, <br/>\nthank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time he expanded his hugging circle. First his dad, then his siblings. <br/>\nOn the day of my grandfather&#39;s funeral, when Patrick was 6 years old, he walked <br/>\nup to my grandmother and silently offered her a hug. Then he hugged my mom as <br/>\nwell. It was almost like he had saved those hugs up all those years for when <br/>\nthey&#39;d REALLY be needed. After that my mom could get a hug whenever she asked, <br/>\nmostly, but she&#39;s been careful not to abuse the priviledge, and always <br/>\nappreciates them because she knows they mean something. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s got friends all over the country now who&#39;d be astonished to know he used <br/>\nto be a nonhugger. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was little I used to joke that I had a permanent imprint of his face <br/>\nin the back of my thigh. :) The harder folks tried to talk to him, the more <br/>\nhe&#39;d withdraw.

I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nlet folks try to pressure him into talking, nor allow them to attempt to <br/>\nshame him for not answering them.

I would never insist my children hug someone they don&#39;t desire to hug.  Hence, my youngest, doesn&#39;t hug any of his grandparents and to be honest with you, I blame the grandparents for causing that situation.   If they would have been more desirable people to be around, then maybe he would like them enough to hug them.  They weren&#39;t.  You reap what you sow and children know.  My son&#39;s grandparents have no one to blame but themselves.  <br/>\nVicki<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!

Something that I did before I found unschooling,<br/>\nbut now rarely do, unless succumbing to strong social pressure).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my 4 yo., as to be expected, sometimes says &quot;please,&quot; sometimes<br/>\nsays &quot;can I have that,&quot; and other times says &quot;give me that.&quot;  I know<br/>\nby watching her 9 yo. sister that gentle social skills are developed<br/>\nover time, but I admit that when I&#39;m not at my best, the social<br/>\npressure and criticism can be too intense for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, today we had our friends over that are very strict about<br/>\n&quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you.&quot;  As I mentioned, they withhold things if<br/>\ntheir child does not ask nicely and use the word &quot;please.&quot;  When my<br/>\n4-yo. asked for the swing without saying &quot;please&quot; the 6 yo. boy looked<br/>\nup at his mother and said to my daughter &quot;you didn&#39;t say please, so<br/>\nyou can&#39;t have it.&quot;  His mother didn&#39;t say anything, just stood<br/>\nquietly.  I scrambled in my head for something to say, but initially<br/>\nkept quiet.  After the second time I just made some lame statement<br/>\nabout how we don&#39;t force our children to say &quot;please,&quot; and that over<br/>\ntime they will learn social skills through our modeling and their own<br/>\ndevelopment.  My daughter realized that there was no other way to get<br/>\nthe swing, so she finally said &quot;please,&quot; but I still feel really<br/>\nbummed about how I handled the whole thing and my feelings about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny input would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarla   Mom to Amy (9yo.) and Lily (4.5 yo.)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31370,"nextTopicId":31396}}
