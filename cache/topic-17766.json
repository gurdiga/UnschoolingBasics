At 12 or so she could do it with  <br/>\nease.

We brought the kids into the world and all the  <br/>\nupkeep is our responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce we accept that, then when we ask for help, we&#39;re asking from a  <br/>\ndifferent mindset. We *are* truly asking, knowing the answer could be  <br/>\nno. We are appreciative of what little help they give us. And when we  <br/>\nask  like that, when we appreciate the fact that they&#39;re interrupting  <br/>\nsomething they find important to them to do something that isn&#39;t fun  <br/>\nfor us, then we become people they *want* to do things for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t expect him to start helping just because you&#39;re asking  <br/>\ndifferently!
