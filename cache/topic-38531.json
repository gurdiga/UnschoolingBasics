(0.07 seconds) ...so of those 122,000 hits there will be some repetition or it leads to pages other than the main page of a blog, website, etc. (key goal for good SEO practices is to get every page in the search engine) but if by putting the word unschooling into the google search does not bear enough information above and beyond the resources I have found from this list alone, then I was suggest different search engines, keeping in mind that generally speaking if google finds the other search engines will pretty much vomit up the same links. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlancing over a website will not actually give you any kind of clear picture of the wealth of information contain within. Developing a good website of any kind takes years. Keeping it fresh and new takes hours per day. The amount of work these ladies have put into their websites is amazing. But if you have only scratched the surface you have missed so much. Comments on blogs or about articles push the authors of the websites to put out even more information, to understand where some of their own words come from knowing what other people have said helps tremendously. And honestly most websites that are meant as a resource have tons of links, articles, etc contributed from multiple authors. That is what makes them more complete. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you are looking for general homeschooling sites then you will need to change your search criteria. Keep in mind in through out and in the back of a number of books about unschooling are other reference links. It takes some time to build up a list of places to go on the web that have good information. But as a parent isn&#39;t it our own responsibility to research these things for our own growth? Asking for assistance is wonderful but a better example for our children is to be proactive about things and going out and doing the research. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t care to spend a lot of time on the computer most days, so being<br/>\nable to find what I am looking for quickly is important to me.&quot; I can understand time being a precious commodity and the desire to find information quickly being important. But as of yet I have not found a quick way to do research other than spending time doing it. And I unfortunately have a lot of research to do daily. That happens with college courses and with two children who love to ask questions that I do not know the answers to.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":71246809,"authorName":"DancinDeeDee@aol.com","from":"DancinDeeDee@...","profile":"deelikeabledee","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Other web resources..???","postDate":"1235835239","msgId":38621,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0OTE5MzQ4OTctMTIzNTgzNTE3Mi1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTEzNDE3MzQxOTItQGJ4ZTEyMTEuYmlzeC5wcm9kLm9uLmJsYWNrYmVycnk+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU3MTQzRDg2LUE5OEEtNEJCNC04QjcyLTNDQjQ2RUNDMzM3RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":38620,"nextInTopic":38625,"prevInTime":38620,"nextInTime":38622,"topicId":38531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Joyce.

How long does it take to write out a potato salad  <br/>\nrecipe? About 2 minutes?<br/>\n<br/>\nI calculated it out. I&#39;ve spent at least 14,000 hours helping  <br/>\nunschoolers. I bet Sandra has spent at least that much too. How many  <br/>\nunschoolers have that much time or want to spend that much time  <br/>\nwriting and compiling? Why should it be surprising that there are  <br/>\nonly two websites with the kind of breadth that ours have? You&#39;re  <br/>\n*seriously* underestimating the time it takes to create something  <br/>\nlike those websites and suggesting lots of people could do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur sites are more akin to an introduction to Italian cooking. Potato  <br/>\nsalad indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; so taking one (or two) persons website(s) as the unschooling bible  <br/>\n&gt; (just a comment-don&#39;t read anything into it) and just going with  <br/>\n&gt; that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m willing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needs to read anything into it. It&#39;s pretty plainly stated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere has *anyone* suggested that either site is complete and full  <br/>\nknowledge of unschooling?

I don&#39;t list everywhere people could  <br/>\nexplore since I trust people know how to use Google. I just offer a  <br/>\nplatform to begin from. Sandra&#39;s is more like an entire train  <br/>\nstation, but they&#39;re both still beginning places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two sites not only save having to explain the basics again and  <br/>\nagain, but they provide an easily accessible taste of unschooling so  <br/>\npeople can decide for themselves whether they want to learn more.  <br/>\nThat used to be difficult. Each new person had to either mine the  <br/>\narchives of a list, wading through months of posts that weren&#39;t  <br/>\ndirected at the questions they had, or ask directly for an  <br/>\nintroduction to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would the suggestion of two sites prevent *you* from exploring  <br/>\nbeyond them? Why are you asking for others to do your work for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above may sound outraged, but those are all legitimate questions.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re skimming the surface and not seeing the logistics of creating  <br/>\na big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Other web resources..???","postDate":"1235831973","msgId":38595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ5NDgzRDgwLUUxRjAtNDBFNC04NDlGLTQzQjhDNUZDQzdBMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY2NjU4ODYyOS0xMjM1ODMwOTg1LWNhcmRodV9kZWNvbWJvYnVsYXRvcl9ibGFja2JlcnJ5LnJpbS5uZXQtNTAwNzU4OTgxLUBieGUxMjExLmJpc3gucHJvZC5vbi5ibGFja2JlcnJ5Pg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":38594,"nextInTopic":38597,"prevInTime":38594,"nextInTime":38596,"topicId":38531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

How long does it take to write out a potato salad  <br/>\nrecipe? About 2 minutes?<br/>\n<br/>\nI calculated it out. I&#39;ve spent at least 14,000 hours helping  <br/>\nunschoolers. I bet Sandra has spent at least that much too. How many  <br/>\nunschoolers have that much time or want to spend that much time  <br/>\nwriting and compiling? Why should it be surprising that there are  <br/>\nonly two websites with the kind of breadth that ours have? You&#39;re  <br/>\n*seriously* underestimating the time it takes to create something  <br/>\nlike those websites and suggesting lots of people could do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur sites are more akin to an introduction to Italian cooking. Potato  <br/>\nsalad indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so taking one (or two) persons website(s) as the unschooling bible  <br/>\n&gt; (just a comment-don&#39;t read anything into it) and just going with  <br/>\n&gt; that isn&#39;t something I&#39;m willing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No one needs to read anything into it. It&#39;s pretty plainly stated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere has *anyone* suggested that either site is complete and full  <br/>\nknowledge of unschooling? I state on my front page that it&#39;s a  <br/>\nbeginning point and then give links to where people can continue to  <br/>\nexplore and ask questions. I don&#39;t list everywhere people could  <br/>\nexplore since I trust people know how to use Google. I just offer a  <br/>\nplatform to begin from. Sandra&#39;s is more like an entire train  <br/>\nstation, but they&#39;re both still beginning places.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two sites not only save having to explain the basics again and  <br/>\nagain, but they provide an easily accessible taste of unschooling so  <br/>\npeople can decide for themselves whether they want to learn more.  <br/>\nThat used to be difficult. Each new person had to either mine the  <br/>\narchives of a list, wading through months of posts that weren&#39;t  <br/>\ndirected at the questions they had, or ask directly for an  <br/>\nintroduction to unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would the suggestion of two sites prevent *you* from exploring  <br/>\nbeyond them? Why are you asking for others to do your work for you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above may sound outraged, but those are all legitimate questions.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re skimming the surface and not seeing the logistics of creating  <br/>\na big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Other web resources..???","postDate":"1235813038","msgId":38588,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxRkEzMkFCLUU3QzUtNEZDMC04RDQ5LUQ2ODY0MzJGREE3NEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDkwMjI3MjMxOXcyNjcxZDNhZm4zMGE2NzcyN2FmYTY2ZGJlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYzNTY0NDczLTEyMzU2NTc2NzUtY2FyZGh1X2RlY29tYm9idWxhdG9yX2JsYWNrYmVycnkucmltLm5ldC0xNjc1Njg2MDA2LUBieGUxMDU2LmJpc3gucHJvZC5vbi5ibGFja2JlcnJ5PiA8NjUxOGE5MzYwOTAyMjYxNTA4dzdmYjYzZjhkbjlhY2NkNDcyZGIxNWJiOTFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw2MjI3MTk0NDMtMTIzNTY5Mzk4Mi1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTQ4ODY3MjA5OC1AYnhlMTIxMS5iaXN4LnByb2Qub24uYmxhY2tiZXJyeT4gPDY1MThhOTM2MDkwMjI3MjMxOXcyNjcxZDNhZm4zMGE2NzcyN2FmYTY2ZGJlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38583,"nextInTopic":38589,"prevInTime":38587,"nextInTime":38589,"topicId":38531,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They all have adult or close-to-adult,  <br/>\nliving, breathing children as examples of how unschooling works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we send folks to Joyce&#39;s and Sandra&#39;s sites, it&#39;s because they  <br/>\nhave pretty much everything one needs to unschool. I&#39;ve recently  <br/>\nenjoyed sending people to the link to Pam&#39;s writings on Sandra&#39;s site.  <br/>\nVery, very good stuff. Here is one especially fine article: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/howto</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI feel fortunate to have the writings of  Kelly Lovejoy, Ren Allen,  <br/>\nRue Cream, Meredith, Schuyler, Diana, Debra and others on this list,  <br/>\nthough. They&#39;ve truly thought long and hard about unschooling and have  <br/>\nlived it and continue to live and learn it. I love to read what they  <br/>\nwrite. They&#39;re &quot;golden,&quot; too. And they are on Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also enjoy Danielle Conger&#39;s Organic Learning site: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.org/\">http://www.organiclearning.org/</a><br/>\n(where there are back issues of &quot;Connections&quot; an online e-zine, which  <br/>\nhas ceased publication, but are available now to everyone).<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest Googling &quot;unschooling&quot; or &quot;radical unschooling&quot;. You&#39;ll find  <br/>\nplenty of ideas and sites that may or may not appeal to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t help people on this list to unschool if you are bent on  <br/>\nsaying the same dismissive thing five or more ways.
