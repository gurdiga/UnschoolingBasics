Can we go pick up all <br/>\nJohnny Depp&#39;s movies? Yes - (as many as we can afford right now/as <br/>\nmany as they have in stock/as many as we can carry/whatever). To <br/>\nthe &#39;unspoken&#39; requests (like sleeping until noon), don&#39;t say <br/>\nanything - find something to do yourself (quietly) and leave it be. <br/>\nTeenagers (and preteens) NEED almost as much sleep as a newborn, <br/>\nthat&#39;s how much growth physically and developmentally is going on. <br/>\nCoupled with a shift in melatonin production, their sleep schedules <br/>\nshift around (thus the ability of college students to pull all-<br/>\nnighters) often leaving them wide awake at 2 am and fast asleep at 2 <br/>\npm. Even *public schools* in many areas acknowldege this and are <br/>\ntrying to work out ways to shift the high school schedules a little <br/>\nlater in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS is only 7 but here&#39;s roughly what a day looks like:<br/>\n<br/>\nI get up, feed the dog, and go to work (arriving at my desk between <br/>\n7:30 and 8:00). DH is sometimes up when I leave, sometimes just <br/>\nwaking. DS is usually asleep still (but not always, this morning he <br/>\nwas up before I left). Typically, DH and DS will play a round of <br/>\ncomputer/video games (currently Age of Empires and StarCraft are <br/>\nbig - network computer gaming - DS has a desktop and an old laptop <br/>\nso he can be closer to wherever DH is with his nice new laptop - for <br/>\ninstance, this morning when I called around 9:30, DH was playing <br/>\nagainst the computer in Age of Empires and DS was running the <br/>\nterrain editor module which is used to design the playing field - <br/>\nyou can add mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, etc). Somewhere <br/>\nbetween 9 and 10 roughly, they&#39;ll eat something. DS will head off to <br/>\nwatch TV or play while DH handles a household task (dishes, start <br/>\nsome laundry, whatever). Then they&#39;ll probably play some more - this <br/>\ntime maybe 007 Nightfire on the PS2. Additional household stuff <br/>\nmight happen - more loads of laundry if it&#39;s laundry day (DH does <br/>\nthe whole week&#39;s worth at one time so he can ignore it for the rest <br/>\nof the week). They might go out to a park...or not. Fridays they <br/>\nspend the afternoon at a homeschooling friend&#39;s house - their 3 boys <br/>\nand DS go run around and play while DH and the mom play Scrabble and <br/>\nRummikub. So, generically, the afternoon is playing. I get home, <br/>\nfeed the dog (unless DS has already done it or wants to do it once <br/>\nI&#39;m home), we have dinner. Sometimes DS eats at the table, sometimes <br/>\nhe chooses to take it to a stack table in the living room if he&#39;s <br/>\nmid-stream of watching something. After dinner, we might watch a <br/>\nmovie together or they might play more and I&#39;ll read or watch a <br/>\nmovie. We might go out and run an errand of some sort. During the <br/>\nsummer, Friday nights were spent at the drive in near us (yup we&#39;re <br/>\nlucky enough to have a double feature showing, 3 screen drive in <br/>\nabout 15 minutes away). Around 9:30 or 10, I head to bed. They&#39;ll <br/>\nusually head that way soon after. We may read, watch TV, whatever as <br/>\nthe day winds down. I&#39;m usually first asleep and they finish the <br/>\ngame, movie, TV program and drift off to sleep. Sometimes DH and I <br/>\nwill both be mostly asleep and DS will go to his room to read or <br/>\ndraw or play on his desktop computer for a while before coming back <br/>\nin to snuggle and fall asleep. It&#39;s about 50/50 whether I&#39;ll <br/>\nactually wake up enough to walk him back to his bed later (odds are <br/>\nhigher in the sticky humid summer weather than in the cold winter - <br/>\nhe&#39;s a nice handy little space heater!) And so it goes. <br/>\n<br/>\nDid you note that he might go read? He&#39;s 7. Never been to school. <br/>\nNever had a formal &#39;lesson&#39; or curriculum. Yet he reads. When we <br/>\nwere in the car the other day, he merrily spent time doubling <br/>\nnumbers - 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, then he got a little stuck so <br/>\nI filled in 1600, he did 3200, then we were at our destination. He <br/>\ncan also determine whether something is odd or even. And so on -<br/>\n &quot;math stuff&quot; - again, without any formal &#39;schooling&#39; in any form. <br/>\nLots of questions, answers, discussions, explorations. We decided <br/>\npretty much when he was born that we&#39;d unschool. So we didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave &#39;transitional&#39; issues to deal with.

What you have been trying to do is have your child do &quot;adult led learning&quot; but on her own.  Child led learning looks very, very different than school.  In fact, it looks pretty much nothing like school ....at least until your child and you have thoroughly, thoroughly de-schooled yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou posted that your child isn&#39;t interested in learning....tell her fine.  Blow it off.  Quit worrying about if learning is happening.  Just have fun, play, go to the beach, cook Indonesian food, spend time with older relatives hearing stories from their youth, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people ruin their attempts at unschooling because they keep trying to make sure learning is happening.  A child expresses an interest in horses and first thing you know, the parents have them hip-deep in documentaries, experiments, etc..  Sure fire way to quash an interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother big stumbling block is to take something fun...like the zoo and turn it into a lesson.  The schools do this with papers the kids must fill out about each exhibit.  Really, truly, quit worrying about the learning.  As long as the kids are having fun, they are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow about getting a job without a diploma.....lots of jobs don&#39;t require a diploma, lots of others you can just go get a GED in a few months at most and take off.

It might be college, it might be technical school, it might be an apprenticeship, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a HS diploma and graduated college with honors.  I have a Master&#39;s degree in Clinical Psychology and have no interest in pursuing that field anymore.  (When I just wanted to say &quot;quit whining&quot; to a client, I figured it was time to move on &lt;grin&gt;).  I am looking into training as a massage therapist and midwife, neither of which require hs diploma both can be fairly lucrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S./<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hi everyone, I am new and curious about Unschooling","postDate":"1127306920","msgId":6699,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzhDQzFFRDM0MzhFRC0xMENDLTYyMTZAbWJsay1yMjkuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGRncG91Yit2aHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRncG91Yit2aHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6695,"nextInTopic":6702,"prevInTime":6698,"nextInTime":6700,"topicId":6678,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Brace yourself! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nBut we DO like to hang around people who &quot;want to learn all about unschooling!&quot;<br/>\n*********<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read several books on Unschooling, including the teenage <br/>\nliberation hand book.<br/>\n <br/>\n*******<br/>\n <br/>\nPlease add the brand new _Parenting A Free Child: An Unschooled Life_ <br/>\nby Rue Kream to your list. Rue&#39;s a moderator and a regular poster on this list. She&#39;s <br/>\ncompiled a bunch of questions that we&#39;ve read over and over and put them---with answers---in<br/>\na beautiful book. <br/>\nFrank Smith&#39;s _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_ should be on your list as well.<br/>\n <br/>\n*******<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is one of my questions(I hope it makes sense)..way back long <br/>\nago, there were lots of children who did not finish &quot;school&quot;. Dropped <br/>\nout in 6th, 7th or 8th grade. I will assume that most of these <br/>\nchildren went on to help around the home, or helping out in a family <br/>\nsituation. And you always here &quot;I only had an 8th grade <br/>\neducation&quot;....so isn&#39;t unschooling similar to those who never finshed <br/>\nschool? Does that make sense??<br/>\n*****<br/>\nHmmmm... *Can be*. Depends on the &quot;drop-out&#39;s&quot; attitude. If he leaves school and <br/>\nthinks he&#39;s stupid and that learning sucks, well....no that&#39;s not the same thing. IF, <br/>\non the other hand, he leaves with his sense of self intact (often hard to do---all that<br/>\nsocietal stigma of &quot;uneducated&quot;) and with a burning desire to learn more and do more and <br/>\nBE more---well, he&#39;ll be just fine---in fact, probably *better* than the child who stays <br/>\nin school--- struggling and suffering &#39;til the bitter end.<br/>\n************<br/>\n How can you get along in a doggy-dog <br/>\nworld like this one without a formal education?<br/>\n <br/>\n********<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you look at the world as &quot;dog-eat-dog,&quot; that could be an issue. We see the world as a place<br/>\nFULL of wonderful, interesting, awe-inspiring things to be touched, viewed, poked, examined, <br/>\nand enjoyed.<br/>\n********<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the situation. I have a 12 yo that wants to do NOTHING, and I <br/>\nmean NOTHING. She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read. All <br/>\nshe does is sits around and watches TV, listens to her CD&#39;s and talks <br/>\non the phone when her friends come home. She is in her second year at <br/>\nhome. I pulled teeth with her last year, and this year it is the same <br/>\nthing. <br/>\n*******<br/>\nFirst question: What do *YOU* do?<br/>\nSecond question: What do 12 year olds DO? They are *very* interested in cultural/social <br/>\nsituations/interactions. They DO listen to music a lot. They DO watch a lot of tv. They DO <br/>\ntalk on the phone with their friends a lot. They DO want to hang out with peers. THAT&#39;S WHAT <br/>\n12 YEAR OLDS DO! They do MORE of that when they are denied other things they want to do.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are *just now* starting to be able to assert themselves. At 12, many are just about <br/>\nas tall as their parents (if not taller!). They are old enough to know that they can use the <br/>\nsame tactics on *you* that were used on *them*! Think about that! <br/>\n********<br/>\n<br/>\nShe takes Dance class twice a week. That&#39;s it.<br/>\n****<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, that&#39;s MORE than CDs, tv, and phone time. <br/>\nCan she take MORE dance classes?<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\nHow in the world can this child unschool, if she is not interested in <br/>\ndoing anything? She thinks learning is a waste of time. She really <br/>\ncould care less.<br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;s NOT UNschooling. She&#39;s still DEschooling. This is the hardest time in the whole <br/>\nprocess. She could stay in this funk for a long, long time. Hell, most schooled kids stay in <br/>\nit their entire LIVES! They become adults with no interests other than tv and football. <br/>\nStart ENJOYING her! Rent movies together---do a vertical of Johnny Depp. Rent Ferris Bueller&#39;s <br/>\nDay Off---GREAT Unschooling movie! &lt;G&gt; Encourage her to stay in her pj&#39;s all day. Order pizza <br/>\nfor lunch and watch movies all day---WITH HER! Let her pick them out. No fair pushing <br/>\nShakespeare if she doesn&#39;t want that. Be prepared for a day of horror flicks! &lt;bwg&gt; Have FUN!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nPaint each others&#39; nails and toes---even if you don&#39;t usually. Pretend that *YOU* are 12 <br/>\nagain!<br/>\n *********<br/>\nWe have gone from strict textbook approach, to unit studies, to trying to to just watch educational videos and read alouds. Nope. She sleeps until 11:00, and lays around. I am ready to send her back to school.<br/>\n <br/>\n********<br/>\n <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t trust you. THAT&#39;S what you need to work on now. Your relationship. Screw everything else! <br/>\n <br/>\nOH! And all that sleeping? Two things: 1) she&#39;s healing---that&#39;s what happens when we sleep; our bodies heal themselves. and 2) she&#39;s growing---this is a time of HUGE growth---both physically and mentally. She NEEDS sleep---desperately! <br/>\n <br/>\n*********<br/>\n <br/>\nI WANT to believe in child led learning. But I cannot get it out of my head that kids or adults who do not have an education, will not go far in this world. <br/>\n <br/>\n******<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s *your* problem that you&#39;ll have to come to terms with. *YOU* had an education. How far have *YOU* gone?<br/>\n <br/>\nI find it hysterical that professional athletes and actors are always hollering, &quot;Stay in school!&quot; Right---the two professions MOST likely to have ditched school. Cracks me up!<br/>\n <br/>\nBasically, the saying, &quot;Do what you love; the money will follow&quot; is spot on. Passions can take you much, much further than *ANY* curriculum!<br/>\n <br/>\n*********<br/>\n <br/>\n We do not live in an area that has many museums, or artsy stuff, or educational things(unless we want to visit Sturbridge village a million times)..I am not crafty, and barely got out of high school myself.<br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\nWhinewhinewhine. NO ONE lives in the perfect spot. Country people bitch about no culture. City folk bitch about no animals/nature. Suburbanites bitch about it all. Quit bitching and enjoy what you *have*! Plant a butterfly garden. Tile your bathroom. Volunteer at wildlife rescue.<br/>\n <br/>\nMAKE your own museum! MAKE your own art (see the ATCs---Ren? a link? We have been having SOOO much fun with these lately! )! And hell---EVERYTHING is educational!<br/>\n <br/>\n*****<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nIf someone can offer me a direction here and I would greatly appreciate it. <br/>\n <br/>\n*******<br/>\n <br/>\nWe need to model for our children what we&#39;d like to see in them. BE fun. Be creative. BE interesting. DO things. She&#39;ll follow. Slowly, at first, but she&#39;ll follow. Then she&#39;ll spurt ahead of you so fast, you won&#39;t know what happened!

Dog  <br/>\nshows. Ethnic restaurants. Renaissance fair. Tractor pulls. Shopping  <br/>\nin a town you&#39;ve never been to. Antique stores. Redecorate her room  <br/>\nto *her* specifications. (Keep your mouth shut if she wants to paint  <br/>\nthe ceiling green. (I did when I was a teen :-) But set a budget and  <br/>\ntalk about it realistically.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal, of course, is to treat everything the same. A monster truck  <br/>\nrally is no different than a Shakespeare play. it&#39;s either an  <br/>\ninterest or it&#39;s not. Rather than dividing the world into educational  <br/>\nand play (or waste of time or fun), the world should be divided into  <br/>\n&quot;of interest&quot; and &quot;not yet of interest&quot;. But she can&#39;t get there yet  <br/>\nuntil she feels confident that everything that was in the &quot;waste of  <br/>\ntime&quot; category is just as important as everything that was in the  <br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; category. To get there you need to be as happy that  <br/>\nshe&#39;s enjoying what she&#39;s doing right now as you&#39;d be if she was  <br/>\nreading Shakespeare. Join her in her world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She HATES Math with a passion, she HATES to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could be she&#39;ll always hate those because they aren&#39;t natural  <br/>\ninterests. It could be that once she&#39;s confident she can learn  <br/>\nsomething without it becoming a boring lesson, can stop when she  <br/>\nlikes, can pick it up when she likes and go no further than she  <br/>\nwants, that she will like those. Right now you have to let it go.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it like a broken leg on a world class runner. Wanting the  <br/>\nrunner to get back out running won&#39;t make the leg heal faster. It  <br/>\nmight in fact delay the healing because the runner would know she&#39;s  <br/>\ndisappointing you. And in fact she might start to feel that she&#39;s  <br/>\nonly worthwhile to you when she runs and if you can&#39;t see the worth  <br/>\nin her without the running then maybe she doesn&#39;t want to run again  <br/>\never.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to see the worth in her right now. Appreciate the person she  <br/>\nis right now. She needs to not feel that she&#39;ll only be worthwhile in  <br/>\nyour eyes when she&#39;s doing what you think is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you feel if your husband weighed and measured what you did  <br/>\nagainst his own yardstick and you were only &quot;good&quot; when you did  <br/>\nthings he thought were worthwhile and you were disappointing when you  <br/>\ndid things he thought were wastes of time?<br/>\n<br/>\nA really good book for parents of teens is Parent/Teen Breakthrough:  <br/>\nThe relationship approach. Basically you can&#39;t influence her  <br/>\npositively until she feels that her worth isn&#39;t tied to the choices  <br/>\nshe makes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She<br/>\n&gt; sleeps until 11:00, and lays around.

Often the same movie over and over  <br/>\nsince they had so few in rotation. It wouldn&#39;t have made me need to  <br/>\nrecover less if someone had decided I needed to go back to school to  <br/>\nstop watching TV.

Saying that<br/>\nshe is doing NOTHING is extremely negative, and I am<br/>\nguessing that she knows you don&#39;t approve of her<br/>\n&quot;nothing&quot; activities???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She HATES Math with a passion, she<br/>\n&gt; HATES to read. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My guess is that she has either been in public school<br/>\nor be doing school-at-home?

Unschooling is about<br/>\nliving a joyful life, with the freedom to pursue her<br/>\ninterests, regardless of whether they seem educational<br/>\nor not.
