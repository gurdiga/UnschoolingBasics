What Do the letters g and j actually &quot;say&quot;? Not to mention c and s. For kids who like puzzles, that makes figuring out the language code a really big, really fun puzzle - so keep that in mind with your daughter. How might you approach helping her with some other puzzle? It&#39;s okay to offer little tidbits of information and see if she wants them, or not, or wants more - my daughter didn&#39;t want much information at all, though. She wanted to figure it out, and she did. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the interesting things, watching Mo learn to read and write using the names of letters as her pronunciation guide, was that it was much easier to figure all of that out in the context of reading than writing. It didn&#39;t take her long to start reading, and it really didn&#39;t take her long to come up with a coherent system of her own for spelling... she just didn&#39;t start out trying to spell things &quot;right&quot; but went straight for &quot;logical&quot;. So all /k/ sounds were k, and she worked out a system for when she would use c and when s - or z, and the same with g/j. I would occasionally drop little tidbits of information, and sometimes she&#39;d ask me to spell something - and that&#39;s still the case, now that she&#39;s 10. She spells about as well as friends the same age who do daily spelling drills.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Sounding things out...","postDate":"1335610704","msgId":48418,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzQTg4M0Y0LTFBQzAtNDM4NS05RUUxLTk1QzZFNUJEMDg0RkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpuZWp0cSs2YjEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpuZWp0cSs2YjEzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48417,"nextInTopic":48420,"prevInTime":48417,"nextInTime":48419,"topicId":48417,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
