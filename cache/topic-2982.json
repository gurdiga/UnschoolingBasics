If","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-382999361\">Way back when ds was attending a Montessori school the headmistress had this<br/>\npolicy:  If they don&#39;t want to get dressed, let them come in their pajamas.<br/>\nIf they get there and do feel embarrassed, they are free to change into<br/>\nclothes from their cubby, which all kids had in case of spills or accidents.<br/>\nLots of kids did this from time to time.  Some thought it was fun or funny<br/>\nto wear their pj&#39;s to school and others just wanted to see what would<br/>\nhappen.  I&#39;m sure some were trying to communicate that they didn&#39;t want to<br/>\ngo to school that day.  Those kids would have to move on to stomachaches I<br/>\nguess to get out of school.  Sad, but the reason I mention it is to show how<br/>\ndifferent it looks when the idea is to go with the kid&#39;s choice as opposed<br/>\nto &quot;letting him learn his lesson.&quot;  I agree that I am the mom, a little<br/>\nolder and perhaps with access to more information sometimes.  That is why I<br/>\nmight grab a set of clothes I know he likes, knowing he might feel<br/>\ndifferently when we get there.  Better yet, knowing what I know now, I&#39;d<br/>\ndeclare that he doesn&#39;t have to go at all if he doesn&#39;t want to.  Wish I&#39;d<br/>\ndone that more back then.  We may have come to home schooling sooner!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2981,"nextTopicId":2983}}
