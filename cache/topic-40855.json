And, that the kids will be going back to school.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids don&#39;t have to go to school because you work. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing back into a profession you had before kids or before unschooling is not your only option.  And if you had  profession before unschooling consider whether it is something you can do from home. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider starting a janitorial service where you can work after banks and real estate offices close.  We know a guy cleans three banks and a couple of insurance offices.  He starts work at 5:15pm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time of year shipping companies are hiring for the Christmas season.  Warehouse jobs are usually some hours in the early morning and some hours again at night.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStart a baked goods business, bake at home in the early morning hours, deliver your stuff while your kids are still asleep and be home all day. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet your CDL and drive a school bus.  Couple hours in the morning and<br/>\na couple in the afternoon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStart a delivery service business and fetch groceries for old ladies. The kids can come with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nStart a lawn care business and mow lawns in the evenings. (Or rake or haul yard debris away or weed flower beds or scoop doggie doo.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWork with your husbands schedule, consider trade outs with other moms.<br/>\nOffer something you have in exchange for sitter services.  Look for jobs that offer lots of hours over a shorter week so you only have to figure out kid care for three days or jobs where you could have your kids with you sometimes or jobs where you can work at night, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nPutting the kids in school won&#39;t solve your child care problem.  You&#39;d still have to find child care in the summer, over holidays and when your kids are sick and can&#39;t go to school, so why not put energy into that kind of problem solving now and keep them out of school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40837,"nextTopicId":40856}}
