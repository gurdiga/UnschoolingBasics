We travel all over our state. We have had many wonderful times<br/>\ntogether that way. Jon and I have a great relationship. He sometimes<br/>\ntakes his anger out on me because I am the safe one. Then we talk and<br/>\nthings calm down again. He knows I am there for him because that is the<br/>\nway it has always been. I will talk to him about this too. See if he has<br/>\nany interest in the history of fishing, etc. For the most part we<br/>\nunschool. Although I still know in the back of my head I need to fit it<br/>\ninto the guidelines set by the state. I work around that.
