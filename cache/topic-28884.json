In the event of an untimely <br/>\ndeath of myself, my husband would probably put the children in school, <br/>\nhow would I prepare them for school grade levels when unschooling.  I <br/>\nhave been cancer free for 20 years now, but this crazy thought enters <br/>\nmy head when I begin to think of homeschooling.  We have used a few <br/>\ncirriculums over the last 8 years, mostly Abeka, but I can see that <br/>\nsome of what I am asking of them  is not allowing their own personal <br/>\ninner selves to truly shine.  Thanks for all comments on this subject. <br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28874,"nextTopicId":28850}}
