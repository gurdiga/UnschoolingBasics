It is never too late","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-756105941\">I didn&#39;t start that old, but my son is 14, too, and I wish, wish, <br/>\nWISH I had started homeschooling sooner.  (We started after 5th <br/>\ngrade.)  It is never too late -- I know someone locally who started <br/>\nhsing this year, and her son is 14, also.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBored kids especially can benefit.  I know all those years in brick <br/>\nand mortar school (most of it was in private, half a year was <br/>\npublic) taught my son some bad habits, how not to concentrate on the <br/>\ntask at hand (if he did, he would be done too soon, then have to be <br/>\nbored, or &quot;rewarded&quot; with more work of their choosing....)  There is <br/>\nnothing that says, if you want, that you even have to wait until the <br/>\nend of the year.  (Nothing says you can&#39;t, either.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest suggestion is to try to get connected with other <br/>\nhomeschooling teens and tweens in your area.  I think one of the <br/>\nbiggest draws can be friends.  If there is a social structure out of <br/>\nschool, he may be more inclined to continue homeschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a ready-made teen homeschool group, great, join it!  <br/>\n(And you can generally join these before you start hsing -- a great <br/>\nway to get support from people in the same stage of child-rearing.  <br/>\nThose with 10 yr olds don&#39;t really understand the issues of a 14 yr <br/>\nold as well as those with teens!)  If there isn&#39;t -- join whatever <br/>\ngroups there are in the area (not a bad idea, anyway), and start a <br/>\ngroup of your own.  When we moved to our current location, there was <br/>\nnone, so I started one.  A lot of people have made connections that <br/>\nhadn&#39;t previously.  I think part of why there are as few older <br/>\nhomeschoolers in this area is due to the lack of activities geared <br/>\nfor older kids.  (A field trip geared to elementary kids tends to be <br/>\nho-hum to teens!)  The activities can run the gamut from a park day <br/>\n(yes, older kids do actually enjoy running around a playground on <br/>\noccasion!) to game days, to discussion groups, whatever they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, the &quot;schooly&quot; part of our day is the least of it -- my <br/>\nson has FINALLY (after nearly 4 yrs) rediscovered his focus, as well <br/>\nas discovering (and acknowledging -- I knew for years he is a <br/>\nmorning person, but he only acknowledged it about 3-4 weeks ago) his <br/>\nbest time of day, the time he thinks best, etc.  Self-discovery is <br/>\nimportant, and takes time.  But now we have the freedom to do what <br/>\nwe are interested in doing!  Make sure your son has plenty of time <br/>\nfor HIS interests!  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be surprised at how your relationship with him changes.  You <br/>\nwill find yourself having conversations with him that you never <br/>\nthought you would, about any variety of topics, and you may discover <br/>\nhe can come up with solutions to some of your own problems that you <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have come up with.  It is really neat to see how your child <br/>\nis developing and growing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best, Linda<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Shannon&quot; <br/>\n&lt;loonsongcreations@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My (youngest) son turned 14 in February and is in grade 8 in a <br/>\n&gt; Christian school.
