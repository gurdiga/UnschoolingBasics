It happens.   There are new concepts suddenly<br/>\nclicking in your head and making so much sense you *know* they have to be<br/>\ntrue, but you have twenty or thirty or more years of traditional thinking<br/>\nto overcome and the details of that thinking still live in your head<br/>\nalongside the new stuff.   How long have you had kids and how long did<br/>\nyou parent them in the usual ways?  It&#39;s a lifetime of pre programmed<br/>\n&quot;how to&#39;s&quot; to overcome.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d hate to see you go to a (so called) support list because there, a<br/>\nbunch of insecure people stumbling at unschooling start to commiserate<br/>\nand that old thinking gets loud again - and most of the time the<br/>\n&quot;support&quot; comes from that comfortable old kind of thinking.  It might<br/>\nmake you feel better temporarily, feel understood, but it won&#39;t get you<br/>\ncloser to a full and deep understanding of the unschooling philosophy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since we aren&#39;t a religious cult and can&#39;t make you give up all your<br/>\nworldly possessions and forbid contact with outsiders, you&#39;re free to do<br/>\na search at Yahoo for unschooling support or some such and see what you<br/>\ncan find.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery unschooler had moments of doubt.

You<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t make him &quot;know&quot; about politics or writing.  You could go through<br/>\nall the struggles to get him to do the prescribed work and you could feel<br/>\nbetter about your part but your goal is not to absolve yourself, I hope. <br/>\nThat&#39;s what a rigorous academic course would do for you, it would absolve<br/>\nyou.  What would it do for your son? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t spell well and the only one who makes fun of me is Kelly. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nBut Kelly would make fun of me for something else anyway so the spelling<br/>\nthing hardly matters.   I know quite a lot about politics and what I know<br/>\nis it&#39;s ever changing and always the same. &lt;g&gt;   I write all the time and<br/>\npeople poke fun at that but I consider it a  nice change from the usual<br/>\npoking about unschooling or veganism or bird watching or, or, or...&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nMy not very subtle point is someone, somewhere, will find a way to be<br/>\nunsettled by something or other.   Being a good speller or writer or<br/>\nbeing politically savvy won&#39;t change that.  Better to be the kind of<br/>\nperson who can manage the pokes of life then the kind of person stressed<br/>\nby trying to be unpokable.  Or something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***Feeling like you are doing the wrong thing to<br/>\nhelp prepare your child for a harsh world in which competition and<br/>\n&#39;academic&#39; knowledge are a major part of? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t found the world to be that harsh or maybe we&#39;ve made our lives<br/>\naway from the harshness.  I&#39;ve worked at different jobs and I&#39;ve had my<br/>\nown business and while there are always challenges I&#39;ve never found life<br/>\nespecially competitive or academic.  There are certainly fields that are<br/>\nmore competitive but if one is going into such a field then I&#39;m guessing<br/>\none would be the kind of person could cope with the stress of<br/>\ncompetition.

My husband can&#39;t spell worth beans but <br/>\n&gt; spell check works great for him and he makes a darn good living for <br/>\n&gt; us and has an extremely high IQ so I don&#39;t think it has effected his <br/>\n&gt; life in a negative way at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really do honestly believe that too, actually &quot;know&quot; would be a<br/>\nbetter word.  I know it has no bearing on a persons intelligence,Zak<br/>\nhas an active and thoughtful mind.  <br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of the things that I was really concerned about was my sons <br/>\n&gt; grammar and it was the one thing that I would wake up in the middle <br/>\n&gt; of the night worrying about, even though I never mentioned or pushed <br/>\n&gt; it at all.  He is now 13 and has wonderful spelling, punctuation, <br/>\n&gt; and grammar!!  He didn&#39;t learn it from me because I never gave him a <br/>\n&gt; formal lesson but he picked it up from somewhere, namely unlimited <br/>\n&gt; computer use and lots of reading.   <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Heidi, that is so wonderful.  With gaming and email and IMing it&#39;s<br/>\nhard for children not to want to write, is it?  :-)  Mine do the same<br/>\nand I do see marked improvement.  My dh last week had a fit &quot;How does<br/>\nZak &#39;know&#39; what a comma is if someone doesn&#39;t teach him?&quot;  I told him<br/>\nthat the philosophy of unschooling is that if he comes across a comma,<br/>\nand wants to know what it is, he&#39;ll ask.  Other than that, because of<br/>\nreading, he&#39;ll come across commas and many children over a period of<br/>\ntime will recognize that it comes during a &#39;pause&#39;.  He was very irate<br/>\nand said that he doesn&#39;t want Zak falling behind and that he is<br/>\nworried.  I stood my ground though and politely told DH that if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to read and take the time to learn about unschooling then<br/>\nreally he needs to just trust me.  Of course when I woke the next<br/>\nmorning crying and saying how horrid it felt not to be trusted he felt<br/>\nlike shit (and rightfully so) and apologized several times throughout<br/>\nthe day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say &#39;grammar&#39; are you referring to the eight parts: <br/>\nPrepositions, dissecting sentences and all that good stuff or do you<br/>\nmean grammar as in the way people speak via being around others who<br/>\nspeak?  I for the life of me cannot figure out the importance of<br/>\nknowing any formal grammar but I know that it&#39;s tested.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\nthere is probably a prep course should my kids ever want to take a<br/>\nPSAT/SAT...hopefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How old is your son?  Sometimes these fears arise out of fear of <br/>\n&gt; what people will think of us if our kids are not &quot;up to grade <br/>\n&gt; level&quot;.  He isn&#39;t in school so you need not worry if he is learning <br/>\n&gt; at a different pace than someone else and you certainly don&#39;t need <br/>\n&gt; to worry about spelling in a world with spell check.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He is 11 and you know, I really shouldn&#39;t be even trying to compare<br/>\neither of my kids with schooled kids because mine may never be<br/>\ninterested in learning anything that they do so there really isn&#39;t a<br/>\n&#39;pace&#39; that I should concern myself with anyway (speaking to myself<br/>\nhere) DD (8) uses spell check on everything and she loves it...so do I!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My other son will be 11 this summer and is just beginning to read on <br/>\n&gt; his own.  I never worried because my sister&#39;s son was 11 or 12 <br/>\n&gt; before he learned how to read and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if he <br/>\n&gt; learned to read at 6 or just recently.  Every child is unique and <br/>\n&gt; the more you let go the more you will see learning happening all on <br/>\n&gt; its own.  Take ten deep breaths................................<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow!  I didnï¿½t know that Renï¿½s son didnï¿½t read until then, but I knew<br/>\nthat he only recently started to enjoy writing.  Your analogy stands<br/>\nout, big time and I do ï¿½get itï¿½.  J  I feel the same when it comes to<br/>\nbabies walking, so your kid walked at 8 months and another at 1 ï¿½<br/>\nyears..you canï¿½t tell now.  Heidi, I will do just that, take big<br/>\nbreaths and relaxï¿½with my going to my Moms in two weeks Iï¿½ll need it,<br/>\nshe showed disgust and disapproval when she found out we do not do<br/>\ngrammar lessons.  Again with the dam grammar, itï¿½s the FORMAL study of<br/>\na language, so unless one is going to be a Grammar teacher, what is<br/>\nthe purpose of studying it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Heidi!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy Winn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175529137,"authorName":"aplan4life","from":"&quot;aplan4life&quot; &lt;aplan4life@...&gt;","profile":"aplan4life","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling Support Group Recommendation...","postDate":"1146441386","msgId":12668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUzM2lyYSt2cTRrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0MzAyMDA2MjI1Mi4yNjQ4LjQ0NTUzRkE0MDAwNjY3NEYwMDAwMEE1ODIyMDY0MjQ2MTMwRTAzMDMwMTAzMDIwQTk2QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":12665,"nextInTopic":12681,"prevInTime":12667,"nextInTime":12669,"topicId":12657,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Alright here goes...
