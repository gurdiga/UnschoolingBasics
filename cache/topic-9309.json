My FIL has <br/>\ndiabetes, my dh is very skeptical of letting go of food controls, but fast <br/>\nforward now 5 years ahead to today, this moment. Food controls were slowly <br/>\nlifted for the past several years with the last 3 uncontrolled, except sometimes <br/>\nmy dh wigs out on the amount of ice cream the kids enjoy. Riley requested a <br/>\ngiant candy cane for holiday. He has always wanted one, so for a play I gave him one on closing night. He loves plain candy canes, pretty much a favorite candy. He has kept his huge one in his room, in a baggy and periodically he would gnaw on it, it&#39;s that big, like 1 inch diameter and a foot long. Maybe 2 inches have been consumed since early dec. when he recieved it. He picked it up today, gnawed on it as I was making lunch. Riley doesn&#39;t gravitate towards fruits, but he does enjoy frozen berries of all sorts, so to start his lunch I gave him a bowl of frozen rasberries. He handed me the candy cane and said, &quot; could you put this away, no..., throw it in the trash.&quot; So, he ate about 1/10th of a huge amount of sugar savoring it until he was finished and then threw the rest away. He did the same recently with soda, a few sips and then gave it to his dad. So food controlling lead my guy up into the cupboard for more and releasing the controls he throws things out when he has had his fill. <br/>\n<br/>\nMary</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9299,"nextTopicId":9316}}
