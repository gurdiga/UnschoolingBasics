You probably now have the hardest job of all parenting and that is letting him make his own mistakes, while also letting him know he can come to you anytime and there will be no recriminations or judgements or anything - the prodigal son thing, right?

My 17yo son","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-384644732\">I don&#39;t know if anyone can help me with this. It may be beyond the <br/>\nparameters of this group. I&#39;m struggling with what to do about this <br/>\nsituation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 17yo son went to live with his previously absent father on the <br/>\n1st of this year. His father is very irresponsible. He has no idea <br/>\nhow to take care of himself, much less provide for another person. <br/>\nHe took one of my son&#39;s only two pairs of shoes right after he moved <br/>\nthere. They&#39;ve had their electricity turned off 3 or 4 times. My <br/>\nmom, against my objections, signed a car she had over to his dad&#39;s <br/>\ndad for my son to use. My son&#39;s driver&#39;s permit was revoked because <br/>\nhe wasn&#39;t attending school in NC and his dad couldn&#39;t be relied upon <br/>\nto take him to DMV to get a VA license. Currently, the car is not <br/>\nlegally registered or insured but my son is still driving it. My son <br/>\nhas told me many times that he doesn&#39;t have any food. His dad <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really have a job. He sporadically works for his father, who <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t always pay everyone. We gave our son a cell phone because <br/>\nhis dad can&#39;t seem to keep a phone active. His dad takes the phone <br/>\nand uses it himself and leaves our son with no phone or any other <br/>\nway to contact anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI still have full legal custody of my son. There is no child support <br/>\norder that requires us to give his dad any money. We don&#39;t mind <br/>\nproviding them with money to help with our son&#39;s necessities. <br/>\nHowever, it is becoming more and more evident that not much of any <br/>\nmoney we give them will go to necessities for our son. We don&#39;t want <br/>\nour son to go hungry but we also don&#39;t like the idea of having to <br/>\nsupport his dad. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband said he was going to buy food and ship it to our son. <br/>\nI&#39;ve gotten suggestions to send him gift cards for grocery stores so <br/>\nwe&#39;d at least know the money was being spent on food even if it is <br/>\nfor everyone, including their roommate. I&#39;ve also gotten suggestions <br/>\nthat I shouldn&#39;t give my son anything. If he&#39;s choosing to live <br/>\nthere, he needs to experience the full consequences of that. That <br/>\nseems pretty harsh and not very generous or unconditional. I want to <br/>\nsupport my son but I also don&#39;t want to make it easy for him to <br/>\nadopt his dad&#39;s lifestyle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33216,"nextTopicId":33268}}
