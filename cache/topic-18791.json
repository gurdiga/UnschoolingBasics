My other 3 children had been sleeping for over an hour at this <br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe knock woke my husband and he answered the door. I was in the <br/>\nkitchen nursing the youngest. It was a police officer telling us he <br/>\nreceived a call about a domestic disturbance. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo say we were surprised and shocked was a understatement. The <br/>\nofficer talked to my husband a bit and then asked to see me to be <br/>\nsure everything was alright. After talking with me and seeing that <br/>\neverything was ok he left.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my husband mentioned to me that a friend he told about the <br/>\nincident warned him that even if their wasn&#39;t a problem that often <br/>\nchildren and family services will pay a visit after something like <br/>\nthis. He suggested we be on our guard. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a good family with good kids and we can&#39;t understand this. <br/>\nWhat makes this worse is the fact that for a year now I have been <br/>\nreceiving letters in the mail telling me my husband has been cheating <br/>\non me, etc. (He&#39;s not trust me, I even have proof.) We had to change <br/>\nour phone number because of phone calls and even my internet address <br/>\nbecause they would send e-mails there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to this my next door neighbor keeps complaining about the <br/>\nnoise level of our children. She complains about the yelling, loud <br/>\ntalking, etc that she hears over here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children, although basically good kids, are very rowdy by nature. <br/>\nThey play and talk very loudly and often yell during their games. <br/>\nI&#39;ve suggested to them to tone it down, but that hasn&#39;t had any <br/>\neffect. ( They are 10 yr, 8 yr, 3 yr and 17 months old)The noise <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother my husband and I, but we don&#39;t want any troble. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are now worried and concerned. We don&#39;t want <br/>\nanything to happen to us or the children. We also worry because have <br/>\njust started unschooling in February this year. If the authorities do <br/>\nget called on us will we be in trouble? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are unschooling under an umbrella school in Florida that only <br/>\nrequires attendance. Although my children are involved in a lot of <br/>\nthings, read frequently and do educational things on the computer I <br/>\nhave no evidence of what they&#39;ve done and learned during this time. <br/>\n(which is tons) Could that be used against us? I did write stuff down <br/>\nin a notebook but it was accidentally destroyed so I no longer have <br/>\nit.

You might want to compile a chronology of the harrassment and report it. Also, if the responding officer was required to complete a report after visiting your house, you may be able to get it. It would not have the reporting party&#39;s information, but the officer may have put down verbiage in there that would give you more information such as &quot;responding to reports of a woman screaming&quot; or &quot;responding to  reports of a child crying&quot; at such and such an address. If he filed no report you are out of luck on that score, but you may be able to get information from the dispath center. They cannot tell you who the reporting party was, but they may give you the verbiage used by the caller, which could alert you as to where it came from, such as the neighbor. I worked as a police dispatcher and there was information we were allowed to give the public, such as time the call was placed, who the responding officer was, whether a <br/>\nreport was filed, time of dispatch and arrival, etc. Keep a record of this stuff, I would. But dont be too paranoid about the unschooling. You are doing nothing illegal. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;thisismaggiesemailaddress&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:thisismaggiesemailaddress@...\">thisismaggiesemailaddress@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nHi,<br/>\nI was hoping someone could share with me their thoughts on this and <br/>\nmaybe some advice. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night after my family had all gone to bed and only our youngest, <br/>\nage 17 months and I were awake, I was startled by a loud knock at the <br/>\ndoor. My other 3 children had been sleeping for over an hour at this <br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe knock woke my husband and he answered the door. I was in the <br/>\nkitchen nursing the youngest. It was a police officer telling us he <br/>\nreceived a call about a domestic disturbance. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo say we were surprised and shocked was a understatement. The <br/>\nofficer talked to my husband a bit and then asked to see me to be <br/>\nsure everything was alright. After talking with me and seeing that <br/>\neverything was ok he left.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, my husband mentioned to me that a friend he told about the <br/>\nincident warned him that even if their wasn&#39;t a problem that often <br/>\nchildren and family services will pay a visit after something like <br/>\nthis. He suggested we be on our guard. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a good family with good kids and we can&#39;t understand this. <br/>\nWhat makes this worse is the fact that for a year now I have been <br/>\nreceiving letters in the mail telling me my husband has been cheating <br/>\non me, etc. (He&#39;s not trust me, I even have proof.) We had to change <br/>\nour phone number because of phone calls and even my internet address <br/>\nbecause they would send e-mails there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to this my next door neighbor keeps complaining about the <br/>\nnoise level of our children. She complains about the yelling, loud <br/>\ntalking, etc that she hears over here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children, although basically good kids, are very rowdy by nature. <br/>\nThey play and talk very loudly and often yell during their games. <br/>\nI&#39;ve suggested to them to tone it down, but that hasn&#39;t had any <br/>\neffect. ( They are 10 yr, 8 yr, 3 yr and 17 months old)The noise <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t bother my husband and I, but we don&#39;t want any troble. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I are now worried and concerned. We don&#39;t want <br/>\nanything to happen to us or the children. We also worry because have <br/>\njust started unschooling in February this year. If the authorities do <br/>\nget called on us will we be in trouble? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are unschooling under an umbrella school in Florida that only <br/>\nrequires attendance. Although my children are involved in a lot of <br/>\nthings, read frequently and do educational things on the computer I <br/>\nhave no evidence of what they&#39;ve done and learned during this time. <br/>\n(which is tons) Could that be used against us?
