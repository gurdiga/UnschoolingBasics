It is so nice to hear a very<br/>\nsuccessful story!!! Congratulations! I have a 16yr old who I homeschooled<br/>\nfrom 4-9th grades, and a 5 yr old that I am unschooling.  I had never heard<br/>\nof unschooling until just last year and I love it.  My 16yr old is in<br/>\npublic high school too, her strength is in music and singing which is why<br/>\nshe loves public school.  My youngest is more like me, a bit of a rebel<br/>\nalways wanting to do things as independently as possible.  I to was<br/>\nhomeschooled in the late 70&#39;s/early 80&#39;s by my Mom using the Calvert school<br/>\nprogram.  I really enjoyed it, and know that I would&#39;ve really enjoyed<br/>\nunschooling even more.  Anyway I just wanted to say welcome and thanks for<br/>\nsharing!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Angie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jan 31, 2012 at 10:20 AM, Sarah &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sunflowermorning31@...\">sunflowermorning31@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello All, This is just a short blurb to intro us to the group.
