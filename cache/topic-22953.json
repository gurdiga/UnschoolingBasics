It discusses how parents&#39; fear of abduction is fed by the media, but that the fear is generally WAY out of proportion with the actual risk.  The author&#39;s concern is how this parental fear drastically limits kids&#39; access to natural, unstructured outdoor play.  That section also discusses how playing in the natural world is an excellent way to help tune a child&#39;s &quot;risk radar&quot; since it awakens their senses. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The book also relates to another current thread on this list about encouraging kids to spend time outside.  He gives scores of examples of ways to make outdoor experiences more enriching and enjoyable, as well as explaining why so many &quot;structured&quot; outdoor experiences leave many kids bored and uninspired.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  The other section I loved was about using nature the enhance education.  Since we&#39;ll be buying a house when we settle back in the US soon, I&#39;ll definitely be looking into the references he gives about landscaping which promotes unstructured outdoor play and thus learning.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  As with so many of the books I&#39;ve read lately, this one is full to the brim with &quot;unschooly&quot; concepts although I&#39;m pretty certain the authors probably don&#39;t realize it. ;)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Here&#39;s the link to Amazon with tons of five-star reviews of the book: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Last-Child-Woods-Children-Nature-Deficit/dp/1565125223/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1157777-1485706?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175602633&sr=8-1\">http://www.amazon.com/Last-Child-Woods-Children-Nature-Deficit/dp/1565125223/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1157777-1485706?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175602633&sr=8-1</a> <br/>\n   <br/>\n  K, gotta go pack so more while Jake naps!!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Julie H.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Abduction statistics","postDate":"1175537699","msgId":22953,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGM5MS45YWNjYzI3LjMzNDJhMjIzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22962,"prevInTime":22952,"nextInTime":22954,"topicId":22953,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"According to the FBI s statistics of kidnapping children in America, strangers kidnap about 300 children every year.

The risk is much less than death by MVA.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~~~~~~<br/>\n <br/>\nJohn Stossel recently had a show about fear in America.  He discussed the <br/>\ntopic of child abduction as it is one of parents&#39; biggest fears and compared the <br/>\nstatistics to other things people fear including terrorism, MVA&#39;s and flying <br/>\nairplanes.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact numbers but he said something to the <br/>\neffect that we are many, many times more likely to be struck by lightning than we <br/>\nare of having a child abducted. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I have a friend that was molested as a child by an Uncle. One of her big <br/>\npet peeves is the parent that &quot;makes&quot; their child hug everyone as they leave a <br/>\nrelatives house or a friends house. For that reason I let my children choose <br/>\nwho they want to hug or not. Just because it&#39;s a relative does not mean my girls <br/>\nhave to hug or kiss them if they are not comfortable with it. <br/>\nKelly&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGross!  One huge fear of mine is that one of my children will be molested.  <br/>\nFifteen years ago some friends and I had a *sisters* weekend. We had an intense <br/>\ndiscussion about rape and molestation and 8 out of 11 of the women in our <br/>\ngroup admitted to having been molested in one way or another during their <br/>\nchildhoods.  All but one was hurt by a family member and only one of the 8 had told <br/>\nher parents as a child.  Eight women in one room whose abuse was never <br/>\nreported.  My friend who did tell her parents (about grampy fondling her) said her <br/>\nfather punched him in the face and told him not to touch her again but never <br/>\ncalled the police. So many more people have been molested than is reported so the <br/>\nstatistics aren&#39;t even close to being accurate.  Like molestation, most <br/>\nabductions are by family members rather than strangers so it is probable that the <br/>\npet store guy was not an abductor but I have to admit that I was creeped out <br/>\nwhen I read the story about this stranger handing the boy a turtle and then <br/>\nrefusing his younger sister&#39;s request.  My first thought was --Oooh, he prefers <br/>\nlittle boys--but I stopped myself because I know I&#39;ve become paranoid about <br/>\nperpetrators since learning that so many of my friends were molested. I was glad to <br/>\nread that others on this list were alarmed as well.  I thought about what it <br/>\nwas that sparked the creeps in me and it was this: If the stranger in the <br/>\nstore was just being nice by handing the boy the turtle, why wasn&#39;t he equally <br/>\nnice to the little girl? A truly kid friendly guy would have gone back to the <br/>\ntank and brought the little (screaming) girl a turtle.  This *nice* guy actually <br/>\ncaused the problems for the poster and her daughter.  He could have been <br/>\nfriendly without crossing appropriate boundaries. He could have (should have) asked <br/>\nthe young boy&#39;s mother if it was okay to hand him a turtle, then it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nseem creepy or inappropriate at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing that we haven&#39;t touched upon in this discussion is that the child <br/>\nwho accepted the turtle should be reminded that if a similar situation happens <br/>\nin the future that you&#39;d like him to check with you before taking *anything* <br/>\nfrom a stranger. <br/>\n <br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin in MA, glad that the world is full of good people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23019,"nextTopicId":22884}}
