If so that<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have anything to do with not being able to homeschool.  What the law<br/>\nsays is that if a child is enrolled in school and misses 15 days in a 90 day<br/>\nperiod that child is considered truant.  What the law does say is that you<br/>\ncan&#39;t just say, &quot;Oh we homeschool&quot; if your child is still enrolled in<br/>\nschool.  You either are homeschooling and following one of the several ways<br/>\nin which one can homeschool in Florida or you are truant.  If you do say you<br/>\nare homeschooling the school district can request a copy of your portfolio<br/>\nwith a 2 weeks&#39; notice or otherwise prove that you were homeschooling before<br/>\nthe child became truant.  While I may not agree with the laws regarding<br/>\neducation, I believe that it is the responsibility of the parent(s) to<br/>\nadhere to those laws and challenge them in legal venues.  If a parent can&#39;t<br/>\nprovide the burden of proof that they have actually been homeschooling then<br/>\nthey are indeed, by law, truant and should face the penalty which comes with<br/>\nit.  It isn&#39;t hard to homeschool in this state and there is nothing hard<br/>\nabout withdrawing a student from school to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t find anything that says that a troubled child can&#39;t homeschool.<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked through the hslda files for Florida and through Florida<br/>\nhomeschool laws and can&#39;t find anything to that effect.  Do you have a link<br/>\nto that information?  I&quot;m not defending FPEA at all, just had never heard<br/>\nthat truant or troubled students *can&#39;t* homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anyone in Florida?","postDate":"1149644110","msgId":14108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3OC40ODBhNDE2LjMxYjc4NzRlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14107,"nextInTopic":14111,"prevInTime":14107,"nextInTime":14109,"topicId":14098,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/6/2006 8:53:32 P.M.
