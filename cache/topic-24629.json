I joined because I<br/>\nam curious about unschooling, radical, . I have been doing this all along I<br/>\nguess but now the time is coming up when everyone is asking me what we are<br/>\ndoing about our son in the fall. I&#39;m sure that comes up a lot in here. So I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have any particular questions right now but I thought I&#39;d post  my<br/>\nintro before I&#39;m a member for 2 years and forget (that could happen!).<br/>\nI am Jen a sahm of 2 kids. Ben is 5, Hannah is 4 and Noah is 20mo. We live<br/>\nin San Diego, CA. We are an AP family and we belong to several AP groups<br/>\nlocally. I run a weekly AP playgroup for all ages but my Ben is the oldest<br/>\nin the group. I really opened the group so that I could hook him up with<br/>\nsome friends his age, but no one came :( . Anyway, it is a large group.<br/>\nAnyway, we plan on homeschooling them in the fall (supposed to be in K) but<br/>\nhaven&#39;t really made any decision on HOW! So that&#39;s why I&#39;m here....to learn<br/>\nfrom you!<br/>\nThanks for having me!<br/>\nJen<br/>\n<br/>\n==========================<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach The Bradley MethodR natural childbirth<br/>\n<br/>\nContact me for more info:  &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iluv2rlx@...\">iluv2rlx@...</a>&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:iluv2rlx@...\">iluv2rlx@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re always up to something new:  &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/\">http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/\">http://monkeyfamily.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2392,"nextTopicId":24633}}
