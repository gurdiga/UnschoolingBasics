In terms of kids who are still deschooling though,  <br/>\nthe workbooks are not the best option because it&#39;s not the challenge  <br/>\nthe child enjoys, it&#39;s the predictability and ease in being able to  <br/>\nprovide just the right answer.  Does that make sense? So whenever  <br/>\nsomeone asks if unschoolers *can* use workbooks, I always appreciate  <br/>\nsomeone saying *why* do they want them, rather than just &#39;yes&#39; or  <br/>\n&#39;no&#39;.

To her they are the<br/>\nsame as my doing a sudoku puzzle book.  She enjoys the challenge of<br/>\nthe &quot;puzzles&quot; in the book.  She likes numbers and has never felt<br/>\ndaunted by mathematics.  I buy her these workbooks when she asks and<br/>\nthey sit on the &quot;art shelf&quot; in our hobby room right next to the<br/>\ncoloring books, crayons, balsa wood airplanes, and some modelling<br/>\nclay.  They are no more nor less important than anything else on that<br/>\nshelf.  For her they are fun and enjoyable.  Is she learning<br/>\nsomething.  Sure.  Am I thrilled?  Sure.  Am I anymore thrilled that<br/>\nshe is doing a math workbook than if she had chosen to pick up the<br/>\nmodelling clay and build a tiny graveyard in the style of Tim Burton?<br/>\nNo.  I&#39;m thrilled, not that she is doing math, but that she is at ease<br/>\nin life enough that she knows that I weigh modelling clay to equal the<br/>\nsame in importance as I do a math workbook (that she asked for).  And<br/>\nshe will leave the math workbook alone for weeks or sometimes months<br/>\n(just like the clay might be left alone for weeks or months).  Then<br/>\none week she might see them again and spend the next few days doing<br/>\nnothing but math workbooks.  We might even have to go to the store and<br/>\nfind more workbooks.  The week after that it might be the modelling<br/>\nclay and she is building a giant scene from  Corpse Bride across our<br/>\nworkdesk.  We might even have to go to the store to find more clay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do unschoolers use coloring books?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about all unschoolers, but I use coloring books.  I love<br/>\nto color.  I love the feel of crayons and the smell of crayons.  I<br/>\nlove the feel of the somewhat rough coloring pages and the way the<br/>\ncrayon reacts to different paper textures.  Somewhere in my life I got<br/>\n&quot;too old&quot; for coloring.  I&#39;m not sure if it was something that my<br/>\nmother said, society said, or just the feeling that other kids might<br/>\nlook at me oddly if I was coloring with crayons.  My son, otoh, could<br/>\nreally care less about coloring books.  He would much prefer to have a<br/>\nsheet of paper from the recycling pile and color his own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17287,"nextTopicId":17278}}
