Plus Summerhill. So I have a while until I fully \r<br/>\nunderstand &quot;unschooling&quot;. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nRight now I let my children have 30 mins of TV a day and 30 mins \r<br/>\ncomputer a day per child. (30mins TV total and 30 mins per child.)\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI would LOVE to let them go and give them total freedom to do as \r<br/>\nthey please, but I know it would be TV all day for one and Computer \r<br/>\nall day for the other and the babies would go between the two all \r<br/>\nday. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI know that pure unschooling would be to allow my child access to TV \r<br/>\nand computer all day long. BUT, for my sanity could anyone come up \r<br/>\nwith any benefits of watching TV? \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAlso, any unschooling tips on how to get my 10 yo to loose weight \r<br/>\nwithout being too controlling about it? Doctors orders and she&#39;s \r<br/>\nonly gained weight, even though she has tried to loose. \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10216,"nextTopicId":10237}}
