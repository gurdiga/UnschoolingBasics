I&#39;ve been thinking about it for the last few weeks <br/>\nso I thought I&#39;d share the little *me* moments I realized I take and <br/>\nthe *us* moments that happen all the time (since I have a *me* moment <br/>\nright now in which to do so).<br/>\n<br/>\nI work full time and my husband is a fabulous, baby-wearing SAHD. We <br/>\nhave 2 sons, 4 years and 18 mos. I think I was alone in my house once <br/>\nin 2007 and DH and I went to a movie once after DS1 was born. Between <br/>\nboth boys I have been pumping and breastfeeding for 4 years. We play <br/>\nall night until the boys are asleep around 10 or 11 and then DS2 is <br/>\nan avid night nurser. So, we are tired and a little crazy, but we <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have it any other way. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn bed at night, each time DS2 stops nursing and falls asleep, I roll <br/>\nover on my right side and I have about 5 minutes of *me* time before <br/>\nI pass out. Sometimes on Saturday morning DS2 gets up and goes out to <br/>\nwatch cartoons with DH and DS1. I have maybe 15-30 minutes when I am <br/>\nalone in my bed, no one is touching my breasts and I am not <br/>\nresponsible for anyone or anything. It&#39;s lovely Sometimes I try to <br/>\ndisappear into the bathroom with a book or get a shower started. I <br/>\nmight get 5 minutes or so before the boys find me and pile in. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I am thinking about all this during the last couple of weeks <br/>\nafter reading this post, and as much as I love those indulgent <br/>\nmoments, I realized that they aren&#39;t really what makes me a better <br/>\nmom. It&#39;s the *us* moments when DS1 crawls in bed with us and we are <br/>\nall snuggled up together, and when I am in the shower with the boys <br/>\nand they are hogging all the water, when I wrap them in their towels <br/>\nand we look at ourselves all happy in the mirror, the huge smiles <br/>\nwhen they pick me up from work- they are so happy to see me, etc, <br/>\netc, etc. Those moments are absolutely refreshing and make me feel <br/>\nlike I could go on like this for 100 years!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for making me think about this!  <br/>\nLeslie <br/>\n <br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Pamela Sorooshian <br/>\n&lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Apr 25, 2008, at 7:29 AM, alohabun wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; That is exactly how I feel about &quot;me time&quot; too.

We thought what we were doing was working, and it pretty <br/>\nmuch was<br/>\nuntil they decided they wanted to decide for themselves, then bedtimes <br/>\nbecame<br/>\nvery intense and unpleasant.  Giving up control has allowed it to be <br/>\npeaceful<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nRight---a peaceful late night is better than a stressful early <br/>\none---especially when it ends up about the same amount of time!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n   The first while we did this we didn&#39;t just start saying yes more <br/>\n(which is<br/>\nwhat the wise ones recommend), we threw out all rules and restrictions <br/>\nand as a<br/>\nresult there was *huge* party time around here for awhile with bedtimes <br/>\nbetween<br/>\nmidnight and 1 for our 3 year old twins.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nRight---just take it one night at a time and don&#39;t rush it.

We have an evening routine now that works <br/>\nfor us,<br/>\nand the girls let us know when they&#39;re tired, which is usually around <br/>\n10.  What<br/>\nI love is that they don&#39;t have to push through and pretend they&#39;re <br/>\n*not* tired<br/>\njust to stay up later than they would be &#39;allowed&#39; to if we had rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nRight.

It <br/>\nusually takes me a couple weeks to adjust - the first week is mostly <br/>\nspent wondering if she&#39;s actually shifted again or is it just a <br/>\ncouple days out-of-kilter? and more recently this has become <br/>\ncomplicated by *my* need to go to bed so that I can get up for work. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo&#39;s also not the sort of kid who &quot;settles down&quot; to sleep.

Being so new to this,<br/>\nI&#39;m having a hard time seeing which of my &quot;routines&quot; are being controlling,<br/>\nand which are helpful.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  I forget how olds the original poster&#39;s kids are - our twin girls are 3 1/2.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Our &#39;routine&#39; is pretty loose, but the framework is there nonetheless.  Mostly the evening is hanging out/playing/watching a movie/snacking (they often specifically ask to watch &quot;hap a moobie&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  I keep snacks out and available (just a continuation of the monkey trays we have going most of the day) which lessens the chance of them asking for food once they get into bed.  When we threw all rules and control out the window we had about a month of them saying &quot;I need something&quot; after they were all tucked in...and asking about 12 times before they finally stayed in bed.  Now that doesn&#39;t happen, and I suspect it&#39;s because they know they can have whatever they want whenever they want, so they&#39;re completely relaxed about it.  On occasion one of them has asked for something when they can barely keep their eyes open and I&#39;ve asked if it can wait until morning, and usually the answer is yes.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  We shut the house down as if we are all going to bed, this has been a big one for us.  We have little lights around the top of the ceiling in the living room (xmas lights) that we turn on that leave just enough light to see but not enough for it to be stimulating.  All the other lights are off except the bathroom night lights and their lamp and night light in their bedroom.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  They had lots of say recently in picking out their bed, picking out sheets for it, choosing where in their rooms they want it to be, etc., which I think really helps them enjoy their bedroom and being in bed.  They chose a bed they had room to sleep in together.  I make suggestions when I see them rubbing their eyes or looking really tired that we snuggle in bed with some books.  Most times they think that&#39;s a good idea, and sometimes they choose to watch a little of their favourite something that&#39;s been recorded and then we crawl in.  Dh or I lie down with them and they&#39;re usually out in under 5 minutes.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I suggest a bath earlier in the evening because I know they love playing in the tub.  Every second/third night they say yes, sometimes alone, sometimes together.  I just hand them their toothbrushes with toothpaste on them in the tub and they brush.  I suggest teeth brushing every morning/every evening and sometimes they go for it and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  On occasion one will want to sleep in our bed and the answer is always yes, then we just move them into their own bed after they fall asleep.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just know that once you relax rules and control it will perhaps look a little chaotic, but once they trust they will get their needs met and what they want is important to you they will relax into that.  At least mine did.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope some of that helps.  Again, this is what worked for *our* family, and none of it may apply to you.

If I&#39;m traveling that week, I get home<br/>\non Thurs and am up &#39;til at least midnight, DS usually stays up w/ me, and<br/>\naround 11pm I&#39;m done w/ chores/playing and ready to wind down.  I&#39;ll plop in<br/>\nfront of the TiVo to watch motorcycle racing from the past few days, and he<br/>\ncuddles up with me.  Sometimes he watches with me, other times we also read<br/>\na book or he watches one of his movies on his little media player.<br/>\n<br/>\nFri, Sat, and Sun nights vary.  I&#39;m often a night-owl (up &#39;til 1 or 2 am),<br/>\nand often DS will go to bed with his mom, but then get up later and come<br/>\nhang out with me for a bit.  And I&#39;m the first one out of bed in the morning<br/>\n95% of the time (by 7am or so), followed by DS about an hour later.  Then<br/>\nwe&#39;ll get some breakfast going, and DW gets up last.  On days when I&#39;m out<br/>\nof town, DS is up first about 70% of the time, and he&#39;ll play for a while<br/>\n(with the dog, or whatever) before waking up his mom (usually with caresses,<br/>\nbut sometimes by jumping on the bed) saying &quot;Sun up.  Mommy wake up.  Boy<br/>\nwant eat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNap times vary.  DS will sometimes fall asleep in odd positions like leaning<br/>\non the couch playing with a toy.  A few weeks ago we were all in the<br/>\nkitchen.  He was sitting on a bar stool eating something, eyes heavy, and<br/>\nsuddenly I noticed that he was completely asleep, sitting up, balanced on<br/>\nthe stool.  I took a picture, then carried him to the couch and he never<br/>\nstirred.  I like a mid-day nap, as does DW, so he&#39;ll sometimes nap with one<br/>\nof us.  He almost always falls asleep in the carseat, so even if it was for<br/>\nonly 10 minutes he usually won&#39;t nap later that day after a carseat nap<br/>\nduring errands.  And if we&#39;ve stayed home that day, he&#39;ll either nap for<br/>\n30-45 mins sometime between 3-6pm, OR he just falls asleep in the living<br/>\nroom (often on the couch) 9pm (if no nap that day) and we carry him to bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always trusted DS to sleep when he wants, since birth.  He nursed to<br/>\nsleep almost exclusively &#39;til he was nearly 3, whether for nap or nighttime.<br/>\nI can remember only a few times when DS wanted to stay up later than mom and<br/>\ndad.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has the occasional &quot;cranky&quot; morning due to inadequate sleep, but it&#39;s<br/>\npretty rare, plus it&#39;s self-resolving.  If he stayed up too late with me,<br/>\nand got up too early, he&#39;ll usually nap before lunch and then be rested and<br/>\nfine after that.  If we&#39;re up with an alarm clock (usually only one day a<br/>\nweek) because of a planned activity, it usually involves a car trip so he<br/>\njust sleeps in the car.  Sleep is pretty much a non-issue in our house--just<br/>\nsomething we do, like eating, when we want.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nBrad in Boulder, CO<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://holcombs.org\">http://holcombs.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Limits and bedtimes...","postDate":"1209051844","msgId":32100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4OTc2OC4xMDg0MC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2MDE0Mi44NzA1OC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32099,"nextInTopic":32102,"prevInTime":32099,"nextInTime":32101,"topicId":32073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wanted to add the I have just a little table lamp on so lights are dimmed out in the room I am in.

I can remember being resentful of how little time we were going to get together, David and I, given that I was stuck in bed with Simon waiting for him to fall asleep. I used to do kegel exercises to stay awake and worked on learning how to wink my left eye which I couldn&#39;t do. But half the time I&#39;d fall asleep anyhow and it made me furious when I&#39;d wake up  and discovered that I&#39;d slept through all of &quot;my time&quot;. The concept of &quot;my time&quot; was an awful burden. It&#39;s like having a time limit on video game access, I had to have it, it was &quot;my time&quot;. The rest of my day was other people&#39;s but this little bit in the evening, all mine (rubbing hands and cackling). Once I got rid of the idea, once we started to relax about bedtimes, I had much less need to have some sort of time all my own. I can see other things as<br/>\n being part of my time. Sitting and knitting, chatting to David while we cook together, having that 20 minutes in the morning before everyone else is out of bed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt also got rid of the them versus me mentality, or at least helped to get rid of it more. I don&#39;t see a &quot;my time&quot; versus &quot;their time&quot; dichotomy so much anymore. There are some mornings when I miss my 20 minutes where I have to reframe my vision of how my morning was going to go, but that is usually the worst that it gets. Sometimes now they stay up later than I do. The only constraint is not waking other people. If they get too loud they need to go to bed, or figure out something else that they can do quietly. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333194003,"authorName":"Kim Musolff","from":"&quot;Kim Musolff&quot; &lt;kmoose75@...&gt;","profile":"little_minds_preschool","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Limits and bedtimes...","postDate":"1209029157","msgId":32094,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA0MjQwMjI1ajY1OWJiMjNjcDQzYmUzMmE5ZDFlYjc1YTNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDI5NDE5Mi4yNzYzNC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGZ1b2Jkcis2cmtjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDI5NDE5Mi4yNzYzNC5xbUB3ZWI1NDEwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":32093,"nextInTopic":32096,"prevInTime":32093,"nextInTime":32095,"topicId":32073,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***We have an evening routine now that works for us, and the girls let us know when they re tired, which is usually around 10. *** I m curious what sort of","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1235899018\">***We have an evening routine now that works for us, and the girls let us<br/>\nknow when they&#39;re tired, which is usually around 10. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious what sort of  bedtime routine you have.

It wasn&#39;t until about 2 that I felt the need to enforce a<br/>\nbedtime, because I needed my own time to unwind.  But when they were babies,<br/>\nI actually loved the special late family times together.

When my kids were very little - babies and toddlers - there was<br/>\nnever a bedtime.  The kids went to bed when they were tired, via nursing to<br/>\nsleep.  And then, when they were around 3ish, bedtime reared its controlling<br/>\nhead.  I&#39;m guessing that by that time of their lives (particularly my first<br/>\nson, who has Autism and took mucho energy!), I was tired and worn out<br/>\n(mostly my fault, though I&#39;d never have admitted it!) and decided that damn<br/>\nit, I needed MY time back.  So bedtime became a Big Deal, and the fighting,<br/>\ncrying, whining, threatening, punishing phase began in our household.  Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI re-read John Holt in December and was reminded how beautiful and *right*<br/>\nthe unschooling lifestyle was for me.  We started moving in that direction<br/>\nand are still slowly saying &quot;yes&quot; more and giving more and more control back<br/>\nto the kids (where it belongs!).  For several months I was still wound up<br/>\npretty tightly over nighttime.  The official bedtime was gone, which made<br/>\nthe kids thrilled, but I was still resentful of MY time being sucked away.<br/>\nI honestly don&#39;t know how it happened, but after reading your post, I<br/>\nrealized that my resentment is gone.  Totally gone.  I still get tired at<br/>\nnight, and if loud exuberant play is happening late (for me that would be<br/>\n10ish), I definitely request that we all get settled down and redirect<br/>\npeople to quieter pursuits.  But there&#39;s no more massive stress or upset for<br/>\nme.  My 8yo son is often up to midnight, quietly playing on the computer or<br/>\nDS in his room.  We often don&#39;t even know he&#39;s still up he&#39;s so quiet!  My<br/>\n4yo son usually crashes out around 10-11, with gentle help from us (i.e. not<br/>\ntelling him to go to bed, but when he is acting tired, suggesting bed and<br/>\nhelping him go that direction if he feels he is ready).<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a strange concept at first, and it feels strange for a while.  But<br/>\neveryone I hear from on this subject says the same; those feelings of<br/>\nawkwardness go away, replaced with peace and relief that the bedtime battles<br/>\nare over for good!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell & Da Boys<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew, 8.5 and Josh, 4.5<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.thedaker.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you <br/>\nlove, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot; John Irving<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of julie<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, April 23, 2008 2:58 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Limits and bedtimes...<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am relatively new to the unschooling thought process.. and through <br/>\nthis group, have started reading Unconditional Parenting, I see that <br/>\nmany of what is said in this conversation is of value to me.... <br/>\n<br/>\nBut a specific question.... how do I get my 4 year old to go to sleep? <br/>\nIf I don&#39;t threaten, and I don&#39;t take away the music and the lights, <br/>\netc. How can I get her to go to bed?

Warning: you might not love what you read on first read - I didn&#39;t!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  There are lots of things you can do to &#39;set the mood&#39;, as in shut down the house as if everyone is going to bed, which really helped us make the transition, but every kid is so different, and it&#39;s about giving them the freedom to learn when they&#39;re tired, and taking the power struggle out of going to bed/sleep.  We thought what we were doing was working, and it pretty much was until they decided they wanted to decide for themselves, then bedtimes became very intense and unpleasant.  Giving up control has allowed it to be peaceful again.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The first while we did this we didn&#39;t just start saying yes more (which is what the wise ones recommend), we threw out all rules and restrictions and as a result there was *huge* party time around here for awhile with bedtimes between midnight and 1 for our 3 year old twins.  Now that month forced me to grow!!!  And then they settled out.  We have an evening routine now that works for us, and the girls let us know when they&#39;re tired, which is usually around 10.  What I love is that they don&#39;t have to push through and pretend they&#39;re *not* tired just to stay up later than they would be &#39;allowed&#39; to if we had rules.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, when I honour what they&#39;re telling me, allowing them to go to sleep when their little bodies are tired and not some preordained time so I can get &#39;my time&#39;, the &#39;my time&#39; just sort of magically happens.  It&#39;s like the time available to me expands or something, weird, but real.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I hope this helps a little, and I really encourage you to peruse the archives!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
