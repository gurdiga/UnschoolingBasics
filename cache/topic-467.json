But recently my 3.5 year old has become a real <br/>\nchallange.  If something doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants it to he has <br/>\nfull blown tantrums.  Now I have seen this in other children, but <br/>\nnever in mine.  And do try to let him do the things he wants to do, <br/>\nbut here is an example of a time when he just can&#39;t do what he <br/>\nwants.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is 4.5. Here&#39;s what I do (and have done for a long time) when it is<br/>\ngenuinely important that she do as I have asked her to - like ride in her<br/>\ncar seat, although we have never had that specific problem. I wait. Very<br/>\nquietly and let her say &quot;no&quot; as many times as she needs to. Sometimes I<br/>\nvalidate her feelings - &quot;you sure don&#39;t want to ....&quot; and I say &quot;Let me know<br/>\nwhen you are ready&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a few minutes, that can actually *seem* very long to me, she will take<br/>\na deep breath and say, &quot;OK I guess I can ....&quot; Then she cheerfully, or even<br/>\ngiggling, does whatever it was. I always remember to thank her and give her<br/>\na hug. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning to wait as long as needed was hard, and I&#39;m sure with a witness the<br/>\npause would be even harder. Like playing Chutes and Ladders or deschooling -<br/>\nif you say anything to hurry the process - back you go to the beginning.<br/>\nGetting dh not to interfere or try to jolly her along has been the biggest<br/>\nhurdle!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;He told me to put the carseat in the driver&#39;s seat.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got to admit that is pretty ingenious! When Jayn wants to &quot;drive&quot;, I<br/>\nlet her sit in the driver&#39;s seat with the car off and I sit next to her and<br/>\nshe makes all the noises. If you did that in your situation the other little<br/>\nboy would probably need a turn too! Sometimes following Jayn&#39;s lead with the<br/>\nlittle fantasy can be a great way to defuse the incipient meltdown (a word I<br/>\nprefer to &quot;tantrum&quot; which is so negative) EG: Wow we could but what about<br/>\nyour feet? And where would I sit? Maybe we should put the car seat on the<br/>\nroof. What about that idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Then he started screaming at me *Mom, shut up. <br/>\nMom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed, with my bewildered <br/>\nparents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him and backed out of <br/>\nthe driveway with him screaming the whole way.  About five minutes <br/>\ninto the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom anymore.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the spirit of finding something good in this - be joyful that he knew he<br/>\ncould say this and you *would* still be his Mom. He could say something this<br/>\npowerful and unpleasant secure in the knowledge that you still love him.<br/>\nSometimes Jayn is frustrated to the point of saying something like this. I<br/>\nusually let it pass, because I am trying to get back to the source of the<br/>\nupset, and this is just like noise or detritus. If you react to it, then it<br/>\nbecomes scary - for the child I mean. There are children in this world who<br/>\nare afraid of their parents - they wouldn&#39;t ever say this in case it came<br/>\ntrue in some way.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I pulled the car over, got out, opened <br/>\nhis door and got very close to his face.  I told him that he could <br/>\nnot continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my feelings, and <br/>\nthen I did a bad thing.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Jayn gets in my face and will scream - one good loud shriek is<br/>\ngenerally enough to let out her tension. I always feel bad that I let her<br/>\nfrustration with me get to that point. However it is very unpleasant to have<br/>\nsomeone right in your face like that. Sometimes my dh has done it to me - it<br/>\nis extremely intimidating. I have said sternly to Jayn, &quot;You may not scream<br/>\nat me&quot; but I DON&#39;T recommend that at all, and it is usually because *I* have<br/>\nlost my temper momentarily. It just makes her feel worse also. I try to hug<br/>\nher instead at those moments. If screaming in the car is making it hard to<br/>\ndrive, I have pulled over - when I usually just wait quietly, similarly to<br/>\nabove, until the storm has passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we had a discussion <br/>\nabout not telling each other to shut up because it is a mean thing to <br/>\nsay.  My eleven year old was involved in this and told me that he <br/>\nunderstood now why I didn&#39;t like it when he said this to his little <br/>\nbrother.  He even apoligized to Little bro for having said it to him <br/>\nin the past and made a pact to stop.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds really sweet, although I hope your 11yo doesn&#39;t feel bad if he<br/>\naccidentally breaks the pact in the heat of some moment. I usually wait a<br/>\nlittle while to talk about hurt feelings. Sometimes Jayn will suddenly say,<br/>\n&quot;Are you sorry you hurt my feelings?&quot; and we have to dig around to find out<br/>\nwhen it happened. Usually we apologize to each other shortly after whatever<br/>\nblow up occurred. It seems to give her a great sense of power and esteem to<br/>\nhave me apologize to her.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;How should I handle these <br/>\noutbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in the last couple <br/>\nof months. Is this just a stage?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it can be coming from a developmental stage, but it is still real in<br/>\nthe moment. I mean dismissing his anger as *merely* a stage, especially to<br/>\nhim or in his hearing, could make the stage last a lifetime. OTOH,<br/>\nremembering that it will pass and he will learn to become more reasonable<br/>\n(from an adult POV) may help you to keep calm and take deep breaths. My main<br/>\nsuggestion is not to take it personally, but yes to look for your<br/>\nresponsibility in causing the upset. Are you putting his needs aside for<br/>\nhousehold duties, or email checking (my usual bad)? Are you not noticing<br/>\nquickly enough when he needs some extra moments? Is there some other kind of<br/>\nbroader change or upheaval going on in his life that is making him feel<br/>\npowerless? You mention that your Mom is &quot;now&quot; caring for your nephew -<br/>\nperhaps that is one of the life changes that is causing imbalance for a<br/>\nwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some lovely essays at www.naturalchild.org including one entitled<br/>\nsomething like &quot;Helping children heal from emotional hurts&quot; that is just<br/>\nwonderful - talks about the power of silent listening. The whole site is<br/>\nwonderful - and it has short readable chunks that are more digestible for<br/>\nthe uninitiated than being given a whole book to read at first. Book<br/>\nrecommendations are there also of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

On the way to pick him up I bought milk and<br/>\n&gt; some other <br/>\n&gt; groceries that needed to get in the fridge before<br/>\n&gt; they spoiled.  When <br/>\n&gt; I took him to the car he told me that he wanted to<br/>\n&gt; sit on my lap.  I <br/>\n&gt; explained that he needed to be in his carseat in<br/>\n&gt; order to be safe and <br/>\n&gt; so that we wouldn&#39;t get a ticket from the policeman.<br/>\n&gt;  He told me to <br/>\n&gt; put the carseat in the driver&#39;s seat.  Well, I tried<br/>\n&gt; to tell him that <br/>\n&gt; that wouldn&#39;t work as I put him in his deat in the<br/>\n&gt; back.  He started <br/>\n&gt; to sruggle and fight.  He stiffened his body out<br/>\n&gt; straight so that I <br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t put the straps on him, but I managed to get<br/>\n&gt; him in and <br/>\n&gt; everything fastened.  Then he started screaming at<br/>\n&gt; me *Mom, shut up. <br/>\n&gt; Mom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed,<br/>\n&gt; with my bewildered <br/>\n&gt; parents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him<br/>\n&gt; and backed out of <br/>\n&gt; the driveway with him screaming the whole way. <br/>\n&gt; About five minutes <br/>\n&gt; into the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom<br/>\n&gt; anymore.  At that <br/>\n&gt; point my head was pounding.  I pulled the car over,<br/>\n&gt; got out, opened <br/>\n&gt; his door and got very close to his face.  I told him<br/>\n&gt; that he could <br/>\n&gt; not continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my<br/>\n&gt; feelings, and <br/>\n&gt; then I did a bad thing.  I told him that I was<br/>\n&gt; taking his brother to <br/>\n&gt; McDonalds and that I didn&#39;t want to buy anything for<br/>\n&gt; him.  That <br/>\n&gt; seemed to get his attention, he wanted something,<br/>\n&gt; too.  Now I never <br/>\n&gt; intended to leave him out, but I told him that when<br/>\n&gt; he hurt my <br/>\n&gt; feelings like that it made me not want to buy him<br/>\n&gt; something.  Please <br/>\n&gt; understand that he had already eaten dinner at my<br/>\n&gt; Mom&#39;s, I would <br/>\n&gt; never withhold food as a punishment.  But at least<br/>\n&gt; he stopped <br/>\n&gt; screaming.  I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we<br/>\n&gt; had a discussion <br/>\n&gt; about not telling each other to shut up because it<br/>\n&gt; is a mean thing to <br/>\n&gt; say.

And while I&#39;m glad he can<br/>\n&gt; put his feelings <br/>\n&gt; into words, it still feels violent.  How should I<br/>\n&gt; handle these <br/>\n&gt; outbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in<br/>\n&gt; the last couple <br/>\n&gt; of months. Is this just a stage?

He needed you and you decided milk was<br/>\nmore important than what he needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you&#39;d held him?  What if he was happy after ten minutes.  The<br/>\nmilk would have been ok.  What if he wanted you to hold him for forty<br/>\nminutes?   The milk might have still been ok, but what if it wasn&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you had to go by more milk?  The price of milk is not greater<br/>\nthan your sons comfort and happiness. <br/>\nSurely you&#39;ve &quot;wasted&quot; a few dollars on something that would brighten<br/>\nyour day, a new lipstick or nail polish or something.  Your son needed a<br/>\nmoment of brightness with you. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your other son was with you maybe he could have run the perishables in<br/>\nto your moms fridge until you were ready to go.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I told him that when he hurt my feelings like that it made me not want<br/>\nto buy him something. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you hurt his feelings by not being available to him he didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow what to do.

So here we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been reading sstuff about mindful parenting and have never been <br/>\na spanker.  But recently my 3.5 year old has become a real <br/>\nchallange.  If something doesn&#39;t happen the way he wants it to he has <br/>\nfull blown tantrums.  Now I have seen this in other children, but <br/>\nnever in mine.  And do try to let him do the things he wants to do, <br/>\nbut here is an example of a time when he just can&#39;t do what he <br/>\nwants.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Joel spent some time with my mom and my nephew who is also <br/>\n3.5.  On the way to pick him up I bought milk and some other <br/>\ngroceries that needed to get in the fridge before they spoiled.  When <br/>\nI took him to the car he told me that he wanted to sit on my lap.  I <br/>\nexplained that he needed to be in his carseat in order to be safe and <br/>\nso that we wouldn&#39;t get a ticket from the policeman.  He told me to <br/>\nput the carseat in the driver&#39;s seat.  Well, I tried to tell him that <br/>\nthat wouldn&#39;t work as I put him in his deat in the back.  He started <br/>\nto sruggle and fight.  He stiffened his body out straight so that I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t put the straps on him, but I managed to get him in and <br/>\neverything fastened.  Then he started screaming at me *Mom, shut up. <br/>\nMom, shut up.*  Over and over again he screamed, with my bewildered <br/>\nparents watching from the driveway.  I ignored him and backed out of <br/>\nthe driveway with him screaming the whole way.  About five minutes <br/>\ninto the drive he told me that I wasn&#39;t his Mom anymore.  At that <br/>\npoint my head was pounding.  I pulled the car over, got out, opened <br/>\nhis door and got very close to his face.  I told him that he could <br/>\nnot continue to talk to me that way, that he hurt my feelings, and <br/>\nthen I did a bad thing.  I told him that I was taking his brother to <br/>\nMcDonalds and that I didn&#39;t want to buy anything for him.  That <br/>\nseemed to get his attention, he wanted something, too.  Now I never <br/>\nintended to leave him out, but I told him that when he hurt my <br/>\nfeelings like that it made me not want to buy him something.  Please <br/>\nunderstand that he had already eaten dinner at my Mom&#39;s, I would <br/>\nnever withhold food as a punishment.  But at least he stopped <br/>\nscreaming.  I got back in the driver&#39;s seat and we had a discussion <br/>\nabout not telling each other to shut up because it is a mean thing to <br/>\nsay.  My eleven year old was involved in this and told me that he <br/>\nunderstood now why I didn&#39;t like it when he said this to his little <br/>\nbrother.  He even apoligized to Little bro for having said it to him <br/>\nin the past and made a pact to stop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was one outburst of anger, but they happen several times a day.  <br/>\nThey usually consist of Joel growling and saying, *I&#39;m so ANGRY with <br/>\nyou* over and over again.  And while I&#39;m glad he can put his feelings <br/>\ninto words, it still feels violent.  How should I handle these <br/>\noutbursts of anger.  This is a new thing for him in the last couple <br/>\nof months. Is this just a stage?  Any help or advice will be <br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":461,"nextTopicId":537}}
