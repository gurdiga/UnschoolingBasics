However, the cool thing is just a couple of days ago I was talking to a great friend about what was going on in my &#39;head&#39; -- from where I should be working to if I should homeschool/unschool my soon to be 5 child..   And even though she was not opposed to homeschooling I just couldn&#39;t get her to see the big picture of unschooling. So, I just didn&#39;t really try -- because most people don&#39;t understand and/or agree with it unless their doing it...  But it left me kind of doubtful myself... THEN I read this post!! thank you , thank you , thank you.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  --------------------------<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now to another point and question.   I am an elementary education major and so far I have just been working at a daycare as their pre-school teacher /caregiver -- where I also take my kids.  This has been a great experience but in my last post I was struggling with the fact that I have some what of an unschooling philosophy and if I could fit it in to work.  Well with great suggestions from a few of you -- I realized I really can&#39;t but I could work in some strategies ..(and they have worked).  Then I have been struggling with -- how do I unschool my child yet work in the education system?  am I a hypocrit ?  on and on ... But I realized (again thanks to some other post and readings I&#39;ve done on this post ) that unschooling isn&#39;t for all and if I can help those students who are still in the school system then this is good.  But it is all right for me to do what is correct for my children.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Another thought I have noticed progress with my child being at a pre-school.  Even with the struggle we have being in the same class together (he just wants to be the teacher too , yet I have to make him follow what the other kids are doing/ follow the rules or not show &#39;favoritism) .  So that makes me think -- hmmm maybe schooling isn&#39;t so bad.  Plus, if I go to work at a school then Ian could go with me.. And he keeps saying when he gets big he&#39;s going to the ride the bus and go to school ....!!  I truly feel that it would be easiest to keep him home then to have him go and really have to work harder at the unschooling.  but here&#39;s the but --- what if he is a child that flourishes better in school???? <br/>\n   <br/>\n      <br/>\n    _._,___         <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTake the Internet to Go: Yahoo!Go puts the Internet in your pocket: mail, news, photos & more. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Are my kids just reacting to deschooling?
