Pass along to others who may be interested:<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings from the 2008 Unschooling Conference in Madison, Wisconsin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 2007 conference, the first unschooling conference ever in Wisconsin, was a huge success!  It was a very energizing and renewing experience.  Participants took full advantage of the small size of the conference and the intimate atmosphere to connect and have in-depth conversations with other conference attendees and presenters.  Feedback was very enthusiastic, and many people asked for another conference in 2008, so here we go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2008 Unschooling Conference, January 12, will feature a keynote address by Manish Jain of Shikshantar: The Peoplesâ Institute for Rethinking Development and Education, in Udaipur, India. We are looking forward to another exciting and fulfilling day of connecting with unschoolers, and expanding our unschooling horizons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more information and to download a registration form, please visit our website:   www.unschoolingconference.com.  We look forward to seeing everyone in January!<br/>\n<br/>\nTanya Cunningham<br/>\nThe Unschooling Conference<br/>\nwww.unschoolingconference.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better pen pal.
