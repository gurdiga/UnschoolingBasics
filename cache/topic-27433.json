There&#39;s a dangerous trap to fall into in that we can never, ever <br/>\nguarantee another person&#39;s happiness. As parents, if we get caught <br/>\nup in the idea that we are *responsible* for our kids&#39; happiness, we <br/>\ncan begin to devalue the rest of our children&#39;s emotions. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids need to know its Okay to be sad, angry, frustrated, bored, <br/>\nscared, uncertain.... These are all real human emotions they will <br/>\nfeel at one time or other in their lives. That&#39;s not to say that <br/>\nproblem solving isn&#39;t important! But not every problem is fixable in <br/>\nthe moment. Not every solution works the way we would like it to. So <br/>\nwe parents need to be open to the less happy emotions, and help our <br/>\nchildren process them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you see how many levels I feel like I&#39;ve been failing on here? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see that you&#39;ve &quot;failed&quot; anything at all, personally. Your <br/>\nson has made an attempt to communicate and you are attempting to <br/>\nunderstand and figure out what to do. TADA! That&#39;s a success in my <br/>\nbook.
