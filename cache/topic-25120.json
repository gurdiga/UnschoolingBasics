One day I walked into the girl&#39;s restroom to<br/>\nfind one of the most popular (and thinest) girls in school crying at<br/>\nthe sink. I was really startled so I asked her what was wrong and<br/>\nthrough big crocodile tears she related how she ate and ate and tried<br/>\nto gain weight but she couldn&#39;t and she was tired of being so skinny<br/>\nand she had to shop in the junior section rather than the women&#39;s,<br/>\netc. She was very upset!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was *stunned* because she&#39;d always seemed so cool and collected and<br/>\nappeared to have the perfect life.

I have no idea why she felt okay sharing all of that with me<br/>\nsince we weren&#39;t friends, but I&#39;m glad I was able to be there to<br/>\nlisten to her and provide empathy.

We all understand that the modeling industry prefers thin women but the part we seem to like is the artistic nature of the finished photos. A lot of the girls on that show are not particularly attractive at all, but the finished photos are very often quite beautiful, and some of the girls are very good at invoking different moods and looking completely different from photo to photo. Other girls cannot do it, and despite their beauty, they look the same in every photo. There is actually more to modeling than getting your picture taken, not that I am a huge fan of the industry. But the modeling industry is just one aspect of our culture that potentially degrades women. One thing no one has mentioned is the emphasis on height. We complain about that more than the thinness.

Thank you, Ren! <br/>\n <br/>\nI worry about desensitizing of our kids, all that stuff, but yes, that&#39;s  <br/>\ntrue, pretty much I feel. We mothers (parents!) have a serious job...and I try  <br/>\nto be open about my recovery and the effects and affects ;) It&#39;s tough. On July <br/>\n 27, I will have 7 inactive years :) :) :) And I&#39;m not shy about celebrating  <br/>\nthat! I am imperfect, I am human, and I&#39;m ok. (lol, &quot;I&#39;m good enough, I&#39;m <br/>\nsmart  enough, and gosh darn it, people like me!&quot; lol...good ole Jack Handy) And  <br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to promote that, though of course I still have battles. I try to <br/>\nkeep  them on the inside, but if they become hard to cope with, they do tend to <br/>\nseep  out. I try, I&#39;m honest, I love freely. I figure that&#39;s the best way to <br/>\ncope with  this. My mother was always insecure. No ED at all, but that <br/>\ninsecurity, and  knowing who she looked to as role models (Mary Tyler Moore, a very, <br/>\nvery slender  woman, for one), I think really did get me in some ways. But I&#39;d <br/>\nbe lying to say  that media did NOT do the same. I still am unsure of the <br/>\ndegree of that however  - it&#39;s all a-jumble now in many ways. I was &quot;odd&quot; as it <br/>\ndidn&#39;t appear until  after my first 3 kids came and I was an adult. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, enough babble! thanks for the kind words, Ren. I am doing all I can  <br/>\nto just go with the flow, think and speak critically, and stay healthy. I have <br/>\n too much going on not to! and..too much self respect :)<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:Karen/Top Model","postDate":"1185234081","msgId":25123,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY4M2ViMSs1c2c2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGM4YS5lMmU0YmIzLjMzZDY4ZTkwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":25121,"nextInTopic":25125,"prevInTime":25122,"nextInTime":25124,"topicId":25120,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I worry that my lovely 15 year old might see herself as needing to be thinner, see that as the ideal for womanhood, that kind of stuff.~~ I believe the way","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1321183869\">~~I worry that my lovely 15 year old might see herself as needing to<br/>\nbe thinner, see that as the &quot;ideal&quot; for womanhood, that kind of stuff.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the way young girls see themselves has more to do with their<br/>\nmothers self-image than anything.
