Diet intervention has<br/>\nbeen paramount in his recovery. He started with a moderate autism diagnosis<br/>\nand is now borderline just 3 years later. We have a lot of evidence that he<br/>\nwas harmed by vaccinations, antibiotics, and some food allergies. He had a<br/>\nmyriad of physical/behavioral symptoms that are no longer present after<br/>\nremoving allergens and focusing on his health (ie nutrient dense food!!). I<br/>\nchose to focus on my child for who he is AND focus on recovery from the<br/>\nsymptoms of autism.. For instance before cutting out casein from his diet he<br/>\nhad no language and would bump into walls. He would stim for hours and<br/>\ntantrum. Then we took it out and after a month his vocabulary jumped to 50<br/>\nwords and he no longer bumped into walls! He started showing who he really<br/>\nwas inside..a very social happy boy. He also had horrible painful loose<br/>\nstools...we changed his diet and those went away.

One<br/>\nparticular meeting stands out.  I sat in this little sterile room,<br/>\nwhile the vice principal, his teacher at the time, and the school<br/>\npsychologist all discussed his behavior and his performance.  As they<br/>\nwent over the list, the psychologist was TRYING to fit him into a<br/>\ncategory.  Apparently, they knew SOMETHING was wrong with him, but<br/>\nthey just couldn&#39;t figure out what.  They couldn&#39;t even find a reason<br/>\nto order an evaluation.  All of his behaviors seemed to contradict<br/>\nother behaviors.  They NEVER saw him for who he was, they were do busy<br/>\ntrying to make him fit into who they THOUGHT he was.  (I suppose the<br/>\nmore &quot;disabled&quot; children they have the more grant money they get.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing ANY of those meetings ever helped with was hastening my<br/>\ndecision to homeschool and ultimately unschool.

I have always been against labeling unless the label gets the labeled person something -- better understanding for themseleves, different/better treatments, etc. Unfortunately I also think people use labels as a crutch to not see the individual and not take ownership for their part in a relationship -- whether that be parent, child, doctor, teacher, etc. Until now, I was always focused on what labeling did/does to me. Now that I have a son, I can be quite the fierce momma bear when someone tries to label him -- even if the labels a &quot;good&quot; labels. I&#39;m really big on saying &quot;it isnt good or bad it just is&quot; about lots of things in life and i really want that to apply to my ds too. So any advice on how to be gentler with others when they start trying to label him, but still get the point accross that I don&#39;t want them to do it?<br/>\np.s.
