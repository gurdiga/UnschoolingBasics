Yes, <br/>\nit&#39;s silly,  but I&#39;m really wondering. It seems like most people I <br/>\nknow who have dogs  keep them in cages a lot of the time. And my <br/>\nneighbor got a puppy and  worked hard to get him on a schedule, which <br/>\nis so, ya know, un-AP!  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\nIt&#39;s best not anthropomorphize the dogs. They are dogs, not children. They  <br/>\nare den animals and prefer a &#39;covered&#39; place of their own---something  <br/>\n&#39;den-like&#39;. Crates fit the bill.<br/>\n <br/>\nMost people don&#39;t know much about dogs. They don&#39;t understand  <br/>\nage-appropriate or instinctive or breed-specific behaviors. They  act as if they are <br/>\nchildren. They aren&#39;t.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy dogs love their crates. Ryan will have his in the car (like a safety  belt <br/>\nfor dogs) and in the hotel room. You&#39;re welcome to witness it! &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;ll <br/>\nall nap in their crates with the doors open. It&#39;s a safe  place---and should <br/>\nALWAYS be treated as such. Flying on airplanes is *easy* when  the dog is <br/>\ncrate-trained. Often traumatic when not. Visiting friends and famiily  who aren&#39;t <br/>\ndog-friendly is also easier.<br/>\n <br/>\nScheduling the puppy is not so much for the puppy&#39;s sake (other than to  <br/>\navoid human wrath), as for the human&#39;s. Potty training is easier when you know  <br/>\nwhen he&#39;ll have to pee or poop----scoot him outside as soon as you can. He  <br/>\nlearns where to &#39;go&#39; and can get praised for it. Praise for going outside  is <br/>\nperferable to pissing you off for going inside---and being on the receiving  end <br/>\nof a &#39;white-carpet-rant&#39;. It&#39;s also using a natural tendency to not soil  where <br/>\nhe sleeps-----he won&#39;t soil his crate, and so will naturally &quot;hold it&quot;  until <br/>\nhe&#39;s let out of the crate and directly into the yard.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe easiest way to train a dog is to use his natural tendencies/instincts  to <br/>\nour advantage. That&#39;s how we got herding dogs and hunting dogs----herding,  <br/>\npointing, retrieving are all &#39;parts&#39; of the natural hunting drive----watch  <br/>\nwolves hunt in a pack; they used all this communication to work together.  <br/>\nTerriers instinctively dig and hunt. Hounds use their noses or eyes to trail and  <br/>\nhunt. Humans have just made the best of them by honing them to our needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor the most part, we&#39;ve left strict obedience behind in favor of  &quot;house <br/>\nmanners&quot;----more unschooly. &lt;g&gt; But still, we know what&#39;s  instinctive and how to <br/>\nwork WITH that, not against it.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2853,"nextTopicId":2860}}
