It&#39;s hard for us when it&#39;s violence they&#39;re playing -- we don&#39;t have any trouble with their playing at nurturing a doll or flying and airplane -- but I really believe they&#39;re just processing something new in their environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s actually treating anyone violently, that&#39;s a diffent issue though.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nIt&#39;s here!

It is fantasy and kids know it<br/>\nis fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a book called &quot;Killing Monsters&quot; by Gerard<br/>\nJones who argues that the fantasy is good for kids.
