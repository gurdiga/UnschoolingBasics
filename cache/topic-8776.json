I took a Dale Carnegie class over 10 years ago and that is<br/>\nthe most important and lasting piece of advice I culled from it. In<br/>\n_How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ the advice was<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Ask yourself what is the worst thing that can happen. (he even<br/>\ntakes it to far out extremes - like death)<br/>\n2. Prepare yourself for the worst/accept what you can not change<br/>\n3. Move on - usually the worst does not happen, so you are not doing too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me this usually means, something might get destroyed. Usually, it<br/>\nis not even anything I care about - so I can quickly redirect myself.<br/>\nMy big issue is when one child &quot;might&quot; hurt the other (from playing<br/>\naround and having fun) - but that is another post.<br/>\n<br/>\nStamps are actually pretty indestructible - but feelings and memories<br/>\nare not. Have you done foot print painting? Take a long piece of paper<br/>\nfrom an art roll and run it down the sidewalk. Let your kids dip their<br/>\nfeet in paint (use several colors so they can mix them up) and<br/>\ndance/tiptoe/slide down the walkway. My kids LOVE this ! It is all<br/>\nabout the process, although sometimes the end product is pretty cool<br/>\ntoo.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: discouraged","postDate":"1136515300","msgId":8776,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwa2xkNCtkbmVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8779,"prevInTime":8775,"nextInTime":8777,"topicId":8776,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Gayle, I haven t the time to read all the posts but I just wanted to share something that has helped me completely let go of control.
