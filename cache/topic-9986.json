My","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1890185331\">Ren, <br/>\nI never heard that story about you and your Mom&#39;s laundry. I&#39;m glad you wrote <br/>\nit, even if you have written it a lot before. I was a real nice story.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Mom died of cancer also, it was a pretty rare kind at the time. She had it <br/>\nfor 91/2 yrs., it returned each year, big tumors, worse than the year before <br/>\nand we watched the cancer take more and more of her each time. A very long and <br/>\nsad story. She was this tiny, soft spoken, petite thing, but inside, as I <br/>\nlearned more over time, she was a rock, the one who pretty much held our family <br/>\ntogether the most in hard times. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can soooo relate to you. We used to stay with her in the hospital around <br/>\nthe clock taking shifts between my Dad, my sister and me. One time I had been at <br/>\nmy in-laws home and half of my dh&#39;s family (not my dh, he&#39;s so darn easy <br/>\ngoing, not much gets to him) but most of the rest of the family that was there was <br/>\narguing about something stupid, don&#39;t even remember what it was. I was taking <br/>\nthe midnight shift at the time and not really having to leave that early, I <br/>\ndecided to any way. I got the heck out of there early to stay with her. When I <br/>\ngot there, I peeked into her room and there she was sitting there all alone <br/>\nstaring into space, (my sister had gone to get her something) when she looked up <br/>\nand saw me, her face lit up with this huge smile. I couldn&#39;t believe how <br/>\nsomeone so sick could be so happy and all of the people (family!) I had just left <br/>\nwere being so nasty to each other. I crawled beside her on the bed and we just <br/>\nlaid there and talked like we did every night. It was so peaceful there with <br/>\nher. Even in the middle of all that pain and suffering, she still had so much <br/>\nto give and did so happily and freely. There were many wonderful things that <br/>\nhappened like that with her that I really won&#39;t ever forget, being reminded of <br/>\nthose times is always such a comfort. You just reminded me of that time. All <br/>\nof this mess around here, the dog hair, kids messes, laundry, dishes <br/>\netc......is really not that bad of a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks and you can share your stories any time with me,<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\ncheck out my art at!<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.picturetrail.com/nancysart&quot;\">http://www.picturetrail.com/nancysart&quot;</a>&gt;PictureTrail&lt;/A&gt;  or <br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://carverscompanion.com/Ezine/Vol9Issue3/KMenendez/KMenendez2.html&quot;\">http://carverscompanion.com/Ezine/Vol9Issue3/KMenendez/KMenendez2.html&quot;</a>&gt;Woodcarver On-Line Magazine, Pyrography News, No. 34&lt;/A&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2346607,"authorName":"ohpurple1@aol.com","from":"ohpurple1@...","profile":"openmindedfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] chores, messes and madness","postDate":"1139965693","msgId":9996,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJlLjM3YjcwNDM1LjMxMjNkOGZkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9988,"nextInTopic":9999,"prevInTime":9995,"nextInTime":9997,"topicId":9986,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That was a beautiful.
