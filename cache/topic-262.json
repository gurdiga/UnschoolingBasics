Timing is EVERYTHING. This would not have gone so smoothly if dh had not been ready for a change.</font></p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></p> \n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">So here&#39;s what I did:</font></p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">Yesterday afternoon I did my homework, reading articles at Life Learning Magazine, Autonomous Child, Sandra Dodd.com and Taking Children Seriously, and I printed out a couple of articles that really spoke to me. Then I wrote a letter (I often approach big issues by writing because I am better able to organize my thoughts in writing). I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d actually give the letter to dh - sometimes I just use my letters as an outline for a verbal discussion. But in this case I gave him my letter (one page) and two articles (three more pages) to read when he got home from work. Let me point out here that it is dh&#39;s custom to read the mail or a magazine when he gets home, and I often print out interesting articles for him, so he was cool with me handing him some reading material. Here&#39;s an excerpt from the letter:</font></p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></p> \n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">&quot;We are people who have decided that traditional religion and traditional education does not work for our family. It is my opinion that traditional parenting (that is, parenting that involves yelling, spanking, guilt, threats, etc.) is not working for our family either. We have decided that we want to raise children who are true to themselves, who make their own decisions instead of following the crowd, who are strong and confident and tolerant and compassionate. I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re �walking the talk� on this. Our ideas and our actions are not in sync at all. </font></p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></p> \n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">I know you will agree that we are the main role models for our kids. And that you will agree that you don&#39;t like being an �angry Dad� just as I don&#39;t like being an �angry Mom.� </font><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">When we decided we didn&#39;t like traditional religion, we found an alternative that worked for us. When we decided that we didn&#39;t like traditional education, we found an alternative that worked for us. So, naturally it follows that if finding alternatives in the areas of religion and education has worked for us, and now we see that we&#39;re having problems in the area of<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>parenting, we should look for an alternative to the traditional way of parenting.&quot;</font></p>\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">&nbsp;</font></p> \n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size=\"2\">Here are links to the articles that accompanied my letter:<span style=\"COLOR:red;\"> </span></font></font></p> \n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-1041794891MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN:0in 0in 0pt;\"><span style=\"COLOR:red;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/read.html\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/read.html</font></a><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\"> </font></span><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"2\">Tracy Athens� article �Go Find Something To Do� in the March/April 2003 issue was my big AHA!
