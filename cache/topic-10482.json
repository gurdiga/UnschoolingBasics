I paused and we<br/>\ndiscussed his options again (getting detangler, and then combing daily), but<br/>\nhe still insisted he wanted a haircut. So, he now has short hair and is<br/>\nperfectly happy.

Don&#39;t worry about the homeschool/unschool part of it just yet. You all need time to heal from the year from hell. So bake some cookies, stay in your jammies, read, play games, watch movies or TV, talk, laugh, have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I have a Conor too. He&#39;s 16 now and hasn&#39;t had a year from hell since 1999. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the<br/>\ngreen earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly<br/>\nalive.&quot;<br/>\n                                   ~Thich Nhat Hanh<br/>\n<br/>\n -------------- Original message ----------------------<br/>\nFrom: &quot;jsnhawkins&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsnhawkins@...\">jsnhawkins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174249365,"authorName":"Saille","from":"Saille &lt;mkleblanc@...&gt;","profile":"mkleblanc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Hi!

My advice to you is to just relax and unwind for a while. Transitioning from a public school environment to unschooling can take a while. Don&#39;t let people make you feel guilty about not &quot;teaching&quot; your child. He will learn what he needs to learn when he needs to learn it. Just provide him with the plenty of resources and opportunities to experience the world, but allow him to guide his learning. Get involved in some recreational activities or join a homeschooling group. Maybe do some volunteer work together.  Try to remember that it is ok to just sit and veg sometimes. Some days my girls just sit in there room ALL day and listen to a book on tape. I take those times to do some I enjoy. Good luck to you on your new journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa in Eugene, OR<br/>\n<br/>\njsnhawkins &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsnhawkins@...\">jsnhawkins@...</a>&gt; wrote:     Just wanted to intoduce myself.
