My oldest in 10 and youngest 6.  my middle son needs his own space so we assigned hima &quot;private space&#39; . It was the closet of the bedroom.  He haslittle table there to retreat to where he keeps his legos.  He also retreats to his bed or a place under it.  If there too many people in the house he can come to my room as well.  I think some kids need more time alone and the nowledge that they can get away for a few minutes.

So a little sister is the last thing she wants at the end of her day. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a different situation, with just one child, so unless you have more, you won&#39;t have to worry about sibling issues. That&#39;s one of the advantages of just having one child! If he&#39;s not in school, he won&#39;t need time to decompress from school at the end of the day. Even if you do have more kids, the dynamics between home/unschooled siblings aren&#39;t exactly the same as those between schooled siblings, in part because they don&#39;t have the ongoing expectation of segregation by age. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was thinking that, maybe, children at home (not schooled) have a bigger need of space because they spend lots of time at home? Is that correct?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;ve seen - most of the home/unschoolers I know in person have little bitty houses. And unschoolers are often very good at handling issues while they&#39;re still small and adapting to changing situations. So with that in mind, you don&#39;t need to find a perfect solution for the day when (maybe) your son wants more space. You can look at him and see what he needs from day to day. If he&#39;s starting to want a little bit of space to himself, you work on that, changing as he changes. Maybe a blanket over a table will be enough to make him a little private space for awhile. Maybe you&#39;ll convert a closet into a tiny bedroom, or build a basic loft - like a tall bunk bed, but without the bottom bunk. Those can be built free-standing so you don&#39;t have to worry about tying into the walls of your flat. Maybe that would work for your sister-in-law&#39;s older daughter, for that matter - she can pull up the ladder and have privacy from the little sister. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I was also thinking that my sister in law was kind of complaining because the 4 years old girl is not leting ther sister be in calm and peace in her own room... but, the responsability of finding calm space at home, to everyone, belongs to the parents, not to the younger children... how can we do that?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way would be to plan to do something with the 4yo around the times her big sister needs some privacy. If she needs time right after school, that could be a good time to take the little one outside - to a park or a shop, maybe. Or it could help to put on a movie the 4yo likes - with headphones so the sound doesn&#39;t disturb big sister. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could also help to talk to the 10yo about giving her sister some attention as a kind of self-defense. If she comes home, for instance, and little sister is sooooooo excited to see her, it might be better to play with her for half an hour and Then go take a break - otherwise she&#39;s trying to rest and little sister is all wound up wanting her wonderful, special, favorite big sister ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I had the ideia that children like to hide and play.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some do, some don&#39;t. Ray liked to get into little bitty spaces when he was small, but Mo never did. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; my sun wants to be in is &quot;litle house&quot; but only if i&#39;m there too. It is too small for both<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nMake a bigger one! Hanging blankets - around your bed for instance - can give a cozy, tent-like feeling, and you can pull the fabric up out of the way later. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334892198,"authorName":"Ann","from":"&quot;Ann&quot; &lt;auntannies2002@...&gt;","profile":"auntannies2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: how much space?","postDate":"1331820501","msgId":48052,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpqc3Q0bCtnam0zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEUzMzM4OEM4ODQ1MjQ5QzY5RkEyRjdBQkFENkMwQjFBQFBJTlRPPg=="},"prevInTopic":48049,"nextInTopic":48061,"prevInTime":48051,"nextInTime":48053,"topicId":48047,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ll answer part of your question as to children wanting to play alone.
