Several times. How long should I hold that over his head? Out loud or just in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet go. Move on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why not get another TV and set up for gaming? Search this list for discussions on how cheaply that can be done. Why have the two men in the house squabbling over stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, btw, nothing will magically change in any sort of big way. Unschooling is a way of life and no one thing will make all of it click. It takes a long-term commitment to living better. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time you run up against a situation that is not going the way you want, Dad and DS fighting over TV time, for instance, don&#39;t look for anyone to blame, don&#39;t think about whether or not unschooling is &quot;working,&quot; think about how you can fix this little problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings like this are not necessarily signs of some deep-rooted problem. They are just today&#39;s inconvenience that can be dealt with in a practical, respectful, kind way.
