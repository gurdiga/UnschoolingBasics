The entire place is an elective. The paths <br/>\nare infinite and the results uncertain. College is something you <br/>\ncomplete. Life is something you experience. So donâ€™t worry about your <br/>\ngrade, or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, <br/>\nand you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Love what you do. Get good at it.
