She doesn&#39;t like the putting them back up part but will do it when she finds out that she won&#39;t get computer privileges or some other (dare I say it here &lt;BWG&gt;) punishment if she doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would she find that out?<br/>\n<br/>\nNobody likes the putting them back part. But I don&#39;t get punished for not filing stuff when I should. Even if it means I lose things or have a hard time finding them later. Which usually puts me in a frenzy of filing. :) (Office stuff is my personal concern here, not toys, as I have several different things going on that all generate too much paper.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur 21-month-old nephew does not get punished when his toys are, literally, all over the house. We pick them up. Mostly I pick them up. DH does when he&#39;s around and when he thinks of it. And the older kids help if I ask them to. Which I do when it gets too hectic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older kids each pick up their own rooms as much as they want -- DD is pretty tidy, DS is buried in there somewhere. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see why this --<br/>\n<br/>\nSo do I learn to walk over the mess or happily pick it up and if it is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; destroyed stop buying more cause frankly it is starting to cost a lot.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Loving Father<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- wasn&#39;t a perfectly good answer to start with.
