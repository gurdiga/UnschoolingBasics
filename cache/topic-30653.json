Long book list as well as elists, websites, and <br/>\nconferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several good books on the inanity and insanity of schools and <br/>\non<br/>\nthe marvels of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling &quot;patron saint&quot; is John Holt. He was a school reformer <br/>\nin the<br/>\n70&#39;s who came to realize that schools are NOT reformable. His most <br/>\npopular<br/>\nbooks are _How Children Fail_, _How Children Learn_, _Teach Your Own_, <br/>\nand _Learning<br/>\nAll the Time_.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Taylor Gatto was a NY city and NY state teacher of the year. He <br/>\nfinally<br/>\nquit and started on the speaking circuit. He seems completely behind<br/>\nunschooling (although a little anti-TV and -gaming). His two big books <br/>\nare _Dumbing Us Down_ and _The Underground<br/>\nHistory of American Education_.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank Smith has a great little book called _The Book of Learning and<br/>\nForgetting_ that shows how little one learns in and remembers from <br/>\nschool. He<br/>\npushes REAL learning---for a purpose. GREAT for dads!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfie Kohn&#39;s _Punished by Rewards_ shows the total inanity of EXtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation (gold stars, grades, etc.) and the attributes of INtrinsic<br/>\nmotivation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrace Llewellyn&#39;s _The Teenage Liberation Handbook (How to Quit School <br/>\nand<br/>\nGet a REAL Education)_ is the &quot;bible&quot; for unschoolers. It&#39;s a great <br/>\nread for<br/>\nteens, but parents should read it too. Be SURE not to skip the &quot;cute <br/>\nlittle<br/>\nstory&quot; at the beginning. Grace also hosts the &quot;Not Back To School Camp&quot; <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe early fall for teen unschoolers---a place to meet other unschoolers <br/>\nand share<br/>\npassions and interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Griffith has two books, _The Homeschooling Handbook_ and _The <br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\nHandbook_. The Homeschooling Handbook has many great ideas for <br/>\ndocumenting<br/>\nwhat&#39;s being learned; and, since that is a requirement in SC, it&#39;s very<br/>\nhelpful. But _The Unschooling Handbook_ is THE handbook for new <br/>\nunschoolers. In it she<br/>\ngives real life examples and explanations. VERY understandable. <br/>\nConvinced my<br/>\nhusband that what I was suggesting made sense! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Prenky (not an unschooler) has several books---anything by him <br/>\nwould be worthwhile. But his _Don&#39;t Bother Me , Mom! I&#39;m Learning!_ is <br/>\na great introduction to understanding gaming and the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\nDaniel Pink---also not an unschooler---has written several books on how <br/>\ntraditional schooling/education is failing the modern human. _A Whole <br/>\nNew Mind_ is a good read.<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid Albert has two: _And the Skylark Sings with Me_ and <br/>\n_Homeschooling and the<br/>\nVoyage of Self-Discovery_. Both are witty---and easy reads.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerie Fitzenreiter has a book that I highly recommend: _The<br/>\nUnprocessed Child: Living Without School_. It&#39;s about unschooling her<br/>\ndaughter, Laurie.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s _Moving a Puddle_---a collection of essays. Most can be <br/>\nfound online and at her site, but it&#39;s nice to have them bound---all in <br/>\none place.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy absolute favorite of all time is Rue Kream&#39;s _Parenting a Free <br/>\nChild; An Unschooled Life_. It WILL change your life! Worth its weight <br/>\nin gold!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Connections&quot; e-zine ---online magazine<br/>\n&quot;Life Learning Magazine&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Live Free Learn Free&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;, originally put out by John Holt. No longer <br/>\nin<br/>\nproduction, but back issues available from &quot;old&quot; unschoolers and from <br/>\nFUNbooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebsites:<br/>\n<br/>\n_www.unschooling.info_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info/)\">http://www.unschooling.info/)</a> There are other <br/>\nlists<br/>\nthat &quot;say&quot; they unschool; these are the radicals who KNOW what they are<br/>\ntalking about. There are essays and FAQs which you should definitely <br/>\nread first.<br/>\nAfterwards go to the message boards and read, read, READ! If you have<br/>\nquestions after reading for a few weeks, then post---but most things <br/>\nhave been<br/>\nexplained before, so if you read, you&#39;ll run across the answers to most <br/>\nof your<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\n*note: this has become a rather quiet board---not that *you* can&#39;t make <br/>\nit lively again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:_UnschoolingDiscussion@...\">_UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>_<br/>\n(mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@...\">UnschoolingDiscussion@...</a>) is a great e-list if <br/>\nyou prefer<br/>\nyour messages in mail form.

Near the<br/>\nend of the DVD &quot;The Secret&quot; there is a snippet with Neale Donald Walsch<br/>\n(&quot;Conversations with God&quot; author).

Our purpose is<br/>\nwhatever we make it, whatever we decide for it to be.  There isn&#39;t anything<br/>\nwe are &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing here in this life other than feel love and joy<br/>\nand create what we want for ourselves.  Wow!

I am going to guess<br/>\nthat you were throwing out these ideas in hopes that she did not<br/>\nmeltdown. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Yes, she smelled my fear.. and the opportunity to divide mom and<br/>\ndad.  I thought dh was being rather protective of a big snowball, but<br/>\nhe was very emotional about the whole thing.  She knew I thought he<br/>\nshould lighten up.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen these anger issues would come up with my son, I found<br/>\nthat empathizing first (&quot;oh bummer! It&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit. that really<br/>\nstinks!&quot;) and asking him to figure out what to do next worked a<br/>\nlittle better than throwing out a bunch of ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\n~I think she would go for this. Yeah, I give them ideas all the time.<br/>\n A friend recently suggested that I let them find their own solutions<br/>\ninstead of giving them tons of ideas(we were talking about boredom),<br/>\nbut I think it is definitely an issue with times like this as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if he truly was destroying things I would physically stop him. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how unschooly or proper that is. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Yup, that&#39;s my dilemma.  I&#39;m new at this unschooly thing and I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to fall back into my old patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there was no way I would allow him (or anyone else for that<br/>\nmatter) to come in and<br/>\ndestroy things in our house. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ I recently read a post by Pam S on the &#39;setting limits again&#39; thread:<br/>\nDon&#39;t let them be too rough with you or name call, without saying,<br/>\n&quot;Hey, NOT okay. Stop it now.&quot; And put space between you and them so<br/>\nthey can&#39;t hurt you. Don&#39;t just let them do it. But that&#39;s all you<br/>\nneed to do - that IS the consequence, that you won&#39;t allow it to happen.<br/>\n~This was a big wake up call to me.  The next time my dd started<br/>\ncalling me names I said, &quot;NOT ok.&quot;  Well, that&#39;s when the problems<br/>\nwith dd started to escalate and get more destructive.  Before that it<br/>\nwas just verbal and I could let that roll off my shoulder.  It was<br/>\njust embarassing in front of others, especially my mom who is really<br/>\ntrying to understand.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe apologized on her own, and you told basically told her it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe right thing to do. That&#39;s similar to saying &quot;that&#39;s ok&quot; when<br/>\nsomeone apologizes. It&#39;s NOT ok. Say &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;I appreciate<br/>\nyour apology&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Gulp.  This one felt wrong when I was writing it.  It felt very<br/>\nvulnerable to admit.  At the time I thought I didn&#39;t want to make her<br/>\nfeel guilty.  the shaming thing.  I do enough of that as it is and I<br/>\nam really trying hard to notice when I do and change it.  You&#39;re<br/>\nright, I was telling her it was OK, essentially giving her permission<br/>\nto do it again.  I wasn&#39;t trying to guilt her into apologizing.  On<br/>\nthe other hand, I&#39;m not sure her apology was sincere.  In retrospect<br/>\nit was manipulative to get me to let down my guard so she could<br/>\nfurther destroy my bed.  I&#39;m gonna go with, &quot;thank you&quot; from now on. <br/>\nMaybe that won&#39;t seem so spineless.<br/>\n<br/>\nhe would have heard, &quot;you don&#39;t know any better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Yikes!  I never thought about it like that.  I guess I am telling her<br/>\nthat she can&#39;t do it.  I don&#39;t expect her to do it, so she never will.<br/>\n So I just need to tell her that she can find a solution.  Empower her<br/>\n&lt;lightbulb goes on!&gt;.  aargh.  I know this stuff!  I&#39;ve read it so<br/>\nmany times.  Why didn&#39;t I see it?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be wrong to let her know that what she is doing is<br/>\nmaking you angry/upset/ tired or [insert emotion here]? Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\nbetter to be more realistic here, than to try and be &quot;nice&quot;. That&#39;s a<br/>\nquestion I have as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n~That makes sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAsk HER what sort of helps she wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n~This is where I think we are both stuck.  I have told her she needs<br/>\nmy help, so she doesn&#39;t know what sort of help she wants.  I bet she<br/>\ncan come up with some great solutions if I just give her a little<br/>\ntrust and encouragment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Ren&#39;s idea of having a safe place to retreat to and get some<br/>\nanger and energy out. She sounds FULL of it! <br/>\n<br/>\n~We have these things, but they are spread out all over the house.  I<br/>\nlike the idea of consolidating them so her has a retreat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just things I have found myself doing with my highly<br/>\nphysical son. He&#39;s 9 now, much better with his emotions, and a<br/>\nwrestler on a team instead of with his mom. <br/>\n<br/>\n~I would love to find something like this for my son.  Can I email you<br/>\noff list with some questions?  Unless you think everyone would like to<br/>\nhear more about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wondering why you feel that it&#39;s not ok for you to be angry?<br/>\nHow could your child possibly<br/>\nlearn to deal with her anger if you aren&#39;t dealing with yours? <br/>\n<br/>\n~The verbal things did not make me angry.  They rarely happened in<br/>\npublic.  She is usually only like this at home.  I just felt sad for<br/>\nher when she said mean things to me.  You know the old saying no one<br/>\ncan hurt you unless you let them.  I took that power away from her by<br/>\nnot letting her words/actions make me angry.  After all they are just<br/>\nthings and she is more important.  It&#39;s the threats on personal safety<br/>\nthat concern me.  She&#39;s never actually done anything physically<br/>\nharmful, but she threatens.  I think if push came to shove she would<br/>\nnot jeopardize anyone&#39;s safety.  She would be hesitant, but if she<br/>\nthought I was OK with it, she would definitely try it.  So I also need<br/>\nto be very clear about my words.  I do get angry when they fight with<br/>\neach other.  She does see me handle my anger then.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been so helpful.  No only to mull around new ideas in my<br/>\nhead, but to put it all in writing.

They<br/>\n&gt;built it very big and tall.  DD wanted to put her coat on the snowman<br/>\n&gt;and it wouldn&#39;t fit.  Dh was not willing to let her try until it fell<br/>\n&gt;over.  I offered to make another snowman for her, I offered to get<br/>\n&gt;her shawl, poncho, something that would fit, whatever.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like right here is where she got you.  I am going to guess<br/>\nthat you were throwing out these ideas in hopes that she did not<br/>\nmeltdown.  When these anger issues would come up with my son, I found<br/>\nthat empathizing first (&quot;oh bummer!  It&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit.  that really<br/>\nstinks!&quot;)  and asking him to figure out what to do next worked a<br/>\nlittle better than throwing out a bunch of ideas. (not always but<br/>\nsometimes) That way, it was still HIS idea and he still felt in<br/>\ncontrol.  This took practice though.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;She wanted just that coat, period.  So she got angry and went inside.<br/>\n&gt;I followed to see if I could help her and protect the contents of<br/>\n&gt;the house.  She slammed the door and told me to go away. I wanted to<br/>\n&gt;be in the house, so I went in the garage door.  She screamed at me<br/>\n&gt;and told me to get out of the house.  That option did not work for<br/>\n&gt;me.  She started grabbing things and throwing.  I waited patiently<br/>\n&gt;and tried to stop her from destroying things.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>At this point, I wouldn&#39;t wait patiently. With my older son, I warned<br/>\nhim once and told him &quot;I will NOT let you destroy [insert thing here].<br/>\n And if he truly was destroying things I would physically stop him.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how unschooly or proper that is.  But there was no way I<br/>\nwould allow him (or anyone else for that matter) to come in and<br/>\ndestroy things in our house.  I never hurt him, or used any force<br/>\nbeyond keeping myself and him safe.  And he knew very quickly that<br/>\nbeing destructive wasn&#39;t the best way to get his point across.  We<br/>\noften waited until things were calm to discuss other options.  For<br/>\nexample, &quot;I see that when you&#39;re angry you need to be alone, but I<br/>\nfeel that I can&#39;t trust you around [insert stuff in house here] when<br/>\nyou destroy things.  How can we work that out?&quot;  I don&#39;t remember the<br/>\nexact conversations, but something along those lines.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;After her fit, she stormed upstairs.  She took a marker and started<br/>\n&gt;marking on our sheets.  Then she came downstairs, said she was sorry.<br/>\n&gt;I told her she didn&#39;t need to be sorry.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>She apologized on her own, and you told basically told her it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthe right thing to do.  That&#39;s similar to saying &quot;that&#39;s ok&quot; when<br/>\nsomeone apologizes.  It&#39;s NOT ok.  Say &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;I appreciate<br/>\nyour apology&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I loved her and I understood that she didn&#39;t know any better way to<br/>\n&gt;get out her anger.  I told her I would like to help her find better<br/>\n&gt;ways and she said she didn&#39;t feel like talking.  She sneaked out into<br/>\n&gt;the garage and got some gum out of her dad&#39;s car, chewed it, then<br/>\n&gt;went upstairs and put it on our headboard of our bed.  I figured it<br/>\n&gt;out about 15 minutes too late.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Knowing how sensitive my son was with words, if I had said that to<br/>\nhim...  he would have heard &quot;I love you&quot;.  Good.  But then he would<br/>\nhave heard, &quot;you don&#39;t know any better.&quot;  And that would have set him<br/>\noff again.  He still does that with my words sometimes.  It&#39;s hard to<br/>\nbe clear.  Would it be wrong to let her know that what she is doing is<br/>\nmaking you angry/upset/tired or [insert emotion here]?  Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>\nbetter to be more realistic here, than to try and be &quot;nice&quot;.  That&#39;s a<br/>\nquestion I have as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How do I get out of the cycle of her demanding everything she wants,<br/>\n&gt;me being as nice as I can and her taking advantage and back stabbing?<br/>\n&gt;I&#39;m trying to be kind all the time, but I&#39;m starting to feel<br/>\n&gt;foolish.  If I try to stand my ground, it&#39;s world war 3.  I just<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t know where to draw the line on kindness and how to handle<br/>\n&gt;physical confrontation.  What do I do if she starts throwing glasses<br/>\n&gt;at the kitchen window?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t have to be as kind/nice as you can.  I&#39;m not suggesting you<br/>\nbe mean.  I&#39;m just saying, when you child is going bonkers and putting<br/>\nherself and others in danger it&#39;s time for action.  When she starts<br/>\nthrowing glasses at the kitchen window you can/should/need to<br/>\nphysically stop her and yell &quot;NO, I won&#39;t let you do that!&quot; <br/>\nUnschooling and peaceful parenting does not mean hands off and<br/>\neverybody talks in a nice calm voice 24/7.  People have emotions and<br/>\nreactions.  Even you.  It&#39;s your job to keep her and others safe.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I can&#39;t tell when she is angry because she hides it.  I offer to<br/>\n&gt;help.  She says she wants help and then says she hates talking.  She<br/>\n&gt;told me she will say anything to get out of talking to me about what<br/>\n&gt;she wants (I&#39;m not sure she knows).  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Talking too much drives some kids nuts!  You know the husband that<br/>\ncomplains about nagging wife?  It&#39;s usually because when his wife<br/>\nwants/needs something she goes on for an hour about something.  Same<br/>\nidea.   Mine doesn&#39;t like to talk unless he initiates it.  Usually I<br/>\njust listen.  Ask HER what sort of helps she wants.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How do I help if she doesn&#39;t want to talk?  She contradicts herself<br/>\n&gt;constantly... in the same conversation.  How can I be consensual if<br/>\n&gt;she claims the only thing she consistently wants is to make us all<br/>\n&gt;angry and miserable like her?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By just being there.  How about just listening without commenting?  In<br/>\nthe heat of the moment or even directly afterward isn&#39;t always the<br/>\nbest time for you to be talking, but she may have loads to get off her<br/>\nchest.  How about having a snack together later in the day or the next<br/>\nday and having a chat? How about asking her questions, and see if she<br/>\nhas any ideas.  Let her know she&#39;s affecting others and see if she<br/>\ncomes up with ideas.  She might not come up with any.  You&#39;re out of<br/>\nideas.  Maybe she has some.  Maybe she wants to be held not talked to?<br/>\n I like Ren&#39;s idea of having a safe place to retreat to and get some<br/>\nanger and energy out. She sounds FULL of it!   Is she distractable? <br/>\nDistraction is sometimes a good way to bring her back to you.  I think<br/>\nits works better with the young ones though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just things I have found myself doing with my highly<br/>\nphysical son.  He&#39;s 9 now, much better with his emotions, and a<br/>\nwrestler on a team instead of with his mom.  LOL  I&#39;m actually hoping<br/>\nKelly or someone will read this and comment on what I wrote here.  It<br/>\nis sounding a bit harsh.  But I feel that personal safety is extremely<br/>\nimportant and needs to addressed very fast and seriously before<br/>\nsomeone catches a glass to the head.  I also wondering why you feel<br/>\nthat it&#39;s not ok for you to be angry?

So she has<br/>\nyou right there until the process is complete? <br/>\n<br/>\n~She will let me if she is not mad at me. I do that.  I sit outside her door to give her privacy and let her know I&#39;m there if she needs me.  I tell her that I am here for her and I will go if she wants me to.  She can&#39;t tell me to stay (ask for help), but she will not tell me to go (making me think she wants me there).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe might be trying to hurt you back for some of the hurt she<br/>\nexperienced before but is unable to put it into words just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Maybe, but she says she is afraid to hurt me physically.  She knows that she has hurt me a lot too.  I think she does feel guilty about it as well.  When I suggest she let her anger out, she is afraid to because she doesn&#39;t want to hurt me.  I suggested pillows and such, but she said that feels silly to her.  She seems to be destroying to feel powerful, so it has to genuinely hurt someone else emotionally.  I&#39;ve already said, &quot;if that&#39;s what you need to do to let out your anger, go ahead.&quot;  That really diffuses the situation.  She said it ruins it for her.  The problem is that I can&#39;t always say that.  She knows when I&#39;m bluffing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you make a &quot;high energy&quot; area for her? <br/>\n<br/>\n~We have a punching bag, mattress/boxspring to jump on, park and rec center in walking distance.  I do think part of it is her needing to let out energy.  The problem is that she is choosing TV instead of activity.  If I ask her to do something active, she declines.  We had two days of gorgeous weather and she never came outside.  Ds and I were out there the whole time!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when you reflect back to her? <br/>\n<br/>\n~She HATES that.  Originally she would look at me and say, &quot;well, duh! I&#39;m not stupid, but you are.&quot;  Now, it just fuels her anger.  She&#39;ll take my reflection and magnify it.  I just feel like I can&#39;t find the right words.  The less I say the better, but sometimes I have to say things like, &quot;put the glass down.&quot;  She challenges me, forcing me to grab the glass.  Then it becomes a fight for the glass.  That&#39;s what I want to avoid before it gets that far, but the words are eluding me.    <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your suggestions.  I&#39;m gonna see what I can do to make activity more interesting.  I don&#39;t mind that she is watching TV, I just know that is not making her happy.  She&#39;s usually a very active and social kid, and she seems to be choosing tv out of boredom.  I&#39;ve suggested things around the house until I was blue in the face and she is not interested. I think I&#39;m going to need to look outside to find something for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nClaudia <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gpwthread.blogspot.com/\">http://gpwthread.blogspot.com/</a> <br/>\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot;  ~John Irving<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?

She wants her way or no other way.  She sees CL as a weakness in dh and I.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, let me say, these are isolated incidents, because she mostly gets what she wants, from me anyway.  Here&#39;s an example (I&#39;m sorry I knew I should have put in an example, I don&#39;t know what I was thinking)<br/>\n<br/>\nDH decided to build a snowman and asked the kids to join him.  They built it very big and tall.  DD wanted to put her coat on the snowman and it wouldn&#39;t fit.  Dh was not willing to let her try until it fell over.  I offered to make another snowman for her, I offered to get her shawl, poncho, something that would fit, whatever.  She wanted just that coat, period.  So she got angry and went inside.  I followed to see if I could help her and protect the contents of the house.  She slammed the door and told me to go away. I wanted to be in the house, so I went in the garage door.  She screamed at me and told me to get out of the house.  That option did not work for me.  She started grabbing things and throwing.  I waited patiently and tried to stop her from destroying things.  After her fit, she stormed upstairs.  She took a marker and started marking on our sheets.  Then she came downstairs, said she was sorry.  I told her she didn&#39;t need to be sorry.  I loved her and I<br/>\n understood that she didn&#39;t know any better way to get out her anger.  I told her I would like to help her find better ways and she said she didn&#39;t feel like talking.  She sneaked out into the garage and got some gum out of her dad&#39;s car, chewed it, then went upstairs and put it on our headboard of our bed.  I figured it out about 15 minutes too late.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I get out of the cycle of her demanding everything she wants, me being as nice as I can and her taking advantage and back stabbing?  I&#39;m trying to be kind all the time, but I&#39;m starting to feel foolish.  If I try to stand my ground, it&#39;s world war 3.  I just don&#39;t know where to draw the line on kindness and how to handle physical confrontation.  What do I do if she starts throwing glasses at the kitchen window?<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t tell when she is angry because she hides it.  I offer to help.  She says she wants help and then says she hates talking.  She told me she will say anything to get out of talking to me about what she wants (I&#39;m not sure she knows).  How do I help if she doesn&#39;t want to talk?  She contradicts herself constantly... in the same conversation.  How can I be consensual if she claims the only thing she consistently wants is to make us all angry and miserable like her?<br/>\n<br/>\nClaudia <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gpwthread.blogspot.com/\">http://gpwthread.blogspot.com/</a> <br/>\n&quot;If you are lucky enough to find a way of life you love, you have to find the courage to live it.&quot;  ~John Irving<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

I&#39;ve been lurking since Dec and gaining<br/>\nlots of information.  I have a dd8 and ds7.  We&#39;ve been unschooling<br/>\nsince Sept.  We did &#39;school at home&#39; before that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been following the thread about setting limits and was hoping I<br/>\ncould expand the topic a little more.  What do you do when you child<br/>\nwill not accept or follow the limits?  She is great at following<br/>\nlimits/rules when she is not angry.  When she gets angry, she hides<br/>\nher anger and secretly destroys things. We are not a family that ever<br/>\nhides our anger.  She sees us handle our anger in appropriate ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the bigger question is, how do I get her to let out her anger<br/>\nin a healthy way if she avoids me and refuses to talk about it later?<br/>\n I&#39;ve tried talking to her when she is not angry. She&#39;s been in<br/>\ntherapy (we left because it was no longer helpful).  She said when she<br/>\nis angry, she just wants to make everyone around her as angry as she<br/>\nis.  She likes being angry and destroying things.  I wish this was a<br/>\nphase that I could wait out, but she&#39;s been doing it since she was 5<br/>\nand shows no signs of stopping.
