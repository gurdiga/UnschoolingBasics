First of all a few people suggested that I deschool myself <br/>\nfor a while.  I did not think I needed to do so because I had <br/>\nalready deschooled about 2 yrs ago.  BUT I took the advice and <br/>\nrealized that I did need that time.  My family is peaceful again and <br/>\nwe are happy.  This is what is most important for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I have taken the time to observe what my children are doing and <br/>\nlearning as they go throughout their day.  I am also being mindful <br/>\nto not get so lost in my projects that I look up and realize that I <br/>\nhave not been much connected to my children at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day and thought came to me.  I have studied ancient <br/>\nEgyptian spirituality.  What I learned is that we have a guiding <br/>\nforce, a divine intelligence within us that operates independent of <br/>\nour consciousness.  It is what assists with our breathing, heart <br/>\npumping, hormone balancing and all that good stuff that keeps us up <br/>\nand going.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember learning about this Divine Intellgence after having my <br/>\nfirst son.  I remember deciding to trust the Divine Intelligence <br/>\nwithin him as an infant with respect to breastfeeding, holding him <br/>\nand whatever I felt he was leading me to do.  I remember feeling so <br/>\ncriticized by others who thought that doing it the ususal American <br/>\nway THE WAY and usually told me how wrong I was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I decided that despite, I would just trust my children&#39;s inner <br/>\nknowing as infants and even smaller children.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I thought about this the other day, I had a serious ah-ha <br/>\nmoment.  I just knew in that moment that the SAME Divine <br/>\nIntelligence would also lead and guide and direct my children&#39;s <br/>\nlearning...actually better than I ever could.  This thought brought <br/>\nso much peace to me.  So now I simply seek to create opportunities <br/>\nof joy for my children.  What makes them happy?  How can we have fun <br/>\nand a good time?  Because when we have fun we learn things.  We love <br/>\neach other and we can truly cherish the moments that we have right <br/>\nnow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I share this with you all in hopes that someone else will receive <br/>\nsome encouragement to trust this process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI give thanks for this unschoolingbasics group because no one else <br/>\nreally understands and feels me unless they are unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Love<br/>\nTyra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26065,"nextTopicId":26003}}
