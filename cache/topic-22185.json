We are a<br/>\nsupport group for parents/guardians of unschoolers. We are pretty relaxed<br/>\nabout pretty much everything. We are a secular (non-religious-affiliated)<br/>\ngroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschoolers, we believe that child-led learning is preferable to<br/>\ncurriculum use. We are not a conservative school-at-home group, and find<br/>\nlittle reason to discuss curriculum but can get intense about respecting<br/>\nchildren and about learning. It is understood that each family is at a<br/>\ndifferent point in their journey. Not everyone on this list will be an<br/>\nunschooler; some may be exploring the idea, others may be relaxed<br/>\nhomeschoolers interested in unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we also see as paramount is having fun and playing together! Basically,<br/>\nwe like our kids, like each other&#39;s kids and enjoy spending time together.<br/>\nWe have regular park days, seasonal parties, field trips, &quot;meet & greets,&quot;<br/>\nvolunteer opportunities, and other events.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are based in Southern NH Nashua/Manchester, and have members from all<br/>\nover the surrounding areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoin us and help expand our circle with the goal of our kids being a part of<br/>\na larger group of kids who are &quot;in the same boat&quot; more or less!  We&#39;re<br/>\nlooking to shatter the image of the loney, socially awkward homeschooler who<br/>\nknows nobody else like him/herself.  We want our kids to feel like *they*<br/>\nare the norm and have a huge group of unschooled friends to prove it!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22134,"nextTopicId":21868}}
