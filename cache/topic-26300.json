Healing is a different story......the first <br/>\ntime it took at least six months to heal.  I had to be to faithful <br/>\ncleaning it 2-3 times a day.  I will suggest H2Ocean, it&#39;s a spray <br/>\nand very easy to do and has cut healing times for me or try <br/>\nCamphonique.  I suggest these because when I used what the place gave <br/>\nme my piercing took forever to heal.  As far as scaring there is only <br/>\n1 &quot;old hole&quot; you can see but that could be because I pierced that <br/>\nspot 3-4times lol.
