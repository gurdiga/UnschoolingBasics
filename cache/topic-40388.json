I (then) said it didn&#39;t occur during the rest of the day.  She revealed to me that she was afraid Daddy would get mad at her for things she does (which he did; he&#39;d chastise for things that bothered him but don&#39;t bother me).  I now know both my girls, but esp my youngest (to which I just referred), feels more comfortable around me.  This bothers my dh but he feels rather helpless as he feels he can&#39;t just ignore what bugs him when the kids do things he feels needs to be addressed.  It&#39;s a work in progress--and we have made progress.  :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I used to get upset that my girls, esp. my youngest, would spout out anger and really show when they were upset but around Daddy they would just bottle it up.  I thought they were showing me disrespect and him respect!  Now, I realize they feel free to express their troubles, which is healthy (as long as nothing&#39;s being thrown at me!), around me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy .02,<br/>\n~Melissa , in MD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Recent Activity<br/>\n    a..  13New Members<br/>\n  Visit Your Group <br/>\n  Sell Online<br/>\n  Start selling with<br/>\n<br/>\n  our award-winning<br/>\n<br/>\n  e-commerce tools.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Y!

Ava is deeply attached to nursing and I think taking that away from her would not be a good thing right now. I really want her to self wean.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t make it this far nursing her sister. So this stage is new to me. I am glad to know that the feelings I&#39;m having are normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all so very much for all of the advice and suggestions. <br/>\nI never thought of asking her if she wanted to nurse.<br/>\nEven the times I tell her to hold on...like you can have ni-nights after I&#39;m done putting the laundry in the washer. She freaks out on me. Falling on the floor screaming no and crying. She doesn&#39;t like to wait at all, she wants it right then and there. She gets upset if I take too long to get my shirt up, lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel so out of tune to my children these days. I am usually pretty good at anticipating needs, but not so much lately.<br/>\nI tried talking to my husband about it, but he said this s what I asked for and all he&#39;s read about nursing toddlers this is all normal.<br/>\nThat wasn&#39;t very helpful or supportive to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of you have asked if Nakiah really whines all the time, and the answer to that is yes. Except for when she&#39;s sleeping :)<br/>\nWell it&#39;s not ALL THE TIME, but it seems that way....she whines inbetween breakfast,lunch and dinner, inbetween playtime and other activities. I swear as soon as we finish something she starts whining!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wanted to go to the park, so we went. She whined the entire time we were there, didn&#39;t want to play and it got dark so we headed home, more whining and crying all the way back home.<br/>\nWe asked her if she wanted to play hide and go seek with us in the dark, nope more whining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wakes up whining. I don&#39;t know what happened for a while we were all doing so well, she was talking and she had quit falling allover her dad. Now it&#39;s all started again.<br/>\nShe gets lots of hugs and kisses and I love you all throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we aren&#39;t the ones doing all of the hugs and kisses she will come up to us and give us a hug or kiss or say I love you.<br/>\nMy husband is getting frustrated again because she won&#39;t listen to him. He always has to call me in and that makes me feel like the bad guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food goes I do offer it to her. She eats when we eat and whenever she wants. Even i she doesn&#39;t eat right when we do, when she is hungry she eats.<br/>\nI think she likes to whine. Like someone else said she has learned that it works. <br/>\nMost of this whining occurs when my husband is home, she doesn&#39;t act like that around me when he&#39;s not here, she talks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day when it was raining we didn&#39;t want her out in the rain because it was storming. We had storms off an don that day. Later in the evening when the thunder and lightning had let up we went out and played in the rain. She didn&#39;t even want her bike then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was one day this week where she didn&#39;t whine. She wasn&#39;t feeling well that day. Her and her sister had fevers over the course of 2-3 days. That day she slept off and on and when she was awake sshe talked, no whining.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any other yahoo groups or blogs for my husband to read? Videos? I&#39;ve sent him the link to Sandra&#39;s site for dads.

It might help a lot if you don&#39;t see it or say it as constantly. She sometimes whines, she whines with some relative frequency, but constantly is every minute of every day and night and I&#39;m betting you she sleeps sometimes ;).<br/>\n<br/>\n It is amazing how much of a difference perception can make. If I see Simon as sulking all the time, when he does do it, if he does do it, I have to get over the grudge that I&#39;m carrying that he is doing this thing that he makes me suffer all the time. If instead I don&#39;t see it as something perpetual but see it as one of the many moods that he may or may not express than I can respond to it as something that is happening right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe couldn&#39;t ride her bike. Maybe she was really looking forward to it. Crying is a reasonable way to express disappointment. Sitting with her while she cries is the best response you can offer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as food restrictions, offer food. Don&#39;t wait for a 4 year old to remember to eat, bring food to her so that she can eat when she&#39;s hungry. If I&#39;m busy it is easy to forget that I haven&#39;t eaten for a while. I figure Simon and Linnaea have the same experience I do.

By the time she<br/>\nasks/whines<br/>\n<br/>\nit has already repeated in her mind several times. I dont think kids this<br/>\nage (particularly still nursing ones) have fully differentiated themselves <br/>\nfrom (particularly) their mothers, thus, for her, something in her mind is<br/>\nas good as told to you (dont we all wish we were mind readers?) By the time<br/>\nit <br/>\n<br/>\ncomes out of her mouth, shes already asked (in her mind) a couple of<br/>\ntimesthus the whiny desperation. On the other hand, maybe Im totally off,<br/>\nbut <br/>\n<br/>\ntelling myself helps me not mind the whining at least! I also remind her to<br/>\nask in a normal voice, a lot, but per my previous comments, I dont think<br/>\nits <br/>\n<br/>\nreally fair that I expect that considering the urgency shes probably<br/>\nfeeling regarding a need when she starts to whine.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding nursing, fist let me say I AM NOT a fan of behaviorism in general.<br/>\nHowever, something that my aunt (who is a therapist) once told me really<br/>\n<br/>\nstuck with meit helped me modify MY behavior (which I dont think was her<br/>\nobjective). Consistency is keyif a child (or anyone) asks for something <br/>\n<br/>\nroutinely, and sometimes gets it and sometimes doesnt, they will keep<br/>\nasking.frequently.since it is totally random as to whether or not they<br/>\nwill <br/>\n<br/>\nget what they are asking for (Im particularly thinking of the nursing.) If<br/>\nyou want to eliminate the frequent asking, then there are 3 ways.say yes<br/>\nall of the <br/>\n<br/>\ntime (we tend to ask more frequently for scarce resources), say no all of<br/>\nthe time (shell eventually get that the activity is no longer an option),<br/>\nor have <br/>\n<br/>\npredictable times for the activity (whatever works for you.upon waking,<br/>\nbefore sleeping, during a set time or a specific tv show, ect.) and then<br/>\nmake a <br/>\n<br/>\npoint of setting aside that time for her and the activity (as in sit on the<br/>\ncouch and say this is the time to nurse, if you want to nurse I will be here<br/>\nfor the next <br/>\n<br/>\n15 minutes, if not, then you can nurse at the next set time)  and then give<br/>\nher that time and your undivided attention, whether or not she opts for the<br/>\nactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n2 is a difficult age, they act like little people, but are still very much<br/>\ninfantsthey fool you with the talking and self dressing and stuff. Maybe<br/>\nAva is having a <br/>\n<br/>\nhard time being treated less like a baby (that she still feels she is)  Her<br/>\nneeds have been met immediately (on-demand nursing) for the last 2 years and<br/>\nnow<br/>\n<br/>\nshe is being told to wait for the (to her) arbitrary reason of age (which<br/>\nshe probably does not relate toMaya tells everyone who asks that she is 4,<br/>\nbecause <br/>\n<br/>\nthat is her favorite number) When I put Maya off for a moment, it is very<br/>\nspecific.when this show is over you can nurse, when I get down off the<br/>\nladder you <br/>\n<br/>\ncan nurse.whatever, and  another mom here suggested then narrating your<br/>\nprogress towards that end (Im climbing down, Ive got 2 more steps, Im<br/>\nwalking <br/>\n<br/>\ntowards the couch where we can nurse, ect) so that she knows it is really<br/>\nclosetime is really hard to conceptualize at that age.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou did not mention if you were trying to wean or notbut it sounds like<br/>\nnot.  I guess that will make a big difference in how you deal with this. I<br/>\nget to feeling <br/>\n<br/>\nvery nursed outand I mean VERY! Its happened to me about 3 times in 2 ½<br/>\nyears and generally lasts 2-3 months. I also notice, when Im feeling this<br/>\nway I <br/>\n<br/>\nwithhold more nursing, and then my daughter wants to nurse more (scarce<br/>\nresource)kind of a vicious cycle. (I just ended a nursed out phase I posted<br/>\nabout on <br/>\n<br/>\nhere about a month or 2 ago in fact, and we are both happily enjoying that<br/>\nactivity again) When I am feeling nursed out (if this is your case) a couple<br/>\nof things I try to do are<br/>\n<br/>\n*have special time with my husband, feeling connected to him helps me give<br/>\nmore of myself to my family<br/>\n<br/>\n*remember that she will not nurse forever and it is just a phase for her<br/>\n(nursing) and me (feeling nursed out)<br/>\n<br/>\n*make some alone time for myself (a cup of tea, a shower alone J, 10 minutes<br/>\nwith a good magazine) to rechargeeven a couple of times a day<br/>\n<br/>\n*say yes to the requests for nursing with a smile.i think smiles change<br/>\nyour body chemistry<br/>\n<br/>\n*talk to EVERYONE who will listen sympathetically about it.yup, these are<br/>\nsort of gripe sessions, but they make me feel better...to know that others<br/>\ncare and to <br/>\n<br/>\n           trade storiesif people will not be supportive about our extended<br/>\nnursing when I am already feeling down about it, I dont talk to them (which<br/>\nhas eliminated ALL <br/>\n<br/>\n           of my close friends at this point), but there are still LLL<br/>\nmeetings, mothering.com, this list, AP lists, ect..<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you guys dont have any problems (regarding what you posted<br/>\nabout)maybe your girls are just going through their unique (and probably<br/>\nslightly annoying) <br/>\n<br/>\ndevelopmental stages and you and your husband just have to breathe deep,<br/>\nlook for ways to recharge your batteries as needed, and know that these are<br/>\nphases that will pass. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Help! 2yr old crying 4 yr old whining","postDate":"1244259609","msgId":40405,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQxNjUxMjUyLTMyODktNDBDMi1CQ0JELTVEOEM4RkZCQjkwNkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGgwYjUyNisxOGIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgwYjUyNisxOGIzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40404,"nextInTopic":40406,"prevInTime":40404,"nextInTime":40406,"topicId":40388,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You don t have to save her from her emotions.

Do you want to stop or limit nursings?  Maybe she is sensing a reluctance to nurse and is frightened to lose that closeness/attention/time/food with you so she is nursing more to hang onto it?<br/>\n<br/>\nCould she be ill or fending off a cold?  Children sometimes nurse more to fight off colds and they may not be able to verbalize they are feeling ill, they just know nursing will help.    <br/>\n<br/>\nSince you&#39;ve tried offerring other closeness and playtime and she gets very upset, it sounds like she is telling you only nursing will do for now.  Could you be proactive and offer to nurse her lovingly and sincerely before she even would likely ask to nurse?  She might be pleasantly surprised and this might meet her needs (no matter why she wants to nurse so often).  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to eliminate some of your nursing, there are resources by La Leche League that might be helpful. Some books to check out are How Weaning Happens and The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. If you want to continue and want more support for extended breastfeeding, Mothering Your Nursing Toddler is a lovely book. <br/>\n<br/>\nHang in there.  Children have very important needs always, they just change over time.  This (nursing) must be what she feels makes things better at this point in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Nakiah(4yr old) whines about everything. Instead of saying she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; hungry she will walk up to her dad and start falling all over him<br/>\n&gt; whining. She does this with him for anything she wants. Most of the <br/>\n&gt; time instead of asking for what she wants she whines about it. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Start thinking about each specific situation.  Is there anything you or your dh can do to ahead of time to help your child before he asks for something or falls onto your dh?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your dd still get attention even if she doesn&#39;t resort to behaviors and voices you don&#39;t like?  Does she do the falling over because she needs attention?  Can dh give her extra attention before she falls over him?  Wouldn it feel good to her to have daddy scoop her up in a big hug before she even comes toward him?  <br/>\n<br/>\n**Eliminate her feeling like she isn&#39;t getting enough love....shower her with love and attention before she craves it.**<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Drives us nuts. We keep telling her all she has to do is talk and <br/>\n&gt; ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you are simply asking her to use a &quot;regular&quot; voice and go on as usual (ask this in a regular voice yourself).  Keep doing this.  Give it time.  As you meet your dds needs before she resorts to using a voice you don&#39;t like, she will feel more like using a &quot;regular&quot; voice.  Make sure to respond promptly when she asks - this makes it easier for her to be her best.  Limit as much as possible her having to wait.  (It sounds like her frustration and not having the ability to be patient as long as you wish she&#39;d be might lead her to becoming upset/&quot;whining&quot;/etc - and heck, even we adults who have had years to develop patience and deal with frustration aren&#39;t patient and feel like we want to yell sometimes).  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She gets upset when her sister wants to share daddy&#39;s lap. Last <br/>\n&gt; night she put her fist and arm in her sisters face to block her <br/>\n&gt; from laying her head down on his shoulder.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like our house where Daddy is greeted excitedly when he comes home.  It is hard when more than one child wants a parent&#39;s attention.  If it is an ongoing thing, talk about what you could do so everyone has Daddy time and Mommy time too...like maybe each parent have 1 on 1 time and then switch.  Heck, and then mommy and daddy get to hug too!  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; For the most part the girls are best friends.

He can be quite melodramatic. :) Calm voices and a change of subject help if he goes overboard but sometimes he just wants to put his head down. It&#39;s tough being little. Many things to do and explore, some not available, some just take hard work. It&#39;s constant activity and it doesn&#39;t always go smoothly. So the arm goes up over the eyes and the head goes down and there&#39;s a big &quot;woe is me&quot; show. Then something catches his eye and he goes back to playing. <br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been a constant in our house the past few months. It&#39;s driving me<br/>\ncrazy!
