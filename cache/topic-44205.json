Undoubtedly many teachers believe it too.

Occasionally a kid will find the process of 100<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Easy Lessons goes along with the way they&#39;re assembling their<br/>\n&gt; &gt;understanding, BUT very often it&#39;s just frustrating. And by<br/>\n&gt; &gt;perpetuating the myth that reading can be taught, the child can feel<br/>\n&gt; &gt;like there&#39;s something wrong with them.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Here are two links that will probably not only answer the questions<br/>\n&gt; &gt;you have about reading but answer some questions you hadn&#39;t thought  <br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt;ask ;-)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/reading\">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n&gt; &gt;(scroll down the left side to the section on reading)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Joyce<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154781355,"authorName":"crystal rid","from":"crystal rid &lt;cryway2@...&gt;","profile":"cryway2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: reading?","postDate":"1274312374","msgId":44215,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNzQ4OS43NDY3Ny5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44214,"nextInTopic":44228,"prevInTime":44214,"nextInTime":44216,"topicId":44205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I will try that.

Let her know that she&#39;ll read when she is ready to read and in the mean time, you are happy to read anything she wants. Reassure her, perhaps, by talking about ways she&#39;s different from her sister - what other things have they learned differently? Did they walk and talk at the same ages and in the same ways? Let her know that its perfectly normal for some people to learn to read sooner and other people to learn other things sooner - everyone is different. <br/>\n<br/>\nJJ&#39;s comment about sight-reading and symbols is a good point - this next is along the lines of &quot;different people learn differently&quot;. Sometimes people start out reading whole &quot;chunks&quot; of meaning, so logos will really &quot;click&quot; at first, but also things like names, street signs and even sentences. A friend of mine&#39;s dd could read short sentences before she could read all the words in them. It sounds backwards, right? but a word like &quot;get&quot; or &quot;bring&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything on its own. &quot;Get the cereal and bring it to the table&quot; has a Lot of meaning. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics are a headache for a lot of people. Kids like my friend&#39;s dd and my stepson find them baffling *until* they already know how to read. Again, that sounds backwards, but once they can read, the phonics rules suddenly make sense to them and they can use that information to figure out new words. <br/>\n<br/>\n(And other people, like my dd, take to phonics like ducks to water.)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: reading?","postDate":"1274295771","msgId":44211,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh0MWNrcis1N2c1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE1NDYzMi41ODQxMS5xbUB3ZWIxMTMzMDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44210,"nextInTopic":44212,"prevInTime":44210,"nextInTime":44212,"topicId":44205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ah -- so you might play around with the possibility she is more graphic-oriented and that s why the trademarked business symbol-words are working for her.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1591150726\">Ah -- so you might play around with the possibility she is more graphic-oriented and that&#39;s why the trademarked business symbol-words are working for her.
