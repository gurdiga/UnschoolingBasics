Most is guess work based on a bits and  <br/>\npieces of philosophy gathered over a lifetime that actually don&#39;t  <br/>\nwork together. Which is why parents think parenting is so hard!

Those would be good reasons to bite your tongue. If you&#39;re wanting to offer up a gentler perspective in the moment it can be enough to make a &quot;normal&quot; sort of comment like &quot;parenting&#39;s a lot of hard work, sometimes&quot; or &quot;some kids are easier to parent than others.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;ve talked about unschooling with other, non-unschooling parents its usually outside of situations like the one you&#39;ve described - its just not helpful to get into a debate at a time like that.
