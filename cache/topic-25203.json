Put the car in second gear, and push the clutch all the way in.<br/>\n   2. Turn the key to the on position.<br/>\n   3. Get someone to push the car for you, or, if you&#39;re lucky enough to<br/>\n   be on a hill, just let it roll! (if your car is small enough, open the<br/>\n   driver&#39;s door and push yourself, when it&#39;s up to a slow jog speed, jump in<br/>\n   and ...)<br/>\n   4. Once the car&#39;s rolling, let out the clutch and immediately give the<br/>\n   car some gas. The engine should catch, and now you can drive it like you<br/>\n   usually would.
