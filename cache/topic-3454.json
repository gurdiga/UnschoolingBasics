He may not get the concept of stealing. I was talking to my now teen niece about some stuff she took when she was a kid. She said she didn&#39;t do it to be an ass. She did it because it was shiny and cool and she just couldn&#39;t resist playing with it. I suspect that is where you 5 year old is at. If you already give him an allowance, I think I would reconsider how I doled it out. Instead of giving him 5 dollars at the end of the week, I would give him a little bit of change every day. My 5 year doesn&#39;t really get the concept of money. She knows that you use it to buy stuff but distinguishing the value of each coin or bill is still a bit lost on her. My 8 year old loves having an allowance and has always loved to play with money and count money. Before giving her an actual allowance, we would find reasons to giver her money to play with or count. &#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yesterday I received $20 to pay for tickets to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>a ballet for another family and left it sitting on my desk.

Its also the age where many kids &quot;steal&quot; things - I mean from an older viewpoint its stealing, but from the child&#39;s pov, he wants it, so its his, right? Its a gap in understanding, not a gap in ethics, per se. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;(He likes to count and exchange his coins  <br/>\n&gt; for $ so he&#39;ll do that with all his change and then a few days later  <br/>\n&gt; he has miraculously found more change to count and exchange)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may be that the change jar strategy is one that doesn&#39;t work so well with this kid. It expects him to do something he can&#39;t, yet, which is keep in mind the needs and wants and wishes of the other family members at the same time as his own - he wants to count and exchange money, its a fascinating game for him. Maybe you can create another way for him to do that, one that doesn&#39;t impinge on others. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re going to talk with the kids (singly or in a group) I&#39;d somehow put the emphasis on the money jar not being such a good idea anymore, not meeting everyone&#39;s needs, rather than making an issue of &quot;stealing&quot;. Its a misunderstanding, like spending the last dollars in the checking account on new shoes, when the phone bill needs to be paid. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I want to trust in our family to know that if I leave  <br/>\n&gt; something out someone isn&#39;t going to take it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It might not be a reasonable assumption! Or not right now, anyway. Again, think in terms of a younger child putting anything and everything in her mouth - you wouldn&#39;t expect to be able to leave certain things lying around. Or a 2yo who loves to climb - you wouldn&#39;t expect that certain kinds of chairs or gates would be &quot;safe&quot; and would be careful around ladders, right? Five is still little! This 5yo isn&#39;t the same as your previous 5yos, so his needs are going to be different, and your strategies will have to be different, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237854017,"authorName":"Dawn Del Rossi","from":"Dawn Del Rossi &lt;dawn@...&gt;","profile":"cddelrossi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"money","postDate":"1262189204","msgId":42596,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4RUY3NEE1LUU0QkUtNEIwRi1CNDkwLTM2MTAyM0EwRDhEQ0B3YXJyZW5idXNpbmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0ZXMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3454,"nextInTopic":42598,"prevInTime":42595,"nextInTime":42597,"topicId":3454,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m typing this quick so my wording may be off and I know we are dealing with all sorts of issues in our house right now with Chris leaving and 5 kids and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-834036519\">I&#39;m typing this quick so my wording may be off and I know we are  <br/>\ndealing with all sorts of issues in our house right now with Chris  <br/>\nleaving and 5 kids and their natural stages but any light or  <br/>\nsuggestions you may be able to shed would be appreciated.  I have a  <br/>\ncontainer that I keep change in.  Whenever the kids have asked for  <br/>\nmoney, I get some from there.  They like to count it out and play with  <br/>\nit, no problem.  They are under the belief it is my money.  I try to  <br/>\ngive the kids money when ever they ask as long as I have it to give  <br/>\nwhen we go to the store or a museum I usually give them say $5 or 10  <br/>\nto spend on whatever they want or they can save it or whatever.  We&#39;ve  <br/>\nalso started giving them an allowance - a dollar for each age.  A few  <br/>\nmonths ago Dominic (our 5 year old) took lots of the change from the  <br/>\ncontainer &quot;without asking.&quot;  The other kids told him he was stealing  <br/>\nthe money and needed to put it back and told me.  I talked to Dominic  <br/>\nand explained that if he felt like he needed any money we could work  <br/>\nsomething out together that he didn&#39;t need to take it.  I let him know  <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t angry at him.  I know he&#39;s taken more of the change since  <br/>\nthen on multiple occasions (He likes to count and exchange his coins  <br/>\nfor $ so he&#39;ll do that with all his change and then a few days later  <br/>\nhe has miraculously found more change to count and exchange) but I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t said anything to him directly.  The issue of taking things  <br/>\nthat don&#39;t belong to you has come up in relation to other things so we  <br/>\nhave talked about it.  Yesterday I received $20 to pay for tickets to  <br/>\na ballet for another family and left it sitting on my desk.  This  <br/>\nmorning it&#39;s gone.  I don&#39;t know what to do about this.  Is it just a  <br/>\nstage that he&#39;ll work out on him own?  Should I talk to him alone?   <br/>\nShould we talk together as a family about it?  If we talk about it how  <br/>\ndo I word it?  I want to trust in our family to know that if I leave  <br/>\nsomething out someone isn&#39;t going to take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, this also happened when I was a kid with my brother.   <br/>\nHe made me an accomplice.  He would &quot;find&quot; money on the road or in the  <br/>\nwoods and then share it with me.  My parents kept a large container  <br/>\nwith change in it that they counted every so often and kept a record  <br/>\nof it.  Until my parents &quot;caught&quot; that money was missing I was naive  <br/>\nas to where my brother got the money, but as soon as they called us on  <br/>\nit, I knew.  They sequestered us together until the guilty culprit  <br/>\nturned himself in - as the case was.  I didn&#39;t tell on my brother but  <br/>\nonce we were alone I told him he had to tell, he would say I was just  <br/>\nas guilty because I had taken the money from him so I had to confess  <br/>\ntoo.  He was uncomfortable, scared, nervous, embarrassed or whatever.   <br/>\nI don&#39;t remember the details of how it ended up working out, how many  <br/>\nminutes/hours it took of us being sequestered before he confessed but  <br/>\nI do remember that it was extremely unpleasant.  I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\npunish all my kids or make them work against each other to &quot;flush&quot; out  <br/>\nwho took the money.  I have said to them all that there was $20 on my  <br/>\ndesk I don&#39;t need to or want to know who took it but that it wasn&#39;t my  <br/>\nmoney and that I would like it returned to the desk and left it at  <br/>\nthat.
