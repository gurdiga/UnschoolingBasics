They&#39;re defective, not like us, and that&#39;s what lets  <br/>\nthem do horrible things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who are biochemically damaged *are* different. But they aren&#39;t  <br/>\n&quot;bad&quot; any more than a person with spinal cord injury is bad for not  <br/>\nwalking. A fetal alcohol damaged person can&#39;t think like a whole  <br/>\nperson. Parts of their brain that are necessary to allow people to  <br/>\nfunction with each other are damaged.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut whole people don&#39;t think murder is better than other dangerous  <br/>\nbut more socially acceptable options like running away.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies can put up a great front for the public and hide horrible  <br/>\nthings behind closed doors. That&#39;s not necessarily true of this  <br/>\nfamily, *but* there was something very broken in the relationship for  <br/>\na healthy child to think murdering her parents was okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it. Really think about it. What would cause you to  <br/>\nmurder? Someone threatening your children? It would have to be  <br/>\nsomething really hugely threatening to overcome all the social and  <br/>\npsychological barriers that say murder is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat in the world was going on with the girl behind closed doors that  <br/>\nallowed her to think murder was a better option than any other to get  <br/>\nher out of the horrible situation?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhole people don&#39;t murder unless they&#39;re pushed to extreme limits, to  <br/>\nthe point where they believe they have no other option in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nParenting isn&#39;t a crap shoot. There&#39;s more to parenting than &quot;doing  <br/>\nthe best we can and hoping for the best.&quot; When we build trusting  <br/>\nrelationships with our kids they will see us as a resource for when  <br/>\nthey&#39;re facing hard decisions and when they&#39;re in a bind. When we  <br/>\ndon&#39;t put up barriers, when they know we&#39;ll help them without  <br/>\njudgement, there isn&#39;t a reason they won&#39;t come to us for advice and  <br/>\nhelp when they&#39;re in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are far fewer reasons to get in trouble when kids know  <br/>\nwe&#39;ll help them explore the world. Unschooled kids don&#39;t need to test  <br/>\nthemselves to see if they really can do what their parents doubt they  <br/>\ncan when their parents are confident that they can do anything they  <br/>\nput their minds to, and the parents are willing to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally. It just doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s not that unschooled children are  <br/>\nsaints. They *will* push their own personal boundaries. (It&#39;s what  <br/>\nhumans do. We&#39;re always testing ourselves to see if we can do  <br/>\nsomething we once couldn&#39;t.) They will try things that we might not  <br/>\nwant them to. But they won&#39;t turn their backs on us and seek  <br/>\nunderstanding from their friends. They won&#39;t turn to things that hurt  <br/>\nthem to prove that they can handle them. If they&#39;re getting  <br/>\nunderstanding and acceptance at home, they don&#39;t need to go elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; She met the boy she is with now two years ago, and after meeting  <br/>\n&gt; him, and seeing that she was mature enough to handle a  <br/>\n&gt; relationship, I did &quot;ALLOW&quot; her to start seeing him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And why do you think your daughter allowed you to decide when she  <br/>\ncould date? That&#39;s a really important question.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, as you&#39;ve seen from lots of posts, and probably have  <br/>\nexperienced in real life, lots and lots of parents who care and worry  <br/>\nand love try the technique of &quot;No, you&#39;re not ready. You can&#39;t until  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s safe for you,&quot; and it&#39;s turned out very very badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Why does the seemingly exact same technique work wonderfully for  <br/>\nyou and turn out bad for others?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is: relationship or, in the absence of trusting  <br/>\nrelationship, personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents *think* they can say no and that will stop the child. As  <br/>\nyou&#39;ve seen, what no does is put a roadblock between the kid and what  <br/>\nthe kid wants. The options are: obedience, working on the parents to  <br/>\nremove the roadblock, sneaking around the roadblock.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect your daughter accepted what you said because either one or  <br/>\nboth: personality and the trusting relationship you&#39;ve established.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What happened to them could have been avoided had their daughter  <br/>\n&gt; respected them, and respected their wishes.<br/>\n&gt; All you talk about is respecting your children, what about their  <br/>\n&gt; respecting their parent. Does that suddenly not matter?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is also a very important point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you *make* someone respect another person?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I meet someone I give them the benefit of the doubt that they&#39;re  <br/>\nprobably deserving of respect. I wouldn&#39;t say I give new people  <br/>\nrespect so much as treat them as though they deserved respect. The  <br/>\nmore I spend time with them, the more I decide if they&#39;re worthy of  <br/>\nactually giving them respect or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could someone *make* me respect them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey can&#39;t. They can act in ways that show they are worth respecting.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s really the only thing anyone can do. But there is nothing they  <br/>\ncan do or say that will *make* me respect them. Respect is something  <br/>\nyou earn. We earn our children&#39;s respect and trust by behaving in  <br/>\nways that are worthy of respect and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my husband out of the blue said flat out no to something -- well,  <br/>\nmy initial reaction would be &quot;WHAT!?!&quot; ;-) -- but if he had to run  <br/>\noff without explaining, I&#39;d trust him because he&#39;s earned my trust  <br/>\nand respect by *being* someone I can trust and respect. But if he  <br/>\nused &quot;No&quot; as a way of  loving and protecting me, he&#39;d lose (or not  <br/>\ngain) my trust and respect because he wasn&#39;t trusting nor respecting me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t know what happened in the family. It may have looked in  <br/>\npublic like they did what we do. But murder is just so far away from  <br/>\nanything trusted and respected children would consider that there had  <br/>\nto either be something going on behind the doors that was very  <br/>\ndifferent from their public face or the girl was very damaged  <br/>\nbiochemically.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Su","postDate":"1181327870","msgId":24270,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTc4MTM0MEFEQjBBRi02MzgtRjIwMkBXRUJNQUlMLU1DMTYuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDM4MDc1Ni42OTUwLnFtQHdlYjM4NTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDM4MDc1Ni42OTUwLnFtQHdlYjM4NTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24238,"nextInTopic":24315,"prevInTime":24269,"nextInTime":24271,"topicId":24238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink teenage girls sneak around on their parents if they&#39;ve learned <br/>\nto trust their parents and their parents&#39; judgement.<br/>\nI doubt that it was a sudden decision. Most parents that care about their children have an age set that that tell their kids they can start dating. Do you seriously think that it was fine for a 13 (at the start of it) year old girl to be dating an 18 year old boy/man? I have always talked with my daughter very openly about dating and she knew that I preferred that she wait until she was at last 16. She met the boy she is with now two years ago, and after meeting him, and seeing that she was mature enough to handle a relationship, I did &quot;ALLOW&quot; her to start seeing him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will concede that controlling parents can be entirely well- <br/>\nintentioned. But they are not building trust; they are not <br/>\ncommunicating respect; they are not being people their children can <br/>\nrespect and whose judgment their children trust.<br/>\nNothing you said before all this had anything to do with the girl in question&#39;s family or the way she was brought up. So why did you even bother with all that? Your situation was alot different from hers. Another person who has made the judgment that these parents were controlling. I will ask you the same question, do you really thing that telling their 13 year old daughter that they did not want her dating an 18 year old was a control issue?? I see it as loving her and caring enough to not let her date, if they felt she wasn&#39;t ready. What 13 year old girl is really mentally ready to pursue a sexual relationship? And how do you even know if the parents didn&#39;t already know that this boy wasn&#39;t stable and didn&#39;t want their daughter to be involved with him?  He was part of their homeschool group, so who knows what they may have already known about him, or what they may have seen. These are thigns that no one will ever know.

What patterns could you possibly see in this case? Patterns from what you have read in the newspaper?
