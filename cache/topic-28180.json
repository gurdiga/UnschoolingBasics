You can unschool and work, even as a single parent,<br/>\nit just might take some extra navigating. I was a single mama for a<br/>\nfew years and managed (somehow!) to keep my daughter home. One option<br/>\nis lots pf great babysitters! My dd had 5, a different one for each<br/>\nday of the week. She loved it and so did her babysitters, they were<br/>\nalways &quot;fresh&quot;. Another thing I found was another single mama that<br/>\nwanted to co-house and swap childcare. Not that these will necessarily<br/>\nwork for you but perhaps it can give you a start. Or at least *know*<br/>\nthat is is possible. I remember reading that many of the parents on<br/>\nhere were/are single and that they managed as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for small children watching &quot;mature&quot; themes in TV, I think its all<br/>\ngood. I have seen &quot;objectional&quot; things on pbs kids shows, I just<br/>\ndialog with my kids about them. My 5 y/o loves Jackass. He also picks<br/>\nup odd, questionable phrases from his big sister and her friends.<br/>\nThat&#39;s life. We work through it. I typically watch things with him, at<br/>\nleast once, and talk about it. It is a fun part of TV watching as I<br/>\nprefer talking to watching, lol. Keep in mind that if you child had a<br/>\nbig sibling he would have probably been exposed to these things<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 3, 2007 11:46 AM, Rebecca De Hate &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rebeccadehate@...\">rebeccadehate@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello unschoolers, I always seem to pop on when I&#39;ve just had an<br/>\n&gt;  argument with my mother.... anyway here&#39;s some questions for you...<br/>\n&gt;  You have probably had them a half a dozen time but..<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  First let me explain myself real quick -- I have thought of<br/>\n&gt;  homeschooling even before my first child was born (he&#39;s 5 now) and<br/>\n&gt;  in the process I&#39;ve still went to school myself for an elementary<br/>\n&gt;  education degree -- basically so I would be &quot;qualified&quot; to teach my<br/>\n&gt;  kids at home but now that I have been introduced to unschooling I<br/>\n&gt;  realize that I don&#39;t have to be &quot;qualified&quot;.

I&#39;m <br/>\nthinking I need to just stop worrying about what she thinks and the <br/>\nschool and allow him to stay home when he feels like it...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second argument with her was that I work and that I can&#39;t <br/>\nhomeschool if I do... I feel that it is possible especially since <br/>\nright now I work at a restaurant and I can work just weekends if <br/>\nneed be plus it seems that the universe will work with me on this if <br/>\nI just open to the possibilities...  <br/>\n<br/>\nthirdly kind of a funny question but am I a bad mom for letting my <br/>\nfive year old watch that dumb austin power goldmember movie.  <br/>\nGranted it isn&#39;t something I let him watch all the time he just <br/>\nthinks it&#39;s funny -- my mom again said it filth and preversion... <br/>\netc, etc.  and after that he talked about his nuts and stuck his <br/>\nmiddle finger up... Now my thoughts are this I can&#39;t shield him from <br/>\neverything and he really doesn&#39;t get all those underlying inuendos <br/>\nthe movie has... second he has talked about the middle finger from <br/>\nthe bus ... and third I think all little boys tend to talk about <br/>\nthere body parts!!??? anyway for now I hid the video so we won&#39;t <br/>\nargure ....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28147,"nextTopicId":28194}}
