We were built to learn! I mean---we&#39;ve been to the <br/>\nMOON!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI want them to be prepared for<br/>\nthe world but I want them to actually learn things<br/>\nrather than just memorize it and forget it.  Which is<br/>\nwhat I did in school.  I don&#39;t know where the balance<br/>\nis either.  I don&#39;t know how to answer my husband.  I<br/>\njust felt like I needed to talk to you.  You had so<br/>\nmany wonderful thoughts and helped me a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks---but mostly that&#39;s because I listened to so many wonderful <br/>\nunschooling moms before me. I listened to my heart. I listened to my <br/>\nchildren. I watched them learn so much so quickly. They do it so <br/>\nnaturally. They are truly amazing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you not see that wonder in your children? Are they not curious, <br/>\ncreative explorers of their world? They are BORN that way! Fantastic <br/>\nlearning creatures!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I may ask...you said &quot;Our unschooling community<br/>\njust lost the THIRD child to death. Jossilyn Adams<br/>\ndied this month.&quot;  What happened to them?  That is<br/>\nscary.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSam Wilkinson (8) died five years ago after falling through the ice <br/>\nwhile ice skating in Maryland. Hannah Jenner (9.5) died of cancer last <br/>\nFebruary in South Dakota. Jossilyn Adams (9) died of cancer this month <br/>\nin Maine. Their moms are all glad they had the time to love and honor <br/>\nthese children through unschooling. They actually got to spend their <br/>\nlives being free and home with their families. What a huge gift their <br/>\nparents gave them!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI love my children very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you do. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to see them as they are NOW <br/>\n---and to see them as the wonderful people they are NOW. Parents spend <br/>\nso much time worrying about who/what their children will become one day <br/>\nthat they totally lose out on who/what their children are TODAY. There <br/>\nis NO guarantee that they will be here tomorrow. Embrace today fully <br/>\nand completely. The shortest path to a happy adulthood is a happy <br/>\nchildhood. YOU have the ability to make them happy children.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much again for the things that you wrote.<br/>\nIt really helped.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it can make a difference in one child&#39;s life!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I know it&#39;s made a difference in many children&#39;s lives. You don&#39;t <br/>\nget a second chance to do it right with your children&#39;s childhoods. <br/>\nIt&#39;s a one time shot. Seriously---they have a LIFETIME to learn math <br/>\nfacts and to read Shakespeare and to to go to Nepal. Not that you <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t expose them to as much as you can. But making them learn <br/>\nthose things because someone thinks it&#39;s necessary---pshaw! They&#39;ll <br/>\ndecide when it&#39;s important. And then it&#39;ll BE important! They won&#39;t be <br/>\nable to help but learn it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve not NEARLY done/learned/seen/experienced everything I want to! I <br/>\nhave the rest of my lifetime too. It&#39;s a good thing I didn&#39;t think all <br/>\nmy learning was done at 18 or 22---hell, I hadn&#39;t even *started*! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

The two <br/>\nthings you mentioned---TV and sodas---maybe he&#39;d be willing to back off <br/>\non those two things a bit. Maybe make smoothies and fruit-sodas (sprite <br/>\nwith cranberry juice or something) instead of so many sodas. Maybe he&#39;d <br/>\nlike to google soft drinks and see the nuritional value. TV---maybe <br/>\nhe&#39;s be willing to do something else with you instead.

On the one hand I can say that I really relate to the fascinating statement that I have heard, as follows: &quot;the opposite of love is not really hate, but fear.&quot;  I think many people, truly striving to be good people, will do things out of fear that they would never consider doing out of hate.  I know much harm was done to me and many I know by well-meaning parents and teachers as we grew up.  And I have seen my anxious parents frighten and intimidate my homeschooled children out of their own fears regarding the kids&#39; futures.  We all fear feeling &#39;negative&#39; emotions (failure, grief, embarrassment, whatever) and will do much to avoid them, even trying to control things far outside our own real sphere of control.
