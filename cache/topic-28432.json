I posted earlier about my 2 year old<br/>\nplaying video games.  (Which is weird enough, on top of the fact that<br/>\nhe will play for hours on end.  He has the attention span people dream<br/>\nabout.  LOL)  The sentence &quot;Did you just see what he did?!?!&quot; Seems to<br/>\nbe exclaimed a LOT around here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, both my children (the older one is 9) have a passion for<br/>\nvideo games.  They are so different, that its nice to see them brought<br/>\ntogether.  However, they now squabble over the controllers and the<br/>\ngames.  He also is having a lot of trouble sharing.  The younger one<br/>\nis very good at the games and does know what he is doing.  He<br/>\ncompletes missions, earns coins, spends coins, and gets around etc.<br/>\netc.  We had to get him his own Gameboy because he was always wanting<br/>\nhis older brothers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose the question is, am I supposed to be getting him his own<br/>\nPlaystation now?  As much as I want him to follow his passions and<br/>\ncontinue learning in this seemingly advanced manner, I just feel weird<br/>\nabout getting my not quite 3 year old a playstation!!!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bright side, since he played all afternoon....  my laundry is done!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28424,"nextTopicId":28443}}
