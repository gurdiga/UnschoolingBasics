Girl Scouts provides programs and incentives that you can<br/>\nchoose to use, or not.  Recently, GSUSA has undergone a huge remodling<br/>\nto focus on promoting building girl leadership.  As a result, there are<br/>\nnow a variety of pathways, some of which are still in development.<br/>\n<br/>\nGirls can choose to join a troop, or not.   They can instead attend<br/>\nprograms independently, or they might join a camp, or the upcoming<br/>\nvirtual option.<br/>\n<br/>\nGSUSA has also developed great new materials that make it easier to<br/>\nencourage girl-driven activities.  There are Journeys for each age level<br/>\nthat will spell things out for you, if you need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, as a leader, your goal is to find out what your girls are<br/>\ninterested in doing.  They may want to do service activities, or outdoor<br/>\nexploration, or crafts, or whatever.   The leader is a facilitator, not<br/>\na director.  In a way, it&#39;s more difficult to back off and let the girls<br/>\nlead, but that&#39;s what make for a great girl scout experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been a GS leader since my daughter was in 1st Grade, and she is<br/>\ngoing into 7th now.

You can&#39;t do extra fund-raising if you don&#39;t do cookie  <br/>\nsales. That&#39;s because the cookie money goes partly to the troop but  <br/>\nalso partly to pay for the organization&#39;s expenses for personnel,  <br/>\ncenters, and camping facilities. The individual troop fundraising  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t contribute to the organization&#39;s expenses. Since we USE the  <br/>\norganization&#39;s facilities extensively - that always seemed totally  <br/>\nfair to me. The difference between Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts is that  <br/>\nBoy Scouts gets LOTS of funding from corporations and grown up boy  <br/>\nscouts who are now CEO&#39;s, etc., of major corporations. Because of the  <br/>\nreality that women are still not commonly found in such positions,  <br/>\nGirl Scouts doesn&#39;t have nearly as much of that kind of funding.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - the cookies are really easy to sell. We don&#39;t usually try to  <br/>\nsell to friends, relatives, neighbors. We just get a &quot;booth sale&quot; slot  <br/>\nat a grocery store or other business. We put the cookies on a table  <br/>\nand the girls stand near the exits and say, &quot;Would you like to buy  <br/>\nsome Girl Scout Cookies?&quot; Lots of people are really thrilled when they  <br/>\nsee Girl Scout Cookies. Their eyes light up. Lots just ignore the  <br/>\ngirls, a handful are rude, most just say no thank you, but, really,  <br/>\nthere are plenty of people who are very very happy to buy them - they  <br/>\nlook FORWARD to them, they say.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Shill&quot; is a pretty strong word to use - it actually means that  <br/>\nsomeone is faking being an eager customer in order to con others into  <br/>\nbuying a product.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you don&#39;t have to sell any particular number of boxes of  <br/>\ncookies. If you sell just one box, that&#39;s considered &quot;participation.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re lucky to have a fund-raiser that is so well-known and set up for  <br/>\nus. We&#39;ve done lots of other fund-raising, over the years, but cookie  <br/>\nsales are definitely the easiest and most lucrative for us. Over the  <br/>\npast two years, my daughter&#39;s troop put a LOT of time into raising  <br/>\nmoney for their cross-country train trip and to spend a week in  <br/>\nManhattan (including six Broadway shows). They collected recyclables,  <br/>\nthey put on a whole bunch of drop-off babysitting events (Drop and  <br/>\nShop - near a mall, during November and December, for example). They  <br/>\nhad garage sales. They sold magazine subscriptions. Cookie sale money  <br/>\nswamped all the rest of the fund-raising put together.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the girls were younger, many of them LOVED standing out and  <br/>\nselling cookies at the stores. The girls who didn&#39;t want to do it  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t do it. We always made it completely optional.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur expenses were very minimal with younger girls. We usually had dues  <br/>\n- something like $1 per meeting for the younger girls. That was enough  <br/>\nto cover the cost of supplies. Parents volunteered to bring snacks.  <br/>\nCookie sale money would be used for specific activities or events.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the girls get older, you can keep track of their fundraising  <br/>\nindividually - so my daughter raised enough through cookie sales and  <br/>\nthe other fund-raising activities to have about $500 credit toward our  <br/>\ntrip this year. Other girls might have had more or less.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about the whole process of having the kids raise money  <br/>\nfor their own activities. There are pros and cons to it, imo. It can  <br/>\nclearly be taken too far, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. To some degree,  <br/>\nthe kids tend to enjoy it - my girls used to make up funny jingles and  <br/>\nstand and sing in front of the stores when selling cookies. They had a  <br/>\nblast. We&#39;d never do it if it wasn&#39;t enjoyable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But, also, there was something more - something more difficult to  <br/>\nput a name on. There is a holistic nature to a well-run program - the  <br/>\ngirls decide what they want to do, plan it, get together whatever is  <br/>\nneeded, including raising money for it, and do it. They don&#39;t do all  <br/>\nof those things all by themselves, of course, but they have some level  <br/>\nof involvement in them all. It is different than just &quot;showing up&quot; and  <br/>\nhaving an activity all planned out and ready. That can be good, too,  <br/>\nbut the ones that the girls have worked toward, themselves, really  <br/>\nseem to be more valuable to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf all I said above sound like a defense of Girl Scouts, I should say  <br/>\nthat if I had it to do over again, though, we&#39;d probably have moved  <br/>\ntoward more involvement in 4H and maybe not done Girl Scouts. We did  <br/>\ndo 4H for about 4 years - mostly horse stuff, but also some other  <br/>\nprojects. I really think that the way it is organized is awesome for  <br/>\nunschoolers. In 4H you pick what you&#39;re interested in (or offer what  <br/>\nyou have expertise in) and you meet with a group to work on that  <br/>\nparticular interest. You do meet with the entire club, usually once a  <br/>\nmonth for a meeting and other times for service projects or other  <br/>\ngroup activities. But, anyway, I like the way it is all organized  <br/>\naround experiential learning and exploring new interests and  <br/>\nsupporting existing interests. The 4H projects can be pretty much  <br/>\nanything - I started out thinking it was all animal-related, but, no,  <br/>\nI ended up running a drama project and my daughter did photography,  <br/>\nleather working, arts and crafts, gardening, and much more. Mostly she  <br/>\nwas there for the horsemanship, so that was our focus.

We met in a church, which was really weird for me, but after a while the atmosphere faded into the background. I don&#39;t think I was an unschooler back then, but the troop was definitely open and expereimental. I had no clue what I was doing so I just brought a lot of stuff from home (dress up stuff, paint, clay, puppets, our cat, etc.) and we played a lot. We also had a camp out and planted some flowers for a park in the neighborhood. We put on a play (entirely improvisational) for the parents. I remember also getting together with another troop for a car wash. We ate snacks and chatted. We did what we wanted to do, with the exception of singing one song at the end of every meeting that was sort of &quot;required&quot; I guess. (&quot;Make new friends, but keep the old, one is silver and the other gold.&quot;)&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it can be whatever you want it to be, with the girls&#39; input. My daughter, who was five years old when I had the daisy troop, was full of great ideas for things to do, and some of the other moms and daughters also gave suggestions. I don&#39;t know if I agree with Melissa, unless you find yourself dealing with the &quot;Little League&quot; kind of parent who has some rigid expectations of what you&#39;re doing. Maybe send out a little flyer to the parents beforehand letting them know that this is not going to be an achievement oriented thing, but a fun get together and work together time for you and the girls.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Angela<br/>\nPS Sorry to any cool Little League parents out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 7/15/08, Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Girl Scouts<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, July 15, 2008, 5:12 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience?
