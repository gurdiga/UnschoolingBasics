Personally I read very very young and voraciously, and I have some of those same expectations for Finn.  ~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExpectations can really get in the way of the natural unfolding a person needs to do.

Messages about when a child &quot;should&quot; learn to read come from schools, one of the most unnatural institutions to ever exist (in their current form). Is the concern that he won&#39;t read if it&#39;s not by a certain age? Is the concern about judgment from other people? What is the true concern? People don&#39;t go around talking about when they started reading or tying their shoes or riding a bike as a method to judge their current capabilities once they&#39;re adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~~I am excited for my son to have access to that same world of learning and imagination.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he learns to read early, then he loses other kinds of learning and imagination. Some people&#39;s learning and imagination are totally tied to reading early, other people have different forms of learning and imagination and it would be stifled if they read &quot;early&quot;. Be excited for him to unfold in his own way and time because THAT is a rare gift in this world! Be excited for your child to have access to learning and imagination of his own variety, in which reading will become a part when he&#39;s good and ready and not before.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~Here&#39;s my question: I&#39;d like to get some sort of grip on when  unschooled kids typically start reading.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d guess later than most, in general. Because we don&#39;t push and prod and say &quot;look, he&#39;s reading&quot; when a child reads 2-3 words or stumbles around a simple child-reader book that is dumbed down. Trust means that children read when it&#39;s comfortable, in their own unique way at whatever age they become capable of decoding. Out of four children I have one that started at 8-9, one at 12, one at 6-7 and my youngest is currently just beginning to recognize a few letters at age 8.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guarantee you can&#39;t tell who read first, or better or fastest when they&#39;re 20 years old. Heck, you can&#39;t tell with my three reading children and Jared (who started at 12 and is now almost 16) has the least experience yet reads as good as any adult I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~I need some reassurance that letting Finn read when he&#39;s ready won&#39;t result in him simply never being ready.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nFind me a grown unschooled kid who is illiterate. Just one. A single ONE would crash all my theories and trust. I don&#39;t know of one...anywhere, ever. I know of some schooled kids who think they&#39;re dumb and developmentally &quot;delayed&quot; and even some who grow up illiterate. Find me a single illiterate person who did not go to school! Just one. They all started out in school and decided they weren&#39;t intelligent, capable human beings at some point and gave up. That&#39;s what the system can do to some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine Jared (16) would have had tremendous pressure and destructive labels had he struggled with reading in school. Thank goodness he was free to learn in his own time and does not think it weird or strange that he learned to read at 12 instead of 6. Prescribed time tables for learning are false and not based on human development at ALL. Trusting your child means letting go of &quot;norms&quot; and time tables and simply being with them, in their own learning journey. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Reading","postDate":"1249566955","msgId":40929,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg1ZW5kYitsOWU4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg0NjkyODc1MS0xMjQ5NTA1MDU2LWNhcmRodV9kZWNvbWJvYnVsYXRvcl9ibGFja2JlcnJ5LnJpbS5uZXQtMTY0MDYwODk0LUBieGUxMjkxLmJpc3gucHJvZC5vbi5ibGFja2JlcnJ5Pg=="},"prevInTopic":40914,"nextInTopic":40937,"prevInTime":40928,"nextInTime":40930,"topicId":40875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************************ When Mo was younger she enjoyed stencils of all kinds - shapes and letters and numbers.

It is exciting to get gifts so<br/>\nthey do really love to wait.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: Last year we were in the middle of 5 months of travel when her birthday<br/>\ncame along, and she was not really aware of it as an &quot;event&quot;... an uncle<br/>\nwhom we were visiting got a cake, and some plastic leis and we sang...it<br/>\nmade a big impression on maya and she now asks for birthday songs all the<br/>\ntime....so we do lots of &quot;pretend birthdays&quot;...sticking a candle in a<br/>\npancake, piece of bread or whatever is around and singing...<br/>\n<br/>\n***excellent fun! We have done that a lot around here too! I am looking<br/>\nforward to it again as the littlest is nearing her 2nd birthday and may be<br/>\nswept off her feet :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: Looking for a way to make this special and different, also I will be<br/>\ngiving birth about 2 weeks before her birthday so whatever we do needs to be<br/>\nfairly low key...probably a gathering of 4 or 5 close friends in a park.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It can be anything that you and she want. It can be low key or a huge<br/>\nparty. What are you feeling up to, what does she want? Sometimes she might<br/>\nwant to make huge plans but not actually go through with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: Lastly, for families who do not do a big gift thing, how do your kids<br/>\nfeel when they go to big parties with tons of gifts....or do i just cross<br/>\nthat bridge when i get there? Thanks for the input and ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\n***We don&#39;t do a huge slew of gifts. We have once when a child needed that<br/>\nbut it isn&#39;t typical. NOne of my children (12, 6 & 22 months) has ever been<br/>\nbothered by the amount of gifts they received or another child received in<br/>\nfront of them. My ds6 can be sad when he doesn&#39;t get things at parties so we<br/>\nalways have something for him too (we give all the kids a small gift to<br/>\ncelebrate a sibs birthday) or talk to him before and make plans with him to<br/>\nhandle it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Ideas for special birthday celebrations","postDate":"1249499455","msgId":40909,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwODA1MTIxMHljZGMzZmQ3cTkxZWZhNmFlMDMxMWMyNzlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg1NWFtditzbWFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg1NG9zNStja3NlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aDU1YW12K3NtYWNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40908,"nextInTopic":40910,"prevInTime":40908,"nextInTime":40910,"topicId":40875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well Meredith already pointed you towards my blog.

That&#39;s Easy&#39;s birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalila has had a variety of birthday party styles. She is very social and<br/>\nwanted BIG parties growing up. We had not huge but well attended parties<br/>\nwith themes and bells and whistles (figuratively and literally). We had a<br/>\nHarry Potter themed party for her 10.5 birthday (Her birthday is new year&#39;s<br/>\neve...) So we invited a bunch of kids and adults that loved Harry Potter. We<br/>\nmade stations of potions, spells, fortune telling, etc. We had games and a<br/>\nUmbridge pinata (who wouldn&#39;t want to smack the crap out of her) and a<br/>\ntreasure hunt. I seriously went all out. Everyone came in costume. It<br/>\nrocked.<br/>\nFor her 11th birthday she went to the midnight showing of Rocky Horror with<br/>\nher papa and two friends. They slept over and had fun food. It was low key.<br/>\nThis year 12th birthday was 3 friends and a sleep over. The biggest request<br/>\nwas spray whip cream :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMalila celebration blogs<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2009/01/malilas-12th-birthday.html\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2009/01/malilas-12th-birthday.html</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2008/10/tis-season.html\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/2008/10/tis-season.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor the baby we did what the older two wanted. A small but lively party with<br/>\na few friends of all ages. Cake, pinata and presents. Not too many but<br/>\neveryone was happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds (6) talks about what he is going to do for his birthday ALL year long!<br/>\nHe has elaborate plans that change constantly. It is amazing to hear. Many<br/>\nwe write down :-) This year he didn&#39;t really want a party just a &quot;pool full<br/>\nof candy&quot; so we did what we could! This year he wants a Lamborghini, lol. I<br/>\nsmile and talk about how cool that is. One year he wanted TMNT to come meet<br/>\nhim. His sister dressed up like on and hung out with him. It was really<br/>\ncool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe go raspberry picking every year for my husbands birthday.

Mo, however, dislikes being read to and always has - and yet she learned to read around 4.5.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra went through several years of not liking anyone reading to her. She was ready for longer books, but couldn&#39;t comprehend when someone read to her. Children&#39;s picture books were ok, but nothing else. This year (she&#39;s 12, started reading fluently around 6-7) she suddenly discovered reading for pleasure. She read Skellig and LOVED it and is currently reading another chapter book. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy two older boys don&#39;t read for pleasure, they read to get information. Jared will read these very complicated manuals and Dungeons and Dragons books that make my head spin...that&#39;s fun for him but he doesn&#39;t read novels or stories. Trust goes a long way in allowing each person&#39;s journey to unfold. Whether we&#39;re talking about reading or anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here need a dose of encouragement that unschooling is absolutely the best thing for your child, just check out this video I posted at my blog.

I&#39;m 57 now (so it is my <br/>\n50th anniversary of year for reading). Back in my early school days, it <br/>\nwas considered bad for children for them to read earlier than 7, so I <br/>\nwas actively prevented from learning to read. I remember asking my mom <br/>\nand dad questions (what is this word?) and them exchanging a &quot;look&quot; and <br/>\nputting me off. I remember sitting outside, kind of hidden away from the <br/>\nhouse, with a picture book that had just one picture and a word on each <br/>\npage and I was trying to figure out the code. I had figured out &quot;P&quot; and <br/>\n&quot;A&quot; and &quot;M&quot; because of my name and, after &quot;A is for Apple&quot; the next word <br/>\nwsa &quot;B is for Book.&quot; I remember the feeling of &quot;I GOT IT!!!&quot; I <br/>\nunderstood that each letter was going to have its own sound and I <br/>\nthought I just had to learn all those sounds in order to read. So I sat <br/>\nout there in the sun, feeling guilty, learning the sounds of all the <br/>\nletters. Interestingly, I still couldn&#39;t read. They didn&#39;t used to <br/>\nactually teach reading until 2nd grade and the very first day of second <br/>\ngrade I thought the teacher would FINALLY explain it. But, no, a few <br/>\nweeks went by while all we did was letter sounds, again (did it in 1st <br/>\ngrade, too). FINALLY the big books came out and Dick and Jane became my <br/>\nfavorite people in the world. Talk about ready to read - I was so happy <br/>\nthat it was &quot;legal&quot; for me to learn!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters each learned in their own way, at their own time.

You should be able to find both at the public library or on amazon for a decent price.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is &quot;Dumbing us Down&quot; by John Taylor Ghatto.  He talks about what public school is really teaching our children (it works, it just doesn&#39;t do what everyone wants it to do --scary) and has a section in there where talks about how, when a child is ready to learn reading, writing and arithematic (not a set age by his standards either), that learning ALL of the above takes less than 100 hours total time as opposed to 6-12+ years of schooling.  Very interesting book and a good read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second doesn&#39;t follow the unschooling style outright, but is a method that starts out VERY unschool-ish and even when it progresses to higher levels (or more hours) of learning, is still VERY much child-led and mentor-ship based.  Lots of parental modelling, and it explains that children have to learn to understand and use language first, that the formal reading and writing can come later when they are ready or need that, and as long as they can think and speak appropriately, it&#39;ll come at whatever age they are ready.  Here I am going on and on about a book I haven&#39;t told you the title of!  It&#39;s called &quot;A Thomas Jefferson Education&quot; by Oliver DeMille.  It is actually the style of homeschooling we will be following, but in our society, I need the &quot;Unschooling&quot; reinforcement to let go of the nonesense that&#39;s been pushed upon me for years and we truly are unschooling right now with lots of parental modeling (which is what it is!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck!  I honestly wouldn&#39;t worry about it.  Having come from the situation of having a bad reading experience in school early on (and I never had a problem reading) and then not reading a from 2nd grade through to my Junior Year of high school, I&#39;m more concerned about forcing the issue or causing negative feelings in my children.

I just <br/>\nlooked up the normal age for children to begin walking - the charts say <br/>\n9 months to 18 months. That is a HUGE range (a kid walking at 18 months <br/>\nold is TWICE as old as a kid walking at 7 months), and it isn&#39;t even big <br/>\nenough. My youngest daughter started walking when she was 7 months old - <br/>\nand I mean really walking, not holding onto anything, not just taking a <br/>\nstep or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same thing is true of reading - when kids are allowed to learn on <br/>\ntheir own internal timetable, the range of normal development is huge - <br/>\n3 years old to 16 years old are the most extreme ends I&#39;ve heard of. It <br/>\nis my impression that most unschooled kids learn to read between 5 and <br/>\n10, which is pretty much the same as when most kids in school learn to <br/>\nread. But MANY learn to read earlier or later than that and the <br/>\ndifference between unschoolers and school is that we support that <br/>\nlearning WHEN it happens instead of trying to force it to happen on our <br/>\nschedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs unschoolers, we aren&#39;t trying to delay or speed up reading, but it is <br/>\nhelpful to recognize the advantages of delayed reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot-yet-reading does NOT mean not-yet-learning, of course, and it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to even mean not-yet-learning from books, right? Kids can <br/>\nbe read to and can listen to books long before they start reading <br/>\nindependently. My own observation of a number of much-later readers is <br/>\nthat they develop listening skills that are extremely valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne always-unschooled young man I know did not read independently until <br/>\nhe was about 12 or 13 years old. He recently took my college economics <br/>\ncourses and he was the first student ever (in my 35 years of college <br/>\nteaching) to completely ace one of my classes - 100 percent on every <br/>\nexam.  He was able to sit and listen to lectures and absorb and <br/>\nunderstand it all. The contrast between his ability to learn by <br/>\nlistening versus that of other college students was very great! When he <br/>\nwas growing up, not-yet-reading, he was read to by the hour, listened to <br/>\nbooks on tape/cd a lot, and watched probably hundreds of videos of all <br/>\nkinds. By the time he started reading independently, he was already <br/>\nextremely &quot;well read.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider not putting so much emphasis on reading books independently - <br/>\nit isn&#39;t as big a deal as the educational experts have convinced us it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI, by the way, haven&#39;t read many books in the last few years because my <br/>\neyesight is very poor. I have listened to hundreds of books, however, <br/>\nand I have discovered that I get much more out of listening to books <br/>\nthan reading them in print.

The &quot;normal&quot; range for learning to read is really wide: anywhere from 4 to 13 - seriously. Reading requires an assortment of skills, and not all of those will develop at the same time/rate. Looking around your family can give you some clues as to what to expect. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to never being ready - reading, in many ways, is an &quot;adult&quot; skill. Its not the sort of thing that&#39;s learned better for learning early, if anything, the opposite is more likely true. What hampers people who read later is years of being told there&#39;s something wrong with them for not being able to read. I used to teach reading to adults, and self esteem was The biggest hurdle. So the best thing you can do for a later reader is reassure him or her that s/he Will one day read, while being available to read anything at all for him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":146052230,"authorName":"Sacha Davis","from":"Sacha Davis &lt;sacha@...&gt;","profile":"sacha_pie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Reading","postDate":"1249309716","msgId":40884,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERDQThFNkJGLTdGNTEtNEZGQi1BMzM1LTYxOTg0RkJBNzg3OUBkcml6emxlLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg1NWFtditzbWFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg1NWFtditzbWFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40883,"nextInTopic":40885,"prevInTime":40883,"nextInTime":40885,"topicId":40875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all - I m new to this group and have been enjoying lurking and reading the discussion.

When the kids were little, we <br/>\nstarted a very cool tradition. Each night, we draw names. The next day, <br/>\nwe try to do nice things for the person whose name we&#39;ve drawn, but <br/>\nwithout them figuring out who is doing these nice things. The next <br/>\nnight, we try to each guess who had our name that day. We also gave <br/>\nlittle small presents to the kids each night - I&#39;m talking about little <br/>\ntiny gifts - a few dollars at most. We also found special ways to be <br/>\nhelpful to other people during those days, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother holiday we have is the longest night of the year - we stay up <br/>\nall night, have a fire in the fireplace, don&#39;t have computers or tv on, <br/>\nand my husband tells stories (the old legends of Iran).

On an emotional level I mean. Probably you are working a lot of that into your daily life, making every day a celebration! So the idea of family traditions may be something that&#39;s about you, about your memories and needs, but not your kids needs. I&#39;m not saying to ditch the idea, but if you see that its about you, not your kids, you can look for ways to meet your own needs, perhaps differently than you&#39;d otherwise envisioned. You might also look at the traditions that are forming, slowly and naturally, in your own family. My family traditions don&#39;t look anything like what I might have imagined beforehand, because I couldn&#39;t have guessed how my family would grow and change. More of my family traditions are kid-driven and transitory, too. They last until the kid who starts the tradition outgrows it, and by then we have new traditions. Its not what I was raised to expect of Tradition! but it fits our family well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Looking for a way to make this special and different, also I will be giving birth about 2 weeks before her birthday so whatever we do needs to be fairly low key...probably a gathering of 4 or 5 close friends in a park.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it even need to be that much?

It was enough of a &quot;party&quot; for her dd, and took a minimum of prep and stress. Her dd actively wanted a party, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also plan a party before the birth, rather than fuss over the exact day - or have a party before and after if you like!
