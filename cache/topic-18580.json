But I&#39;m not going to argue about it.. I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to encourage him to change but if he doesn&#39;t whose it hurting -<br/>\n- no one. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote:  Spazzzz , even offered to help... nope  spazz -- mom blows <br/>\nonce more -spanks (Mind you, I&#39;m sure the drive <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in guy thinks i&#39;m just killing my kid -- because he&#39;s screaming -<br/>\n&gt; which he was doing way before I even spanked.... still wrong <br/>\n </span></blockquote>answer <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I know...) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thinking now:  Someone wrote on this group that spanking -is Hitting <br/>\nand that should never happen.  That person is right.  Lately when I <br/>\nstart to even think about spanking I think to myself -- &quot;I&#39;m going <br/>\nto hit you..&quot; WRONG. One time I even did the classic threat -- &quot;If <br/>\nyou don&#39;t stop I&#39;m going to spank you&quot;  NOPE Later I even told my <br/>\nson that I was wrong to say that, because spanking is hitting and I <br/>\nask him not to hit so I shouldn&#39;t........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMORE THOUGHTS:<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I&#39;m recoginizing more and more that I am setting the tone <br/>\nfor the household. If I&#39;m snappy and grumpy, how are my kids going <br/>\nto act?  This one is a hard one to swallow but true.  Lately, are <br/>\nhousehold is running much smoother because I&#39;m slowly learning to <br/>\nstop and think before I react.  My children are a blessing and I <br/>\nwant to have a peaceful household and it starts with me.  When I was <br/>\nlast having my pity party I was crying about it being just me -- but <br/>\nin a more positive light -- at least I don&#39;t have to battle a <br/>\npartner that doesn&#39;t understand unschooling.....  <br/>\n<br/>\nMore accomplishments (I think):<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  when my oldest has insisted he doesn&#39;t need a coat or hat, etc.  <br/>\nI honor his decision and usually now he&#39;s been asking for his coat <br/>\nto be zipped up, or a hat, or gloves all on his own.  (so what if my <br/>\nmom thinks this is awful, I believe my child is smart enough to <br/>\nrealize when he is cold and will fix the problem (he&#39;s 4))<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  On Halloween my son decided to take his clothes off and just <br/>\nwhere his scoby doo outfit with just underwear and socks.  I did try <br/>\nto explain that he really need clothes underneath because it was <br/>\ncold, but he started to argue -- so I just said ok. to say the least <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t get to far before he wanted to head home and he was cold.  <br/>\nBut when he started to become upset because he wanted in the <br/>\nstroller instead of his gator, I just asked him to hold on a minute <br/>\nand I got a blanket and put it around him....<br/>\nthe only thing I think I could have left out was the &quot;I told you <br/>\nso...&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The other morning when he asked for fritos for &#39;breakfast&#39; I <br/>\nsaid ok and even went and got them for him.  Why not?  Like someone <br/>\npointed out does it matter if he eats them in the morning or late <br/>\nafternoon?  When I was laughing about this with my mom -- of course <br/>\nI got the &quot;oh, Rebecca&quot; from her.. but I just told her &quot;does it <br/>\nreally matter?&quot;  Of course her rebuttal was &quot;depends on what he ate <br/>\nthe rest of the day&quot; --- Does it???? I basically don&#39;t make a big <br/>\ndeal out of meals.  We eat when were hungry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo folks, I believe I&#39;m starting to come around to the unschooling <br/>\nthoughts and I&#39;m working on being more mindful towards my kids (and <br/>\neveryone for that matter) everyday. The biggest thing I kick myself <br/>\nabout now is my quickness to yell.  Even today my son said to <br/>\nme &quot;you can&#39;t holler at me I&#39;m being nice to you&quot; (something I have <br/>\nsaid similarly to him before) and all I could say was &quot;your right, <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  I hope I made sense and I know this was a pretty long <br/>\nmessage to sort through.

Otherwise just let <br/>\nhim wear what he wants... no biggy especially at his age.. people just <br/>\nassume he dressed himself.. which he did.  As for hats and gloves just take <br/>\nthem with you.. he will ask for them pretty quick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAll-in-one security and maintenance for your PC.

Anyway, today <br/>\nis a day when I&#39;m feeling like &quot;why bother&quot;.  It seems that no <br/>\nmatter what I do my son (4) is going to give me a road block. Now in <br/>\nreality I know its all me.  For example... a couple of weeks ago I <br/>\nwas going to take my nephew to school and the night before I asked <br/>\nIan if he wanted to stay home in the morning with the babysitter or <br/>\ngo with me.. well he said me.Cool. but that morning all hell broke <br/>\nloose.  (me again) because I wanted Ian to change his &#39;painted&#39;pants <br/>\nin case we went out afterwards (ok I&#39;m worrying what other people <br/>\nwill think -- bad...) So I thought if I helped him he would be ok -- <br/>\nnope.. long story short I lost it, hollered a little spanked, etc.  <br/>\nHowever, I did take him to mc&#39;d&#39;s later and all was well. Except my, <br/>\ngeez, I could&#39;ve handled the whole morning differently.  I could <br/>\nhave just left the stinkin&#39; painted pants up -- who really cares and <br/>\nif they do oh well.  But then again today same scenario promised my <br/>\nnephew I would take him to school.  All right, this time I won&#39;t <br/>\neven wake up Ian, I won&#39;t worry about what he&#39;s wearing at the <br/>\nmoment I&#39;ll just lay him down in the car wrapped in cozy blanket and <br/>\ntake the spare set of clothes with me (because geez somebody (like <br/>\nmy mother) may realize he&#39;s in the same pants as yesterday -gasp -- <br/>\ncan&#39;t have that).  All is well, proud of myself no craziness <br/>\nleaving. but listen there&#39;s more... get to Mc Donalds and ask him to <br/>\nput on the different clothes or we weren&#39;t going in (hmmm. could <br/>\nthis been the wrong words???) Spazzzz , even offered to help... nope <br/>\nspazz -- mom blows once more -spanks (Mind you, I&#39;m sure the drive <br/>\nin guy thinks i&#39;m just killing my kid -- because he&#39;s screaming -<br/>\nwhich he was doing way before I even spanked.... still wrong answer <br/>\nI know...) <br/>\n   Later it&#39;s time to go to Aunt Shel&#39;s just down the road -- to <br/>\nrake outside -- so ok no prob. but you need socks and coat, hat, <br/>\netc..  minor dilemma&#39;s but he puts stuff on. but just before were <br/>\ngoing out the door to walk him down - spazz.. throws off hat/mask <br/>\n(which he put on) and gloves we just put on because it&#39;s hard to <br/>\nopen door... the ever mature mom whops him on the head with the hats <br/>\nin my hand and causes more tantrum -- makes him go outside and go to <br/>\naunt shel&#39;s -- in between trying to get him to look at me and trying <br/>\nto hold him -- looks like I&quot;M doing who knows what and sounding like <br/>\na lunatic i&#39;m sure.  (so wonder why he won&#39;t listen to me at this <br/>\npoint????)  <br/>\n<br/>\nok believe it or not working towards unschooling but how the heck do <br/>\nI unschool myself.  It seems the more I work on joyful living, <br/>\npeacefulness, etc I revert back to the old.  I swear, I scream, <br/>\nspank, what the heck...  ALL NEGATIVE. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s my pity party, it&#39;s just me. single mom of 2. 4years old <br/>\nand 7 month old.  no one to retrieve me -- monies running out, <br/>\nstress over money, expected the ex-boyfriend to maybe step up to the <br/>\nplate and help and help me to work only part time (now he&#39;s the ex --<br/>\n for a reason)  my mom thinks the ex- is why Ian and I battled but <br/>\nthe truth is battle is always here... me.... I don&#39;t get to stay <br/>\nhome like these other unschoolers and just enjoy..now i have to go <br/>\nlook for a job and be away from my boys -- hating it.. <br/>\n<br/>\ncan you all see where my mind is going..  Basically after all this <br/>\nranting... HOW do I unschool myself from all this old patterns? It <br/>\nisn&#39;t my children&#39;s fault I&#39;m stressed.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18758,"nextTopicId":18764}}
