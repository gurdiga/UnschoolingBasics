I have always found it to be very helpful to talk to the older ones about what is developmentally appropriate for the younger ones. I also commiserate with them and let the older ones know that I am listening to them. We try to find ways of keeping the important stuff away from the little ones. Sometimes that means that we deliberately &quot;hide&quot; or put things where the younger ones can&#39;t get it. When my oldest wants or needs privacy, she will go hide in the bathroom and lock the door. She will take a shower or sit and read her books. I also try to explain to the younger ones that their big sisters needs some space. I try to involve the older ones in finding ways of protecting their stuff. I talk to the older ones about what they were like when they were younger. It&#39;s funny because we were talking about this when my niece was with us the other day. She reminded me how she got into my finger nail polish and painted my wall when she was younger. My girls really look up to their cousin so it helped them to hear that she &quot;got into stuff&quot; when she was little. It has helped them be a lot more understanding with the younger ones. Little kids get into stuff, it is really very normal.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tonight, my oldest is spending the night with her older cousin and will be going out with her cousins tomorrow. The younger ones are not happy about it. I have had to explain to them that their big sister needs space. They still aren&#39;t happy about it but we are trying to find fun things to do with them so they don&#39;t think about their big sister being gone. They aren&#39;t trying to be mean. They love their big sister and want to be with her all the time. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do try to talk to my oldest about playing with the younger ones proactively but the older kids can sometimes experience burn out too. They didn&#39;t get to choose to have younger siblings. Think about the times that you get burnt out and need space. As an adult, it is easy to understand that it isn&#39;t always possible to get that space. Older siblings often get stuck in a position of always being the one to give in and accommodate the younger siblings. I have been talking with some of my family members to try to find more ways to get my oldest daughter out and about and away from her sisters so that she can recharge her batteries and not have to worry about being the big sister. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It helps a lot, in terms of not taking things your kids do personally, to assume positive intent. That&#39;s surprisingly difficult because we&#39;re bombarded with messages about kids sneaking and lying and cheating and trying to control us. Whenever you notice yourself assuming kids are doing things for a negative reason, take a moment to step back and think of one other reason, a kinder reason.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is huge! This is something that we are always working on as a family. Whenever one of us assumes something negative, we (as a family) try to find the positive. When my 6 year old can&#39;t find her DS, she will sometimes get very upset and assume that somebody stole it or hid it from her. Sometimes, she can&#39;t find it because I took it away from her little sister and put it where it won&#39;t get messed up. My 6 year old doesn&#39;t always remember to put stuff where her little sisters can&#39;t get it. Her little sister (20 months old) will sometimes pick up the DS because she sees everyone else play with it. It is more out of curiosity than anything else. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Connie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"The Coffee Goddess","from":"The Coffee Goddess &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: respecting big brother&#39;s belongings/space","postDate":"1287941079","msgId":45002,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgxNDAxOC45MDIyMC5xbUB3ZWIxMTMyMDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDkxOEU5RjQyODIzODQ5NzM4MTk3OEIyMkMxOEM4N0JBQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk5dm9wcCs3OXQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTE4RTlGNDI4MjM4NDk3MzgxOTc4QjIyQzE4Qzg3QkFAQ29ubmllUEM+"},"prevInTopic":45000,"nextInTopic":45782,"prevInTime":45001,"nextInTime":45003,"topicId":44991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was going to make a suggestion like this as well... ...

I have an 18 yo, a 12.5,  yo, and a 2.5yo.  My big kids are VERY sweet <br/>\nwith their little sister, and she&#39;s in turn very sweet with them.  They know to <br/>\nput up their special things, and that she wouldn&#39;t purposefully hurt them, and <br/>\nthey each have favorite games they like to play with her, so that when she <br/>\nwanders into their rooms they greet her with a smile and start in with calling <br/>\nher puppy and offering her a bone, or singing a song with her that is &quot;their <br/>\nthing&quot; together.  Whatever.  But they connect and she loved them and she moves <br/>\non.  She&#39;s not trying to get their attention, they give it freely to her and she <br/>\nhas all the love she needs.  Because of this we have zero battles.  We had about <br/>\n10 unschooled teens (er, 7 unschooled teens and 3 schooled teens) over for a <br/>\nsleep over last night, and they were all sweet to and included the two year old, <br/>\nand she would play with them for a while, then with papa, then with another mama <br/>\nwho was visiting, then with mama, then asked to go to sleep.  Everyone from 2.5 <br/>\nto 4o-something had a great time at the same party and no one had any feelings <br/>\nof not being wanted :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDana<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: respecting big brother&#39;s belongings/space","postDate":"1287924974","msgId":45000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlhMWFkZStwdjUwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk5dXRoYitmNWxiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44999,"nextInTopic":45002,"prevInTime":44999,"nextInTime":45001,"topicId":44991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Get the 14-year-old a lock.

From your younger kids&#39; perspective, they don&#39;t &quot;think&quot; what they&#39;re doing is a game, they are really playing a game! Its not personal or deliberately mean, although it can become that way if they&#39;re accused of being cruel over and over. Its better, as Schuyler pointed out, to both spend more time playing with them and help your older son find a way to maintain his privacy. On top of that, though, talk with your 14yo. Let him know that his brothers are doing this because they want to play with him. The more he can take time to play with them proactively, the better the chances of them letting him have some personal space without it being a giant battle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying so hard to be a better, more even tempered mother, to respect their autonomy and their individual needs and personalities but I do think that there needs to be some respect for the needs and personal space of others as well.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so this is more of a thought exercise for you - how often, in recent months, have you &quot;stolen&quot; and/or &quot;hidden&quot; something from the perspective of a 5 and 6 year old? If your first response is &quot;none&quot; think again! Have you gone through a room and picked up toys, put dirty clothes in the hamper, stacked things neatly out of the way without asking if it was okay with your kids? From an adult perspective, that&#39;s just normal housework, but to a young child - the sweater was Here and now its Gone... but mom knows where it is... did she steal it? Is this some weird grown-up game to learn? What&#39;s going on? <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the perspective of young children, adults do a Lot of weird, incomprehensible things without ever explaining them. But that doesn&#39;t need you need to &quot;explain&quot; everything you do ad nauseum! Do communicate your intentions, though. Invite your kids into your world - I&#39;m picking up dirty clothes, anyone want to help? If they say No, at least they know a little more about what&#39;s going on in their world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps a lot, in terms of not taking things your kids do personally, to assume positive intent. That&#39;s surprisingly difficult because we&#39;re bombarded with messages about kids sneaking and lying and cheating and trying to control us. Whenever you notice yourself assuming kids are doing things for a negative reason, take a moment to step back and think of one other reason, a kinder reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, probably the most Common reason for kids to do things that drive adults and teens bonkers is they want attention - and that&#39;s something that&#39;s often framed as a negative. Turn it around - human beings need other human beings. We all need attention. Kids need a lot of it! And they depend on their parents to get it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a cute, somewhat tongue-in-cheek graph showing how much time to spend with kids of different ages, if you&#39;re looking for a baseline:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/howto/\">http://sandradodd.com/howto/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":401964735,"authorName":"yarnmama@rocketmail.com","from":"&quot;yarnmama@...&quot; &lt;yarnmama@...&gt;","profile":"yarnmama@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: respecting big brother&#39;s belongings/space","postDate":"1287858372","msgId":44995,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk5djljNCticTZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYwNjcyNS44OTM0Ny5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44993,"nextInTopic":44997,"prevInTime":44994,"nextInTime":44996,"topicId":44991,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the things we are going to do for him is get him a lock for his door.
