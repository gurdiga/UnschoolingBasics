They sent playground pictures back and forth, discussed the weather...all in a couple of sentences at a time.  Of course, I thought it was great....my son asked everyday if &quot;toby&quot; had written back yet..then, nothing. So, if anyone has a son who is looking for an email penpal , please email us privately at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janqlan@...\">janqlan@...</a>.
