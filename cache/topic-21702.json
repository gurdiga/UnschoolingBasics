DST will start three weeks earlier on March 11, 2007, and end one week later on November 4, 2007. This results in a new DST period that is four weeks longer than previously observed. Unless certain updates are applied to your computer, it is possible that the time zone settings for your computer&#39;s system clock may be incorrect during this four week period. In particular, you must make sure that both your Windows operating system and your calendar programs are updated. <br/>\n  Do I have to update my computer?
