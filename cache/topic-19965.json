(Of course, you may believe she was a<br/>\n&gt; TERRIBLE mother, <br/>\n&gt; in which case I wouldn&#39;t ever say such if you want a<br/>\n&gt; good <br/>\n&gt; relationship with her.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree, however, that it is unrealistic to expect<br/>\n&gt; her to actually <br/>\n&gt; practise your parenting style.  She can respect it<br/>\n&gt; without agreeing <br/>\n&gt; with it or liking it and that&#39;s the only thing<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s realistic to <br/>\n&gt; expect.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As for your children, I know there are often fears<br/>\n&gt; from outside <br/>\n&gt; unschooling about how children will learn to adjust<br/>\n&gt; to a more <br/>\n&gt; structured world, in work and other environments. <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps you could <br/>\n&gt; all look at these visits as a grand experiment in<br/>\n&gt; living &quot;on the <br/>\n&gt; other side&quot; so they can decide for themselves if<br/>\n&gt; some of these rules <br/>\n&gt; are really so bad (without your editorial) or if<br/>\n&gt; they open them up <br/>\n&gt; for other opportunities...  After all, if your<br/>\n&gt; daughter did one day <br/>\n&gt; decide to be a lawyer, she&#39;d be bound by lots and<br/>\n&gt; lots of rules.  <br/>\n&gt; Maybe she&#39;ll decide she never wants to be bound by<br/>\n&gt; such a strict <br/>\n&gt; environment or maybe she&#39;ll feel she can make the<br/>\n&gt; trade to attain <br/>\n&gt; other goals... in any case, I really think this is a<br/>\n&gt; great chance to <br/>\n&gt; see how &quot;the other half lives&quot; and decide on their<br/>\n&gt; own what it means <br/>\n&gt; to them.  Besides, we all have to follow SOME rules<br/>\n&gt; SOMETIMES - like <br/>\n&gt; when we drive a car, for instance, and maybe you can<br/>\n&gt; explain it that <br/>\n&gt; way?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Surely, your children are in part reacting to your<br/>\n&gt; own negativity <br/>\n&gt; and frustration with the situation.  Maybe if you<br/>\n&gt; all agreed ahead <br/>\n&gt; of time that for a few days life was going to be<br/>\n&gt; different they <br/>\n&gt; would find they spend more quality time with their<br/>\n&gt; grandmother and <br/>\n&gt; achieve a better relationship with her (and that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; the trade-off for <br/>\n&gt; rules) or maybe they&#39;ll continue to hate the<br/>\n&gt; rules... who knows?  If <br/>\n&gt; you tell them it&#39;s bad though, they&#39;ll likely agree<br/>\n&gt; without <br/>\n&gt; question.  If you hand your mother your children to<br/>\n&gt; look after, <br/>\n&gt; expect her to respect your views, but don&#39;t respect<br/>\n&gt; HERS, what will <br/>\n&gt; your children take away from that?  How do you think<br/>\n&gt; that makes your <br/>\n&gt; mother feel?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sure it&#39;s very frustrating and disheartening and<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t envy <br/>\n&gt; your situation.
