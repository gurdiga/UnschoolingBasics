It is a gorgeous<br/>\nterracotta on a sage t shirt. It says Enjoy Life Unschooling and had a<br/>\ncatchy graphic of a child at play. The sleeve has the conference<br/>\ninformation. They will be amazing. I can&#39;t wait to get one :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/registration/\">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/registration/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nALSO registration is still going. Our spaces are limited and we are closing<br/>\nin on capacity!!! There are 8 days left for the GENERAL registration after<br/>\nthat we stop taking T shirt orders and the conference fees go up. Reserve<br/>\nyour space while we still have some available. And save some money. You can<br/>\norder a shirt on its own if you can&#39;t come :-( They are worth wearing around<br/>\ntown flying your freak flag!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to meet everyone who is coming. I will be sure to come say HI!<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40919,"nextTopicId":40936}}
