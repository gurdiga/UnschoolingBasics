I really think that no matter how much freedom we give","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1737034239\">Millie,<br/>\nAs Joan said.... &quot;My son for instance, still thinks of my body as<br/>\none with his in many ways.&quot;  I really think that no matter how much freedom we give our kids, they are still little people in a big world, and there are so many things they can&#39;t control...they are learning about what those things are (including you!). IME, being &quot;bossy&quot; at this stage is not something they learn (although it is easy to assume that, since so many kids are bossed), I think it&#39;s a combination of temperment and developmental stage/cognitive processing. It&#39;s tough though, because I know that I felt that I was doing something wrong or treating DD badly because of the way she would talk to me and other adults (rarely other kids, FYI).<br/>\nI also try not to use the term bossy when I&#39;m talking to her or other adults (or when I&#39;m thinking about it), but rather &quot;Wow, she really knows what she wants!&quot; <br/>\nJoan&#39;s comments about humor are great. I&#39;d also add, what works for us...humor combined with logical consequences and a clear/non guilt tripping expression of needs. &quot;I would *love* to play Wizard of Oz with you now, honey, but my body is *so* hungry that I wouldn&#39;t be able to concentrate on the game or really enjoy spending time with you. I&#39;d be sitting there thinking &#39;food food food food (in a silly voice), instead of remembering the words to your songs that you like so much. It&#39;s important to me to give you my full attention so we can both have fun.&quot; Here I stop talking, and Bethan (3.25) usually says something like &quot;I have a *great* idea, why don&#39;t *you* eat something, and *then* come play Wizarder of Ozzer with me!!&quot; If she doesn&#39;t come up with that solution herself, or continues to press, I either offer that as a solution &quot;Are you willing to...&quot; or I encourage her to come up with other ideas &quot;Can you figure out a way that I can eat and we can play the game at the same time.&quot; It&#39;s lovely to see what wonderful ideas she comes up that are &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; and get both of our needs met. <br/>\nIn the past, I&#39;ve said things to her like &quot;You wish mommy would do exactly what you want me to, exactly the *way* you want me to, just like Joanie (her doll) does. But I&#39;m not like Joanie, because I have feelings and sometimes I need to do things differently from the way you want me to. I sometimes wish everybody would do exactly what *I* wanted them to, but then just think how boring the world would be! (and then I do some silly skit where everbody does what I want, and wackiness ensues). <br/>\nThis is a tough issue, one that DH is working on. He does things like &quot;Bethan, is it okay if I go to the bathroom?&quot; And she says...&#39;No! Play with me!&quot;...He&#39;ll then look at me as if to say &quot;Okay, what do I do now? I gotta pee!&quot; LOL. It&#39;s a journey. <br/>\nJen <br/>\n--<br/>\n&quot;Out there things can happen and <br/>\nfrequently do <br/>\nto people as brainy and footsy as <br/>\nyou.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi, Millie, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think there are a couple of things going on at this stage - which both of <br/>\n&gt; my chileren went through - my son is still figuring it out. With the things <br/>\n&gt; that take your attention away from him, I think he&#39;s just wanting your <br/>\n&gt; attention all the time and doesn&#39;t have the skills to make polite requests <br/>\n&gt; yet. So you&#39;d probably like him to say &quot;Mama, could you put your sewing <br/>\n&gt; down, please? I&#39;d really like to play with you.&quot; And he will learn that <br/>\n&gt; from your example when you want him to stop doing something and pay <br/>\n&gt; attention to you, and from your possibly asking him to say it differently if <br/>\n&gt; you wish. But our experience is that takes a while - I&#39;m still reminding my <br/>\n&gt; 3 1/2 yr old to do this, but he&#39;s a lot better than he used to be. A key to <br/>\n&gt; my own stress is to reframe what he&#39;s said in my mind. So when my son (who <br/>\n&gt; still does this) says &quot;Mama, don&#39;t take a shower!&quot; I hear it as &quot;Mama, I so <br/>\n&gt; love to play with you and be with you that the idea of being apart from you <br/>\n&gt; in the shower makes me really sad&quot;...and sometimes I reflect this back to <br/>\n&gt; him to remind us that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about with &quot;Nicky, do you not want to <br/>\n&gt; be apart from mama. Is that hard?&quot; Sometimes I just put off the shower, <br/>\n&gt; try to do it when he is distracted by a video or playing well with his <br/>\n&gt; sister for company. Sometimes I ask him when would be a good time for him <br/>\n&gt; to have me do it since Mama is so stinky and wants to get clean and we can <br/>\n&gt; agree on a good time for both of us. That type of thing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The thing where he tells you not to eat cereal I perceive as kids learning <br/>\n&gt; boundaries as they grow. My son for instance, still thinks of my body as <br/>\n&gt; one with his in many ways. He&#39;ll give me orders about my body. When I say <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Nicky, that&#39;s mama&#39;s body and I decide about my body. This is Nicky&#39;s body <br/>\n&gt; and Nicky decides about his body&quot; he&#39;ll often reply &quot;No, that (pointing to <br/>\n&gt; MY body) is Nicky&#39;s body!&quot; Well, when you think about it, we did in fact <br/>\n&gt; start out as one when he was in the womb. He grew as a part of me and we <br/>\n&gt; were the same body. Makes sense to me that the separating and the figuring <br/>\n&gt; out of boundaries might take some time, especially since we are extended <br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding. So he doesn&#39;t want me to eat food that HE doesn&#39;t like etc. <br/>\n&gt; I pretty much take it in stride and try to accomodate him while reminding <br/>\n&gt; him about his body and my body. If it&#39;s going to really drive him to tears <br/>\n&gt; to see me eat something he doesn&#39;t like one day, I&#39;ll just eat something <br/>\n&gt; else. Obviously if he doesnt&#39; want me to eat at all (which has happened), <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m going to explain I have to eat and try to find some way he can <br/>\n&gt; contribute to my eating that helps him feel good about it. Like helping me <br/>\n&gt; make toast or something. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is sort of a tricky thing and it&#39;s hard not to perceive it as ordering us <br/>\n&gt; around, but I think there are other messages underneath! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joan <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I need some help on this issue. Will is quite opinionated and &quot;bosses&quot; me <br/>\n&gt; around. I am not sure where this has come from, as I do not &quot;boss&quot; him in <br/>\n&gt; any way...that is, I do not tell him what to do, what not to do, etc. He is <br/>\n&gt; totally free and even more so since I have come to this list. But before <br/>\n&gt; that even, I have never restricted him at all. Yet he is saying to me &quot;No <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t sit in the chair, Mama, sit on the floor,&quot; (fine, I sit on the floor), <br/>\n&gt; &quot;No, Mama, don&#39;t sew, DON&quot;T SEW,&quot; (okay, maybe I have been wrapped up in <br/>\n&gt; this project, I&#39;ll go play w him), &quot;Don&#39;t take a shower.&quot; (well, I need to <br/>\n&gt; get clean!), &quot;Don&#39;t check you e-mail,&quot; (fine, it&#39;ll wait), and even &quot;No, <br/>\n&gt; Mama, don&#39;t eat cereal.&quot; (Baby, I&#39;m hungry...) If I say to him that I am <br/>\n&gt; hungry and I keep eating he proceeds to stand there and scream. It is not <br/>\n&gt; that he wants me to play w him or whatever, we have playing together all <br/>\n&gt; morning, but that he wants to <br/>\n&gt; tell me what to do and don&#39;t do. I don&#39;t like to hear him pissed and <br/>\n&gt; upset, screaming or crying, and normally I do all I can do help him get <br/>\n&gt; happy, but this has been going on for a while now and I AM doing what he <br/>\n&gt; tells me to do or not doing what he tells me not to do, and I know that <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t right. But I hate for him to be upset, especially if it is because of <br/>\n&gt; me, but my goodness, I need to eat and shower....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Will is quite opinionated and &quot;bosses&quot; me around.  I am not sure where this has come from, as I do not &quot;boss&quot; him in any way...that is, I do not tell him what to do, what not to do, etc.  He is totally free and even more so since I have come to this list.  But before that even, I have never restricted him at all.  Yet he is saying to me &quot;No don&#39;t sit in the chair, Mama, sit on the floor,&quot; (fine, I sit on the floor), &quot;No, Mama, don&#39;t sew, DON&quot;T SEW,&quot; (okay, maybe I have been wrapped up in this project, I&#39;ll go play w him), &quot;Don&#39;t take a shower.&quot; (well, I need to get clean!), &quot;Don&#39;t check you e-mail,&quot; (fine, it&#39;ll wait), and even &quot;No, Mama, don&#39;t eat cereal.&quot; (Baby, I&#39;m hungry...)  If I say to him that I am hungry and I keep eating he proceeds to stand there and scream.  It is not that he wants me to play w him or whatever, we have playing together all morning, but that he wants to<br/>\n tell me what to do and don&#39;t do.  I don&#39;t like to hear him pissed and upset, screaming or crying, and normally I do all I can do help him get happy, but this has been going on for a while now and I AM doing what he tells me to do or not doing what he tells me not to do, and I know that isn&#39;t right.  But I hate for him to be upset, especially if it is because of me, but my goodness, I need to eat and shower....<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said I can&#39;t figure out where he has learned this type of behavior as he has not been bossed around in his life....but I would like some help on setting some boundaries.  Would you suggest being hard in this regard, like, &quot;Mama is hungry, I am eating, I&#39;ll share mine w you or get you something if you want to eat, too, but I am eating,&quot; and then just sit there and let him scream and cry? I have never let him cry and it doesn&#39;t feel right.  Or should I continue to give in and let him tell me what to do...and hopefully it will pass?  I have always modeled kindness, consideration...and he IS exhibiting these traits in OTHER areas...  I don&#39;t like being demanded to do anything, and that is a BIG reason why I have chosen to never make demands of him...wish he would return the favor!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nMillie<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!
