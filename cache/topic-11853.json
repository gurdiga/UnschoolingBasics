I&#39;ve  <br/>\nread on the group some people witnessing this, and I&#39;ve seen it but  <br/>\nnever really *saw* the same thing...but yeah, saw the teachers saying  <br/>\nhurry up, find a fact, lets move on. We spent all this time in the  <br/>\ngorilla rooms, and none of the kids were happy to be there, while  <br/>\nEmily and Rachel were looking at a skeletal reproduction and talking  <br/>\nabout why the bone on top of the head was so big, the skull so small,  <br/>\nthe shape of the jaw. It just kind of hurt to see the kids herded  <br/>\naround like animals to see animals. And don&#39;t get me started on the  <br/>\npark there!<br/>\nThe omniplex was much the same, unhappy kids pushing and shoving to  <br/>\nsee stuff and do stuff because they knew their time was limited.<br/>\nAnd tonight at our house, our previously homeschooling friends (who  <br/>\nput their kids in Veritas academy to teach love of God through a  <br/>\nclassical education (their mission statement, not mine) ahem, sorry  <br/>\nfor the double parentheses) were over for a sedar.  One of the 9yo&#39;s  <br/>\nwas talking to Josh about the schoolwork they have to do, and Josh  <br/>\nsaid he doesn&#39;t have to do anything. Jon looked over at me  <br/>\ndisbelieving and said Really? I said yeah, and he said, you should  <br/>\nbuy shirley grammer! When I asked him why, he said because it was  <br/>\nreally hard, and that&#39;s how you know you&#39;re learning something. Gag  <br/>\nme with a freaking smurf!<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11671,"nextTopicId":11854}}
