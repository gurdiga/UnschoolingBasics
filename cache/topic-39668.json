Will it  <br/>\nbring greater joy into your lives? Will it be kind? Will it be  <br/>\nrespectful of who they are?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect when people begin on unschooling discussion sites, they  <br/>\nassume the set of unschooling parenting beliefs are held &quot;just  <br/>\nbecause&quot;. Just because they seem right to those who write most often.  <br/>\nBut why are the vocal list members more right about parenting than  <br/>\nother people? So new people offer their opinion, knowing they&#39;re  <br/>\nright, knowing they&#39;ll raise an outcry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what&#39;s offered is never new. Virtually everyone understands  <br/>\nconventional parenting practices, that is: where the parent is right  <br/>\nand the parent employs various techniques to move the child to the  <br/>\nparent&#39;s point of view.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes those methods &quot;work&quot;. By work I mean the kids are  <br/>\nrelatively kind and trustworthy away from their parents. Sometimes  <br/>\nthose methods fail miserably: the kids are rude and sneaky when out  <br/>\nof sight of their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems it&#39;s a crap shoot. It seems there&#39;s no rhyme or reason why  <br/>\nthe methods sometimes work and sometimes don&#39;t. So, you do the best  <br/>\nyou can and hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it isn&#39;t a crap shoot. There are reasons why conventional  <br/>\nparenting sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#39;t. And it has to do  <br/>\nwith whether the kids feel loved and respected for who they are. We  <br/>\n*think* we&#39;re being loving and respectful with conventional  <br/>\nparenting, but it&#39;s not until we step away from it that we can see  <br/>\nhow incredibly disrespectful it is. It causes parents to treat  <br/>\nchildren in ways that they&#39;d never treat a fellow adult. It requires  <br/>\nus to assume kids are some creature other than human, who will react  <br/>\nreasonably when treated in ways that would outrage adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes conventional parenting seem to work for some families is  <br/>\n1) the mix of personalities and 2) what *else* the parents do that  <br/>\n(inadvertently) counteracts the disrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo parenting method can change personalities. Nothing will turn a  <br/>\nstrong willed child into a compliant child so a parent can make  <br/>\nconventional parenting work. It&#39;s a recipe for disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;what else&quot; the parents do is the key. It isn&#39;t the conventional  <br/>\nparenting that&#39;s working. It&#39;s the &quot;what else.&quot; Unfortunately most  <br/>\nparents take the &quot;what else&quot; for granted and assume it&#39;s the  <br/>\nconventional methods that got the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat &quot;what else&quot; is what we discuss here. We discuss how to use the  <br/>\nprinciples of respect, kindness, joyful living to help our kids get  <br/>\nwhat they want in ways that are kind and respectful and safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Children in our two countries have so much more than most in the  <br/>\n&gt; world.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While this is true, it won&#39;t help us treat our kids with kindness and  <br/>\nrespect if we&#39;re viewing their natural wonder with the world (which  <br/>\nincludes manufactured products) as a problem. Our solutions will  <br/>\nfocus on how we can get the kids to change to be decent human beings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore respectful is to live our values rather than imposing them. If  <br/>\nwe think we should live with less, we should live with less *for  <br/>\nourselves*. When kids want something, rather than working on their  <br/>\nthinking as wrong and trying to change it, we can draw on our  <br/>\ntechniques to find options *in addition to* buying something retail:  <br/>\nswaps, yard sales, thrift stores, trading and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There was a nine month time would we only had a motorcycle for  <br/>\n&gt; transportation, but we made it work.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Attitude is huge! Attitude can make the same situation for one family  <br/>\nbe a challenging adventure and for another family be a crushing  <br/>\nburden imposed on by forces they have no control over.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we begin from a mental position that the kids are wrong, and  <br/>\nwe must get them to see the right way, it&#39;s going to be harder to be  <br/>\nloving and joyful and respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we can do instead is understand and respect kids points of view.  <br/>\nWe don&#39;t need to agree, but understanding is huge. We can see through  <br/>\ntheir eyes why they might want a car instead of a motorcycle to go  <br/>\nsomewhere when it&#39;s raining. We can see and understand and empathize  <br/>\nwith why they sometimes feel they&#39;ve lost something when a new baby  <br/>\ndisplaces them.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The first chapter of How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So  <br/>\nKids Will Talk is pretty good at helping parents see where they might  <br/>\nthink they&#39;re responding reasonably but are actually telling their  <br/>\nkids they&#39;re wrong for feeling how they feel.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, the youngest daughter had a spell when she could not  <br/>\n&gt; handle them appropriately, so I put them up for a month.  They  <br/>\n&gt; still had theirs to play with.  She really respected the toys and  <br/>\n&gt; me more after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I doubt she respected you more. She may have been more aware of how  <br/>\nshe treated the older toys because she lost the use of them for a  <br/>\nmonth. That would look like respect for your wishes (and respect for  <br/>\nyou) but it&#39;s not the same. And clarity of thought is important in  <br/>\nfinding respectful ways to help kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere would be several respectful ways of approaching this. One would  <br/>\nbe to let go and give them the toys to play with as they wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother would be allow them to borrow them with certain conditions.  <br/>\nThis is part of real life. If we use something that belongs to  <br/>\nsomeone else, we don&#39;t get to treat it as our own. If we rent a car,  <br/>\nwe can&#39;t spray paint it and expect the rental agency to be okay with  <br/>\nthat. ;-) And if we loan kids something, we can take it back for a  <br/>\nbit without it being punishment. If it&#39;s approached with the attitude  <br/>\nthat &quot;This is something important to me and it&#39;s making me nervous.  <br/>\nWhat can we do about it?&quot; And ultimately you can say &quot;Look, this  <br/>\nisn&#39;t working out and it&#39;s making me uncomfortable. Let&#39;s put it away  <br/>\nfor now and do something else like go get ice cream.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids feel respected, if they know mom puts energy into meeting  <br/>\ntheir needs, this will be heard much differently than it will to kids  <br/>\nwho hear no a lot. When kids have to fight to get their needs met,  <br/>\nthey are less respectful of others and others&#39; things because they  <br/>\nfeel disrespected. When they feel respected, they more easily grasp  <br/>\nbeing asked to respect another&#39;s boundaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Something that I have used as a guide as we have raised our  <br/>\n&gt; children is: Is this a behavior that I want to continue for two, or  <br/>\n&gt; five years?  That question has allowed us to not fret the small  <br/>\n&gt; stuff, yet not allow the bigger things to be overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And that idea could lead parents to try to correct behavior that kids  <br/>\nwill naturally grow out of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean ignoring behavior. It means treating kids as though  <br/>\nthey need help, not as though they need corrected and changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter is to help them find *better* ways to meet their needs rather  <br/>\nthan trying to correct them. Assume they&#39;re doing the best they can  <br/>\nwith the information, development and skills they currently have.  <br/>\nTreat them as though their intent is to be good and they just can&#39;t  <br/>\nfigure out a better way. They may intellectually know not to hit, for  <br/>\ninstance, may intellectually know they should use words, but they may  <br/>\nnot be able to put it into practice. They need some help, not  <br/>\ncorrection.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":323764344,"authorName":"seccotine_ch","from":"&quot;seccotine_ch&quot; &lt;seccotine@...&gt;","profile":"seccotine_ch","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Passing on values - was Being careful with things","postDate":"1240559152","msgId":39791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdzcnFuZytobHE3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5RjBBMzBDLjIwMjA1MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39790,"nextInTopic":39792,"prevInTime":39790,"nextInTime":39792,"topicId":39668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

That&#39;s a normal part of development. If a child has a favored toy - or pet, maybe - that&#39;s being harmed during a time like this, its certainly kind to take steps to see that whatever it is survives this stage intact. Those steps may include putting the toy away (or keeping the child away from the pet for a time). Parents being more present and aware can often work just as well, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking things away from people (of any age) doesn&#39;t necessarily teach respect for those things in the sense of valuing those things on an intrinsic level. It does create an economy of scarcity - which increases the value of those things in another sense. They are worth more, are more valuable, more desirable. <br/>\n<br/>\nTaking things away from people doesn&#39;t necessarily gain their respect for the person doing the taking, either. It just as easily creates resentment - which may be concealed, out of fear of further reprisals. Taking kids&#39; stuff away is a standard parenting ploy for controlling kids&#39; behavior. From an unschooling perspective, its better to look for the reasons behind that behavior - what needs are being met? Are there other ways to meet those needs? Its often possible to help kids&#39; find alternative ways to meet needs that are kinder to everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I tell you all this to say that we have chosen for our children to be respectful of things that we have.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts possible for some parents to control kids&#39; behavior to a greater or lesser extent, but its not possible to choose another person&#39;s values. Kids may or may not internalize parents&#39; values, regardless of how they behave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Something that I have used as a guide as we have raised our children is: Is this a behavior that I want to continue for two, or five years?  That question has allowed us to not fret the small stuff, yet not allow the bigger things to be overlooked.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are all sorts of behaviors kids grow out of in a year, much less five. It can be really helpful, with younger children especially, to learn as much as you can about typical behaviors of different ages - it can save a Lot of worry if your 2yo is running into walls, for instance, to know that its normal 2yo behavior ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, some kids have bigger needs than others. Ray had really Big needs when he was younger - for attention, mainly, but also for big muscle movements. At one point George and I finally asked ourselves &quot;assuming these needs are a part of Who He Is, do we really want to be arguing about these issues for the rest of his childhood?&quot; That ended up being a big step in our lives, closer to radical unschooling (although we didn&#39;t know it at the time). Having decided that daily battles Weren&#39;t worth it, we started looking for other options, other solutions - and found many ways to meet his needs that didn&#39;t involve daily arguements and a sea of &quot;nos&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;they all have been very good with recognizing that the things we have are a privilege, not a right.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************************<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was first trying to wrap my mind around unschooling, I found it helped a lot to step away from ideas like rights and priviledges where my relationship with my kids was concerned. Thinking about rights and privileges led me to be self-righteous about saying &quot;no&quot; and doing unkind things &quot;for their own good&quot;. It helped more to think about ways I could be kinder, more thoughtful, more creative. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Mo was little we used to go to the dollar store and fill a cart with everything she wanted - heap the cart high - with the understanding that we couldn&#39;t afford all those things right now. Most of the things in the cart Morgan was happy &quot;owning&quot; for the length of time it took to walk through the store. We&#39;d get two or three things and put the rest back. That&#39;s not something that will work with everyone, for sure, but it was a solution that allowed both of us to feel a sense of abundance in our life.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Passing on values - was Being careful with things","postDate":"1240507148","msgId":39770,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5RjBBMzBDLjIwMjA1MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ5RjA5Q0YzLjYwODA4QG1hYy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGdzcDhnMys3Zmt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MzZDOTQ4QzEtNEU5MS00NkNFLUFBQkUtRkZGRDFGMjY0NkNCQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8NDlGMDlDRjMuNjA4MDhAbWFjLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39768,"nextInTopic":39778,"prevInTime":39769,"nextInTime":39771,"topicId":39668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry - I m frustrated with my new laptop - there is something I m doing that hits send when I don t mean to, and I can t figure out what it is.

The writer uses the term &quot;Severe Reality <br/>\nAdjustment (SRA)&quot; and talks about how her kids think she is &quot;out to <br/>\nlunch&quot; and are balking at doing what they are supposed to do, etc. <br/>\nLengthy complaints. The only response, so far, as been someone <br/>\ndescribing how they handled the same thing in their teenager by refusing <br/>\nto take her anywhere or do anything with her for a year, until she got <br/>\n&quot;self-motivated&quot; to do the things they wanted her to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sarcasm and mean-spiritedness in both of these posts hurts my heart. <br/>\nI&#39;m hearing a lot, lately, from teen&#39;s parents about how they need rules <br/>\nand boundaries and parents shouldn&#39;t be afraid to enforce them and all <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, sometimes it seems to work. I know a family who was <br/>\nstrict, had lots of rules, the parents were very firm, there were clear <br/>\nconsequences and shame for breaking rules and, now, the grown kids have <br/>\ngood relationships with their parents and siblings and are raising their <br/>\nown kids the same way. They still go to the same church and have very <br/>\nclearly totally adopted their parents&#39; values even though the parents <br/>\nshoved them down their throats. I will say, they had lots of loving and <br/>\nhappy times in that family, too, as long as the kids toed the line.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I want to be scrupulously accurate and say it IS possible <br/>\nthat parents can try to make kids respect their values and the kids <br/>\nmight draw away and act rebellious and then, later, return to those <br/>\nvalues, especially when they have their own kids. After all, that is <br/>\nwhat they know - that is what they have to fall back on when they become <br/>\nparents.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not a good argument for doing it - for shoving our beliefs down <br/>\ntheir throats. Isn&#39;t it better to live the best we can according to our <br/>\nown beliefs? Should that not be enough of an attraction that our kids <br/>\nwill give significant consideration to what the observe in us, while <br/>\ntraveling their own path and coming to their own conclusions?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have grown up to hold pretty nearly the same values as I do <br/>\n(now) even though I&#39;ve never tried to &quot;teach&quot; those values in any way, <br/>\nshape, or form. I say &quot;now&quot; because my own values have changed, over the <br/>\nyears, too. It isn&#39;t like we&#39;re already fully formed and no longer <br/>\nlearning and developing ourselves, when we have kids.

It is amazing if you stop to think about it.  We are the parents of seven.  We were in a two bedroom college apartment when our fourth child was born.  We made the decision while we were dating to have me stay at home the entire time that we would be raising children.  My husband never did choose to finish his degree, but at no time did we really do without.  There was a nine month time would we only had a motorcycle for transportation, but we made it work.  Never have we gone into debt for anything other than a house that we bought way below market.  I tell you all this to say that we have chosen for our children to be respectful of things that we have.  The older four had a better grasp of this, but they all have been very good with recognizing that the things we have are a privilege, not a right.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToo often we give our children more than they are able to appreciate.  For example, our five girls all enjoyed playing with Barbies.  When I felt that they could be trusted to take good care of them, I allowed them to play with the dolls and camper that I had as a child.  They loved playing with them.  However, the youngest daughter had a spell when she could not handle them appropriately, so I put them up for a month.  They still had theirs to play with.  She really respected the toys and me more after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that I have used as a guide as we have raised our children is: Is this a behavior that I want to continue for two, or five years?  That question has allowed us to not fret the small stuff, yet not allow the bigger things to be overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoying the journey,<br/>\nLori in Michigan, <br/>\nWife of one,<br/>\nmother of seven ages 13,15,17,19,21,24,25<br/>\ngrandmother of two</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Being careful with things","postDate":"1240481363","msgId":39744,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2Qzk0OEMxLTRFOTEtNDZDRS1BQUJFLUZGRkQxRjI2NDZDQkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzcDhnMys3Zmt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzcDhnMys3Zmt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39743,"nextInTopic":39764,"prevInTime":39743,"nextInTime":39745,"topicId":39668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Thank you for reminding me that there is a difference between understanding something and being able to act accordingly. Sincerely.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really not a big materialistic person. Actually, it&#39;s not really about things themselves (after all, they&#39;re only here for us to use them and not the other way around), it&#39;s more about respecting the people who have made them, the stuff who&#39;s been used to make them, the work my husband and I had to do to buy them, and also the fact that we are lucky to have all this in our lives and houses, the luxury we live in. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably too abstract for them to grasp. I guess that, on the other hand, this is also about me. Not wasting is an important value for me, probably not as important as respecting kids and giving them time and space to grow, and trusting them, but an important one nonetheless. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have much money when I was a kid, and we still could go on vacation, learn music, etc. because my mother really counted every cent. I don&#39;t know how to put that in words, but what could have been a worry (Oh my God, we don&#39;t have enough money) turned into a skill (OMG, all the things we can do with little money) and I like that. It has made me a part of who I am, the fact that I consider myself rich, that I don&#39;t envy richer people, that I don&#39;t care having a big house or a big car, etc. (as I try to explain that to you, I realize that I should go further on that road and be even less attached to material belongings).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for me, it is important that books remain in good shape for as long as possible (a lifetime ?), for instance, or that music instruments aren&#39;t treated like toys ...

If &quot;you&quot; were <br/>\ncareless, it would be disrespectful because you&#39;re aware of what it <br/>\ntakes to earn the money to buy things. For you, the connection between <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s hard work and that object is crystal clear. You can&#39;t <br/>\nhelp but be aware of it. That makes it very difficult for you to be <br/>\nrealistic about the children&#39;s actual sense of those same objects. They <br/>\ndo NOT have any sense of connection between work/sacrifice and   the <br/>\ndvd&#39;s or toys or clothing or furniture. They just do not have it. <br/>\nBecause they don&#39;t have it, they aren&#39;t being disrespectful by being <br/>\ncareless. They are just being careless in the literal sense of the word <br/>\n- care-less. They care less than you because they are children.  You <br/>\ncan&#39;t make them care more right now - that will come with their own <br/>\nexperience and growth of empathy and as the become less egocentric. They <br/>\nWILL eventually care about their things - and you can focus on treating <br/>\ntheir things respectfully now, but don&#39;t project adult feelings about <br/>\nmaterial goods onto children.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake it as easy as you can for things to be well taken care of - if <br/>\nthere are particular things that bother you, figure out a system to <br/>\nhandle those particular things. If it is dvd&#39;s being left on the floor <br/>\nor in other risky places, get a pretty basket, line it with some soft <br/>\nfabric, and make that the dvd box. The kids don&#39;t need to put the discs <br/>\naway where they belong, but you can ask them to drop them into the dvd <br/>\nbasket. Or, every so often, throughout the day, you can wander through <br/>\nand gather any dvd&#39;s on the floor or the tabletops or wherever, and drop <br/>\nthem into the dvd basket. At the end of the day, put them where they <br/>\nbelong, yourself. It is WAY too much trouble to put discs away - but <br/>\ndropping them into a basket is more likely to work for them. We have a <br/>\nbasket in front of our tv that holds all the dvd&#39;s and Wii games - when <br/>\nit starts to get full, somebody goes through it and sorts everything out <br/>\nand puts all the discs into their cases.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor clothing - first, I don&#39;t think it particularly hurts clothing for <br/>\nit to be left around on the floor or bed or chairs - not unless people <br/>\nare walking on it with really dirty shoes. So, maybe just ignore it. <br/>\nBut, the big basket idea works here, too. It takes about 10 seconds to <br/>\nwander into a kids&#39; room and gather any clothing left on the floor and <br/>\ntoss it into a big open basket that is sitting right out in the open. <br/>\nProblem solved. Second - if you put hooks up - hooks that really HOLD <br/>\nthe clothing, not pegs that clothing slides off of easily - then <br/>\nstill-clean clothing can be hung there very quickly. That&#39;s a lot more <br/>\nreasonable to expect than hanging on a hanger in a closet or folding in <br/>\na drawer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother suggestion is to change the way you think about this stuff. <br/>\nDon&#39;t think of it in such broad terms as &quot;My children are careless with <br/>\nthings.&quot; That&#39;s too overwhelming plus it has a sense of negativity <br/>\ntoward the kids that isn&#39;t useful in being solution-oriented.  Instead, <br/>\nthink of it as a number of related, but different, little situations to <br/>\nresolve. Example: Given our nature/habits, how can we set up a way to <br/>\nkeep dvd&#39;s from being ruined?  THAT is a problem looking for a real <br/>\nsolution. &quot;How can I get my kids to be respectful and not careless with <br/>\ntheir things?&quot; is too general and contains within it a negativity about <br/>\nthe kids that will obstruct the solution-oriented kind of thinking that <br/>\nwill really lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable life together.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreak down problems into manageable sizes and be solution oriented.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Being careful with things","postDate":"1240426073","msgId":39716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwNDIyMTE0N3E2MmM4ZjhlYXliNTI2YzA5ODZlNGVmMTQ3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzanRtcCtybnJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzanRtcCtybnJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39701,"nextInTopic":39718,"prevInTime":39715,"nextInTime":39717,"topicId":39668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There has been loads of great ideas.

This means that we have to buy some DVD again,<br/>\nbecause they can&#39;t be read anymore, that some of our books are used in no<br/>\ntime, that they let their clothes on the floor, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n***It sounds like you are owning the problem but stuck a bit.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is the following : I really hate to see things treated that way.<br/>\nBecause we don&#39;t have the money to afford it, because I think that it is<br/>\ndisrespectful for the people who built these things, and for those who<br/>\nbought them and gave them to my kids, because it&#39;s waste and I think it&#39;s a<br/>\nshame to throw things away just because we haven&#39;t been careful ... So, when<br/>\nI see a DVD with big scratches, all this come in my mind and it is very<br/>\ndifficult for me to stay calm and explain to my kids why I think that being<br/>\ncareful is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** Remember that they are just things and that your children are living<br/>\npeople that can really be hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talk to my children informational about expenses and waste. I talk about<br/>\nreal life consequences. I try not to nag or preach or teach.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that when things have a &quot;home&quot; they are better cared for, it is<br/>\neasier. You don&#39;t have to make a desiscion about where something goes. We<br/>\nhave bins and shelves and baskets. We have a place for everything (or try<br/>\nto)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur dvds and video games have a shelf that they go on. it is out of reach<br/>\nfor the baby but not too high for a kid that knows how to work the systems.<br/>\nThey are in a closed cabinet and they are not toys. They are tools for<br/>\nviewing things.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I can&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t understand that. I don&#39;t see how<br/>\nI could make visible to them the importance of being careful. I don&#39;t want<br/>\nto get mad at them, because it is so useless (and because, in the end,<br/>\npeople&#39;s feeling are more important than things, aren&#39;t they ?). On the<br/>\nother hand, it IS important for me - so how can I do that ?<br/>\n<br/>\n***They will get it. They may have to break a few important things to<br/>\nunderstand. I have a kid who has to learn from her own experience. She needs<br/>\nto break eggs, so to speak.<br/>\n-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to explain. I know I tell you that<br/>\neverytime that I post here, but my English is a bit rudimentary (at least<br/>\nwhen I have to write, reading is fine), and it&#39;s always frustrating when you<br/>\ntry to explain your situation ...<br/>\n<br/>\n***you did fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":248268539,"authorName":"Elissa","from":"Elissa &lt;MystikMomma@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Being careful with things","postDate":"1240406993","msgId":39720,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NjU0MTgzMzEuMzk3Njc4MTI0MDQwNjk5MzY3MC5KYXZhTWFpbC5yb290QGNsMDItaG9zdDAxLnJvY2gubnkuZnJvbnRpZXJuZXQubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzbGhvZCtpMTlyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39718,"nextInTopic":39725,"prevInTime":39719,"nextInTime":39721,"topicId":39668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A few summers ago, we cut back alot of scraggly bushes on our property using a machete.

Mo tries to take care of some of her things. This weekend she came and helped me clean the living room which was (as usual) covered in paper scraps from her daily cut-and-tape fun. She was very careful about weeding out the things she wanted to keep so I didn&#39;t have to pick through the mess and try to figure that out, myself. She&#39;s only just started being able to help like this, and only if I&#39;m doing it Happily. That&#39;s important. I don&#39;t always clean happily - I sometimes do it with a dull sense of &quot;here we go again&quot; and Mo can tell the difference, for sure.

Not that DVD&#39;s don&#39;t get scratched and things broken.<br/>\nA few things that have worked for me:<br/>\n 1.Make you house child friendly. For example:<br/>\nMy couch was $25 dollars at a thrift store- they can jump whenever they want. My little antique table is in the attic because it ts too fragile for them yet.<br/>\nThey listen more when I ask them to be gentle because I don&#39;t have to often say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.I help them ALL the time care for their toys. I show them how to put in a safe place ( not on floor to be stepped on) and I do it myself most of the time but they  now do it a lot ( they are 6 and 3 yo)I don&#39;t get upset if the item is on the floor again or I have to ask to be put in a &quot;safe place&quot; for the millionth time. I either just tell them to put it or I do it my self and tell them I did. I don&#39;t nag  them. <br/>\n&quot;hey Buzz I put you DS in the safe place right there so it would not get stepped on or break&quot;<br/>\nI also tell them what I am afraid could happen when they do X or not do Y. Matter of fact. Not on an upset, condescending, teachery voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I help them fix the toys and I have replaced toys that where broken. IT happens and my kids do feel bad about it because they like their stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. I have see through containers where their toys are organized and I keep it they best I can ( I am not organized and very, very far from Bree)<br/>\n<br/>\n5. I have walls that I have painted with my kids art. A lot of them in my house are full of drawings. It works for us. I will have pretty walls when they get older. Some rooms have pretty walls but others are like a canvas.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. I tell them glass breaks , if you do this it will be like that and you cannot change. I give them information without being a nagging mom. IF it breaks I help them fix without blame ( I have failed a couple times on this but I apologized).<br/>\n<br/>\n7. For DVD&#39;s and CD ( and I have to do this more) you can just make a copy for them to handle and you keep the hard copy. Fab5DVD is a software you can download and get a free trial online that does all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. I have noticed some kids have more of a &quot;heavy hand&quot; than others.

I don&#39;t like when things become old too fast because they&#39;re not taken good care of. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is the following : I really hate to see things treated that way. Because we don&#39;t have the money to afford it, because I think that it is disrespectful for the people who built these things, and for those who bought them and gave them to my kids, because it&#39;s waste and I think it&#39;s a shame to throw things away just because we haven&#39;t been careful ... So, when I see a DVD with big scratches, all this come in my mind and it is very difficult for me to stay calm and explain to my kids why I think that being careful is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I can&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t understand that. I don&#39;t see how I could make visible to them the importance of being careful. I don&#39;t want to get mad at them, because it is so useless (and because, in the end, people&#39;s feeling are more important than things, aren&#39;t they ?).

So, when I see a DVD with big scratches, all this come in my mind and it is very difficult for me to stay calm and explain to my kids why I think that being careful is important.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I can&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t understand that. I don&#39;t see how I could make visible to them the importance of being careful. I don&#39;t want to get mad at them, because it is so useless (and because, in the end, people&#39;s feeling are more important than things, aren&#39;t they ?). On the other hand, it IS important for me - so how can I do that ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to explain. I know I tell you that everytime that I post here, but my English is a bit rudimentary (at least when I have to write, reading is fine), and it&#39;s always frustrating when you try to explain your situation ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really looking forward to reading your answers<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\nHelen in Geneva (Switzerland), mom of Sylvain (8), Cyrielle (6) and Circé (3)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39801,"nextTopicId":39826}}
