I am still frustrated and feel like I am<br/>\nfailing in some ways but I feel some support. We actually looked into<br/>\nthe SCA because it appeals to everyone in the family in different<br/>\nways. My dd has been &quot;hanging out&quot; predominately with boys as they are<br/>\n&quot;easier&quot; to understand and relate to~~say dd. She has recently started<br/>\nbasketball and football (in the neighborhood) since we moved. She has<br/>\nalso asked about starting a book descussion group as the one at the<br/>\nlibrary isn&#39;t a good match, they put kids in age groups and not by<br/>\nbooks they like. She was stuck reading &quot;the cricket in times square&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;stuart little&quot; books I read to her when she was really small. I<br/>\nam not sure how to go about it but I am thinking towards it. A friend<br/>\nsuggested a kids theater in town that I hadn&#39;t heard of, we had a bad<br/>\nexperience with the other one so we plan to try this out at the next<br/>\naudition.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that the neighborhood stuff works out because I have totally<br/>\nquit that co-op. And it is really firm decision as I just got a new<br/>\npost with all the new rules and now the classes are compulsory and<br/>\nthere is 4 different age segregate groups! (including pre-school) My<br/>\ndd is quite distraught over this as these kids have been her friends<br/>\nfor the past two years. She wants me to make play-dates with these<br/>\nkids for her but their parents don&#39;t like me/the way I parent and<br/>\nwon&#39;t. I can&#39;t really figure out a way to break that to her. I also<br/>\nsuspect that some of the parents don&#39;t like her, but I would never<br/>\nsuggest that to her. She is a strong personality. But I know several<br/>\nadults that are very similar to her and they are amazing people. I<br/>\ndon&#39;t want her to change just because she wants friends Now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been feeling really bad lately that I don&#39;t fit in. Not for<br/>\nmyself because I don&#39;t even like these people but my kids are<br/>\nsuffering. I am trying to figure some stuff out for myself. I started<br/>\nreading this Byron Katie book which is what helped me to realize that<br/>\nI don&#39;t even like these people.

If she can babysit or be a mother&#39;s helper to some<br/>\n&gt;  imaginative kids who are just a little younger than she is - that can<br/>\n&gt;  work well. Even my now-17 yo still likes to play with younger kids<br/>\n&gt;  quite often.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  Also, maybe introduce her to role-playing games such as dungeons and<br/>\n&gt;  dragons - that&#39;s a good way to transition into a more mature form of<br/>\n&gt;  imaginative play. This is also a good time for her to read lots of<br/>\n&gt;  science fiction and/or fantasy books - maybe start a book discussion<br/>\n&gt;  group. Maybe join a re-enactment group such as the SCA or a civil war<br/>\n&gt;  living history group.

Some are &quot;growing up&quot; fast - flirting with boys, dressing <br/>\nto show off their bodies, gossiping, etc. My daughter is not there <br/>\neither, and sometimes feels left out by girls she used to play with. <br/>\nThis is really painful for me to observe- though I think a lot of it is <br/>\nbecause it reminds me so much of myself at that age and situations in <br/>\nwhich I felt very uncomfortable at school. A lot of listening is needed <br/>\nand seeking out of comfortable situations. Girls are very different from <br/>\neach other physically at this age- I think that has a lot to do with it. <br/>\nI am trying to see that as okay and not judge the other girls or their <br/>\nparents- some of it seems due to development and personality in addition <br/>\nto parenting style in my observation. My daughter spends a lot of time <br/>\nwith her cousins- one a year younger, one a year older. They still play <br/>\nand play- they spent the day Friday outside playing on the trampoline <br/>\nand going on safari with an umbrella and picnic basket- they sew and <br/>\ndraw a lot- they have been making very cute bears and slippers. I think <br/>\nthe older cousin probably acts quite differently around other friends. <br/>\nWe do have a nice group of kids still who aren&#39;t as &quot;mature&quot;. I am <br/>\norganizing a girls group that meets weekly that does different <br/>\nactivities each week- so far this spring we have baked bread, sewed <br/>\nstuffed bears, and today we are meeting at a park- the girls also just <br/>\nplay a lot. The reason that we meet as girls only is due to that strong <br/>\npreference by my daughter and the other girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;She said that my<br/>\n &gt;kids were too worldly for her kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Someone said this in relation to choices we were making- I think it was <br/>\nallowing my kids to read comic books- Calvin and Hobbes, and Garfield. <br/>\nHer kids would come over and spend the whole time reading comics- she <br/>\nstopped calling us to get together after a while. I have also suspected <br/>\nthat other parents have chosen to curtail relationships due to this- <br/>\nespecially one waldorf homeschooling family. I actually would prefer to <br/>\nhear it directly- wondering why a family doesn&#39;t call or avoids getting <br/>\ntogether is more confusing- though it is still painful and awkward. I <br/>\nhave needed to tell other parents that my kids weren&#39;t interested in <br/>\nplaying with their kids for one reason or another, too. It is so <br/>\ndifficult to find the right way to say it and feelings seem to be hurt <br/>\neven when I am careful. The families we are around really range in their <br/>\nparenting styles and their choices. I think my kids have learned more or <br/>\nless to be generally &quot;appropriate&quot; as they are 11 and 14, but it feels <br/>\nkind of stilted and not so much fun to watch ourselves all the time so <br/>\nas not to alienate or offend. I doubt my son does this around his <br/>\nfriends but certainly does around parents. This is really all tricky- <br/>\nbut my kids need people to be with so we try and try. I feel really <br/>\nanxious at times about certain things that I am pretty sure others will <br/>\nbe judgmental about- mostly just avoiding the subject works though <br/>\nsometimes I am inspired to explain myself and sometimes regret it. It is <br/>\nlike we are hiding part of who we are quite often and it doesn&#39;t always <br/>\nfeel so good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: 11 y/os","postDate":"1208927599","msgId":32031,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU2RUJEODNBLURDRUUtNEM4OS05MUY0LTJGQTgyRDQ4QkFGOEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGZ1bTFmOSthZm8xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ1bTFmOSthZm8xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32017,"nextInTopic":32041,"prevInTime":32030,"nextInTime":32032,"topicId":31964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I liked puppetry too! I <br/>\nwas one who NEVER fit. I never talked on the phone, gossiped, etc. I <br/>\nwas NOT imaginative in that I hated role playing but once I found sci-<br/>\nfi-fantasy it did help me adjust to the world more and be less <br/>\ndepressed as a teen. I even started taking classes to volunteer at <br/>\nthe hospital. I wanted to be around infants as much as possible. Old <br/>\npeople scared me but I know some teens my age loved going to nursing <br/>\nhomes and doing projects with them, playing games, putting on plays. <br/>\nI was an extremely shy teen and so my mother stuck by my side alot <br/>\nand that helped me adjust to things I wanted to do but wasn&#39;t able to <br/>\ndo by myself. So try and think of what she can do and how to adjust, <br/>\nnot what she can&#39;t to enjoy herself :)<br/>\nI know you do, as most people on here seem to. Just a reminder :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wanted to let you know I can relate to a degree about people <br/>\nnot wanting to be friends with you and your kids. We have just signed <br/>\nmy son (almsot 4) up for soccer and our fear was that the parents <br/>\nwould make it known to their children that they should not play with <br/>\nour son. So far we have only been to one practice, so we will have to <br/>\nsee hwo things go. We have done nothing wrong but people don&#39;t like <br/>\nus for various reasons (not being silent about injustices, not being <br/>\nrich enough to live here, not thinking kids have to be in the best <br/>\nschools to succeed, etc.) My son has never been schooled outside of <br/>\nour family, besides a montesorri camp. He has not had any friends his <br/>\nage either. We have had run-ins at the park but for the most part we <br/>\ndon&#39;t fit in and our son may have suffered as a result, maybe not.  <br/>\nEven Dh&#39;s family has turned against us for various reasons through <br/>\nthe past yrs. Long story :) So I don&#39;t have any pointers for finding <br/>\nsolutions. But despite everything we have been through, I do think <br/>\nyou should stick to your guns when you feel the need. I don&#39;t regret <br/>\nany of our decisions. Maybe one day people can live together and show <br/>\nmore love and tolerance. Or we should all find a way to have a <br/>\ncommunity together, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241586873,"authorName":"barefootmamax4","from":"&quot;barefootmamax4&quot; &lt;barefootmamax4@...&gt;","profile":"barefootmamax4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: 11 y/os","postDate":"1208870628","msgId":31986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1a290NCtudmMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNDIxMTU1OHczZGJlZmRmY3k1ZTA1MGJjNjQyMWY2YmY3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31974,"nextInTopic":31989,"prevInTime":31985,"nextInTime":31987,"topicId":31964,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 11 and he is still very much into playing.He is the second oldest in our homeschooling group which ranges in age from 6- 12.There is a lot of playing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-107081051\">My son is 11 and he is still very much into playing.He is the <br/>\nsecond oldest in our homeschooling group which ranges in age from 6-<br/>\n12.There is a lot of playing games and pokemon discussion.He does <br/>\nmostly play with younger kids except for one 12 yr old who likes <br/>\ngames and playing just as much.<br/>\n  I have had people tell me how he needs to start growing up and <br/>\nacting his age.
