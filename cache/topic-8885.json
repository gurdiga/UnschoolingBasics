My son was 3 1/2 when he was potty-<br/>\ntrained. I was beginning to wonder if he&#39;d still be in diapers when <br/>\nhe went to college ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing for you to do is... relax. I promise you, your child <br/>\nwill learn to use the toilet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, have there been many changes in your family&#39;s life lately? <br/>\nOur pediatrician at the time thought our son&#39;s reluctance was due, in <br/>\npart, to stressors or changes in the household (he&#39;d be &quot;thisclose&quot; <br/>\nto being completely out of diapers, then something major would <br/>\nhappen - we&#39;d move, my husband had his foot crushed at work - you get <br/>\nthe idea - and he&#39;d be back in diapers refusing to use the toilet. <br/>\nHis doctor said it was fairly common for changes to affect a child&#39;s <br/>\ntoilet training, as that was pretty much the only area of a child&#39;s <br/>\nlife that they (the child) has *complete* control over.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can try moving the potty to whatever room they&#39;re in. I know this <br/>\nworks for many kids - mine was not one of them. He absolutely, <br/>\npositively refused to go to the bathroom in any room *but* the <br/>\nbathroom. He said if daddy didn&#39;t go potty in the living room, he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t going to, either! <br/>\n<br/>\nMy cousin suggested that I give up the pull-ups altogether and use <br/>\nregular cloth underwear with plastic covers to go over them (yes, you <br/>\ncan get them in sizes for bigger kids). My son *hated* the wet <br/>\nfeeling of the underwear and was using the toilet exclusively in <br/>\nabout 3 days. <br/>\n<br/>\nCarri Ann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8775,"nextTopicId":8863}}
