I take photos that fit the story, do the writing, and then, using the &quot;photo book&quot; feature--combine them into a book.  The templates are fairly flexible, ease of us is pretty good (I&#39;m not patient with technology), and the price is good, too.  I&#39;m sure there are a lot of other sites that do what Lulu does....this is just what I&#39;ve used.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo give another option----my 10 year old loves to write and draw.  I buy bare books (I think you can google these to find where to purchase...I purchase them at our university bookstore for about $4) and let her write and illustrate.  If she wants to make copies (for Christmas gifts, for ie) we color copy onto cardstock and have them bound.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps---<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leah44@...\">leah44@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, December 09, 2011 9:32 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Children&#39;s Computer Writing Program<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n  My almost 8 year old daughter desperately wants some kind of computer program that she can write and design her own books...something that allows her to scan in pictures, use photos, or do the art work on the computer.
