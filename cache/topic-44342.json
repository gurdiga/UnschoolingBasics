We prefer it as it&#39;s a<br/>\nmore comprehensive look at what the kids are doing<br/>\nand what their skills are.  Although we&#39;ve already had ours reviewed - I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think you are late in the game - the assessment<br/>\nforms don&#39;t need to be turned in until the beginning of your districts<br/>\nschool year.  Now I particularly enjoy the portfolio<br/>\nas it is a way for me to stave off the &quot;are we doing enough&quot; momma<br/>\nbologna that happens from time to time.  I found our<br/>\nreviewer via a local yahoo home school group.  We love working with our<br/>\nreviewer and plan to do so for as long as she is available.<br/>\nThe whole process is stress free.  I can&#39;t imagine why you would need to<br/>\nhave a different reviewer for higher grades unless<br/>\nyou felt that you needed some guidance.  In which case, I would just<br/>\nfind other families with kids of a similar age and ask<br/>\nthem what they do or how they work out various issues....  You can find<br/>\nsome info on reviewers here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homeschool/</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homescdhool/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/oh-homescdhool/</a>&gt;    in their files<br/>\nsection is an area for notification and assessment options - they<br/>\nhave a list you can work from of certified teachers.  Or speak with<br/>\nother homeschoolers/unschoolers in your area.  My best<br/>\nadvice is to find a reviewer that jives with you and your philosophy and<br/>\nask them what they like to see - since its your first<br/>\nyear with a portfolio, most folks will be flexible.  Our portfolio is a<br/>\njournal that shows what they were doing in the<br/>\nbeginning, middle, and end of the year.  We have some photos (okay a<br/>\nlot).  I also include samples of stuff they worked<br/>\non - typically something that is representative of their writing ability<br/>\nand a list of books they&#39;ve read.  I also slap<br/>\nall of this online so the extended family (and ex-spouse) can see what<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been up to and so I don&#39;t have to carry around<br/>\nbag/boxes when we go to meet the reviewer -I just send her this year&#39;s<br/>\nlink - then we meet to talk, she signs papers<br/>\n(which she provides) and I give her cash for her time ($50 for two<br/>\nkids).  Voila!  I provide more than some people and<br/>\nprobably less than others, but I like it how we do it.  I figure by the<br/>\ntime the kids reach college age (and if they pursue<br/>\ncollege) - we&#39;ll have a substantial amount of information to provide in<br/>\nlieu of (or in conjunction with) a transcript.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps,<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Portfolio requirements","postDate":"1276000978","msgId":44345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlteF9SdExVMmtIcFRrVnJUTFdrYkJfZHhtb3U4bDJUNXM5MS1pa0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1amk1MituZXN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh1amk1MituZXN1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44342,"nextInTopic":44347,"prevInTime":44344,"nextInTime":44346,"topicId":44342,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/world#us this is Sandra Dodd s list of US unschooling lists and resources.
