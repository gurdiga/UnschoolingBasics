We try to remember to bring it when we know there will be a <br/>\nbunch of people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother game that we like is Cadoo - pictionary, charades, and <br/>\ntrivia bits all rolled into one along with a bit of board game <br/>\nstrategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s also one called Chronology that is card based (it is a <br/>\nbit &#39;educational&#39; but we never let that stop us lol) - each player <br/>\nis dealt two cards. Each has a date and an event. They set their <br/>\ninitial parameters or boundaries (each person&#39;s set is different <br/>\nobviously). Then the player to my left draws a card and reads the <br/>\nevent. I have to decide if it is before my early date, after my late <br/>\ndate, or in between. If I choose correctly, I put it into my <br/>\ntimeline. And play moves on to the next person. On my next turn, I <br/>\nnow have 4 choices instead of 3 - before the early, after the late, <br/>\nbetween early and new card, between new card and late. Hmm example <br/>\nmight be in order:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am dealt: Columbus&#39; first voyage 1492 and NY Mets win the World <br/>\nSeries 1969 and the new card is Stock market crash begins the great <br/>\ndepression in the United States, that would go between my original <br/>\ncards since that was 1929. Now, on my next turn I would have to <br/>\ndecide whether the new event was pre-1492, between 1492-1929, <br/>\nbetween 1929-1969, after 1969. And, yes, there are things pre-1492 <br/>\n(Pyramids built for example is in there - typically those <br/>\nare &quot;circa&quot; items and there&#39;s a special rule for dealing with it if <br/>\nyou have two that potentially overlap). If you draw something with <br/>\nthe same date (say, NY Jets win the Super Bowl which is also 1969) <br/>\nthen as long as I pick a span with 1969 at one end or the other, it <br/>\nworks.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably not for really little kids but DS has played it (he&#39;s 7 <br/>\nnow) and with a bit of help to work things out logically when <br/>\npossible (like, did they have cars when they were building the <br/>\npyramids?) - some stuff catches adults by surprise so a logically <br/>\nthinking child might even beat an adult depending on what cards are <br/>\ndrawn. First person to assemble a 7 card timeline wins - but you <br/>\ncould change how many cards if you choose. Often the game sort of <br/>\ngoes off track because you start discussing and exploring an event <br/>\nand the game gets forgotten in the exploration and off we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: failing at unschooling","postDate":"1133205895","msgId":7988,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJBNTY4QjA5LThCQzYtNDY1MC04NEFBLUM1ODRFOUE0RTkzQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdiLjUyNDQwMzkwLjMwYmM4MjMyQGFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDdiLjUyNDQwMzkwLjMwYmM4MjMyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7986,"nextInTopic":7990,"prevInTime":7987,"nextInTime":7989,"topicId":7935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They <br/>\nseem more pure; no luck or chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family&#39;s new favorite game, however, is neither a strategy game <br/>\nnor a board game, but is called Apples to Apples and is an extremely <br/>\nfun interactive game of comparisons. There are basically no rules, <br/>\nand no real winning, because it is all so subjective that you know <br/>\nyou&#39;re just playing to have fun. It&#39;s based on debate and <br/>\npersuasion, as well as *making connections*, and definitely breeds <br/>\ngood lawyers :) We also like Set, which is at the opposite end of <br/>\nthe spectrum (silent), but still engaging.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Amelie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

Especially the part about driving them around until they fell asleep as toddlers and your friend with the stroller.  So many people think I am a bit freakish doing it that way but with high need children most of the time it is all about doing what works at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a specific work schedule range in my head.  Your description is almost exactly how I do it.  But the &quot;work&quot; schedule helps me make mental shifts that I need to make in order to give myself down time and me time.  When I did not have my work hours, I felt like what I had to do was endless.  I have also made either Sat or Sun a bona fide day to VEGETATE!  I don&#39;t care if dishes get washed or family gets fed.  My hubby is home so he can help with meals.  On which ever day I take to veg, I do ONLY what I want to do.  Nothing else.  Somedays I watch movies and surf the net.  Other days, I go on a hike or work in the yard.  But the only requirement I have is that I won&#39;t do anything that I don&#39;t want to do on my Veg day.  I am so refreshed by the end of the day that I am ready to tackle daily responsiblities again.  It is really helping as I adjust to life as an unschooling familiy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a really great thread and I am learning quite alot.

My <br/>\nstructure was to get everyone fed and have some laundry going and a  bit of cleaning <br/>\ndone here and there.  Otherwise, I HAD to be on their  schedule.  My toddlers <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t nap would usually do so in the car if I  timed it well.  I would <br/>\ndrive until they slept and then parked and read  books or magazines!   When <br/>\nthe oldest didn&#39;t nap anymore, we would  park at home and play in the yard.  <br/>\nDidn&#39;t do much for getting things done,  but gave me some peace.  One friend of <br/>\nmine had success putting the baby in  the stroller to nap and then was able to <br/>\nbring the stroller in the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve read an interesting idea recently about our work and hormone balance  <br/>\nand I must say when I remember to do it, it makes a difference!  Since as  <br/>\nSAHM&#39;s we don&#39;t really have defined times of &quot;work&quot; and &quot;off-work&quot;, we can  create <br/>\nthem by mentally defining work time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":241111941,"authorName":"ameliegoldstein","from":"&quot;ameliegoldstein&quot; &lt;ameliegoldstein@...&gt;","profile":"ameliegoldstein","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: failing at unschooling","postDate":"1133129663","msgId":7975,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRtZGIzditmNzF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1RURBMjE0LTg2QkMtNDI4MC05NENDLTFDQzYxNjUzODA4RkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":7973,"nextInTopic":7979,"prevInTime":7974,"nextInTime":7976,"topicId":7935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam, We like many stratgey games at our house too like Othello, chess, Go, and a game similar to Pente offically called Gomoku (although we just call it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-397066324\">Pam, <br/>\n<br/>\nWe like many stratgey games at our house too like Othello, chess, <br/>\nGo, and a game similar to Pente offically called &quot;Gomoku&quot; (although <br/>\nwe just call it connect-5). <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile my dd likes to play these games, and actually got a <br/>\ncomputerized chess game for her birthday at her request, she also <br/>\nlikes to play many of the roll-the-die type of games you mentioned. <br/>\nI don&#39;t mind them, and have developed a liking for Clue (which <br/>\ninvolves a little logic), but prefer the games mentioned above.

I am always on the look out for new things to do (remember, <br/>\nI&#39;m a spaz that loves to be busy).  This equates into local listings <br/>\nof activities, where I circle everything that looks interesting, run <br/>\nit past the other members of the house if I see something they might <br/>\nlike, then toss it into a pile of papers and forget about it until <br/>\ninspiration hits again! Once I get a bulletin board up, they&#39;ll be <br/>\nstuck onto that.<br/>\nI also had an &quot;idea list&quot; that I kept posted. If anyone came to me <br/>\nasking for ideas, I had a ready-to-go list of fun things they could <br/>\nchoose from. They usually didn&#39;t...but it would get them thinking <br/>\nand pretty soon they&#39;d be happily off in another direction.<br/>\nI offer activities whenever *I* feel like doing something, whenever <br/>\nI see something I think they&#39;d like or whenever the child is <br/>\nrestless and asking for something.<br/>\nI guess because I&#39;m always wanting to do something (usually cooking <br/>\nor art related) I will have interested children joining in almost <br/>\ndaily. BUT, I have two older boys that are quite content with their <br/>\nown activities. Trevor has joined us for almost nothing lately, <br/>\nJared a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Do you talk about goals and <br/>\nplan things together regularly?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nGoals? Like family goals or individual ones?  If one of the children <br/>\nhas an idea, we talk about how to achieve that...so it&#39;s pretty much <br/>\nas things come along.  If Markus and I think of some cool outing we <br/>\nthink the&#39;d like, we go to each of them and ask if they&#39;d like to <br/>\ncome.  We probably do some kind of family thing about once a week. <br/>\nWith Markus&#39;s work schedule in the past, it wasn&#39;t always that <br/>\nfrequent. We&#39;re unemployed bums right now, spending every single day <br/>\ntogether a family.:) Weekly outings are easy now, with smaller <br/>\noutings almost daily (Mom and two kids, or Dad and one kid etc..).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Is it &quot;normal&quot; to spend weeks or <br/>\neven months not doing much of anything?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES.  We go through really &quot;dormant&quot; phases, where we aren&#39;t very <br/>\nbusy, are happy with what&#39;s available at home, don&#39;t really feel <br/>\nlike trying anything new....then suddenly we&#39;ll all be off wanting <br/>\nto do a million things.  Busy seasons and quiet seasons. We aren&#39;t <br/>\nall timing it the same of course, but there is a family flow to this <br/>\nI&#39;ve noticed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Is it okay that we only <br/>\nplay a board game less than once per month?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly YOU can decide that!!

He must be happy with the choices he has, <br/>\nor you&#39;d know about it right?  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to wrap our minds <br/>\naround their very complicated games (ok, maybe that&#39;s just me) but I <br/>\nthink if we at least show a geniune interest to understand why they <br/>\nlove it, they can share their world with us.  12 is an age where <br/>\nboth my boys became a lot more independent....wanting to play their <br/>\nown games and do their own thing more. &#39;Course they have each other <br/>\ntoo.  <br/>\nEnjoy this time!!!

When they were younger, I  just had to <br/>\nsurrender to their needs and figure out how to make the best of  it.  My <br/>\nstructure was to get everyone fed and have some laundry going and a  bit of cleaning <br/>\ndone here and there.  Otherwise, I HAD to be on their  schedule.  My toddlers <br/>\nthat didn&#39;t nap would usually do so in the car if I  timed it well.  I would <br/>\ndrive until they slept and then parked and read  books or magazines!   When <br/>\nthe oldest didn&#39;t nap anymore, we would  park at home and play in the yard.  <br/>\nDidn&#39;t do much for getting things done,  but gave me some peace.  One friend of <br/>\nmine had success putting the baby in  the stroller to nap and then was able to <br/>\nbring the stroller in the house.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow that my kids are a little older, I get up before them and have some  &quot;me&quot; <br/>\ntime.  I&#39;m starting to implement the same idea of &quot;less available&quot;,  but mine <br/>\nis in the morning.  I can do a lot before they wake up and then  they are <br/>\nusually happy to play without much input from me for a bit.  I&#39;m  starting to <br/>\n&quot;enforce&quot; that a bit more because it makes me much more  mentally available in <br/>\nthe afternoon than when I have a running to-do list in my  head.  So, if my kids <br/>\nneed me in the morning, I&#39;ll stop what I&#39;m doing, but  if they just want me <br/>\nfor something, I say that I really want to do that, but is  it something that <br/>\ncan wait until the afternoon.  It has taken a few times,  but they are starting <br/>\nto get the idea and appreciate that I&#39;m really available  in the afternoons.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve read an interesting idea recently about our work and hormone balance  <br/>\nand I must say when I remember to do it, it makes a difference!  Since as  <br/>\nSAHM&#39;s we don&#39;t really have defined times of &quot;work&quot; and &quot;off-work&quot;, we can  create <br/>\nthem by mentally defining work time.  You start your &quot;work day&quot; by  saying to <br/>\nyourself, &quot;now I am at work&quot;.  You are probably doing the same  things as <br/>\nusual, but mentally declare yourself at work.  You should  probably take &quot;breaks&quot; <br/>\njust like you would at a job.  My children are also  my job, so if they need <br/>\nme, I am still on the job.  I just keep declaring  myself at work.  Then I <br/>\nbreak for lunch.  I say to myself &quot;now I am  taking some time for lunch&quot;.  I let <br/>\nmyself think about what has been  accomplished and feel proud for something <br/>\ndone for about a minute.   This shifts the hormones.  I take an hour for lunch <br/>\nand then mentally  &quot;go back to work&quot;.  Even if I am at the beach, or playing <br/>\nwith the kids, or  checking my email,  I keep telling myself that I am &quot;at work&quot;. <br/>\n After  a few hours, I repeat the process of feeling proud of my afternoon <br/>\nand that now  I am &quot;off work&quot;.  It really makes a difference in how I feel!  <br/>\nAgain,  what I am &quot;doing&quot; doesn&#39;t change, but just my thoughts about what I was  <br/>\ndoing.  I also felt less resentful of interruptions by the kids when I was  <br/>\nable to think, &quot;it is all part of the job&quot;.  I also notice that I usually  get <br/>\nmore done.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] more ideas on structure was failing at unschooling","postDate":"1133020911","msgId":7953,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0MwQjlEOTRDNjVEQi0xMzEwLTY1MENATUJMSy1NMDcuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEJGQUREQUJDLjMzOUQlYnV4Y2VsQHNpby5taWRjby5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":7952,"nextInTopic":7954,"prevInTime":7952,"nextInTime":7954,"topicId":7935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are 5 kids who enjoy lots of activities and a Dad that travels a lot.  So we have to have a plan.  We tried many different ideas on how to do that, kids giving feedback, adults giving feedback.  We finally have settled on having a list of what really needs to get done that day (it might have &quot;chores&quot;, such as feeding the dog, and it might have fun stuff, like calling to get directions to a sleepover).  Everyone in the family has a list and the only things on it are things that people have agreed to.  My kids liked this better than me asking for help throughout the day because it felt to them that I was &quot;always&quot; asking them to do something.  With the list, they say that they feel they have more control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think structure will look different for every family but the key is to listen to the family, look at what is going on, try ideas that are out of the box.  If somebody isn&#39;t happy then we need to take a look at how we as a family can re-arrange things, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest LOVES structure.  She is taking classes in writing, british lit and Spanish because she enjoys it.  I pay for it but I am not invested personally in it.  I support her and try to help make taking those classes as enjoyable for her as I can but it isn&#39;t MY activity.  I even tease her about how the only way an unschooler can rebel is to take classes.  She laughs, I laugh.

I just don&#39;t enforce that on my kids. They&#39;re developing their own<br/>\nlevels of structure. Cameron has a daytimer and a calendar to keep track of his very, very busy life. He <br/>\npurposefully *makes* time to meditate and drum and write letters to friends every day. He works---nothing<br/>\n9-5, but he has several parttime jobs to keep track of. Plus band practice and a girlfriend whom he sees <br/>\nevery day.<br/>\n <br/>\nStructure dos NOT mean that we enforce workbooks and lessons. It means that we have some organized plans <br/>\nfor the day/week/month/year. To not have some kind of structure to my day would mean not getting nearly as <br/>\nmuch done! Ren&#39;s teasing me that I&#39;m just spasoid! &lt;G&gt; No, I&#39;m just *high energy* and need to plan and <br/>\norganize MY stuff in order to fit it all in! <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have calendars or daytimers in every room! We&#39;re already planning all of next year&#39;s trips, birthdays, <br/>\nholidays, celebrations, etc. NOW, so that we can do what all we want to do. This also gives us some idea <br/>\nof what all we can accomplish as well as where to put $$ so that we don&#39;t run out before the end of the <br/>\nyear! Sometimes it means sacrificing a few things, but by planning we can decide what&#39;s more important.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen has set up this ATC trade. I&#39;m going to have to fit it into the schedule---pick a day or two, set <br/>\nup the (new) art room, gather supplies, (maybe order a pizza &lt;g&gt;), make sure everyone&#39;s set aside that time <br/>\nand that it doesn&#39;t conflict with work or school (Cam&#39;s schooled girlfriend is joining us). If I didn&#39;t do <br/>\nall that....well, it *might* get done, but it would probably be haphazard. I&#39;m NOT haphazard! &lt;g&gt; I won&#39;t <br/>\nschedule it and then expect everyone to work with what *I* decide: I&#39;ll need to work *with* all of us---AND <br/>\nget it done by Jan 8th. I work best with deadlines! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe have critters and gardens and ---well, just STUFF that needs to be cared for daily . I have classes <br/>\n(fencing) and clients (dog grooming) that need to be scheduled around.<br/>\n <br/>\nSome days (MOST days) I tell myself to do one big thing or two little things on my list. That could mean <br/>\nchecking on the bees and cleaning the dining room (two little things) or weeding the garden OR painting the <br/>\nbedroom (one big thing). That&#39;s just to cross things off my (ever-growing) list. I also need to set aside <br/>\ntime to read/write to Y&#39;ALL! &lt;G&gt; Not to mention laundry/cooking/cleaning/etc.---you know, regular stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe conference starts before the last conference ends! Contracts and plans, etc. I have &quot;count-downs&quot; as <br/>\nwe get closer, and I look forward to crossing things off lists! &lt;G&gt; Big thrill! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI NEED structure---I have too much to do without it. As busy as we ARE, I cannot imagine making someone <br/>\ndo workbooks or enforcing lessons. There&#39;s simply not enough TIME!<br/>\n <br/>\nI know my children will develop what THEY need in order to organize their lives---I watch it evolve as they <br/>\nfind how little time they have to do all the things the want to do. We&#39;re a busy family, and we all need to <br/>\nfigure out how best to work within the 24/7/365 thang.<br/>\n <br/>\nAm I spontaneous? Hmmmm....I spontaneusly decided to put on a conference, which took 13 months to <br/>\npull off that first year! &lt;g&gt; I spontaneously decided I wanted bees, so I did research and met beekeepers <br/>\nand, yes, got my bees! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;ve always wanted to raise a guide dog puppy, so we applied! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, yes, there&#39;s spontaneity---I&#39;ll pack up and take off for the beach if nothing else is planned for <br/>\nthat day. I&#39;ll just put off something else to another day! &lt;G&gt; The kids LOVE that kind of thing! Picnics <br/>\nin the park, painting their bedrooms---whatever.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut everyone is different. I don&#39;t think I could function without structure. Maybe Ren avoids it! &lt;Bwg&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n~KellyKelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1224177,"authorName":"Saulithyia@aol.com","from":"Saulithyia@...","profile":"saulithyia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] failing at unschooling","postDate":"1132939740","msgId":7941,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJkLjY1NDgwNWMyLjMwYjhhM2RjQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7939,"nextInTopic":7947,"prevInTime":7940,"nextInTime":7942,"topicId":7935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/24/2005 10:15:37 PM Eastern Standard Time, starsuncloud@comcast.net writes: Unschooling can work just fine with a child that needs","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-209465412\">In a message dated 11/24/2005 10:15:37 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can work just fine with a child that needs structure.  <br/>\nWhy would structure equal SCHOOL though?

All of the children I know that really, truly NEED what <br/>\nsome people call &quot;structure&quot; is knowledge of what is to come.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\n*I* need structure, and I&#39;ve been out of school for decades!<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m a lister---I have daily lists of all kinds of things that I want to get done by whenever.<br/>\n <br/>\nI have deadlines: small ones, like get into a hive before it gets too cold or bring the Christmas decorations in so I can get busy with that---and big ones, like signing hotel contracts and sending out speaker contracts. <br/>\n <br/>\nI have groom clients coming in every few days, so I&#39;m working around other people&#39;s schedules too.---Not to mention those of my sons and husband!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have food structures throughout the day and week: what to buy, when to fix it.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m redecorating my bedroom---paint/linens/design---all needs to be in place before I empty the room. That way I can get it done in two days! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have critters to feed and laundry to wash and fold and plants to water.<br/>\n <br/>\nArtist Trading Cards (due Jan 8th): designing and making and shipping. <br/>\n <br/>\nI have travel arrangements to plan (Ryan, our guide dog, goes back to achool on Monday). Car goes in this morning for service.<br/>\n <br/>\nWithout some kind of schedule/structure in my head or on paper, many of these things just wouldn&#39;t get done. But to think that I learned that in school is ridiculous!<br/>\n <br/>\nIn school, my days were sructured FOR me. I didn&#39;t have to think at all while there. I DID learn how to structure/schedule my day AFTER school so that I could squeeze in everything I needed/wanted to get done. But that had nothing to do with outside-imposed/managed structure.<br/>\n <br/>\nWell, except that I had *less* time to get done what *I* wanted/needed to do! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nWe each decide how much structure we need in order to do what we want to. My high need for structure probably enables me to do more than my friends who don&#39;t. But that&#39;s ME! It&#39;s not something that can be imposed on another with good results---just like learning!<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I were to tell my children what to do and when, they could do that. But watching *me* juggle several balls at one time and still take them where they need to go or play Scene-It with them or bake cookies too---THAT&#39;s how they will learn to schedule their time and find the structure *they* need.<br/>\n <br/>\nModelling the structure YOU need will enable them to develop the structure *they* need to do what all they want to. Most of us have an innate need for more or less structure---and I think it develops over time as we figure it all out. Forcing structure on others won&#39;t get them to &quot;do it our way.&quot; And it won&#39;t result in structured adults---but instead, those who look for structure from others.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196291069,"authorName":"Daniel MacIntyre","from":"Daniel MacIntyre &lt;daniel.macintyre@...&gt;","profile":"macintyred","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] failing at unschooling","postDate":"1132889982","msgId":7936,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxMmNiNDRlMDUxMTI0MTkzOWw0MGFhYmJkMG5kYzIwYWQ0Y2NkMDQ1YmQzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRtNXZoYysycjc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGRtNXZoYysycjc3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7935,"nextInTopic":7938,"prevInTime":7935,"nextInTime":7937,"topicId":7935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Ren!
