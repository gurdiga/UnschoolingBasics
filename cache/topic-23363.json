That if a child <br/>\nchooses their own food, they&#39;ll eat gummy bears and chips everyday, <br/>\nALL DAY LONG. That if a child has computer freedom, they&#39;ll either <br/>\nbe playing games all day or visiting porno sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nBullshit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have living, breathing proof in my house that it&#39;s not true.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacqueline gets up before I do most mornings and she helps herself <br/>\nto a light breakfast and then decides what she wants to do. Mostly <br/>\nshe&#39;ll watch a movie (she&#39;s big into Star Wars right now), work on a <br/>\nstory she&#39;s writing (it&#39;s her third) or play Barbies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI woke up the other morning and started making my morning tea. <br/>\nJacqueline yelled good morning from the family room and I asked her <br/>\nwhat she was doing. She replied that she was playing on the <br/>\ncomputer. Being she said &#39;playing&#39;, I thought she was on one of our <br/>\ngames like Sim City 3000 or Lilo & Stitch which of course would have <br/>\nbeen perfectly fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there she was, having fun with the scientific calculator that&#39;s <br/>\non the computer. The same scientific calculator that I didn&#39;t even <br/>\nknow existed until I saw her on it. In her world, playing around <br/>\nwith algebra, calculus and the table of elements is fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;ll notice in the picture, the breakfast she got for herself-<br/>\na banana and a low fat smoothie.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me make something clear....I don&#39;t think the table of elements <br/>\nis any more valuable than that Sim City game. In unschooling, <br/>\neverything has value and is important. <br/>\n<br/>\nI bring up these moments to silence the critics who think that <br/>\nunschooled children will never have an interest in learning anything <br/>\nunless they&#39;re being told to or that children cannot be trusted to <br/>\nmake their own choices. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where mindful parenting comes into play. Jacqueline is not <br/>\nleft alone to figure out things on her own. I&#39;m there, as her <br/>\npartner, her guide. I take my job as an unschooling parent seriously <br/>\nand I pour a lot of time, attention and respect into her.

This list is to help you embrace radical unschooling ( someone correct me if Im wrong on that ) Im far from an expert on this ...just pulled dd 7 from school a month  ago.....but thats why I read here. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Yesterday my daughter went to the bathroom and yells mom where is taiwan ? I was a bit boggled by this sudden question ...honestly i didnt even think she had heard of Taiwan. Turns out she picked up the plunger and read made in Taiwan on it. I showed her on a map then we ended up spending about an hour on the net looking at traditional clothing, foods and such . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Right this minute she and my 4 year old daughter are building a castle for the &quot;trash diggers&quot;( what she calls people in our area that look through trash cans for cans to sell and food) and I hear her saying welcome to the castle we have books and bean bags in here , and here is the snack room......my mommy will cook you dinner but you can come here and eat anytime you are hungry and if you dont like whats for dinner just come here and get some food. Unfortunatly she has know being 2 days away from homeless and only having ramen and beans in the pantry but just like everything else that is a part of her life good or bad....she learns from it. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  She refuses to read right now but wants me to read to her a lot. This eve well read more of what the moom saw . Not wanting to read dosent surprise me . At school she was not allowed to draw when finished with work and they were only allowed to read books So of course now she draws for hours.:) <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I have to 3rd...4th 5th? lol the reccomendation of declaring school over for the year. Unless you do everything possible to prevent learning...as most schools do imho.....no matter what she does she will learn . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So relax...check out www.sandradod.com and unschooling.com and others may have links also. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Can I e-mail you privately? I have some christian specific links that may intrest you ( the reason i asked if you were christian :) )<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

Watch her play piano or play drums or <br/>\nwrite or play runescape on the computer or just hang out and watch ants <br/>\ncarrying the bread that she breaks near their anthill back to feed their <br/>\nqueen. Watch how she learns from everything and from everywhere.

From the conversations during Fairly Odd Parents to discovering <br/>\nabout ladybug parasites to whatever else was going on in those few days. <br/>\nMaybe, after a few days with no curriculum you could try that. Just for a <br/>\nlittle while take notes on what your daughter is doing. Pay attention to <br/>\nwhat you talk about, what you look up on google with her, what you sing in <br/>\nthe car, what connections she makes and you make. And then let it go, and <br/>\njust live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve already decided that the curriculum isn&#39;t working. You are already <br/>\ncheating at it and it is clearly negatively affecting your daughter&#39;s self <br/>\nesteem:<br/>\n&quot;Then you have all the testing to give which I pretty much just let her use <br/>\nopen book because the questions can be difficult and she already has issues <br/>\nwith retention and is hard on herself about getting good grades.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you get a chance read and print out pieces from here to read when <br/>\nyou get a chance: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/\">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand from here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a huge amount on those two sites alone, lots of stories and advice. <br/>\nBut if you prefer holding something in your hand, reading a book in bed, buy <br/>\nRue Kream&#39;s book Parenting a Free Child (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freechild.info/)\">http://www.freechild.info/)</a> or <br/>\nSandra Dodd&#39;s book Moving a Puddle (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook)\">http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;lilak4&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lilak4@...\">lilak4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, April 24, 2007 1:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Is un-schooling for us? Need help ASAP!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Alright, I don&#39;t know too much about un-schooling but am wondering if<br/>\n&gt; it is something that might be better suited for my child.  I am<br/>\n&gt; starting to experience what I think is &quot;homeschool burnout&quot; but I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I originally took my daughter out of puclic school due to the fact<br/>\n&gt; that she was sooooo overwhelmed with all the work she has to do at<br/>\n&gt; school and then all the homework (3-4 hours practically every night),<br/>\n&gt; and then the stupid stress of studying for the TAKS and feeling<br/>\n&gt; pressured from the school to get a &quot;good grade&quot; (after all, they need<br/>\n&gt; every cent they can get and having better scores earns more<br/>\n&gt; $$)....then there were the kids, the trash talking horrible children<br/>\n&gt; who taught my daughter MORE than she should be worrying about at this<br/>\n&gt; point.  Then one of the teachers lied to me about something right in<br/>\n&gt; front of my daughter with me on the phone and the pricipal had the<br/>\n&gt; audacity to try and down play her actions....that was the straw that<br/>\n&gt; broke the camels back.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anyways I took my daughter out and started with a mesh of homeschool<br/>\n&gt; products...we found she likes Saxon math through all the different<br/>\n&gt; trial and errors on products...but that was just about it.  So<br/>\n&gt; feeling overwhelmed I started talking to another homeschool Mother<br/>\n&gt; who was using Christian Liberty as her curriculum and explained that<br/>\n&gt; she had been homeschooled through them also.  I felt suddenly<br/>\n&gt; inclined to start with them feeling that it was exactly what I needed<br/>\n&gt; to make our lives more organized.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When we received the CLASS program I had that sick feeling like it<br/>\n&gt; was going too be too much already and it has proven to be just that.<br/>\n&gt; Most of the books are pretty good but we have already had issues with<br/>\n&gt; the Math program and had to request them switching it from MCP to<br/>\n&gt; Saxon.  That takes about a month or so just to get one thing<br/>\n&gt; changed!!  Then you have all the testing to give which I pretty much<br/>\n&gt; just let her use open book because the questions can be difficult and<br/>\n&gt; she already has issues with retention and is hard on herself about<br/>\n&gt; getting good grades.  So then my daughter started to get really upset<br/>\n&gt; and felt like she was back in public school again because of all the<br/>\n&gt; work and all the different subjects there are.  I think there is like<br/>\n&gt; 8 or 9.  So we finally decided after lots of tears, that we would cut<br/>\n&gt; back to just focusing on completing one thing at a time.  I still<br/>\n&gt; havfe her doing Math everyday, a bible lesson and then only one other<br/>\n&gt; subject until she finishes the book and takes all the tests.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Well, honestly she still feels stressed and it is killing me.  I have<br/>\n&gt; a 22m old who is really active and needs my attention every waking<br/>\n&gt; minute.  I honestly have never been a fan of school and in a perfect<br/>\n&gt; world I would just rather have my daughter be who she wants to be,<br/>\n&gt; learn when she wants and what she really wants and dump all the<br/>\n&gt; rest.  I am not that creative when it comes to schooling or playing<br/>\n&gt; fot that matter.  I have prayed, cried, prayed, and cried some more<br/>\n&gt; over what I am doing wrong and to please change my attitude and heart<br/>\n&gt; towards education.  I DO NOT want to send my daughter back to public<br/>\n&gt; school because I don&#39;t think that is the answer.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am at my whits end over what to do.  My daughter is very musically<br/>\n&gt; inclined, takes piano, played drums, sings beautifully, loves drawing<br/>\n&gt; and writing....but....when she is asked to these things for school<br/>\n&gt; such as write a book report or essay...she just loses herself!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous break-down. I am hoping<br/>\n&gt; that maybe un-schooling is something that might be to our advantage<br/>\n&gt; but I need all the information I can get about it.  I don&#39;t have too<br/>\n&gt; much time during the day or evening to sit and look up too much<br/>\n&gt; because I am always needed or working or catching up on this messy<br/>\n&gt; house.  My husband talks about having more kids and at this point I<br/>\n&gt; would rather poke my own eyes out and light myself on fire!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I love my children dearly....and that is why I am here.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your help<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; B<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

Once your child<br/>\nis out, that&#39;s it. You are considered a private school, I believe, in<br/>\nTexas - the public school district no longer has jurisdiction. So, if<br/>\nthe testing and drilling are killing you, STOP. NOW. Take a LONG<br/>\nvacation. Give it a *minimum* of one month for every year of<br/>\nschool/school at home - that applies to the grownups too. That&#39;s the<br/>\nminimum of how long it takes to &#39;detox&#39; - yes, it takes time to get<br/>\nschool out of your system just like any other &quot;allergen&quot; or whatever and<br/>\nstart feeling whole and &quot;healthy&quot; again.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat does it look like in real life? Real Life. For someone who loves<br/>\nmusic, it&#39;s full of music. For someone who loves drawing and painting,<br/>\nit&#39;s full of drawing and painting. For someone who loves to read, it&#39;s a<br/>\nsea of books. For my DS (he&#39;s just shy of 9 and never been schooled), it<br/>\nlooks like lots of videogames and building with various things and being<br/>\nvery active. Tidbits of our days the last couple of days:<br/>\n <br/>\nSaturday: DS and I went to the co-op to shop for the week&#39;s groceries.<br/>\nThey stayed home and played/relaxed while I went to a bridal shower for<br/>\na friend&#39;s daughter. After I got home, we played a bit with vinegar and<br/>\nbaking soda and decided to move the action out to the back yard so we<br/>\ncould be a bit more &quot;explosive&quot; with things (try using a sealed<br/>\ncontainer for the reaction - blows the lid clean off!) DH went back in<br/>\nto finish up the dinner dishes and DS and I gathered some small bits of<br/>\nkindling and not-too-big bits of branch that had blown down in the<br/>\nrecent rain storm/nor&#39;easter and piled them in the fire ring in the<br/>\nyard. Then we hauled out the plastic lawn furniture benches and DH came<br/>\nout and we had a nice campfire and watched the dusk deepen to twilight<br/>\nand spotted the first bat of the season (YEAH BATS! They eat the<br/>\nmosquitoes).<br/>\n <br/>\nSunday: got up and went to church. DS and I inventoried the food pantry<br/>\nsupplies and made a list of what is running low so that can get<br/>\npublished and distributed. Then, after Bible classes, he helped me in<br/>\nthe nursery (it was my turn). He helped me keep things somewhat tidy -<br/>\nwe only had one toddler that day, so when he noticed she&#39;d stopped<br/>\nplaying with something and was two things down the road from it, he&#39;d<br/>\nput it away. He played with her, played some on his own. Helped her find<br/>\nher mom afterward while I did the last little bit of tidying. He played<br/>\noutside some for a bit, then we headed out - it was a BIG day Sunday,<br/>\nPokemon Pearl and Diamond were released for the Nintendo DS. So we<br/>\npicked up our reserved copies and went to Boston Market for lunch. DH<br/>\nand DS played on their games while I cleaned the kitchen. Which was<br/>\nactually more than I intended to do. I wanted to make some custom soaps<br/>\nfor my nephews and nieces (I promised them more a few months ago). That<br/>\nrequired cleaning off the whole table space. Once the table was clean,<br/>\nall the crumbs and such that had fallen to the floor needed to be swept<br/>\nup BUT there was stuff that needed to be dealt with before I could<br/>\nsweep. That in turn led to re-organizing the island and other surface<br/>\nareas. And so on until the whole room was done - DH asked me with<br/>\nhumorous concern if I was &quot;nesting&quot; (no, I&#39;m not pregnant!! It&#39;s just<br/>\nhis way of saying Wow that was a lot of work I didn&#39;t expect all that to<br/>\nget done in one lump). Then I got down to soap.<br/>\n <br/>\nA tidbit from a discussion with a friend that might be helpful: She said<br/>\nit was great that we had all these learning experiences for DS. I told<br/>\nher we don&#39;t think of them as learning experiences, we just do what<br/>\nlooks like fun.<br/>\n <br/>\nMonday: I headed off to work. My guys (DH is the at home parent) got up,<br/>\nplayed more on their games. Ate breakfast somewhere in there. Went to<br/>\nBurger King for lunch then headed off to a park day with our unschooling<br/>\ngroup. DS met up with one of his buddies in the group and played for a<br/>\ncouple hours. Then they decided that they needed to get together more,<br/>\nso they asked their respective parents to set up some time when they can<br/>\nget together. That&#39;s in the works. They played more after dinner while I<br/>\nexperimented with some different soap techniques. DH discovered that the<br/>\n&quot;Global Trade&quot; feature of the game is literally global - you can trade<br/>\n(through wi-fi/Internet connection) with people all over, he traded with<br/>\nsomeone in Japan! <br/>\n <br/>\nTuesday: they&#39;re playing, I&#39;m at work. Tonight after dinner we&#39;re going<br/>\nto the food co-op to work for a couple hours (co-ops run very much on<br/>\nvolunteers, and in this case we get a discount on our purchases for<br/>\nputting in x amount of hours in a month). <br/>\n <br/>\nIn all respects your household will probably look vastly different in<br/>\nthe specifics.

We are all free to pursue (or not) whatever interests us any time.  We have no schedules. Yesterday the kids wanted to walk across the street to the garden shop that just opened for the season and buy some annual flowers to plant. We wandered through the rows of plants choosing just the right colors of pansies, etc., and then we came home and spent the afternoon selecting just the right locations for our new plants and putting them in the ground.   Some days the children are happy playing together without mommy or daddy joining in...building blocks, plastic animals, dolls, video or computer games, TV,  riding bikes, reading  or whatever imaginary game they are having fun playing that day. Other days they want mommy or daddy to play along with them.  Some days we visit friends for play time, or we go on a field trip to a museum,  an aquarium, or the beach.. <br/>\nI enjoy my own interests too-  crafting, gardening, reading, etc., - sometimes the children join me in doing these things and sometimes they do their own thing. We talk, we laugh, we explore, and enjoy life.  Its amazing how many interesting conversations we get into that start with &#39; Hey mom, guess what happened on Sponge Bob Square pants today??&quot;   I notice the things my children are interested in.  Sometimes they are interested for a long time (weeks, months, or years), sometimes just for a hour or a day.  I help them explore their interests if they want me to by answering questions, offerering books, field trips.  I might just mention a fun field trip- sometimes they take me up on the idea, other times not.  We can go to the library for books, or the book store, or look things up on the internet.  My older son has spent many hours researching everything from prehistoric creatures, to automobiles, to the latest Pokemon characters on the internet. Because he wants to not because <br/>\nhe has to.   My other son who is interested in home design found a great internet based program for designing and decorating homes.   The point is that we are free to live life and pursue our interests regardless of whether they look like &#39;school&#39; or not. All sorts of learning happens whether we try or not.. I hope this helps.  Good luck!  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n  ,_._,___ <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304632297,"authorName":"Donna Vanderlip","from":"Donna Vanderlip &lt;donnavanderlip@...&gt;","profile":"donnavanderlip","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Is un-schooling for us?

We are in the process of pulling our kids from school.  It has indeed been painful and it seems so difficult to get things right.  I am a teacher and even so feel the frustrations of trying to meet learning needs of my children in just the right way.  My husband and I just finished reading Rue Kream&#39;s book...&quot;Parenting a Free Child&quot;  It is brilliant.  You will have to order it directly from her.  I also found a wonderful website called The Natural Child Project which has been enourmously helpful.  John Holt is a guru and you must read his book &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;  It is necessary to get support for what you are trying to do as it seems, from my very little experience, that the challenge is in facing what is hard for ourselves.
