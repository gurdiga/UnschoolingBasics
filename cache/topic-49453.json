Eventually, she may get tired of being made to perform and no longer want to see her grandmother (your grandmother?).

Grandma will probably still try to teach, but if your daughter is used to learning on her own terms, that won&#39;t be as big of a deal if most of their relationship is joyful. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] extended family","postDate":"1359118757","msgId":49456,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDgyRDhGNkMwLUExRUUtNERCNy04QzQwLTYyNkMzNTMxRjc3MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtkdDRkYisxa2JhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtkdDRkYisxa2JhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49453,"nextInTopic":49460,"prevInTime":49455,"nextInTime":49457,"topicId":49453,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You can then mention that it&#39;s your role to raise her but it&#39;s their role to spoil her ;-) They get to relax and not worry about any consequences of doing things purely for the sake of making her happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has a couple of good pages on relatives:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/relatives/responding\">http://sandradodd.com/relatives/responding</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/relatives/livingwith\">http://sandradodd.com/relatives/livingwith</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschooling to work you don&#39;t need to change the world. Unschooling is in the nest you create around her. If she&#39;s having a difficult time with a situation, be her buffer. But most people she meets will approach life differently. Let her experience that as long as she&#39;s having a good time.
