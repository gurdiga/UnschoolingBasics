You can do that,  <br/>\neasily, by jumping in to &quot;teach&quot; when unnecessary and/or unwelcome.  <br/>\nTRUST that natural curiosity will lead her to question, wonder, and  <br/>\nobserve and experiment and think for herself. Strew her path with  <br/>\nopportunities to have fun, to discover interesting things, and so on.  <br/>\nBut don&#39;t think that if you don&#39;t TELL her something, that she won&#39;t  <br/>\nlearn it.

I think that&#39;s all it takes <br/>\nis a genuine love of learning and curiosity that most people have; it&#39;s <br/>\njust buried a bit deeper for some than for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe glory of unschooling is that you live and learn with your kids--ALL <br/>\nof them. Learning is a by-product of living a rich, interesting life, so <br/>\nyou don&#39;t have to worry about how you&#39;ll &quot;teach&quot; the oldest or how much <br/>\ntime the little ones are taking. Life and interests intertwine, <br/>\nabsorbing all ages and stages. Sometimes it seems like the youngest ones <br/>\nlearn by pure osmosis because they absorb so much from the interests and <br/>\nquestions of the oldest ones, but then you see the same thing working <br/>\nthe other direction. Once they become available, you may want to order <br/>\nRen&#39;s conference talk &quot;Unschooling a Tribe.&quot; She said so many wonderful <br/>\nthings about what it&#39;s like to unschool many children--really valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spend most of my time at the AlwaysUnschooled list, which I co-own <br/>\nwith Robyn Coburn, and there are lots of people there talking about how <br/>\nthey do this with young children.

With the little ones still being so <br/>\ndemanding and unable to do very much by themselves, how do I provide <br/>\nher with a learning environment and &#39;be there&#39; for her when I&#39;m <br/>\ntrying to also take care of the youngest ones?    <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked at Danielle&#39;s inspiring and wonderful website and first <br/>\nthought, &#39;yay, her kids are spaced like mine; I can do this!&#39;.  And <br/>\nthen I thought, &#39;oh my God, she sounds incredibly smart and educated <br/>\nand resourceful---I am totally intimidated!&quot;  lol---Danielle, please <br/>\ntake that as a huge compliment from me!  But, for you and others who <br/>\ndid this with young children, I&#39;d love any words that will help me <br/>\nget my head around this idea.  I keep thinking about how I will go <br/>\nabout &#39;teaching&#39; my oldest when the little ones are taking up so much <br/>\nof my time: how do I let go of this way of thinking?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sticking with this long-winded post!  Oh, and my Madonna <br/>\npost was going to say, &quot;I see a Mommy Dearest-type movie in her <br/>\nfuture&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristina R---Mom to Isabel, Jillian and Dante</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7122,"nextTopicId":7188}}
