I have tried to relax. This is obviously a<br/>\n&gt; difficult issue for me. Progress is not a straight line. I&#39;ll get there<br/>\n&gt; but it&#39;s going to be a hard road.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Karen,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This morning on my run I was thinking about you! I had posted last<br/>\n&gt; week about how my dad was always a healthy, active guy and by him<br/>\n&gt; modeling such a life I naturally emulated it. My mom was less active,<br/>\n&gt; ate junk, watched A LOT of TV. I always saw the energy my dad had in<br/>\n&gt; comparison and knew that a healthy, active life was the route I<br/>\n&gt; wanted to take. However, when I was 20 I went through a rough spot in<br/>\n&gt; my life. I packed on some pounds and felt awful. Physically and<br/>\n&gt; mentally. I was working long hours, eating bad and not getting my<br/>\n&gt; workouts in. I lost focus on taking care of myself. After putting up<br/>\n&gt; with this for awhile, I finally decided no more. I started to eat<br/>\n&gt; right again. I resumed my work outs. I started to lose weight and<br/>\n&gt; feel really good about myself again. During that period of taking<br/>\n&gt; control and losing weight, I also became very angry at the fat<br/>\n&gt; america I was living in. My mom is an ex-smoker. I&#39;ve always been a<br/>\n&gt; non-smoker. Although I think smoking is disgusting, my mom holds much<br/>\n&gt; more judgment and anger surrounding the issue. If she could quit why<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t everyone else? I was this way with weight loss. In that time<br/>\n&gt; when I was losing weight I was so frustrated by those around me. Quit<br/>\n&gt; crying about your weight and do something for gosh sakes, I did! I<br/>\n&gt; was so against junk food being eaten all the time. I was militant and<br/>\n&gt; wanted only healthy food around. Years removed from the weight loss I<br/>\n&gt; am not so militant. Do I still think a healthy, active lifestyle is<br/>\n&gt; best? Absolutely! Do I want to impart that lifestyle to my children?<br/>\n&gt; Absolutely!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Maybe this isn&#39;t how you are feeling at all, but I wanted to share my<br/>\n&gt; experience during the time I was losing weight. I was angered with<br/>\n&gt; the Fat american epidemic and it feels like you are at that point<br/>\n&gt; too. Although, probably much more so since you have struggled with<br/>\n&gt; weight issues your whole life. Congrats on losing all your weight.<br/>\n&gt; That is amazing. Keep it up!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to type this with lots of commotion in the house. Dh is<br/>\n&gt; rough housing with the kiddos and we are about to walk out the door,<br/>\n&gt; so I hope it made sense.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Kendrah:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n&quot;Family isn&#39;t about whose blood you have.
