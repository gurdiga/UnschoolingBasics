I think it is to the great detriment of children and society as a whole that our educational system tells kids that they *have to* learn A, B, and C, and that all other knowledge and skills are not as valuable. I have also always hated the idea of learning for tests and grades, rather than for its own sake.<br/>\nKids see what people do and know in the world they live in, especially now, in the age of electronic media. Children who live in modern &quot;1st world&quot; societies basically have access to the whole world, through the internet, TV, and movies, as well as books. Even the poorest families in the U.S. and most English speaking countries can access the internet, DVDs and books through the public library system, for those who don&#39;t have/can&#39;t afford these things at home. (Most places that have public schools and compulsory attendance laws also have public libraries.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery child wants to learn what s/he needs to know, in order to pursue his/her own goals, and will, if given the freedom, resources, and encouragement to do so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the books and articles that inspired me when we first started homeschooling (which very quickly went from &quot;eclectic&quot;, creative homeschooling to unschooling) were:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Deschooling Society&quot;, by Ivan Illich (available online, for free),<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What Does it Mean to Be Well Educated? And Other Essays on Standards, Grading, and Other Follies&quot;, by Alfie Kohn,<br/>\n<br/>\nand a LOT of the articles written by Daniel Greenberg, one of the founders of the Sudbury Valley School in MA. There are a lot of great articles/essays about how children learn when given freedom, trust, and respect, on the Sudbury Valley School&#39;s website, sudval.org.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother aspect of unschooling that was always important to me is treating children with respect and courtesy, patience and kindness, and honoring their rights as human beings. In the public school system, and most private schools, the adults tend to treat the kids with the utmost DISrespect, and the schools are a veritable model of tyranny. There is a documentary called &quot;The War On Kids&quot; that I highly recommend watching. Parents who homeschool by doing &quot;school at home&quot; often tend to emulate that tyrannical system at home. I don&#39;t see how we, as a society, can expect kids to grow up as good citizens who understand and work to preserve equality, justice, freedom, compassion, and Democracy, when they are raised as virtual prisoners, slaves, and inconsequential peons. <br/>\n   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br/>\nYou asked what is/was done in our homes on a day to day basis. It varied from day to day, in our home. And there weren&#39;t very many days when we just stayed home. My kids participated in a variety of classes, outdoor play at parks, field trips, and recreational activities with other homeschoolers, or at local rec centers, or with scouts or synagogue youth groups. When the weather was nice, we went swimming often.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when we were at home, we did all kinds of different things. We watched TV/DVDs/online videos; did art and all kinds of crafts; played musical instruments; played board games, computer games, active games, and imagination games; rode bikes and went for walks; experimented with photography and making videos; I read aloud to my kids a lot; they played with friends in the neighborhood; they helped me with some of the housework. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they got into their teens, they started reading to themselves a bit more (and we still read aloud to each other), and started doing some creative writing. At about the age of 15 or 16, they each started to take some online high school level courses and studying/learning subjects that they found out they would need to know for college. They were still taking various classes outside the home, too. They learned some really interesting stuff in classes  including some basic computer programming, video editing and production, zoology/biology through classes at the zoo, advanced sculpting/pottery techniques, and they learned a whole host of skills and knowledge through participating in Venture Scouts. (My daughter got life guard certification through the scouts, and has a life guard job now.) We volunteered at a Shakespeare theater frequently (getting to see the plays for free), and attended plays at local colleges and high schools. My daughter and I still volunteer at the Shakespeare theater.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;daddyof2specialgirls&quot;  wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Good evening all!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am contemplating the idea of &quot;unschooling&quot; my two girls ages 10<br/>\n&gt; and 5.

By the time my daughter was a toddler, I was pretty sure unschooling was something I wanted to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t avoid the &quot;radical&quot; part of unschooling ;) The more I learned about learning, the more I realized that learning is a vital part of human nature and that learning is utterly dependent on the perceptions and perspectives of the individual. So it&#39;s not that teaching or rules or chores are &quot;bad&quot; it&#39;s that they&#39;re not effective in any kind of consistent manner - the results depend entirely on the interaction between personality, environment, and relationships. All the nuts-and-bolts of how unschooling works has to do with being sensitive to those factors. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe most wonderful thing I&#39;ve learned while unschooling is that it&#39;s Okay to be kind and sweet to my kids. That might not sound like much, but if you think of all the times and ways parents fight with kids, how often parenting is described as a struggle... You Don&#39;t Have To Do That. You can be your kids&#39; friend as well as their parent and it won&#39;t ruin them (a good friend! not the annoying friend who dumps problems too big to handle on you, the good friend who&#39;s always willing to help but doesn&#39;t get in the way). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I invite you to try a little bitty bit of unschooling: say yes more. Not about everything all the time and not at random - question your &quot;Nos&quot; and &quot;laters&quot;, your &quot;have tos&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; and rethink some of those. Find more options, more ideas, more ways to say yes. Just that. And life with your children gets sweeter and more peaceful.
