Not because it&#39;s hard to<br/>\nbelieve a child will eat mostly sweets...I have one of those. But to<br/>\nimagine a parent allowing a child to be malnourished just because<br/>\nhe/she exclusively prefers sweets...that&#39;s just not doing your job!<br/>\nWhy was he eating only processed foods? Why weren&#39;t you cooking/baking<br/>\nthings he liked that were sweet AND loaded with nutrition?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are loads of sweet things with nutritive value.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck, we had a casserole, pea salad and layered berry/cream dessert<br/>\nfor dinner last night.
