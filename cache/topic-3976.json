But yet I m beginning to feel like a pro","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-150268267\">Hi Karen,<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I would considered myself new too as its only been 10 months since we took our 7 yr old son out of school. But yet I&#39;m beginning to feel like a pro when it comes to following my son&#39;s inclination and confident that all loose ends will enventually tie itself in. So far, our days is still very much about playstation, looney tunes on tv, online games, surf the internet for more interesting games or cheat codes, the occasional meet -up with other HEing families and lots of walks to the local library near us. We&#39;re very much home-bodies, so we can very often get stuck in our pjs for the whole day, especially now that the weather is so horrible here in UK. We don&#39;t like to venture far too. So, recently, there&#39;s a new addition to our routine - son asked for ski lessons, and I&#39;m organising a once a month cooking classes for HEers and &quot;once a month&quot; outing with the ranger from the local conservation heathland. I organised this because it&#39;s something I know my son will enjoy but<br/>\n he&#39;s allowed to drop it, if he doesn&#39;t like it. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  He hasn&#39;t had any formal lessons especially maths since, we last took him out of school in December. But already, based on his PS2 and internet games and his weekly pocketmoney allowance, he very quickly understood the concept of addition, subtraction and division. He seems to pick up alot of science and physics concept from Looney toons (funny isn&#39;t it?), learnt his spelling thru Google surfing, and of course we watch alot of documentary shows on anything. As I like cooking and travelling, my son is very much exposed to alot of my favourite cooking and travelling shows. He watches my favourite-Grey&#39;s Anatomy, even though he doesn&#39;t really like it because he think&#39;s it&#39;s &quot;too violent&quot; but then it also means I&#39;ll have to sit and watch him playing his &quot;horribly boring&quot; Simpson game on his PS2.  Many a times, he&#39;ll just switch everything off and wander to the back garden, pretending to be a warrior or perhap stirring up some magic potion in his plastic &quot;cauldron&quot; (a huge<br/>\n plastic garden pot).  We also read alot. I still read anything and everything to him, at his insistence despite the fact that he&#39;s got very advance reading capabilities and can read anything including my magazines. Because we realised he could do this, we gave him his own monthly subscription Playstation Gaming magazine, and he loves it! Nowadays, he&#39;ll update (it&#39;s more like a &quot;hint&quot; to me on what he would like to buy!) me on the latest game on the market. So at the moment, we swing from Myth and Legends to joke books to latest games and how to play instructions magazines. On some weekend, he might be pottering about at the back garden, hammering away at his wood creation with his dad.   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I am of this belief that because my son is exposed to so many medium of information, predominantly the internet and tv, he also had so many questions, trying to make sense of his world. The past 3 months, all of a sudden after many months of quiet tv watching or game playing, we&#39;ve been having many questions/ discussion relating to Maths, history (ask us about Hindenburg the other day), geography (we&#39;re watching a documentary about India and trains when he asked what&#39;s the capital city of India?) and many more. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Before he ask for anything new to do, first he&#39;ll have to get bored and fed-up with whatever he&#39;s doing first. And trust me, they will eventually get tired of that tv, computer or game console, and will walk away to do something diffrent. Like my son when he&#39;ll switch the game console off and asked to be taken to the park so that he can play in the sandpit or go just window shopping at Toys&#39;r&#39;us so that he can plan what to buy with next week&#39;s pocket money, or just to go to the local supermarket for an iced bun just because he feels like it.      <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As you can see, our choice of activities is pretty limited, we don&#39;t do alot of outside/ sporty activities because that&#39;s the nature of me and my son (guess he took after me in many ways, other than the morning bit whereby my son&#39;s a early riser and I&#39;m not!). We&#39;re not sporty/ outdoor people. But our days are busy and myriad enough, filled with lots of interesting things around us to discover and talk about, like his fascination about the reflecting cat eyes on the road to the reflecting paint on the road signs, discussion about the sky and the world around us everytime we&#39;re in our car, shows to look out for on tv,  or information to search for on the internet. Occasionally we treat ourselves to the out of norm activity like trip to the cinema with pizza lunch. And this autumn, I&#39;m hoping to be able to catch a theatrical play or 2 with him. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I  agree what the everybody here been&#39;s telling you - eventually the child will search and ask for the specific skill they&#39;ll need to learn, in order to prepare for their choice of future.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Currently my son&#39;s obsession with Playstation and online games is leading him into animation and video making. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope this helps. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Best Regards,<br/>\n  SharonC<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n For ideas on reducing your carbon footprint visit Yahoo!

I think the deschooling process is the most difficult part of unschooling......even though I am a newbie as well so really don&#39;t have much experience or wisdom behind me.  But, it has been 4 months and I am seeing some progress with both Kora and Lukas.  It seems that Kora is reading again and starting to ask questions again.  She is having some amazing conversations with other adults and seems to be getting into the experience more and more.  Lukas continues to spend most of his time on screens yet can have some pretty amazing discussions about film making, graphics and seems to enjoy reciting the lines he remembers from movies.  What is difficult is the set backs I have with myself and my husband as we deschool.  Sometimes I wonder if my kids are happy, if they are spending too much time together, if they feel lonely because they are not with school friends and school activity.  Some days I get a<br/>\n flood of scary thoughts about the future.  So, it continues to be a process and I keep trying to trust that if they are not insisting on going back to school, unschooling must be meeting some of their needs.  Hope I am making some sense.  Just sort of feelin the need to support the beginners and receive support for the whole deschooling thing myself.

Abstract thinking and problem solving are things <br/>\npeople learn *despite* school, not because of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your oldest is interested in reptiles *right now*, take him <br/>\nplaces where he can see some critters - pet stores, for example. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to plan impressive &quot;field trips&quot; to zoos and science <br/>\nmuseums (although those can be fun now and again), you can go out <br/>\nfor lunch, stop at a pet shop or two and maybe another fun stop for <br/>\nyour other kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s interested in organic chemistry *right now* look into cheese <br/>\nor candy making or fermentation. Real chemistry experiments you can <br/>\neat. Heck, if *you&#39;re* interested in organic chemistry, try some of <br/>\nthose things for *you*. They&#39;re fascinating, and they&#39;ll keep you <br/>\nout of your kids&#39; hair while their learning ;) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, we are living in pergatory known as Panama City Fl.

And this when I work full<br/>\ntime as a software engineer, which is basically an<br/>\nextension of what I went to school for. It would be<br/>\neven more so for people who change fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing you can do for your kids is give them<br/>\nthe attitude of learning. They need to feel that they<br/>\ncan learn things when they need to. I know too many<br/>\npeople who think they cannot learn anything unless<br/>\nthey take a class. They&#39;re afraid to pick up a book or<br/>\njust try stuff. I think that&#39;s what school&#39;s teach -<br/>\nthe idea that you cannot learn without being taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
