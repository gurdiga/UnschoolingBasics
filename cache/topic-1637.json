So I guess in my mind I felt I somehow <br/>\nasked for it and feared her and my family disliking me rather than my hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n I did attend the hearing for my closure and my niece as she was out of state <br/>\nand is confused about her relationship with him. I ended up talking to the DA <br/>\nand found out I was still within the allowed years to come forward on my case <br/>\n(one smart thing I did do is report it but they didn&#39;t pursue it bc they <br/>\nthought I made it up, in the 80&#39;s they didn&#39;t look at rape the same as they do <br/>\nnow). I began the process of a statement in August but found out I was expecting <br/>\nso I chose to delay until after my delivery.  I dont know at this point what <br/>\nto do.. I just dont know if I want to put my self or family through the stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to answer you question after thinking more I think had I known he was <br/>\nbeating my sister (even pregnant with a baseball bat),rapeing her in front of her <br/>\nbaby with a knife and driving her down dirt roads telling her to get out and <br/>\nthat their was someone there to kill her.. I would have screamed it from the <br/>\nroof tops. She didn&#39;t tell anyone what he was doing until she left him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still carry guilt over all of this. If I had reported it right away and <br/>\nthey charged him his daughter would never have gone through the trauma that she <br/>\ndid. I just didn&#39;t have the family support to feel comfort enough to confront <br/>\nthem when it happened. Not to mention that she (my sister) and I had run away <br/>\nfrom home that week. The next week I was at my dads getting beaten (that&#39;s just <br/>\nwhat he did) and a week later he forced her to marry him bc she was pregnant. <br/>\nThere just wasn&#39;t any time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually think my mom thought well there ya go that&#39;s what you get for <br/>\nrunning away....<br/>\nI guess im rambling now but that&#39;s my thinking on the whys and why nots.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just dont know how I would handle the conversations with Cassidy. Right now <br/>\nshe will not talk to a stranger (and some we know) and I dont make her. I <br/>\nthink just keeping open communication is key right now. She (or any of my kids) <br/>\nhave never been without us unless they are at Grammy&#39;s.

He&#39;s ready if he&#39;s demanding to learn. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; An example is the Solar System.

He would point to each of the <br/>\nplanets and scream &quot;DIS&quot; until I would name what he was pointing at <br/>\nand soon he was naming all the planets in correct order.  And he has <br/>\nsince had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>\nuniverse and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>\nlook at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>\nasks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>\nthat we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** Laurie did this too (although not with the Solar System). She <br/>\ncalled it &#39;immersion learning.&#39; She&#39;d get interested in a topic and <br/>\nshe&#39;d check out every book on the topic from the library. I&#39;d have <br/>\nto help her carry them because they were so heavy. She still learms <br/>\nby immersion. She&#39;ll find out everything she can on a topic before <br/>\nshe goes on to something else. Sometimes, like when she&#39;s in <br/>\ncollege, she&#39;s learning everything she can about 5-8 topics at a <br/>\ntime. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill might enjoy seeing movies like Space Camp, Apollo 13, <br/>\nArmageddon, Space Cowboys (www.hobbyspace.com/Movies) and other <br/>\nspace travel movies. There are many sites online about space too. <br/>\nwww.space.com , www.heavens-above.com , www.nasa.com , <br/>\nwww.spaceflight.nasa.com  Is there a space center near you? Is there <br/>\na planetarium nearby? Is there any way you can get him a telescope? <br/>\n<br/>\n And then there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he <br/>\nwants me to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William <br/>\nbook,&quot;  (he sees his name on the front of the book).  But I can <br/>\nhardly understand it myself and so how on earth am I supposed to <br/>\ntranslate it for him? I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits <br/>\nand listens for as long as I will read it and only asks what <br/>\nspecific words mean not what is going on but my gosh, come on, this <br/>\nseems so weird that he wants me to read this to him. He cannot be <br/>\nunderstanding it.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** I love it! Is there a Shakespeare Festival near you so he <br/>\ncould see the plays that you have read? Maybe he is understanding it <br/>\nand he&#39;ll translate it for you some day. ;-) Two-year olds learn <br/>\nforeign languages so easily, so it&#39;s highly possible that he does <br/>\nknow what&#39;s going on. btw, this is exactly how Laurie learned to <br/>\nread. I read to her for 3-4 hours a day from books that were <br/>\nsupposedly too complex for her age. pfffffttttt <br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>\n&gt; frustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>child who has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; understand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>pull over, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while <br/>\nwe are driving).<br/>\n<br/>\n***** Is there a back road where you can let him do this? Explain to <br/>\nhim that you are letting him do it because there are no other cars <br/>\non the road. Laurie loved doing this with her grandfather, but only <br/>\non the backest of roads. The same with riding in the back of the <br/>\ntruck...something we did as kids all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;Isn&#39;t this crazy?

She grasps things <br/>\nso easily that I have to struggle with. BUT I am so so so much wiser <br/>\nnow than I was before I had her. I&#39;ve learned with her for 24 years <br/>\nnow. I didn&#39;t allow myself to feel stupid (and there were plenty of <br/>\ninstances where I could have felt that way) but instead focused on <br/>\nhelping her find out what she wanted to know and therefore learned <br/>\nit myself.

Her <br/>\nmother being a victim of his abuse (when married to him) talked to her daughter <br/>\nover the years and asked all the right questions and offered all the information <br/>\nshe could. <br/>\n<br/>\nA judge forced visitation and threatened to take custody away from her if she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t send the kids to see him across the US (she moved to avoid <br/>\nvisitation). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe judge&#39;s reasoning was that he had never been &quot;charged&quot;* for harming a <br/>\nchild. Years later at 16 the daughter told her mom but only after her friends and <br/>\nbrother talked her into telling. The visits included the brother but the <br/>\nfather always would wake her and say she was kicking him and bring her to his bed <br/>\nor he would send his son to the store or something. Scary but true.<br/>\n<br/>\n*The good news is that he was sentenced last year is now in a NH Jail. He <br/>\nawaits a trial in Utah (visited the kids in a hotel, yes there also). When he is <br/>\ndone in Utah he will be brought back to NH (we hope) for raping me when I was <br/>\n13. I didn&#39;t tell anyone myself for years because I was ashamed and in a <br/>\nfoster home for running away the week I was raped. He admitted to my sister what he <br/>\ndid and just said he wanted to know what it was like to have two sisters. <br/>\nSick I know.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both situations mine and my niece we both froze.

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re worried about sexual abuse or abduction.  The book covers both.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Stranger Danger&quot; is kinda a misnomer.  The danger usually comes from someone the child knows and who has built up trust with the child, i.e. relative, neighbor, teacher, family friend, etc.  The best way you can protect your child is to keep an open line of communication with them.  Make sure they know they should never go with someone without your permission.  If they are old enough, have a code word.  If Aunt Sue was to go by the house to pick them up when you weren&#39;t there, they&#39;d only go if Aunt Sue had the code word.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure your child knows no one except their doctor should be touching under where their swimsuit goes.  And that if someone does, or tries to, that they should tell you immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou encourage them to not keep secrets from you and if someone (an adult -- not another 6 year old) asks them to keep a secret, be sure they know to let you know what it is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the actual strangers -- same type of things.  At the park, they don&#39;t help someone look for a lost pet or child without you right there with them.  They don&#39;t accept candy from people they don&#39;t know, etc.  Please realize that, unfortunately, the danger is not usually a stranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nDON&#39;T sit your child down and have a lecture on it.  Blend it in with regular activities.  When you go to the park, play &quot;what would you do, if ...?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can call 1-800-4-A-CHILD for more specific information.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nTake Yahoo!

I would<br/>\nappreciate any insight and love to hear  how you all handle this and/or view<br/>\nthis.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nUnlike schooled children, who are apart from their mothers most of the  day <br/>\nand from early on, unschooled children are with us almost all the time.  Or <br/>\nwith a trusted friend/family member. We don&#39;t tell them to go off with  strangers <br/>\non a daily basis----like they do in school. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy younger son, never schooled, has a healthy fear of the unknown. My older  <br/>\nson, eight years at school,  is the one I&#39;d worry more about. We  pushed <br/>\nshaking hands with strangers, making eye contact, and other &quot;adult&quot;  greetings for <br/>\nstrangers with Cameron (16). Duncan (8) is wary of people who come  up to him <br/>\nand stick out their hands in greeting. I think that&#39;s more of a normal  <br/>\nresponse from a child---if you really think about it. But we seem to push that  <br/>\n&quot;firm handshake/eye contact&quot; greeting dangerously early, IMO.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere just isn&#39;t much of an opportunity for Duncan to be alone with a  <br/>\nstranger. Not  like there was for Cameron, who was gone most of the day on  a campus <br/>\nfull of strangers (not to mention field-trips!).<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd age has very little to do with it. I know of an 18 year old girl  <br/>\n(legally an adult) who disappeared 12 years ago. I used to babysit her and her  <br/>\nbrother.  God! Dale would be 30 now!<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ll tell Duncan and Cameron how icky somebody we meet makes me feel. How  <br/>\nthere&#39;s something about that guy that makes me uncomfortable. How I just don&#39;t  <br/>\ntrust so-and-so. I never make them kiss or hug strangers or even family <br/>\nmembers  if they don&#39;t want to. I like for them to tell me when someone makes them  <br/>\nuncomfortable too, and I make sure I&#39;m right there if we have to deal with <br/>\nthis  person again for any reason.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy father&#39;s a shrink. He was the forensic psychiatrist for SC for several  <br/>\nyears. As Cameron&#39;s gotten older, I tell him stories of weirdos my father knew.  <br/>\nPeeWee Gaskins was a real winner. This freak actually wrote a book. A couple <br/>\nof  scenes stand out in my mind. Cameron&#39;s 16 and has a car, so I think he&#39;s <br/>\nmore  than ready to know the more graphic stories I&#39;ve told him. He&#39;s very  <br/>\ntender-hearted, so I DO worry about his picking up hitch-hikers or handing out  <br/>\n$$ to panhandlers. But he&#39;s also level-headed and really listens to me when I&#39;m <br/>\n worried. He&#39;s at the beach this weekend. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m OK. PeeWee&#39;s dead.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think just having them WITH you makes a huge lot of difference. As they  <br/>\nget older and more able to handle details, then you can give more  information.<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":24323633,"authorName":"Laura Gates-Lupton","from":"Laura Gates-Lupton &lt;Laura_Gates@...&gt;","profile":"Laura_Gates","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about &quot;Stranger Danger&quot;","postDate":"1089488164","msgId":1722,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNzEwMTkzNjA0LjYzNDg4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEyMTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEhJRVBLT09FRUlBSUJISFBKRUJQTUVORUNOQUEuc2FsZ2Vub3Zlc2VAd29ybGRuZXQuYXR0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":1720,"nextInTopic":1724,"prevInTime":1721,"nextInTime":1723,"topicId":1637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a book recommendation for you.

For instance, Mackenzie was really *really* into trains. I have a clear memory of standing by some railroad tracks with a whole bunch of broken down engines. Mackenzie was around 21 months old, I think. He was trying to tell me something, but I couldn&#39;t understand him, it sounded like &quot;Mally&quot;. He got so angry, he stamped his little foot and said &quot;Mally, mama, Mally! Two sets driving wheels!&quot; It was only a month or so later when I came across a book that mentioned that the &quot;Mallet&quot; steam locomotive (named after its inventor, Antoine Mallet) was distinguished primarily by having two sets of driving wheels and pistons, instead of one. Whoa, talk about a lightbulb moment! He was ready for much more information than I even fully understood at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother time at around the same age just after a trip to the gas station, he asked me how our car engine worked. When I started with a simplistic description he interrupted and asked imperiously how it *really* worked. So I started with the gas tank and talked him through the fuel lines, fuel injectors, cylinders, pistons, exhaust valves, cam shaft, etc. I thought to myself that there was no way he could&#39;ve understand any of what I was saying, but I told him none the same. A couple of days later at a playgroup he was jumping up and down in a foam cylinder yelling &quot;Look mom, I&#39;m a piston!&quot; So from my verbal description, he was able to construct in his head a pretty accurate idea of what a piston does in a cylinder. After that, I made no more assumptions about what he was or wasn&#39;t ready to learn and have always just answered his questions fully to the best of my ability or said &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s look that up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my advice with your son would be to start by tossing out the assumption of &quot;readiness&quot; and just go with what he&#39;s interested in. Chances are, he might have some pretty deep interests that he really delves into, but a few months or years later he might move onto something else - so don&#39;t get too attached to the things he is fascinated with, just go with the flow. The train thing lasted several years for Mackenzie, but I think now if I asked him what a &quot;Mallet&quot; was, he might not remember. That&#39;s okay though, as long as he was interested in the knowledge then, it has some place in his life long-term, whether he retains the specifics or not. To this day, he can look at some kind of device and the wheels start turning in his brain, he just has to figure out how it works, how the gears mesh, what makes it tick. He just has that ability to mentally take things apart and figure out how they work. Since he&#39;s the son of an airplane mechanic (DH) and a former software geek (me), it is not surprising I guess!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; An example is the Solar System.  He was 14 mos old when he found a <br/>\n&gt; map of the solar system in a book.  He would point to each of the <br/>\n&gt; planets and scream &quot;DIS&quot; until I would name what he was pointing at <br/>\n&gt; and soon he was naming all the planets in correct order.  And he has <br/>\n&gt; since had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>\n&gt; universe and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>\n&gt; look at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>\n&gt; asks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>\n&gt; that we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This makes sense if you think of the ways young brains acquire information. Something like the planets is basically memorization, something young kids do relatively easily. After all, they master thousands of words in the English language in their first few years. At that age, Mackenzie knew all of the states on our U.S. Map puzzle, but when we went to Florida to visit his grandparents, he couldn&#39;t get the idea that we weren&#39;t still in Washington state. His world view wasn&#39;t big enough to extrapolate the things he&#39;d memorized on the map to actual places that were on a big round planet that were thousands of miles apart. Your son will get it eventually, but it will take a lot of little building blocks of facts and understandings before his brain is ready to grasp such an abstract conceptual fact. You can still keep explaining though, and feeding his thirst for the knowledge, just don&#39;t have the expecatation that because he can understand some facts very easily and quickly that more abstract facts will also be ready to fall into line, it might take some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Today he <br/>\n&gt; asked me who is John Kerry and I told him he wants to be president <br/>\n&gt; and he said &quot;George Bush is our president.&quot;  And then &quot;What is a <br/>\n&gt; president?&quot;  How am I supposed to explain that to a 2 year old? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I just told my kids that he&#39;s the leader of the place that we live in. And that we get to choose who the leader is, every few years. So the leader might change. As they have gotten older, my explanations have gotten much more complex to keep pace with what they can understand. Right around when my daughter turned two is when September 11 happened, now *that* was difficult to explain! Some things are tough, and you just need to find ways to break it down to the point where they can grasp it. You can always add more later when they&#39;re ready for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And <br/>\n&gt; then there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he wants <br/>\n&gt; me to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William book,&quot;  (he <br/>\n&gt; sees his name on the front of the book).  But I can hardly understand <br/>\n&gt; it myself and so how on earth am I supposed to translate it for him?  <br/>\n&gt; I mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits and listens for as long <br/>\n&gt; as I will read it and only asks what specific words mean not what is <br/>\n&gt; going on but my gosh, come on, this seems so weird that he wants me <br/>\n&gt; to read this to him. He cannot be understanding it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He doesn&#39;t have to, to enjoy it. I was a very early reader and at a fairly young age was mowing through every book in our house. Lots of what I read I didn&#39;t understand (I remember reading &quot;Incredible Victory&quot; in grade school, for instance.) I didn&#39;t have the context to grasp a lot of what I read, but that didn&#39;t dampen my enjoyment of it. I would just continue reading it, you might be surprised at how much he&#39;ll get out of it. When my son first started getting interested in ancient Roman history last year, he was fascinated by Julius Caesar. I told him that this man named Shakespeare had written a play about Julius Caesar and he says &quot;I know mom, that&#39;s where that quote about unleashing the dogs of war comes from.&quot; Turns out, we had read &quot;Watership Down&quot; a year or so prior, and it had several quotes from Shakespeare in it, including the famous &quot;dogs of war&quot;  one. You never know what they store away in those memory banks! That&#39;s part of the beauty of unschooling to me. Since they&#39;re not told what is and isn&#39;t important, what connections they have to store and which they don&#39;t, because their brains aren&#39;t stuffed full of knowledge that they may or may not need, they are free to make the most marvelous and intriguing connections between the things that they hear, learn, or read, and are passionate about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>\n&gt; frustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a child <br/>\n&gt; who has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>\n&gt; understand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I pull <br/>\n&gt; over, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while we are <br/>\n&gt; driving).  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Relax, this is totally normal! Kids thirst for knowledge comes well before their aquisition of an adult-like world view. Conceptual things like why mom can&#39;t hold them while driving or where the earth is in relation to other planets will come with time. In the meantime, just keep answering questions to the best of your ability, and offer to look up anything you don&#39;t know. In time, he&#39;ll be looking stuff up himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And he gets so frustrated w me!  Today he asked for his <br/>\n&gt; money and I gave him his bank.  He was counting pennies and <br/>\n&gt; said &quot;Mama give me 700 million bucks.&quot;  I laugh, tell him I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; have that kind of money and he gets SO MAD demanding that I give him <br/>\n&gt; 700 million bucks.  Finally I wrote him a check and that did calm him <br/>\n&gt; down!  Isn&#39;t this crazy?  Do any of you have a kid like this? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about other folks, but this sounds like pretty normal 2 y.o. behavior to me. They are not really rational beings, LOL. When they are bright and inquisitive, it just gives them greater ability to find things to drive you crazy with. But this is a good thing. Sometimes, at that age, the best you can do is reflect their feelings back to them and offer alternatives. &quot;You&#39;re frustrated because you&#39;d really like me to give you 700 million bucks, but I don&#39;t have that much money. We can make play money together, or I can write you a check.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I <br/>\n&gt; would love to find another Mama to talk to who has dealt w this kind <br/>\n&gt; of thing. Sorry for all the rambling but I am feeling highly <br/>\n&gt; frustrated and stupid and am really hoping to hear a btdt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, 2 year olds can be quite a handful, especially if their brains are going a million miles a minute, but they don&#39;t really have the context yet to understand what limitations there are in the real world. It&#39;s great to have this kind of inquisitive and imaginative child, but they can be a challenge. Keeping up with their quest for knowledge is definitely a full-time job! I have definitely dealt with this two times around now (my youngest is almost 5) and at times it has really tried my patience and other times has been the most incredible thing I&#39;ve ever been a part of. It sounds like William is an amazing kid who will keep you on your toes for many years to come. Kids like this make it easier in many ways to unschool because their natural curiousity takes them in so many fascinating directions. The challenge is how to fit in everything that they want/need to learn/do/see/experience. Just cut yourself and William some slack, don&#39;t expect that because his brain is motoring along that his world view will keep pace. Even with a very inquisitive brain, it just takes time to aquire the knowledge and make the connections to begin to understand the world around you. Kids like this will test every single assumption you might have, but the journey is very worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlue Skies!<br/>\n   -Robin-<br/>\nRadmama to Mackenzie (8/28/96) and Asa (10/5/99)  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] premature interests","postDate":"1089467127","msgId":1716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMC4xYjc3ZTI3MS4yZTIxNGNmN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1715,"nextInTopic":1719,"prevInTime":1715,"nextInTime":1717,"topicId":1637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/10/2004 9:30:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  writes: ***He  found my copy a while ago and he wants me to read it to  him every day  because","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1205190545\">In a message dated 7/10/2004 9:30:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time,  writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n***He  found my copy a while ago and he wants <br/>\nme to read it to  him every day  because it is a &quot;William book,&quot;  (he <br/>\nsees his  name on the front of  the book).***<br/>\n <br/>\nWilliam Wegman&#39;s photo books with Weimaraners. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe also happened upon several books written by a woman names  Pamela Duncan <br/>\nEdwards---because of the name Duncan on the cover.

But I am confused about <br/>\nWilliam.  I see you guys talking about how kids will approach things <br/>\nwhen they are ready, but it seems like Will is hungry and demanding <br/>\nto learn things before he is ready...<br/>\nAn example is the Solar System.  He was 14 mos old when he found a <br/>\nmap of the solar system in a book.  He would point to each of the <br/>\nplanets and scream &quot;DIS&quot; until I would name what he was pointing at <br/>\nand soon he was naming all the planets in correct order.  And he has <br/>\nsince had out every book our library has on the solar system and the <br/>\nuniverse and will tell you all sorts of amazing things.  Yet when we <br/>\nlook at the night sky, he points to Venus and Mars and always <br/>\nasks &quot;Where is the Earth.&quot;  I have explained every way I know how <br/>\nthat we are on Earth and he just doesn&#39;t seem to get this.  Today he <br/>\nasked me who is John Kerry and I told him he wants to be president <br/>\nand he said &quot;George Bush is our president.&quot;  And then &quot;What is a <br/>\npresident?&quot;  How am I supposed to explain that to a 2 year old?  And <br/>\nthen there is Shakespeare.  He found my copy a while ago and he wants <br/>\nme to read it to him every day because it is a &quot;William book,&quot;  (he <br/>\nsees his name on the front of the book).  But I can hardly understand <br/>\nit myself and so how on earth am I supposed to translate it for him?  <br/>\nI mean, I guess I don&#39;t have to, he just sits and listens for as long <br/>\nas I will read it and only asks what specific words mean not what is <br/>\ngoing on but my gosh, come on, this seems so weird that he wants me <br/>\nto read this to him. He cannot be understanding it.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know what my specific question is here I guess I am just <br/>\nfrustrated and rambling.  It is so weird to be dealing with a child <br/>\nwho has learned to read and tell time etc at 2 but yet cannot <br/>\nunderstand that I cannot hold him while we are driving. (yes, I pull <br/>\nover, that isn&#39;t what he wants...he wants me to hold him while we are <br/>\ndriving).  And he gets so frustrated w me!  Today he asked for his <br/>\nmoney and I gave him his bank.  He was counting pennies and <br/>\nsaid &quot;Mama give me 700 million bucks.&quot;  I laugh, tell him I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave that kind of money and he gets SO MAD demanding that I give him <br/>\n700 million bucks.  Finally I wrote him a check and that did calm him <br/>\ndown!  Isn&#39;t this crazy?  Do any of you have a kid like this?

I wouldn&#39;t use the &quot;daddy&quot;  analogy, <br/>\nbecause president&#39;s change, and it could lead to thinking that daddy  could <br/>\nchange, too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nStill, it&#39;s a good idea to relate things to his actual life...perhaps you  <br/>\ncould help him notice that the mail carrier changes from day-to-day (ours does), <br/>\n that the mail carrier is the &quot;caretaker&quot; of the mail, in the same way the  <br/>\npresident is the &quot;caretaker&quot; of the country.  Or the sanitation workers or  the <br/>\ngrocery store bagger or another person your son sees regularly.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs for whether you know something or not...how about saying, &quot;Let&#39;s find  <br/>\nout!&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Read him the Shakespeare.  When he  asks for <br/>\nmeaning of a word you don&#39;t know, show him the dictionary and offer to  look it <br/>\nup.  It may be that he will choose to look at the dictionary and go  off on a <br/>\ntangent that way, or he will rather hear the story.  Does it  really matter if <br/>\nunderstands the story or not?  He&#39;s learning things and he  obviously has a <br/>\nthirst for knowledge.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for where&#39;s Earth in the night sky...have you ever just pointed at the  <br/>\nground instead?  How can he understand he can see Venus and Mercury and not  <br/>\nPluto?  How about drawing a picture of the solar system and then drawing a  <br/>\npicture of you and him on Earth?  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt sounds like it&#39;s going to take a lot of imagination with this kid. AND  an <br/>\nability to discern his real questions.  I will say that most 2-4 yo&#39;s  will <br/>\nask questions over and over just to get a reaction, and if he sees you&#39;re  <br/>\ngetting frustrated it may be paying off for him in some way...whether it&#39;s  <br/>\nknowing that he has your full attention as long as you&#39;re frustrated and  <br/>\nexasperated, or he likes the intellectual stimulation of the argument.  I  would <br/>\nencourage you to think about your answers to his questions  carefully.  Many times <br/>\nwhat kids are saying is not what they&#39;re really  asking.
