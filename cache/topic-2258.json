There could be underlying reasons <br/>\nfor certain fears, but most likely it is just his temperament and <br/>\nthe way he responds to things.  My son is 5 1/2, who has been raised <br/>\nAP from day one, has similar issues.  It sort of ebbs and flows with <br/>\nhim...I have always likened it to be that his intellectual capacity <br/>\nis ahead of his emotional capacity (this is just my interpretation <br/>\nof it).  Nonetheless, it can be very hard to watch your child being <br/>\nfearful.  I do hope we can help him alleviate these fears eventually <br/>\nby just providing him with support, comfort and security....but it <br/>\ndoes get very trying.  Here is something from Dr. Sears&#39;s website:<br/>\n<br/>\n7 WAYS TO HELP YOUR CHILD HANDLE FEAR<br/>\nHelping children overcome fears not only eases their anxieties, it <br/>\nalso provides an opportunity to build the parent-child relationship. <br/>\nAs you and your child work through fears together, he learns to <br/>\nregard you as a valuable source of support. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. Understand why children are afraid. Children do not think like <br/>\nadults. Most of the world is unknown to the child; and children, <br/>\nlike adults, fear the unknown. The preschool child cannot reason <br/>\nthrough each new experience and decide what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s <br/>\nthreatening. As if the real world were not scary enough, the ability <br/>\nto form mental images, which develops from two to four years, opens <br/>\nthe world of magical thinking with its consequent fearful <br/>\nfantasies . Two-to-four-year-old children are able to recreate <br/>\npeople, animals, and things, which they are exposed to in real life <br/>\nmentally, and these mental images may be scarier than the real <br/>\nthing. The cute daytime dinosaur may reappear in fantasy form as a <br/>\nmonster at night, producing the sleep disturbances so common at this <br/>\nage. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability to imagine monsters without the ability to reason them <br/>\naway as imaginary creatures results in a developmental stage where <br/>\nlittle persons are likely to have big fears. Fears vary from child <br/>\nto child. One child&#39;s fear is another&#39;s fascination. Some children <br/>\nlove to play with the vacuum cleaner. Other kids regard it as a <br/>\nnoisy monster that eats things. The school-age child becomes more <br/>\nafraid of changes in relationships, danger, and health issues (e.g., <br/>\nbeing hit by a car, not being able to breathe, divorce of parents, <br/>\nor death). Children become fearful at different ages, at different <br/>\nintensities, and about different things. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our family, once we started practicing sleep-sharing sixteen <br/>\nyears ago, we didn&#39;t have monsters in the bedroom, but Hayden and <br/>\nErin did go through a stage when they were scared of the dark . When <br/>\nMatthew did not develop this fear, we wondered why. When it finally <br/>\ndid show up, he was old enough to understand an explanationÂ—we told <br/>\nhim he was scared because his imagination was growing. He liked <br/>\nbeing able to understand his fear, and it seems to us that he grew <br/>\nout of it quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nFear is one of the earliest emotions, and with a little help from <br/>\ncaregivers, the child can turn this unpleasant feeling into an <br/>\nopportunity for emotional growth. Learning to deal with fears is one <br/>\nof the child&#39;s earliest lessons in dealing with emotions and using <br/>\noutside help. Understand and support your child during these times, <br/>\nand the closeness between you will grow. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Give a fearless message. First, what not to do. Don&#39;t give your <br/>\nchild the message that it&#39;s wrong to be scared. To a growing child, <br/>\nthis translates into &quot;something&#39;s wrong with me.&quot; Avoid putdowns <br/>\nlike: &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid,&quot; &quot;Stop being a baby,&quot; &quot;Big boys (or girls) <br/>\ndon&#39;t get scared.&quot; These don&#39;t put out the fears they only drive <br/>\nthem underground. Now the child is not only afraid of the dark, but <br/>\nhe&#39;s also afraid to tell anybody about his fear, or seek help with <br/>\nhandling it. What began as a normal childhood problem is now <br/>\nchipping away at his ability to trust others. Without reinforcing <br/>\nyour child&#39;s fears, empathize with them: &quot;When I was a child I was <br/>\nafraid of a dark bedroom, too.&quot; Acknowledge your child&#39;s fears in <br/>\norder to help her work through them. Strike a balance. Don&#39;t ignore <br/>\nthe fears, but don&#39;t get over-involved in them either, or your child <br/>\nwill play up the fear to get your attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen responding to children&#39;s fears, give them two messages: It&#39;s <br/>\nall right to be afraid; and it&#39;s good to share your fears and ask <br/>\nfor help. Reassure your child that &quot;Mom and dad (or trusted adult) <br/>\nwill keep you safe.&quot; Remember not to put your child down by <br/>\nsaying: &quot;There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s silly.&quot; Never <br/>\nuse or create fears to discipline your child: &quot;The boogie man will <br/>\nget you if you get out of bed&quot; or &quot;God will punish you if you talk <br/>\nback.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Model being unfearful. Helping your child handle fears is much <br/>\neasier if you are closely connected with your child. Your child <br/>\nregards you as a test pilot. If something or someone is safe for <br/>\nyou, then it is safe for the child. Stranger anxiety is common <br/>\nbetween one and two years. Help your child overcome this fear by <br/>\nmirroring to the child that this new person is okay. Many children <br/>\nbecome fearful of insects because they see an adult freak out when a <br/>\nJune bug buzzes by. Same for lightning and thunder. Try singing &quot;My <br/>\nFavorite Things&quot; during a storm to help you stay calm. To handle <br/>\nfear of doctors , prior to your visit, let your child explore a toy <br/>\ndoctor&#39;s kit. Play doctor and go through a pretend examination so <br/>\nyour child knows what to expect. Let the child play doctor with his <br/>\npet, doll, or stuffed animal. <br/>\n<br/>\n4. Always take your child&#39;s fear of caregivers seriously. Normally, <br/>\nfamiliarity lessens fear. If your child&#39;s fear at being left with a <br/>\nparticular caregiver, even a relative, is getting more intense, <br/>\nchange caregivers. Even if foul play seems unlikely, give your child <br/>\nthe benefit of the doubt. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. Ease bedtime fears. Nighttime is scary time for little people. <br/>\nFear of the dark and of separation from parents is a double fear <br/>\nthat keeps many children awake. Put on a night-light. Parent your <br/>\nchild off to sleep with a soothing story, massage, or song. Leave <br/>\nrelaxing tapes playing for an hour or so after bedtime. Young <br/>\nchildren need these helpers because they cannot use their minds to <br/>\novercome their fears. The child over four can be helped to work <br/>\nthrough the fear of darkness. Ask him to tell you what &quot;dark&quot; means <br/>\nto him. Encourage the child to draw the fear: &quot;Draw what your dark <br/>\nroom feels like and looks like.&quot; If you get a black sheet of paper <br/>\nwith an orange monster under the bed, you&#39;ve pinpointed the fear. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe principle of gradually increasing exposure helps the child <br/>\novercome fear of the dark. Play dark tag, beginning with the lights <br/>\non in a room that preferably has a dimmer switch so that you can <br/>\ngradually dim the lights. Play hide-and-seek at dusk, and let the <br/>\ngame extend into the darkness. Play follow the leader as you weave <br/>\naround the yard at night on an exploring expedition. Initially, hold <br/>\nyour child&#39;s hand as you explore together. Give your child his own <br/>\nflashlight to keep next to his bed so that he can turn it on to shed <br/>\nlight onto suspicious piles of clothing that turn into &quot;a bear&quot; when <br/>\nthere&#39;s no light. Sometimes just knowing that he has the power to <br/>\nchange the darkness into light is enough to quell the fear. Or just <br/>\nleave a light on his room; it won&#39;t interfere with his ability to <br/>\nsleep. He&#39;ll start turning it off himself when he&#39;s older. <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Chase &quot;monsters&quot; out of bedrooms. &quot;Daddy there&#39;s a monster in my <br/>\nroom.&quot; Is this a real fear or another trick for prolonging bedtime? <br/>\nThe empathetic parent treats the child&#39;s concern as real. Here&#39;s how <br/>\nto get the child out of the fearful state and ease him into a <br/>\nsleeping one. Let the child describe the monster and tell you <br/>\nexactly where it is. Walk around the room together, letting the <br/>\nchild share his worries. Realize that fearing monsters is a <br/>\ndevelopmental stage in which the monster stands in for a frightening <br/>\nworld. Childish fears being what they are Â– illogical Â– an <br/>\nexplanation may not work. A more imaginative response is called <br/>\nfor: &quot;I&#39;m the dad in this house and I don&#39;t allow monsters in here. <br/>\nHe&#39;ll have to leave.&quot; Then you step into the closet and have a brief <br/>\ntalk with the monster. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo these kinds of responses mean that you have &quot;caved in&quot; to <br/>\nchildish behavior? No, they don&#39;t. They mean you understand what <br/>\nthat dark and shadowy room looks like to your child; your <br/>\nrecognizing his reality by playing along shows him a way of <br/>\nmastering his fears. How else can a parent confront a pretend <br/>\nmonster, if not by pretending a little? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs your child grows older, the problem with joining in on fictitious <br/>\nfears is that you reinforce the idea that monsters really do exist. <br/>\nWe don&#39;t believe in &quot;chasing the monster away&quot; games once children <br/>\ncan understand the difference between real and pretend. Tell your <br/>\nchild matter-of-factly: &quot;Monsters are only on drawings or TV. They <br/>\naren&#39;t real. And even if they were real, Daddy wouldn&#39;t let them get <br/>\nin our house.&quot; Draw a monster picture and show your three-year-old <br/>\nthe difference between real and imaginary. (&quot;Monsters are pretend. <br/>\nLions are real and Daddy won&#39;t let any lions in here either.&quot;) Since <br/>\nwe share sleep with our children, we haven&#39;t had this monster-in-the-<br/>\nbedroom problem ourselves. Once our kids are secure enough at night <br/>\nto graduate from our bedroom, they are past the age of being tricked <br/>\nby their imagination. Even if your child sleeps in his own room, a <br/>\nlovely part of his bedtime ritual could be Mom or Dad lying down <br/>\nwith him as he falls off to sleep, until he is old enough to enjoy <br/>\ngoing to sleep on his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nTry helping your child imagine a substitute scene: &quot;When you dream <br/>\nabout anything scary, imagine a train at the end of your bed. <br/>\nWhenever you&#39;re afraid you can hop on the train, and mommy and daddy <br/>\nwill be right there in the train with you. You ride around in the <br/>\ntrain for a little while with mommy and daddy, and then the train <br/>\ncomes back and stops at the end of your bed. You get off, and you <br/>\ncrawl back into bed, and by that time you&#39;ll forget the scare.&quot; <br/>\nOffering substitute make-believe works for the sensitive child who <br/>\nfeels threatened at any suggestion that the monsters aren&#39;t real and <br/>\nthat therefore you think he&#39;s dumb for even thinking about monsters. <br/>\nThe best way to get rid of nighttime fears is to prevent them by <br/>\npracticing a style of nighttime parenting that helps the child feel <br/>\nthat sleep is a pleasant state to enter and a fearless state to <br/>\nremain in. <br/>\n<br/>\n7. Get rid of fearful characters. Fear of fantasy characters is one <br/>\nof the most common fears in the preschool child. If your child&#39;s <br/>\nfavorite imaginary characters are not keeping him awake at night, <br/>\nbothering him at school, or making him a generally fearful person, <br/>\njoin in the fun, and let your child enjoy the fantasies while they <br/>\nlast. If they are interfering with your child&#39;s emotional <br/>\ndevelopment, help your child work through what is imaginary and what <br/>\nis real. The child under six has difficulty separating make-believe <br/>\nfrom reality. <br/>\n<br/>\nBanish scary characters from your child&#39;s environment. Turn off <br/>\nscary TV shows and videos. Even better, limit TV and videos for <br/>\npreschoolers to very selective viewing. Beware of films and cartoons <br/>\nthat were created for older children and adults. Help your child <br/>\ndiscern the difference between real and imaginary characters. Talk <br/>\nabout how cartoons and movies are made. Use puppets to put on an <br/>\nact. (&quot;See, these aren&#39;t real; they only talk with your voice or <br/>\nmove if you pull the string.&quot;) <br/>\n<br/>\nBe careful not to transfer your own fears to your child. For <br/>\nexample, your toddler is climbing up on the counter. If you <br/>\nimmediately give him the fear message, &quot;You might fall!&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s <br/>\ndangerous!&quot; he probably will fall. Fear can actually make risk <br/>\nsituations more dangerous. It&#39;s best to calmly walk over to the <br/>\nchild and assist him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Bethryco@a... wrote:<br/>\n&gt; My stepson is 7 and is having a very hard time at night.

This last has improved with both Disney on Ice and<br/>\nher dance recital, which she was able to watch most of this year.

He&#39;s got a lot of <br/>\nfears in general.  And actually, I should say that it&#39;s mostly at night, but <br/>\noften during the day time too.  He gets freaked out and won&#39;t go in his bedroom <br/>\nor the bathroom.  It could be 10am and this still happens.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe are an AP family with our youngest who is pretty high needs - which means <br/>\nhe takes a lot of my time.  He&#39;s my first and we didn&#39;t come to AP or the idea <br/>\nof unschooling (which isn&#39;t an option with stepson for various reasons - <br/>\nbasically not our choice) until DS was born.  So, certainly we did things more <br/>\n&quot;mainstream&quot; and are doing this differently with DS.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m sort of stuck.  I don&#39;t know what to do exactly.  He has trouble during <br/>\nthe day and at night.  We leave a lamp on in his room (his request) and his <br/>\ndoor wide open (his request) to help at night but he still wakes up several times <br/>\na week with nightmares.  He has various little rituals that he does to <br/>\nattempt to make things better for himself, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work (special <br/>\nblankets, pictures of special people, etc.).  I&#39;ve read lots of books on AP but <br/>\nhaven&#39;t found anything about what to do if a child wasn&#39;t raised AP.  Then what? <br/>\n What do you do to back track and help them from where you are?  How can I <br/>\nhelp him get through all the many fears he has.  Night time fears, daytime <br/>\nfears, fears of bugs of all kinds and certain animals and activities.  It becomes <br/>\nso frustrating sometimes because I just don&#39;t know what to do with him and it <br/>\nseems like he&#39;s afraid of everything.  Any ideas?<br/>\n <br/>\nBeth  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2255,"nextTopicId":2267}}
