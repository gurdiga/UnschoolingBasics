Tests tell us what a teacher has failed<br/>\nto communicate.  When a student fails a test, it is not the student<br/>\nwho is at fault.  It is the teacher who has failed.  That teacher has<br/>\nfailed to effectively teach that student in a way in which that<br/>\nstudent needs material presented to him.  I am sad that you would<br/>\nthink I was a teacher.&quot;  I smiled and told him that we at least agreed<br/>\non tests and it was one of the reasons that I homeschool my children.<br/>\nI hope he comes to the cafe again.
