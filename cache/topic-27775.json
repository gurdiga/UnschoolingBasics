As an &quot;assistant&quot;, sure but not as  the<br/>\nprimary caregiver. If the adults in the household are not willing  to<br/>\nhandle the majority of it, it needs a major rethinking. Also, why is  it<br/>\nthat the rabbits &quot;have to&quot; be fed/watered/that the rabbits &quot;have to&quot; be fe<br/>\nin the morning? Would it be less of a struggle if the bunny care  could<br/>\nhappen before lunch (for example)? I&#39;m guessing the rabbits don&#39;t  care -<br/>\nthey&#39;ll adjust to whatever schedule you set  up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****************<br/>\nJust for some information..rabbits eat more at NIGHT then they do  during the <br/>\nday. They tend to nap and be calmer during the light hours and get  more <br/>\nactive and eat more, etc from  late afternoon to night. <br/>\nSo taking that into consideration, that might help you with rabbit  care.<br/>\nOf course fresh water is always a must. and perhaps some hay to nibble on  <br/>\ncould be helpful <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n~marcia<br/>\nHarmonyWoodsFarm <br/>\nmy blog:  _<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony_\">http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony)\">http://www.xanga.com/livefreeinharmony)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27770,"nextTopicId":27783}}
