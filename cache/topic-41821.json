Unschooling is the real world where things and learning happens. I remember when I finished high school. I had no idea what to do, which path to take...All those years of schooling I was told what to do, when to do it and how...And when I was done I felt like I was dropped in the ocean without the proper skills to swim! So now that I think about it, it makes total sense that school doesn&#39;t prepare you for the real world but being part of the real world prepares you to get better at being part of it. <br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I went to college to become a teacher and now that I have my own son I realize that there better ways to live than being part of the school system which is made for a large group but not for any of us in particular. The more observations I did in different schools the more I suffer for all those kids that have no option but to be there...I was one of them and if I had a choice I would prefer to be home schooled or unschooled.<br/>\nAnyway, I never knew or crossed my mind that we had a choice. Never before I heard about unschooling or homeschooling and when I did I thought it was weird but interesting. I am in the process of de-schooling my brain, which is not that easy if one takes in consideration I&#39;ve been schooled since I was 3 years old. And it so pathetic that after 19 years of being schooled I still don&#39;t have the tools/degree to succeed economically. And even if I had the tools I needed, now that I have a son I already got the best degree of all: motherhood and I wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything in the world. Now can you tell me how 19 years of schooling enriched my life? I&#39;d say probably not much.<br/>\nAs one of the group members said unschooling is uncharted territory for me and it makes me feel excited on one hand but worried on the other. I guess we all want to make the best decisions for our children...Maybe one day he can make his own decision about this subject.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Tue, 10/13/09, AnnoraG &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ms_apg@...\">ms_apg@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: AnnoraG &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ms_apg@...\">ms_apg@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Unschooling quesion.<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Tuesday, October 13, 2009, 10:37 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I think that in order to truly understand unschooling, one needs to know what kind of questions to ask.

I went to LIG this passed May to see my friend Ginger Sabo...she and I went to high school together and this was a chance for the two of us to meet up after 20+ years separation, if you will. I was worried that I was going to be around all these kids, LOL....I like kids a lot...but I mostly like my kids :). Anyways...I was concerned....Here I&#39;m going to be at a hotel, for almost 5 days with hundreds of people I don&#39;t know...kids fighting and picking on each other...little kids whining and crying...ugh, I was not prepared for this...but I really wanted to see Ging, so of course I went. Now....I get there, with my preconcieved ideas....prepared for the worst now.... and it never came to fruition. Here are all these kids.... frikkin&#39; amazing kids...taking my kids in, little kids, older kids, with no lines of separation. Everyone played together and just hung out.... no fighting, no bullying, nothing negative. Weird, LOL. What a great week...but surely these kids are just on their best behavior. And then a month or so later, some of the local unschoolers and my boys got together. When Jacinta and Shonna dropped my boys home, all these kids...5 years old to 16 years old, playing in my yard... wth? Really? It&#39;s the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Kids who are unschooled don&#39;t discriminate age groups. And so many other things....I don&#39;t know if this was the appropriate place to post this....but I&#39;m doin&#39; it anyways....I don&#39;t see the journey to learning ever stopping...I learn all the time--constantly! I mean, c&#39;mon, just a few months ago, I was wrong... you can get tons of kids and adults with different age groups and whatnot together and it IS lovely and beautiful and so, so amazing!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah..... pretty cool journey!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Beth<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Beth Williams &lt;beth.s.williams@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Is anybody in this group at the end of the unschooling journey and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can tell me how do your children came out socially and emotionally.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do the appreciate or are happy they were unschooled or they regret<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it...and how many are going to college or are planing to go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t have older kids, [although my soon to be 9 year old just told me she<br/>\n&gt; plans to unschool her children --she says she&#39;s happy with it] so I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; add in that way, and I hope I&#39;m not going totally off topic w/ this, but<br/>\n&gt; lately I&#39;ve been thinking about how interesting it is that people don&#39;t ask<br/>\n&gt; these questions about &quot;schooled&quot; kids.

I don&#39;t expect them to &quot;turn out&quot;. All my  <br/>\nchildren are as social as they want to be. They are all articulate and  <br/>\ncapable of engaging with other humans individually or with groups.  <br/>\nThey are around people of all ages, races, economic statuses, sexual  <br/>\norientation.etc. Life is diverse. They are not socislized in a way  <br/>\nthat most school kids are, homogeized peer culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my kids are freely living their life right now. They don&#39;t have  <br/>\nto wait until after high school or college to live their own life.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing. My dd12 is a writer. It&#39;s not something she hopes to  <br/>\nbecome.

We are innundated with  <br/>\nsocial opportunities. They will leave the condo and seek people out or  <br/>\nwill ask to stay in if they need space.

He&#39;s sooooooo much happier now then he ever was in school. He&#39;s done a lot of healing in the past few years, gone from hating pretty much everything to being really enthusiastic about life and learning. He has no regrets about unschooling, has more and better friends than he ever did in school and is starting to actively move forward on some possible career paths. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay doesn&#39;t plan to go to college at this point, but that could change. He knows there&#39;s not rule that says college starts at 18 or never. If he wants/needs a few college classes or a degree, that door is open in his mind. It wasn&#39;t when he was in school. The last conversation we had with the principle we were told Ray was on &quot;the prison track&quot;. If nothing else, we have succeeded where school failed miserably in that regard. Ray&#39;s probalby the most stable, responsible 16yo male in the county. <br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently Ray&#39;s studying decorative and functional metalwork (including jewelry making) and woodwork. He&#39;s found local professional craftspeople to take classes with and/or apprentice with. Classes we either pay for or work out a work-exchange with the craftsperson. Locally there is the Appalachian Center for Crafts that offers some classes. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say its likely Ray might find himself doing that at some point. Of course, knowing the school, there&#39;s also a chance he could end up teaching there at some point, whether or not he ever takes a class there. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - How do you make sure that your children are getting enough socialization with the same and opposite sex?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that &quot;homeschool&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re stuck at home! My kids get more chances to actually socialize, to connect with people with similar interests, than they would if they were in school - and that&#39;s with us living in the middle of nowhere and not getting out as much as we&#39;d always like. Ray has mostly adult social connections, but through them he has met a number of people in their teens and twenties with whom he has a lot in common. In school he had one thing in common with his &quot;friends&quot; and that was hating school and feeling like an outcast. Now he has friends who share his interests, passions, questions about life, concerns about the world. His friends are people who, like him, aren&#39;t stuck in a school building all day. Most of them, like him, don&#39;t have to &quot;answer&quot; to anyone out of anything other than friendly courtesy. Some of his friends are female, some are male. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; - How do you deal with family or people that raise an eyebrow when you tell them you are homeschooling your children.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m very good at exuding confidence in my decisions. Its something to practice if you&#39;re not. I say &quot;we homeschool&quot; matter-of-factly, and when people ask questions I speak glowingly of my kids. Its not hard, I adore them and love to talk about them! So I channel all of that into telling stories of kids doing fun things, learning independently, since that seems to help people understand, learning things that school kids typically don&#39;t, since that helps too. Talking about pulling down the microscope on a whim if someone cuts a finger helps non-homeschoolers get the idea of what learning out of the box can look like. Talking about reading together in a hammock, or figuring sales and taxes at the store together helps, too. My goal is not to either be on the defensive or put anyone else there, either, but to open a little peep-hole into the wonderful life my kids are living. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301676677,"authorName":"Monica Van Stelton","from":"Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt;","profile":"tatyland_usa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling quesion.","postDate":"1255276193","msgId":41825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg5Mjk1OC40MTY5MC5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwMS5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQzE4OEQ3QjM2NDkxRC00MUYwLTNFRTBAd2VibWFpbC1tMDkxLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":41823,"nextInTopic":41826,"prevInTime":41824,"nextInTime":41826,"topicId":41821,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you Kelly!

I guess that school is to blame a bit because, and it happened to me, when you ask a question or say anything other children may say that you are asking stupid questions just because they are not smart enough to understand the question or just playing mean. That kind of attitudes make you stop wanting to ask questions or fear public speaking I think. <br/>\nAnyway, thank you again for sharing your time with me.<br/>\nMonica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Sun, 10/11/09, Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Kelly Lovejoy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Unschooling quesion.<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Sunday, October 11, 2009, 6:25 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n                  <br/>\n<br/>\n I have two boys, 21 and 13.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Cameron, the 21 year old, is quite emotionally and socially stable.
