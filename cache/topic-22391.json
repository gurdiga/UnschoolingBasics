It doesn&#39;t need to look anything at<br/>\nall like &quot;preschool&quot; or whatever. Spend an afternoon messing about in<br/>\nthe mud out in the backyard then have a blast in a nice warm bubble<br/>\nbath. Kids are good at playing, grown ups tend to loose it. So, start<br/>\nlearning play all over again from your kids. Have fun. Relax. Live,<br/>\nlove, laugh together, the learning will happen, formal didactic type<br/>\nstuff need never happen (unless one of the kids happens to be fascinated<br/>\nby textbooks)<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
