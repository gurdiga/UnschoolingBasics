Very very  <br/>\nsmall kitchens - not really fully equipped. They have lots of  <br/>\ncommunal space - a SUPER kitchen that is equipped with the most  <br/>\nawesome appliances and cooking gear. A very large dining area that  <br/>\ncan be used for meetings and activities. It also has several rooms  <br/>\noff of it that can be used for various kinds of meetings/activities.  <br/>\nAnybody who lives there can use any of this - just need to sign up.  <br/>\nKitchen duty is mandatory - a certain amount per week. Some people  <br/>\ncook, some serve, some clean up. I can&#39;t remember if they prepare  <br/>\nthree meals a day or just one there - for everyone to share. You sign  <br/>\nup for the meals that you&#39;re going to be present for, too. I don&#39;t  <br/>\nremember the details of how it works, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe homes all open to a large park-like area - large enough and with  <br/>\nenough bushes and trees that you don&#39;t see the homes across from you,  <br/>\nbut they are actually pretty close - about as close as across the  <br/>\nstreet would normally be. There are pathways that lead all through  <br/>\nthe park area to all the houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is just a bit more sharing than I think I&#39;d be comfortable with  <br/>\n- but the people who choose this are comfortable with it. They share  <br/>\ncars and bikes and stuff, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in a university town and the people who live there tend to be  <br/>\nprofessionals - attorneys, professors.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":8667530,"authorName":"Manisha Kher","from":"Manisha Kher &lt;m_kher@...&gt;","profile":"m_kher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] community living","postDate":"1138227313","msgId":9655,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTI1MjIxNTEzLjIyNTgzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU0NDEyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJBMkU0OTdGLTRBODAtNDA2NC04RkY0LUFGOTNBMTY2Q0U4QkBkaWVyYXVlci5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":9650,"nextInTopic":9659,"prevInTime":9654,"nextInTime":9656,"topicId":9611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I d like to live in a community.

Each family could choose how much or<br/>\nhow little involvement there would be. I figure that I&#39;m perfectly<br/>\nwilling to garden whether anyone helps or not, and I&#39;m perfectly<br/>\nwilling to share my garden. Maybe someone else will have chickens and<br/>\nbe willing to share their eggs with me, or honey or??<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be voluntary, so without all the expectations, there&#39;s little<br/>\nroom for disappointment. Maybe one family really wants to keep to<br/>\nthemselves more and NOT get involved. Without any requirements or<br/>\nexpectations, that would be acceptable.

The other family had their  <br/>\ncurriculum, and another family wanted to do their school work alone  <br/>\nand meet for field trips.

Once bitten, twice shy, I guess... Though in my case, it&#39;s more  <br/>\nlike Quadruply bitten, Quintuply shy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to agree with you that such a community is more likely to be  <br/>\nsuccessful if someone starts it saying, &quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing here.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome to join if you are willing to join this project,&quot;  <br/>\nrather than an amorphous group getting together and then trying to  <br/>\ndecide what the community norms are. Heck, I do this in small ways-- <br/>\nyears ago, I stopped saying, &quot;Do you want to have dinner together?  <br/>\nWhat should we get?&quot; because the endless discussions that followed  <br/>\nwore me out. I started saying, &quot;I&#39;m going for Chinese. Want to come?&quot;  <br/>\nIt works much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I look at something like the shared garden and  <br/>\nshared spaces, and think, &quot;And what happens when one family stops  <br/>\nmeeting their obligation to keep the garden up?&quot; Every time I&#39;ve  <br/>\nlived in community, long or short term, there was somebody who  <br/>\ninitially agreed to the community&#39;s expectations and then failed to  <br/>\nfollow through. We ended up with communal bathrooms that hadn&#39;t been  <br/>\ncleaned in six months, or a dinner that was supposed to be on the  <br/>\ntable and wasn&#39;t because that day&#39;s cook went to a movie instead. Or  <br/>\na community member who had stopped paying rent, and we didn&#39;t have  <br/>\nthe spine as a community to kick him out because we knew he couldn&#39;t  <br/>\npay the rent anyplace else, either, so we ended up subsidizing him  <br/>\nfor the better part of a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once lived in a community that had agreed to use only fragrance- <br/>\nfree personal grooming products and cleaning products. When some  <br/>\nmembers violated this agreement (choosing &quot;unscented&quot; products that  <br/>\ncontained fragrance), and I started getting sick from it, none of the  <br/>\nother group members were willing to support me in enforcing the norm.  <br/>\n&quot;It doesn&#39;t smell that strong,&quot; they said, because to them it didn&#39;t.  <br/>\n&quot;If people are choosing products that say unscented, we can&#39;t expect  <br/>\nmore than that.&quot; We had made an agreement (not initiated by me; I  <br/>\njoined this community in part because it already had a commitment to  <br/>\navoiding things that could trigger allergies and environmental  <br/>\nsensitivities) but it turned out people had different ideas of what  <br/>\nit meant. Most community members thought it meant &quot;we&#39;ll do this  <br/>\nwithin the bounds of what is available in the mainstream  <br/>\nmarketplace.&quot; I thought it meant, &quot;we&#39;ll do this in a way that will  <br/>\nkeep people well.&quot; They were willing to support the ideal in the  <br/>\nabstract, but in practice they weren&#39;t willing to give up a favorite  <br/>\nhand lotion even if the price of them using that lotion was  <br/>\ndebilitating headaches for me. Fortunately it was a short-term living  <br/>\nsituation and easy to exit, but leaving was ultimately my only option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not meaning to run down a catalog of personal ills--it&#39;s just  <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve done this experiment a lot of times in a lot of places, in  <br/>\ngroups as small as 6 and as large as 500--and this stuff always comes  <br/>\nup. The trouble isn&#39;t worth it to me anymore. But I know people for  <br/>\nwhom the trouble IS worth it--I know a group of young single moms who  <br/>\nare living together in a great big old house right now, and it&#39;s  <br/>\nworking really well for them and their kids. And it&#39;s a place to go  <br/>\nfor women who find themselves unexpectedly single with young kids, as  <br/>\nrecently happened to a woman I know--the rent is reasonable, there&#39;s  <br/>\npractical support. Much better than having to get an apartment and  <br/>\nlive in isolation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reached my own personal tolerance limit long ago.
