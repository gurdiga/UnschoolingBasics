We walk along  <br/>\nbeside them being there when they need us there and backing off when  <br/>\nthey need us to back off. Some kids need more backing off to figure  <br/>\nit out for themselves, which would look like antiauthoritarian  <br/>\nparenting. But some kids need more help or like being with someone as  <br/>\nthey explore to talk about it and antiauthoritarian wouldn&#39;t meet  <br/>\ntheir needs at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most parenting theories would claim to meet kids&#39; needs. But  <br/>\nwith most the parents feel they know what&#39;s best and decide what the  <br/>\nkids&#39; needs are. Unschoolers treat each child as an individual and  <br/>\ntrust children&#39;s feelings about themselves. If they act as if they  <br/>\nwant more of our time we need to trust their actions rather than  <br/>\nreferring to some authority to tell us how much of our time our kids  <br/>\nshould need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s something missing from that explanation, though, because it  <br/>\ncauses parents to think we mean stay up until 2AM with a 3 yo because  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t lay down to sleep earlier and I&#39;m not quite sure how to  <br/>\nget that concept in neatly without tacking it on like this. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] difference between unschooling and antiauthoritarian approach","postDate":"1160402997","msgId":18014,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMDkwNzA5ajJkNjI1MDZhbDVjY2JmM2E5NzljODBiMTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJDMEZDQjBGLThDODYtNDY4MS1CNDU4LTJFNjFCNDAxNkY0N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDJDMEZDQjBGLThDODYtNDY4MS1CNDU4LTJFNjFCNDAxNkY0N0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18008,"nextInTopic":18046,"prevInTime":18013,"nextInTime":18015,"topicId":18008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
