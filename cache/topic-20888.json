But sometimes, this week in special, she gets <br/>\nangry for something and kicks, punches me. earlier she would cry and <br/>\nexpress in words that she is upset. but now she started to scream at <br/>\nthe top of the voice and kick me, roll me down. I know she is trying <br/>\ndifferent ways of letting out her anger - but sometimes i lose being <br/>\ncalm and slowly talk in a very firm voice. So it is mostly my voice <br/>\nthat makes a difference - which I dont want to happen - i try to <br/>\nexplain aftermath that her being so hard in expressing her feelings <br/>\neven though I am trying to understand her point, but slowly I too get <br/>\nangry as I am physically challenged.
