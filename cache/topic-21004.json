The odds of your new microwave catching on fire should be real<br/>\nlow (first time I&#39;ve heard of something like this happening). That<br/>\nsaid, if you&#39;re happier buying another brand/type microwave, go ahead,<br/>\nthey&#39;re not *that* expensive. Or just quit using microwaves, most stuff<br/>\ncan be warmed up just about as quickly in a pan. Basically, do whatever<br/>\nmakes you feel comfortable. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and install a smoke detector for peace of mind while you&#39;re asleep.<br/>\nAnd tell your kids what to do if a fire were to occur (e.g., if<br/>\npossible, wake everyone else up, call 911, leave the house).<br/>\n<br/>\nMarieke<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nWant to start your own business?<br/>\nLearn how on Yahoo!
