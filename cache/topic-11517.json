Software of all kinds about <br/>\nstuff they were interested in and it often included math.  When they <br/>\nwere working on something they would ask me questions, sometimes about <br/>\nmath, and need to know how to do it to get to the next level. So at <br/>\nthat moment, I would show them how to do it, in the easiest shortest <br/>\nmanner possible.<br/>\nReal life did most of the teaching, for instance, we have a back yard <br/>\npool, so when I was deciding how much chemical to put in for the number <br/>\nof gallons of water I would talk all this outloud to them.  It&#39;s really <br/>\ngreat because they can now &#39;pool sit&#39; when hubby and I leave town.:0)  <br/>\nOne other thing my gilrs enjoyed, and I don&#39;t even know if they are <br/>\nstill being published, but Highlights magazine put out these little <br/>\nbooks called math mania, they had fun with those on car trips.  I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t use them like workbooks or anything though, they were free to <br/>\npage through them and do what looked fun.  Another thing is hubby <br/>\nshowed them lots of cool calculator tricks, like how they will add <br/>\nfractions or automatically compute square root with the press of a <br/>\nbutton. Plus playing with fun patterns, I really don&#39;t know what all, <br/>\nit was something fun they did with Dad.  I think they even had a little <br/>\nbook that was called &#39;fun with the calculator&#39; or somehting like that.  <br/>\nThey both said that knowing their way around a calculator was very <br/>\nvaluable for learning to conquer the ACT.  They were able to see a lot <br/>\nof shortcuts that saved them time.<br/>\nReally though, don&#39;t worry, even if they learn none of that it is still <br/>\nok, when they want or need to know math they will then learn it easily <br/>\nand joyfully and for a purpose.  If they BOMB the math on the ACt, it <br/>\nis still OK, community college will admit them and place them in the <br/>\nappropriate math class.  I know this for sure because one of my <br/>\ndaughters&#39; unschooling friends started in a basic math class for this <br/>\nreason, she aced the class, and went on....guess what...this time next <br/>\nyear she&#39;ll be a nurse.  See??  She learned all the math she needed.  <br/>\nEnded up taking two extra classes and those counted towards electives <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa McMahon-Lowe","from":"&quot;Lesa McMahon-Lowe&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] math and going to college","postDate":"1144710923","msgId":11521,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExNS1EQVY3NEM5QjE0NEFCNjRBRDM5OThFMzBEM0NDMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUxZWM1NCs1MjkxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11517,"nextInTopic":11527,"prevInTime":11520,"nextInTime":11522,"topicId":11517,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"thank you for sharing that, Ann.  these stories help to keep me sane.  :) ~*~*~ Lesa M.

She was at home until 8th, to a public high school<br/>\nfor 2 1/2 years decided she hated the environment and went to<br/>\ncommunity college.<br/>\n   <br/>\nMy next oldest is a 14 yo boy He was at home through 4th, ps for 5th,<br/>\nhome for 6th. He wanted to try a choice school for the next year.<br/>\nThat&#39;s where he&#39;s been, but now he realizes some things about people,<br/>\nschool, control issues, and has decided to come home after this<br/>\nsemester ends.  <br/>\nMy youngest(dd) was at home until 2nd, and then was in ps for 2nd &<br/>\n3rd & home the past 2 years.  None of them have any desire to ever<br/>\nreturn to ps. Part of me is distressed they experience ps, but another<br/>\npart is glad they know what it *really* is and that they made an<br/>\ninformed choice.  Anyway, hope to read more great inspirations!<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nKaty <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m trying to remember when we started becoming interested in<br/>\nunschooling.
