A few people asked in the home-<br/>\nschooling boards we subscribe to, if we can do this activity again.. <br/>\nYES, WE CAN!!! After making a few calls, this is what we have to <br/>\noffer for all homeschoolers / unschoolers. This is not part of any <br/>\ngroup. We are just going to have clean safe fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nFriday,  March 6th 1-3pm @ Renton Skatebarn $5 per kid. The famous <br/>\nMitchie Brusco (utube him and you will be either amazed or clench <br/>\nyour teeth with fear!) will be there to skate with us!
