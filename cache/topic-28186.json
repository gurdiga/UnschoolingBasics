It is actually her boyfriend&#39;s house, but they&#39;ve been together<br/>\nfor about 4 years. <br/>\nMy mom was decorating for Christmas; putting lights on the tree, and<br/>\nhad lots of boxes of decorations out. My daughter(2)was fascinated by<br/>\nso many things she saw- 2&#39;tall moving Christmas figures, a stuffed<br/>\nsnowman, etc., and wanted to play with everything.<br/>\nMy son(11) asked my mom if he could play games on her laptop computer,<br/>\nand she said ok.<br/>\nMy daughter was mostly staying out of the boxes, after she found the<br/>\nstuffed snowman that mostly kept her busy, and she was also watching<br/>\nmy mom string the lights.<br/>\nAt some point, I went into the kitchen and heated up some food for me<br/>\n& the kids. They both came in and ate, and then went back into the<br/>\nliving room by mom mom. I called my husband and talked for just a<br/>\nlittle while, when I heard my mom say my name, so I said, &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br/>\nI didn&#39;t hear anything, and it was only about 30 seconds later that my<br/>\nmom came storming in with my daughter in her arms and said, &quot;When I<br/>\ncall your name, I expect you to come and see what I&#39;m trying to tell<br/>\nyou. I shouldn&#39;t have to say it more than once!&quot;<br/>\nShe was upset because my daughter crawled under the tree as they were<br/>\nlifting it up to put something under it, and I didn&#39;t immediately come<br/>\nto the rescue. My son was sitting right next to the tree, using the<br/>\nlaptop. He would have gladly helped out & got his sister out of there,<br/>\nhad they asked him to.<br/>\nWell, this caused such a huge upset that I just had to get out of<br/>\nthere! I was so mad that my mom talked to me that way, as if I was<br/>\nbeing a bad parent and not watching my kids every moment, when there<br/>\nwere 3 other people in the room with my daughter!<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t help but to cry(darned pregnancy hormones!)as I got our<br/>\nthings together. I was trying not to look at my mom so she wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nsee me.<br/>\nAfter that, while I was getting our things together to leave, I heard<br/>\nmy mom raise her voice at my son, telling him to close the laptop, and<br/>\ntelling him it was time to go, because, &quot;your mom&#39;s crying, and it&#39;s<br/>\nall my fault, once again!&quot;<br/>\nHe came into the kitchen by me with his head down.<br/>\nThis is not entirely a typical visit to my mom&#39;s.<br/>\nPerhaps she was having a bad day to begin with, but she took it all<br/>\nout on me & my kids.<br/>\nThere were other times during the visit when she&#39;d tell me I needed to<br/>\nmake sure my daughter didn&#39;t get into the boxes.. or that she was<br/>\ngetting too close to the tree as the lights were being strung.. <br/>\nSometimes it gets a bit exasperating, as if my job as a parent is made<br/>\ndifficult only by getting together with my mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an unschooling moment mixed in, though... earlier in the<br/>\nday, my son watched a library video about volcanoes, and at my mom&#39;s<br/>\nhouse, he told me about how certain animals behave before an<br/>\nearthquake, or before a volcano erupts, and about how animals have<br/>\nmore senses than humans. This was hours after he watched the video,<br/>\nand I was so happy that he picked up some new information.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28177,"nextTopicId":28157}}
