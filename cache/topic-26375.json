We meet at playground<br/>\nand picnic tables behind the Bear Mtn Inn (near row boats).  Discussion<br/>\ngroup starts promptly at 12:00 pm noon.  Stay for afternoon play and<br/>\ncontinued informal discussions - all unschoolers welcome. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that those of us who regularly attend with older kids are radical<br/>\nunschoolers definitely sets a tone.  We do host a formal discussion for the<br/>\nfirst hour and half where if ever the topic of limits, (food, tv, video<br/>\ngames, bed times), forced curriculum, chores etc are on the table newbies<br/>\nget the full flavor of a real unschooled life rather quickly.  And more<br/>\noften than not those that are early in their unschooling journey become<br/>\nenlightened and stick around.  When we started we clearly defined the needs<br/>\nof the group as a support group and not an educational venue for folks not<br/>\nsure, exploring or simply curious.  We plan to host some kind of<br/>\nintroduction event to unschoolers for those that are on the fence or<br/>\ncurious.  But the group&#39;s integrity as one that supports each other in our<br/>\nunschooling path is important to the founders and we&#39;ve managed to maintain<br/>\nthat flavor.  There are folks in the area who choose not to come because we<br/>\ndon&#39;t fit their idea of an unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a yahoo group for this meeting.  The only way to join this is<br/>\nby invitation only and by FIRST attending the physical irl meeting.   While<br/>\nit does promote a certain amount of exclusivity it also has really allowed<br/>\nfor local young unschooling families to follow the path without hearing what<br/>\nthey can already hear on regular homeschooling lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 3 and half years, we&#39;ve got over 40 families participating and<br/>\ncontinue to grow each month.  At any one time a meeting can be as few as 3<br/>\nto 5 families and we&#39;ve been as many as 15  - 20 families attending.  It&#39;s a<br/>\npretty dynamic group.  But it takes the commitment of just a few of us to<br/>\nkeep it going.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn New York there was an unschooling state wide yahoo group (Families<br/>\nUnschooling In New York - FUNNY) that was started and then there quickly<br/>\nbecame a need to start a second unschooling state wide group - the second<br/>\none is called Radical Unschooling in New York (Runny).  Today RUNNY is the<br/>\nmore active list of the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would say - start you own group and call it RADICAL unschooling.   If<br/>\nyou build it they will come. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Heyman<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":198023026,"authorName":"caradove","from":"&quot;caradove&quot; &lt;caradove@...&gt;","profile":"caradove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do you know when an unschooler is an UNschooler?","postDate":"1190258721","msgId":26407,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZjc3A3MStiZDY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZjc2dnYis2Z2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26403,"nextInTopic":26412,"prevInTime":26406,"nextInTime":26410,"topicId":26375,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Ren!
