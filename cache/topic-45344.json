After the success of the first ever Australian Unschooling Conference earlier this year, the second Australian Conference is to go ahead for 2011.  Check out the web site for details; pass on to all who may be interested.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschoolingretreat.com/\">http://www.unschoolingretreat.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are a lot of Australian unschoolers on this list!  On a more personal note, if you actively unschool, or are keen to pursue such a way of life, drop me a line!  We live in SE Melbourne.  I have three kiddies, Mia (8) Jude(5) and Rueben (2).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to cross post, so I apologise if you read this more than once . . . <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45195,"nextTopicId":45308}}
