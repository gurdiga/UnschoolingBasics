Your goal is to<br/>\nhelp them learn to recognize when they&#39;re tired so they&#39;ll decide to sleep<br/>\nby their bodies. So when you notice signs of tiredness (which might be<br/>\ngetting wound up!) start winding down and doing relaxing bed ritual things.<br/>\nBath. Reading. Music in their room. TV in their room.
