Does he not care if something bothers the people in<br/>\nhis family? Or is it a moment of anger thing? I can see why stomping<br/>\naround feels good and how easy it would be to not care about the<br/>\nsleeping brother at that age, but I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;d keep pushing<br/>\nthe toy when you asked him to stop.
