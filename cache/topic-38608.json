Harry Turtledove is a wonderful writer. Now Gone with the Wind, I need a new copy my original one has well, faced its final reading (the one I read in 4th grade). The movie was well done in its own right but definitely no comparison to the book. Though I can understand why they cut so much out the movie still ended up 3 hours long. Now if some one out there were to turn it into a mini-series, I would love to see it. Unfortunately Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh will not be able to be in it. I think that both actors did a magnificent job with the characters. Ok I could watch Clark Gable play almost any kind of role and still be in love with him.Another book that I felt didn&#39;t translate well into a movie was Fried Green Tomatoes. Granted I need to go back and read the book again it has been so long and then watch the movie over to remember exactly why I feel<br/>\n that way. It has been so long. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nWhere the Red Fern Grows, I still cry at the end. I cried at the end of the most recently released movie as well, so did my daughter. Now the latest LOTR and Harry Potter movies have all done an excellent job of translating from written to screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: diana jenner &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:hahamommy@...\">hahamommy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, February 28, 2009 12:42:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] graphic novels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Not all books were created equal, some are better than others, but that is<br/>\n&gt; completely subjective to the person reading it. A friend of mine loves<br/>\n&gt; Steinbeck, personally I could live without his novels. Though I do see the<br/>\n&gt; underlying messages he tries to pass on to his readers. On the other hand<br/>\n&gt; the Bobbsey Twins by Lilain Garis hold a special place in my heart. As do so<br/>\n&gt; many others. My teacher in 4th grade was flabbergasted when I chose to read<br/>\n&gt; Gone with the Wind as my civil war era novel for my book report. She had<br/>\n&gt; been brought up to think of it as smut. I was so proud of my mom standing<br/>\n&gt; there telling her that it was on the list of classics for historical novels.<br/>\n&gt; Granted my grandmother had a similar attitude as my 4th grade teacher but<br/>\n&gt; they were of the same generation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I remember reading Catcher in the Rye -- not because I was in any way<br/>\ninterested, simply because there was library scuttle-butt surrounding it&#39;s<br/>\nexistence :)  Not being an angst-filled person at the point, certainly not<br/>\nto the level of the main character, I found the book to be a silly vehicle<br/>\nfor the f-bomb!<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed the course where To Kill a Mockingbird was required, lucky me!  I<br/>\npicked it up as a 20 year old, working in the school district -- WOW! What a<br/>\npowerful book!  Now, at 40, I just listened to it for the first time (read<br/>\nby a wonderful southern belle voice) and so many things pop out at me,<br/>\ndifferent things than when I read it first 20 years ago (Scout and Jem were<br/>\nthe first generation to go to school, Scout&#39;s teachers upsetedness over<br/>\nScout&#39;s knowledge before school, etc).<br/>\nI received Gone with the Wind for my 25th birthday (same year the 25th<br/>\nedition was published) from a friend who was delighted I&#39;d never read it!<br/>\nWe had a movie party after I finished reading it... I had never been so<br/>\ndisappointed with a novel&#39;s adaptation! Beautiful movie, not nearly as<br/>\namazing as the book.  Which led to an interest in Harry Turtledove&#39;s<br/>\nalternate histories, when offered &quot;Guns of the South&quot; a few years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nDidn&#39;t read Where the Red Fern Grows until I was 24, Mitch gave me a copy on<br/>\nour first date -- it was love &lt;3 Now, I&#39;ve offered it to Hayden, not only an<br/>\namazing book with a great story I know he&#39;ll enjoy, also a historical part<br/>\nof his parents&#39; relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally if a child picks up a book to read and it holds their interest,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; let them. What is the old saying, &quot;A picture is worth 1000 words&quot;? Think<br/>\n&gt; about how often a piece of art work has inspired you, the feelings it has<br/>\n&gt; brought to the surface. How is that any different than reading a graphic<br/>\n&gt; novel. Words are wonderful, I live in my own world that I have created with<br/>\n&gt; words and art. The two mediums of creativity go beautifully together, but<br/>\n&gt; they also can stand very well on their own.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My opinion on writings is: if someone took the time to write it, it&#39;s<br/>\nprobably worth reading for *someone* -- sometimes that someone is me,<br/>\nsometimes it&#39;s someone I can refer, sometimes it&#39;s someone I can only<br/>\nimagine existing ;)<br/>\nI love that unschooling truly uncovers the hidden roads to joy that school<br/>\nhas spent decades paving over ;)<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski. blogspot. com<br/>\nhannahsashes. blogspot. com<br/>\ndianas365.blogspot. com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38593,"nextTopicId":38609}}
