I thought because she was becoming interested in learning <br/>\nshe was through the stage of deschooling.  I guess I need to be a bit <br/>\nmore patient with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked a little more about it yesterday.  I pointed out to her that <br/>\nshe is learning all the time.  I asked her if she was comparing <br/>\nherself to her homeschooled and schooled friends and she <br/>\nreplied &quot;maybe&quot;.  I explained that they are learning things just to <br/>\npass a test and then they will probably forget it and move on the next <br/>\ntest.  She seemed to be ok with that explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has periods where I do see some changes going on.  We are playing <br/>\nmore games together, last night she beat me at chess again, we baked <br/>\ncookies together in the afternoon, stuff like that.  Before our change <br/>\nin lifestyle of rad-unschooling, she rarely wanted to do stuff with <br/>\nme.  We weren&#39;t close, I was a controlling and demanding type of mom <br/>\nwith lots of stupid rules.  Now that I have changed, she likes being <br/>\naround me, she evens tells me that I&#39;m cool now.
