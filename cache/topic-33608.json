My in-laws are visiting this weekend. FIL had not seen the new baby yet so they came out to see him. Got in Friday morning and will leave most likely before we get up Monday morning. So it is not a long visit so I know the best thing is to just grin and bear it and just let things go. Nothing to bad yet but it is giving me a glimps into the future when the boys are &quot;school&quot; age. Right now they are just 4, 2, and 4 months.<br/>\n&nbsp;<br/>\nThere have been comments here and there like &quot;How is Eric (the oldest) doing on his ABC&#39;s?&quot; to which I reply with &quot;He is doing just fine.&quot; Answering her but not all at the same time. :) Telling me how I should put them in school the first few years at least to &quot;give me a break.&quot; Ummmm thanks but my weekly yard sales I hit every Saturday are good enough for me and my down time. I do not need to send my kids away for 40+hrs a week. Call me crazy but I LIKE my kids......<br/>\n&nbsp;<br/>\nMy 2 yo is prone to fits sometimes. He has a temper and it comes from my in-laws side. My MIL has it. She knows it and she was even talking to him the other day about it is hard to have a temper and she knows because she has it and it is hard to control sometimes and blah blah. She is over 50 yrs on him and she has a hard time controlling it sometimes what do you expect from a 2 yo? So at lunch he wanted to get his own food and they had stopped him. I was putting the baby for a nap and when I heard him crying I came to find out why. While trying to ask WHAT he was doing when the fit started to figure out WHY he was having one she kept saying that she could not eat like this and he needed to be sent to his room to &quot;fix it&quot; and I was just showing him that it was ok ect ect. So I of course stood up for him and said &quot;if someone will just tell me what he was doing when he got upset then I can help him!&quot; finally got out that he was trying to get into the food<br/>\n so I said &quot;and the problem with that is what he just wants to be a big boy and get his own lunch&quot; So I helped him realize he could and BAM he was happy in a second. <br/>\n&nbsp;<br/>\nI am just trying to let it all go because I hate to get into it when I know it can be avoided. I am of course watching out for MY KIDS and THEIR interests first and foremost. I just needed somewhere to vent. No need to reply I just needed to get it out to people who get it and know what I am going through.

Is your daughter OK to be home when you are not there?  I find with my girls (13 1/2), once they were set free to find their own rhythms, they sleep until at least 11, and sometimes even 1 or 2 (they both went through a period of staying up all night and sleeping all day, but they eventually got over that). I share my house with another mom whose kids also don&#39;t go to school, and they are 13 1/2 year old twin boys - weird coincidence, I know - but it gives us a lot of data - her boys also went through the all-night thing, but one of them decided he preferred to be awake during the day, and switched himself around, and the other one is the only one who still totally stays up all night and sleeps most of the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my point is, that once you set her free, you may find that a different pattern will develop anyway, and you don&#39;t yet know what that&#39;s going to be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs your daughter&#39;s goal to finish high school?  Where do you live (e.g. in which state, if in the US) - if she is very motivated to finish high school, there are innumerable on-line accredited high-school diploma courses - just google it!   You might want to read a book or two by Grace Llewellyn for some more things to think about concerning High School and if it is really necessary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are short cuts to college/university that she may want to explore, if that is more her true goal  - high school isn&#39;t actually necessary for many college/university programs.  Another resource you might want to look at is Life Learning Magazine (www.lifelearningmagazine.com) which is choc-a-bloc with alternative educational resource ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Athabasca University (www.athabascau.ca) , which is physically located in Alberta, Canada, offers on-line college credit courses to anyone who is 16 - no high school diploma required - there may be some prerequisites if it&#39;s like advanced math or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there&#39;s lots of possibilities, and so many find it is such a relief to get off the high school treadmill and set your learning free!  Lots of luck to you!  I&#39;m not sure how you could do the others - you might have to hire a babysitter when you weren&#39;t home if the oldest ones aren&#39;t able/willing to look after the younger ones?  But, one step at a time, eh?
