But the list is SO long!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We also try to purchase things our<br/>\n&gt;kids want all year, but there are still items we get at Christmas.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My kids all have birthdays close to Christmas, so I like giving them bigger <br/>\ngifts that they have to wait on then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Something we&#39;ve done with extended family is a name drawing. That way<br/>\n&gt;you can focus on purchasing one nicer gift for the person you draw,<br/>\n&gt;rather than something smaller for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s between my sisters and I. Last year we drew a family name and the<br/>\n&gt;idea was a gift the whole family could enjoy (games, food etc..). I<br/>\n&gt;really like to just have the cousins draw a name and do it that way,<br/>\n&gt;it changes every year.:)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I do some name drawing between all the divorces and remarriages, we have <br/>\nlots of &quot;Christmas&quot; gathering near Christmas. It&#39;s difficult because I am <br/>\none of 11 kids, 19 nieces and nephews.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I am just going to have to change my attitude to some degree. I&#39;m <br/>\ndown right pissy about it right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet a FREE small business Web site and more from Microsoftï¿½ Office Live! <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/aub0930003811mrt/direct/01/\">http://clk.atdmt.com/MRT/go/aub0930003811mrt/direct/01/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26172,"nextTopicId":26177}}
