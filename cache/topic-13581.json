It&#39;s because<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been examining that practice in a new light and they don&#39;t<br/>\nlike the new vision. The new vision makes them more uncomfortable<br/>\nthan the fear. One of their balloons doesn&#39;t look so comforting any<br/>\nmore. They were only seeing the balloon part of the practice that was<br/>\nholding them up and supporting their fears, but now they&#39;ve seen the<br/>\nlead part that was weighing down their kids and holding themselves<br/>\nback. They&#39;ve reached the point with that practice where they&#39;ve<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s scary to let go, but I can now see that where this<br/>\nballoon is taking me is even scarier. And I want help letting go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that everyone has let go of all their balloons!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that letting go is easy! You just haven&#39;t seen all the<br/>\nself-examination that has gone on in private as people read the list<br/>\nwithout posting. This is the list to post to when you&#39;ve decided to<br/>\nlet go.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s also a good list to read to help you get to the point where<br/>\nyou want to let go of a practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just isn&#39;t a good place to tell people why you aren&#39;t ready to let<br/>\ngo ;-) Because everyone who posts regularly has let go of at least<br/>\none balloon and is eager to help others let go of the ones they now<br/>\nsee were weighing them down.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; At<br/>\n&gt; this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you&#39;re ready to work on that, it will help yourself *hugely* to<br/>\nsee that you are *choosing* not to let him. You don&#39;t like the<br/>\nconsequences (they *are* temporary consequences!) of letting him have<br/>\nall the screen time he&#39;d like. So you are *choosing* to limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is one piece of advice I could give people it would be to<br/>\nsee everything they do as a choice. It is so incredibly freeing :-)<br/>\nIt seems like the only reason we do so many unpleasant things in life<br/>\nis because we don&#39;t have a choice. But it&#39;s the perception of not<br/>\nhaving a choice makes them doubly onerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, I hated cleaning the toilet. It was just something you<br/>\nhad to do every week (or month ;-) And just because I had to do it, I<br/>\nnever wanted to and fought against it, often avoiding my<br/>\nresponsibility for 6 months! But when I realized it was a choice,<br/>\nthat I could choose to never ever ever scrub the toilet again, I<br/>\nrealized that it was nice to see it not filthy. I could choose --<br/>\nwhen I wanted to! -- to have a clean toilet. And I found that once I<br/>\nrealized there wasn&#39;t anyone making me clean, that I cleaned it a lot<br/>\nmore often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to let him have all the screen time he&#39;d like I promise<br/>\nyou it will be hard! It will be hard to make the decision. It will be<br/>\nhard on you to let go of control over a piece of your life. It will<br/>\nbe hard to see the new problems letting go creates. But the place on<br/>\nthe other side on beyond this transition period where your son sees<br/>\nscreen time as just another thing to do and not something precious to<br/>\nbe coveted is a really awesome place :-) And it will be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s something<br/>\nbetter, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house and feel<br/>\nthat tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to prevent<br/>\nsomething that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only then will<br/>\nyou be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to the list and<br/>\nsays &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I hope this group is open enough for me to be able to<br/>\n&gt; ADMIT that without serious accusations of being inadequate or the<br/>\n&gt; such.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to be the crux of the difficulties people have with this<br/>\ntype of list. Many people want places to vent, where they can air<br/>\ntheir faults and have others say &quot;Yes, I have that exact same<br/>\nproblem. I know what you&#39;re going through because I&#39;m going through<br/>\nthe same thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what support lists are for :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a discussion list. It&#39;s a place to work out the things you&#39;ve<br/>\ndecided to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are two types of people: People who want to work out<br/>\ntheir problems in private while getting support for how hard it is.<br/>\nAnd people who recognize that not being perfect is part of life and<br/>\nwant a place to work on being better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if it&#39;s personality or school that causes people to think<br/>\nthey&#39;re bad for not doing everything right? Probably personality but<br/>\nthen school makes it worse :-/ But no one on the list sees anyone as<br/>\nbad for not doing everything &quot;right&quot;. No one expects everyone to be<br/>\ndoing everything &quot;right&quot;.

The practices are like balloons that support  <br/>\ntheir fears because their fears are threatening to pull them into a  <br/>\nbottomless abyss. They *want* to hold onto the balloons and they  <br/>\ncan&#39;t understand why people find it so easy to let go.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt *isn&#39;t* easy to let go! It&#39;s scary! It takes some uncomfortable  <br/>\nself examination to let go. But what you&#39;re seeing displayed on the  <br/>\nlist is the one balloon someone has decided to let go of. You&#39;re just  <br/>\nnot seeing the other 11 balloons they&#39;re still holding onto ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people decide to let go, when they bring a practice to the list  <br/>\nthat they want help with, it isn&#39;t because it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s because  <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been examining that practice in a new light and they don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike the new vision. The new vision makes them more uncomfortable  <br/>\nthan the fear. One of their balloons doesn&#39;t look so comforting any  <br/>\nmore. They were only seeing the balloon part of the practice that was  <br/>\nholding them up and supporting their fears, but now they&#39;ve seen the  <br/>\nlead part that was weighing down their kids and holding themselves  <br/>\nback. They&#39;ve reached the point with that practice where they&#39;ve  <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s scary to let go, but I can now see that where this  <br/>\nballoon is taking me is even scarier. And I want help letting go.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that everyone has let go of all their balloons!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t assume that letting go is easy! You just haven&#39;t seen all the  <br/>\nself-examination that has gone on in private as people read the list  <br/>\nwithout posting. This is the list to post to when you&#39;ve decided to  <br/>\nlet go.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s also a good list to read to help you get to the point where  <br/>\nyou want to let go of a practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just isn&#39;t a good place to tell people why you aren&#39;t ready to let  <br/>\ngo ;-) Because everyone who posts regularly has let go of at least  <br/>\none balloon and is eager to help others let go of the ones they now  <br/>\nsee were weighing them down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At<br/>\n&gt; this point, I CAN&#39;T let my son have all the screen time he&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When you&#39;re ready to work on that, it will help yourself *hugely* to  <br/>\nsee that you are *choosing* not to let him. You don&#39;t like the  <br/>\nconsequences (they *are* temporary consequences!) of letting him have  <br/>\nall the screen time he&#39;d like. So you are *choosing* to limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is one piece of advice I could give people it would be to  <br/>\nsee everything they do as a choice. It is so incredibly freeing :-)  <br/>\nIt seems like the only reason we do so many unpleasant things in life  <br/>\nis because we don&#39;t have a choice. But it&#39;s the perception of not  <br/>\nhaving a choice makes them doubly onerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, I hated cleaning the toilet. It was just something you  <br/>\nhad to do every week (or month ;-) And just because I had to do it, I  <br/>\nnever wanted to and fought against it, often avoiding my  <br/>\nresponsibility for 6 months! But when I realized it was a choice,  <br/>\nthat I could choose to never ever ever scrub the toilet again, I  <br/>\nrealized that it was nice to see it not filthy. I could choose --  <br/>\nwhen I wanted to! -- to have a clean toilet. And I found that once I  <br/>\nrealized there wasn&#39;t anyone making me clean, that I cleaned it a lot  <br/>\nmore often.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you decide to let him have all the screen time he&#39;d like I promise  <br/>\nyou it will be hard! It will be hard to make the decision. It will be  <br/>\nhard on you to let go of control over a piece of your life. It will  <br/>\nbe hard to see the new problems letting go creates. But the place on  <br/>\nthe other side on beyond this transition period where your son sees  <br/>\nscreen time as just another thing to do and not something precious to  <br/>\nbe coveted is a really awesome place :-) And it will be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s only when you have read enough to see that there&#39;s something  <br/>\nbetter, when you&#39;ve reflected on the tension in the house and feel  <br/>\nthat tension doesn&#39;t seem a good enough compromise to prevent  <br/>\nsomething that isn&#39;t seeming as scary as it once was, only then will  <br/>\nyou be one of the perceived &quot;perfect&quot; ones who posts to the list and  <br/>\nsays &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve let go, now what?&quot; ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I hope this group is open enough for me to be able to<br/>\n&gt; ADMIT that without serious accusations of being inadequate or the<br/>\n&gt; such.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This seems to be the crux of the difficulties people have with this  <br/>\ntype of list. Many people want places to vent, where they can air  <br/>\ntheir faults and have others say &quot;Yes, I have that exact same  <br/>\nproblem. I know what you&#39;re going through because I&#39;m going through  <br/>\nthe same thing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what support lists are for :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a discussion list. It&#39;s a place to work out the things you&#39;ve  <br/>\ndecided to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are two types of people: People who want to work out  <br/>\ntheir problems in private while getting support for how hard it is.  <br/>\nAnd people who recognize that not being perfect is part of life and  <br/>\nwant a place to work on being better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if it&#39;s personality or school that causes people to think  <br/>\nthey&#39;re bad for not doing everything right? Probably personality but  <br/>\nthen school makes it worse :-/ But no one on the list sees anyone as  <br/>\nbad for not doing everything &quot;right&quot;. No one expects everyone to be  <br/>\ndoing everything &quot;right&quot;.

If it&#39;s a choice of limiting<br/>\none or two areas where you feel you absolutely must limit or chosing<br/>\nto give up on the concept of unschooling completely, it&#39;s better to<br/>\nlimit what you feel you must.  However, any time you post about the<br/>\nnecessity of limiting a particular area, you should expect this list<br/>\n(and others like it) to question that necessity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t to say that you&#39;re a bad person/parent or whatever if you<br/>\nfeel you must limit TV or food (the most common areas).  However many<br/>\npeople on this list have found an amazing connection to and trust in<br/>\ntheir children by being willing to re-evaluate their felt need to<br/>\ncontrol and limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my suggestion for those who feel they&#39;d like to unschool but just<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t bear letting go of the controls in a few areas is this:  By<br/>\nall means, take whatever stops toward unschooling you feel you can at<br/>\nthe moment.  But keep reading (and thinking about what you read) as it<br/>\nrelates to the areas that you feel you need to control.  It&#39;s quite<br/>\nlikely that in a few months or so you&#39;ll find that need to control is<br/>\ndisappearing.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 5/23/06, Tonya Matthews &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:godzilla.matthews@...\">godzilla.matthews@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s hard to trust, for me.
