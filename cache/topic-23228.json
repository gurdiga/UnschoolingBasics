I think, for me,<br/>\nthe worry came from past experiences.

Add in Andy&#39;s tendency to share every thought he ever had with anyone who stands still long enough to hear him, and I worry about the day he says something that really offends someone.  Not because I really care what that someone would think, but what would their reaction be, and how hurt would Andy be?  You know Andy, Kelly, he&#39;s such a tender soul and so clueless at times -- I&#39;m having a really hard time reconciling all this.<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*** He answered &quot;I&#39;m smarter than that, Mom.&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\n  yeah, I know he&#39;s smarter than that -- and my Mom&#39;s programming in me says that a his Mom I have a right to expect/demand that he BE smarter than that.  God, I hate it when she moves into my head!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n- - - - - - - -<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m 46 and think that Stewie and Brian are a HOOT.<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Okay -- then help me understand my issue with this.  I just knew, as I typed those words, that someone I really like here would turn out to be a fan of Family Guy.  And it helps me to hear that, because you&#39;re not at all warped -- at least not in a bad way.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I guess the show must have some redeeming value, but the issues that swirl around it still really worry me, that I&#39;m making a mistake as his Mom.<br/>\n  <br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he&#39;s being more mature than you are a this point: he&#39;s trying to make *you* feel good about your position. He&#39;s going out of his way to let you know your feelings are validated and heard.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, I already know I&#39;m not always as mature as I could be.  The question for me is how do I get that mature, when it goes against every prejudice I was raised with?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  **** All I could think is -- by the time he&#39;s 13 or 15, how warped will he already<br/>\nbe watching that stuff?***<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWarped enough to hang out at my house. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ******<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling much better and much less &#39;high-stakes&#39; worried about it, just knowing the Lovejoys watch Family Guy.  I know it&#39;s old programming in my head and I want to get past it, but really I just want to snap my heels together and make it go away.... &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I really want to make some peace with this, but I have to say if I were dating<br/>\na guy and he told me he liked Family Guy -- that would be our last date, because<br/>\neewww!****<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron will be hurt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Honestly -- if Gary had told me that, I&#39;d have still gone out with him.  I just would have mortified if anyone else knew he liked that show. &lt;beg&gt;  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  ******<br/>\nI&#39;m not a big fam of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (Ben&#39;s taking Dunc to see that this weekend) or Robot Chicken or Something-Lab- Numbers (Can&#39;t remember the name--underwater thing---AquaLab2000 ??? I can&#39;t remember). So I don&#39;t watch them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  Andy expressed an interest in seeing this movie.  I didn&#39;t even know he watched that show and haven&#39;t watched it myself, but did make a note to check it out and let him know if we could see the movie.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  ALL of these (plus the Simpsons) have opened up sooooo many avenues for deep discussions. Vulgar, yes---but most of that goes over Dunc&#39;s head---unless we&#39;re laughing so hard that we have to explain. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, Sylvia! Big fans here! Will you still come to the conference? <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, watching these shows will not make them bad people. All four of us (five with the girlfriend) have pretty level heads---and none of us believe that dogs smoke, drink Martinis, or talk. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  Of course, we&#39;ll still come to the conference -- I love y&#39;all.  And finding out you like those shows makes me feel less worried about it all.  But I have to ask how is y&#39;all are so warped and I never knew it? &lt;beg&gt;  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia  -- still apparently taking myself way too seriously after all these years......<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

And you&#39;re being disappointed by their actions. You&#39;re being frustrated that they aren&#39;t molding themselves into your vision of them. You&#39;re telling them why you <br/>\ndon&#39;t like those shows and *expecting* that they&#39;ll eventually see why you&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong. I think you&#39;re taking in what they say about the shows but listening only enough to hear whether they&#39;re growing to agree with you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ***<br/>\n  Oh, I know this is what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;m channelling my Mom at those moments, except that she did ban anything she found unacceptable.  And I really want to get past this, but it&#39;s proving really hard for me, on a very personal and scary level.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, before I go on, I really do appreciate what you have to say -- that&#39;s why I posted this here, because I wanted to hear from you and Ren and Kelly -- other Moms who won&#39;t let me get away with anything.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  You aren&#39;t *really* listening to them. You aren&#39;t working at understanding why they enjoy the shows. You&#39;re working to get them to see the shows through *your* eyes and aren&#39;t working to see the show through *their* eyes. You wonder why they aren&#39;t changing to your point of view and aren&#39;t even trying to see their point of view. You understand letting kids make their own choices intellectually but it&#39;s come up against reality and your feelings are blocking you from putting it into practice. We have to let them choose even stuff we don&#39;t like!<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I agree with the principle of them choosing to watch/hear/see stuff we don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s in reality in my house that&#39;s uncomfortable, and scares me.  When even Will -- who has some out there tastes -- tells me Andy is too young to watch those shows and looks at me like I&#39;m out of my mind that I wonder.  When even my 22yo son thinks his younger brother is too young for it, am I still right or have I gone too far in &#39;letting&#39; the boys choose for themselves?  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nYou&#39;re *assuming* that because they enjoy a certain type of humor that they want to be like that. What foundation does that fear have? What evidence do you have that watching or even being drawn to a certain interest changes who someone is? Do kids who play video games *become* violent? Or are there two types of kids who may end up playing violent video games: Those who get a thrill from *vicariously* doing what they don&#39;t want to do in real life, and those who are filled with rage because of a horrid home life and want to hurt things? (There&#39;s probably a whole spectrum in between.)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  hhmmm.... I don&#39;t really believe that violent video games lead to violence, but for some reason the TV thing is harder for me to tease out.  What fear do I have?  I need to sit with that one for a while.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nPeople enjoy lots of stuff through entertainment that they don&#39;t want to experience in real life. I might appreciate the skills of a ninja to kill of a dozen people without a sound, but I wouldn&#39;t want to live a life where that&#39;s probable! I wouldn&#39;t want to go through what&#39;s needed to become someone who could do that. Appreciating something isn&#39;t the same as wanting it for yourself.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I can see this -- when you explain it, but when my kids try to defend the same principle, it scares me. <br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\nI think you need to watch the shows and give it a truly honest try. I think instead of trying to get them to change their minds you need to find out what it is they enjoy. Talk to them. Ask them what they like and what they don&#39;t like. *Don&#39;t* project their likes into some future warping. There&#39;s no evidence that what we enjoy in entertainment says anything about how we act in society. Far as I know Stephen King doesn&#39;t have dead bodies in his basement ;-) He&#39;s still married to his original wife and has 3 grown kids. *Could* you project that from looking at what he enjoys for entertainment?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I&#39;ve watched the shows several times -- I just can&#39;t sit thru it anymore.  I know when I watched Andy was hoping I&#39;d enoy it, but I just can&#39;t pretend I like it.  He&#39;s just as fervently hoping his influence will affect me as I am hoping mine will influence him -- and I&#39;m just not able to meet him halfway on this one.  Not yet anyway.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\nIt may be that you won&#39;t be able to enjoy the shows for yourself. But it will help build a relationship with them if you work up an appreciation for their appreciation. It may be that those shows will always be liver to you, but your kids wouldn&#39;t want to live in an atmosphere of people always negatively commenting on their choice of liver at a restaurant in order to try to change their minds and think &quot;right&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I can see the argument you&#39;re making, but this is way more disgusting than even liver to me &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

I give him the same attention that *I* would want someone to give me!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I do listen, and we talk about why such a joke/story would be funny -- the context behind the joke and so on.  Gary won&#39;t listen at all, so Andy doesn&#39;t even try to share that with him anymore.  I figure, even when I don&#39;t like the humor, I want to know what Andy is getting from what he watches and to better understand what he&#39;s thinking.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  And I really want to find some way to be comfortable with this.  I&#39;m not naive enough to think this will be the last time Andy will choose something we don&#39;t understand or like.  Hey, I have a limewire download file filled with band names like Goatwhore and Eyehategod -- stuff Will downloads -- so I know my kids aren&#39;t always going to make the same choices I do. &lt;g&gt;  I just want to reach some level where it&#39;s less stressful for me to know what they&#39;re choosing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\nI certainly would not want someone to pass judgment about my character based on my entertainment preferences! I would not want to defend myself to anyone about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ******<br/>\n  I know it&#39;s my junk and I really would like to get to the point where I don&#39;t feel so judgmental about it.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Something even harder for me to understand happened later with Andy.  He came in and told me about the ending of a Duck Dodgers cartoon he&#39;d watched where the villain/opponent (I&#39;m not sure what to call the little boy) had come in and stolen all of Duck&#39;s food/dinner, as the show ended.  That was to be end gag, I guess and probably considered funny by the viewers.  At first Andy shared it as if it were funny, but within minutes he was crying - yes, actually crying -- at how sad it was that Duck now had no food, and why had that little boy been so mean?  But he finds it hilarious when Stewie is inside an exercise ball painted black, rolling around bumping into things?  Okay, what&#39;s going on here -- starving cartoon ducks are sad, but cartoon babies bouncing around like a blind pinball is funny?  Help me out here....<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  A couple of more thoughts: First, a lot of the raunchier humor in those two shows goes right over Liam&#39;s head. Perhaps it&#39;s that way for your sons, too?<br/>\n<br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  I&#39;m sure it goes over Dan&#39;s head, but Andy tells the jokes and laughs -- he very obviously finds it funny.  I usually explain context to help him understand why others might not find it funny, or even find it offensive.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  <br/>\nAlso, I used to really *not* like that show Ed, Edd, and Eddy, but liam really, really liked it. I kept my feelings *entirely* to myself as best I could and I&#39;d watch it with him whenever I <br/>\ncould. Sure &#39;nuff, he *detests* the show now! One of the things that I didn&#39;t like about the show was that the personality traits some of the characters had were awful!! But, I could see how Liam could hang on to his own good character and still find that show funny. Just because he found the show funny did not mean he was going to be like those characters!<br/>\n<br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I&#39;m not crazy about the Eds myself -- but they can be pretty funny at times, and totally not as mean-spirited as Family Guy.  Both boys love the Eds and I&#39;m okay with that.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  ****<br/>\n  <br/>\nIt&#39;s really important to remember that a TV show really does not have the kind of influence on a person&#39;s personality that a person&#39;s peers has. In other words, kids generally are influenced by who they hang with most often (which is you, right?). Andy&#39;s assertion that he is &quot;smarter than that&quot; is an important one. If you can accept that he can watch and enjoy really stupid stuff and yet not *be* stupid, you can let go of a lot of your fears and  judgments. Then, his decision to watch or not watch can be based purely on what he thinks and feels and not as a reaction to your reaction. Know what I mean?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  *****<br/>\n  I don&#39;t really worry as much about its influence as I&#39;m perplexed by why he finds it funny.  And, for the record, I don&#39;t mind that it&#39;s stupid -- but I&#39;m really uncomfortable with how mean-spirited the show is.  And on some level, if a person finds that funny, I have to wonder how &#39;safe&#39; that person is to me, given my own sensitivities.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Lots more to think about tho.... off to read more replies.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

The gross humor (lots of bodily noises and<br/>\nsuch)? Being able to experiment, virtually through these characters,<br/>\nwith behaviors they have never seen/heard? If, by the time he&#39;s 13 or<br/>\nwhatever and he chooses not to watch that anymore, will he really be<br/>\n&quot;warped&quot; by it or will he have had his fill of farts and burps and butt<br/>\ncracks and moved on?<br/>\n <br/>\nI remember when DS started watching Spongebob. I sat and watched one or<br/>\ntwo episodes and REALLY disliked it - it was lots of put-downs,<br/>\nsarcastic &quot;humor&quot;, rude behavior. Some episodes were even kind of<br/>\n&#39;dark&#39;. I let DS know that my choice was to just go someplace else while<br/>\nhe watched that because ... and I pointed out specific issues I had with<br/>\nit. Then I dropped it. When it came on, I&#39;d quietly just &#39;drift&#39; off to<br/>\nsomeplace else - read a magazine in the next room or whatever. Same<br/>\nthing I&#39;d do if DH wanted to watch a somewhat scary movie. My choice to<br/>\nleave or not, their choice to watch or not. There are times when DS<br/>\nchooses to watch something I dislike. Other times, he&#39;d rather find a<br/>\ncompromise something in the moment, knowing he can watch whatever it is<br/>\nlater sometime, when I&#39;m at work or doing dishes or whatever. Over time,<br/>\nhowever, he hasn&#39;t picked up any of the negative stuff. He&#39;s all about<br/>\nthe relationships and the funny stuff. <br/>\n <br/>\nI agree with your DS - he probably is lots smarter than you&#39;re giving<br/>\nhim credit for. And, too, what IF he did continue on to think that it<br/>\nwas funny when he was 20 or 30 or 40 years old? There -are- other adults<br/>\nout there who -also- would think it was funny (there are adults who<br/>\nwrite these shows after all). Just because -you- wouldn&#39;t date him<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t a bunch of others his age who would love to<br/>\ndate a guy who loves the same shows, has the same memories of watching<br/>\ncertain shows, that they have. <br/>\n <br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

And you&#39;re being disappointed by  <br/>\ntheir actions. You&#39;re being frustrated that they aren&#39;t molding  <br/>\nthemselves into your vision of them. You&#39;re telling them why you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t like those shows and *expecting* that they&#39;ll eventually see  <br/>\nwhy you&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong. I think you&#39;re taking in what  <br/>\nthey say about the shows but listening only enough to hear whether  <br/>\nthey&#39;re growing to agree with you. You aren&#39;t *really* listening to  <br/>\nthem. You aren&#39;t working at understanding why they enjoy the shows.  <br/>\nYou&#39;re working to get them to see the shows through *your* eyes and  <br/>\naren&#39;t working to see the show through *their* eyes. You wonder why  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t changing to your point of view and aren&#39;t even trying to  <br/>\nsee their point of view. You understand letting kids make their own  <br/>\nchoices intellectually but it&#39;s come up against reality and your  <br/>\nfeelings are blocking you from putting it into practice. We have to  <br/>\nlet them choose even stuff we don&#39;t like!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re *assuming* that because they enjoy a certain type of humor  <br/>\nthat they want to be like that. What foundation does that fear have?  <br/>\nWhat evidence do you have that watching or even being drawn to a  <br/>\ncertain interest changes who someone is? Do kids who play video games  <br/>\n*become* violent? Or are there two types of kids who may end up  <br/>\nplaying violent video games: Those who get a thrill from  <br/>\n*vicariously* doing what they don&#39;t want to do in real life, and  <br/>\nthose who are filled with rage because of a horrid home life and want  <br/>\nto hurt things? (There&#39;s probably a whole spectrum in between.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said that both Boris Karloff and the woman who played the Wicked  <br/>\nWitch in Wizard of Oz were very sweet people. I&#39;m a peaceful person  <br/>\nand really hate destroying things in real life, but I enjoy the  <br/>\nGodzilla and Super Smash Brothers video games and fantasy and science  <br/>\nfiction action movies where things get sliced and diced and blown up.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople enjoy lots of stuff through entertainment that they don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto experience in real life. I might appreciate the skills of a ninja  <br/>\nto kill of a dozen people without a sound, but I wouldn&#39;t want to  <br/>\nlive a life where that&#39;s probable! I wouldn&#39;t want to go through  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s needed to become someone who could do that. Appreciating  <br/>\nsomething isn&#39;t the same as wanting it for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you need to watch the shows and give it a truly honest try. I  <br/>\nthink instead of trying to get them to change their minds you need to  <br/>\nfind out what it is they enjoy. Talk to them. Ask them what they like  <br/>\nand what they don&#39;t like. *Don&#39;t* project their likes into some  <br/>\nfuture warping. There&#39;s no evidence that what we enjoy in  <br/>\nentertainment says anything about how we act in society. Far as I  <br/>\nknow Stephen King doesn&#39;t have dead bodies in his basement ;-) He&#39;s  <br/>\nstill married to his original wife and has 3 grown kids. *Could* you  <br/>\nproject that from looking at what he enjoys for entertainment?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be that you won&#39;t be able to enjoy the shows for yourself. But  <br/>\nit will help build a relationship with them if you work up an  <br/>\nappreciation for their appreciation. It may be that those shows will  <br/>\nalways be liver to you, but your kids wouldn&#39;t want to live in an  <br/>\natmosphere of people always negatively commenting on their choice of  <br/>\nliver at a restaurant in order to try to change their minds and think  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96545052,"authorName":"marji","from":"&quot;marji&quot; &lt;marji@...&gt;","profile":"gaia10921","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: TV choices","postDate":"1176891098","msgId":23230,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYwNHFzcSt0bG1rQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ0NDA3NC4yOTY0Ni5xbUB3ZWI1MzgxMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":23229,"nextInTopic":23231,"prevInTime":23229,"nextInTime":23231,"topicId":23228,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you know that &quot;what you resist persists,&quot; right?  The <br/>\nattention you place on feeling yucky about these shows and your <br/>\nobvious contempt for them (whether you have blatant contempt or only <br/>\nthinly veiled contempt) is like a giant, lit-up arrow pointing right <br/>\nat these shows.  I believe this falls under the <br/>\nthere&#39;s-no-such-thing-as-bad-publicity category.  All the grousing <br/>\nthat you and Gary are doing about these shows is not allowing these <br/>\nshows to take a smaller role in Andy and Dan&#39;s lives.  Can you see that?<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider this perhaps:  You have made it plain here through this <br/>\nelectronic medium that you feel quite judgmental about these shows <br/>\n*and* even judgmental about folks who like those shows.  If I&#39;m able <br/>\nto pick that feeling up here at my computer, and I&#39;m not even in the <br/>\nsame room with you, image what vibes Andy and Dan are picking up from <br/>\nyou and Gary!  Is it possible (and, I&#39;m not saying it is) that the <br/>\npersonal judgment they may be feeling from you and Gary could be more <br/>\nharmful than enjoying stupid humor?  Is it possible that you may be <br/>\ninflicting a little shame on them for liking what you feel is not likeable?<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out, Liam (my 12-year-old son) really likes those two <br/>\nshows.  His life, however, does not revolve around them.  He&#39;s not <br/>\neven really willing to stay up to watch them if he&#39;s tired.  But, if <br/>\nhe has a friend staying over, then they&#39;ll definitely watch the <br/>\nshows.  I&#39;ve been invited to watch with him/them, and if I can I <br/>\ndo.  Or, I might tell him that it&#39;s just not my cup of tea.  But, if <br/>\nhe wants to tell me about something he found to be funny, I give him <br/>\nthe attention that I would give anyone who wants to share something <br/>\nwith me that *they* appreciate.  I give him the same attention that <br/>\n*I* would want someone to give me!<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly would not want someone to pass judgment about my <br/>\ncharacter based on my entertainment preferences!  I would not want to <br/>\ndefend myself to anyone about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of more thoughts:  First, a lot of the raunchier humor in <br/>\nthose two shows goes right over Liam&#39;s head.  Perhaps it&#39;s that way <br/>\nfor your sons, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I used to really *not* like that show Ed, Edd, and Eddy, but <br/>\nLiam really, really liked it.  I kept my feelings *entirely* to <br/>\nmyself as best I could and I&#39;d watch it with him whenever I <br/>\ncould.  Sure &#39;nuff, he *detests* the show now!  One of the things <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t like about the show was that the personality traits <br/>\nsome of the characters had were awful!!  But, I could see how Liam <br/>\ncould hang on to his own good character and still find that show <br/>\nfunny.  Just because he found the show funny did not mean he was <br/>\ngoing to be like those characters!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important to remember that a TV show really does not have <br/>\nthe kind of influence on a person&#39;s personality that a person&#39;s peers <br/>\nhas.  In other words, kids generally are influenced by who they hang <br/>\nwith most often (which is you, right?).   Andy&#39;s assertion that he is <br/>\n&quot;smarter than that&quot; is an important one.  If you can accept that he <br/>\ncan watch and enjoy really stupid stuff and yet not *be* stupid, you <br/>\ncan let go of a lot of your fears and judgments.  Then, his decision <br/>\nto watch or not watch can be based purely on what he thinks and feels <br/>\nand not as a reaction to your reaction.  Know what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywhoo, them&#39;s my thoughts!  I hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji (never a big fan of TV anyway, but Liam and I are two entirely <br/>\ndifferent people, and he is allowed to be who HE is; he doesn&#39;t have to be me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 01:12 4/18/2007, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The boys&#39; choices in TV viewing continue to pose problems for us.

Really, on a deeper level -- <br/>\nand having read so many people whose kids could choose to watch <br/>\nundesirable shows but don&#39;e -- I fully expected that soon the novelty <br/>\nwould wear off, and my sweet, kind, thoughtful kids would show their <br/>\ntrue colors and watch something else -- anything else!  It&#39;s been <br/>\nseveral months now, and still he loves those shows.  Gary is <br/>\nbeginning to really question whether I&#39;m right to &#39;let&#39; them watch <br/>\nthose shows.  He&#39;d really like to ban those shows, but I&#39;m not really <br/>\ncomfortable -- at least in principle -- with banning anything.  Even <br/>\nWill, at 22, thinks I&#39;m wrong to let his younger brothers watch those <br/>\nshows.  It&#39;s even harder for me when I agree in principle/theory, but <br/>\nin reality their choices are indefensible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, on to today.  Earlier tonight, I noticed that the boys were <br/>\nreally enjoying the dish preview of Boomerang (we don&#39;t subscribe to <br/>\nBoomerang -- it&#39;s $20 extra where we live) watching it right thru the <br/>\nthem they&#39;d normally watch Futurama.  I quietly said to Gary &quot;see, <br/>\nwhen they have Boomerang to watch, they forget all about Futurama, <br/>\nand maybe even Family Guy -- maybe we should think about boomerang <br/>\nwhen we can afford it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few moments ago -- as I&#39;m catching up on my DVR&#39;d shows, Andy <br/>\ncomes out and asks me to set it up to DVR Futurama at midnight.  <br/>\nAlso, they&#39;d watched Family Guy, just in Andy&#39;s room where we don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to hear it (that&#39;s at our request, it&#39;s the best compromise we <br/>\ncould live with, since neither of us is willing to sit thru even one <br/>\nepisode of Family Guy).  I said I had noticed he missed the earlier <br/>\nrun of Futurama watching boomerang, and did he really want to watch <br/>\ncrap when he had other choices?  Of course, he was upset.  I <br/>\napologized for calling it crap, but it was too late.  Both boys know <br/>\nhow we feel about those shows, and I know no good is served by <br/>\nreminding them we disapprove, but I&#39;m just so tired of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my real problem tho -- we&#39;ve both told them what we find <br/>\nobjectionable about those shows.  Andy will still tell me jokes he <br/>\nheard on those shows, or ask me about some storyline he didn&#39;t get, <br/>\nand I answer his questions.  I&#39;ll admit I sometimes point out how <br/>\nmuch I dislike the show. Today, after he shared a particularly ugly <br/>\nepisode, I again explained what made that kind of humor unattractive <br/>\nto others -- and unacceptable to his Dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been really, really hoping they&#39;d move past that trash, but <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t and the longer it goes on, the harder it is for me to <br/>\ndefend their right to that choice -- even to myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I doing wrong here?  What&#39;s wrong with my kids that they like <br/>\nthose shows and find that humor funny?  What kind of people am I <br/>\nraising?<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23305,"nextTopicId":23287}}
