You<br/>\nwill encounter storms; you may be wrecked. But in the long run, the<br/>\nuniverse is on the side of those who trust their own minds, value<br/>\nsupremely their own experiences, and dare to sail under their own, true<br/>\ncolors.&quot;<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; UU Minister: Harry Scholefield~<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Connections, connections. Yesterday, I received a very special gift<br/>\nfrom a dear woman and I sat to read it tonight. It&#39;s about William<br/>\nCopperthwaite, a man that believed in living simply and close to the<br/>\nearth. His work is so inspirational to me.<br/>\nAnyway, the above quote made me think of the opening quote in the book:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The main thrust of my work is not simple living--not yurt design, not<br/>\nsocial change, although each of these is important and receives large<br/>\nblocks of my time. But they are not central.  My central concern is<br/>\nencouragement--encouraging people to seek, to experiment, to plan, to<br/>\ncreate, and to dream.  If enough people do this we will find a better<br/>\nway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is titled &quot;A Handmade Life&quot; with photographs by Peter Forbes. <br/>\nAwesome stuff.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14902,"nextTopicId":14952}}
