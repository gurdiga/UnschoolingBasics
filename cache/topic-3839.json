Should be in the library. &quot;How to <br/>\nTeach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; is just AWFUL, in my <br/>\nnot-so-humble-opinion. Drudgery, boring, lifeless, one-size-fits-all, <br/>\nand if I&#39;d imposed that on my kids I cannot imagine how they&#39;d have <br/>\nbecome the voracious readers they are today.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate a print-rich environment - in many more ways than just reading <br/>\ntogether. But, do pick some books that he might pick up the reading in, <br/>\nquickly, like Hop on Pop, so that he has a chance at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA whole little series of books by Patty Wolcott are funny, and have <br/>\nlots of repetition and are rhythmic - my kids learned to recognize big <br/>\nwords, like &quot;Marvelous&quot; and that felt great to them.  (Marvelous Mud <br/>\nWashing Machine - our favorite, along with the Cake Book)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis own &quot;Word Box.&quot; A cool box - you ask him, &quot;What words do you want <br/>\nto learn to read?&quot; You write those words carefully on an index card. He <br/>\nkeeps his words in his box. When HE wants to practice his reading, he <br/>\npulls the box out and goes over the words, asking you if he forgets <br/>\nany. It is okay if the words are dinosaur and alligator and umbrella. <br/>\nThey don&#39;t have to be &quot;beginning&quot; reading words.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhyming games - lots of them. We played in the car a lot - but you <br/>\ncould do it to satisfy his desire for his reading lessons. You say <br/>\n&quot;SAM&quot; and he responds with &quot;HAM&quot; and then you say &quot;CLAM&quot; and he says <br/>\n&quot;SPAM&quot; and so on - trying to go as long as you can. Start with the <br/>\nshort &quot;a&quot; sound and when you&#39;ve exhausted all your ideas for that move <br/>\non to other short vowels sounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn the alphabet song with sounds instead of letter names. &quot;Ah&quot;, <br/>\n&quot;Beh&quot;, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagnetic letters on the refrigerator - there are some that have shapes <br/>\n- like a farmer on a tractor - in two parts with &quot;F A&quot; on one part and <br/>\n&quot;R M&quot; on the other half.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on -- there are a million ways to &quot;teach reading&quot; - but don&#39;t <br/>\ntake over from him, find ways to support his learning, not to impose it <br/>\non him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;While i&#39;m asking...Jaiden loves math, and everyday asks me to give<br/>\nhim a page of math problems. I spend 10-15min trying to think up good<br/>\nones, he&#39;s done with them in like 2 min and then tells me he wants<br/>\nmath problems, not math easys. &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis cracks me up. Rosie, not too long ago, got irritated with me <br/>\nbecause I was explaining something to her that she&#39;d asked about and <br/>\nshe wanted practice problems to try it out, but the ones I gave her <br/>\nwere too easy. She very strongly said, &quot;Mom, please CHALLENGE me, just <br/>\nCHALLENGE me, that&#39;s all I ask.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nRoxana was here and heard her and said, &quot;Hey, Mom, I bet you wish you <br/>\nhad THAT on tape for your math talks, huh?&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you google &quot;math worksheets creation&quot; I think you&#39;ll find sites that <br/>\ndo that.

I don&#39;t know how. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sam showed desire to read, he&#39;d be all for sitting down with me for about half an hour and reading with him, helping him to read, and then he&#39;d be up and off and living his life as joyfully as before the request to learn to read...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we&#39;d use games and post-it notes (play with letters and words) and we read all the time together...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut nothing really mattered because he just wasn&#39;t *ready* to read, even though the desire was there once in awhile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 10 1/2 now and he&#39;s been *just* picking up reading connections lately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s happened slowly and over a long period of time...but he makes more and more connections every single day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, there are things you can do...but I think it&#39;s also important to let him know that sometimes it doesn&#39;t happen just because you WANT it to happen...sometimes it still takes a while for it all to *click* and *connect*.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have the *Bob* books and we love those.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439145449/104-5752708-4457542?v=glance\">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439145449/104-5752708-4457542?v=glance</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nWe actually were able to make fun of them while reading their simple stories...and that helped Sam to enjoy them more! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd post-it notes are invaluable.  I wrote letters on them and Sam played around with them, moving the letters around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also took his favorite words and wrote them on 3 X 5 cards, with illustrations surrounding the word.  For example, Sam loves the word *Tsunami* so I wrote it on a card with a big wave behind it.  Any word that he was drawn to, I would draw like this and hang them up.  Just for him to *see*, not necessarily *learn right then how to read or spell it*.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, I put a geometry school poster in the bathroom because I thought it was cool and something interesting to look at...Sam walked out of the bathroom one day saying over and over again, &quot;Parallelogram...Parallelogram...Parallelogram...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one ever told him that&#39;s what that poster said.<br/>\n<br/>\n***he&#39;s done with them in like 2 min and then tells me he wants <br/>\nmath problems, not math easys.***<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!
