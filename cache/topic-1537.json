This might work<br/>\nfor  some kids, it might de-sensitize them to things you don&#39;t want them to<br/>\nbe  de-sensitized too and on another hand, it might just serve to heighten<br/>\nthe  sensitivity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my family, de-sensitizing was the theme for me,  as I was always perceived<br/>\nto be TOO sensitive. So it was believed that if I  was just tormented enough<br/>\nI would stop being TOO sensitive. I had rubber  spiders and snakes thrown at<br/>\nme regularly, to this day I still shake when I  see them in stores and can<br/>\nnot touch a page with them on it. I was forced  into dark rooms and am still<br/>\nafraid of the dark. I was forced to eat worms  and still am afraid of them.<br/>\nIt went on and on.. I won&#39;t bore you. The end  result is, all these things<br/>\nwere/are still funny to my family, my reaction  is still funny and I am even<br/>\nMORE sensitive than before. None of it  de-sensitized me. it heightened my<br/>\nsensitivity to having an expectation of  people doing the worst to me always.<br/>\nLots of work to get over it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nBig, BIG difference between being forced to watch a scary movie over and  <br/>\nover and being *allowed* to watch one or only the parts you want to. Between  <br/>\nbeing forced into dark rooms and walking in incrementally when you&#39;re ready with  <br/>\nyour hand on the switch. Between having rubber snakes thrown at you and <br/>\nslowly  approaching one with a stick in your hand.<br/>\n <br/>\nBig difference.
