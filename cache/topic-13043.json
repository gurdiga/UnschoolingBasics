Fresh fruit, veggies<br/>\n all chopped up, dip to go with it, crackers, cheese sticks, chips,<br/>\n chocolates. I fill up the bowls that get empty. Our two yo will<br/>\n gravitate towards his favorites, but overall tries everything IF I<br/>\n add no pressure. and IF I keep everything else filled up. It really<br/>\n does work, just breath and have faith ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n We have a big family, and so really it&#39;s important for us to ensure<br/>\n that the bowls will stay full, if only to settle the kids minds that<br/>\n they don&#39;t have to eat all that they can at one setting for fear of<br/>\n someone else eating their favorites! Thankfully Emily is getting over<br/>\n that fear, she would guard the snack trays and police how much people<br/>\n were eating to ensure fairness. lol!<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yeah---we have a bowl of candy at all times in the front hall. It&#39;s <br/>\nbeen full of M&Ms lately. There are still a few handfuls in there now. <br/>\nBut I just got some Laffy Taffy, so the M&Ms are covered up right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just brought out a &quot;Monkey Platter&quot; for Duncan and his friend, <br/>\nEbony. There are carrots with dill dip, bagel chips smeared with <br/>\nBabaganoush, tiny mini- bananas (they&#39;re so cute!), wheat thins with <br/>\nsliced cheese, rolled up ham slices, and mini-Rice Krispy Treats. <br/>\nDuncan has eaten a bit of everything. Ebony (who is seriously limited <br/>\njust asked for more Rice Krispy Treats). There will probably be a few <br/>\ncarrots left on the plate when Dunc brings it to the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\n  You *might* like to try letting her get her fill of crisps (potato <br/>\nchips for the non-Brits who were wondering! &lt;g&gt;). Buy a zillion <br/>\ndifferent bags, open them all, and let her go at it. I bet she&#39;d get <br/>\ntired of them after a while! You and she could have a chip and dip <br/>\nparty---buy or make a bunch of dips that would go with chips. Have a <br/>\nblind taste test! Together you could rate the chips and the dip. OOOH! <br/>\nYou could deep fry your own! And make SWEET potato chips! And turnip <br/>\nchips! and.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I bet she&#39;d be asking for tomato soup or PB&J or broccoli after a <br/>\nwhile! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I think Melissa&#39;s point of keeping the bowls full is extremely <br/>\nimportant! So she doesn&#39;t feel a lack.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I forget how old she is, but a lot of kids go through food phases. I <br/>\nremember, when I was 3, I only ate Rice Krispies for weeks and weeks. <br/>\nNeither of my boys had food issues---both were/are *very* easy eaters. <br/>\nBecause *I* was force-fed and was made to force-feed kids I baby-sat, I <br/>\nvowed I would NOT do that to my kids. I&#39;ve never had a problem, <br/>\nbut...was it because I didn&#39;t force the issue that they ate everything <br/>\nor did they eat everything so I didn&#39;t have to force the issue???<br/>\n<br/>\n  But they both have had friends who were picky and/or were on a single <br/>\nfood kick. Makes you feel like crap that they only eat one thing or <br/>\nwon&#39;t try different things, but the bigger the deal about it, the <br/>\nlonger it takes to go away---and the more control they seem to <br/>\nwant/need!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I seriously doubt she will keep this up forever! &lt;g&gt; Indulge it for a <br/>\nbit, and see what happens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n Conference Coordinator<br/>\n Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n “Learn as if you were going to live forever.<br/>\n Live as if you were going to die tomorrow.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] food question","postDate":"1147717921","msgId":13197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJFNzNDMTg1LTg0MzItNDk4OC05RDM1LTExNUU1OUMwQjJFQkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1GNUNENjlBMEMzMUZFM0FBRjEzN0Q4REJBMzBAcGh4LmdibD4=","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTEwNi1GNUNENjlBMEMzMUZFM0FBRjEzN0Q4REJBMzBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":13155,"nextInTopic":13203,"prevInTime":13196,"nextInTime":13198,"topicId":13043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What we have is a variety of snacks out all day.

Unfortunately, for reasons  <br/>\n&gt; that are poorly understood, a few children don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; this part of  <br/>\n&gt; socialization. Years after toddler tantrums should have become an  <br/>\n&gt; unpleasant memory, a few unlucky parents find themselves battling  <br/>\n&gt; with sudden, inexplicable, disturbingly violent rages--along with  <br/>\n&gt; crushing guilt about what they &quot;did wrong.&quot; Medical experts haven&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; helped much: the flurry of acronyms and labels (Tourette&#39;s, ADHD,  <br/>\n&gt; ADD, etc.) seems to proffer new discoveries about the causes of  <br/>\n&gt; such explosions, when in fact the only new development is  <br/>\n&gt; alternative vocabulary to describe the effects. Ross Greene, a  <br/>\n&gt; pediatric psychologist who also teaches at Harvard Medical School,  <br/>\n&gt; makes a bold and humane attempt in this book to cut through the  <br/>\n&gt; blather and speak directly to the (usually desperate) parents of  <br/>\n&gt; explosive children. His text is long and serious, and has the  <br/>\n&gt; advantage of covering an enormous amount of ground with nuance,  <br/>\n&gt; detail, and sympathy, but also perhaps the disadvantage that only  <br/>\n&gt; those parents who are not chronically tired and time-deprived are  <br/>\n&gt; likely to get through the entire book.

Could he make origami shapes that could hold easy to eat foods<br/>\nsuch as nuts or raisins or cubes of cheese.  He could eat while he folds.<br/>\nOr maybe make him a smoothy with yogurt or ice cream and fruit.  Something<br/>\nhe could drink while he works through his need to create.  I look at all the<br/>\ntimes that I have learned to do something and how I have been saddened by<br/>\nother things that I need to do instead.  Such as laundry, dishes, caring for<br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s needs.  Oh to have the freedom to create until I have become<br/>\n&quot;created out.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also sit with him and say something like, &quot;I&#39;m having a &lt;peanut<br/>\nbutter sandwich&gt;.  Would you like a bite while you fold?  Have you sat and<br/>\nmade origami with him?  Is there truly anything wrong with making origami<br/>\nnight and day?  There is plenty of time to eat and take showers.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141440271,"authorName":"drusila00","from":"&quot;drusila00&quot; &lt;drusila00@...&gt;","profile":"drusila00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"sometimes his passions make me nervious.","postDate":"1147552219","msgId":13043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0NWZrcitsdDlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13044,"prevInTime":13042,"nextInTime":13044,"topicId":13043,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"this week my son has been making origami, there are literaly hundreds of Origami creations filling his room, we were at a restraunt and he made an origami swan","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1411701368\">this week my son has been making origami, there are literaly hundreds <br/>\nof Origami creations filling his room, we were at a restraunt and he <br/>\nmade an origami swan from the napkin and the paper check list. he <br/>\nrefused to eat and made origami instead- he gave several people we <br/>\nknew who work in the restraunt origami things- they didn&#39;t quite know <br/>\nhow to respond, looked confused but were polite.<br/>\nhe went around asking everyone if they did Origami too. no one did. <br/>\nand he got a lot of weird looks.<br/>\n We went to a campfire and he asked his dad to bring his origami book <br/>\nand paper and a flashlight. he made Origami all night. we came home at <br/>\n1 am.
