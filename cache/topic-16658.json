I haven&#39;t realised how much energy the canicule <br/>\nwas draining out of me ... and I&#39;ve become quite good in sharing <br/>\ntime with my kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to thank you for all your good advice ... and for the <br/>\ngood spirit you have breathed on us ! I&#39;m really amazed on the <br/>\nfreedom and energy unschooling has already given us ! And especially <br/>\nme. I&#39;m a kind of learning addict, I already knew that, but <br/>\nsomething has changed - it has expanded in completely new areas, <br/>\nsuch as parenting, for instance ;) Now, when I don&#39;t like the way I <br/>\nam with the kids, I&#39;m not feeling desperate nor a failure - I&#39;m <br/>\nlike &quot;All right, this is something I don&#39;t know yet, let&#39;s learn&quot;. <br/>\nThat&#39;s GREAT.
