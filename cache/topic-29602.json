We just recently added a couple of computers to the house and set them all up on high speed so this is a fun new world of exploration for us. my 16 yr old is a geek of the first order(we call him our resident geek and our 22 yr old our professional geek) and it looks like a couple of the younger&#39;s will be following along. I love my computer for emails and research, but with some of mine it seems like an natural extension of their bodies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks also for the book recommendation, If we don&#39;t get too many inches of snow today I&#39;ll stop by the library and book store on my way home from mom&#39;s appt. today. She finished radiation to the tumors in her lower spine last Friday so we are in to see the head of her team today.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie in MN<br/>\nmom to the darlin&#39; dozen.(Hoping we will be changing this to the bakers dozen in about 7 months!)

They are both very child friendly and Toontown has won<br/>\nthe parenting award several years running.   Both promote reading skills<br/>\nwithout the children knowing it.   Neopets is interesting in that you<br/>\n&quot;adopt&quot; pets and have to feed them, and read to them if you want their<br/>\nintelligence to increase, etc.  Jellyneo.net is a great help website for<br/>\nunderstanding the game and how it works.   You can have a shop,<br/>\nadvertise it on the boards, etc.   I have a Neopets account, as well,<br/>\nand we give gifts to each other.  I&#39;m karatekidsmom if you want to visit<br/>\nme on the site.  My son has even learned to utilize  html code as a<br/>\nresult of this game!<br/>\n<br/>\nToontown is more of a cooperative game.  Again, reading is strengthened,<br/>\nand the phrases you can use to communicate are limited and therefore it<br/>\nis a safe online environment, yet very, very fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie (momx12), I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your mom.
