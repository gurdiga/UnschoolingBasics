I know mine was. We had the meanest mother in the whole<br/>\nworld! While other kids ate candy for breakfast, we had to have cereal,<br/>\neggs, and toast. When others had a Pepsi and a Twinkie for lunch, we had to<br/>\neat sandwiches. And you can guess our mother fixed us a dinner that was<br/>\ndifferent from what other kids had, too. Mother insisted on knowing where<br/>\nwe were at all times! . You&#39;d think we were convicts in a prison. She had<br/>\nto know who our friends were, and what we were doing with them. She<br/>\ninsisted that if we said we would be gone for an hour, we would be gone for<br/>\nan hour or less. We were ashamed to admit it, but she had the nerve to<br/>\nbreak the Child Labor Laws by making us work. We had to wash the dishes,<br/>\nmake the beds, learn to cook, vacuum the floor, do laundry, empty the trash<br/>\nand all sorts of cruel jobs. I think she would lie awake at night thinking<br/>\nof more things for us to do. She always insisted on us telling the truth,<br/>\nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth. By the time we were teenagers,<br/>\nshe could read our minds and had eyes in the back of her head. Then, life<br/>\nwas really tough!<br/>\nMother wouldn&#39;t let our friends just honk the horn when they drove up. They<br/>\nhad to come up to the door so she could meet them. While everyone else<br/>\ncould date when they were 12 or 13, we had to wait until we were 16.<br/>\nBecause of our mother we missed out on lots of things other kids<br/>\nexperienced. None of us have ever been caught shoplifting, vandalizing<br/>\nother&#39;s property or ever arrested for any crime. It was all her fault. Now<br/>\nthat we have left home, we are all educated, honest adults. We are doing<br/>\nour best to be mean parents just like Mom was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8877,"nextTopicId":8892}}
