I didn&#39;t list a single book.  We did list possible museum visits, but everything else was <br/>\nvery general.  My advice, don&#39;t worry so much about specifics, we used the unit study <br/>\naproach(they show an example in the packet).  Good luck.  Also if you use general terms, and <br/>\nthe phrase &quot;may include, but will not be limited to..&quot; then you cover a lot.
