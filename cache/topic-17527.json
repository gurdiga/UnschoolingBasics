I&#39;ve found <br/>\nthat its not usually about people &quot;not getting it&quot;, its about them not wanting <br/>\nto get it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts hard to deal with one&#39;s family.  I would address their cruelty and gently <br/>\nlet your in-laws know that what they did is not acceptable.  Ever.  Name <br/>\ncalling (lazy?) is way out of line. Maybe you could have helped Grandma with the <br/>\nchair and set your daughter free before the attack began?  If you want to <br/>\ncontinue to have a relationship with these people who mistreated your child (and <br/>\nyou), it might be a good idea to go over some options on how they can <br/>\nappropriately handle their anger.  &quot;Beat some respect into&quot; your children?  That&#39;s <br/>\nbeautifully worded.  Sometimes it helps just to repeat the exact same words back to <br/>\nthem.  &quot;If you don&#39;t stop belittling and screaming at my child, I&#39;m going to <br/>\nbeat some respect into you!&quot;  One really effective thing I&#39;ve used (got it <br/>\nfrom this list) is that if you wouldn&#39;t treat your spouse or another adult in a <br/>\ncertain way, it is not acceptable to do it to a child.  Saying those words <br/>\nusually gets them (cruel adults, that is) thinking.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my in laws ever tried to punish my kids for not obeying orders by not <br/>\nallowing them a turn on a tractor, I&#39;d let *everyone* know how wrong that is and <br/>\nwould request &quot;my turn&quot; and take everyone for a ride.  If dear grandpy had a <br/>\nproblem with that, he&#39;d have to admit that he wanted to punish me.  Then, look <br/>\nout!   We&#39;d be out of there, after we toured the town on the tractor, that is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are cruel people.  Family or not.  I&#39;m sorry for your poor husband.  He <br/>\nhad to grow up with that and probably learned to suck it up and obey.  How <br/>\nmiserable.  Your daughter is blessed to have you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWishing you all the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin in MA, who learned the hard way that we must always defend our precious <br/>\nchildren from mean, miserable people.  Regardless of who they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17521,"nextTopicId":17535}}
