One of my kids learned to read fluently at 3  <br/>\nyears old and another at 8 years old. A 17 yo unschooler I know well  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t learn to read until he was 12 or 13. It is to be expected. My  <br/>\nsuggestion to you is to stop comparing your kid to other kids - look  <br/>\nONLY at your own kid and notice what he IS doing, not what he isn&#39;t  <br/>\ndoing. You never help a kid by focusing on what he doesn&#39;t know - you  <br/>\nhelp them by supporting what they ARE doing, what they enjoy, what  <br/>\nthey are passionately pursuing. This is where trust is required for  <br/>\nunschooling parents - you have to be totally okay with kids learning  <br/>\non their own timetable. You have to be so sure that the WILL learn  <br/>\nwhat they need to learn that you simply stop worrying about it - you  <br/>\nlive each hour of each day enjoying what your kids are doing, not  <br/>\nfeeling concerned about what they aren&#39;t doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - please be careful about words like &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always.&quot; I bet  <br/>\nthat at least a few times your 4 1/2 year old HAS been interested in  <br/>\nletters or words. And if you think in absolute terms, you&#39;ll miss  <br/>\nthose moments when he IS interested, because they&#39;ll seem small and  <br/>\ninsignificant to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting is about having something to say. The BEST road to writing is  <br/>\nlots and lots of great experiences, lots of discussion, lots of  <br/>\npretend play, lots of stories and tv and movies and games and,  <br/>\neventually, a reason to want to write something down. Every time he  <br/>\ntells you about a game he is playing or about the lego creation and  <br/>\njust made, or about what he did at his friend&#39;s house, or anything  <br/>\nelse, THAT is him practicing &quot;writing.&quot; Later, he&#39;ll learn to get it  <br/>\non paper if there is reason for it, but that is just a technicality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are worrying about the mechanics of writing letters - please  <br/>\ndon&#39;t. ANY activity that involves him using his arms, hands, and  <br/>\nfingers, is helping him develop the muscles he&#39;ll eventually use in  <br/>\nwriting. He doesn&#39;t need to actually BE writing to develop those  <br/>\nsmall muscles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is GREAT danger in too-early academics. I&#39;ve seen it - I&#39;ve  <br/>\nwatched schools and homeschool parents doing academics with young  <br/>\nchildren and watched the children develop supposed learning  <br/>\ndisabilities. I am firmly convinced that those disabilities would  <br/>\nnever have arisen if the children were allowed to play and learn at  <br/>\ntheir own speed. Don&#39;t feel pangs of worry that your child is behind  <br/>\nother young children who appear to be doing academics - feel SORRY  <br/>\nfor those families because they are very likely to be facing a number  <br/>\nof possible problems that result FROM pushing the early academics.  <br/>\nEven if they manage to not create learning disabilities, there lots  <br/>\nof other negative consequences possible. Please read &quot;Miseducation:  <br/>\nPreschoolers at Risk&quot; by David Elkind. His ideas and evidence is  <br/>\napplied to kids 5 and under - but I truly believe that his arguments  <br/>\nare equally true for older kids, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Anyway our 4.5 year old has never been interested in writing<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":174410770,"authorName":"D Smith","from":"D Smith &lt;sandshuse@...&gt;","profile":"sandshuse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Learning To Write","postDate":"1162321443","msgId":18703,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYxMDMxMTkwNDAzLjkyMjI0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyOTAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVpNW8wNStsdDY2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":18702,"nextInTopic":18705,"prevInTime":18702,"nextInTime":18704,"topicId":18694,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"How does writing happen naturally?

The main thing here is when he has a personal need/want to write something down, he&#39;ll find the way.  He just recently started to LOVE to color.  ~Our house is plastered with halloween coloring pages~ So we&#39;ve been buying coloring books at every trip to town by his request.  He also loves to draw.  So without me trying to force him to write he&#39;s definitely strengthening those hand skills by coloring and drawing, which is his own way.  My other 2 sons writing skills came by the same force.  I also never force them to write in cursive, but my 12 yr old son the other day was asked to &quot;sign&quot; his name on his hunting license, so he now wants to learn to write in cursive.

(My DD&#39;s are 6 and 9). At the beginning of <br/>\nlast year I decided enough was enough (rolling eyes at myself) and <br/>\nthey were going to get the basics down! I printed worksheets, bought <br/>\nthose little laminate cards and books, made alphabet flash cards and <br/>\nspelling lists, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda.  We sat down <br/>\nevery morning, practice practice practice makes perfect y&#39;know <br/>\n(again rolling eyes at myself.)  We struggled, and fought, and cried <br/>\neveryday for 2 months.  My youngest still didn&#39;t know her alphabet <br/>\nand neither childs handwriting was where it *should* be.  Finally, I <br/>\ncame to my senses and let it go.  About a week later my youngest <br/>\npicked up the phone book and a notebook and started writing.  That <br/>\nis the event that turned the tables for me.  My then 5 year old <br/>\nteaching HERSELF to write from the phonebook.  Neither of my kids <br/>\nare probably as proficient in writing as their schooled <br/>\ncounterparts.  Who cares.  I have no doubt it will get better <br/>\nbecause now they write what interests them.  It might be my &quot;order&quot; <br/>\nwhen playing restaurant.  It might be my name when they are making <br/>\nme a card.  It might be some unknown language that only they know <br/>\nthe code to.  But they write, everyday!

But that is <br/>\nanother story for another day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know this didn&#39;t actually happen as naturally as you want it to <br/>\nfor your son.  But it will happen.  He&#39;ll come to you one day and <br/>\nask how to write *A* or he&#39;ll pick up a phone book and figure it out <br/>\nfor himself.

I&#39;m just wondering from others who have watched <br/>\nthis happen firsthand how it happens without sitting down and &quot;teaching&quot; them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just finished reading the article titled &#39;Jesse&#39;s Story&#39; by Sue Whitson in the new issue of <br/>\nLive Free Learn Free, and I think already it has put a lot of my fears to rest, and I conclude <br/>\nthat when he has a need/want to write then he will learn to write or ask his dad & I for <br/>\nhelp?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the other thing that brought it to my attention was that my mother-in-law just gave <br/>\nhim a pre-school workbook and in there they had some kind of &quot;writing&quot; exercises where <br/>\nyou trace along the straight/diagonal lines to, I assume, get a feeling for writing.  Damek <br/>\nseemed like he was having fun doing the dot to dots in the book and the mazes, but he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to color, so he said he wanted to skip the coloring pages, and then when he <br/>\ncame to these, he asked me what the dotted lines were for, and I told & showed him how <br/>\nyou trace them, and he just started drawing circles around the dotted lines saying &quot;I do it <br/>\nlike this&quot;, and he had fun doing it his own way.  Thank goodness it was me sitting down <br/>\nwith him rather than his Oma who gave him the book, because I&#39;m sure she would have <br/>\npromptly corrected him by saying &quot;no, you are supposed to do it this way&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate some more insight on this,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18666,"nextTopicId":18704}}
