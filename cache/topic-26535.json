We displayed many on bookshelves and a big wooden<br/>\ntrunk in our dining room.

His first day officially out of school, I <br/>\ngot a knock on the door while he was playing outside. He came bursting <br/>\nin saying something pretty much incomprehensible about a woman being <br/>\noutside. He looked terrified.<br/>\n<br/>\nI opened the door, and a well dressed woman was standing on my front <br/>\nporch and she said &quot;I know boys will be boys, but your son threw a soda <br/>\ncan out in the street and nearly hit my car, I wanted to let someone <br/>\nknow, because he could have seriously hurt someone.&quot; Looking in the <br/>\nstreet I saw at least five soda cans lying there. I thanked the woman <br/>\nfor letting me know, then promptly asked Caleb what he was doing. He <br/>\nsaid he wanted to see what would happen to a full can of Dr. Topper (a <br/>\ngeneric brand of Dr. Pepper like soda) when it exploded. Rather than <br/>\ngetting upset, I decided to make a point about learning things. I did <br/>\nmake him help me pick up the cans and put them in the recycle bin, then <br/>\ntook him inside and sat him down to explain what could have been the <br/>\nconsequences of his actions (causing a serious accident, us getting <br/>\nsued, possibly losing the house, having charges filed etc.).  I told him <br/>\nI wasn&#39;t going to do anything at that time, but now that he knew what <br/>\ncould have happened due to his &quot;experiment&quot;, I expected him to know that <br/>\nit was wrong and not to do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me the evening thinking about it, but the next morning I went in <br/>\nhis room, and told him I wanted to make a deal with him. I said I <br/>\nguaranteed that I would not get upset at any time with him if he wanted <br/>\nto do something just to see what it would do, if he would come to me <br/>\nfirst so I could make sure it is done safely, and without putting <br/>\nanyone, or anyone&#39;s property in danger. To make my point, I asked him <br/>\nwhat it was about seeing soda cans explode that interested him. He said <br/>\nhe just wanted to see what would happen. Then he got excited at the <br/>\nprospect of doing this without the possibility of getting in trouble, so <br/>\nhe said he would also like to see what happened when you put Mentos in Coke.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat day, we walked down to the gas station down the street, bought a 2 <br/>\nliter of diet Coke, and a pack of Mentos, and came back home. We also <br/>\nbought a 12 pack of Dr. Toppers as well. I also went in and got a pack <br/>\nof baking soda and some vinegar, and as many small empty plastic <br/>\ndrinking bottles as I could find. My daughter (25) got involved too, and <br/>\nwe all went out back and had a wonderful time trying out different <br/>\nthings with Mento&#39;s, Coke, vinegar, baking soda and topped it all off by <br/>\ntrying to see the best way of making Dr. Topper&#39;s explode!

This would help to relocate them in a couple of areas instead <br/>\nof all around the house, would showcase his work, and even help to feel <br/>\nlike he has a gallery of sorts. This would probably make it seem like he <br/>\nwas getting something rather than losing it. Is your hubby good with <br/>\ntools/woodworking? If so maybe he could get help from your son in <br/>\ndesigning and building the shelves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an artist myself, having a place to display my art is highly <br/>\nsatisfying and rewarding.  Maybe having the same kind of display would <br/>\nvalidate your son&#39;s artistry as well!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I need some help thinking this through!

My mind is stuck and <br/>\nstruggling to see clearly the situation I created with my child.  I <br/>\nam hoping that maybe you can see some creative ways to find peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS is 7 and an only.  We have been unschooling for about a year and <br/>\nit has improved so many things in our lives it&#39;s amazing!  We have a <br/>\nfairly small and very open single story house; there are not a lot of <br/>\noptions for finding private or personal space.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS loves Legos and very literally is taking over the entire house.  <br/>\nThere are Lego creations in every room of our house except the <br/>\nlaundry room (which is actually just a hallway).  He has a fantastic <br/>\nimagination and creates huge complexes of interrelated elements.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s quite impressive and I love what he does!  BUT, there are so <br/>\nmany of them that they are no longer enjoyable to us, the parents.  <br/>\nSome of these creations have been in their current location for <br/>\nalmost a year.  DS does not want to disassemble what he has made, <br/>\neven though we have taken lots of pictures of them and created a <br/>\npicture file of which he is very proud.<br/>\n<br/>\nDS wants more Legos.  I created a bigger problem by trying to <br/>\nmanipulate with a reward (which I get now, but not originally), I <br/>\ntold DS that I would buy his desired Lego set for him IF he would <br/>\nremove all his Legos from the master bedroom, bathroom, office, <br/>\nkitchen, floors, and from the hallways.  This leaves Legos in the  <br/>\nliving room, dining room, his room, and part of the family room, <br/>\nstill a very considerable area in our small house.  DS is very angry <br/>\nthat we are &quot;trying to make&quot; him take apart his creations.  He <br/>\ncorrectly sees my offer as manipulative and self serving.  He has the <br/>\nmoney to buy the set for himself, but that does not resolve the issue <br/>\nof space.  I screwed up when I tried to make reclaiming my own space <br/>\na reward situation.  I need better ideas on how to respectfully and <br/>\nhonorably work this through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep trying to think about what I would say or do if it was my DH&#39;s <br/>\nstuff that was taking over the house -- I don&#39;t think I would say or <br/>\ndo it differently, except that DH would not need me to help him &quot;get&quot; <br/>\nthe things (driving).  It&#39;s a problem regardless of whose stuff it <br/>\nis. <br/>\n<br/>\nBring on the ideas!!<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26520,"nextTopicId":26566}}
