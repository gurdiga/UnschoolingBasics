Dh&#39;s sis and her<br/>\nhubby are the guardians of our children in case anything should<br/>\nhappen to us.  We know for sure they would not homeschool the kids,<br/>\nbut that was not our major criteria for picking a guardian. I am not<br/>\nsure if I were a single mom (by choice or dh&#39;s demise) either I would<br/>\nmanage to homeschool.  I am an RN (here in Canada, so basically no<br/>\nflexability in schedules like working just weekends or anything) and<br/>\nit&#39;s definitely not a work from home career or anything, so at this<br/>\ntime if something happened I just cannot see any way I could manage<br/>\nto keep the kids home and unschool either.  We have limited<br/>\nbabysitting (I have a half time job, dh has no guarenteed hours in<br/>\nhis right now but works around me as much as possible) and only need<br/>\n4-5 days a month tops, but I know they are not willing to do more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI unschool because of the way my children and very definitely the way<br/>\nmy dd learns...very kinesthetic/language oriented, cannot sit still,<br/>\netc.  She very much fits the profile of a highly sensitive kid, I am<br/>\nsure she would suffer in school.  I just see her blossoming so much<br/>\nat home, and how she learns best at her own terms.  I know this is<br/>\nthe right way for us to learn, just through life.  However, doing my<br/>\nwill has brought up a number of thoughts....I know my kids are WHO<br/>\nTHEY ARE, they can only be compared to themselves, etc.  I just have<br/>\nthis niggling thought in the back of my mind that both of them would<br/>\nbe majorly &quot;behind&quot; if ever put in a school setting (well, ds is not<br/>\nschool age, but definitely has motor/speech issues that I am debating<br/>\ngetting evaluated because of more and more problems they are causing<br/>\nin everyday situations)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are enjoying their real lives RIGHT NOW, growing everyday, which<br/>\nis what is important.  I would not change my unschooling to school at<br/>\nhome just because of a remote possibility that something would happen<br/>\nto one or both of us, but I have been somewhat haunted by thoughts of<br/>\nmy kids struggling in school especially when I think of where dd is<br/>\nrelated to a typical scope and sequence...sort of &quot;proof&quot; to my<br/>\nfamily/SIL that unschooling doesn;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs dh says, I/we wouldn&#39;t be around after our deaths to worry about<br/>\nit now wouldn&#39;t we?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts from anyone on all this?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOur wills state who will take our boys. Cameron is now 19, so we did a <br/>\nnew one right after his 18th birthday so that *he* would be the legal <br/>\nguardian of Duncan (11). Up until then, we&#39;d picked out friends who <br/>\nunderstand unschooling. She was Cameron&#39;s third grade teacher and is <br/>\nnow the head of a schoool for kids with learning differences. When we <br/>\ndecided to pull Cam out of school, she&#39;s the one who suggested I read <br/>\nHolt. &lt;g&gt; Her husband is a sociology professor at the university. Our <br/>\nlife insurance $$ would&#39;ve covered one&#39;s salary so that one could stay <br/>\nhome with the boys and continue to unschool. Period. All understood and <br/>\nin writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe couldn&#39;t have left them with family---the boys would&#39;ve been back in <br/>\nschool before you could say John Holt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt certainly gets easier as they get older. I know *I* breathe more <br/>\neasily!<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it depends on what&#39;s more important to you. Unschooling and <br/>\nmindful parenting were more important to me and Ben than the idea that <br/>\nthey would be with family. Still so. If Ben and Cam and I all die, Dunc <br/>\nstill goes to Pat & Gillian.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve offered before and have been taken up on the offer once so far: <br/>\nBen and I are happy to be the guardians of any unschooled child. We all <br/>\ndoubt it will ever happen, but the peace of mind of knowing that the <br/>\nlifestyle would be maintained is immeasurable. You would have to put it <br/>\nin your wills though---and I think it would be a good idea to know us. <br/>\n&lt;bwg&gt; Come visit. &lt;g&gt; But we&#39;re as serious as we can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
