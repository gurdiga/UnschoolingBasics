The National Education Association, which is adamantly<br/>\nagainst homeschooling in any form, is pushing for a national<br/>\ncurriculum which would infringe on our freedom to allow our child to<br/>\nlearn in the ways that are best for him. Do you support a national<br/>\ncurriculum or the NEA&#39;s assessment of homeschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nLast I checked the question is currently #249 under the &quot;topics&quot; button.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29013,"nextTopicId":28964}}
