The author is a dyslexic and a very interesting<br/>\nperson.  He has a program that he designed for helping with the process of<br/>\nlearning to read.  Basically it replaces the highly verbal and symbolic<br/>\ninstruction with tactile ideas using 3D things like working with clay.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s still way too schooly.  If you&#39;re looking to show that school<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work though, it gives some good arguements for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9/6/08, Nicole Willoughby &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cncnawilloughby@...\">cncnawilloughby@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   public school intervention is doing nothing to help .... esp on dyslexia<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; or that dyslexic / other reading problems left to themselves will &quot;catch up<br/>\n&gt; &quot; on their own<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anything like that would be very helpful.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks,<br/>\n&gt; nicole<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Needing articles on learning disabilities that show","postDate":"1220748237","msgId":35739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwOTIxOS45MDk5MS5xbUB3ZWIzMTkxMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35741,"prevInTime":35738,"nextInTime":35740,"topicId":35739,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"public school intervention is doing nothing to help .... esp on dyslexia or that dyslexic / other reading problems left to themselves will catch up  on their","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-144268695\">public school intervention is doing nothing to help .... esp on dyslexia <br/>\n<br/>\nor that dyslexic / other reading problems left to themselves will &quot;catch up &quot; on their own<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything like that would be very helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nnicole <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35724,"nextTopicId":35769}}
