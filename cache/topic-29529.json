My DS is 9 1/2 and he&#39;ll still get in my face (or DH&#39;s)<br/>\nsometimes. Particularly irritating behaviors include repeatedly bumping<br/>\nus, poking, making loud gibberish sounds directly in our faces,<br/>\ndeliberately moving in front of us as we&#39;re trying to go from place to<br/>\nplace (including physically blocking the way by holding onto<br/>\ndoorframes), etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve uncovered several &quot;triggers&quot; to this type stuff:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- lack of food, specifically protein, make impulse control harder for<br/>\nhim - he told us flat out when he was about 5 &quot;my brain won&#39;t let me<br/>\nstop&quot; even though he knew what he was doing was irritating and we had<br/>\nasked him to stop. So, we make sure he gets protein regularly throughout<br/>\nthe day, snackwise<br/>\n2- tiredness sometimes because his motor is revving too fast, finding<br/>\nsome way (picking a movie, TV program, story, relaxed type board game)<br/>\nto slow down and catch up to himself helps<br/>\n3 - feeling rushed or pressured about something causes him to dig in<br/>\n4 - needing focused attention - for instance, sometimes having me<br/>\nreading a magazine article nearby while he&#39;s watching a favorite TV show<br/>\nis fine. Other times, he needs me to be focusing on what he&#39;s focusing<br/>\non.<br/>\n5 - odd as this may sound compared to #3, not going quickly enough - as<br/>\nin, if we&#39;re leaving someplace (even a place he enjoys) those long chit<br/>\nchatty goodbyes (see you soon, had a nice time, send me the recipe,<br/>\nyaddayadda) are out - once we say Time to go, we&#39;re out of there as<br/>\nquickly as possible. DH and I have had to learn to do all our winding<br/>\ndown stuff at social events BEFORE we get jackets on - once his jacket<br/>\nis on, it&#39;s time to head out the door<br/>\n6 - having to &quot;contain&quot; himself in some situations means that he&#39;s<br/>\nlikely to have trouble after a bit of time (30 minutes to an hour<br/>\ndepending on circumstance) as bits of &quot;energy&quot; start popping out. For<br/>\ninstance, he can manage about 30 minutes visiting FIL in the hospital<br/>\nbut that&#39;s about it (and he&#39;s got a bag stuffed with his DS & games,<br/>\nsketchpad and writing stuff, snacks, water bottle, assorted other items<br/>\nas he requests so it&#39;s not just nothing to do but sit). Hospitals are<br/>\nplaces where quieter, restrained behavior is needed (no running,<br/>\njumping, yelling, etc) plus they tend to have bright lights, odd smells<br/>\nand sounds, and a generally stressful atmosphere. All that plays into<br/>\nthe situation. He&#39;s fine playing with something we&#39;ve brought along for<br/>\nup to 30 minutes. After that, we (DS and I) generally try to take a walk<br/>\nor do something away from FIL&#39;s room (FIL is a bit of a depressing<br/>\nperson to be around anyhow and DS doesn&#39;t have a super strong feeling of<br/>\nconnection with him to start with). After about 30 minutes of doing<br/>\nsomething else, we&#39;ll head back and let DH know it&#39;s time to leave and<br/>\noff we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts to maybe jump start some things going in your mind as<br/>\nto where stuff is coming from and what kinds of stuff might help. It may<br/>\nbe, at first glance, that he&#39;s just feeling a bit left out of his<br/>\nsister&#39;s day - perhaps she&#39;s moved from a &quot;peer&quot; type playmate to being<br/>\na little older and having other interests more now (a natural<br/>\nprogression) and he&#39;s not getting as much of her attention as he used to<br/>\nget. Working together to figure out how to give her her space and at the<br/>\nsame time &quot;fill his cup&quot; where it needs her attention is a discussion<br/>\npoint. And, perhaps, (just guessing) if she was his usual playmate but<br/>\nisn&#39;t as interested anymore, you (mom) will need to take up some of the<br/>\nslack and/or find other venues for him to develop new ways of getting<br/>\nthat (even though it&#39;s not the same as his sister, it might help).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
