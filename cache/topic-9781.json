There was a time <br/>\nwhen I was extremely frustrated with my kids leaving their trash <br/>\nwherever they were, they just dropped it where they were sitting.  And <br/>\nthe clothes, wherever they took it off that is where it stayed.  I <br/>\nremember calling Ren and venting my frustration.  She said &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>\nyou just make it really easy for them by putting little trash cans in <br/>\nthe areas where they seem to drop their trash.&quot;  Duh!!!  It seemed to <br/>\nsimple but I couldn&#39;t get past the tools I was given as a child.  <br/>\nSomehow my kids were lazy and uncaring when really they just had a <br/>\nhard time leaving what they were doing to throw something in the <br/>\ntrash.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9774,"nextTopicId":9729}}
