Here&#39;s <br/>\nour experience...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids weren&#39;t much interested in TV at first. They preferred to <br/>\nplay together...often for hours without fighting. I didn&#39;t turn the <br/>\nTV on myself, so they just didn&#39;t know much about it. I did play some <br/>\nvideos and DVDs for them that were kids shows in other languages (my <br/>\nkids are Korean and Chinese). They enjoyed them but usually preferred <br/>\nto go back to playing after seeing one instead of seeing another or <br/>\nthe same one over again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen one Summer, while on vacation, they discoverd PBSKids on TV and <br/>\nfell in love. They watched quite a bit of PBSKids, not exploring <br/>\nanything outside of that (on TV) for about a year. Since PBSKids (at <br/>\nleast in our area) stops kid programming at 6pm in the evenings, and <br/>\nhas very little weekend programming for kids, they couldn&#39;t watch <br/>\nendless hours of it. They often turned it off voluntarily during the <br/>\nday, too, when shows came on they weren&#39;t interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the following Summer we went to Panama and they found the <br/>\nDiscovery Kids channel...which, at least in Panama, showed PBSKids <br/>\nand Noggin shows. Most of the shows were in English (with Spanish <br/>\nsubtitles), so they were able to learn about new shows that they <br/>\nassumed they would be able to see at home. When we returned home, <br/>\nthey asked about a few shows they had seen and we found them on <br/>\nNoggin. Noggin shortly became my daughter&#39;s almost constant <br/>\ncompanion. My son watched it some, too, but preferred DVDs. I tried <br/>\nletting my daughter regulate her own TV viewing, even when I felt it <br/>\nwas excessive, without my input (I said nothing about how I felt). My <br/>\nson&#39;s movie viewing went up and down. He played more than viewed. <br/>\nThen he found Sponge Bob. (Ugh.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about a year of this, with the TV viewing getting heavier and <br/>\nheavier, and the behavior getting worse and worse (screaming and <br/>\ncrying fits when the TV got turned off when we left the house, etc.), <br/>\nI decided to try a different approach. I asked my kids what their <br/>\nfavorite shows were. We looked at the schedule to see what time they <br/>\ncame on, and we turned off the TV when one of these shows wasn&#39;t on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe result has been MUCH more pretend play, MUCH more playing <br/>\ntogether (with WAY LESS fighting), and they turn off the TVs <br/>\nvoluntarily now in order to play. No complaining, no crying fits, no <br/>\nscreaming. There is peace. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is our experience. I think you just have to feel out <br/>\nwhat works for your family. Try different things, and also try to get <br/>\nyour kids&#39; input about the situation. &quot;Laying down the law&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>\nappear to be very successful, in my opinion. I also try to include my <br/>\nkids in decisions about their lives, and I always give them options <br/>\nand ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nChelsea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My kids want to play video games and watch tv all day!","postDate":"1228775956","msgId":37190,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdoazdtaytha3RxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVkYTM3ZTg0MDgxMjA3MjMwNWs1ZTRlOTMxNm5hN2Y2N2U3MTkwYThiODlmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37189,"nextInTopic":37197,"prevInTime":37189,"nextInTime":37191,"topicId":37162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... exciting for ...

So, please, write on!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think the most important &quot;first step&quot; is to make a concious effort <br/>\nto spend part of every day watching and/or playing with them. Watch <br/>\nthem play video games the same way you would watch them play dress <br/>\nup, or build with legos - interact as much as they want (or stay out <br/>\nof the way as much as they want!) but soak up their fascination, <br/>\nenthusiasm and joy. Chit chat about the games, characters, difficult <br/>\nbits later on, too, the way you might about an interesting story you <br/>\nwere reading together. <br/>\n<br/>\nTv, too - although with tv there may be more opportunities to chat <br/>\nduring the show. With tv it helps to try to step away from your &quot;mom <br/>\nbrain&quot; a little while you&#39;re watching and respond to the shows the <br/>\nway you would if watching with a friend, as opposed to thinking &quot;is <br/>\nthis okay for kids? am I okay with them watching it?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf part of your concern is that they aren&#39;t getting enough exercise, <br/>\nfind ways for them to be active while watching/playing. Mini <br/>\ntrampoline, exercise ball, roller blades, tread mill... anything you <br/>\ncan think of that will fit in your home! If you can afford it, look <br/>\nfor hand-held versions of games that they can take outside to play <br/>\nwhen the weather is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBring your own projects into the same room as the tv. Hang out <br/>\ntogether, each doing your own thing. They may get interested in what <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing or not - but they are far more likely to be interested <br/>\nthan if you&#39;re off in another part of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways to bring the characters and themes of their favorite <br/>\nshows/games into other aspects of life. For example, Mo likes to wear <br/>\nher hair the way some of the girls in pokemom shows do - either with <br/>\nthe bangs hanging over her eyes or two big pony tails. Okay, normal <br/>\nlittle girl hair styles, but to *her* its &quot;Pokemon trainer hair&quot; and <br/>\nthat&#39;s what&#39;s important. She has a blue striped sweater that we call <br/>\nher &quot;Blues Clues&quot; sweater, even though its *just* a blue striped <br/>\nsweater, not something marketed for the show. She has special jumps <br/>\non the trampoline that are inspired by the show and game &quot;Avatar&quot;. <br/>\nThe important thing is to celebrate what interests your kids, however <br/>\nyou can!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are wanting to do other things, make a wish list. Make <br/>\nsome plans. Recently my kids were complaining that George wasn&#39;t <br/>\nspending enough time with them - they&#39;re so independent that he had <br/>\nfallen into the habit of getting sucked in to his own projects. So I <br/>\ntalked with the kids and with George and came up with some ideas. I <br/>\ndug out some old books, pulled out some boxes of stuff from storage <br/>\nand did a little extra strewing. I sent out a plea to the <br/>\ngrandparents to send xmas presents a little sooner if they were <br/>\nproject sorts of things (grandma sent a volcano kit...oooooohhhhh, <br/>\nahhhhhhh!). I did some extra cleaning, which always helps motivate <br/>\npeople in my family.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce again, this is when its important to bring projects To the kids -<br/>\n into the same room, anyway. For example, George will set up paints <br/>\nand just start painting for his own enjoyment. Mo often comes and <br/>\njoins him, but he doesn&#39;t coax her. He just makes sure she knows its <br/>\nhappening. He might also go set up the trains just for kicks - he&#39;s a <br/>\nlongtime train fan, and even though these are pretty low-key trains, <br/>\nhe likes to play with them now and again. This past week he and Mo <br/>\nhave been talking about &quot;train furniture&quot; - making houses and bridges <br/>\nand tunnels for the trains. The important thing to keep in mind with <br/>\nall this is the idea *isn&#39;t* to lure kids away from the tv or video <br/>\ngames. The idea is to lay out options without any pressure (a kind of <br/>\nstrewing) so your kids are making real choices, not just defaulting <br/>\nto the most obvious, simplest thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My kids want to play video games and watch tv all day!","postDate":"1228774432","msgId":37189,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdoazY3MCtlb3NxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExZmRkNTEwMDgxMjA4MTIyMGczZjA3NjYxOG44NDEyOTRmZjllMzY5NTViQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37188,"nextInTopic":37190,"prevInTime":37188,"nextInTime":37190,"topicId":37162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... like the ... bros brawl.
