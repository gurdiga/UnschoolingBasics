Ray hasn&#39;t the least bit of interest in a Spongebob game, and Mo&#39;s not terribly interested in God of War.

Is there an older sibling or parent who enjoys that game? That&#39;s a common reason.

Children, by nature, experiment as a way to learn about the world. Sometimes this experimentation is taken to mean they &quot;don&#39;t understand the difference&quot; between reality and fantasy. Its just as realistic to say that kind of experimentation is part of *how* they understand that difference. The difference between video game &quot;physics&quot; and real physics becomes apparent very quickly. The difference between a dead enemy in a game and, say, roadkill, is also obvious. The difference between the trash talk in a video game and saying something like that to a parent or sibling is something it can take longer to explore, because people react in a variety of different ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"gruvystarchild","from":"&quot;gruvystarchild&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: new online support group for parents against violent play","postDate":"1262998697","msgId":42817,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhpOGtiOSthYmxwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDYxODc5LjQ3MDkyLnFtQHdlYjY1NzEzLm1haWwuYWM0LnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":42815,"nextInTopic":42821,"prevInTime":42816,"nextInTime":42818,"topicId":42807,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~And I don t think there s any need to go out of your way to introduce violent games to very young children. ~~ When you have older children it s pretty hard","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1285240170\">~~And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any need<br/>\nto go out of your way to introduce violent games to very young children. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have older children it&#39;s pretty hard to keep it from the young ones.

It feels exactly like what it is:<br/>\ncontrol, force. It feels like &quot;I don&#39;t care about you and what you want.<br/>\nI only care that you conform to what makes me comfortable.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how sincerely loving your intentions, they *can&#39;t* be felt<br/>\nthat way through power. The intent means nothing. The actions are saying<br/>\nthe opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is reaction to fear. While it makes sense that violent play will<br/>\nyield violent acts, there&#39;s absolutely no evidence for that. (The<br/>\nstudies are flawed.)  There is, in fact, counter evidence right among<br/>\n100s of our own kids, that when kids are allowed to freely pursue their<br/>\ninterests, including violent video games, that they become quite the<br/>\nopposite of violent. (Maybe pretend violence helps center them even more<br/>\nby letting them play in a world where they can see violence begets<br/>\nviolence and it&#39;s not a loving world. It&#39;s fun to play in a world where<br/>\nthe rules are different but it&#39;s comforting to know they can shut it off<br/>\nand not have to live there.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone here is thinking about controlling their children&#39;s video<br/>\ngames, do get yourself to an unschooling conference and see the older<br/>\nchildren of long time unschoolers. You&#39;d really never meet a kinder more<br/>\nthoughtful group of kids.
