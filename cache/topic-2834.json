She started feeling antsy around <br/>\n16-17 years old and felt a need for like-minded friends. She was so <br/>\ninto computers, that the solution eventually presented itself when <br/>\nshe started a BBS. Within a few months, the computer geeks in our <br/>\narea knew who she was and she had more friends with same interests <br/>\nthan we could accomodate at times. She had found her niche. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Jon&#39;s niche? What is his passion? Could you help him find an <br/>\nactivity where his passion is the main focus and kids his age are <br/>\ninvolved? <br/>\n<br/>\nTeen angst is a rite of passage and he&#39;ll get through it easier than <br/>\nschooled kids because he has your support, encouragement and <br/>\nconcern. Sometimes it&#39;ll seem like it&#39;s lasting forever, but he will <br/>\nget through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nlove, Valerie<br/>\nwww.ubpub.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141910957,"authorName":"Valerie","from":"&quot;Valerie&quot; &lt;valerie@...&gt;","profile":"valfitz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"cursive writing","postDate":"1092839348","msgId":2839,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmdnAzays4cmthQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyMjAzLTQxMjM1MDIyLTE4M0BzdG9yZWZ1bGwtMzE1Ni5iYXkud2VidHYubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":2834,"nextInTopic":2840,"prevInTime":2838,"nextInTime":2840,"topicId":2834,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One thing that really upsets him is he feels he cannot write.

Every<br/>\ntime school starts they think of going back and I get upset. One of the<br/>\nmajor reasons they want to go back this year is to find &quot;girls.&quot; :) We<br/>\njust opened a holistic shop just across from our local highschool. My 16<br/>\nsays he doesn&#39;t feel like he is learning enough. I think differently. We<br/>\nhave some family members who still believe the only learning is the<br/>\nformal way. My 16 year old - Jon - has dyslexia and was never &quot;properly&quot;<br/>\neducated in public school. One thing that really upsets him is he feels<br/>\nhe cannot write. He cannot read cursive writing. He writes all the time<br/>\nand is good at it. He sees it differently. I said, &quot;why not work with me<br/>\nat the shop, learn a bunch of stuff there, do what you have been doing,<br/>\netc. When highschool gets out, meander outside to &quot;hangout&quot; with whom<br/>\never you choose?&quot; He said, &quot;Oh yeah, I could do that.&quot; We go through<br/>\nthis every school year... I feel sad about it. I feel like maybe I am<br/>\nworking on denying him something he needs or could help him. He was so<br/>\nemotionally damaged from his school experience that as soon as he begins<br/>\nto think of school he trembles and gets anxious. He is on Lexapro. I<br/>\nwant what is best for my kids. I know he thinks that a girlfriend will<br/>\nsolve his problems. He liked one who unfortunately for her, has serious<br/>\nemotional problems. He said he felt in love with her. Then he said he<br/>\nknows it isn&#39;t her, but that he wants someone to &quot;be with.&quot; I know he is<br/>\nstruggling to love himself and I worry he thinks someone else can &quot;fix&quot;<br/>\nhim. This to me, is upsetting. He will be 17 in February. I don&#39;t want<br/>\nhim in public school. I don&#39;t want to deny him either.
