How is it helping anyone unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, to SCHOOL someone they&#39;d be required to be here. We&#39;d<br/>\nmake you read certain things, answer specific questions and give you<br/>\ngrades for not answering correctly. You&#39;d have no choice in the matter<br/>\nand your grade would be at our whim. Comparing an email list that has<br/>\na very specific purpose to SCHOOLING you is ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than whine about how a list is run, start one. <br/>\nI get really tired of people telling me HOW to volunteer my time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14950,"nextTopicId":15104}}
