My four kids<br/>\nhave always been unschooled and they are 11, 9, 6, and 4.  We have no doubts<br/>\nabout the value of unschooling, and no fears our kids aren&#39;t going to learn<br/>\nthrough unschooling.  They are insatiably curious, have never been pushed<br/>\ntoward anything but have had the freedom to follow their bliss.  We are all<br/>\ndrawn to nature and celebrating the seasons and were part of a<br/>\nnature-inspired group before we moved last month.  Through this group the<br/>\nkids encountered some Waldorf-inspired friends and we have blended in the<br/>\naspects they are interested in, while keeping to our unschooling life.  They<br/>\nlove to knit, for example, and make candles and apple sauce and explore the<br/>\nearth.  We are committed to having fun and enjoying each other.  We even<br/>\nhave a list of fun ways the kids have come up with to clean house together<br/>\n(when we feel like cleaning together).  Sometimes it looks like crazy people<br/>\nchasing each other through the house cackling, and sometimes we empty a<br/>\nroom, smudge it, and put back only the things we want to stay in that room.<br/>\nSometimes they create a store, with their toy cash register, and shoppers<br/>\nbring bags of &quot;room debris&quot; to buy at the checkout counter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe consider ourselves from Austin, but have spent the past 7-1/2 years in<br/>\nthe SF Bay Area and last month moved down to San Diego.  So, we&#39;re beginning<br/>\na new journey down here and enjoying the local unschooling group&#39;s beach<br/>\ndays.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to be here,<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.488 / Virus Database: 269.13.39/1044 - Release Date: 10/2/2007<br/>\n11:10 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
