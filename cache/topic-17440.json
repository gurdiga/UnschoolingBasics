How do you <br/>\napproach your husband with the principles of radical unschooling <br/>\nwhen we&#39;ve both been raised with traditional parenting, public <br/>\nschooling, etc.? We have homeschooled the past 3 years, but I just <br/>\nfound out about unschooling recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to the radical unschooling idea, but I&#39;ve been reading <br/>\neverything I can (I just got Rue&#39;s book today - YAY!) & have begun <br/>\nto implement some of the principles I&#39;m learning (like saying Yes <br/>\nmore, etc.) <br/>\n<br/>\nI cringe at the thought of how controlling we have been with our <br/>\nkids in the past! I&#39;m trying to correct that now, but I want to <br/>\ndiscuss this with my husband & share these new ideas with him & I <br/>\nwant to do so in a way that will not put him on the defensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband thinks if the kids don&#39;t finish their dinner, then they <br/>\nshould have no dessert. They should go to bed at a certain time. My <br/>\nson likes crazy hairstyles & had his hair spiked up in a mohawk <br/>\nyesterday. My husband thought he should fix his hair in a &quot;normal&quot; <br/>\nstyle before going out. I told hubby his hair was fine & if that&#39;s <br/>\nall we have to worry about we are lucky indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like for him to be on board with unschooling & mindful <br/>\nparenting. Has anyone dealt with this issue here & how did you <br/>\nhandle it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracy in AL</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17409,"nextTopicId":17368}}
