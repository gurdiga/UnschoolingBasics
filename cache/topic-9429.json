Sorry about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to add about &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;... some may be thinking of the<br/>\nHenry James story &quot;The Sense of the Past&quot; and I think the film was said<br/>\nto be based on that story or a play based on that story when it was<br/>\nreleased.   The connections to Lovecraft come from a letter he wrote a<br/>\nfriend after seeing the film and from his story &quot;The Case of Charles<br/>\nDexter Ward&quot; written in 1928. (?)   <br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, a lot of the movies are shamefully, loosely based on<br/>\nLovecraft stories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9425,"nextTopicId":9432}}
