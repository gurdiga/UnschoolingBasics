Please check our links section at this <br/>\nwebsite for resources and recommendations and learn more about <br/>\nunschooling if you think it&#39;s something you&#39;d like to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is to help people get closer to unschooling, to learn more <br/>\nabout unschooling and to discuss ways to help unschooling flow <br/>\nbetter in your home. Not how to school kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thought Latoya,<br/>\nYour pushing them to bed earlier might actually be causing some <br/>\nreally great learning moments. If the little one is in bed early, <br/>\nyou could spend more time with the older kids. Sometimes our very <br/>\nbest learning moments happen late at night around here! If I made <br/>\nthem go to bed, we&#39;d be missing some amazing moments, not to mention <br/>\nsome lovely nighttime walks when the world is peaceful and dark.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4842,"nextTopicId":4846}}
