Of course, more &quot;wild&quot; nature is also accessible  within a 2 hour drive (coast, mountains).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving moved from a really sunny (and COLD/SNOWY) place, I was worried we would really miss the sun...but have found that the sun shines at least a little almost every day...many days start out hazy and grey, but then have sun interspersed...I found it to be quite nice (but of course, have been told my many long time Oregonians I&#39;m in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period), but, so far, so good...the other reason I think the weather didn&#39;t bother me so much is that there&#39;s plenty of stuff to do, even if it&#39;s raining!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also considered Eugene, and on &quot;paper&quot; it seemed like the perfect fit for us -- we were worried that Portland would be too big and impersonal, but we are finding it to be more like a &quot;big town&quot; than a huge city...lots of friendly people, we see familiar faces most places we go, so that makes it seem smaller.  We spent two days in Eugene about 2 years ago when we were making our decision (granted that&#39;s not a lot of time, but...)and it seemed to be a city more based around the university...(again, this could have just been our impressions since we were there for such a short time) but we&#39;ve found we love the diversity in Portland.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go, but feel free to email me off list if you want more info...<br/>\nCarolyn with hubby Bret and daughters Sabine and Vivian<br/>\nwahoowinklers.blogspot.com (haven&#39;t updated in a bit since it&#39;s summer!)<br/>\ncgwinkler at gmail dot com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":369294489,"authorName":"Annora Guidry","from":"Annora Guidry &lt;ms_apg@...&gt;","profile":"ms_apg","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Searching for a different state.....
