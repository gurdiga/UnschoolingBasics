My  <br/>\ndaughter was like that when we started this road, but with a lot of  <br/>\nprompting, she got to the point where she would ask for just about  <br/>\nanything with one word. Then we moved on to that one word with &#39;more&#39;  <br/>\nor &#39;please&#39; When she was five, we got to the point where we could  <br/>\nhold up three fingers and say, &quot;Three words please&quot;. We&#39;d usually get  <br/>\n&#39;more crackers please&#39;. Now that she&#39;s eight, we usually prompt her  <br/>\nwith &#39;I need a sentence please&#39;, although on days that she is  <br/>\nstressed, we move back to holding up fingers and asking for a number  <br/>\nof words. She really is much happier, and I&#39;d say about a quarter of  <br/>\nthe time she will ask independently for something she really really  <br/>\nwants. Just keep labeling for now, and it&#39;ll happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe kept Breanna in school all through kindergarten. And TBH, it was a  <br/>\ngreat program up til first grade. She was joyful to be there, and the  <br/>\nkids really were great with her. But once academics got serious, she  <br/>\nwas miserable, the schools didn&#39;t know what to do with her, they  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know how to teach her, and basically they were stressing her  <br/>\nout.

By avoiding <br/>\ncertain carbohydrates and allowing foods the body can currently <br/>\ndigest well, you allow the gut to heal.  And eventually you can <br/>\ngradually reintroduce what might have been offending foods.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso from what I understand,  it&#39;s different from gluten-free in <br/>\nthta it avoids pretty much all grains, not just gluten, but does <br/>\nallow plenty of carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables.  (Hence <br/>\nthe name &quot;specific carbohydrate&quot;.)<br/>\nBut it seems you do not have to be on the diet for the rest of your <br/>\nlife, only enough time to allow the gut to heal.  Although some do <br/>\nchoose to stay on it for longer periods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems the diet has been successful for many people who suffer <br/>\nfrom IBS, Crohn&#39;s, celiac, even autistic kids, have benefitted.  <br/>\nThought it might be worth mentioning and looking at the info.

At the age of 2, knowing what I know now I wouldnt give him a single bite of wheat products untill he gets much older. <br/>\n  Maybe that sounds like over reacting but you cant ( or at least its really hard) undo damage that has already been done . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I know the diet can be a pain considering there is wheat in Everything but if its possible for you I suggest staying gluten free untill they are much older then doing a challenge and testing again.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  my 2 cents,<br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBrings words and photos together (easily) with<br/>\n PhotoMail  - it&#39;s free and works with Yahoo!
