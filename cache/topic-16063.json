Sounds interesting!**<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, the book title is _I Only Say This Because I Love You_, by Deborah<br/>\nTannen.  I found some quotable snippets with the search feature on Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor starters she says women generally are quick to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;,<br/>\nbut that men are less so.  It seems that women may equate saying &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry&quot; with thinking &quot;I sympathize&quot; but men feel that saying &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\nsorry&quot; means &quot;Yes, I am guilty; I am a terrible sinner; I abase<br/>\nmyself.&quot;  (This is my own rephrasing.)  Thus men tend to be much more<br/>\nreluctant to apologize; they feel they really lose a lot of status or<br/>\nface if they do apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of (truncated) quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For many of us (more women than men), apologies come in pairs and<br/>\nconstitute a ritual exchange: I apologize for x, then you apologize<br/>\nfor y, and we both consider the matter closed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...because most men don&#39;t recognize the ritual nature of women&#39;s<br/>\napologies and don&#39;t expect people to apologize when they don&#39;t have<br/>\nto. By the same token, women tend to overinterpret men&#39;s not apologizing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(About a husband who forgot to mail a letter -&gt;) &quot;No explanation. No<br/>\napology. She was furious-not because he had forgotten (though that<br/>\ncertainly irked her) but because he didn&#39;t apologize. &quot;If I had done<br/>\nthat,&quot; she told me, &quot;I would have fallen all over myself saying how<br/>\nsorry I was.&quot; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ironically, the more a woman demands an apology, the more a man may<br/>\nresiste complying because the demand in itself makes apologizing seem<br/>\nmore like a degradation ritual.  If she told him that something he did<br/>\nhad hurt or upset her he had armsful of talk he&#39;d unload: excuses,<br/>\ncounterattacks, deflecting the blame-anything but admitting he&#39;d made<br/>\na mistake and was sorry. Then his failure to apologize-from her point<br/>\nof view, to take responsibility for what he&#39;d done and express remorse<br/>\nat having hurt her-would continue to irritate rather than healed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe didn&#39;t say this, but because women in our culture have<br/>\ntraditionally had lower status than men, a behavior, apologizing, that<br/>\nis a bit like groveling or surrendering may be more comfortable for us<br/>\nthan for &quot;higher status&quot; men who may feel any admission of culpability<br/>\nis a dangerous admission of weakness.  An admission of weakness could<br/>\npotentially lead to a loss of status.  (Myself, I don&#39;t worry about my<br/>\nstatus much.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I off topic, or can we circle this back to unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nTreating our kids like &quot;real people&quot; and not like they have &quot;low<br/>\nstatus&quot; because they are young can, I think, make the transition to<br/>\nhaving strong adult-adult relationships easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Checking in","postDate":"1154553944","msgId":16161,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhcjU4bys2NjVxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16160,"nextInTopic":16183,"prevInTime":16160,"nextInTime":16162,"topicId":16063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I especially recommend the chapter dealing with likely differences ...

Now <br/>\nwe have to do this whole &quot;don&#39;t touch this&quot; &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot; and I <br/>\nknow it&#39;s hard for them.  We need to find our own place ASAP!!!  Of <br/>\ncourse, you know how it is when you&#39;re around family: you have a <br/>\ntendency to slide back into &quot;family roles&quot;, and I know I&#39;ve been <br/>\ndoing that way too much: becoming the insecure one, the one who&#39;s <br/>\nnot sure of what she&#39;s doing, the one who lets everyone else take <br/>\nthe lead.....and that&#39;s not the person I&#39;ve become (can anyone else <br/>\nrelate to the whole family roles thing??)

It&#39;s called The Soul of the Child by Michael Gurian.  <br/>\nI haven&#39;t finished it, but it&#39;s been a real eye opener.  I&#39;m also <br/>\nreading Siblings Without Rivalry, and boy!  Do I feel like a big <br/>\nboob!  LOL.  Especially with that whole &quot;family roles&quot; thing.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to do that to my children - yuck.  I&#39;m working really <br/>\nhard on not being so stressed out in this situation.
