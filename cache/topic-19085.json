I have a 6 year old with Asperger&#39;s.  It&#39;s a neurological disorder.  She is special needs.  Her world is much different than the world most of us live in.  She will and does hurt her 8 year old sister. Also my 6 year old flies into horrible rages, where she will kick doors and punch walls.......it&#39;s impossible to talk out any kind of solution when she is like this. When she is hurting her sister she has to be removed from the situation........period, end of story.  I as a parent have to protect the child that is getting hurt in this situation.  So I&#39;m definately with you on this one Ren.  I can do the whole gentle parenting, coming up with solutions, compromising, whatever anyone wants to call it with my 8 year old.  She is your what society would consider &quot;normal&quot;........not that I like that particular label.  Mariah is another story. <br/>\n Mariah does not process things the way other&#39;s would.  Like for instance the whole sitting in front of the seat thing as an example (my kids are both in care seats being that they are both under 50 lbs. so this is just for an example only).  If Lexi and Mariah were arguing over who could sit in the front seat and we decided that to meet both needs we would take turns doing this.  What would happen in our case is that Mariah would end up on the ground outside kicking and screaming because she could not sit in the front seat this particular time.  And when she is kicking and screaming we can&#39;t even talk to her......she can&#39;t be reasoned with.  I find that there are times that we just can&#39;t meet everyones needs....especially in the short term.  We do try to come up with compromises (or whatever word each person wants to attach to it), but we just find that with parenting a special needs child we can&#39;t always do that.  <br/>\n  Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nRen Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          ~~<br/>\nWe have found that there are alternatives to being coercive, even if<br/>\nsomeone is trying to harm someone~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThen please give a useful example of what you do when a young child is<br/>\ntrying to physically punch a sibling (while that person is trying to<br/>\nget away) cussing and screaming at them, while the parent is running<br/>\ntowards them because there was no warning about the trigger. <br/>\nWhen you try to speak calmly to this child, or get in between them, or<br/>\nhave the victime get away, the child tries to punch, harm or otherwise<br/>\nhurt ME to get to the victim. <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil he is removed from the room, OR that person locks themselves in<br/>\na room (which I don&#39;t feel is very fair when you&#39;re being attacked) he<br/>\nwill not hear words intended to help, he will not stop (even goes to<br/>\nthe door to try and smash in as I&#39;m there trying to deflect and<br/>\ndiscuss possible options and hear what is angering him).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe stopping harm is essential and part of our job as parents.<br/>\nAllowing a person to hurt another person is not acceptable.

Keon can have a very physical way of<br/>\nworking out is emotions (including happy, sad, angry, tired, content,<br/>\netc.)  There have been many times that I have had to distract Keon<br/>\nfrom his emotions temporarily, especially when people or property are<br/>\nat risk of injury.  I don&#39;t see it as coercion.  I see it as breaking<br/>\nhis physical reaction long enough to get him in a safe environment<br/>\nwhere he can be more physical.  Sometimes that means taking him to a<br/>\npark or stream and letting him throw things.  Sometimes it means going<br/>\nto his room (with him) and stroking his back while he throws a rage on<br/>\nhis bed or floor.  Coercion would be convincing him that he didn&#39;t<br/>\nneed to express himself so physically.  Distraction is breaking the<br/>\nmoment until he can safely express himself how he needs to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had the pleasure of watching Ren parent her children and know<br/>\nsweet little Jalen who can have a powerful personality.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nrecall her using methods that I viewed as coercive.  I felt she was<br/>\nalways respectful towards as many people&#39;s needs as she could.<br/>\nSometimes that meant distracting one of her children momentarily.<br/>\nMaybe it is a difference of what we consider coercive.  Perhaps to an<br/>\nunschooler distraction may appear coercive whereas to someone not as<br/>\nfamiliar with unschooling and/or consensual living  distraction may<br/>\nnot seem coercive at all.  I truly see coercion as that which one does<br/>\nto force someone to change one&#39;s mind.  m-w.com defines coerce as:<br/>\n1 : to restrain or dominate by force &lt;religion in the past has tried<br/>\nto coerce the irreligious -- W.

Sometimes they are obvious but sometimes not. Then we<br/>\nwork at throwing out ideas for solutions until we reach one where<br/>\neveryone is happy. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like exactly what we do. But meeting needs in the long-term is<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m more concerned about rather than in each moment. I still have<br/>\nnever heard a great breakdown of what happens when two people want<br/>\nopposing things OR the same thing (ie; the front seat). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, we work it out until we come to a mutually agreeable solution,<br/>\nbut that often means compromise....Sierra might not get the front seat<br/>\nright now, but she gets it on the way back or some similar compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how giving up something you initially wanted is a bad thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh does not want ANY pets. None, ever. Sierra and I want chickens,<br/>\ndogs, etc.... Dh has allergies to consider also. Yes, we care more<br/>\nabout his comfort level than having the animals, BUT we aren&#39;t getting<br/>\nexactly what we want either. We&#39;re giving something up. Not a big deal<br/>\nreally........<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mini-farm isn&#39;t going to happen, though I will explore components<br/>\nof it to satisfy some of those needs....like beekeeping and such.<br/>\nCompromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: more CL","postDate":"1164034570","msgId":19085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzYS43NzE5ZmI3LjMyOTMxYzBhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19098,"prevInTime":19084,"nextInTime":19086,"topicId":19085,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/20/2006 12:56:51 A.M.
