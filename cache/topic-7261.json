We can tell you that we&#39;ve<br/>\nreached deeper and more meaningful relationship levels, watched<br/>\nlearning blossom in joy and peace and developed trust that is unshakeable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing happens here.

It works.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why you&#39;ll hear about it over and over and over again here. It<br/>\nworks better for unschooling if the parenting issues are examined.

Almost everyone I  know that&#39;s not a radical <br/>\nunschooler has never read a parenting book or had to  challenge their way of <br/>\nparenting.  I had to nearly from the  moment my son was born.  I have always <br/>\nwondered if I would have ever found  unschooling if my kids were just like <br/>\neveryone else&#39;s.  No one else I know  thinks there is anything &quot;wrong&quot; with their <br/>\nlives, because everyone has the same  issues (bedtime struggles, tv time, <br/>\nschool trouble).  They don&#39;t  know the freedom is out there, I doubt I would have <br/>\neither.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy friend is a somewhat unschooler because she believes in this form of  <br/>\neducation, but she has never wanted to set her children free nor has she found  <br/>\nherself in a difficult enough situation to question herself.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: another question","postDate":"1130713649","msgId":7290,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRrM2puaCtnaWdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7261,"nextInTopic":7294,"prevInTime":7289,"nextInTime":7291,"topicId":7261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*I have an unschooling friend whose children just always go along.

It <br/>\nisn&#39;t that she<br/>\n<br/>\nnever considers her children, it is just that she rarely *has* to.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she ever ask her kids &quot;Would you like to do these math <br/>\nworksheets?&quot;  The problem I see with this is that just because kids <br/>\nare &quot;compliant&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t seething with resentment <br/>\ninside.  My little sister was extremely compliant and seemingly had <br/>\nthe least amount of resentments during our childhood, but now she <br/>\nhas found her voice and she is ANGRY at many things.  She complied <br/>\nbut she was not happy about complying; she just couldn&#39;t find her <br/>\nvoice to express that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would never tell my kids &quot;Let&#39;s do these worksheets&quot;, to me that <br/>\nis SO not unschooling!  Now, if my kids came to me and said, &quot;These <br/>\nmath worksheets are really interesting, I would really like to do <br/>\nthem, would you help me?&quot;, that is unchooling, although, the <br/>\nworksheet thing is so schooly.  When children are willing to do <br/>\nanything the parent asks it worries me that they don&#39;t know how to <br/>\nthink for themselves or that they don&#39;t really have a voice in their <br/>\nhouse, it makes me wonder if they are really unschooled.  I want my <br/>\nkids to have a voice so I ask them quite frequently &quot;Is this what <br/>\nyou want to do or are you doing it because that is what everyone <br/>\nelse wants to do?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n*It isn&#39;t that she never considers her childern, it is just that she <br/>\nrarely *has* to.........*  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo me unschooling is ALWAYS considering your children!  I would <br/>\nnever tolerate my husband to tell me &quot;We are going to this football <br/>\ngame today&quot; without asking me first if that is what I want to do.  <br/>\nAt the same time, I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to my children.  They <br/>\ndeserve the same respect that we give any human being.  That is <br/>\nactually something that really helped me transit to radical <br/>\nunschooling also, I would constantly ask myself &quot;Would I do this to <br/>\nmy husband?, or my dad, or my friend.........&quot;  If the answer was no <br/>\nI would have to reconsider what I was doing.  It is also good to go <br/>\nback and time and remember how we felt when our parents did certain <br/>\nthings arbitrarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\nChildren aren&#39;t coloring books.
