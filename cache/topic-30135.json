Lisa and her family","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-576143609\">Dear Folks,<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies once again for the cross-posting.  Again, my goal is to <br/>\nreach as many folks in the unschooling community as I can.  Lisa and <br/>\nher family (Larry, husband, and Roxanne & Fire), really need every <br/>\nbit of positive energy flowing their way as possible.  If this is the <br/>\nfirst you&#39;re hearing about this, please see below for a brief <br/>\nsynopsis of what&#39;s going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unschooler here in New York has organized a regular weekly healing <br/>\nmeditation time for Lisa, and I am forwarding her message to you now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;There is a small group of us that have decided to have a weekly <br/>\n&gt;meditation for Lisa.  We have chosen Sunday evenings at 6 pm (EST) <br/>\n&gt;for about a half hour.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Last Sunday there were 8 of us doing a guided visual meditation <br/>\n&gt;sending out lots of positive energy, positive thoughts, lots of <br/>\n&gt;light and balance.  I was thinking that if we could have as many people<br/>\n&gt;as possible join us &quot;virtually&quot; we could give Lisa a tremendous surge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So wherever you are on Sunday evenings at 6 pm (EST) would you take <br/>\n&gt;a few minutes to just think of Lisa and see her as the strong, <br/>\n&gt;beautiful, creative, vibrant, loving woman she is.  Send her your <br/>\n&gt;prayer, meditation, visualization, energy, light or whatever else <br/>\n&gt;you may have to share.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;In love & light,<br/>\n&gt;In peace & harmony,<br/>\n&gt;Jean McGee<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would like to add that sending a dose of positive, healing energy <br/>\nto Larry and Roxanne and Ruby would probably be a good thing, too, <br/>\nand of course, Reiki practitioners are wholeheartedly encouraged to <br/>\ndo their thing, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nVery briefly, for folks who don&#39;t know, Lisa Heyman is an unschooling <br/>\nmom who lives in New York State.  She has been a passionate, <br/>\nunwavering, intelligent advocate and has been active on many of these <br/>\nlists.  She has attended, participated in, and/or spoke at several <br/>\nL&L and Northeast Unschooling Conferences that I know of.  Very <br/>\nrecently, after an extended period of uncertainty about what has been <br/>\ngoing on with her, Lisa finally received a diagnosis of amyloidoisis <br/>\n(for information about amyloidosis, please see the link below), which <br/>\nhas caused grave, docs say irreversible damage to her heart.  The <br/>\nprognosis for amyloidosis tends not to be very good at all.  However, <br/>\nLisa is a strong, young, healthy, vital person, and I believe that if <br/>\nanyone can disprove a prognosis like that, it&#39;d be Lisa!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amyloidosis.org/whatisit.asp\">http://www.amyloidosis.org/whatisit.asp</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to contact Lisa or if you have any questions, <br/>\nplease contact me off list.  Lisa is in the hospital now, and she&#39;s <br/>\nhanging in there.  Please do forward this message to anyone you feel <br/>\nwould want to know about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, and apologies again for the redundant messages.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\nmarji @ gaiawolf . org</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30126,"nextTopicId":30125}}
