However, along the way, we&#39;ve also started moving toward<br/>\nvegetarian - we recently heard a term &quot;flexitarian&quot; - that is, we<br/>\ngenerally eat veg but might on occasion eat some fish or other animal<br/>\nmeat. In a given week, most of our meals are totally vegetarian, edging<br/>\ntoward vegan even. So, how does this play out with DS, almost 9, who&#39;s<br/>\nnever been limited on what, when, how he eats? Same as always,<br/>\nbasically. He eats what, when, how he chooses. Most of the time, the veg<br/>\noptions are fine with him - DH makes an awesome veg chili for instance<br/>\n(served with shredded cheese and sour cream sides, sometimes homemade<br/>\ngaucamole and flour tortillas too). Other times, he&#39;s not thrilled by<br/>\nthe choice and opts for something else. The other night, for instance,<br/>\nwe were having roasted veggies and couscous. The texture of the couscous<br/>\nwas just not right by DS - so he grabbed a couple of hot dogs. His<br/>\nchoice. <br/>\n <br/>\nForcing anyone to anything is not a good choice - try forcing a sapling<br/>\ntree branch away from the way it is growing and see what happens when<br/>\nyou release the controls - ouch! We just communicate, provide info (a<br/>\nreally cool poster we found showing what nutrients are from what food<br/>\nitems, geared to vegetarian eating - DS was amazed in a happy &quot;Cool!&quot;<br/>\nway when he saw that whole grains were in almost ALL the categories),<br/>\nand give him the same access to the grocery choices (he helps with the<br/>\nshopping most of the time anyhow) that us grownups have. You could<br/>\n-force- all-veg eating BUT you&#39;d be facing the backlash in terms of<br/>\nrelationship as well as what would likely happen outside of your view<br/>\n(at friends&#39; homes, once he gets old enough to be out and about on his<br/>\nown, etc). Consider: how would you react if someone -forced- you to add<br/>\nmeat into your eating, &quot;for your own good&quot; even? So, why would you do<br/>\nthe same to your son? <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, most &quot;veggie eating pets&quot; are eating things like lettuce, celery,<br/>\nand carrots - great for snacking, but not high in the protein content.<br/>\nProviding alternate protein sources might be a start - make a meatless<br/>\nchili for example if your family likes tex-mex. Or, try meatless burgers<br/>\n- we found a recipe for black bean & bulgur &quot;burgers&quot; that looks and<br/>\nworks (shaping wise) remarkably like ground meat (looks kind of like<br/>\nmeatloaf before it&#39;s cooked). We shaped it into cylinders and wrapped it<br/>\nin tortillas one night - it got good ratings from all of us - DS and I<br/>\ntopped it with ketchup and cheddar, DH tried salsa and cheddar. The next<br/>\nday, hubby tried it with BBQ sauce. Total winner - we&#39;re looking at also<br/>\nmodifying the seasonings to make Italian-style &#39;meatballs&#39; for pasta and<br/>\ndoing these faux meatballs in BBQ sauce for next year&#39;s super bowl party<br/>\n(we traditionally bring meatballs in BBQ sauce to the potluck<br/>\ngathering). We also did meatless sushi last week - avocado, roasted red<br/>\npeppers, cucumber, carrot, a little nice mild goat cheese (chevre), and<br/>\nDS tucked some canned tuna on top of some of his battleship sushi - we<br/>\nunderstand the sushi thing - that&#39;s where DS wants to go for his 9th<br/>\nbirthday dinner (our tradition is to have a just-family dinner someplace<br/>\nof the birthday person&#39;s choice on or near the birthday and he picked a<br/>\nsushi restaurant). We also like sashimi which is just fish, no rice or<br/>\nveggies even. Find ways to accommodate BOTH your choice and his - for<br/>\ninstance, cook the meatballs separately in a little tomato sauce so that<br/>\nyou can have pasta with plain sauce and he can have pasta with<br/>\nmeatballs. Lots of ways to accommodate both. And, the &quot;good will&quot; (for<br/>\nlack of a better term) generated because you are working WITH his<br/>\nchoices is likely to grow a situation where he&#39;s more willing to maybe<br/>\nhave one or two meatless meals each week (things like pasta are great<br/>\nstarters in that regard).<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
