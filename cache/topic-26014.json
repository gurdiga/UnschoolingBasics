We knew there would <br/>\nbe family gatherings (at our place and elsewhere) where DS would <br/>\nwant to have some of his toys out. We talked about the situation and <br/>\nused a handy bit of information to *empower* DS regarding small <br/>\nbits/choking hazards: when baby cousin is around, anything that can <br/>\nfit through a toilet paper tube needs to be &quot;guarded&quot; - that is, DS <br/>\nor some adult needs to be keeping an eye on it at all times, it <br/>\ncan&#39;t be just left laying out on it&#39;s own. We kept several empty TP <br/>\ntubes handy (also good to play with, disposable, cheap, even <br/>\ngnawable for a toddler) and DS would check items and decide whether <br/>\nto play with them/bring them and so on. His own choice in the matter <br/>\nwas a big help in his cooperating with making sure stuff got put <br/>\naway - even if HE didn&#39;t do the tidying, he&#39;d make sure it got done <br/>\nby asking for help with it &quot;to make sure it&#39;s safe for baby&quot;. Over <br/>\ntime, DS got better at eyeballing sizes AND cousin got older. Now, <br/>\nwe&#39;re going to be doing that again because another SIL is due next <br/>\nMarch (now DS is 9 and &quot;baby&quot; cousin is 4).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: games with small pieces","postDate":"1188319561","msgId":26034,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZiMWpnOStucTVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhdjBibStrcGdqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26027,"nextInTopic":26035,"prevInTime":26033,"nextInTime":26035,"topicId":26014,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***1.How to keep it safe for baby?*** Does your baby put stuff in her mouth?

We <br/>\ngot crates of duplo at garage sales so that Felicity and her friends <br/>\ncould build really complicated structures and still keep the <br/>\nindividual pieces big. Wooden train tracks are complex but the pieces <br/>\nare big. We invested in hundreds of pieces of train, track trains, <br/>\ntrain destinations etc. By the time the third was born we started <br/>\ngetting lots of small stuff, but it still helps to have lots of <br/>\ncomplex big stuff that we can all do together.<br/>\n-Playing on cookie sheets at a high the table where the baby couldn&#39;t <br/>\nreach and the edges made the pieces less likely to fall on the floor.<br/>\n-In our living room we got a gated metal enclosure and put it in the <br/>\ncorner (by KIDCO I think-similar to what people use around fire <br/>\nplaces for child proofing fireplaces, but hexagonal) . The older kids <br/>\ncould open and close the gate, the baby could not. They still all got <br/>\nto be in the same room. This would often frustrate the baby though.<br/>\n-At one point we had a graco play yard set up for my three year old <br/>\nto play with small pieces in (she needed help in and out) and the <br/>\ngated enclosure for my then 5 year old to play with different small <br/>\npieces both my small living room.  It helped not just with safety, <br/>\nbut also prevented the baby (known at that time as babyzilla) from <br/>\nknocking down or ripping apart everything that the older girls were <br/>\ndoing. It was their choice when to go in or out of these enclosures, <br/>\nand they were solutions we came up with together. It sounds crazy, <br/>\nbut it helped them all be able to play in the same room and be close <br/>\nto mama at the same time.<br/>\n-The older girls also play together or separately on a high captain&#39;s <br/>\nbed where the baby can&#39;t climb up ...yet.<br/>\n-I think the ultimate would be a raised loft with a rope ladder (to <br/>\npull up) in the living room. Even an ikea loft bed might work for this.<br/>\n- My 3 year old was always a big pacifier user as a baby. Giving it <br/>\nto her when we were using small things or paint tended to keep her <br/>\nfrom putting other things in her mouth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before the main problem with most of these solutions is <br/>\nthat the baby gets very annoyed that she can&#39;t follow her sisters and <br/>\nplay with the small pieces too. I try to distract her, but the big <br/>\nsisters are hands down her favorite activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you come up with any other ideas -let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nEmilie (Felicity 6, Cecilia 3, Charlotte 1)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:games with small pieces","postDate":"1188312200","msgId":26027,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZiMWNhOCsxbXZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1MjYzQjY5QEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":26024,"nextInTopic":26034,"prevInTime":26026,"nextInTime":26028,"topicId":26014,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
