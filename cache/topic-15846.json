When someone learns to remember to say<br/>\n&quot;women&quot; when they mean women, suddenly girls BECOME women in their<br/>\nminds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNursing and childbirth counselors and midwives remind women to change<br/>\ntheir terminology.  If a woman says, &quot;My doctor says I have to...&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me...&quot;  it&#39;s really worth interrupting and<br/>\nasking them to change the words and thought to , &quot;My doctor<br/>\nrecommends...&quot; or &quot;My doctor doesn&#39;t believe...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf woman give ownership of their babies to the doctor, they will not<br/>\nbe able to make decisions and to act on their own beliefs without a<br/>\ndoctor&#39;s approval or permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents retain ownership of their children&#39;s learning, the<br/>\nchildren cannot learn on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve just said above is / will be / has been misinterpreted to<br/>\nmean the parents should throw up their hands, back off, and not say a<br/>\nword.  That&#39;s not what I mean at all.   Possibly the very same<br/>\ninteractions can occur, but the balance of power and responsibility<br/>\ncan change by changing the phrasing and definitions.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can he unschool and still accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that different in wording only from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still<br/>\nhave him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s 180 degrees of difference mentally, and very little<br/>\ndifference in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a change worth making?<br/>\nI think it&#39;s absolutely necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen forceful suggestions are made here, though, sometimes people<br/>\ntake it as criticism or attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re trying to help push someone&#39;s car and it&#39;s not going<br/>\nanywhere, sometimes pushing harder helps.  Occasionally, though, you<br/>\njust HAVE to say, &quot;Is it in neutral or not?&quot;   If they say, &quot;No, it&#39;s<br/>\nin first gear, push harder,&quot; what are you going to say?   You stop<br/>\npushing and say &quot;You HAVE to put it in neutral first.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo before anyone can enjoy the benefits of unschooling they HAVE to<br/>\n&quot;put it in neutral.&quot;  They have to take off the emergency brake.<br/>\nOtherwise the car won&#39;t move.  Too many people say &quot;We tried pushing<br/>\nthe car, it didn&#39;t move, we bought a new one.  Pushing cars never<br/>\nworks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want.
