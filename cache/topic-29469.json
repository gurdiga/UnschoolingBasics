I recently wrote about a few<br/>\nweeks ago and me yelling at my youngest so obviously I still have things to<br/>\nwork on, but I believe that was my transition moment (someone else related<br/>\nthis moment to birth when the transition period of birth is the hardest<br/>\nperiod) because I haven&#39;t had anything near that extreme since.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would have told me 3 1/2 years ago though, when I first stumbled upon<br/>\nunschooling, that I would be a radical unschooler, I would have told you you<br/>\nwere crazy, but here I am. &quot;Crazy&quot; with you all. I thank God for those early<br/>\nmoments when all those wonderful ladies that I argued with, planted the seed<br/>\nfor me to be a better mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were of course more little moments, but I shared the biggest ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nWife to Roger (together 10 years)<br/>\nMum to Marti (7.5) and Lilly (4)<br/>\nBabysitter to Stella (3.5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What you give to your children enriches them.

Keep it comin&#39; girl!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-==<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;G&gt; I&#39;ll try. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really helps on this list---as well as all the other unschooling <br/>\nlists---to understand that no one&#39;s here to make you feel bad. Everyone <br/>\nhere that posts is trying to help. We *WANT* you and your children to <br/>\nbe happy and at peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re feeling attacked and bombarded, that&#39;s a really good time to <br/>\nlook around, take a deep breath, and figure out why you&#39;re feeling that <br/>\nway. No one&#39;s coming at you in an all out attack---we&#39;re all here to <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concern for this 11 year old we&#39;ve been discussing this week is that <br/>\nhe&#39;s feeling as attacked at home as his mother feels she is on the <br/>\nlist. No one&#39;s said that she&#39;s a horrible mother who doesn&#39;t love her <br/>\nkids. No one but *her*. That&#39;s how she FEELS. Her son may have the same <br/>\nfeelings---that he&#39;s being attacked and that he&#39;s hearing things from <br/>\nhis mom that she hasn&#39;t really said. To the person on the *receiving* <br/>\nend, it doesn&#39;t matter what the other is saying; what matters is how <br/>\nthe receiver is feeling and how the receiver &quot;hears&quot; what&#39;s being said. <br/>\nIt&#39;s ALL about perception.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one needs to &quot;think twice&quot; about posting. I&#39;m not &quot;out to get you&quot;! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; But if you post, I want to help. A lot of *my* helping comes from <br/>\nexamining what you write. I don&#39;t know you. I don&#39;t have a vendetta out <br/>\non you! &lt;G&gt; Nine times out of ten, you&#39;re anonymous.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s *not* just about the poster. Karen&#39;s still here, but sometimes <br/>\nposters leave after hearing something they aren&#39;t ready for. That&#39;s OK. <br/>\nOften they come back in a few weeks or months. But when things get this <br/>\nraw and open, very often it hits close to home for another 10-12 <br/>\nreaders who *don&#39;t* post. It makes a difference in someone else&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was just starting out, I don&#39;t think I ever posted about a <br/>\ndifficult time for me, but there were plenty of people who did. And the <br/>\nanswers they got helped me grasp this weird concept of children as <br/>\nworthy beings with few life tools. I just read and read and read. I&#39;d <br/>\ngo back and read the archives. Often I scratched my head at how in the <br/>\nworld that would work. Often I got angry inside at the folks doing the <br/>\nwriting (they never knew). Sometimes I&#39;d go out in my garden and yell <br/>\nat the ground and the weeds about how CRAZY and mean these folks <br/>\nwere---WHO DID THEY THINK THEY WERE???<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t long before I figured out that they were right---and that I <br/>\nwas fighting because I was so wrong and couldn&#39;t make that leap.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, NOW it makes sooo much sense! &lt;G&gt; But parts didn&#39;t at first. <br/>\nI had to think through them---some for a very long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s GOOD that Karen posted---whether she wants to hear the advice or <br/>\nnot. Whether she accepts it as valid or not. It may help a dozen others <br/>\nwith the same/similar issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a lot more posts I was planning to &quot;pick apart&quot;---but I <br/>\nthink I&#39;ll leave them for a while. Karen will figure it out---or not. <br/>\nOnly she can change her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else has something they&#39;d like to add, I&#39;d be happy to <br/>\nattack---er---ummmm----I mean *address* that too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nMore new features than ever.
