Don&#39;t listen to them. It&#39;s a scam.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s school, right? What better place is there to experiment? School, <br/>\nwhile not exactly a playground, is supposed to be a safe place. It&#39;s <br/>\nsomewhere that the consequences are small, but are there. Just enough <br/>\nto deter you, but not enough to hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this was in my head as I hid out in the bathroom. These <br/>\nthoughts and justifications dind&#39;t come to mind as I slithered down the <br/>\nhallway. It wasn&#39;t there to console me as I was caught and dragged back <br/>\ndown the hallway, onto the bus. The neurons didn&#39;t fire as I sat, in <br/>\ntears, through a bitter interrogation and reprimand by the principal. I <br/>\nnever realized them as I scrubbed the desks and shelves during my <br/>\nSaturday detention. In fact, they didn&#39;t hit me with full force until <br/>\nseveral days ago -- a full year or so after the event took place.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time, other kids asked me what it was that made me do it. <br/>\nIt seemed so silly, so pointless. I wasn&#39;t the kind of kid that did <br/>\nthese things, they said. I always apologized, or mumbled, or tried to <br/>\nchange the subject. The truth was I really didn&#39;t know what kind of kid <br/>\nI was.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, however, I have an answer for them. It was part of my education -- <br/>\na more important part that Science or History could ever be. They were <br/>\nevents that did more to flesh me out as a person, and build my <br/>\ncharacter than all the boring lectures put together. And that&#39;s the way <br/>\nit should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the kind of thing that the big folks don&#39;t understand, or at <br/>\nleast they often pretend not to. They deliver their harsh words with <br/>\nall the anger they can muster, and perhaps, they truly are angry. But <br/>\nsome part of me can&#39;t help but wonder if deep inside they really <br/>\nunderstand. Somehow perhaps, they know that it&#39;s a test. A test meant <br/>\nto crush the self-confidence of children, and, in doing so, have it <br/>\ngrow back even stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s true, I want to tell them that there are easier ways. Ones <br/>\nthat work not through hatred and pain, but through love. Ways that <br/>\nbring out the inner strength of those who are weak, and cultivate it in <br/>\nthose that are stronger. Ways that teach all of us -- both the <br/>\noppressor and the opressed -- that we&#39;re in this fight together. <br/>\nInstead of fighting each other, and sowing hatred that will last <br/>\nthroughout our lives, why don&#39;t we work together to solve the problem, <br/>\nand share the love that we all want and need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like such a better solution. I&#39;m a human, not some lab rat <br/>\nthat needs to be rewarded and punished. I have reasons for what I do, <br/>\nyou have reasons for what you want. Things between us can&#39;t be so <br/>\ndifferent that we can&#39;t work them out eventually. You&#39;re probably <br/>\nthinking that this isn&#39;t just a good lesson for school, but a good <br/>\nlesson for life. And you&#39;d be right. And if it&#39;s such a good lesson, <br/>\nhow come we don&#39;t teach it through our actions? That&#39;s the way it seems <br/>\nto me at least. But I&#39;m not the one who makes the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/school/2000/12/12/\">http://www.aaronsw.com/school/2000/12/12/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s a small world...but a BIG life!&quot;   ~Aaron McGlohn. aged 6<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.
