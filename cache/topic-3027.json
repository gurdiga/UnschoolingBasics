It&#39;s going back to the <br/>\nrelationship you had before he got to &quot;school age&quot; and exploring <br/>\nlife together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What does a typical day look like?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL &quot;typical&quot; yeah right. An &quot;averaging&quot; of our days is something <br/>\nlike:<br/>\n<br/>\nI get up and go to work. DH and DS get up when they&#39;re done <br/>\nsleeping. Food happens when someone gets hungry. TV, videogames, <br/>\nbooks, magazines, drawing, toys and games all happen in varying <br/>\namounts and at varying times. Laundry gets done, dishes get washed, <br/>\nassorted tidyings occur, food gets prepared as needed. I get home in <br/>\nthe evening and we eat dinner. After dinner, the table gets cleared, <br/>\nstuff gets put away, then more TV, videogames, toys and games, books <br/>\nand magazines happen. One evening per week, DS goes to MIL&#39;s while <br/>\nDH and I have some time together - whether it&#39;s a quiet dinner or <br/>\nshopping for gubicide for the lawn. Another evening is my date with <br/>\nDS - we get some nice time to sit and chat and DH gets some time to <br/>\nhimself which he needs. During the summer, Friday evenings often <br/>\nmean going to the nearby drive in with a bucket of chicken or a <br/>\npizza and a sackful of snacks and enjoying a double feature. Friday <br/>\nafternoons DH and DS have a standing playdate with another <br/>\nhomeschooling family - I think we&#39;re into the 3rd or 4th year of <br/>\nthis arrangement. Sometimes there are &quot;adventures&quot; - a trip to the <br/>\nscience center or the aquarium or a &quot;Big&quot; trip like to the Bronx Zoo <br/>\nor the Amer Museum of Nat History with our hs group. Grocery <br/>\nshopping and other errands happen as needed - sometimes as a whole <br/>\nfamily event, sometimes just one or two (me, me and DS, DH, DH and <br/>\nDS, like that). It looks exactly like life looks when there&#39;s no <br/>\nschool - picture a day in mid-July, no school, just time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;How do you <br/>\n&gt; keep records for the school board/dept. of education if needed?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t need to at all. The laws of your state would determine what <br/>\nyou need to keep record of - keep the minimum required, and as out <br/>\nof the way of life and learning as much as possible. A journal, a <br/>\nscrapbook, a bunch of folders you can slip things into or slip <br/>\nphotos of projects and events into, whatever. It need not intrude on <br/>\nthe family&#39;s life really.

I don&#39;t keep academic records<br/>\nand don&#39;t need to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have 2 children, 1 husband, 1 dog, and 2 gerbils :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have one daughter, Sierra, age 7 (she&#39;ll turn 8 on the last day of the<br/>\nLive & Learn conference) and one son, Quentin, age 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve unschooled since May 2000, so neither has ever attended school.  My dh<br/>\nworks from home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about a typical day, but here is today - <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nToday  6/06/06<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI got up early (this is REALLY early for me) about 7 a.m.  (My dream woke me<br/>\nup - before my alarm went off).  I turned my alarm clock off.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI got dressed.  Rubbed Sierra&#39;s back to wake her up.  Started on her lunch<br/>\nthat she had to take to camp.  Rubbed her back again.  Woke up Quentin - who<br/>\ngot up & ate breakfast & got his DS & shoes fairly quickly.  I loaded up the<br/>\ncar with the 2 kids - and lunch box and water bottles and Sierra&#39;s clothes<br/>\n(she got into the car in her jimmies)  & my stuff & we left the house about<br/>\n8:05 a.m.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDrove downtown, about a 25 min drive.  On the way there, Sierra asked if she<br/>\nHAD to do the clay class.  It was too hard, she didn&#39;t like it, etc etc.  So<br/>\nwe discussed it.  I agreed to pick her up at lunchtime  so she didn&#39;t have<br/>\nto do clay.  Sierra ate her breakfast yogurt in the car. Got downtown.<br/>\nFound a parking place and a dime for the parking meter.  Sierra got dressed.<br/>\nWalked Sierra to her class.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThen Quentin & I drove around looking for silver mylar paper (for Link&#39;s<br/>\nmirror shield which we are trying to build) - we haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>\nMichaels keeps saying they&#39;ll be getting some in soon.  We stopped for movie<br/>\ncandy at Walgreen&#39;s.  Stopped at Target to look for the Bionicle 3 movie.<br/>\nThey didn&#39;t have it.  So we went to Borders and they did.  Yeah!   Drove to<br/>\nthe movie theater for the free summer kids movie to see &quot;Space Jam&quot;, which<br/>\nneither of us had seen before.  It was fun.  Afterwards, we drove back<br/>\ndowntown to pick up Sierra.  Then drove home so I could drop off the kids<br/>\nand go to my &quot;beginning jewelry&quot; class which started today.  Ack!  Dh wasn&#39;t<br/>\nhome.  So I called him - he was out running errands.  He agreed to meet me<br/>\nat my class to get the kids.  Hand-off of kids to dh was successful :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI went to my class.  It was great fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI did a few errands on the way home including signing Sierra up for<br/>\ngymnastics camp  next week, and eating lunch at 4 p.m!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was gone,<br/>\n<br/>\nmy son built some bionicles, played video games, played with the dog, and<br/>\nwatched tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy daughter called a neighbor friend to play and they were swimming when I<br/>\ngot home.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTonight, my mom called and she talked to the kids and me.  A relatively<br/>\nstress free phone call for a change.  We are planning a 2-week trip to<br/>\nHawaii with them this summer.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got home, I called 2 of Quentin&#39;s friends to set up playdates - so<br/>\nwe&#39;ve got one scheduled for tomorrow and another on Friday.   Called one of<br/>\nSierra&#39;s friends to try to set up a playdate for tomorrow (just left a<br/>\nmessage).  I was expecting dd to be at art camp until 3:30 p.m. so I<br/>\nscheduled a private dance lesson (for me) tomorrow from 2 -3 p.m. I guess I<br/>\ncan take her with me.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDH informed me that he&#39;ll be in Phoenix next Tuesday.  Aak!  Now I&#39;ve got a<br/>\nscheduling problem - I&#39;ve got my class from 1 - 4 p.m. and Sierra has<br/>\ngymnastics from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.  Hmmm.. I&#39;ll have to work that one out<br/>\nsomehow.  I&#39;ve come up with about 3 options for that so far and am hoping to<br/>\nbe able to schedule a playdate for ds at one of his friends&#39; house.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSaw a quail family out my window - parents & about 10 baby chicks.  The<br/>\nchicks are so tiny - they look like little puff balls.  Called Quentin over<br/>\nto see them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nRead library books to the kids &quot;The night Iguana left home&quot; to dd and<br/>\nGarfield comic books to ds. Rubbed their backs and got them ice water.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow - it is 11 p.m. and everyone is asleep, which is VERY unusual.  The kids<br/>\nare usually up til much later, especially ds.  But not tonight.  I&#39;m doing<br/>\nsome laundry.  Got the stuff together for Sierra&#39;s lunch tomorrow.  Need to<br/>\nget my dance shoes out, so I don&#39;t forget them (I forgot to bring them to a<br/>\nlesson last week.  Oops!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to spend a little time picking up stuff in my office - It is a<br/>\ndisaster zone.  Then I might read a bit.

I&#39;ve been  unschooling for <br/>\nseveral years and I still have &quot;aha&quot; moments.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou say everyone is telling you your child needs structure.  What is  he <br/>\ntelling you?  Or maybe more accurately, what are he behavior and  emotional <br/>\nresponses telling you?  I&#39;m sure you already do this for the  rest of life (he needs <br/>\nto eat at a certain time or take certain things with  him on an outing), so <br/>\nit won&#39;t be too hard to apply it to unschooling.   Does he feel good when you <br/>\nare really involved in his activities or does he  like to spend more time <br/>\nalone?  My son likes to do things on his own and  then show them to me.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlike suggestions.....sometimes even  when he is asking for help &lt;g&gt;.  Does he <br/>\nlike lots of toys and  activities at once or does this overwhelm him and make <br/>\nhim too excited?<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you asked me I would say we are very unstructured.  But my  husband is <br/>\ncoming home from overseas this week and he will inevitably throw us  off-balance. <br/>\n He undoes (because he isn&#39;t part of our rhythm anymore)  what structure and <br/>\nrhythm we do have but don&#39;t see because it is just part of  our lives!  It is <br/>\nalways an eye-opener for me!<br/>\n <br/>\nYou will find your own rhythms and know instinctively what things need to  be <br/>\ndone and when (structure!) because these are the things that keep life  <br/>\nrunning smoothly, especially in families with kids that have higher  needs.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and I suppose a child with any type of non-typical learning style  would <br/>\n&quot;need&quot; imposed structure to learn things in that school idea of proper  <br/>\nlearning.  When those unnecessary ideas are removed, there is no longer  any need <br/>\nfor the imposed structure.  The child will only needs what he  needs to feel <br/>\nsafe and good about himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and have fun!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Newbie","postDate":"1137603970","msgId":9191,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRxbHNpMiszZ3JuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0My41NjExY2JjLjMwZmZhNmRhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":9188,"nextInTopic":9195,"prevInTime":9190,"nextInTime":9192,"topicId":3027,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Jess and welcome!

I still feel the <br/>\noutside pressures acting on me. Really looking forward to lettign <br/>\nthose go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIts been an up and down journey.  It helps me greatly when people say <br/>\nme to me &quot;god, daniel is so smart&quot; because even though he may not be <br/>\nlearning all the stuff that he &quot;should&quot; be learning (ie: maths), he is <br/>\na pretty clued up kid in many other things that you don;t learn in <br/>\nschool. I SO need to remember that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, welcome - I lurk most of the time, but really enjoy the <br/>\ndiscussions. When I get anxious, I find they bring me alot of sanity, <br/>\nthey bring me back to my heart, to why I stepped on this path in the <br/>\nfirst place.
