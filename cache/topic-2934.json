No we didn&#39;t do that w/ help please and<br/>\nthank you,  He Just says it unbidden.  Mostly.  there are some time when he<br/>\nmight be quite taken by something that was given to him and merge with it.<br/>\nWhat I d then is whisper in his hear that he might want to that that person<br/>\nwho gave it to him.  One time I suggested that if he needed to interrupt,<br/>\nsaying, excuse me was a good way to go. Now I hear him on the playground<br/>\nsaying excuse me, excuse me so much so that one of his cousins turned w/<br/>\ndisdain and told him he didn&#39;t have o say it TTHAT much  I think he could<br/>\nuse the word a bit more judiciously but that&#39;s him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs people have said, it&#39;s natural when it&#39;s modeled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAliosn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2925,"nextTopicId":2939}}
