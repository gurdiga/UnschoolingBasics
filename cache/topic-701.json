Lucas is only 5yo and he is very resistant to group <br/>\ninstruction and being told what to do.  <br/>\nMaybe he&#39;s not ready. No sense starting too young or if he&#39;s not interested. <br/>\nMine started at 6 yo and had asked about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while I can understand <br/>\nthe value of this I can&#39;t quite see my child being able to follow the <br/>\nlead of an instructor.  I guess it all depends on the instructor,<br/>\nThe quality of the whole experience very much depends on the instructor. We <br/>\nare very lucky to have found a great fit but we looked at several before <br/>\nfinding one that felt right. The teacher we have is a fantastic martial artist <br/>\nhimself but, more importantly, he is a good human being. His focus is on respect -- <br/>\nself-respect and respect for others. Not standing in straight lines, although <br/>\nthat&#39;s part of the discipline, but treating each other decently, helping <br/>\nothers, respecting yourself. This is a two-way street. He treats the students (and <br/>\ntheir families) with respect and expects the same in return -- and gets it. <br/>\nAlong with hugs. If you can imagine the youngest students running up to hug the <br/>\nguy who just demonstrated how to break bricks -- it&#39;s a strange and wonderful <br/>\ncombination of controlled physical prowess and genuine regard for others that <br/>\nthe kids pick up on and emulate.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut <br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t want anyone being demeaning to my child or forcing him to <br/>\ndo anything he doesn&#39;t want to do, KWIM?  How do martial arts, with <br/>\ntheir strict rules, fit into unschooling?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDone well, it is about proceeding at your own pace to the level you want to <br/>\nachieve. It is not a group sport.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for bringing this <br/>\nup Pam because I have wondered about this...thinking maybe it will be <br/>\nbeneficial in the future.
