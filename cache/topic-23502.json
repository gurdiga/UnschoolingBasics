It should be a way to<br/>\nfind people with similar interests to be your &quot;tour guides&quot;, in a<br/>\nsense, in your world travels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be host families, and traveling families. The job of the<br/>\nhost family will be to help the traveling family plan their trip.<br/>\nThey will help them figure out where to stay (near the host family),<br/>\nwhat type of activities to do, where to eat, how much money to<br/>\nbring, etc. Then, when the traveling family arrives, the host family<br/>\nwill help show them how &quot;the locals&quot; live! The parties involved will<br/>\ndecide how much, or how little vacation time will be spent together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in being a host family, just fill out the<br/>\ndatabase. Then, the traveling families can browse the database, and<br/>\nfind a host family with similar interests, in a location that they<br/>\nwant to visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to be a traveling family, it is preferred that you<br/>\nalso offer to be a host family. You don&#39;t have to have a lot of<br/>\nmoney, a fancy house, or live in an exotic place to do it. You just<br/>\nhave to be willing to open yourself up to another&#39;s way of life!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not recommended to make plans to stay in someone&#39;s home when<br/>\nyou are traveling, especially if you have never met. That way, if<br/>\nthings don&#39;t go as well as hoped, the travelers won&#39;t have to rely<br/>\non the host family, and the host family won&#39;t get &quot;stuck&quot; with the<br/>\ntravelers. If need be, each can go their separate ways!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group is just here to help families hook up. All travel plans<br/>\nshould be made offline. This is a private group, so messages and<br/>\nother features will be visible to only the group members, and new<br/>\nmembers will be heavily moderated. (Spammers will be<br/>\nexcommunicated!) Though just to be on the safe side, phone numbers<br/>\nand addresses especially should be shared offline.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis should be fun! Go see the world!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com\">http://www.thewildtribe.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23499,"nextTopicId":23474}}
