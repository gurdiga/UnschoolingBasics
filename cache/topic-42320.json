But<br/>\n&gt; I���m having some issues about a couple of the videos in particular that<br/>\n&gt; contain significant amounts of sexist and homophobic jokes. These are videos<br/>\n&gt; using the characters from the Super Smash Brothers Wii game, which they both<br/>\n&gt; enjoy.

To him they are OK. It sounds like it has become a<br/>\ncontrol issue. Step back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very against sexist, racist, etc jokes as well. SO I want you to know I<br/>\nam not saying they are ok or that you should be ok with them. Can you find a<br/>\nway to watch them with him. Talk (you listen mostly) about his thoughts and<br/>\nfeeling about the jokes. Let him guide you through his mind. Listen openly,<br/>\nwith no judgment. Know in your heart that he is 5, so young, and that even<br/>\nif you are uncomfortable with how he feels it will change (many times) Just<br/>\nlisten to HIS experience.

It really bothers me to see<br/>\n&gt; him laughing at these jokes. And, if I���m being totally honest, I really<br/>\n&gt; don���t want him to watch them anymore.

Is it my<br/>\n&gt; reaction to them, since I don���t really care if he says ���damn it�� , I<br/>\n&gt; just explained to him that other people might be upset? But when he repeats<br/>\n&gt; sexist and homophobic jokes, *I* get upset? Help!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***It is reasonable for you to feel upset when someone says a &quot;joke&quot; that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>you find offensive. It wouldn&#39;t serve him well in life if you pretended that<br/>\nracist/homophobic/sexist etc jokes had no consequences.  Sometimes humans<br/>\nneed to have things repeated over and over. Not like a broken record but<br/>\nunderstand the impact that it has on others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Malila was small we were in an elevator with an African American woman,<br/>\nmind you she grew up in a multi-cultural neighborhood that was predominately<br/>\nAfrican American. She asked me why the woman had such dark skin and why her<br/>\nwas lighter in comparison. I felt so embarrassed! I was stuck on an elevator<br/>\nwith this HUGE question looming. I took a deep breath and focused on meeting<br/>\nmy child&#39;s need. I answered as openly and honestly as I could. It was short<br/>\nand to the point. It lasted a brief moment but felt like forever. The woman<br/>\nended up smiling at me and not seeming offended.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this taught me is that kids will do and say things that are out of your<br/>\ncontrol and that may be inappropriate or embarrassing. By addressing their<br/>\nneeds and not worrying about what others think you can move on. Sure it<br/>\nwould have been easier for me if she asked in front of her best friend (who<br/>\nwas Af. Am) but she didn&#39;t. It was all about how I handled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may tell these jokes to others and they may get offended.
