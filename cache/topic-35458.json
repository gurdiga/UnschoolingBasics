They get their fill then move onto something else.  My son (11) is currently studing Biology at the college level because he is interested in it.  Should I not be providing him all the material and information he wants as he explores this interest?  So what if he gets immersed.  When he wanted a zillion little green army men and wanted to set up snipers all over the bookshelves, I let him do that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nsnip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have only one child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>\n<br/>\nsuggested.

Sometimes the answer is about getting perspective.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1175915840\">&quot;Is that child unschooled?&quot; &quot;Where the parents unschooled?. ..&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre those the answers to everything? <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the answer is about getting perspective. Sometimes the perspective is if you are parenting in this radically different way, this way that is about a partnership and not about a top down approach, than you can let go of some of your concerns, your worries because you have taken yourself and your family outside the box. The box is an important debilitator and enabler. Within that box a lot of rules do apply, but if you walk outside and look around you, games are games, they aren&#39;t addictions, chores are jobs that you want done but don&#39;t always want to do, food is food you are hungry for, whatever food it is. It&#39;s an amazing thing living outside of that box. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling means that you are there with your children helping them to do what they want to do. If you are there with your kids, if you are with them playing WoW or playing Burnout Paradise (as David is right now with the most amazing advice and support from Simon and Linnaea) or hanging out talking about all the amazing things that fascinate them, than the answer is in the unschooling. Comparing the risks of WoW &quot;addiction&quot; to someone who grew up in a home with an alcoholic parent or in an abusive home or a neglectful home or one where video games where enjoyed only with the guilt of parental disapproval to that of a child within an unschooling household isn&#39;t a like for like comparison. <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nThere are real questions and<br/>\nconcerns. <br/>\n--------------<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely there are real questions and concerns. Nobody is making light of those things. But they are saying that sometimes the conditions that create concerns aren&#39;t the conditions that exist in an unschooling household. Addiction may be about environment more than it is about substance, being concerned about the substance instead of the environment may not be the best approach. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------<br/>\nThings that parents are asking to try to make a life for<br/>\ntheir kids that are happy and have all the things available to them<br/>\nwhile still helping to keep them safe in a world that seems, at times,<br/>\nbent on screwing them up. <br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world that I live in has no ulterior motive when it comes to my children. It isn&#39;t gunning for them, it isn&#39;t waiting for them to fall so that it can rend them limb from limb in some horribly graphic, slow motion scene from Fallout 3 (a game that stuns me, totally loving the mole rats from the post-apocalypse). The world I live in is filled with good things, interesting things, engaging things, moments waiting to be spun into other things. Those things that aren&#39;t so good, aren&#39;t so interesting, aren&#39;t so tasty or appealling get moved to the side of the plate. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nIs it possible to have too much of a good thing?  To play the game so<br/>\nmuch, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>\nthings?  Is it too much to warn/advise/ whatever that this game, unlike<br/>\nMario Bros for example, can become all encompassing and to make sure<br/>\nthat you stay involved?<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know. It has never happened in my house. I have two children, Simon who is 11 and Linnaea who is 8, and neither of them have had any game become so all encompassing that they lose interest in all other things. Usually if something is so exciting they try and share it with the rest of us, they seek us out and call to us and ask us to join in whatever it is that is making their hearts sing. And we come. We come and we share and we help and we encourage. I have found the most amazing walkthroughs on the internet. I get so excited by these games, they are such beautiful pieces of art, I play them. Today Linnaea got frustrated playing Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts. I came and sat with her and she told me there was a race she couldn&#39;t do. I&#39;d done the race a couple of days ago, but it was hard and I&#39;d had to rebuild my car 5 times to win the race. So she let me rebuild her car and it still wasn&#39;t right, so she rebuilt it and won the race the next go.<br/>\n And she played a little longer and then quit to let Simon play after realizing that he&#39;d been waiting to play for an hour and a half (he was busy during the wait, but waiting was frustrating him). <br/>\n<br/>\nNothing has become more interesting to me than Simon and Linnaea. Nothing. That means that when they are absorbed by some new and exciting thing I can be there to help them to meet their needs. I can bring them food and drink. I can help to find the tricks or the shortcuts to make moving from one level to the next easier. Or make sure that they have the next book in the series before they finish the one they are on, or find a way to get to skating a couple of times a month, or more if they want it, or put the next Merlin episode on the calendar so we don&#39;t forget it. Because they are my priority and my joy I get to help facilitate their joy. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------<br/>\nThe other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>\navailabilities.  I have three children as I said.  If I fast forward<br/>\nto a few years from now (or whenever they show an interest in playing<br/>\nWoW) we might see my daughter or just one of my son&#39;s being interested<br/>\nin playing this game.  My daughter is more interested in the outdoors<br/>\nso lets say that she is all about camping and hiking, my youngest<br/>\nwants to swim on a team and my middle child has found WoW. Please help<br/>\nme to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>\nabove case?  There are three of them and only two parents. <br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is hypothetical. Your kids aren&#39;t tearing you into three directions right now. This is a bit of devil&#39;s advocate and a bit of premature worrying, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon prefers to stay home often, however he is really pretty good about coming with us when it is pressing. It helps that David and I try and let him stay home as much as we can. He knows that we are willing to bend over backwards for him which makes him much more accomodating than I can remember being at 11. It helps if the trip into town includes things that interest him, bribery helps. A trip to the game store, going to the library to see what they have to rent, a round of laser tag, all of those help if there is reticence on Simon&#39;s or Linnaea&#39;s part. It also helps if he wants to go into town and get something that we do it. It happens really quickly that we go and do what he wants to do. Do it with food too. Linnaea says she wants samosas, we make samosas for dinner if we have everything or the next day if there is too little time and too few supplies at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are worrying about is hours in a day, but it isn&#39;t all in one day. Sometimes it&#39;s hours in a week or a month or a year, and it helps if you see that it doesn&#39;t all have to happen all at once. Simon and Linnaea see that more and more. They see that David and I do what we can all the time to meet their desires. So if we can&#39;t do it that minute we work to make sure that it happens soon. <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nThere is a fear about this game.  Some of it might very well be<br/>\nunfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids.  The<br/>\nproblem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love<br/>\nthat game.  It can become all that you want to do.  If you have only<br/>\none child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>\nsuggested.  I really would like to know, however, how you do it with<br/>\nmore than one child.  I&#39;m not trying to attack anyone and if the<br/>\nanswer really is, &quot;if you were unschooling correctly you would be<br/>\nfine....&quot; I would like some actual examples of how to help in the<br/>\nsituations that I described. <br/>\n---------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more than one child. I am really involved. I play the games, I skate when we go skating, I bike ride to the store with company in the summer, I swim at the pool, I bounce on the trampolines. Often I do this with both children, often it isn&#39;t that I am being torn in half to be with one versus the other. There is a lot of doing together. Not always. Sometimes I have to ask to be with one versus the other, depending on the body language and the holding and the clear, if not stated, desire. Sometimes they don&#39;t like each other, don&#39;t want to be with each other, feel less than the other, but those moments pass and we, so far, move back to getting along and playing together. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I don&#39;t talk to my brother that often. Maybe once a year, e-mail more. He gave me a brilliant Christmas present this year. Our relationship is distant at best. I have no way of making Simon and Linnaea closer siblings than I am with my brother, so I don&#39;t try. I just try and make each of their lives as individual good and engaging as I can and hope that they have enough joy to share with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"&quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] World of Warcraft","postDate":"1232306795","msgId":37873,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwMTE4MTEyNnk3Y2EyODcwN2ozZTdjZTdjMDVmZGY5YjMzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGdrdnIxYStvbjg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdrdnIxYStvbjg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":37870,"nextInTopic":37879,"prevInTime":37872,"nextInTime":37874,"topicId":35458,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is that child unschooled?

They are all really young still so I am the<br/>\nfirst to admit that we are new to unschooling but I, and my husband,<br/>\nplayed WoW for several years so I do feel I have some insight to<br/>\nshare. Though I have heard others mention addiction (and get quite<br/>\npicked apart because they used the poison &quot;A&quot; word) I was not trying<br/>\nto warn about addiction. I really just wanted to point out/ask two things.<br/>\n<br/>\n***** I have three children and a dh that plays WoW. There are times he<br/>\nplays a lot. If he is working on a quest or working on a dungeon or raid. He<br/>\ncan&#39;t leave in the middle of a dungeon or raid, it would affect others he is<br/>\nplaying with.

Actually, right now the two older ones dd12 and ds6<br/>\nare playing Mario Galaxy for many hours a day. My ds especially. He has 29<br/>\npower stars. At this moment he is away from the wii, giving his sister a<br/>\nturn, and playing tech decks with is papa. The only time I discuss his<br/>\nplaying is if he is getting really stressed out about a level. I suggest he<br/>\ntakes a few deep breathes and either go back to it or change levels or play<br/>\nsomething different for a while. He is free to take my advice or not. He<br/>\ntends to follow his heart and take my advice into consideration. He doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwant to feel stressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>\navailabilities.

There are three of them and only two parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n*******My kids are quite far apart in ages and interests. It can be<br/>\nchallenging to keep up with all of them. I don&#39;t aim for perfection (ok well<br/>\nI try not to) my aim is more to be supportive and helpful. For ds6 that<br/>\nmeans buying games and playing with or being near him while he plays. I can<br/>\nplay with the baby or nurse her while he plays. I watch him and comment on<br/>\nhis game. I get him food/drinks etc. We research stuff ont he internet. I<br/>\npick up things he might like when I see them. I play pokemon with him and I<br/>\nfound that I love it. For my older child I do what she tells me :-) She<br/>\nneeds a lot of alone times so I navigate her world according to her needs. I<br/>\nbring her food but don&#39;t get as involved in her world. I read the same books<br/>\nas she is so we can talk about them. She loves that and is always bringing<br/>\nme books. I pick up things she is interested in when I see them. I might<br/>\nemail her somthing I think she will like.<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all well and good, and happy, to say that unschooling parents<br/>\nstay right there with their kids. They bring them food, pay for their<br/>\nacounts, talk about the game.... and so on. How exactly do you do<br/>\nthat without cloning yourself and still have anything for the other<br/>\nchildren?<br/>\n<br/>\n******I am lucky to have a supportive dh. He is right there with the kidlets<br/>\ntoo. In fact he is playing right now while I type (nearby). It seems like at<br/>\nleast one of us (the parents) is attracted enough to an interst to support<br/>\nit thoroughly. I love to support ds6 tech deck by buying his boards and<br/>\nstanding in the store with a toddler for hours while he picks the right<br/>\ndeck.

There are real questions and<br/>\nconcerns.  Things that parents are asking to try to make a life for<br/>\ntheir kids that are happy and have all the things available to them<br/>\nwhile still helping to keep them safe in a world that seems, at times,<br/>\nbent on screwing them up.  And yet the answers all seem to be &quot;that<br/>\nwould never happen to an unschooled child&quot;.  Well, great, but, um, can<br/>\nI still have some advice????<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three children.  They are all really young still so I am the<br/>\nfirst to admit that we are new to unschooling but I, and my husband,<br/>\nplayed WoW for several years so I do feel I have some insight to<br/>\nshare.  Though I have heard others mention addiction (and get quite<br/>\npicked apart because they used the poison &quot;A&quot; word) I was not trying<br/>\nto warn about addiction. I really just wanted to point out/ask two things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible to have too much of a good thing?  To play the game so<br/>\nmuch, especially the &quot;end game&quot; that you lose interest in other<br/>\nthings?  Is it too much to warn/advise/whatever that this game, unlike<br/>\nMario Bros for example, can become all encompassing and to make sure<br/>\nthat you stay involved? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other question goes to real world time and man/woman power<br/>\navailabilities.  I have three children as I said.  If I fast forward<br/>\nto a few years from now (or whenever they show an interest in playing<br/>\nWoW) we might see my daughter or just one of my son&#39;s being interested<br/>\nin playing this game.  My daughter is more interested in the outdoors<br/>\nso lets say that she is all about camping and hiking, my youngest<br/>\nwants to swim on a team and my middle child has found WoW. Please help<br/>\nme to understand how I could be this perfect unschooling parent in the<br/>\nabove case?  There are three of them and only two parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all well and good, and happy, to say that unschooling parents<br/>\nstay right there with their kids.  They bring them food, pay for their<br/>\nacounts, talk about the game.... and so on.  How exactly do you do<br/>\nthat without cloning yourself and still have anything for the other<br/>\nchildren?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a fear about this game.  Some of it might very well be<br/>\nunfounded or only occurring with those horrible schooled kids.  The<br/>\nproblem that I was trying to advise on was the idea that people love<br/>\nthat game.  It can become all that you want to do.  If you have only<br/>\none child you might have the time to stay as involved as has been<br/>\nsuggested.  I really would like to know, however, how you do it with<br/>\nmore than one child.  I&#39;m not trying to attack anyone and if the<br/>\nanswer really is, &quot;if you were unschooling correctly you would be<br/>\nfine....&quot; I would like some actual examples of how to help in the<br/>\nsituations that I described.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: World of Warcraft","postDate":"1219604321","msgId":35547,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGMDA2Nzg2LTM5QzAtNENCMS05QkJBLUFENjJERjk3MTNBOUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxMzcwMWM5MDVmNCQyNzg3ZjM3MCQ4MTAwYThjMEByZWR3aW5lPg==","referencesHeader":"PDcwNjIzNy4xMTI4My5xbUB3ZWI4NjIxMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDw2N2E5ZDc1MDA4MDgyMDEwNTV4MTQ1NjliNjFtODA0OTBjY2RhNzNhNGY1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QTU3OTdFRDEtMUNEQy00OUYxLTkyOTgtOEVDMkQ0NTMwRjg4QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8MDEzNzAxYzkwNWY0JDI3ODdmMzcwJDgxMDBhOGMwQHJlZHdpbmU+"},"prevInTopic":35544,"nextInTopic":37867,"prevInTime":35546,"nextInTime":35548,"topicId":35458,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is also a Level 70 hunter!

I thought it was <br/>\ngoing to be something dreadful, but that is funny.  I found some sights that had that on <br/>\nthere too.  I have never once paid attention to that section of WOW.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds more like he was too young and didn&#39;t understand the game rather than <br/>\nsomething subliminal.  It sounds like a normal response of a child to the game itself.  <br/>\nSubliminal suggestion has never been outlawed BTW.  It is in commercials, TV, sometimes <br/>\nmovies....People don&#39;t realize it because they think it was something the govt voted on <br/>\nand made into law, but it never passed....or at least it hadn&#39;t by 2000.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not making fun of you or your son with the laughing, please understand that...I was <br/>\nthinking it was more of a suicidal or homicidal thing, that it was saying something like <br/>\nthat.  Here again, this conversation goes back to principles.  Our kids rarely play more than <br/>\nan hour of a game be it WOW or PS2.  We have discussed an &quot;all things in moderation&quot; <br/>\nprinciple with them and then let them choose.  We don&#39;t discourage more play, but they <br/>\njust don&#39;t need it in that manner. It&#39;s like Halloween, they could eat all of that candy if <br/>\nthey wanted to, but because they understand the principle of &quot;moderation&quot; they don&#39;t need <br/>\nto eat it all.  They can save, share, toss or eat it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso some children are more sensitive than others.  My dd for example hates the quests <br/>\non WOW but will happily go around blessing everything in sight including squirrels.  WOW <br/>\nis here mostly as an outlet for my husband and a way for he and his best friend to keep in <br/>\ntouch and do something fun long distance. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope your son will be ok.....sorry the game effected him, and you, in that manner.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: World of Warcraft","postDate":"1219285566","msgId":35477,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4aWpudSt0OGNjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU0NkMzODFELTZFRjQtNDY2RC1BMUYxLThGQ0ZFNTcxMzhBMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35473,"nextInTopic":35481,"prevInTime":35476,"nextInTime":35478,"topicId":35458,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I apologize if I offend anyone but I can&#39;t just sit by and not share the information. I wish I had known a long time ago.<br/>\nMonths ago there were posts about WOW and many parents including myself posted about us or our children/husbands playing this game. My son (12 now) played this game almost every day for 9 months, anywhere from 12-15 hours a day and would have strange episodes when he couldn&#39;t play for one reason or another, sometimes shaking uncontrollably. He chose on his own to stop playing about 3 months ago because these episodes scared him so much. <br/>\nThe other night my son was cruising YouTube and found some videos claiming that WOW had subliminal messages. We both kind of laughed about it, not really believing it. We went to the part of the game that the video indicated and my son changed some of the sound settings and we heard it. We spent the morning learning about subliminal messaging and why it is illegal. It was very scary. My son is now so upset that he won&#39;t use his own bathroom and barely will leave the room that I&#39;m in. <br/>\nI am very angry about this and needed to share it with other parents. I had no problem with him wanting to play a game that he loved-I&#39;m upset that he was manipulated and controlled. <br/>\nAgain, I apologize if I have offended anyone. That is not my intention at all. <br/>\nYou can go to YouTube and see the videos for yourselves. I think you would just search world of warcraft subliminal messages. <br/>\n<br/>\nAubrey<br/>\n<br/>\nDillon &#39;96---Emily &#39;98---Madalynn &#39;08<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37937,"nextTopicId":37966}}
