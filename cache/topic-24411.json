Most home and unschoolers use <br/>\nthe CAT test (and I hear it&#39;s really easy and you administer it <br/>\nyourself) that you can purchase from Seton Home (in VA, so turnaround <br/>\ntime is very quick).  Also, depending on when your son turns six, it <br/>\ncould be another 2 years or more until you have to test him.  The <br/>\ncompulsory school age is 6 by September 30th.  There are a couple of <br/>\narea-specific unschooling lists for Virginia.  I know there&#39;s a <br/>\nNovaUnschoolers list and I think one for Richmond and maybe a couple of <br/>\nother places.  I&#39;m in the Hampton Roads area and there are few true <br/>\nunschoolers here, but lots of eclectic homeschoolers.  You might also <br/>\nwant to get on the VaEclecticHS list as well.  Both the HEAV and Va <br/>\nHomeschoolers websites have referrals for evaluators, and I know of at <br/>\nleast one that is an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still haven&#39;t decided if I&#39;m going to do RE or just homeschool under <br/>\noption 1.  My son turns 6 in a month and so if I don&#39;t do RE, we&#39;ll have <br/>\nto test next fall for K (I opted him out of K this year).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie<br/>\n<br/>\nstacyzme wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello all.
