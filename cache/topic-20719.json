He started 1st grade (ps) at 6 and to my utter <br/>\ndismay at the time, hadn&#39;t managed to learn his alphabet.  I was <br/>\nworried (yes, don&#39;t mock me!) he would be behind the other kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe ended up in Reading Recovery first week of Sept and by the end of <br/>\nthe month both his and the Reading Recovery teacher told me in <br/>\nshocked tones that he&#39;d already mastered concepts most kids didn&#39;t <br/>\nget until the spring of 1st grade.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...here&#39;s my own, now more educated, assessment:<br/>\n<br/>\nMarkus always said, &quot;When I go to school I&#39;m going to learn how to <br/>\nREAD.&quot;  I believe what he meant was, &quot;When I go to school I&#39;m going <br/>\nto learn how to read, and by God not until (because school is where <br/>\none learns to read, of course).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also suspect Markus actually already knew how to read, but given <br/>\nthat I couldn&#39;t get him to reliably recite his alphabet, I never <br/>\nreally gave him the opportunity...so we&#39;ll never know for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that it matters.  My &quot;struggling reader&quot; read the entire <br/>\nChronicles of Narnia at 7 in under a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to think of all the things I could have been worrying about <br/>\nbesides his reading skills... ha!<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Incidentally, reading was ALL he learned in 1st grade.  We spend <br/>\nthe last four months arguing every single morning about how he HAD to <br/>\ngo to school.
