I worked with  <br/>\na woman with a 20-ish son who had diabetes that she controlled  <br/>\naccording to the &quot;rules&quot; for diabetics. And boy was he self  <br/>\ndestructive. She couldn&#39;t understand why he was fighting what made  <br/>\nsense and she was distraught. It was pretty obvious to me that he  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fighting common sense but her control.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how sensible the control, control is something to fight  <br/>\nagainst.

It&#39;s getting stressed -- at least from what you  <br/>\nwrite -- that&#39;s a no no. I truly doubt there have been studies done  <br/>\nthat showed video games cause strokes in kids with your son&#39;s  <br/>\ncondition. It&#39;s just an item put on a list by a researcher who took a  <br/>\nguess at things that might raise blood pressure. Then it became an  <br/>\nofficial &quot;no no&quot; because it seemed like some expert must have studied  <br/>\nthis extensively.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could forbid him to see the friend, but that sets him up to learn  <br/>\nto lie and sneak. You could forbid him to play games away from home,  <br/>\nbut how exactly will you make that work? Strap a video camera to him?<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil *he* chooses not to play video games, there isn&#39;t a way for you  <br/>\nto stop him.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could fill him full of fear that he&#39;ll have a stroke if he plays  <br/>\nvideo games (or anything that you want him to avoid doing) but if he  <br/>\nplays and doesn&#39;t have a stroke, he *knows* it&#39;s not a given. He  <br/>\n*can* play and not have a stroke. (And the stress of disobeying to do  <br/>\nsomething he loves could be far worse than video games!)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Much* better to help him play in a safe way. Work *with* him to be  <br/>\naware of his body, to take breaks when he starts feeling a certain  <br/>\nway. Come up with *a lot* of strategies and tweak them.
