That only takes a couple of  minutes.  <br/>\nPersonally I would not for an extended period of time but I think  you have to <br/>\ntake into account the community and the child that is asleep.   Mine would be <br/>\nfreaked to wake up alone in the car.  But that is just my  children.  I think <br/>\nthe 11 year old could easily be distracted.  I  would also know, and now you <br/>\ndo, that your dad does not want that  responsibility, so I would not count on <br/>\nhim either.  If it were me I would  stay outside, bring a book or something <br/>\nand sit while the younger one slept, or  carry Avari inside.  Just me.  But it <br/>\nis good to know that your dad  does not want to be in that situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs far as the house of untouchables.  I think it is  their decision how to <br/>\ncare for their house and your responsibility to care for  your children.  I <br/>\nwould not be comfortable taking my children over there,  at that age.  I would be <br/>\nafraid of damaging something that my parents held  dear.  Our philosophy is <br/>\npeople are worth more than things, but not  everyone shares that feeling.  If <br/>\nthey are unwilling to put things up so  they won&#39;t be damaged, maybe you could <br/>\ninvite them over to your house to visit  or for lunch or something.  That way <br/>\nthey get to visit with you and your  family, as they said they wanted.  And <br/>\nyour children will feel comfortable  and will be more able to connect with the <br/>\ngrandparents.  If you do the  inviting, your step/parents will also feel wanted. <br/>\n They will feel you are  making an effort.

It *is* reasonable for your father to do so when he&#39;s  <br/>\noutside with the kids, but it would be responsible to specifically  <br/>\nask him.

They&#39;ve never helped with the kids, don&#39;t visit often, put the  <br/>\nonus on us. ETC, but I don&#39;t mean to start whining. TIA to everyone  <br/>\nwho reads this long missive and has something to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy (step)mom called the other day, and we were chatting a little bit.  <br/>\nShe got onto me for leaving Avari asleep in the truck while I came  <br/>\ninside, the whole deal was that I had just taken seven kids to the  <br/>\npark, and I really had to go to the bathroom. The older kids were  <br/>\noutside playing, and I mentioned that I was going in to pee. When I  <br/>\ncame out, my dad was outside playing with the kids so i left her out  <br/>\nthere because I figured it was a nice day, the windows were down and  <br/>\nhe&#39;d hear her. My mom and I chatted for a little bit, and my dad   <br/>\nbrought her inside and said she&#39;d woken up. Okay, seems normal to me.  <br/>\nSo a few days later she called and said that what I had done was  <br/>\ncompletely irresponsible and filled my ear with &#39;what-ifs&#39;.   <br/>\nApparently my dad went outside because he felt it wasn&#39;t safe and it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t &#39;fair&#39; of me to expect my kids or my dad to watch her. Then on  <br/>\nwith What if the police had come, what if the car was stolen, what if  <br/>\nsomeone kidnapped her, what if someone wrecked into the truck,  <br/>\nwhatever she&#39;d stopped breathing. On and on, and I felt a little  <br/>\nguilty, okay, all those are plausible, but very unlikely. So number  <br/>\none, is it completely unreasonable to let a responsible eleven year  <br/>\nold keep an eye on a sleeping baby while he&#39;s playing outside?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn to my second story, I was very defensive after this onslaught, and  <br/>\nreplied to each of her concerns one-by-one, okay, if dad felt it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fair why didn&#39;t he say anything, they live in a safe  <br/>\nneighborhood, you can&#39;t start my truck without the computerchip key,  <br/>\nJosh was outside and no one would have gotten into the truck without  <br/>\nhim knowing. I was angry by then and conversation was stilted and we  <br/>\nhung up. After a while I called back and told her I was sorry, I was  <br/>\nbeing defensive and that I appreciated her concerns blahblahblah. She  <br/>\nis my mom, kwim?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo apparently this opened up a door to yet another grudge she&#39;s been  <br/>\nholding (God and can she hold them). Total background, their house is  <br/>\nfull of antiques and pet stuff and all kinds of intriguing plants and  <br/>\nfountains, statues, clocks. There are no toys whatsoever, we had some  <br/>\nover, she got rid of them because the kids never played with them.   <br/>\nWell, yes, they were all baby toys from when Josh was two or so. They  <br/>\nwere stored in a death trap homemade toybox behind all the dog food,  <br/>\nwater bowls and a litter box. She&#39;s always saying she wants us to  <br/>\ncome over and play, visit, etc, and I finally said outright that it&#39;s  <br/>\nvery hard because there&#39;s nothing for the kids to do, there are too  <br/>\nmany breakables and it&#39;s stressful for ME to control the kids there.  <br/>\nSo we opt not to go. That was huge for me to say and she stewed for a  <br/>\nwhile. A few months ago we were at their house and she had bought a  <br/>\nnew antique table and put a heavy glass fountain on top. She pointed  <br/>\nit out to me and said to be careful with the kids, it&#39;s wobbly. SO I  <br/>\ntold her outright that it was her table and her fountain, and she  <br/>\nneeded to explain to the kids her concerns. It&#39;s not fair for ME to  <br/>\nhave to lay down all these rules, if she wants us to come over, yes?  <br/>\nSo a few weeks ago we went back over after park day, and Josh had  <br/>\npicked up one of my dads flutes he made, and was about to blow on it.  <br/>\nI stopped him and say &quot;You know how Granpa feels about your touching  <br/>\nhis stuff&quot;. That was all I said. And the fact of the matter is that  <br/>\nstuff is much more important to them. ANYWAY....so the phone call I  <br/>\nmentioned earlier turns into her telling me that she has a real  <br/>\nproblem with how snotty I was when I said that. I was like, excuse  <br/>\nme? Well, &quot;it&#39;s important those kids learn that wherever they go that  <br/>\nthey have to ask before they touch things&quot; on and on, hammering it  <br/>\nhome with &quot;they have to learn sometime&quot;. My thought was they will  <br/>\nlearn sometime, but not when they are three, or five or whatever,  <br/>\nwhen they are older. And they know not to touch at museums or  <br/>\nstrangers houses, or whatever. And I told her that most of the houses  <br/>\nwe go to don&#39;t have those rules, the kids are allowed to touch and  <br/>\nlearn and live without all these restrictions. Rachel&#39;s godmother is  <br/>\nawesome, they have a house full of antiques and instruments that the  <br/>\nkids can just go to. And adults gently step in and help them do and  <br/>\nplay. We choose places that are safe to go to...anyway, I was ready  <br/>\nto cry by the time this came around, because my mom kept saying that  <br/>\nher stuff is important to her, and that she has the right to feel  <br/>\nthat way, just on and on about stuff. She said that it was my job to  <br/>\nmake sure they behaved when we came over, which I totally agree, but  <br/>\nI think that is why we choose where we go and we&#39;ll go where it&#39;s  <br/>\neasier on me. And I did tell her that it seemed to me that if you  <br/>\nloved someone you&#39;d want to make it easier for them, rather than  <br/>\nfilling your house up with breakables and expecting kids to live in a  <br/>\nmuseum.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, two things, Avari sleeping in her carseat with Josh watching  <br/>\nher, and what I can say to my mom, am I being unreasonable, should I  <br/>\njust not go over...talking to her is impossible, she&#39;s so toxic with  <br/>\nbaggage from her childhood it&#39;s not even funny. But i love her  <br/>\ndesperately, she&#39;s the mom I chose, one who was able to step in a  <br/>\nlove me regardless of all the crap from my baggage.
