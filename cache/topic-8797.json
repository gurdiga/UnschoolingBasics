Lots of people<br/>\non the lists report using them, but it seems that never for the &quot;advertised<br/>\npurpose&quot; of &quot;encouraging&quot; (= forcing) potty training. <br/>\n<br/>\nRather it was/is for the purpose of increasing and enhancing their<br/>\nchildren&#39;s comfort and Ease in mostly public or sleeping situations. (An<br/>\nunscientific survey based on my recollections!)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never used them at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is Jayn&#39;s potty learning story, a repost from when she was 4 - she is<br/>\nnow 6:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Try and lose the word training from your thinking and you are well on<br/>\ntrack. Also there are many and plenty of youngsters who are not seeming to<br/>\ndo anything until they are 4, then suddenly seem to learn it all overnight. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is four and completely moved from cloth diapers to using the adult<br/>\ncommode all the time, from about 2 ½ to about 3 ½ (no dyedee at night)<br/>\nabsolutely painlessly without any effort from me. She began just as you are<br/>\ndescribing (bar the flush action) [sitting on her potty and pretending to go<br/>\nwhen I went]. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext she would use the potty before we went swimming through her swimsuit,<br/>\nat my invitation. We were away from home at the time with my mother going<br/>\nthrough an illness, so I was surprised that she wanted to start the process<br/>\n her life being disrupted and all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got home in to our apartment, I would ask her whether she wanted to<br/>\nbe without her diaper for a while. I would move the potty around the house<br/>\nto whatever room we were in, and show her how to pour it out  usually she<br/>\nasked me to do it anyway. She would tell me that she had poo-poo in her<br/>\nbutt and then run to her potty. I guess we would have about one accident<br/>\na week, or less. Slowly the potty moved from in any room to the hallway, and<br/>\nfinally the bathroom again. We used diapers when we went out, and then<br/>\nstarted leaving them at home, but taking our potty in the car. She seemed to<br/>\ngo from needing the diapers to simply telling me she wanted to peepee very<br/>\nquickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still used a diaper at night, and towards the end of that she would wake<br/>\nup dry, and use her diaper when she awoke  giggling about it sometimes. I<br/>\nstarted asking her whether she wanted a diaper or not, or taking it off<br/>\nfirst thing, so she became used to going into the bathroom a little while<br/>\nafter waking. There was a brief period of confusion for her about whether<br/>\nshe had her panties or her diaper on  but this only lasted a few nights. We<br/>\nused a couple of washable bedliners (rather than disposable) from Bed, Bath<br/>\nand Beyond to protect our mattress. She has wet the bed once in the last<br/>\nfour or five months.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did not use were pull ups (another invention of the disposable<br/>\ndiaper industry), rewards, punishments, or any other numerous strategies<br/>\nfrom Potty train your child overnight! experts. She still announces her<br/>\nintention to go to the bathroom, although less often. She refuses to use<br/>\nsmall commodes, in the places where kid size ones are available  saying she<br/>\nis a big girl now and will use the big potty. The only help she still<br/>\nrequires of me is wiping her butt  on the occasions where that is<br/>\nnecessary. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It probably links with some of the other threads on control issues!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s great that you are seeing that link.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The 3 yr old just danced and had a good time, <br/>\nbut Nate was really into investigating! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon you will be able to let go of your need to make this distinction...soon<br/>\nyou will see that there is no &quot;just&quot; dancing - that the good time is just as<br/>\nvalid for learning as any kind of more academic looking &quot;investigating&quot;.<br/>\nThere is no lower age limit on investigating.

It is based on trusting that people, <br/>\nincluding kids since they&#39;re people too, will learn what they need <br/>\nwhen and how they need it in ways that work for them. &quot;Radical&quot; <br/>\nunschooling is taking that philosophy of trust and applying it to <br/>\nthe rest of life - trusting that our kids will eat what and when and <br/>\nhow works for them, that they&#39;ll sleep when their body says sleep <br/>\nand wake when they&#39;re finished with sleep, and so on. Treating kids <br/>\nwith the same trust and respect for their individual selves and <br/>\nchoices that you would for a spouse, friend, other adult person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, someone can be unschooling in the academic sense yet have <br/>\nstrictly structured bedtimes, chores, mealtimes, etc. &quot;radical&quot; was <br/>\nadded to differentiate in discussion between folks who extend <br/>\nunschooling into the whole life of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132501282,"authorName":"queenpamedalah","from":"&quot;queenpamedalah&quot; &lt;swombo@...&gt;","profile":"queenpamedalah","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"question from a newbie","postDate":"1136575955","msgId":8797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRwbWdraitnc3IxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8798,"prevInTime":8796,"nextInTime":8798,"topicId":8797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What makes an unschooler radical? ??
