And as my own search for authentic living has <br/>\nbecome <br/>\nmuch more pressing (midlife crisis and all that) I really want my 4yo&#39;s <br/>\nwondrous lifeforce to blossom and not be squelched--which of course leads <br/>\nright <br/>\ninto unschooling.  So I appreciate all the posts that have stretched my <br/>\nthinking <br/>\nand caused me to question a lot of my assumptions.  Especially discussions of <br/>\nbedtimes, tv, food are, to me, probably most helpful in &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>\nunderlying philosophy of trust.  I really appreciated all the posts about tv <br/>\nlimits <br/>\n(which I have relaxed though not yet relinquished).  A lightbulb for me was <br/>\nthe <br/>\npost about &quot;what you do&quot; when you remove the arbitrary limit--ie. you sit <br/>\nwith <br/>\nyour child while he watches, you initiate discussions, answer questions, <br/>\noffer input about what might scare him.  There is so much real learning <br/>\ntaking <br/>\nplace--and also it is a lot more effort than just making up a rule (though <br/>\ncome <br/>\nto think of it it may be less effort than enforcing said rule).  So I am in <br/>\nquite a state of flux and in the middle of integrating a lot of new ideas <br/>\nI&#39;ve <br/>\ngotten here.  <br/>\n***<br/>\nHi Andrea,<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any advice but I wanted to say I totally empathize.  I&#39;m in a <br/>\nvery similar space (sans the 29 yr old older sibling).  I&#39;ve just turned 49 this <br/>\npast March and have a daughter (an only child) who turned 5 in June.  I know <br/>\nthere are at least 3 other &#39;older&#39; moms here with younger children, so I guess <br/>\nwe&#39;ll all grow together on these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole unschooling philosophy resonates so strongly with me, but I&#39;m still <br/>\nworking on actually &#39;living&#39; it and breaking old patterns of looking at <br/>\nthings from how &#39;I&#39; feel, rather than honoring how my DD feels.  I feel like, with <br/>\nthe help of this board, I&#39;m getting better every day, but I still will catch <br/>\nmyself sometime trying to manipulate a situation to end up with me getting what <br/>\n&#39;I&#39; want.  Robyn had a wonderful post about this a couple of days ago where I <br/>\nhad one of those &#39;me, too&#39; moments!<br/>\n<br/>\nA &#39;fear&#39; that I have lately as I&#39;m letting go more and more, is that my DD is <br/>\nbecoming very materialistic but doesn&#39;t really value any of her &#39;things&#39;.

I feel <br/>\nlike she doesn&#39;t care about them after she&#39;s played with them once.  DH says (in <br/>\nprivate) that she&#39;s becoming spoiled and complains that I buy her too many <br/>\nthings, and that she won&#39;t learn the value of &#39;things&#39; if she gets every thing <br/>\nshe wants so readily.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a small house and &quot;I&quot; struggle with all the toys and stuff that is <br/>\nmounting up.  It&#39;s hard to keep up with a very active, curious 5 year old...and <br/>\nI&#39;m admittedly not the greatest housekeeper anyway - LOL!  There are literally <br/>\ntoys, books, crafts, playdough, paints, Polly pocket parts, puzzles, dolls, <br/>\nclothes...well you get the idea...EVERYWHERE on every surface in our house :) <br/>\nThe clutter affects my peacefulness, and I&#39;d love suggestions for countering <br/>\nthe affects.
