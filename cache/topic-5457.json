Every time you try to &quot;get<br/>\nhim&quot; to do something with the point of view that it is necessary academics,<br/>\nyou slide back a ways in the deschooling process. So even though he has been<br/>\nout of school since July, he has probably not completed his process - and if<br/>\nyou are still holding on to schoolish ideas and ideals, then you cannot help<br/>\nbut interfere with it. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  He complains<br/>\nthat we aren;t doing enough fo anything. He feels &quot;let down&quot; in some way by<br/>\nme,.. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWould he be complaining if he was allowed to totally have his choice to<br/>\n&quot;watch movies, read books and play computer games&quot;? If these enjoyable<br/>\nactivities are being limited, or there is a pressure on him from your<br/>\ndisapproval of these things as not valuable enough (compared to math - check<br/>\nthe games he is playing; bet there is tons of math and logic) he may be<br/>\nlooking around at the rest of his time and feeling that it is empty. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever if he is truly free and supported to do all that he really likes<br/>\nwithout qualitative judgments coming from the other folk in his life, then<br/>\nmaybe he will find his days being more full. <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I guess at least he does want to read!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way for you to get a clue to his interests is to notice what he is<br/>\nreading. Maybe there are other related things that you can strew in his path<br/>\nthat spring from those books.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am finding it excruciatingly hard to let go.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep at it, you will get there! Every chance you get to make a choice<br/>\nbetween the controlling option and the less controlling option, choose the<br/>\nlatter - choose to trust. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do a lot of biting my tongue when I am tempted to &quot;direct&quot; Jayn somehow -<br/>\nstill crops up at times. My DH reminds me to trust if I am slipping into<br/>\nthat mode - from being tired, or premenstrual, or distracted. It does take<br/>\npractice to let go and just observe instead of making suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry just reflecting back his feelings to him - commiserating - when he<br/>\nbegins to complain about not being directed by you. &quot;Sounds like you feel a<br/>\nbit bored.&quot; Then just stop - the hardest part is *not* adding &quot;Why don&#39;t you<br/>\n.....&quot; Accept any of his ideas for what he might do next with equanimity. He<br/>\nmight suggest activities he thinks you will approve of (more than movies<br/>\netc). Try &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what you feel like doing.&quot; He might try to test<br/>\nyou by choosing activities he feels you won&#39;t tolerate any more of (more<br/>\ngaming etc.) Try &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what you feel like doing.&quot; Take your own<br/>\nemotions out of the interaction if you can. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really just temporary - for the deschooling/trust building time.<br/>\nEventually you will both be at a point when you can make a suggestion<br/>\nwithout the insidious &quot;sneak in the academics&quot; idea lurking in the<br/>\nbackground of both of your minds to sully your interactions. The real goal<br/>\nis for you to be at a place where he is not *asking permission* to do<br/>\nanything, but *announcing his plans/desires* and requesting any<br/>\nhelp/driving/space/suggestions he may need to accomplish them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can model this also. &quot;I&#39;m going out to the garden for while...I&#39;m going<br/>\nto bake brownies...I&#39;m going to take these sandwiches outside to the patio.<br/>\nWant to come along?&quot;<br/>\n  <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Daniel (11.5 yr old) is lonely, I know he needs more friends around. Hi<br/>\nsbest friend has just moved away.  He doe have activisites with other<br/>\nh/schoolers on a tues and on a friday as regular actitvities,.and he loves<br/>\nthose days.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNeeding friends is another issue from the idea of how he &quot;should&quot; be<br/>\nspending his time, and on what types of activities. Many parents of teens<br/>\nand near teens have reported success by focusing on helping their kids<br/>\npursue their interests with groups or societies founded on the interest,<br/>\nrather than looking for age-peers.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  The rest fo the days he woudl just stay in in pj&#39;s all day. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what?

I already made some suggestions - PMS,<br/>\ntiredness. Others include things like: lack of money, toothache, lousy<br/>\nweather, lack of coffee, upcoming in-laws visit. Etc.....  <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am an unschooler at heart...and I am finding it hard to trust.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust is the heart of Unschooling. I endorse all of Pam&#39;s suggestions about<br/>\nthe reading material.
