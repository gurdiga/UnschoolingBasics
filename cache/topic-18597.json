I have been having a major debate with myself over having my children <br/>\n&gt;around my<br/>\n&gt;sister&#39;s children.  If my sister didn&#39;t have children, I doubt I would even <br/>\n&gt;be around her<br/>\n&gt;myself, as we have never gotten along (as kids) and still don&#39;t.  IMO my <br/>\n&gt;sister is just plain<br/>\n&gt;mean (o.k. she can be very nice sometimes), but the way she is I can see it <br/>\n&gt;is shaping her<br/>\n&gt;children to be just like her.  Her & her dh use all sorts of manipulative <br/>\n&gt;tactics with their<br/>\n&gt;children (bribes, rewards, punishments, shame, guilt, humiliation,ect...).  <br/>\n&gt;Some examples<br/>\n&gt;of her meanness include:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Her children have to finish their dinner before they can have dessert, <br/>\n&gt;well one time we all<br/>\n&gt;went out to a restaurant and her oldest son (5 at the time), wasn&#39;t hungry <br/>\n&gt;(usually doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;eat much because he is a small boy), and as usual she kept threatening him <br/>\n&gt;with no<br/>\n&gt;dessert.  When we got back to my mom&#39;s house to have cake (it was <br/>\n&gt;somebody&#39;s birthday),<br/>\n&gt;he wanted to look at the cake and she said &quot;o.k. you better get a good <br/>\n&gt;look, cause your<br/>\n&gt;not getting any&quot;, which sent him into a total meltdown, and she just laughs <br/>\n&gt;it off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- She has this thing with feet and won&#39;t let any of her kids (or anyone <br/>\n&gt;else&#39;s kids for that<br/>\n&gt;matter) get near her with their &quot;stinky feet&quot;.  One time her son hurt his <br/>\n&gt;foot and asked for<br/>\n&gt;a kiss better on it and she said &quot;I&#39;m not going to kiss your stinky foot&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- One day we were talking on the phone and her kids were being made to <br/>\n&gt;clean their<br/>\n&gt;rooms, I heard her 4  year old come and genuinly askf or her help in <br/>\n&gt;cleaning his room<br/>\n&gt;and she said &quot;no!, you made it messy, you have to clean it up&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- With her 2  year old, instead of picking up things she should be playing <br/>\n&gt;with, she (since<br/>\n&gt;she was 1), puts her in time-out (in her crib or in the playpen) when she <br/>\n&gt;&quot;doesn&#39;t stop<br/>\n&gt;getting into things she shouldn&#39;t be into&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;- Instead of be a role model for her children, she swears a lot in front of <br/>\n&gt;them and<br/>\n&gt;badmouths people and then if they do it she threatens them and has even <br/>\n&gt;&quot;washed their<br/>\n&gt;mouths out with soap&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sorry this is turning into a big rant about my sister, my question is this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Her two sons (7 & 4) are to the point of actually starting to bully my son <br/>\n&gt;(4).  They fight<br/>\n&gt;and wrestle a lot together and my son has never liked it, he used to just <br/>\n&gt;leave when they<br/>\n&gt;would start doing it and they always would try to include him, but now my <br/>\n&gt;son is starting<br/>\n&gt;to fight back saying that &quot;I am just defending myself&quot;.  We never get <br/>\n&gt;together with just the<br/>\n&gt;two families, the only time we get together is at my moms house with her <br/>\n&gt;initiating it.  Her<br/>\n&gt;sons will hit my son and then if my son hits or kicks back they come and <br/>\n&gt;tattle on him, so<br/>\n&gt;lately i&#39;ve tried to be there 100% of the time, so he doesn&#39;t get blamed <br/>\n&gt;for starting<br/>\n&gt;something.

I didn&#39;t even know Holden (her ds) was at my house.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Did you tell them to stay away from the water?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Of coarse.&quot;  (There had been a bunch of gator attacks this summer so all the kids had been told to stay away from the water just in case a gator moved in.)  Where are they?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;They are out in the pasture with Bria!&quot; (Our sweetest of sweet throughbred the boys have been around since their birth.)<br/>\n&quot;Are they near the water?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No!, but they shouldn&#39;t be near the horse!&quot;<br/>\nAnyway, she just kept screaming at me, then she went and screamed at my dh.  He apologized trying to calm her.  Neither of us could figure out what she was ranting about, as the boys have played out there for years now.  Long story short, we no longer see them as she feels we are unfit parents and continues to be insultive.  My son morns the loss of his best friend and cousin but  what can we do until she decides to return to her senses.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a note:  Holden was practically raised by me and grew up on our farm.
