Even if you&#39;re on the fence and *might* come, I&#39;d suggest at least <br/>\ngetting a room booked. You can always cancel the room at the last <br/>\nminute. The regular hotel rates are HIGH (this is a NICE hotel!), and <br/>\nthere&#39;s nothing I can do about the rate after the 6th!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference is $350 for the whole family for Wednesday evening <br/>\nthrough Sunday afternoon. OR $110 per adult and $75 per child. The <br/>\nfamily deal works best if there are four or more family members coming. <br/>\nPrice jumps up considerably after August 10th, with no family discount. <br/>\nFor more info:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html\">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/registration.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDozens of funshops and speakers and just great things to do and people <br/>\nto meet.
