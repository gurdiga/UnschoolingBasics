I do think pin pointing what I need<br/>\nwhen I am grumpy is a good idea but my husband works alot at night so<br/>\nI will have to work around that. I have tried bringing the three year<br/>\nold upstairs into my bed and watching tv. She is a chatter box though<br/>\nand ends up waking me which in turn makes me more cranky. Any ideas<br/>\nfor this?<br/>\n   We do have a bedtime ritual and she generally is in bed by 9:00 but<br/>\nsometimes earlier if she hasn&#39;t napped for a few days in a row. My<br/>\nother two are fine for the most part at night. During the day my<br/>\ncrankiness comes out when they are fighting with each other and I am<br/>\ntired.<br/>\n    Thanks for sharing all your bedtime stories!!<br/>\nDanette</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5950,"nextTopicId":5958}}
