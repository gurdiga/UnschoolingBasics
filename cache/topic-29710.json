However, I am <br/>\nalways present when these situations come up, so I would really like <br/>\nto help him understand that it&#39;s not his job to convince them of <br/>\nanything.  It&#39;s like he has no faith in my parenting abilities, or at <br/>\nleast it feels that way to me.  Some of it could be the fact that his <br/>\nsiblings do things that he used to get in trouble for when he was <br/>\nlittle (roll on the floor, etc.).

My twin 3 year olds fight a *lot*.  They want space too which we try to give them in the evening when there&#39;s more than one adult here.  I know when there is a lot of confict between my girls (it goes in spurts for sure) I feel my old controlling self rearing its&#39; ugly head.  I want them to just stop fighting and listen to me, dammit! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I&#39;ve noticed often lately, since dh and I are also working through lots of stuff  (and so am I personally) that when there is intense emotion, shifts, etc. moving through me (and I don&#39;t have the luxury in that moment of going off by myself to sit by the water with my journal!), that is a time I have to really be conscious that the frustration and anger and impatience is all about what&#39;s going on inside me and not with my kids.  This helps immensely for me not to blow up at them.  I had some bodywork done on the weekend, and I was very aware that Monday and Tuesday I was having a very challenging time just being with their unpredictable, boisterous, power-struggling little selves.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  A person close to me recommended that I &quot;breathe & pray&quot; in those moments.  Yes, I am unable to find solitude (which I *love*), and self-care doesn&#39;t presently look anything like what it did pre-children, but I can always, in that moment, just breathe and pray.  I pray to the universe, I pray to my higher power, I pray to nature, I pray to my children, I pray to whatever I&#39;m moved to pray to in that moment.  And it&#39;s working.  Thank god.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  So for what it&#39;s worth, that&#39;s what is working for me!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi <br/>\n                        <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
