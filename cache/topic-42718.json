Vacation sounds fun, but it can also allay any kind of worries of &quot;but how will I learn&quot; in a child who has been told (as most are) that &quot;education&quot; is how they learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he asks &quot;how long&quot; the vacation will be, that&#39;s a good time to talk about learning and motivation and also about deschooling - how he needs time to unlearn the bad habits of &quot;being taught&quot;. He&#39;ll know he&#39;s done deschooling when *he* no longer divides his life into &quot;school/learning&quot; and &quot;fun&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut a shorter answer could be &quot;as long as we want&quot; if he&#39;s not the type for big, long explanations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Also, when he asks me, as we&#39;re doing some activity, &quot;Is this school?&quot;  what do I say?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, is this not as much fun as I/you/we thought it would be? we can do something else.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s asking that a lot, you may be filling up too much of his time with &quot;activities&quot;. Kids can need a good bit of &quot;down time&quot; when deschooling, even from homeschool - sometimes especially from homeschool if they&#39;ve gotten used to a &quot;learning moment&quot; concealed behind every chocolate chip and game. Keep the vacation analogy in mind - what would you do if you had a nice long vacation to do Whatever you wanted? Do some fun stuff, just because. This is My last weekend of vacation from work, and I&#39;ve spend most of it watching tv with Mo, curled up on the bed enjoying each others company. That&#39;s a big part of unschooling, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240838916,"authorName":"Hael","from":"&quot;Hael&quot; &lt;dlmckee@...&gt;","profile":"hael_harobed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"How to talk with new unschooler about what we&#39;re doing","postDate":"1262468643","msgId":42718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhob2VuMytqNzVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42733,"prevInTime":42717,"nextInTime":42719,"topicId":42718,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 9-year-old step-son has been homeschooled by his grandmother (Gram) for 4 years, since he started school.
