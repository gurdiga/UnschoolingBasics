Asking my older boys to finish their skittles outside is <br/>\n&gt; about <br/>\n&gt; courtesy and principles and thinking of their little brother&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; best <br/>\n&gt; interests.

It seems like maybe it&#39;s the prospect of being forced to <br/>\n&gt; eat, <br/>\n&gt; but maybe I&#39;m missing a part of the puzzle.  Why would seeing a <br/>\n&gt; meal <br/>\n&gt; put on the table and deciding not to eat it make a person turn <br/>\n&gt; blue <br/>\n&gt; and white and throw up?.  Other than a long time power struggle?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; We worked with it for years and years.  His move to only <br/>\n&gt; processed <br/>\n&gt; foods was a gradual thing but that was where he was when things <br/>\n&gt; got <br/>\n&gt; really bad.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So what you seem to be saying is that *after* you worked on his <br/>\n&gt; diet <br/>\n&gt; for &quot;years and years&quot; he THEN eventually moved to the processed <br/>\n&gt; sugar only diet that caused the malnutrition?  In another post you <br/>\n&gt; seemed to imply that it was the radical unschooling advice you <br/>\n&gt; followed that resulted in the malnutrition.  Is it possible that <br/>\n&gt; his <br/>\n&gt; eventual problems were in response to the &quot;working with&quot; more than <br/>\n&gt; to the freedom?  Or perhaps a deadly combination of the two?  <br/>\n&gt; (Power <br/>\n&gt; struggle/guilt over choices combined with an unlimited supply of <br/>\n&gt; the <br/>\n&gt; very foods he knew you didn&#39;t want him to eat?) <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an unschool-related post that <br/>\n&gt; suggested &quot;no limits&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Really???

I posted about Zach after someone (I think Patty) informed a poster that kids wouldn&#39;t eat all the halloween candy to the point of not feeling well if they had other choices.  I simply posted that my son would.  That not all kids fall into that category of kids that Patty has experience with.  I just brought it up to remind people that even with the best of intentions, with what we think are the best ideals of parenting, there can be huge bumps in the road that no one was expecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not going to post about Zach anymore because he isn&#39;t some kind of freak, he&#39;s a 12 yo boy who is struggling, and I&#39;m not some controlling wigged-out mom, just somebody trying to keep her kid healthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, November 9, 2005 8:46 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] A few issues<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;&lt;&lt;I would have had no problem not stocking my pantry with process <br/>\n&gt; food&gt;&gt;&quot;<br/>\n&gt; ~So we only trust our children as long as they are living within <br/>\n&gt; certainboundaries? Where is the boundary? Attempting to keep our <br/>\n&gt; kids away from<br/>\n&gt; things is imposing limits. They may be rather vague but that is what<br/>\n&gt; they are.~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course we only trust our children within certain boundaries!! It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; called safety and child development!! I&#39;ve NEVER heard anyone at any<br/>\n&gt; list say NO limits, NO boundaries...ever.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s a very different thing than saying that we want to act in a<br/>\n&gt; non-coercive manner and let them have choices and freedom.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am VERY coercive when Jalen chooses to walk towards a busy street,<br/>\n&gt; or jump up on a rail that&#39;s two stories up. Heck yes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Attempting to keep our children safe is parental duty, of course it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; imposting limits, but they&#39;re real life limits, with REAL<br/>\n&gt; reasons...not some arbitrary thing that isn&#39;t considered carefully.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a huge problem with ALL the people in the household being<br/>\n&gt; forced to eat a certain way over one child&#39;s issues.<br/>\n&gt; I would not do that. If you keep certain things out of the house, I<br/>\n&gt; understand...but to force a certain diet on everyone is not fair, nor<br/>\n&gt; is it the best way to help people learn to listen to their own bodies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There are several inconsistencies I don&#39;t understand.<br/>\n&gt; First of all, you&#39;re saying this child was being given the foods he<br/>\n&gt; was craving in a processed version?<br/>\n&gt; Why would he choose a cookie in a wrapper vs. a cookie on the counter?<br/>\n&gt; Why would a child choose anything in a wrapper if they have the same<br/>\n&gt; food available right in front of them?<br/>\n&gt; That is not a food issue any longer, it&#39;s a control issue.<br/>\n&gt; He is trying to gain control for some reason, because he knows you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t want him to eat those foods.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a feeling there was WAY too much food focus and too much focus<br/>\n&gt; on what this child was eating at some point in his life. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; wrong...but regardless of some people choosing unhealthy foods a lot,<br/>\n&gt; this child seems to choose what YOU donn&#39;t want him to eat.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I DO believe there are people who will eat mostly sweets and if<br/>\n&gt; processed food is the easiest choice then they&#39;ll eat that almost<br/>\n&gt; exclusively. I have a child like that!!<br/>\n&gt; But if there are cookies laying on the counter, he&#39;ll eat those as<br/>\n&gt; opposed to rummaging through the cupboards to find a wrapped <br/>\n&gt; cookie! <br/>\n&gt; Just looking at general human behavior, they go for the easiest food<br/>\n&gt; that tastes good available. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Forcing him to finish his food is only setting him up for HUGE control<br/>\n&gt; issues. I totally disagree with this, you can claim he is unique all<br/>\n&gt; you want and I think that&#39;s a huge mistake.<br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re better off putting liquid vitamins in the drinks he loves than<br/>\n&gt; making an issue of forcing him to eat.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s abuse of another human&#39;s spirit.<br/>\n&gt; If he&#39;s really going to starve himself if you don&#39;t do that, then<br/>\n&gt; there MUST be a physical issue that hasn&#39;t been addressed.<br/>\n&gt; Everything I&#39;ve read so far is telling me it&#39;s  a control issue <br/>\n&gt; though.<br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

It is just the way Zach is.  I didn&#39;t do anything to MAKE him this way.  I truly don&#39;t think he is CHOOSING to be this way.

It isn&#39;t a huge issue to me but it was/is a problem for the kids.  So I am imposing a limit.  My choosing not to buy that does limit them.  To act as though that isn&#39;t a limit is not an honest portrayal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;seeing what they need is more important than ANY list or ANY advice&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely agree with this.  I was a crappy mom in that I kept thinking somewhere this self-regulation is going to kick in.  But it was a gradual thing, Zach has been very tiny all his life except in infancy when I was pretty much in charge of what he ate and when.  He just kept getting skinnier and skinnier.  Doctors said nothing was physically wrong with him, people kept telling me he was losing his baby fat, my other kids self-regulated.  And unschooling lists kept telling me that what I was seeing was wrong, that it couldn&#39;t possibly happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I have talked about Zach on the boards, the more I have been contacted by people who have kids like him.  I truly believe that there is a small percentage of kids who will learn to self-regulate only in very gradual, very restricted (from an unschooling point of view) manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Zach better able to control himself than he used to be? yes.  Does he have the capacity to eat what will maintain his health?  Not yet.  I hope to be able to give up the role of food Nazi some day but we aren&#39;t there yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;but when someone tells me they allowed their son to become malnourished because they chose ONLY processed foods it doesn&#39;t paint the picture your second post did&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?  People choose to eat in a manner that makes them fat quite frequently.  Problem is that it is much more difficult to diagnose malnutrition in fat people.  I was never restricted in my eating in any way, shape or form as a child but while not obese, I am certainly not at an ideal weight for me.  Zach simply took it to extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Tuesday, November 8, 2005 9:10 am<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] A few issues<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &quot;<br/>\n&gt; All the kids are different.
