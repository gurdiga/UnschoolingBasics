I don&#39;t think good intentions are any part of this show.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I actually think that the woman who had her baby (I think the babies name was Ata) and then her toddler son (can&#39;t remember his name) on the show both weeks breastfeeds. I swear (and I may be wrong) that she was nursing Ata when she was talking to the teens at the end of the show. She also carried her in the beginning IN a sling. My first comment was if that baby is used to being attached to Mom or Dad it is going to be SO much harder. I honestly don&#39;t see how a typical attached baby COULD be on this show. My baby would have been HORRIBLE and she was typically quite easy for my standard (which is holding her all the time anyway). <br/>\nMy biggest problem with this show is the fact that it does NOT give teens a good overall look at what being a parent is like. I am sorry but you can NOT know what being a parent is like until you are one. Other people&#39;s kids are NOT your baby. At 6-18 months a baby has already bonded completely with their parents, they have exact needs and wants. Most babies like things done a certain way usually by their parent. I don&#39;t think watching someone else&#39;s child shows you how it will be with your own child someday. My child was so easy for my husband and I, and yet I am sure she would have been difficult for anyone else. <br/>\nOlder children might be easier to give you an opinion on parenting them, but I agree that giving teens, other teens is ridiculous. <br/>\nI can&#39;t imagine any amount of money being enough to let me give over my child. I don&#39;t care if I am next door and there is a nanny there. I personally believe an infant should be with a parent, but I know many parents are okay with their babies staying other places so this wouldn&#39;t be a far stretch I am sure. Especially when they can &quot;say&quot; it is for the &quot;education&quot; of these teens. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Horrible Show called &quot;Baby Borrowers&quot;","postDate":"1215787659","msgId":34490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc1N3JxYitkOTVsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3ZTkxOWI2MDgwNzEwMjEyNnM1YjhmNTk1NWtkZmQ2YjFhMjE4ZGI0MzU2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34487,"nextInTopic":34508,"prevInTime":34489,"nextInTime":34491,"topicId":34465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Last night I caught the two first episodes with the babies on WE network...

I wanted to give it my honest opinion since I hadn&#39;t seen<br/>\nthose episodes and someone had said they didn&#39;t find it as<br/>\nobjectionable as I had found the toddler one.   <br/>\nWELL... I found that episode even more horrible!   Who lets someone<br/>\nelse &quot;borrow&quot; their 6 month old infant for 3 days??   I found it<br/>\nincredible that it seemed that not one of those babies was<br/>\nbreastfed!!!  Some were older babies but still I was shocked enough<br/>\nthat not one of the 2 and not quite two yr old were nursing but that<br/>\nall those babies were having bottles and formula really bothered me. <br/>\nNot to mention the parents as they sat and watched and one commented<br/>\n&quot;OH if you hold him he will NEVER go to sleep&quot;  and another that said<br/>\n&quot; he usually sleeps until about 7am but we let him stay in the crib a<br/>\nwhile longer after he wakes up&quot;  The parents also gave a short<br/>\nstatement of why they allowed their baby to be part of the show.. most<br/>\nwere along the lines of &quot;not many people get a chance to try before<br/>\nyou buy, parenting is hard and people might not jump into it if they<br/>\nknew how hard it is&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to say that as shocking as I find the parents of the<br/>\nbabies and that whole concept the thing as it relates to unschooling<br/>\nthat bothers me the most is the premise of the show.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHow disrespectful is it to base a show(or anything )  on PROVING to<br/>\nsomeone else that they are incapable of something??   Is the idea to<br/>\nprove to teens that not a single one of them could EVER step up to the<br/>\nplate and be a good parent should they have an unplanned pregnancy?? <br/>\n What does some teen girl who finds herself pregnant do after being<br/>\npart of this show or watching this show??  Give her baby away or have<br/>\nan abortion just based on a tv show that clearly proved that teens are<br/>\nincapable of parenting???  I do know some folks that were teen parents<br/>\nand most of them stepped up to the plate and are great parents... I<br/>\nknow a few teens currently that are parents and are doing a good<br/>\njob... they know it&#39;s hard but they are doing their best and raising<br/>\nloved children.   Most are doing a better job than alot of parents I<br/>\nknow that planned to have children and should be mature enough and<br/>\n&quot;settled&quot; enough to do a good job but aren&#39;t! <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would we like it if our spouse or other family member set out to<br/>\nprove to us that we were incapable of something... how loved and<br/>\nrespected would we feel??<br/>\n<br/>\nYes the show does show how hard it is... but it&#39;s not very realistic<br/>\n... the first episode they were supposed to wear a pregnancy belly for<br/>\n3 days and one girl refused because her boyfriend laughed at her and<br/>\nshe didn&#39;t want anyone to see her like that.   Another of the girls<br/>\nrefused to take care of the baby after the mother came over and<br/>\ncorrected her regarding feeding the baby and left all the care to the<br/>\nboyfriend.   And I don&#39;t get why they are going to have teens parent<br/>\npreteens, teens and take care of elderly folks.   If it&#39;s in the<br/>\nprocess of parenting is hard for teens wouldn&#39;t it be absurd that a<br/>\nteen would parent a preteen or another teen?   If you had a baby as a<br/>\nteen when the child was a preteen and teen you would be older etc...<br/>\nthat part I didn&#39;t get but perhaps I am missing some part of the<br/>\npremise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are redeeming parts of the show... some of the parents are<br/>\ngiving the teens pretty good advice and encouragement but it would<br/>\nseem to be a better idea to have a teen shadow a parent for a period<br/>\nof time rather than put a baby through being handed over to a<br/>\ninexperienced stranger who is given only a notebook user&#39;s manual all<br/>\nin the name of a social experiment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI found it interesting also that when the teen&#39;s parents were allowed<br/>\na short visit most of them had poor relationships and were barely<br/>\nspeaking.   A few (who were some of the teens that did best with the<br/>\nchildren) had good positive parents but most were just there to say &quot;I<br/>\ntold you so&quot;.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI just find it sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Blocker</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"&quot;Faith Void&quot; &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Horrible Show called &quot;Baby Borrowers&quot;","postDate":"1215779225","msgId":34487,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDgwNzExMDUyN3QyZGU1YjJhNXQxNGE0NmE1YTNlNzU4ODA0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg3ZTkxOWI2MDgwNzEwMjEyNnM1YjhmNTk1NWtkZmQ2YjFhMjE4ZGI0MzU2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc1NmFhcitmcThlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZzU2bXY2KzhuMjZAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CSA8ODdlOTE5YjYwODA3MTAyMTI2czViOGY1OTU1a2RmZDZiMWEyMThkYjQzNTZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34484,"nextInTopic":34490,"prevInTime":34486,"nextInTime":34488,"topicId":34465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It would be nice if they had a show that showed how it is hard work to care for another human that is totally dependent on you but that it is rewarding.

When I <br/>\nfirst heard about it I was freaked out by it but I can see they did <br/>\neverything they could for it to be as positve an experience as <br/>\npossible for the children and parents.   The parents can go over at <br/>\nany time I can&#39;t imagine why the parents of the crying child didn&#39;t <br/>\ndo that.  Last week with the babies parents went over several times <br/>\neither to give the teens advice or  settle their babies down a bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLiz and I are watching the show together at her request so I <br/>\nrecorded it and will watch it next week sometime when she&#39;s home.  <br/>\nLiz loves kids and has a special gift with them.  Although she knows <br/>\nshe wants to have a bunch of little unschoolers running around one <br/>\nday she also knows she&#39;s not ready anytime soon.   It didn&#39;t take a <br/>\ntv show for her to know that but she&#39;s finding it interesting to see <br/>\nhow typical kids from various backrounds are adapting to the <br/>\nexpereince.   It&#39;s led to some good conversations for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Last night I was flipping channels and came upon this show called<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Baby Borrowers&quot;  the title caught my eye and I hung around through<br/>\n&gt; the commercials to see what it was all about.
