It&#39;s a <br/>\nrather pleasant humidity, with balmy 75 degree days and cooler 55-60 <br/>\ndegree nights (typically).<br/>\nBugs are a non-issue at the beach, where the conference will be <br/>\nheld. I&#39;ve never been bit by a mosquito down there. Now my backyard <br/>\nwith the marsh behind it? That&#39;s a different story.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, the conference is held indoors, with AC!! No humidity <br/>\nthere. I guess even October would seem humid to a guy that likes <br/>\ndesert DRY...yucky for me. His skin will look a lot nicer <br/>\nhere...yeah, tell him that, I bet that would sell a guy. lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, there aren&#39;t many places in the world I&#39;d rather be <br/>\nin October, than Pensacola FL. The weather is SO ideal and the ocean <br/>\nstill swimable. There&#39;s a lot to do and the beaches here are SO nice.<br/>\nIf the conference itself can&#39;t overcome his hesitations though, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what else to say. Meeting over 300 unschoolers is reason <br/>\nenough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1922,"nextTopicId":1892}}
