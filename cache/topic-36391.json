I was sort of joking about having no bean dip<br/>\naround, but I do have a hard time jumping to another topic that is not<br/>\nfluid. I just need to have SOMETHING in the back of my mind to SAY for a<br/>\nwhile, then it will become easier to think of ANYthing that changes the<br/>\nsubject. Speaking of changing the subject, I can do this very successful<br/>\nwith this one friend Jen (works like the Jedi mind trick!); it is actually<br/>\npretty amazing that it works so well on her! But it does not work on Lily,<br/>\nthe friend I&#39;ve been talking about. She will change the subject back if<br/>\nshe&#39;s not done or bring it up again later.<br/>\n <br/>\nOne day Jen and Lily were going off on me about why my son is not vaccinated<br/>\nand how critically important for society it is for all kisd to have their<br/>\nshots. Jen is a nurse and Lily is a public school teacher and both claim to<br/>\nknow first hand what certain diseases can do to children. (Lily is actually<br/>\na special ed teacher and I would hope she would realize what vaccines have<br/>\ndone to some of those kids!!) But with both of them going on and on about<br/>\nherd immunity I glazed over and then reached into my bag to pull out some<br/>\npapers and said OH, I need to tell you guys about this! (something to do<br/>\nwith my sale, I do a seasonal consignment sale for those who don&#39;t know) and<br/>\nthe subject was changed for good. They did not revisit later, I kept them<br/>\noccupied on the details of the sale (both help me with planning and<br/>\nexecution of the sale). <br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe<br/>\nwww.passitonsales.com<br/>\nin case anyone doesn&#39;t know what a consignment sale is!

I&#39;ve been mulling over the phrase &quot;you might be right.&quot;<br/>\nHow perfect to end an arguement or nip it before it gets started. I love the<br/>\nbean dip post, but have not been able to adapt it to my situation wherever<br/>\nwe are, (like if there is no bean dip, then what? pass me a napkin? is there<br/>\nanother good phrase?). <br/>\n <br/>\nI think my friend just likes to argue lately! She just had a baby 2 mos ago<br/>\nand has not been herself since. Her husband is NOT helping at all with the<br/>\nbaby or the 3yr old and that is taking it&#39;s toll on her. I have also been<br/>\nthinking a LOT about what has been said about losing friendships along the<br/>\nway and although I do not want to lose this particular friend just yet<br/>\n(we&#39;ve come a long way together, she is now using cloth diapers on her 2nd<br/>\nbaby and has read the Dr Sears Baby Book, which in my mind is a step in the<br/>\ngentler direction!), I do see where our parenting styles differ and it is so<br/>\nhard. We used to watch each other&#39;s kids in trade, but not so much now. I<br/>\nkind of stopped asking after I found out she made my son sit in a time out<br/>\non the stairs when both boys were fighting over a toy at her house. I sent<br/>\nher articles to read about the effects of TOs, and she almost stopped<br/>\ntalking to me. She replied with an email saying how she was doing the best<br/>\nshe knew how and then listing things she thought I did that were wrong (she<br/>\ntook it as a slam on her parenting style, not as something to consider and<br/>\nlearn from!). But this was right before we went on vacation for a week then<br/>\nshe had her baby so things changed, and we have not really discussed the TO<br/>\nthing or what happened afterwards.<br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I hope to influence her in a positive way through our friendship,<br/>\nbut it does get harder and harder to watch the way her husband treats their<br/>\n3 yr old and to see my son dread her son coming over. Her 3yr old really<br/>\nlooks up to my 4yr old, but they always seem to fight, and since the other<br/>\nkid started walking, he was quite a clutz and every time he visited he would<br/>\nbreak a toy usually by stepping on it. Plus we have some toys like a marble<br/>\ntower kit that my son is gentle with but is NOT suitable for young clutzy<br/>\nkids that he always wants to play with and breaks pieces to. So my son<br/>\nstarted saying he didn&#39;t want this kid to come over because he always breaks<br/>\nhis toys (I did not instigate him saying this), and we started trying to put<br/>\nhis favorite things away when we knew Bill was coming over so he couldn&#39;t<br/>\nstep on them, but it&#39;s kind of sad that we had to do that! And this kid<br/>\nwould ransack the house anyway and find the coolest toy and my son would cry<br/>\njust out of fear he would destroy it.<br/>\n <br/>\nShe is also having problems with us. When we go out to dinner in particular,<br/>\nit is a strain on their family, especially if her husband goes. He yells at<br/>\ntheir kid to stay in his seat, eat this, drink that, pick up a fork, put<br/>\nthat down, stop whining, you name it. One time we were walking up to IHOP<br/>\nand my son got up on a wall (which he does every time we go there) and<br/>\nwalked all the way across the top of this brick wall (3ft off ground,<br/>\nrestaurant is at top level) and her son followed and she yelled for him to<br/>\nstop, then ran over and yanked his arm, yelling because he didn&#39;t listen to<br/>\nher, and dragged him in to the place. Meanwhile I said nothing to my son (he<br/>\nwas ahead of us and I saw no problem with it) and I guess she wanted me to<br/>\ndo the same. I ignored it, but the same thing happened as we left, my son<br/>\nwent back to the wall to walk along on it to the parking lot. Again I had no<br/>\nproblem with this, but she freaked out and dragged her son to the car. My<br/>\nson stopped and asked why Bill was in trouble. I just said, &quot;his mom was<br/>\nworried about him following you because she doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s ready to walk<br/>\nalong a wall by himself without holding her hand. He doesn&#39;t have good<br/>\nbalance and he might fall. I don&#39;t worry about you because you have<br/>\nexcellent balance (totally true!) and you never fall. Just remember he is<br/>\nyounger than you and can&#39;t do everything you can do, so be careful where you<br/>\nlead him.&quot; <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess I assume my son appreciates when I talk to him like that. Like he is<br/>\na person worthy of consideration and a conversation. Not just someone who<br/>\ngets yanked around by the arm and told not to do things.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I should see this disconnect and stop having them over, right?! But<br/>\nthis is one of my best friends. Otherwise we&#39;d have moved on by now. I don&#39;t<br/>\neven know why she means so much to me, she just does! I&#39;ve been trying to<br/>\nmeet up at outside places more, that way the toys are neutral. I do see the<br/>\nboys growing apart over the next few years, once Bill goes to school for<br/>\nsure. <br/>\n <br/>\nBottom line is that while I do not want to bail on this friendship, I DO<br/>\nneed to find my son some more suitable friends!!! That is my goal this<br/>\nmonth. :) I have 2 outings planned for next week, Wed & Fri, with other<br/>\nunschoolers. Even though the outings are far from our town, I feel it will<br/>\nbe good for us to see how other US kids are. <br/>\n <br/>\nHow&#39;s it going with the in-laws??

She<br/>\nthinks violent video games and movies have ratings for a reason and too many<br/>\nparents ignore them.~~<br/>\n <br/>\nBlah blah blah &lt;g&gt;.  This really applies only to parents and kids who spend<br/>\nwaaaaay not enough time together and aren&#39;t very connected.  A paradigm that<br/>\napplies to schooled and not-mindfully-parented kids really doesn&#39;t apply to<br/>\nunschooled and mindfully parented kids.  Someone has come along and decided<br/>\nthat such and such an age shouldn&#39;t watch such and such a movie.  It&#39;s just<br/>\nanother set of rules that have been set for the benefit of the parents, in<br/>\nthe name of it being &#39;for their own good&#39;.  Makes me gag quite frankly.  So<br/>\neasy in the moment to say, &#39;that&#39;s the rule&#39;, or &#39;because I said so&#39;, and<br/>\nyet it can be so damaging to my relationship with my kids.  It makes so much<br/>\nmore sense to me to operate on a case-by-case/kid-by-kid/moment-by-moment<br/>\nbasis within my family<br/>\n <br/>\n~~She told me that my son has violent tendencies from things we have exposed<br/>\nhim to. He copies things he sees in movies. My friend told me that my son<br/>\nwas using a tape measure as a whip the other day when we were all at a<br/>\nbirthday party for a 2 yr old. (He was pretending to be Indy, chasing the<br/>\nbirthday girl with a whip. Now, do I also need to mention my friend&#39;s son<br/>\nwas part of the chase as well?) I did not see this and she said<br/>\nshe had to take it away from him. We talked later about how Indiana does not<br/>\nuse his whip on PEOPLE, only to get him out of sticky situations. (I would<br/>\nhave talked with him on the spot if I had known about the tape measure<br/>\nwhip.) I&#39;m sure it was handled without sensitivity.~~<br/>\n <br/>\nTo me, another big difference is that we as mindful parents and unschoolers<br/>\nhave made the committment to take the time with our kids to find solutions<br/>\nthat respect all family members involved because we know it&#39;s a better way.<br/>\nOf course he copies things he sees in movies!  It&#39;s really does take more<br/>\nthought, more consideration, more trust, more compromise, more conversation,<br/>\nmore time, to be available to work things out with our kids in a respectful<br/>\nmanner.  I had lots of conversations with people when we first started down<br/>\nthis path that I wouldn&#39;t even engage in now.  Reminds of Kelly&#39;s line that<br/>\ngoes something like, &#39;how interesting, please pass the bean dip&#39;.  My new<br/>\none is &#39;you may be right&#39;.

We discuss the<br/>\n&gt; violence they<br/>\n&gt; see and why the decision was made to act in that manner. If my dd when she<br/>\n&gt; was 2<br/>\n&gt; thought she wanted to see the Terminator movies I would have to discuss<br/>\n&gt; that with her. I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t just sit her down in front of the movie and say *enjoy*. She is<br/>\n&gt; extremely sensitive<br/>\n&gt; to violence, death, murder....that would be wrong of me to not give her the<br/>\n&gt; facts so she<br/>\n&gt; could make a decision that wouldn&#39;t hamper her ability to sleep. She still<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t like scary<br/>\n&gt; movies (I love them) but I would never make her watch. She loves Dr. Who,<br/>\n&gt; but even then<br/>\n&gt; there are times when it is too much for her. The boys on the other hand can<br/>\n&gt; watch and<br/>\n&gt; enjoy Dr. Who or Spiderman and not have issues. Knowing the sensitivities<br/>\n&gt; and that she<br/>\n&gt; has said she doesn&#39;t wish to watch anything like that helps me help her<br/>\n&gt; when she asks<br/>\n&gt; about certain movies. The key is discussion. To talk about what happens in<br/>\n&gt; these movies<br/>\n&gt; and let them decide when and if they are ready to watch them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My eldest LOVES Jurrasic Park and my dd wants to watch it, but only the<br/>\n&gt; fun/happy parts.<br/>\n&gt; So she will watch till her brother says ok scary part coming and then<br/>\n&gt; either hide her face<br/>\n&gt; or leave the room. We went to the new Indy Jones and she spent at least 60%<br/>\n&gt; of the movie<br/>\n&gt; with her ears covered and her face in daddy&#39;s arm. She didn&#39;t mind having<br/>\n&gt; to do that, she<br/>\n&gt; new we wanted to see it. And she enjoyed the parts she watched. She just<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t prefer<br/>\n&gt; movies like that. Although she LOVED the Nancy Drew movie....but the spooky<br/>\n&gt; parts were<br/>\n&gt; limited.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Anywhoo, sorry to babble. I really think discussion, and being there for<br/>\n&gt; our kids is what it<br/>\n&gt; boils down too. I understand the worries the other non-unschoolers have,<br/>\n&gt; but I agree it<br/>\n&gt; was mostly neglected schooled kids who have the issues. We aren&#39;t beyond<br/>\n&gt; having our dd<br/>\n&gt; snuggle or sleep with us when she has seen something she didn&#39;t want to or<br/>\n&gt; worried/scared her.

If my dd when she was 2 <br/>\nthought she wanted to see the Terminator movies I would have to discuss that with her.  I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t just sit her down in front of the movie and say *enjoy*.  She is extremely sensitive <br/>\nto violence, death, murder....that would be wrong of me to not give her the facts so she <br/>\ncould make a decision that wouldn&#39;t hamper her ability to sleep.  She still doesn&#39;t like scary  <br/>\nmovies (I love them) but I would never make her watch.  She loves Dr. Who, but even then <br/>\nthere are times when it is too much for her.  The boys on the other hand can watch and <br/>\nenjoy Dr. Who or Spiderman and not have issues.  Knowing the sensitivities and that she <br/>\nhas said she doesn&#39;t wish to watch anything like that helps me help her when she asks <br/>\nabout certain movies.  The key is discussion.  To talk about what happens in these movies <br/>\nand let them decide when and if they are ready to watch them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy eldest LOVES Jurrasic Park and my dd wants to watch it, but only the fun/happy parts.  <br/>\nSo she will watch till her brother says ok scary part coming and then either hide her face <br/>\nor leave the room.  We went to the new Indy Jones and she spent at least 60% of the movie <br/>\nwith her ears covered and her face in daddy&#39;s arm.  She didn&#39;t mind having to do that, she <br/>\nnew we wanted to see it.  And she enjoyed the parts she watched.  She just doesn&#39;t prefer <br/>\nmovies like that.  Although she LOVED the Nancy Drew movie....but the spooky parts were <br/>\nlimited.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywhoo, sorry to babble.  I really think discussion, and being there for our kids is what it <br/>\nboils down too.  I understand the worries the other non-unschoolers have, but I agree it <br/>\nwas mostly neglected schooled kids who have the issues.  We aren&#39;t beyond having our dd <br/>\nsnuggle or sleep with us when she has seen something she didn&#39;t want to or <br/>\nworried/scared her.  All part of being parents...all part of being a family...<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks for the discussion! :)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~She is a middle school teacher and feels that children are exposed to too much<br/>\n&gt; violence and they can&#39;t process or handle it in the same way adults can.

Killing Monsters: Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and <br/>\nMake- Believe Violence: Gerard Jones,<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom -- I&#39;m Learning! Marc Prensky (i haven&#39;t read <br/>\nthis yet, but it sounds good and will eventually get to it)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont&#39; believe in all those ratings. My son censor his own <br/>\nwatchings. He decides what&#39;s scary and what&#39;s not. In Asia, we watch <br/>\nanything and everything at any age. And we have proven to the world <br/>\nwe&#39;re a civilised and advance continent, not barbarians. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; their brains are not developed in such a way that they can process <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what they are seeing and make sense of things in reality and how <br/>\nthey relate to the real world). <br/>\n<br/>\nHow would anyone knows when our brains is ready for anything? Would <br/>\nour kid be violent because he&#39;s just seen the coyote tried to kill <br/>\nthe roadrunner with a big bunch of dynamites? Or maybe try to hit <br/>\nhimself with a hammer because he&#39;s just watch Jerry hit Tom&#39;s tail <br/>\nwith a hammer? Our children have what you&#39;ll call common sense. This <br/>\nis where an involve parent will have the opportunity to speak to the <br/>\nchild if the child is unsure of what he&#39;s just saw- because the <br/>\nchild trust us enough to come to us for advice/ opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow what&#39;s the difference between the violence in Loony Toons and <br/>\nthe violence in all these other rated movies?  Does animation and <br/>\nfunny creatures makes it not violent? <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if you look carefully Tom and Jerry is actually a very <br/>\nviolent show. Or Powder Puff Girls or Tweety Bird and Slyvester. <br/>\nIt&#39;s all to kill or be killed. Or get blown up.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;People keep telling me that kids who are exposed to violence become <br/>\n </span></blockquote>violent and I am so sick of hearing it! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are not &quot;this people&quot;. Who are they? Do they really matter? No <br/>\nthey don&#39;t, because they don&#39;t know what they are talking about. <br/>\nThey are merely repeating what&#39;s been told to them. So learn to <br/>\nblank out the next time they start to blah blah blah. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;helping him respect the boundaries of others. His 3 yr old friend <br/>\n </span></blockquote>has not seen Star Wars and doesn&#39;t want to (or know how to) fight <br/>\nwith stick light sabers!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour need to help your child find friends with similar interest. You <br/>\ncannot expect someone who&#39;s got no interest in StarWars to <br/>\nunderstand the fascination with lightsabers. You need another child <br/>\n(age is of no relevance) that loves Indiana Jones and Star Wars. <br/>\nGenerally you&#39;ll find children that likes Star Wars and Indiana <br/>\nJones, have very similar interest- they speak the same lingo!   <br/>\n<br/>\nFYI My child too tried to use his dad&#39;s measuring tape for a whip <br/>\nLOL!! Great mind think alike LOL!!! I think it&#39;s the retracting <br/>\naction that makes them think it&#39;s like a whip. But this doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nhe&#39;s trying to kill someone with a measuring tape! It&#39;s call <br/>\ncreative thinking LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;she feels that children are exposed to too much violence and they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>can&#39;t process or handle it in the same way adults can. She thinks <br/>\nviolent video games and movies have ratings for a reason and too many<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; parents ignore them. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rules are meant to be broken. Remember this saying? Can she honestly <br/>\nsay she herself never ever broken any rules/ laws at all? Why is she <br/>\nsuch a believer that rules for children must be good and therefore <br/>\nis beneficial to obey it? Is she saying that her peers that grew up <br/>\nwatched all those old cowboys movies is faulty?    <br/>\n<br/>\nIs she suggesting that in all the current war zones now like <br/>\nPakistan, there will never be a chance for those children there <br/>\ngrowing up and creating a peaceful future generation? Surely, if you <br/>\ngrowing up in a war zone, you&#39;re not just playing the game, you&#39;re <br/>\nconstantly exposed and living the violence right? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe children is our future. What hope will the world have now, for a <br/>\npeaceful future, with so many wars going on? <br/>\n<br/>\nViolent movies have been around for some many decades. We all <br/>\nwatched it, our parents watched it, their parents watched it. Before <br/>\nthe law enforce such ratings. <br/>\n<br/>\nSurely by now, we must be facing a world chock full of killers and <br/>\nviolence right? But yet, this is not the case, is it? We&#39;re all <br/>\nsensible human being. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will say what they wanna say, believe what they wanna <br/>\nbelieve. So, your girlfriend thinks your child is violent because <br/>\nyour child watches violent shows like Kung Fu Panda and Indiana <br/>\nJones. So then let her believe what she wants to believe. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know your child, and that what&#39;s matters. Focus on your life, <br/>\nand disregard how other&#39;s lead thier lives. Like the other mother <br/>\nwrote, just acknowledge thier views and be done with it. Don&#39;t <br/>\nbother explaining your views because they won&#39;t understand it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your child respecting boundaries in other people&#39;s home, <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s the wrong home to go visiting? I believe in this. My <br/>\nkid&#39;s very lively and love sticks. So i only go to a home that will <br/>\nwelcome and understand him. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, I do always tell my child and any visiting child, my <br/>\nhouse, my rules which means you can almost do whatever you want, <br/>\nfrom tv to dvd player to computer to ps2, have cupcakes and lovely <br/>\nstrawberry milk or any other drinks you want, as long as I have it <br/>\nin my fridge. Other mummy&#39;s house, then it&#39;s her rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, your kid at 4 years old, he&#39;s too young to understand <br/>\nthis &quot;consideration&quot; for other people. So maybe the adults is not <br/>\ntoo young to understand such consideration for the younger people? <br/>\n<br/>\nI also believe violence is nurtured (violent home, abusive <br/>\nenvironment), and not something you&#39;ll get out of watching or <br/>\nplaying with violence games. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a great big debate on the link bwteen violence and movies/ <br/>\nvideo games (many article can be found on the net).  <br/>\n<br/>\n2 school of thoughts - some believe movies and video games nurture <br/>\nviolence, some believe it&#39;s got no foundation - movies and video <br/>\ngames just happened to be current form of entertainment. Just like <br/>\nmany decades ago, Rock&Roll was the vehicle of violence instigator.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me, I just only mix with people who can accept my views, <br/>\nwhich I will not hide. I rather have no friends than to try to be <br/>\nfriends with people who try to impose thier restricting beliefs onto <br/>\nme. Maybe this is why i&#39;m alone and my kid only have 1 newly found <br/>\nfriend LOL! But I can tell you, when your child find the right <br/>\nfriend, it;s like kindred spirit meeting. They&#39;re on the same wave <br/>\nlenght, talk the same lingo, and can play harmoniously ALL THE <br/>\nTIME!!  <br/>\n <br/>\nHope this helps<br/>\n<br/>\nSharonBugs</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] more on movie violence","postDate":"1223407519","msgId":36404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4NDQxOC44MzI5MS5xbUB3ZWI1NDExMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzYjQwMWM5MjdlZiQyNzk3YjMxMCQ2NDBhYTlhOUBHb256bz4="},"prevInTopic":36391,"nextInTopic":36413,"prevInTime":36403,"nextInTime":36405,"topicId":36391,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~She is a middle school teacher and feels that children are exposed to too much violence and they can t process or handle it in the same way adults can.

I<br/>\nrealize all kids are different! As illustrated in the movie topic underway<br/>\nright now! But I&#39;d like more opinions on the idea that very young kids<br/>\ncannot handle certain violent (or sexual) content in movies (I was told<br/>\ntheir brains are not developed in such a way that they can process what they<br/>\nare seeing and make sense of things in reality and how they relate to the<br/>\nreal world). I think it totally depends on the kid. People keep telling me<br/>\nthat kids who are exposed to violence become violent and I am so sick of<br/>\nhearing it! My son hit me constantly before he ever watched TV! He has<br/>\nlearned so many good things from TV and movies (other languages, new<br/>\nanimals, science, how to treat your friends, etc) I am not surprised when he<br/>\nalso mimics the fighting scenes. I guess I also need advice on helping him<br/>\nrespect the boundaries of others. His 3 yr old friend has not seen Star Wars<br/>\nand doesn&#39;t want to (or know how to) fight with stick light sabers!<br/>\n <br/>\nHere is my scenario. My neighbor was walking by with her family yesterday<br/>\nand we made small talk. I mentioned that the 2nd run theater nearby had the<br/>\nlatest Indiana Jones movie and we were hoping to go see it soon. Her oldest<br/>\nson said, &quot;Oh that&#39;s supposed to be good! I want to see it too!&quot; and his mom<br/>\nsaid there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s PG-13. (I believe the boy is 9.) She said there<br/>\nwere things in there he shouldn&#39;t see and she felt it should even be rated<br/>\nPG-18 in her opinion. (Wouldn&#39;t that be R?!) So I did NOT mention to her<br/>\nthat we were thinking about taking our 4 yr old! He has seen all 6 Star Wars<br/>\nmovies and LOVES them!!! I know other kids his age could not handle it, but<br/>\nhonestly my son sits in his seat and pays attention to the stories. We talk<br/>\nabout them and he knows a lot of the characters and how they relate to one<br/>\nanother. He saw the first Indiana Jones movie (although he did go to bed<br/>\nbefore the end scene where the box opens!) and likes to play like he is Indy<br/>\non adventures. Mostly I feel it&#39;s pretty healthy! He also used to play like<br/>\nhe is Diego, saving animals from danger. It seems good for the imagination.<br/>\n <br/>\nI told this to my good friend and she said she agreed with my neighbor! She<br/>\nis a middle school teacher and feels that children are exposed to too much<br/>\nviolence and they can&#39;t process or handle it in the same way adults can. She<br/>\nthinks violent video games and movies have ratings for a reason and too many<br/>\nparents ignore them. She told me that my son has violent tendencies from<br/>\nthings we have exposed him to. He copies things he sees in movies. My friend<br/>\ntold me that my son was using a tape measure as a whip the other day when we<br/>\nwere all at a birthday party for a 2 yr old. (He was pretending to be Indy,<br/>\nchasing the birthday girl with a whip. Now, do I also need to mention my<br/>\nfriend&#39;s son was part of the chase as well?) I did not see this and she said<br/>\nshe had to take it away from him. We talked later about how Indiana does not<br/>\nuse his whip on PEOPLE, only to get him out of sticky situations. (I would<br/>\nhave talked with him on the spot if I had known about the tape measure<br/>\nwhip.) I&#39;m sure it was handled without sensitivity. (Yoink! - I don&#39;t like<br/>\nthe way you are playing so I&#39;m taking that now, as in you are being punished<br/>\nfor the way you are playing.) Maybe we need to watch part of the movie<br/>\nagain? I guess I also don&#39;t know how to talk to my friend who has constant<br/>\ninteractions with my son because of our friendship.<br/>\n <br/>\nHe went through a phase of being a Kung Fu Panda where he would air punch or<br/>\nkick at his friends and her son (14 mos younger) cried a lot when they<br/>\nplayed together. I think my son needs some older friends, but also that he<br/>\nshould know when someone doesn&#39;t want to play like he does and find<br/>\nsomething they can enjoy together. That is hard when I&#39;m sort of forcing him<br/>\nto play with this 3 yr old because his mom and I are friends! DH and I talk<br/>\na lot about respecting other people, though we&#39;re not sure we&#39;re getting<br/>\nthrough to him because he still does punch moves and light saber attacks.<br/>\nPerhaps we are approaching it wrong? How to talk to a 4 yr old?!<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how this is related, or if I could even bring it up with my<br/>\nfriend, but the whole time we were talking on the phone about the movie<br/>\nviolence topic, her 3 yr old was hitting her and yelling MAMA! MAMA!<br/>\nMAAAAAMAAAAA!!!! to get her attention. Several times I heard her yell at him<br/>\nto be quiet or stop hitting her and to get off of her and how he needed to<br/>\ngo find something to do while she was on the phone. I finally said you&#39;ve<br/>\ngot your hands full, we can talk later. It just struck me as odd that her<br/>\nchild was doing that on his own, as she can tell you he has never seen a<br/>\nviolent movie! How do I address that? I know there is an arguement there<br/>\nsomewhere, I just can&#39;t put it together!<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you for your thoughts on this. If this has been brought up a thousand<br/>\ntimes, just tell me to search the archives!
