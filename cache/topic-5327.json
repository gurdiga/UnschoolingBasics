He largely circled the Yugioh tables waiting and watching until he felt confident enough to join in the duels. He also hung out in the games room. Again, watching and waiting until he wanted to play too. There were other things going on. He had a blast playing with some boys down by the lake on the night of the bonfire. It was his kind of game, and imagined quest of sorts. He talked about that for a long time. Live and Learn was a great place for Simon to move slowly into interactions with others.

Re: Please help me off this fence!<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:LifeisGoodconference@yahoogroups.com\">LifeisGoodconference@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Clarissa Fetrow&quot;<br/>\n&lt;clarissafetrow@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if anyone has any reassuring thoughts on why we should take<br/>\n&gt; the plunge, despite concerns, and come to the conference?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Clarrisa, we went to our first unschooling conference when my kids were <br/>\n6 and 2.<br/>\nI knew no one in person, but recognized a few names from some of the <br/>\nlists I had been<br/>\nreading. My husband knew nothing except what I had told him. We aren&#39;t <br/>\nthe most social<br/>\npeople, my daughter (then 6) takes a looooong time to warm up to people <br/>\nand there wasn&#39;t<br/>\nthat kind of time at the conference so she didn&#39;t really make any <br/>\nfriends or play at<br/>\nall with anyone. But she watched, oh how she watched, and took it all <br/>\nin! Even now 2<br/>\nyears later she will sometimes comment on something from that first <br/>\nconference, such as<br/>\nsomething she now has or is doing that she saw another child playing <br/>\nwith or doing at the<br/>\nconference. It opened up so many people and ideas to her. The next time <br/>\nwe went<br/>\nand she saw folks she had seen before, she was much more ready to talk <br/>\nto them and be<br/>\ndrawn in. And now, after 3 conferences, she wouldn&#39;t let us stay home <br/>\nif there was any way<br/>\nat all she could change our minds (not that she&#39;d have to work too <br/>\nhard!) - she loves it,<br/>\nis so looking forward to seeing some of her special friends again, to <br/>\nbeing opened to new<br/>\nideas and new things she will love exploring on her own afterwards, <br/>\nseeing everyone&#39;s<br/>\ntalents at the talent show, walking around in a little bubble of <br/>\nfreedom roaming the hotel because we<br/>\nare all there and it is a comfortable place for her to try out being <br/>\nmore social and independent.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of folks comment that their kids are too young to go to a <br/>\nconference, they<br/>\nthink they should wait till they&#39;re older. But I would say it was <br/>\ninfinitely more important<br/>\nfor us as a family to go when the kids were younger - to give us a <br/>\nblueprint for how we<br/>\ncould be with them, to unite my husband and I, to see how the <br/>\nunschoolers look all grown up,<br/>\nto find friends who understand us and will support us through some of <br/>\nour doubtful days.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur first conference was where it &quot;clicked&quot; for Craig (dh), where he <br/>\nreally<br/>\nunderstood what it was all about and started to actively rather than <br/>\npassively live this life.<br/>\nHe met so many dads who connected with our cosleeping, extended <br/>\nnursing, kids are people too,<br/>\nreading will come as it comes, type philosophy (so different from his <br/>\nusual interactions<br/>\nat the office etc), he really felt supported and no longer on the <br/>\noutside of something.<br/>\nHe saw the older kids and how confident and neat they all were, how <br/>\ntheir uniqueness had<br/>\nbeen celebrated, how they seemed so comfortable in their own skins <br/>\n(more so even than<br/>\nwe did!) and he wanted that for his own kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe experience brought us to a new place, it gave us confidence, it <br/>\ngave us a<br/>\nsupport network of folks, it put faces to the names we had been reading <br/>\non lists so now<br/>\nthe lists seemed more like chats amongst friends and no longer posts <br/>\nfrom (possibly crazy)<br/>\nstrangers, it opened up worlds to our kids we could never have opened <br/>\nourselves<br/>\n(our reserved dd performed on stage at the last conference!?), it <br/>\nopened our eyes to<br/>\nways we had been holding back - that first conference literally changed <br/>\nour lives. The<br/>\nfollowing ones have cemented the change, but the first one was <br/>\ncataclysmic for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how it will be for your family, but we struggled with the <br/>\nidea of<br/>\ngoing to our first, the money, was it worth it, shouldn&#39;t we wait. We <br/>\ndidn&#39;t decide until 2<br/>\nweeks before and then it was all a rush and a holler. I am *so* glad we <br/>\ndidn&#39;t let our<br/>\npractical natures win out. It is scary to think where we would be now <br/>\nas parents if we hadn&#39;t made<br/>\nthat leap and stretched ourselves to go into the wide open arms of a <br/>\nhotel full of<br/>\nstrangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have come so far as to post to this list wondering if you should <br/>\ncome, it<br/>\nsounds like the idea, the philosophy, really appeals to you so I&#39;d say <br/>\ndo whatever it takes<br/>\nto make it just this once. Despite the cost, it can&#39;t really hurt you <br/>\ntoo much, and it<br/>\ncould very well change your lives completely. Coming once doesn&#39;t <br/>\ncommit you to ever coming<br/>\nagain. &lt;Asheville&gt; is worth a visit anyway for all its cool things to <br/>\ndo so you won&#39;t be<br/>\nwasting your time even if you hate the conference (which you won&#39;t, but <br/>\njust to reassure).<br/>\nAnd you will meet people from all over the country (continent!) which <br/>\nis like a social<br/>\nstudies field trip in itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;Plus, it&#39;s the LAST one.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Gillian<br/>\nand Craig of Effie (8) and Fergus (4)<br/>\nVictoria BC Canada<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"Re: Live and Learn Conference","postDate":"1112361477","msgId":5348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQyamhtNSs2NjI4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDNzA0NzUwQjNBMzEzRC0xMzgtMUFDQkNAbWJsay1kNTEuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5346,"nextInTopic":31588,"prevInTime":5347,"nextInTime":5349,"topicId":5327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I know you will Kelly! - I was responding to the earlier post that said registration was -already- available and, alas, I wasn t seeing it.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-519294563\">I know you will Kelly! - I was responding to the earlier post that <br/>\nsaid registration was -already- available and, alas, I wasn&#39;t seeing <br/>\nit.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Live and Learn Conference","postDate":"1112320541","msgId":5346,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzA0NzUwQjNBMzEzRC0xMzgtMUFDQkNAbWJsay1kNTEuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyY2s5citlcXZiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":5331,"nextInTopic":5348,"prevInTime":5345,"nextInTime":5347,"topicId":5327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
