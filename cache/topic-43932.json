So, yes, it is VERY doable - particularly if you bring an<br/>\nunschooling outlook to the class preparation. Seriously, if I was tied<br/>\nto a boxed curriculum with X number of worksheets, having extra kids<br/>\nshow up would be a problem and having less kids show up would leave lots<br/>\nof &#39;waste&#39; paper.

There have even<br/>\nbeen days when I&#39;ve read the text for the lesson, discussed it a little<br/>\nbit to help with new words if necessary or summarize a concept or<br/>\nwhatever and then I just pull out craft supplies or small jigsaw puzzles<br/>\nand we have a play day.

You are so right.  That&#39;s what attracts me to the Quakers in the first place.  Their focus is on the Truth that is in your own heart and sharing that with others.  Not on dogma, creeds, externals, etc.  I do enjoy going and go when I can.  I just get caught up in feeling guilty for leaving my family at home, even when they are perfectly happy to hang out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust to clarify - My husband doesn&#39;t go at all.  I pretty much gave up on that completely last year. My oldest (9) doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere right now.  And, my youngest (7) likes a United Church of Christ church we have gone to on occasion.  It is just a little further (40 mins.) than I would like to have to go on a Sunday.  (We moved a year ago and live in nowhere land.)  The Quaker meeting is only 20 mins. away.  I probably will split my time between the 2 since the younger one does like to go some.  (The Quaker meeting currently has no other children and therefore no First Day (Sunday) school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I have a hard time letting go of feeling like I need to choose a church and be committed, is that I&#39;ve been on the other side of the fence.

It&#39;s very hard to plan things when folks are not consistent.  So, I guess I feel like I need to choose one place and stick with it, or maybe not go at all for now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know I sound conflicted!

YOU alone. You can, really, with a happy heart! You can choose  <br/>\n&gt; to come home and share the JOY that church fills you with! You can come  <br/>\n&gt; home energized, LIVING the word, SHOWING your family how much you  <br/>\n&gt; appreciate their (at home even) support for you to do what is important to  <br/>\n&gt; YOU.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; It is hard for me to go occasionally and not get really involved, since  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; this is my natural inclination. But, the more I get involved the more it  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; takes me away from my family, and that feels wrong as well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; so what if it&#39;s hard. Don&#39;t do what doesn&#39;t work for your FAMILY. The  <br/>\n&gt; church (as a whole) will still be there when your kids don&#39;t need you so  <br/>\n&gt; much. Those volunteer opportunities will STILL be there when YOUR kids  <br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need you so much. You CAN go there for what you NEED and that is all.  <br/>\n&gt; If there are other, uncomfortable obligations: Get a new church.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have always been of the opinion that religion/spirituality should  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not be confined to the hours that are spent in a church or involved in  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; church activities. It is so much more all encompassing than that. If  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; religion/spirituality are part of your everyday life, kids will naturally  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pick up on it and it will be something that is done as a family. Actually  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; going to church is just one small part of the larger equation. If you are  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; not comfortable having literature and information from other religions in  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; your house, then find materials that relate directly to your religion to  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; strew around the house.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree. There is a lot more to spirituality than going to church,  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and, for the time being, while my kids are young, I may have to let go of  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; regular church altogether. I have a great book, The Seven Laws or  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual Success for Parents, by Depak Chopra. The ideas expressed are  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; universal to all religions and there are suggestions for integrating  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; these &quot;laws&quot; into everyday life with children. So, I can just start  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; focusing on that, and we could do something fun and meaningful on Sundays  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; together with me going occasionally when the rest of the family just  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; wants to hang out at home.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You mention on another post about choosing between family and faith.<br/>\n&gt; OUCHIE! Do. Not. Put. This. On. Your. Kids!<br/>\n&gt; Your faith is YOURS, you carry it with your everywhere (or not...) It&#39;s not  <br/>\n&gt; in a building or residing with a group of people-who-are-not-you. Your  <br/>\n&gt; faith is not separate from you, nor your family. Nor is anyone else on this  <br/>\n&gt; planet responsible for your faith.<br/>\n&gt; You are facing the choice of leaving your family (or finding a way to make  <br/>\n&gt; them go with you) to worship in an *out there* place -or- one of a  <br/>\n&gt; gazillion other options for creating sacred space and worshiping *in here*  <br/>\n&gt; where YOU are.

My husband was even a Benedictine monk for a while. He grew up in a very religious family that insisted on going to church no matter what. My husband&#39;s parents were crushed when he left the monastery because having a monk/cleric in the family is so highly regarded to them. It is so ingrained in my husband that he still prays the divine office several times a day. Our girls see him praying and reading and can ask about it at any time. We talk a lot about church and religion when the kids are around. We share our experiences with our kids and with each other. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As a result, when my husband wants to go to church, he invites the kids to go along. If they want to go, they go. If they don&#39;t want to go, they stay home with me. There was a period of time where we tried to go as a family but that was too stressful for me and for the kids that couldn&#39;t sit still. Even with a cry room, it was too stressful because I felt like people were watching me and the kids and were scrutinizing our every move. I found myself hating church and losing my own sense of spirituality. When the little ones (3 & 16 months) get bigger, we may try to go as a family again but it won&#39;t be a big deal if somebody doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 5 year old will sometimes ask to go to church and my husband will take her. My 8 year old has no interest in going to church but she likes to pray and talk about God. My girls also love the Veggie Tales movies. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have applied strewing to religion just like we do everything else. We have all kinds of religious icons (crosses, Indian art, Buddha&#39;s, etc.) through out our house. We also have a variety of books about religion and spirituality. Whenever we are at a book store or thrift store, we pick up books about religion and spirituality. We found one the other day about atheist spirituality. The point is that you can force a kid to go to church but that won&#39;t make them spiritual or even religious. Some kids grow up being forced to go to church their whole lives and still reject religion when they get older. Some kids never go to church but grow up to be very religious people. I try to expose my kids to a little bit of everything so that they can make up their own minds. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Connie<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132876517,"authorName":"AECANGORA@aol.com","from":"AECANGORA@...","profile":"amy_aec","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:  Going to church!","postDate":"1273497929","msgId":43932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQ0JFNUI2NEM2MDE2OC0xNDYwLTY1MjRAd2VibWFpbC1tMDc3LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43933,"prevInTime":43931,"nextInTime":43933,"topicId":43932,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Connie, Thanks for answering my question.

My husband was even a Benedictine monk for a while. He grew up in a very religious family that insisted on going to church no matter what. My husband&#39;s parents were crushed when he left the monastery because having a monk/cleric in the family is so highly regarded to them. It is so ingrained in my husband that he still prays the divine office several times a day. Our girls see him praying and reading and can ask about it at any time. We talk a lot about church and religion when the kids are around. We share our experiences with our kids and with each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, when my husband wants to go to church, he invites the kids to go along. If they want to go, they go. If they don&#39;t want to go, they stay home with me. There was a period of time where we tried to go as a family but that was too stressful for me and for the kids that couldn&#39;t sit still. Even with a cry room, it was too stressful because I felt like people were watching me and the kids and were scrutinizing our every move. I found myself hating church and losing my own sense of spirituality. When the little ones (3 & 16 months) get bigger, we may try to go as a family again but it won&#39;t be a big deal if somebody doesn&#39;t want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old will sometimes ask to go to church and my husband will take her. My 8 year old has no interest in going to church but she likes to pray and talk about God. My girls also love the Veggie Tales movies. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have applied strewing to religion just like we do everything else. We have all kinds of religious icons (crosses, Indian art, Buddha&#39;s, etc.) through out our house. We also have a variety of books about religion and spirituality. Whenever we are at a book store or thrift store, we pick up books about religion and spirituality. We found one the other day about atheist spirituality. The point is that you can force a kid to go to church but that won&#39;t make them spiritual or even religious. Some kids grow up being forced to go to church their whole lives and still reject religion when they get older. Some kids never go to church but grow up to be very religious people. I try to expose my kids to a little bit of everything so that they can make up their own minds. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44128,"nextTopicId":44145}}
