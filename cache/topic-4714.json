I have gone to battle with the administration before when they<br/>\ntried to make a rule that teachers&#39; kids couldn&#39;t come to their<br/>\nclassrooms until after 4:00.  The whole reason I was at this school was<br/>\nto be *with* my kids whenever they were not in school.  I got special<br/>\npermission to not follow the rule, although the rule was not changed.  I<br/>\nhad to be pretty darn insistent that I was not willing to work there<br/>\nunder those conditions.<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see tomorrow just how supportive the administration will be.<br/>\nSupposedly we have a &quot;no bullying&quot; policy; I have seen enough to know<br/>\nthat we have poor administration follow through with discipline though,<br/>\nso I don&#39;t have much hope that the problem will be fixed.
