Usually, my husband gets up with her, but this time I volunteered so that he could sleep uninterrupted. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a very still, silent, warm night after days of thunderstorms. While I was waiting for the dog to finish her business, I heard a screech owl calling from a nearby tree (yes, I thought of you, Meredith!). My girls were still up, so they came out to join me to listen to the owl. Then, by some uncanny coincidence, my son and husband woke up and walked outside, too. We all stood under the tree and listened to our owl calling back and forth with another screech owl doing a hunting call around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my husband&#39;s job, 2 tween girls, a home business, and very different personalities, we rarely get that kind of peaceful, silent, *togetherness* as a family. It was so rejuvenating!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad that I *spoiled* my husband today!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura McD.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44000,"nextTopicId":43964}}
