I was posting about an idea that was brought to the forum.<br/>\nAdoption is a topic that has come up frequently and while I can&#39;t remember a time that I&#39;ve chimed in with my ideas on the subject (usually it takes the form of I&#39;m thinking of adopting what do you all think?) I&#39;ve noticed quite frequently that in our society, adoption is frequently pointed out. That is the idea that I was commenting on.<br/>\nI tried very hard to write about the idea rather than the OP&#39;s family.<br/>\n****It would be helpful to me if you could qualify your position on this <br/>\nas I can&#39;t tell whether you are coming from a position of hurt, <br/>\nmisinformation (about me and my journey - obviously you have your own <br/>\nexperience of adoption) or something completely different.*****<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by qualify. I guess that I feel that families are families, however they come to be. Again, I&#39;m not talking specifically about you and your journey, just about the idea of how our society views adoptees.<br/>\n*********I can assure you that, when our daughter is officially ours she will <br/>\nbe every bit as equal as our other children - I&#39;m actually deeply <br/>\noffended at any hint of a suggestion otherwise -********<br/>\nThere was no suggestion otherwise, not at all in my mind.<br/>\n********however, the fact <br/>\nthat she is adopted will also be freely discussed with her as it is a <br/>\nhuge part of who she is.******<br/>\nOf course! It is important, I&#39;m not denying that.<br/>\n*******I would like to think that one day she will <br/>\nbe proud to tell people she is adopted safe in the knowledge that she <br/>\nis loved and lives and learns in a secure, loving environment and <br/>\nhaving learned from that that adoption is not a dirty word (ie that <br/>\nbeing described as an adoptee is neither hurtful nor unloving).******<br/>\nI think that while being described that way (not by you in particular but by our society) is not intentionally hurtful or unloving, there is a potential to be faced with difficult moments. People say stupid stuff out of ignorance.<br/>\nAgain, I want to be clear that I was not talking about You and Your family, but about the idea that changing our words is very important in order to change our thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nA Kindersher saychel iz oychet a saychel.<br/>\n&quot;A Child&#39;s wisdom is also wisdom.&quot; ~Yiddish Proverb<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10290,"nextTopicId":18161}}
