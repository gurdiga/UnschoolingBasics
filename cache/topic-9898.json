It <br/>\nalso includes things like picking up objects so our plastic chewing <br/>\ndog doesn&#39;t get hurt or sick (I revised &quot;toys&quot; to include other <br/>\nstuff since it&#39;s not just toys that get chewed) and so no one steps <br/>\non something and gets hurt or damages the item (which would impact <br/>\nthe owner). It&#39;s been harder for DH to adjust to this because he <br/>\ngrew up in a very rules environment (his dad is ex-Air Force) and <br/>\nhe&#39;ll often fall back to stating &#39;rules&#39; when he gets feeling <br/>\nstressed. DS will say &quot;too many rules!&quot; and we can step back and see <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on. <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223344266,"authorName":"Christy Putnam","from":"&quot;Christy Putnam&quot; &lt;personal_balance@...&gt;","profile":"personal_balance","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Various Questions (and a great moment to share)","postDate":"1139435075","msgId":9898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjAwMWM2MmNmOCRkYWUxMmVhMCQ2NDAxYThjMEB0aWJlcml1bT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":9899,"prevInTime":9897,"nextInTime":9899,"topicId":9898,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well first I wanna start by saying that I have learned so much from you all.

This is hard since habits have been that we ask him to do<br/>\nsomething or he knows it is his responsibility then he doesn&#39;t do it so we<br/>\neither get mad or guilt him into doing it.  I hate that I had been doing<br/>\nthat but now I know better, I am doing better :)<br/>\n <br/>\nI want to share a great moment that I will never forget: The other day after<br/>\nsome light grocery shopping, I asked that he help bring the &#39;cold&#39; groceries<br/>\nin because I needed to use the bathroom really bad (bad planning on my part)<br/>\nand I didn&#39;t want them sitting in the van.  He readily agreed to help and<br/>\nactually took more than 1 bag (just enough to say helped) so we got it all<br/>\nin 1 trip!  Okay so that in itself is great to me but there is more.  In the<br/>\nbrief time I was in the bathroom, he had put ALL the groceries away AND<br/>\nswitched the laundry (took the clothes out of the dryer and replaced them<br/>\nwith what 1 had put in the washer before leaving).  I am glad I &#39;caught him<br/>\nin the act&#39; so I could say something right away.  In my joking tone of voice<br/>\nI asked &quot;Why did you put the groceries away and switch the laundry...what do<br/>\nyou want from me?&quot;  He laughed and said &quot;A million bucks&quot; and then said &quot;no,<br/>\nI did it because you have been so nice to me lately that I wanted to do<br/>\nsomething nice for you&quot;  So to that I gave him a big hug and told him thank<br/>\nyou and how good it felt for him to do something to help out.  This was a<br/>\nbig moment for me because it showed me what I knew in my heart...that this<br/>\nstuff really works!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have some questions mainly for my 1 year old but also for my 11 year old:<br/>\n1) How do you all feel about weaning for the bottle (wasn&#39;t able to bf, long<br/>\nstory)?  I am pretty sure your answer is there is no timeline, they will<br/>\nwean when they are ready.  I just am not sure he is getting everything he<br/>\nneeds from drinking from a cup and eating table food.  It just seems he is<br/>\nnot sleeping well and I am wondering if he is just not getting enough to<br/>\neat/drink.  I was weaning because the dr. said that if I don&#39;t wean him b4<br/>\n14 mo it will be harder to do but now I am thinking...I have never seen a 3<br/>\nor 4 year old drinking from a bottle so whets the big deal, he will wean<br/>\nhimself when ready.  I mean its not like he carries the thing around and its<br/>\nnot a pacifier...Also, if I *had* been able to bf, I wouldn&#39;t even be<br/>\nthinking about weaning at all.  Anyway, just wanting ya&#39;lls thoughts on<br/>\nweaning.<br/>\n <br/>\n2) What guidelines/rules do you have in place for your households?  I am<br/>\nthinking you refer to them as them guidelines more than rules because<br/>\nguidelines would be more gentle and not really something you punish.  I am<br/>\nalso thinking these would be safety related more than anything.<br/>\n <br/>\nI had other questions but I have forgotten them.  I am sure I will remember<br/>\nand post later.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn Gratitude,<br/>\n<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nUnschooling Mom to Aden (1) and Seth (11)<br/>\nLoving wife of Chet (ann. 7/4/04)<br/>\n<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a>&gt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance\">http://blog.myspace.com/personal_balance</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go confidently in the direction of your<br/>\ndreams.
