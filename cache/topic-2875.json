All the <br/>\nemotions you and your son are experieincing are completely normal.  There is a <br/>\ntime period right after leaving the school environment known as <br/>\n&#39;deschooling&#39;.  It&#39;s just a period of readjustment. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family lives very rural and have no neighbors.  What has worked for us is <br/>\ngetting the girls involved in something they have an interest in.  What does <br/>\nyour son enjoy doing?  Maybe there is someplace he can volunteer.  My dd/12.5 <br/>\nloves horses and animals in general.  She is volunteering with a local horse <br/>\nrescue group.  My other dd/4.5 will be joining gymnastics this Fall.  Through <br/>\nthese and many other activities, they have come to meet friends.  They have a <br/>\nsmall group that they hang out with on a fairly consistent basis. But they also <br/>\nhave many interests that they pursue on their own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe may feel &#39;bored&#39; and need some support in helping him figure out what he <br/>\nwants to pursue. Another &#39;out of the house&#39; activity we do often, is go to the <br/>\nState Park --- the naturalist there is always doing some really cool workshop. <br/>\n My girls love anything having to do with critters or bugs! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;ll work out, I promise -- it&#39;s all good! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll my best,<br/>\nHelen (DE, USA)<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.--If you live near a beach, September is the best month for playing! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165889631,"authorName":"Syndi","from":"&quot;Syndi&quot; &lt;justlikemama@...&gt;","profile":"justlikemama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Feeling left behind","postDate":"1092978339","msgId":2875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNnNDByMys5YXFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2879,"prevInTime":2874,"nextInTime":2876,"topicId":2875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi guys, Wow, I sure didn t realize that we had a Dr on board here, how cool!

Still a book I intend to get and read!<br/>\n  Anyway, alittle update here. This is the first year we have not <br/>\nstarted ps for my ds11.  And it was so exciting not to have to worry <br/>\nabout buying all that stuff for school, let alone having to let my <br/>\nkids go when time.  This is what we were both feeling.  Then it hit.  <br/>\n1st me, then him.  A feeling of being left behind hearing about <br/>\nschool starting and everyone out shopping and people that don&#39;t know <br/>\nus asking, are you excited?!  And with him, just that general <br/>\ndepression that he had to leave all his friends when he left school. <br/>\nWe live in a rual area, with only one kid on our block.  And I did <br/>\ntry to get him to set up a weekend with a friend or two, but it was <br/>\nsuch a busy, and SHORT summer!  <br/>\n  Anyway, does anyone have any words of wisdom on this?  I&#39;ve told <br/>\nKaleb that he is more then welcome to invite anyone over, even though <br/>\nthey are in school, they can still come on the weekends.  He seemed <br/>\nhappy with that, then we ran into one of his old buddies while we <br/>\nwere out and it started it up again.  This time it lasted just a day <br/>\nor two, but i&#39;m not sure how to help him.  Or do I need to unless he <br/>\nasks?  <br/>\nThanks all<br/>\nSyndi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2901,"nextTopicId":2900}}
