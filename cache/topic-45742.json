Next, although<br/>\nyou may already know about it and have things in hand, be sure to be in<br/>\ncontact with the &quot;discharge coordinator&quot; at the hospital to arrange for<br/>\nhome care and respite care. All of you need some way of having a break,<br/>\nnot just rotating between you and your mom to care for a recovering<br/>\nstroke patient. You&#39;ll all need some assistance in learning to do<br/>\nwhatever needs doing and a &#39;lifeline&#39; for providing assistance/advice<br/>\nfor new situations that may arise. If your stepfather was prickly to<br/>\nbegin with, he&#39;s liable to be even touchier now because he won&#39;t be able<br/>\nto do all that he might once have done (physically AND mentally).<br/>\nEveryone in the situation needs a way to keep themselves physically and<br/>\nemotionally safe - it can be very easy to get sucked into a maelstrom of<br/>\nturbulence.
