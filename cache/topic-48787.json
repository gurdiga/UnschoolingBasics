Even if they&#39;re in a modern setting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee this is yet another reason why I have this problem. To her, books are real. She reads the warrior cat books and she wants to BE those cats. She BELIEVES our own cats have human feelings. To a point beyond, they are hungry or sad. She actually said something yesterday about thinking it was weird that some people on Deviant Art (friends of hers I guess) are not even attracted to humans, but to animals instead. She then said she went through a phase where she felt that way, but says she doesn&#39;t anymore. HOWEVER she does believe her cat is attracted to her. I got the very distinct impression she was feeling me out to see if I thought it was weird or normal. My only reaction was to say that it was illegal to have &quot;that&quot; sort of relationship with an animal. At this point in time it doesn&#39;t seem irrational to me, I have a real fear based on things she is actually saying to me. Even for me, being uber open minded about sex, I still don&#39;t understand being attracted to animals. She has access to every book out there, but she routinely chooses books about animals (like the warrior cats, where they have human type personalities). Even the romance books she chooses always include a wolf, or other sort of shape shifting animal. I know you had said something previously about kids going from animals, to animals with human characteristics, and then on to humans, I believe in response to exploring sexual themes. This is a little different as it actually seems to be an attraction to animals, or the perception that an animal is attracted to her. She will not get dressed in front of her cat because he&#39;s male. I&#39;m not kidding.. Maybe this is something she will outgrow, I have no idea. It worries me to the point that I think maybe I should mention it to a therapist. She has said repeatedly that she&#39;s just not into boys yet, (her friend is boy crazy and she was saying that they don&#39;t have that much in common because she&#39;s not really into boys yet) but her reading material would suggest otherwise. I do know that she has told me she thinks she is bisexual, and that&#39;s fine with me and I told her so. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You could share some of yours that you feel comfortable sharing. And then ask about those. If she feels comfortable sharing what she&#39;s finding with you then she will.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you mean some of the romance/erotica books I read? Or just some of the books I read outside of that genre? I don&#39;t think I would feel comfortable with sharing the type of romance books I read, but I do share other genres already. I read the Hunger Games trilogy back before it was popular (otherwise I&#39;m sure she would have heard about it on her own) and I told her how awesome it was and suggested she read it. She loved it too, couldn&#39;t wait for the movie to come out, and even wanted a bow and arrow for Christmas,(she got one) I also suggested Incarceron, which she also loved. However she never chooses those sorts of books herself. She does share some of her books with me, like the warrior cats series, and a few others. They&#39;re hard for me to read because they are very uninteresting to me, but I do my best so I can try to share in her enthusiasm. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Our sense of norm comes from home then from real people around us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nExactly what I&#39;m afraid of ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Aug 9, 2012, at 4:49 AM, sarahrandom78 wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Part of my underlying fear is that she will read some of these books,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; get the idea that this stuff is the norm, and it will make her fear yet one more thing in life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our sense of norm comes from home then from real people around us.

I&#39;m not trying to say she can&#39;t read this, or I forbid it, but previously when she&#39;s bought a book, I&#39;ll ask her how it was, or what it was about, because I&#39;m genuinely curious and that is one of the very few things (reading) that we have in common, but when I see authors who&#39;s work I&#39;m familiar with, like this new stuff she&#39;s bought, that&#39;s where I&#39;m stumped. I just don&#39;t know how to approach it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Most novels written for women contain a certain amount of sex&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, especially the novels I read. The more the better in my opinion. I also read lots of stuff that is pretty out there, I believe it&#39;s in the open-minded section on my nook. I&#39;m also 33. I have no problem with her exploring her sexuality in this venue (and really, would it even matter if I did? Probably not.) in fact I think it&#39;s perfectly normal and healthy. I guess part of me is just a little worried. As I&#39;ve said numerous times on this list, my daughter has an anxiety disorder. Part of my underlying fear is that she will read some of these books, get the idea that this stuff is the norm, and it will make her fear yet one more thing in life. Or make her worry that that is how sex actually is, but will be afraid to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sarah Taylor &lt;bdb1978@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;My<br/>\n&gt; &gt; question is: How do I handle these issues?

The more options she has, the less she&#39;ll need to hang around places with people who make her uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some DeviantArt people are using Tumblr. I think there are channels to subscribe to so it&#39;s easier for people with common interests to find each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also groups around the internet, especially for Warrior Cats. You might try reading in some of the Warrior Cats groups on Deviant Art or just searching on line to see what&#39;s recommended. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; For instance, she made friends with a boy who talked<br/>\n&gt; about legal trouble he had been in previously, and when she didn&#39;t get on<br/>\n&gt; the computer for approximately a week, he had sent her messages alluding to<br/>\n&gt; contemplating suicide because she had &quot;abandoned&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It can help to stay connected to her feelings but detach from the problem. Help her with ideas, and strategies for dealing with such encounters. They&#39;ll be skills she can use throughout life -- but let her decide how to handle it. (In addition to handling it emotionally and how to respond, dA has ways to block people. She can also hide any comments she doesn&#39;t want to see.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBe her resource rather than her problem solver.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My daughter has<br/>\n&gt; generalized anxiety, and being on this site causes her anxiety to spike<br/>\n&gt; (from people like this boy, to people critiquing her artwork, etc.) My<br/>\n&gt; question is: How do I handle these issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How does she want you to?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 13 she&#39;s growing more into needing you for advice rather than to physically do things for her. These are complex social issues which need a lot of practice. The great thing about the internet is she can practice without being in any danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The relationship approach by Mira Kirshenbaum:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/23rhfms\">http://tinyurl.com/23rhfms</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be essential reading for every parent before their kids become teens :-D<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; How can I help ensure she&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; communicating with unsafe people without invading her privacy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What could &quot;unsafe&quot; people offer her that you can&#39;t? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents tend to picture that strangers must be inherently drawing if they&#39;re able to lure kids into meeting with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what predators have is the ability to suss out kids needs that the parents are refusing to meet. A stranger with candy isn&#39;t dangerous if a kid&#39;s life is full of easily available candy. If a stranger is offering understanding or what you refuse to support your kids in exploring, you&#39;re making your kids vulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most dangerous phrase a child can hear from a stranger is &quot;I understand.&quot; (An &quot;I understand,&quot; that&#39;s NOT followed by a &quot;but&quot;!) A parent can suck the power out of a stranger&#39;s use of that phrase by using it themselves and by having the child trust that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We&#39;ve tried<br/>\n&gt; meet up groups but it seems like most people that attend have younger<br/>\n&gt; children, and she really wants friends closer to her own age.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you tried starting up a group yourself? You could advertise a Warrior Cats group on your local email list. A local family started a Friday night movie night. She got it started but then the kids picked the movie for the next time themselves. They had discussions about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also, she has<br/>\n&gt; a nook e-reader and because you have to have a credit card to buy books,<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s registered with my e-mail address and card number so I can&#39;t help but<br/>\n&gt; see what books she&#39;s purchasing. Some of these titles are by authors of<br/>\n&gt; hard core erotica. Should I say anything to her about her choice of reading<br/>\n&gt; material?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having been on DeviantArt for a couple of years, I&#39;m still surprised at how young some kids are when they start exploring sexual themes in their writing and art (even though no one&#39;s supposed to be under 18 on there ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter observing it for those years, it all feels very natural. It usually starts with animal characters and progresses to humans with animal features and onto humans. It even explores boys love themes. Seen causally from the outside it&#39;s shocking. Seeing it in the context of what else the kids are doing, it seems totally and completely natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting to know your kids, being their support system, can help you see a bigger picture and be less worried about these odd things that poke up ;-) They look much less odd in the full context.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; On the one hand I feel like I shouldn&#39;t because I don&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; make her feel embarrassed about her emerging sexuality, but on the other<br/>\n&gt; hand, some of these books have themes that are...envelope pushing?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rather than being concerned about what she&#39;s reading see it as an interest. You can offer resources to expand on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if she were ordering books about horses? What would you do? How would you support her? Well, you might want to take her to a horse show but might not want to take her to a sex show! ;-) But the point is to not wash over her interest with worry and judgement. She&#39;ll see you as someone her interests aren&#39;t safe with and hide the parts she thinks you&#39;ll make judgements about! Her interests are part of who she is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are books on sexuality that she might be interested in. I&#39;m sure members here can recommend some their kids liked, but it&#39;s also easy enough to search Amazon and read through the reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Scarleteen site is really good:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.scarleteen.com\">http://www.scarleteen.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA really good program that&#39;s run by the Unitarian Universalists and The United Church of Christ is Our Whole Lives, a sexuality program. (There are several editions of the program divided up by age groups.) The UU program is presented without the God component, the UCC program adds the Christian point of view. (They developed it together so that part is removable or addable so it doesn&#39;t feel like there are holes or something&#39;s been tacked on.) There is rigorous training the leaders go through so they know how to present it to the age groups and how to handle the issues that come up.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to check in your area if either church offers it. While kids initially feel awkward, I haven&#39;t heard a single kid not think it&#39;s wonderful by the end. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want her getting the idea that this is, typical, for lack of a better word<br/>\n&gt; sexual interaction..<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I definitely understand that. *If* these were the only books she had available, she&#39;d be building an image of sexuality from a skewed base. But it sounds like she has a whole bookstore to choose from and that&#39;s what she&#39;s choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you have favorites when you were younger? Bodice busters maybe? You might want to share them with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; UGH! I guess I just need some advice on any or all of<br/>\n&gt; this.

But the way he&#39;s going to meet people with whom he can connect is going to be by doing things he enjoys and finding others who enjoy the same interests. He&#39;s not likely to meet other geeks at a baseball game or mall, and the sorts of places he might meet people with similar interests (anime and comic conventions, for instance) may be too overwhelming for him, depending on how he handles crowds of people he doesn&#39;t know in a new environment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s something to consider when you do take him out - can he bring a laptop or hand-held game along? Or a book if he likes to read. You might not have considered that if you were taking him out for &quot;socialization&quot; but having a game or movie along has been a big, big tool for my daughter in terms of meeting people. She can &quot;hide&quot; behind her thing, focus on the content when she gets overwhelmed by a crowd, and come out slowly, easing in to things. She&#39;s met a couple friends this way - once finding a fellow hiding behind a game of his own and gently striking up a conversation with him about the game itself. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: socialization?","postDate":"1343409121","msgId":48788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1dWk1MSt2MXZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGp1dTFnYyttcjg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48787,"nextInTopic":48789,"prevInTime":48787,"nextInTime":48789,"topicId":48787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************** Does he meet people online?

The internet can be such a marvelous resource for connecting with people who have similar interests. Lots of people make friends over the internet these days. My dad met his second wife over the internet, so I&#39;ve learned to take online relationships seriously ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there chances for your son to meet his online friend in person? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He&#39;s very very VERY awkward due to his Aspergers and I&#39;m very concerned about getting him out there.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI was socially awkward for years - decades! I have a number of friends who were also very awkward when they were young, some of whom still are, and yet they do have people who they care about who care about them, friends and loves and spouses. Some have found their communities online, others through friends. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs he pining for &quot;irl&quot; friends? Or is it you who are worried?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He&#39;s just in a different &quot;world&quot; and most/all don&#39;t understand that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>More than you think! But the way he&#39;s going to meet people with whom he can connect is going to be by doing things he enjoys and finding others who enjoy the same interests. He&#39;s not likely to meet other geeks at a baseball game or mall, and the sorts of places he might meet people with similar interests (anime and comic conventions, for instance) may be too overwhelming for him, depending on how he handles crowds of people he doesn&#39;t know in a new environment. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something to consider when you do take him out - can he bring a laptop or hand-held game along? Or a book if he likes to read.
