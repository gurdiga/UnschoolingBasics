Hopefully I&#39;ll meet you in Pensacola in November? :-)<br/>\nAh, the grandparents and other relatives. They always know what&#39;s <br/>\nbest for our kids, don&#39;t they? <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie&#39;s grandparents and other relatives questioned her too, but <br/>\nthey loved doing it in front of me to make a point (that Laurie was <br/>\nnot learning what THEY thought she should). A school teacher aunt <br/>\nonce asked young Laurie a schoolish question and Laurie told her <br/>\nthat she wasn&#39;t interested in that right now. It took my aunt by <br/>\nsurprise. She expected Laurie to stammer and stutter and say that <br/>\nshe didn&#39;t know. She expected Laurie to be intimidated. The <br/>\nword &quot;intimidated&quot; wasn&#39;t in Laurie&#39;s dictionary. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I notice is that the older generation questions ALL <br/>\nchildren about what they know, not just the unschoolers. When they <br/>\nquestion them, they seem to purposefully avoid questions about what <br/>\nthe children are interested in. They want to broaden their horizons <br/>\nmaybe? Dad used to question Laurie about science and cosmology. He&#39;d <br/>\nquestion me about quantum physics - that didn&#39;t take long. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents have ostracized all of their grandchildren, not just <br/>\nLaurie. They disapprove of anything done differently from the way <br/>\nthey do/did it. Laurie graduating summa cum laude means nothing to <br/>\nthem; the fact that her eyebrow was pierced in her graduation <br/>\npicture meant that pic went straight to the bottom drawer and won&#39;t <br/>\never be displayed with the other family pics. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen relatives started testing Laurie, I watched her to see if she <br/>\nwanted to deal with it. She knew that if she gave me &quot;the look,&quot; I <br/>\nwould step in and tell the tester (if it was a stranger) that what <br/>\nLaurie knows is Laurie&#39;s business and no one elses. If it was a <br/>\nrelative that I like and see regularly, I would start a conversation <br/>\naround the question. For instance, &quot;How much is 1/8 ton?&quot; I&#39;d <br/>\nsay, &quot;Wow, do people really weigh things like that? I&#39;d think if you <br/>\ngot down to 1/8 of a ton, you&#39;d use pounds, unless you&#39;re an <br/>\nelephant.&quot; My interruption would take them offguard, but if they <br/>\nsaid they were directing the question to Laurie, I&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m sure <br/>\nyou could find the answer online if you don&#39;t know it.&quot; (a PERFECT <br/>\nline for nosy testers, no matter what the topic is). I&#39;d keep on <br/>\nthem until my point was made. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was a relative that I REALLY liked, then I would explain to <br/>\nthem the concept of unschooling, not testing, natural learning, etc <br/>\nuntil they were ready to run screaming from the room. Those same <br/>\nrelatives haven&#39;t acknowledged my book. lol <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son handled it well, by telling his uncle that he didn&#39;t need <br/>\nhis help. Maybe you could talk to the uncle and grandparents and <br/>\nexplain to them that you will not allow them to test your son. Tell <br/>\nthem that it upsets your husband and that he doesn&#39;t need that kind <br/>\nof stress. If they choose to ignore you, then it&#39;s up to you and <br/>\nyour children as to whether or not they visit there again. Laurie <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t go to my parents anymore, and my visits are short and <br/>\ninfrequent. I don&#39;t need the stress either. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can&#39;t change the testers, but you can tell them how you feel and <br/>\nnot allow them to test your kids. You might be afraid of causing <br/>\ntension, but the tension is already there. They&#39;re causing it and <br/>\nthey should have to deal with it. Your children are doing nothing <br/>\nwrong and the testers are making them (or attempting to make them) <br/>\nfeel stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had peers tell me that I need to put aside my disappointment <br/>\nwith the attitude of my parents; stop being angry with them for <br/>\ntheir beliefs because they are old, etc. Well, I&#39;m not angry with <br/>\nthem; it was only hurting me. I&#39;m disappointed in them, but I keep <br/>\nit to myself around them. I bite my tongue ALOT around them. They <br/>\nknow nothing about me or Laurie and that&#39;s how they like it. We <br/>\nvisit and discuss whatever they want to discuss (and it&#39;s NEVER <br/>\nabout unschooling, my book or anything real). Tempers stay low and I <br/>\nleave asap. I hug them, tell them I love them and do my head-shaking <br/>\nafter I&#39;m out of sight. It&#39;s easier to do now that Laurie is an <br/>\nadult and they can see she&#39;s doing quite well in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay for you to stand up for your kids against their relatives. <br/>\nIt&#39;s okay for you to protect them from nosy testers. Practice what <br/>\nyou&#39;ll say to them and try to remain calm while saying it. The <br/>\ncalmer you can stay, the more light-hearted you can be and the more <br/>\nconfidence you can exude in a mature voice...the more seriously you <br/>\nwill be taken. If your children can respond to their questions with <br/>\na sense of humor and say &quot;I&#39;m sure you can find that online if you <br/>\ndon&#39;t know the answer,&quot; it&#39;ll be easier for the kids. If the <br/>\nchildren get angry with the questions, then the testers will win. <br/>\nThe main reason they&#39;re testing is to prove that unschooling <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot; Your son getting angry would prove that to THEM. For <br/>\nsome reason adults enjoy making teens angry. Sadistic (*@&#$)*&#%(<br/>\n<br/>\nGive your kids some ammo. Tell them not to let the testers <br/>\nintimidate them. When Laurie was in her late teens and my parents <br/>\nwould test her, she&#39;d just laugh and walk away shaking her head. <br/>\nThey eventually quit asking. Now when they ask her something, she <br/>\nresponds with such a large vocabulary that my mom just looks <br/>\nconfused. She can&#39;t understand what Laurie&#39;s saying. I promise, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t laugh aloud. &lt;g&gt;  I once saw my Dad consult his dictionary <br/>\nafter he talked to Laurie. I have a feeling he was trying to prove <br/>\nher wrong, but she wasn&#39;t. (more silent giggles from me) God, I&#39;m a <br/>\nsnobby sort at times. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope I helped.

We think pleasing the teacher is the same as <br/>\npleasing  ourselves. It isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A&quot; <br/>\nstudents are unfulfilled by  their accomplishment. They feel a void. <br/>\nThey&#39;ve become so adept at pleasing  other people that they forget <br/>\nthey have a self that needs being pleased. My adult students are <br/>\neducationally successful. Most have  doctorates or law degrees. Some <br/>\nappear regularly on TV. All are successful as we  define that <br/>\nconcept. They have played the education game well enough to win <br/>\nsome  of the top prizes. They are all taking lessons because they <br/>\nwant to; nobody is  making them do it. They pay for it themselves. <br/>\nYet they all seem to want to  please me. <br/>\n<br/>\n***** I finally got around to reading this article and it really hit <br/>\na chord with me about Laurie&#39;s college education. She did NOT care <br/>\nabout pleasing the professors. In fact, she debated with them <br/>\nregularly. She had no problem telling them when she thought they <br/>\nwere wrong. She did it politely, but she had no motivation to sit <br/>\nthere and reverently take the professor god&#39;s word as gospel. She <br/>\ndidn&#39;t care if they liked her; she spoke her mind. Because of her <br/>\noutspoken radical self, she did become really good friends with the <br/>\nprofessors that I thought were stronger people than some of the <br/>\nothers. They wanted to be challenged and enjoyed having Laurie in <br/>\ntheir classes. She kept it interesting and kept them on her toes. <br/>\nSeveral times Laurie was asked to teach their classes when they had <br/>\ncar trouble or laryngitis. The weaker professors were intimidated <br/>\nand angered by her comments. &lt;g&gt; But, I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie does please the professors, but only because they are pleased <br/>\nto have a student who actually loves learning. She has essays on her <br/>\ncomputer that she wrote about class topics just for her own sake. No <br/>\none, but me, has ever seen them. She&#39;ll take what she learns in <br/>\nclass and run with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Kelly, (I think) for posting this.

I<br/>\ntalked about how long it took me, and the mistakes I made (and still make<br/>\nsometimes), but it didn&#39;t seem to make any difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of it Dagny said she didn&#39;t think the woman had learned anything.<br/>\nShe was too worried about my reaction to what she was doing to take in any<br/>\nof what I showed her.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175155280,"authorName":"Lanie Carlson-Lim","from":"&quot;Lanie Carlson-Lim&quot; &lt;pyxiewytch@...&gt;","profile":"pyxiewytch68","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Matthew Harre: What I learned...","postDate":"1092240636","msgId":2698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWM0N2ZiZCRiZDIzNGJkMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBMQVJSWT4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlYi4yNzNkNWY2NC4yZTRhZWRjYUBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDAwNDAxYzQ3ZjkwJGU0ZDA2ZmEwJDlmZjlmZWE5QGhhdXB0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":2694,"nextInTopic":2699,"prevInTime":2697,"nextInTime":2699,"topicId":2692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ulrike, I guess my definitions would be a rebel is someone who stands up for what they believe, no matter what popular opinion is...they follow their path","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-914392015\">Ulrike,<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my definitions would be a rebel is someone who stands up for what they believe, no matter what popular opinion is...they follow their path regardless...they may fight for their beliefs if necessary...I would say violence is not always used, but can be to defend ones position when attacked...there are many I would consider &quot;rebels&quot; who were peaceful<br/>\n<br/>\nA terrorist would be someone who uses terror and violence to get what they want or have their beliefs dominate...terror is the tool for getting their way...violence is used as power, not as a defense<br/>\n<br/>\nthese are just my personal definitions, not from a dictionary<br/>\n<br/>\nLanie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":46477013,"authorName":"Ulrike Haupt","from":"&quot;Ulrike Haupt&quot; &lt;rica@...&gt;","profile":"ulrikehaupt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Matthew Harre: What I learned...","postDate":"1092202530","msgId":2694,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDQwMWM0N2Y5MCRlNGQwNmZhMCQ5ZmY5ZmVhOUBoYXVwdD4=","referencesHeader":"PDFlYi4yNzNkNWY2NC4yZTRhZWRjYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2692,"nextInTopic":2698,"prevInTime":2693,"nextInTime":2695,"topicId":2692,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi friends and Kelly Thank you for sending this wonderful article by Matthew Harre to the list.

I meet one to one with my  students. I<br/>\nhave no institution looking over my shoulder. I give no grades. I  work with<br/>\na<br/>\nconstantly fluid situation that requires immediate assessment. As a  result<br/>\nI<br/>\ncan&#39;t plan too far ahead and have great flexibility. I have the  opportunity<br/>\nto get to know my students better than most teachers do.<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is that the bruises  they suffered<br/>\nin their education as children and young adults interferes with  their<br/>\nlearning<br/>\nto play the piano much more than any problems of an aging mind or  body.<br/>\nWhat<br/>\nI have learned to do for my students who are children is to try to do  no<br/>\nharm.<br/>\nI don&#39;t mean that sweet goodie-goodie stuff, that everything&#39;s  &quot;all right&quot;<br/>\nwhen it&#39;s not. I hate that. It&#39;s dishonest and without integrity.  It&#39;s<br/>\nwrong.<br/>\nI&#39;m talking about making corrections with compassion. Letting  students know<br/>\nit&#39;s difficult being corrected, especially when they think they&#39;re  right.<br/>\nLetting them know that I know being wrong can be embarrassing and<br/>\nhumiliating.<br/>\nLetting them know it&#39;s all right to be angry and hurt. Even letting  them<br/>\nknow<br/>\nI won&#39;t be angry with them for being angry with me.<br/>\nI enjoy my adult students very much. I&#39;m struck by their  cautiousness,<br/>\ncarefulness, desire to be perfect, and their utter lack of charity  towards<br/>\nthemselves. Where&#39;s the insatiable curiosity of infancy? Where&#39;s the<br/>\neagerness for<br/>\nadventure? Where&#39;s the willingness to try new things? Where&#39;s the  little<br/>\nkid<br/>\nwho&#39;s willing to fall down over and over again in his desire to learn  to<br/>\nwalk?<br/>\nFor virtually all my adult students, and myself, this has been somehow<br/>\nknocked out of us.<br/>\nHow did we arrive at this state? I believe we got bruised in  many small and<br/>\nbig ways at all levels of our education. People who teach can be<br/>\ninsensitive,<br/>\ninconsiderate and, sometimes, even sadistic. Parents are our  teachers, too,<br/>\nand sometimes they can be the biggest problem.<br/>\nIf you&#39;ll permit me a few moments of gross over-simplifying, I&#39;d  like to<br/>\nmake some observations about our learning. Infants are insatiable in  their<br/>\ncuriosity about the world. They do all kinds of things to find out what&#39;s<br/>\nwhat.<br/>\nUnfortunately, some are dangerous-like chewing on the electrical cord;  some<br/>\nare<br/>\ninconvenient--like flushing their shoes down the toilet to see what<br/>\nhappens;<br/>\nand some of their experiments just don&#39;t fit the timing or moods of the<br/>\npowers that be. All these limitations reign in this unbridled curiosity. I<br/>\nconsider these bruises. They&#39;re little hurts that stopped us and began a<br/>\nlong<br/>\nprocess that took our learning agenda out of our own hands. These limits on<br/>\nour<br/>\ncuriosity may have been necessary from the adult perspective but not,<br/>\ncertainly,<br/>\n from our perspective as a child.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not too long before we become curious about words and  ideas. With this<br/>\ncuriosity comes the necessity of learning to read. What if  you&#39;re<br/>\ninterested<br/>\nin ideas but not interested in reading, or have difficulty  reading? You&#39;re<br/>\nin<br/>\ntrouble in our society.<br/>\nWhen people go to school or take lessons they lose control of  the agenda of<br/>\ntheir curiosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of  learning. The<br/>\nindividual&#39;s curiosity no longer leads. In some places it counts  for<br/>\nnothing.<br/>\nNo matter who we are, how good or bad a student we are, the natural<br/>\ninstincts<br/>\nof our own curiosity suffered many bruises.<br/>\nIn a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our  curiosity were<br/>\ntaken away from us. School is not about rewarding our own  curiosity, it&#39;s<br/>\nabout learning what others want us to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing  teachers.<br/>\nIf we<br/>\nwere successful in school the one thing we had to learn was to  make<br/>\nteachers<br/>\nhappy enough to give us good grades. We may or may not have  learned things<br/>\ninteresting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Successful students  must<br/>\nplease<br/>\nenough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the  process.<br/>\nThen, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own  curiosity, we<br/>\ncome to believe that pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing<br/>\nourselves. We<br/>\nsubstitute learning how we want with learning the way that will  make the<br/>\nteacher happy. We think pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing<br/>\nourselves.<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A&quot; students are unfulfilled by  their<br/>\naccomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so adept at pleasing  other<br/>\npeople that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.<br/>\nMy adult students are educationally successful. Most have  doctorates or law<br/>\ndegrees. Some appear regularly on TV. All are successful as we  define that<br/>\nconcept. They have played the education game well enough to win some  of the<br/>\ntop<br/>\nprizes. They are all taking lessons because they want to; nobody is  making<br/>\nthem do it. They pay for it themselves. Yet they all seem to want to  please<br/>\nme. Well ... I&#39;m not a Ph.D. and I was not a particularly successful<br/>\nstudent.<br/>\nSo why are all these brilliant people interested in pleasing me?<br/>\nI must confess, it&#39;s been a gradually unfolding shock to me to  realize how<br/>\ncrucial it is for them to make me happy. Fortunately or  unfortunately, I<br/>\nthought I was supposed to make them happy so they&#39;d keep on  hiring me and<br/>\nI&#39;d have<br/>\na job. I seemed to have missed the point entirely. I  hadn&#39;t realized how<br/>\nmuch power I had; how much power they gave me. If making the  teacher happy<br/>\nis<br/>\nwhat it&#39;s all about, and I&#39;m the teacher--it&#39;s my power trip.<br/>\nFor whatever reasons make me the person I am, I don&#39;t feel the  need for<br/>\nthis<br/>\npower trip. Certainly part of the reason has to do with the  teachers I had,<br/>\nat least in music. I teach because I want to be part of the mix  of the<br/>\nworld<br/>\nof music and the world of my individual student&#39;s mind. It is a  fascinating<br/>\nplace to be. I don&#39;t feel the need to control or force the outcome.  I do<br/>\nwant<br/>\nmy students to be pleased with their work in music.<br/>\nYou would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students  to be<br/>\npleased with their work. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk<br/>\nto<br/>\nthemselves that I really began to realize how much their past education had<br/>\ntaken<br/>\nfrom them. When they make mistakes they say things like: &quot;That was  stupid,&quot;<br/>\n&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; The condescension in their<br/>\nvoices<br/>\nis impressive. They are not talking to themselves with their own voices;<br/>\nthey<br/>\nare talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers and parents.<br/>\nPonder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did<br/>\nthey<br/>\nabandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?<br/>\nOne of my adult students was playing for me and playing well,  with feeling.<br/>\nI was enjoying her playing. All of a sudden she yelled, &quot;No, no  that&#39;s not<br/>\nright!&quot; I was startled. I hadn&#39;t even heard the mistake. Less than a  minute<br/>\nlater the same thing happened. Again I was startled but also annoyed. I  was<br/>\nenjoying her playing and concentrating on it-when this scream interrupted.<br/>\nWhen<br/>\nit happened a third time I was angry. I stopped her and said, &quot;You keep<br/>\ngetting me involved in your playing and then scare me with your screaming.<br/>\nWhat  are<br/>\nyou doing?&quot; &quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll stop. I didn&#39;t realize I<br/>\nwas bothering you.&quot;<br/>\nShe apologized for bothering me. Adults apologize to teachers a  lot. What I<br/>\nrealized, and what we talked about, was that what I felt must have  been how<br/>\nshe felt when she was playing for her teacher as a child. She&#39;d be  intently<br/>\ninvolved in her music-making when the teacher would yell and scare her.  In<br/>\nthe<br/>\npresent case, I was the teacher. I could get annoyed and tell her to  quit.<br/>\nBut when it happened to her, she was the child and the student. If she&#39;d<br/>\nreacted to her teacher as I reacted to her, she would have been called rude<br/>\nand<br/>\nimpudent and this particular teacher would have hit her. I&#39;ve seen this<br/>\nwoman<br/>\nmake a mistake and cover her head to ward off the impending blow.<br/>\nHow can a person be totally involved in their learning if they  are waiting<br/>\nfor someone to yell at them or hit them? A part of them must always  be<br/>\nwatching and waiting for the interruption or attack. I don&#39;t yell at my<br/>\nstudents,<br/>\nyoung or old.<br/>\nThe final irony of this sad tale is that the woman was her  teacher&#39;s best<br/>\nstudent. She was working on Beethoven&#39;s Pathetique Sonata at the  age of 12.<br/>\nHer<br/>\nteacher had never had such a gifted student. Why did she feel the  need to<br/>\ntreat her student this way? People do not understand that being a  teacher&#39;s<br/>\nbest student can bring with it a number of disadvantages. Educational<br/>\nproblems<br/>\nare always assumed to be the domain of lesser students, but there is a<br/>\nwhole<br/>\nraft of problems the really good students experience. Teachers push them<br/>\ntoo<br/>\nfast and too far, beyond what they can really experience. Teachers become<br/>\npossessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment. Teachers<br/>\nover-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have<br/>\na  fulfilling<br/>\nlife of their own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.<br/>\nThe woman I&#39;m talking about is not an educational failure. She  has her<br/>\nPh.D.<br/>\nand was president of a small Midwestern college for several years  before<br/>\ntaking lessons with me. She has achieved much in educational circles<br/>\nincluding<br/>\npower over teachers. Clearly this accomplishment has done nothing to  erase<br/>\nthe<br/>\nimpact of her childhood piano teacher. The power of this early  experience<br/>\nis<br/>\ntenacious. It will take time and work to move beyond the  experience.<br/>\nAnother example of the tenaciousness of this kind of abuse was  told by<br/>\nanother adult student of mine at the 10th anniversary celebration of the<br/>\nAdult<br/>\nMusic Student Forum. Tom read the following: &quot;The man you see before you<br/>\nnow is<br/>\napproaching his sixties. And yet, he can remember with stark clarity the<br/>\nsevere brutalization that he endured for nearly a full year when he was a<br/>\nmere<br/>\nslip of a lad in his second year of elementary school. This torture he<br/>\nsuffered<br/>\nat the hands of none other than his piano teacher, one Sister Mary<br/>\nFlorentine.<br/>\n&quot;Sister Mary Florentine&#39;s most notable trait as a music teacher  was a truly<br/>\nremarkable intolerance for wrong notes. To say she was a stickler  for<br/>\nperfection just doesn&#39;t fully capture it. During lessons she would usually<br/>\nstand<br/>\nbehind and a little to the right of the student, gently cradling her  weapon<br/>\nof<br/>\nchoice. That, of course, was the standard issue twelve-inch wooden  ruler<br/>\nwith<br/>\nthe embedded brass straightedge. She would position herself<br/>\nstrategically-just beyond the student&#39;s range of peripheral vision and just<br/>\nwithin striking<br/>\ndistance of the keyboard.<br/>\n&quot;Imagine yourself in this tableau-a young innocent boy, hands  poised just<br/>\nabove the keyboard with its hundreds of nicks and notches reflecting<br/>\ndecades of<br/>\nwrong notes, each quickly followed by errant ruler strikes or  ricochets.<br/>\nImagine the strikes that found their intended targets. Imagine  yourself<br/>\nplaying<br/>\nThe Blue Danube Waltz in that situation.<br/>\n&quot;Now fast forward about forty years. My family and career were  by now well<br/>\nestablished. My life was on course and cruising along. Yet there  remained a<br/>\nvague gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach--something missing or<br/>\nunresolved. It eventually evolved into a desire to take piano lessons.<br/>\n&quot;My memory of the experience with Sister Mary Florentine formed  the basis<br/>\nof<br/>\nmy expectations regarding lessons with Matt. For example, I  naturally<br/>\nexpected some form of torture to be an integral part of each lesson...<br/>\n&quot;But even from the first lesson it was clear that Matt was no  Sister Mary<br/>\nFlorentine. For example, during lessons he seated himself  practically all<br/>\nthe<br/>\nway across the room, way beyond striking range. Some of  Matt&#39;s<br/>\nidiosyncrasies<br/>\nwere a little confusing at first. Consider his seating  arrangements-highly<br/>\nvaried and always interesting. When he conducted lessons  while seated on a<br/>\nmedicine ball, I found myself occasionally wondering how he  could throw the<br/>\nmedicine ball at me while he was seated on it. I feared there  might be some<br/>\ntrick.<br/>\nMy frame of reference did not permit me to imagine that he  might simply be<br/>\ntrying to ease his back pain.<br/>\n&quot;I cannot say that any of his approaches was particularly  effective for me,<br/>\nbut all of them together seemed to have considerable benefit.  After two or<br/>\nthree years, I found myself actually focusing on the music. With  Matt&#39;s<br/>\ncontinued teaching ... I found myself playing at least elementary pieces<br/>\nwith actual<br/>\nenjoyment.&quot;<br/>\nFor Tom as the second-grader, getting right notes was not for  the joy of<br/>\nthe<br/>\nsound, not for the joy of physical mastery, not for the joy of  learning.<br/>\nGetting right notes was to keep from being hurt. What he learned was  not<br/>\nabout<br/>\nmusic but about self-preservation. What he learned was that some  teachers<br/>\nare<br/>\nmean and will hurt you. Here success is not about feeling good  about<br/>\nyourself; it&#39;s about being hit less.<br/>\nTom and I have been friends for at least ten years. I taught his  daughter<br/>\npiano for some time. I had known her from birth. We would all go  Christmas<br/>\ncaroling every year together with other neighbors, then go back to  their<br/>\nhome for<br/>\nIrish coffee. He knew the kind of person I am.<br/>\nBut this knowledge became irrelevant when Tom started taking  lessons. What<br/>\nTom knew of me could not erase the terror of his earlier  experience. The<br/>\nhistory that was relevant was the horror of his earlier piano  lessons. When<br/>\nI was<br/>\nteaching Tom, I lost my identity to Sister Mary Florentine.  It took Tom two<br/>\nor three years to actually focus on the music. It took that much  time to<br/>\nundo<br/>\nthe meanness of his earlier teacher.<br/>\nThe tragedy is that people who are abused come to identify with  the abuser<br/>\nand feel they should be abused; they deserve it. Compassion is hard  to<br/>\naccept.<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons my adult students talk to themselves as  they do.<br/>\nYou may now better understand why I say what I try to do for my young<br/>\nstudents<br/>\nis to do no harm.<br/>\nThe yelling, hitting, and condescending nuances are all  humiliating and<br/>\nembarrassing. This humiliation seems to be a common part of  everybody&#39;s<br/>\neducation. Everybody I&#39;ve talked to about what I planned to say  today has<br/>\nhis or her<br/>\nown set of examples. They usually haven&#39;t thought to ponder  them, but<br/>\nrather,<br/>\nregarded them as an assumption of the whole process. Everybody  has<br/>\nexperienced this embarrassment. By high school the kids started doing the<br/>\nsame thing to<br/>\neach other. One outcome of this is anger-fear and anger. I want to  return<br/>\nto<br/>\nthis in a minute but first there seems to be a special humiliation we<br/>\nexperienced as students.<br/>\nThat humiliation came from thinking we were right when we were  wrong. The<br/>\nteacher pulled the rug out from under us by telling us (and everybody  else)<br/>\nthat we were wrong, that we didn&#39;t have a clue, missed the whole point,<br/>\nwere<br/>\nstupid or whatever. The implied corollary was &quot;pride goeth before a fall.&quot;<br/>\nI<br/>\ncannot get my adult students to say they played well. They think I&#39;m going<br/>\nto<br/>\nsay their playing was awful. They think I&#39;m trying to set them up for this<br/>\nembarrassment. They think that because it&#39;s happened to them before.<br/>\nRecently, I had a student confess to thinking she played a piece  well for<br/>\nme. There was something negative I wanted to point out so I knew I was  in<br/>\ntrouble. I tried to head it off but I failed. I said five things that were<br/>\ntruthful and positive about her performance. I said one thing needed work.<br/>\nShe  never<br/>\nheard the five good things, only the one bad.<br/>\nEverything I feared came pouring out. I&#39;d set her up; I&#39;d  embarrassed her;<br/>\nI<br/>\nwas just trying to show her how little she knew compared to  me ... all of<br/>\nit. What she said was that I was like all her other teachers, and  having a<br/>\nPh.D., she&#39;d had a lot of teachers. She was really angry with me and<br/>\nembarrassed<br/>\nby her anger. But she was angry and we talked about it and the  discussions<br/>\nwent on for probably three lessons. Neither one of us capitulated  but each<br/>\nclarified what we&#39;d said and felt. Her anger freed something in her and  her<br/>\nplaying became significantly better in the week that followed. I&#39;ve had this<br/>\nexperience before. Release of anger at the teacher seems to free students to<br/>\ninvest themselves more fully. I don&#39;t fully understand this. Perhaps the<br/>\ntruthfulness of the anger and the teacher&#39;s acceptance of that anger allow<br/>\nthe  student<br/>\na deeper level of commitment.<br/>\nMy favorite story about anger at teachers is my own experience:<br/>\nI took my one and only viola lesson a couple years ago with  Rodger<br/>\nEllsworth, the son of the man who ran Ellsworth Studio over on Willow  Lane.<br/>\nThe<br/>\ndifference was the teacher was my friend. Rodger dropped in one  evening<br/>\nafter a<br/>\nperformance at the Kennedy Center asking if I wanted a viola  lesson. I<br/>\nsaid, &quot;Of<br/>\ncourse not.&quot; In principle it was a fine idea but I had a  thousand reasons<br/>\nfor not wanting to do it. Rodger persisted, saying it would be  a good way<br/>\nto<br/>\nknow what my adult students felt like and other such reasonable  nonsense. I<br/>\nrelented and took my first lesson. The result was not as I expected  at all.<br/>\nTensely, I put the viola under my chin and the bow in hand. I  started to<br/>\nlisten to his many instructions, some of which seemed contradictory  to me.<br/>\nWhat<br/>\nI didn&#39;t expect was I got really furious. I told him he didn&#39;t know  how to<br/>\nteach; that I was going to take this viola and smash it over his head and<br/>\nother<br/>\nsuch violence. I was livid. Being the friend he was, Rodger was able to<br/>\naccept all this, calmly.<br/>\nWhen I finished my outburst and settled down I found I was  drawing the bow<br/>\nover the strings with an ease and firmness I had not imagined  possible.<br/>\nMy outburst of anger apparently released my frustration at being  in an<br/>\nawkward situation, feeling out of control, and feeling inferior. Having<br/>\ndischarged<br/>\nthat tension I was free to engage in the learning activity fully,  without<br/>\ndistraction. Rodger was a friend. I knew I could be angry with him. Had  I<br/>\nbeen<br/>\nworking with a regular teacher, there would have been no such outburst. I<br/>\nwould have been the usual polite student. I would have been stuck with my<br/>\nanger<br/>\nand I would not have learned nearly as fast or as much. This is the position<br/>\nof  most students.<br/>\nI encourage my young students to vent their anger at music,  practicing, and<br/>\nme. I let them know I am strong enough to take it and won&#39;t get  mad at them<br/>\nfor telling me. When it happens, and it&#39;s not often, I don&#39;t take  their<br/>\nanger<br/>\npersonally. I don&#39;t feel they&#39;re being rude or impudent. I know that  to<br/>\nreally love something you have to have the freedom to sometimes hate it.<br/>\nAnother of my favorite stories is about Clare. This is an  example of what I<br/>\nlearned about teaching children from teaching adults. I was  ready and I<br/>\nfinally handled one of these situations right.<br/>\nI was working with Clare, and it happened to be her 7th  birthday. She was<br/>\nin<br/>\nher second year of piano. Clare is fun, smart, honest, and  polite. She<br/>\nplayed her piece for me with the right hand playing one note higher  than<br/>\nwritten.<br/>\nInstead of &quot;B&quot; she started on &quot;C,&quot; etc. Though it didn&#39;t sound  quite right,<br/>\nit didn&#39;t sound too bad either. Clare thought it sounded fine. I  asked her<br/>\nto<br/>\nplay the right hand one note lower, i.e. the correct way, and she  thought<br/>\nthat sounded weird. She played it again the wrong way and found it  better.<br/>\nIn<br/>\nother words, she played wrong all week. Thinking she was right, she  was<br/>\npleased<br/>\nwith herself and her work.<br/>\nI told Clare I hated to tell her but she played all the  right-hand notes<br/>\none<br/>\nnote too high. Clare was silent but her big brown eyes  filled with tears. I<br/>\napologized and told her I felt it was important to be  honest with her.<br/>\nI asked her if she felt dumb and stupid and she said, &quot;Sort of.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Does it make you mad?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Sort of.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Do you feel it in your body anywhere?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Well, do you feel it in your chest or stomach?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Both.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;It hurts doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>\nRecently I asked Clare if I could tell this story in a talk I  was giving.<br/>\nShe said sure but she didn&#39;t remember the incident. To Clare, it was  not a<br/>\nmemorable event. That&#39;s exactly the way it should have been. Had I<br/>\nunleashed any<br/>\nof those lines teachers are famous for like &quot;How could you have  made that<br/>\nsame stupid mistake all week long? Do you ever look at the notes?,&quot; I  think<br/>\nshe&#39;d have remembered. She was already embarrassed by her mistake and her<br/>\nassumption of correctness. What I did was to &quot;hold her hand&quot; while she got<br/>\nin  touch<br/>\nwith how really rotten it did feel, right into her chest and stomach. With<br/>\nboth of us accepting all these feelings she could then let go of them and we<br/>\ncould move on.<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is how much our  education hurts,<br/>\nhow much we all suffered to get where we are, and how much  teachers&#39;<br/>\nremembrance of their own history makes them repeat it rather than  correct<br/>\nit. What I&#39;ve<br/>\nlearned is how rare is the consideration of students&#39;  feelings, not<br/>\nwithstanding some wonderful exceptions.<br/>\nMost of all, I&#39;ve learned the value of compassion in education,  allowing<br/>\nthe<br/>\nstudents the space to learn and know all the diverse emotions  involved in<br/>\nlearning. It&#39;s not dramatic; it&#39;s just kind. It doesn&#39;t call  attention to<br/>\nitself; it does no harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I meet one to one with my  students. I <br/>\nhave no institution looking over my shoulder. I give no grades. I  work with a <br/>\nconstantly fluid situation that requires immediate assessment. As a  result I <br/>\ncan&#39;t plan too far ahead and have great flexibility. I have the  opportunity <br/>\nto get to know my students better than most teachers do.  <br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is that the bruises  they suffered <br/>\nin their education as children and young adults interferes with  their learning <br/>\nto play the piano much more than any problems of an aging mind or  body. What <br/>\nI have learned to do for my students who are children is to try to do  no <br/>\nharm.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t mean that sweet goodie-goodie stuff, that everything&#39;s  &quot;all right&quot; <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s not. I hate that. It&#39;s dishonest and without integrity.  It&#39;s wrong.  <br/>\nI&#39;m talking about making corrections with compassion. Letting  students know <br/>\nit&#39;s difficult being corrected, especially when they think they&#39;re  right. <br/>\nLetting them know that I know being wrong can be embarrassing and  humiliating. <br/>\nLetting them know it&#39;s all right to be angry and hurt. Even letting  them know <br/>\nI won&#39;t be angry with them for being angry with me.  <br/>\nI enjoy my adult students very much. I&#39;m struck by their  cautiousness, <br/>\ncarefulness, desire to be perfect, and their utter lack of charity  towards <br/>\nthemselves. Where&#39;s the insatiable curiosity of infancy? Where&#39;s the  eagerness for <br/>\nadventure? Where&#39;s the willingness to try new things? Where&#39;s the  little kid <br/>\nwho&#39;s willing to fall down over and over again in his desire to learn  to walk? <br/>\nFor virtually all my adult students, and myself, this has been somehow  <br/>\nknocked out of us.  <br/>\nHow did we arrive at this state? I believe we got bruised in  many small and <br/>\nbig ways at all levels of our education. People who teach can be  insensitive, <br/>\ninconsiderate and, sometimes, even sadistic. Parents are our  teachers, too, <br/>\nand sometimes they can be the biggest problem.  <br/>\nIf you&#39;ll permit me a few moments of gross over-simplifying, I&#39;d  like to <br/>\nmake some observations about our learning. Infants are insatiable in  their <br/>\ncuriosity about the world. They do all kinds of things to find out what&#39;s  what. <br/>\nUnfortunately, some are dangerous-like chewing on the electrical cord;  some are <br/>\ninconvenient--like flushing their shoes down the toilet to see what  happens; <br/>\nand some of their experiments just don&#39;t fit the timing or moods of the  <br/>\npowers that be. All these limitations reign in this unbridled curiosity. I  <br/>\nconsider these bruises. They&#39;re little hurts that stopped us and began a long  <br/>\nprocess that took our learning agenda out of our own hands. These limits on our  <br/>\ncuriosity may have been necessary from the adult perspective but not, certainly, <br/>\n from our perspective as a child.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s not too long before we become curious about words and  ideas. With this <br/>\ncuriosity comes the necessity of learning to read. What if  you&#39;re interested <br/>\nin ideas but not interested in reading, or have difficulty  reading? You&#39;re in <br/>\ntrouble in our society.  <br/>\nWhen people go to school or take lessons they lose control of  the agenda of <br/>\ntheir curiosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of  learning. The <br/>\nindividual&#39;s curiosity no longer leads. In some places it counts  for nothing. <br/>\nNo matter who we are, how good or bad a student we are, the natural  instincts <br/>\nof our own curiosity suffered many bruises.  <br/>\nIn a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our  curiosity were <br/>\ntaken away from us. School is not about rewarding our own  curiosity, it&#39;s <br/>\nabout learning what others want us to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing  teachers. If we <br/>\nwere successful in school the one thing we had to learn was to  make teachers <br/>\nhappy enough to give us good grades. We may or may not have  learned things <br/>\ninteresting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Successful students  must please <br/>\nenough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the  process.  <br/>\nThen, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own  curiosity, we <br/>\ncome to believe that pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing  ourselves. We <br/>\nsubstitute learning how we want with learning the way that will  make the <br/>\nteacher happy. We think pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing  ourselves. <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A&quot; students are unfulfilled by  their <br/>\naccomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so adept at pleasing  other <br/>\npeople that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.  <br/>\nMy adult students are educationally successful. Most have  doctorates or law <br/>\ndegrees. Some appear regularly on TV. All are successful as we  define that <br/>\nconcept. They have played the education game well enough to win some  of the top <br/>\nprizes. They are all taking lessons because they want to; nobody is  making <br/>\nthem do it. They pay for it themselves. Yet they all seem to want to  please <br/>\nme. Well ... I&#39;m not a Ph.D. and I was not a particularly successful  student. <br/>\nSo why are all these brilliant people interested in pleasing me?  <br/>\nI must confess, it&#39;s been a gradually unfolding shock to me to  realize how <br/>\ncrucial it is for them to make me happy. Fortunately or  unfortunately, I <br/>\nthought I was supposed to make them happy so they&#39;d keep on  hiring me and I&#39;d have <br/>\na job. I seemed to have missed the point entirely. I  hadn&#39;t realized how <br/>\nmuch power I had; how much power they gave me. If making the  teacher happy is <br/>\nwhat it&#39;s all about, and I&#39;m the teacher--it&#39;s my power trip.  <br/>\nFor whatever reasons make me the person I am, I don&#39;t feel the  need for this <br/>\npower trip. Certainly part of the reason has to do with the  teachers I had, <br/>\nat least in music. I teach because I want to be part of the mix  of the world <br/>\nof music and the world of my individual student&#39;s mind. It is a  fascinating <br/>\nplace to be. I don&#39;t feel the need to control or force the outcome.  I do want <br/>\nmy students to be pleased with their work in music.  <br/>\nYou would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students  to be <br/>\npleased with their work. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk  to <br/>\nthemselves that I really began to realize how much their past education had  taken <br/>\nfrom them. When they make mistakes they say things like: &quot;That was  stupid,&quot; <br/>\n&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; The condescension in their  voices <br/>\nis impressive. They are not talking to themselves with their own voices;  they <br/>\nare talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers and parents.  <br/>\nPonder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did they  <br/>\nabandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?  <br/>\nOne of my adult students was playing for me and playing well,  with feeling. <br/>\nI was enjoying her playing. All of a sudden she yelled, &quot;No, no  that&#39;s not <br/>\nright!&quot; I was startled. I hadn&#39;t even heard the mistake. Less than a  minute <br/>\nlater the same thing happened. Again I was startled but also annoyed. I  was <br/>\nenjoying her playing and concentrating on it-when this scream interrupted.  When <br/>\nit happened a third time I was angry. I stopped her and said, &quot;You keep  <br/>\ngetting me involved in your playing and then scare me with your screaming. What  are <br/>\nyou doing?&quot; &quot;Sorry, sorry, sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll stop. I didn&#39;t realize I  <br/>\nwas bothering you.&quot;  <br/>\nShe apologized for bothering me. Adults apologize to teachers a  lot. What I <br/>\nrealized, and what we talked about, was that what I felt must have  been how <br/>\nshe felt when she was playing for her teacher as a child. She&#39;d be  intently <br/>\ninvolved in her music-making when the teacher would yell and scare her.  In the <br/>\npresent case, I was the teacher. I could get annoyed and tell her to  quit. <br/>\nBut when it happened to her, she was the child and the student. If she&#39;d  <br/>\nreacted to her teacher as I reacted to her, she would have been called rude and  <br/>\nimpudent and this particular teacher would have hit her. I&#39;ve seen this woman  <br/>\nmake a mistake and cover her head to ward off the impending blow.  <br/>\nHow can a person be totally involved in their learning if they  are waiting <br/>\nfor someone to yell at them or hit them? A part of them must always  be <br/>\nwatching and waiting for the interruption or attack. I don&#39;t yell at my  students, <br/>\nyoung or old.  <br/>\nThe final irony of this sad tale is that the woman was her  teacher&#39;s best <br/>\nstudent. She was working on Beethoven&#39;s Pathetique Sonata at the  age of 12. Her <br/>\nteacher had never had such a gifted student. Why did she feel the  need to <br/>\ntreat her student this way? People do not understand that being a  teacher&#39;s <br/>\nbest student can bring with it a number of disadvantages. Educational  problems <br/>\nare always assumed to be the domain of lesser students, but there is a  whole <br/>\nraft of problems the really good students experience. Teachers push them  too <br/>\nfast and too far, beyond what they can really experience. Teachers become  <br/>\npossessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment. Teachers  <br/>\nover-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have a  fulfilling <br/>\nlife of their own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.  <br/>\nThe woman I&#39;m talking about is not an educational failure. She  has her Ph.D. <br/>\nand was president of a small Midwestern college for several years  before <br/>\ntaking lessons with me. She has achieved much in educational circles  including <br/>\npower over teachers. Clearly this accomplishment has done nothing to  erase the <br/>\nimpact of her childhood piano teacher. The power of this early  experience is <br/>\ntenacious. It will take time and work to move beyond the  experience.  <br/>\nAnother example of the tenaciousness of this kind of abuse was  told by <br/>\nanother adult student of mine at the 10th anniversary celebration of the  Adult <br/>\nMusic Student Forum. Tom read the following: &quot;The man you see before you  now is <br/>\napproaching his sixties. And yet, he can remember with stark clarity the  <br/>\nsevere brutalization that he endured for nearly a full year when he was a mere  <br/>\nslip of a lad in his second year of elementary school. This torture he suffered  <br/>\nat the hands of none other than his piano teacher, one Sister Mary <br/>\nFlorentine.  <br/>\n&quot;Sister Mary Florentine&#39;s most notable trait as a music teacher  was a truly <br/>\nremarkable intolerance for wrong notes. To say she was a stickler  for <br/>\nperfection just doesn&#39;t fully capture it. During lessons she would usually  stand <br/>\nbehind and a little to the right of the student, gently cradling her  weapon of <br/>\nchoice. That, of course, was the standard issue twelve-inch wooden  ruler with <br/>\nthe embedded brass straightedge. She would position herself  <br/>\nstrategically-just beyond the student&#39;s range of peripheral vision and just  within striking <br/>\ndistance of the keyboard.  <br/>\n&quot;Imagine yourself in this tableau-a young innocent boy, hands  poised just <br/>\nabove the keyboard with its hundreds of nicks and notches reflecting  decades of <br/>\nwrong notes, each quickly followed by errant ruler strikes or  ricochets. <br/>\nImagine the strikes that found their intended targets. Imagine  yourself playing <br/>\nThe Blue Danube Waltz in that situation.  <br/>\n&quot;Now fast forward about forty years. My family and career were  by now well <br/>\nestablished. My life was on course and cruising along. Yet there  remained a <br/>\nvague gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach--something missing or  <br/>\nunresolved. It eventually evolved into a desire to take piano lessons.  <br/>\n&quot;My memory of the experience with Sister Mary Florentine formed  the basis of <br/>\nmy expectations regarding lessons with Matt. For example, I  naturally <br/>\nexpected some form of torture to be an integral part of each lesson...   <br/>\n&quot;But even from the first lesson it was clear that Matt was no  Sister Mary <br/>\nFlorentine. For example, during lessons he seated himself  practically all the <br/>\nway across the room, way beyond striking range. Some of  Matt&#39;s idiosyncrasies <br/>\nwere a little confusing at first. Consider his seating  arrangements-highly <br/>\nvaried and always interesting. When he conducted lessons  while seated on a <br/>\nmedicine ball, I found myself occasionally wondering how he  could throw the <br/>\nmedicine ball at me while he was seated on it. I feared there  might be some trick. <br/>\nMy frame of reference did not permit me to imagine that he  might simply be <br/>\ntrying to ease his back pain.  <br/>\n&quot;I cannot say that any of his approaches was particularly  effective for me, <br/>\nbut all of them together seemed to have considerable benefit.  After two or <br/>\nthree years, I found myself actually focusing on the music. With  Matt&#39;s <br/>\ncontinued teaching ... I found myself playing at least elementary pieces  with actual <br/>\nenjoyment.&quot;  <br/>\nFor Tom as the second-grader, getting right notes was not for  the joy of the <br/>\nsound, not for the joy of physical mastery, not for the joy of  learning. <br/>\nGetting right notes was to keep from being hurt. What he learned was  not about <br/>\nmusic but about self-preservation. What he learned was that some  teachers are <br/>\nmean and will hurt you. Here success is not about feeling good  about <br/>\nyourself; it&#39;s about being hit less.  <br/>\nTom and I have been friends for at least ten years. I taught his  daughter <br/>\npiano for some time. I had known her from birth. We would all go  Christmas <br/>\ncaroling every year together with other neighbors, then go back to  their home for <br/>\nIrish coffee. He knew the kind of person I am.  <br/>\nBut this knowledge became irrelevant when Tom started taking  lessons. What <br/>\nTom knew of me could not erase the terror of his earlier  experience. The <br/>\nhistory that was relevant was the horror of his earlier piano  lessons. When I was <br/>\nteaching Tom, I lost my identity to Sister Mary Florentine.  It took Tom two <br/>\nor three years to actually focus on the music. It took that much  time to undo <br/>\nthe meanness of his earlier teacher.  <br/>\nThe tragedy is that people who are abused come to identify with  the abuser <br/>\nand feel they should be abused; they deserve it. Compassion is hard  to accept. <br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons my adult students talk to themselves as  they do. <br/>\nYou may now better understand why I say what I try to do for my young  students <br/>\nis to do no harm.  <br/>\nThe yelling, hitting, and condescending nuances are all  humiliating and <br/>\nembarrassing. This humiliation seems to be a common part of  everybody&#39;s <br/>\neducation. Everybody I&#39;ve talked to about what I planned to say  today has his or her <br/>\nown set of examples. They usually haven&#39;t thought to ponder  them, but rather, <br/>\nregarded them as an assumption of the whole process. Everybody  has <br/>\nexperienced this embarrassment. By high school the kids started doing the  same thing to <br/>\neach other. One outcome of this is anger-fear and anger. I want to  return to <br/>\nthis in a minute but first there seems to be a special humiliation we  <br/>\nexperienced as students.  <br/>\nThat humiliation came from thinking we were right when we were  wrong. The <br/>\nteacher pulled the rug out from under us by telling us (and everybody  else) <br/>\nthat we were wrong, that we didn&#39;t have a clue, missed the whole point,  were <br/>\nstupid or whatever. The implied corollary was &quot;pride goeth before a fall.&quot;  I <br/>\ncannot get my adult students to say they played well. They think I&#39;m going to  <br/>\nsay their playing was awful. They think I&#39;m trying to set them up for this  <br/>\nembarrassment. They think that because it&#39;s happened to them before.  <br/>\nRecently, I had a student confess to thinking she played a piece  well for <br/>\nme. There was something negative I wanted to point out so I knew I was  in <br/>\ntrouble. I tried to head it off but I failed. I said five things that were  <br/>\ntruthful and positive about her performance. I said one thing needed work. She  never <br/>\nheard the five good things, only the one bad.  <br/>\nEverything I feared came pouring out. I&#39;d set her up; I&#39;d  embarrassed her; I <br/>\nwas just trying to show her how little she knew compared to  me ... all of <br/>\nit. What she said was that I was like all her other teachers, and  having a <br/>\nPh.D., she&#39;d had a lot of teachers. She was really angry with me and  embarrassed <br/>\nby her anger. But she was angry and we talked about it and the  discussions <br/>\nwent on for probably three lessons. Neither one of us capitulated  but each <br/>\nclarified what we&#39;d said and felt. Her anger freed something in her and  her <br/>\nplaying became significantly better in the week that followed. I&#39;ve had this  <br/>\nexperience before. Release of anger at the teacher seems to free students to  <br/>\ninvest themselves more fully. I don&#39;t fully understand this. Perhaps the  <br/>\ntruthfulness of the anger and the teacher&#39;s acceptance of that anger allow the  student <br/>\na deeper level of commitment.  <br/>\nMy favorite story about anger at teachers is my own experience:  <br/>\nI took my one and only viola lesson a couple years ago with  Rodger <br/>\nEllsworth, the son of the man who ran Ellsworth Studio over on Willow  Lane. The <br/>\ndifference was the teacher was my friend. Rodger dropped in one  evening after a <br/>\nperformance at the Kennedy Center asking if I wanted a viola  lesson. I said, &quot;Of <br/>\ncourse not.&quot; In principle it was a fine idea but I had a  thousand reasons <br/>\nfor not wanting to do it. Rodger persisted, saying it would be  a good way to <br/>\nknow what my adult students felt like and other such reasonable  nonsense. I <br/>\nrelented and took my first lesson. The result was not as I expected  at all.  <br/>\nTensely, I put the viola under my chin and the bow in hand. I  started to <br/>\nlisten to his many instructions, some of which seemed contradictory  to me. What <br/>\nI didn&#39;t expect was I got really furious. I told him he didn&#39;t know  how to <br/>\nteach; that I was going to take this viola and smash it over his head and  other <br/>\nsuch violence. I was livid. Being the friend he was, Rodger was able to  <br/>\naccept all this, calmly.  <br/>\nWhen I finished my outburst and settled down I found I was  drawing the bow <br/>\nover the strings with an ease and firmness I had not imagined  possible.  <br/>\nMy outburst of anger apparently released my frustration at being  in an <br/>\nawkward situation, feeling out of control, and feeling inferior. Having  discharged <br/>\nthat tension I was free to engage in the learning activity fully,  without <br/>\ndistraction. Rodger was a friend. I knew I could be angry with him. Had  I been <br/>\nworking with a regular teacher, there would have been no such outburst. I  <br/>\nwould have been the usual polite student. I would have been stuck with my anger  <br/>\nand I would not have learned nearly as fast or as much. This is the position <br/>\nof  most students.  <br/>\nI encourage my young students to vent their anger at music,  practicing, and <br/>\nme. I let them know I am strong enough to take it and won&#39;t get  mad at them <br/>\nfor telling me. When it happens, and it&#39;s not often, I don&#39;t take  their anger <br/>\npersonally. I don&#39;t feel they&#39;re being rude or impudent. I know that  to <br/>\nreally love something you have to have the freedom to sometimes hate it.  <br/>\nAnother of my favorite stories is about Clare. This is an  example of what I <br/>\nlearned about teaching children from teaching adults. I was  ready and I <br/>\nfinally handled one of these situations right.  <br/>\nI was working with Clare, and it happened to be her 7th  birthday. She was in <br/>\nher second year of piano. Clare is fun, smart, honest, and  polite. She <br/>\nplayed her piece for me with the right hand playing one note higher  than written. <br/>\nInstead of &quot;B&quot; she started on &quot;C,&quot; etc. Though it didn&#39;t sound  quite right, <br/>\nit didn&#39;t sound too bad either. Clare thought it sounded fine. I  asked her to <br/>\nplay the right hand one note lower, i.e. the correct way, and she  thought <br/>\nthat sounded weird. She played it again the wrong way and found it  better. In <br/>\nother words, she played wrong all week. Thinking she was right, she  was pleased <br/>\nwith herself and her work.  <br/>\nI told Clare I hated to tell her but she played all the  right-hand notes one <br/>\nnote too high. Clare was silent but her big brown eyes  filled with tears. I <br/>\napologized and told her I felt it was important to be  honest with her.  <br/>\nI asked her if she felt dumb and stupid and she said, &quot;Sort of.&quot;   <br/>\n&quot;Does it make you mad?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Sort of.&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Do you feel it in your body anywhere?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Well, do you feel it in your chest or stomach?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Both.&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;It hurts doesn&#39;t it?&quot;  <br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;  <br/>\nRecently I asked Clare if I could tell this story in a talk I  was giving. <br/>\nShe said sure but she didn&#39;t remember the incident. To Clare, it was  not a <br/>\nmemorable event. That&#39;s exactly the way it should have been. Had I  unleashed any <br/>\nof those lines teachers are famous for like &quot;How could you have  made that <br/>\nsame stupid mistake all week long? Do you ever look at the notes?,&quot; I  think <br/>\nshe&#39;d have remembered. She was already embarrassed by her mistake and her  <br/>\nassumption of correctness. What I did was to &quot;hold her hand&quot; while she got in  touch <br/>\nwith how really rotten it did feel, right into her chest and stomach. With  <br/>\nboth of us accepting all these feelings she could then let go of them and we  <br/>\ncould move on.  <br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve learned from my adult students is how much our  education hurts, <br/>\nhow much we all suffered to get where we are, and how much  teachers&#39; <br/>\nremembrance of their own history makes them repeat it rather than  correct it. What I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned is how rare is the consideration of students&#39;  feelings, not <br/>\nwithstanding some wonderful exceptions.  <br/>\nMost of all, I&#39;ve learned the value of compassion in education,  allowing the <br/>\nstudents the space to learn and know all the diverse emotions  involved in <br/>\nlearning. It&#39;s not dramatic; it&#39;s just kind. It doesn&#39;t call  attention to <br/>\nitself; it does no harm. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2849,"nextTopicId":2877}}
