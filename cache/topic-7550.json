I know with my DH, there have <br/>\nbeen times when what he said, how he said it, were clearly voices <br/>\nfrom the past coming out his mouth (because I&#39;ve heard the same <br/>\nwords and tone used in his parents&#39; home). For instance, one evening <br/>\nwhen we were dating (lo these many years ago), I had dinner with his <br/>\nfamily (not an uncommon event by any means - I knew MIL before DH <br/>\nand I even met!). His littlest sister (about 7 or 8 at the time - <br/>\nthere&#39;s a good 17 years or so age difference between oldest and <br/>\nyoungest in his family) did something, dropped something or <br/>\nwhatever, and DH used one of those &quot;what are you, stupid?&quot; type <br/>\nphrases in anger and frustration. After dinner, when we were alone <br/>\ngoing to a movie or something, I played the scene back at him. He <br/>\n*didn&#39;t even realize what he said*. It was something he had heard <br/>\nall his life, sometimes directed at him, so it didn&#39;t occur to him <br/>\nto do anything different. I told him flat out I didn&#39;t want to hear <br/>\nit again and that it would not be coming to our house. He&#39;s grown <br/>\nway more sensitive to that sort of stuff and has rooted out a lot of <br/>\nthose old tapes over time.

Our son is not yet 18 months old... so <br/>\nI&#39;m sure he&#39;d find it unfair for me to treat him the same way as the <br/>\nbaby... but then again, that&#39;s the whole point... he just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nquite get it.  And after further discussion, we&#39;ve come to the <br/>\nrealization that we&#39;d actually do the same thing in handling the baby <br/>\ndropping food, he just phrases it in a way that makes it sound very <br/>\ncontrolling.  (We ask him if he&#39;d pick it up or hand it to us -- <br/>\nsomething he loves to do -- and if he refuses clean it up ourselves.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I recently reached an epiphany where I realized that the <br/>\nwhole &quot;trying to say &#39;yes&#39; whenever possible, getting to the root of <br/>\nthe desire when &#39;yes&#39; isn&#39;t possible, and validating the feelings if <br/>\nnothing else&quot; applies equally to husbands.  I don&#39;t think either of <br/>\nus had a real good working definition of &quot;respect.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m going to try this way of relating to him (without telling him, <br/>\nof course) and see if in a few months he notices the difference.  My <br/>\nhope is it will improve our relationship as well as give him an idea <br/>\nof what I want for our relationship with our son.  I expect this to <br/>\nbe one of the hardest things I&#39;ve attempted in my life, and I try to <br/>\nthink of him as a teenager who&#39;s trying to &quot;get my goat&quot; (is that the <br/>\nphrase?) in the best possible way I can.  So far I&#39;ve been only <br/>\nmoderately successful, but maybe that&#39;s the best way for me to <br/>\n&quot;transition&quot; into this as opposed to a sudden drastic change (which <br/>\ncould have a negative backlash).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, I&#39;m going to do my best to get my hands on Rue&#39;s book (for <br/>\nme as well as for him) as soon as I can scrape the money together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 9 Nov 2005 at 20:46, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Andrea L.
