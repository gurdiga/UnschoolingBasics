This is my first time posting. I&#39;ve been lurking for quite a<br/>\nwhile, but I really wanted to comment on this. My daughter is almost<br/>\n4, and last summer, she wanted to run everywhere. I am not a runner,<br/>\nand we have another child who was only six months old last summer, so<br/>\nwe devised a game. We&#39;d say go and she gets to run until we say stop.<br/>\nThen she stops and waits for us to say go again. She loved it! We<br/>\nstill do it. That way she gets to run, and we keep her out of the<br/>\nstreets. She learned very quickly to wait for an adult and watch for<br/>\ncars. For the past half year, we even let her walk through parking<br/>\nlots and across streets without holding hands. We taught her the<br/>\nsafety rules, and trust her to follow them.<br/>\nAs far as bedtime goes, we let her decide when to go to bed. She&#39;s<br/>\nfrequently up late watching movies (gets it from me, I&#39;m a night owl,<br/>\ntoo.) When she&#39;s ready to go to sleep, she turns off the movie and the<br/>\nlights and goes to sleep. Sometimes I&#39;m still up, sometimes I&#39;m<br/>\nalready in bed. She gets ready for bed when the rest of us do, but<br/>\nthen she stays up until she&#39;s ready to sleep.

(most times the prescription is written to appease <br/>\na nervous parent, not because the situation requires it - most kid <br/>\nillnesses run their course in a week with or without antibiotics - <br/>\nand the antibiotics just cause the &#39;bugs&#39; to get resistant). When DS <br/>\nwas a toddler, I still used the infant syringe - bypassed the taste <br/>\nbuds almost totally. Now, he&#39;s 8 and any medication is served with a <br/>\nglass of water as a chaser. One biggie, though, is that by and <br/>\nlarge, he has a say in when he needs a doctor, when he needs OTC <br/>\nmeds for his comfort (for example, something to soothe a sore <br/>\nthroat), and so on. Since he has a history of choice in this, when I <br/>\nsay &quot;I think you really need to ...&quot;, he takes it pretty seriously <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t do that all the time.

I know that some  <br/>\nmama&#39;s feel attacked and leave when things get discussed, and at that  <br/>\npoint everyone loses out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am most interested in what you yourself say about the situation &quot;I  <br/>\ndo find situations where *I feel I need* to make the decision for  <br/>\nthem, or otherwise I hear myself nagging them&quot; I hear that you still  <br/>\nhave a lot of fear, and basically distrust in the common sense of  <br/>\ntoddlers. I understand completely, I felt that way when my oldest was  <br/>\nyoung. I&#39;m so thankful for my big family, because it forces me to let  <br/>\ngo of some issues I used to hold dear. When those things slide, I see  <br/>\nthat it wasn&#39;t as life-threatening as I thought it was. Sam and Dan  <br/>\nstarted climbing on the monkey bars when they were 18 months old. The  <br/>\nother moms at the park would gasp, sigh, keep eagle eyes on them,  <br/>\nbasically ruining their fun and my fun watching them. When I trusted  <br/>\nthem, they did as much as they were capable of doing. They had no  <br/>\noverwhelming desire to &quot;prove&quot; themselves and go beyond their  <br/>\ncapabilities. They could stop and ask for help. They could choose to  <br/>\nfigure it out for themselves. It was scary for me at first, but how  <br/>\nempowering for them for me to stand by, be amazed, and let them see  <br/>\nwhat their limits were.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the quote above, I hear you say &#39;if my kids don&#39;t make the choice  <br/>\nI want for them, I will continue to nag them until they do or until I  <br/>\nfinally put my foot down and make them do what I want&#39;. There is no  <br/>\nempowerment for a child who knows that unless his choice matches up  <br/>\nwith his mother&#39;s he has no free will. KWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\nCase by case, chicken nuggets usually come cooked, here in Oklahoma  <br/>\nthere is one brand that is not precooked. If yours don&#39;t, why are  <br/>\nthey sitting out on the cabinet where he sees them? Could you just  <br/>\nput them directly into the oven from the freezer? Could you microwave  <br/>\nthem? Let him try one, and see if he honestly likes it frozen? The  <br/>\ntexture and hardness of frozen chicken is completely different that  <br/>\nfrozen potatoes or waffles.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn medication, are there alternatives? A single shot instead of a  <br/>\nweek of disgusting syrup? Maybe they&#39;d be willing to take pills? Is  <br/>\nit an infection that you could wait and see if it heals on its own?  <br/>\nMost do....within a time frame similar to that on antibiotics. We  <br/>\nhave not given antibiotics for ear infections since Bre was  a year  <br/>\nold. At that time, she had three months of ear infections, dozens of  <br/>\nbottles of pink amoxycillan, and it never would go away. I drew the  <br/>\nline when the ped said, well, her whole system is messed up from all  <br/>\nthose antibiotics, we&#39;ll need to put her on probiotics, then onto  <br/>\nanother version of the antibiotics. I took her off everything, and  <br/>\nwithin a week she was infection free for the first time in months. We  <br/>\nfound a pediatrician who was groundbreaking on the whole ear  <br/>\ninfection thing, and we&#39;ve never looked back. He&#39;s against  <br/>\nantibiotics in most cases, and so when he does suggest something he&#39;s  <br/>\nvery serious. He&#39;s never once told us we needed it for any of the  <br/>\nkids colds or infections. He&#39;s always said lets give it four or five  <br/>\ndays and see what it&#39;s looking like.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning on uneven concrete is a scary one, granted. But how do you  <br/>\nknow he can&#39;t do it? How will HE ever know it&#39;s dangerous? My two  <br/>\nboys can run like mountain goats over almost any kind of surface,  <br/>\nit&#39;s amazing, and Breanna can balance on the backs of folding chairs  <br/>\nand run across those (I know that&#39;s weird). The worst that would  <br/>\nhappen is what? He&#39;d fall, split his head open and die? Is that  <br/>\nreally something that concerns, or is it the more usual damage done  <br/>\nby scrapping knees and bloodying a lip? Not lifelong damage, a  <br/>\nlearning moment, and perhaps the one time he needs to fall to know  <br/>\nforever HOW to run on uneven cement. Dan fell Friday at the park on  <br/>\nthe climbing rocks. He busted his upper lip all the way across, and  <br/>\nscrapped some skin back from one of his teeth. I was able to pick him  <br/>\nup, look at it, commiserate. He decided that from now on, those rocks  <br/>\nwere NOT safe to play on. At two he very carefully climbed back up,  <br/>\nheld up a stop sign for some kids we didn&#39;t know, and lisped &quot;Those  <br/>\nrocks are very tricky, if you climb be very very careful!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThese things are so overrated. Brushing your teeth doesn&#39;t HAVE to  <br/>\nhappen three times a day right after meals. Some of my kids like to  <br/>\nbrush before breakfast, some not til after. Some wait until it&#39;s  <br/>\nnearly lunch. Some do it after lunch, some while watching TV, some  <br/>\nwhile reading, some brush in the bathtub while pretending to be  <br/>\nmermaids. Sometimes they don&#39;t want to brush all day. I might ask  <br/>\nthem if they had, if they need help.

I have been doing that since about when he turned 3. I also go to bed and I tell him if he needs me to come get me or come to bed when he is tired. It has never been a problem. I think he was about 2 and half when I could leave him downstairs byhimself. I did use a monitor just as a safety tool so I could hear him back then. He alsways did great and came to bed when he was ready. NowadayI go up somedays and he comes when he is ready. Sometimes he does it by himself and sometimes I remiind him to brush and pee but that is getting more rare. Sometimes I already have the baby down and I come to the computer and he will come get me and tell me that he needs to go to bed. We co-seelp and I still nurse him a few seconds before he turns to seelp so I go up with him and we sleep. He also has told me he did not want to brush sometimes and that is ok.

My son prefers his food<br/>\nfrozen and unheated. I do give him waffles and French fries this way.  His<br/>\nchicken nuggets look the same to him frozen and cooked, so he becomes upset<br/>\neach time I refuse to give him these to eat directly from the freezer. I<br/>\nhave tried to explain the difference to him, but it&#39;s hard for him to get<br/>\npast his initial frustration at being told that I can&#39;t give it to him raw.<br/>\nI suppose I could cook a few and then refreeze them for him.  I have felt a<br/>\nneed to force my children (toddlers) to take un-tasty medication<br/>\n(antibiotics) after attempts to make it seem more palatable failed, and<br/>\nattempts to explain its purpose didn&#39;t impress them enough to make them take<br/>\nit willingly.  I hated doing this.  The running into the street example was<br/>\nmade up, but I do worry all the time when my son runs on uneven concrete (on<br/>\nour way to the park, where there is more grass).  It really is hard for him<br/>\nto delay the running until we get to the park, especially because he is so<br/>\nexcited to get there. <br/>\n<br/>\n     No matter how much I try to empower/recognize my preschool age children<br/>\nas a general rule, I do find situations where I feel I need to make the<br/>\ndecision for them, or otherwise, I hear myself nagging them.  This strikes<br/>\nme as a little hypocritical and I worry that they&#39;re sure to catch on that<br/>\nsometimes what they would have themselves do can get overruled by me.  And<br/>\nthe nagging makes me feel stupid.  I am aware that this points to a family<br/>\nhierarchy which I wish I could balance a little more in their favors.  I<br/>\nfind myself trying to represent natural consequences for them so that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to split their skulls or get sick to learn from their mistakes<br/>\n(They&#39;re still so young).  Of course this makes me the bad guy, and sets me<br/>\nup as the enemy. I admit that in my previous post (in addition to attempting<br/>\nto hybrid examples to avoid being verbose (like I am now)) I tried to<br/>\nrepresent a range of examples in search of some kind of theoretical<br/>\nunschooling maxim or strategy that I might apply in more than a few<br/>\nsituations like this that seem to come up.  I liked the responses suggesting<br/>\nthat I hug and redirect the baby, and the suggestion to control the<br/>\nenvironment rather than the child.   I do feel responsible for their safety<br/>\nat this point in time.  I suppose if I had a little more time (I have a new<br/>\ninfant at home, the third baby) I could come up with a creative solution for<br/>\neach case.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with the tooth brushing, for example, probably happens when my<br/>\nson feels he is being interrupted in some play or project, in spite of my<br/>\ntrying to give him some notice and then suggest him into the bathroom as the<br/>\nfamily prepares to shut the house down and go to sleep.  I don&#39;t feel I can<br/>\nlet him stay awake alone for safety reasons and I do think the tooth<br/>\nbrushing is important.  As he needs help brushing his teeth, I try to fit<br/>\nhim into a slot for it as I juggle the needs of my other children at that<br/>\ntime of day too.  We probably need to redevelop our bedtime routine to make<br/>\nit more positive for everyone now that the infant also requires my<br/>\nassistance.   This example, I think, also brings up the question of<br/>\nconvenience, and the legitimacy of expecting the children to adjust to my<br/>\nneeds, or the needs of each other, as I often adjust to theirs.  I would<br/>\nappreciate comments on how children would learn to do this voluntarily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also appreciate comments on whether and to what extent you believe<br/>\nthat the application of unschooling principles differs or remains constant<br/>\ndepending on the age of the children. I find this a hard question because<br/>\nthere is obviously no cut and dry line or &quot;age of reason&quot; for children, and<br/>\nthey grow at their own paces in so many different ways.  My parents always<br/>\ntold me that I would earn the right to make my own decisions by first making<br/>\ngood decisions and I always hated that.  I would like to encourage my<br/>\nchildren to feel autonomous, yet interdependent on family, as young as<br/>\npossible.  I&#39;m having trouble seeing how to strike this balance and create<br/>\nthis understanding.  It seems to me that whatever I can say about toddlers<br/>\nto try and cite &quot;special circumstances&quot; (such as the children&#39;s own<br/>\ninexperience, safety reasons, or convenience) as a justification for &quot;having<br/>\nthe final say&quot;. that it would be easy to make similar arguments with older<br/>\nchildren in cases where I feel myself to be more experienced.  Where would<br/>\nit end?... it probably would not be unschooling.  Yet my questions still<br/>\nremain.

I have a hypothetical question intending to <br/>\nelicit suggestions on parenting a toddler with compassion based on <br/>\nunschooling principles.  How can I dampen frustration for my two and <br/>\na half year old son, (or for myself), and effectively guide him in <br/>\nsituations where (for example) his own instincts (at the moment) <br/>\nwould lead him to run on a wet marble floor, prefer his chicken <br/>\nuncooked, leave his teeth unbrushed, or (again hypothetically) say, <br/>\nrefuse a needed medication, or run into the street. I&#39;m sure you can <br/>\nimagine a number more examples varying in level of urgency.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nnormally ascribe to the &quot;irrational child&quot; designation as I have <br/>\nfound my children to be very responsive to reason and capable of <br/>\nmaking intelligent choices. There are times, however, where either I <br/>\nam tied up and unable to stop and guide my children in this way in <br/>\ntime, or where they (like sometimes I) have a hard few moments, or <br/>\nwhere they just seem to lack some necessary bit of background <br/>\ninformation (i.e. re: salmonella poisoning).  In some cases there <br/>\nseems to be a rather immediate safety or health issue; in others a <br/>\nless immmediate one like in the case of toothbrushing.  How can I <br/>\nbalance protecting my child with my wish to allow him to flourish as <br/>\nan empowered decision maker, and what method of &quot;pulling rank&quot; (if <br/>\nyou would) would you consider the least damaging or disrespectful? I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t notice a way to access archives on this list and hope my <br/>\nquestion is not redundant.
