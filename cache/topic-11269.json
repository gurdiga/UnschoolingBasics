I<br/>\n&gt; was thankful that <br/>\n&gt; my husband had something to hold on to while we got<br/>\n&gt; through the <br/>\n&gt; early stages of deschooling ourselves.  I also<br/>\n&gt; agreed with him that <br/>\n&gt; with traveling we could expose our kids to so much<br/>\n&gt; more now that we <br/>\n&gt; were outside the `school box&#39;.   Well, as time<br/>\n&gt; passed we got <br/>\n&gt; ourselves more and more out of that box, but not in<br/>\n&gt; a physical way <br/>\n&gt; as we had anticipated.  As we delved deeper into<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, then <br/>\n&gt; into radical unschooling, the process took us on a<br/>\n&gt; journey richer <br/>\n&gt; and deeper than we ever could have imagined.  With<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, the <br/>\n&gt; joy has not come from our freedom with open<br/>\n&gt; schedules or traveling <br/>\n&gt; abroad as much as it has come from getting to know<br/>\n&gt; ourselves on a <br/>\n&gt; deeper level and delighting in doing things in each<br/>\n&gt; other&#39;s company.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes people ask what we do when we unschool. <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s a tough one <br/>\n&gt; to answer of course, because any one thing that I<br/>\n&gt; may mention looks <br/>\n&gt; horribly mundane to most people.   It&#39;s not the<br/>\n&gt; things that we do <br/>\n&gt; exactly, but the way that we experience them.  The<br/>\n&gt; thoughtfulness, <br/>\n&gt; excitement, joy, delight, and yes, sometimes even<br/>\n&gt; sadness is what <br/>\n&gt; makes the things worthwhile.  Awhile back, I started<br/>\n&gt; a `My Favorite <br/>\n&gt; Things&#39; list (I know, I knowÂ…you just can&#39;t help<br/>\n&gt; hearing Julie <br/>\n&gt; Andrews&#39; voice in your head when you read that).  My<br/>\n&gt; list is just <br/>\n&gt; another list that I felt compelled to write one day,<br/>\n&gt; but I think <br/>\n&gt; that it is also a good way of answering the<br/>\n&gt; question, &quot;What do you <br/>\n&gt; do when you unschool?&quot;  Well, this list is the rich<br/>\n&gt; and immensely <br/>\n&gt; gratifying everyday things that unschooling has<br/>\n&gt; brought our way.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My Favorite Things<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Holding my kids hands while we walk and feeling<br/>\n&gt; their tiny fingers <br/>\n&gt; and slightly sweaty palms.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sitting in the coffee or doughnut shop brainstorming<br/>\n&gt; with my kids, <br/>\n&gt; telling stories and doing `doughnut shop&#39; math for<br/>\n&gt; the pure delight <br/>\n&gt; of it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Drinking my tea in the morning while feeling the<br/>\n&gt; warm sun and slight <br/>\n&gt; breeze from an open window.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Being woken up in the middle of the night by my son<br/>\n&gt; telling me that <br/>\n&gt; he has finished his very first book.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Watching my daughter walk on tip-toe.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Smelling my kids&#39; spicy bodies after they have been<br/>\n&gt; out playing.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Listening to my daughter act out one of her stories<br/>\n&gt; with one of her <br/>\n&gt; little stuffed animals.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Making homemade gravestones (complete with names and<br/>\n&gt; epitaphs) for <br/>\n&gt; two birds that passed away in our yard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Listening to my son in a craft store as he excitedly<br/>\n&gt; rattles off his <br/>\n&gt; ideas in a voice slightly too loud and observing<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s smiles <br/>\n&gt; around us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Getting spontaneously hugged, ever so tightly, by<br/>\n&gt; both my son and <br/>\n&gt; daughter at the same time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pretending we don&#39;t see the kids when they are<br/>\n&gt; sneaking around <br/>\n&gt; spying on my husband and I.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yelling, &quot;We love unschooling!&quot; at the top of our<br/>\n&gt; lungs when our joy <br/>\n&gt; can no longer be contained.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -Dana<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

Tonight<br/>\nI made a very difficult decision to resign as a writer for a Disney<br/>\nnewsletter that I have been a part of since its inception.  I loved what I<br/>\ndid, but recently it has had some changes that made me feel unimportant.<br/>\nThe final straw came when the owner (who has had NO editorial comment since<br/>\nit began) decided that we should run an article that was hotly debated.  It<br/>\nwas an article about child safety while attending Disney parks and advocated<br/>\nthe use of leashes.  I felt it was too touchy of a subject and that we<br/>\nshould exclude that part and that the void of it would be less controversial<br/>\nthan the inclusion.  The owner decided that we should run it with the<br/>\ninclusion as it is a good way to inform parents who might not know about<br/>\nleashes.  :(  (IOW she used it with her kids and thought it was great and so<br/>\neveryone should use them - she has stated this before &quot;If every parent would<br/>\nput their preschoolers on leashes then they would always know where their<br/>\nchildren are!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was feeling very down about losing this aspect of my life.  I love<br/>\nwriting (as you can all tell from my very lengthy posts LOL!) and love<br/>\nDisney (we call our Disney trips our &quot;Best Ever Field Trip.&quot;)  So putting<br/>\nwriting together with Disney was just the icing on the cake!  I&#39;m still<br/>\nfeeling a void as there is an approaching deadline and I feel like I am<br/>\nsupposed to be doing something.

I also agreed with him that <br/>\nwith traveling we could expose our kids to so much more now that we <br/>\nwere outside the `school box&#39;.   Well, as time passed we got <br/>\nourselves more and more out of that box, but not in a physical way <br/>\nas we had anticipated.  As we delved deeper into unschooling, then <br/>\ninto radical unschooling, the process took us on a journey richer <br/>\nand deeper than we ever could have imagined.  With unschooling, the <br/>\njoy has not come from our freedom with open schedules or traveling <br/>\nabroad as much as it has come from getting to know ourselves on a <br/>\ndeeper level and delighting in doing things in each other&#39;s company.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people ask what we do when we unschool.  It&#39;s a tough one <br/>\nto answer of course, because any one thing that I may mention looks <br/>\nhorribly mundane to most people.   It&#39;s not the things that we do <br/>\nexactly, but the way that we experience them.  The thoughtfulness, <br/>\nexcitement, joy, delight, and yes, sometimes even sadness is what <br/>\nmakes the things worthwhile.  Awhile back, I started a `My Favorite <br/>\nThings&#39; list (I know, I knowÂ…you just can&#39;t help hearing Julie <br/>\nAndrews&#39; voice in your head when you read that).  My list is just <br/>\nanother list that I felt compelled to write one day, but I think <br/>\nthat it is also a good way of answering the question, &quot;What do you <br/>\ndo when you unschool?&quot;  Well, this list is the rich and immensely <br/>\ngratifying everyday things that unschooling has brought our way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Favorite Things<br/>\n<br/>\nHolding my kids hands while we walk and feeling their tiny fingers <br/>\nand slightly sweaty palms.<br/>\n<br/>\nSitting in the coffee or doughnut shop brainstorming with my kids, <br/>\ntelling stories and doing `doughnut shop&#39; math for the pure delight <br/>\nof it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrinking my tea in the morning while feeling the warm sun and slight <br/>\nbreeze from an open window.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing woken up in the middle of the night by my son telling me that <br/>\nhe has finished his very first book.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching my daughter walk on tip-toe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmelling my kids&#39; spicy bodies after they have been out playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nListening to my daughter act out one of her stories with one of her <br/>\nlittle stuffed animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking homemade gravestones (complete with names and epitaphs) for <br/>\ntwo birds that passed away in our yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nListening to my son in a craft store as he excitedly rattles off his <br/>\nideas in a voice slightly too loud and observing people&#39;s smiles <br/>\naround us.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting spontaneously hugged, ever so tightly, by both my son and <br/>\ndaughter at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretending we don&#39;t see the kids when they are sneaking around <br/>\nspying on my husband and I.<br/>\n<br/>\nYelling, &quot;We love unschooling!&quot; at the top of our lungs when our joy <br/>\ncan no longer be contained.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11273,"nextTopicId":11279}}
