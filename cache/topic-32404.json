For unschooling kids, unschooling is a life style, not an  <br/>\ninterest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame goes with ages. Age is not an interest ;-) Just because kids are  <br/>\nbetween 6 and 12 doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll have anything in common.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kids want, just as adults want, are to find people with  <br/>\ncompatible personalities and similar interests. (Too simplified but a  <br/>\ngood starting point for people trying to find friends for their kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I saw my eleven year-old<br/>\n&gt; niece&#39;s MySpace page and I almost had a stroke!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Is her MySpace page stroke worthy because she&#39;s unmonitored, because  <br/>\nshe&#39;s 11 or because she&#39;s in school and disconnected from her family?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an important question! One that often isn&#39;t asked because almost  <br/>\nall kids go to school with their lives controlled by school and  <br/>\nparents. So there isn&#39;t a way to separate the effects of school (and  <br/>\ntraditional parenting) from the effects of being 11.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschoolers know. :-) We can see why traditionally parented,  <br/>\nschooled kids hide things, why those kids pretend to be something  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t to attract &quot;friends&quot;. Take away the distrust, take away  <br/>\nthe pressure to do what they don&#39;t believe in, take away the severing  <br/>\nof family ties while they&#39;re still dependent, add in trust that  <br/>\nthey&#39;re good people, add in support for their interests and who they  <br/>\nare, add in close family ties and it&#39;s amazing the behavior that&#39;s  <br/>\nconsidered normal for kids really isn&#39;t. So much is caused by  <br/>\ndistrust, control and disconnection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What would you like<br/>\n&gt; to see in a kids or tweens social networking site (besides it being<br/>\n&gt; heavilyï¿½HEAVILY  Monitored!)?

Parents are saying &quot;I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t trust the world.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat kids *feel* is &quot;I don&#39;t trust you.&quot; Kids will react to the  <br/>\nreality they perceive not to the one we intend. So it makes no  <br/>\ndifference how good our intentions are, makes no difference what we  <br/>\ntell them our intentions are, if the actions feel like distrust and  <br/>\ncontrol, kids will react like we&#39;re intentionally distrusting and  <br/>\ncontrolling them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are controlled (by distrust in this case) learn to hide  <br/>\nthings they know their parents would disapprove of. We can&#39;t help  <br/>\nthem and advise them and pass on useful information for situations if  <br/>\nkids are hiding things. And if we treat them in ways that will cause  <br/>\nthem to hide things, then we&#39;re getting in the way of our own goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean we throw our hands up in the air! Just because the  <br/>\nfamiliar tools of keeping kids safe aren&#39;t as good as we thought,  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t *other* tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe trust *them*. We trust that they want to be good people, that they  <br/>\nwant to be safe. They don&#39;t always know how but we trust that they  <br/>\nhave instincts and that when they feel something is wrong -- *and*  <br/>\nwe&#39;ve shown that we&#39;re trustworthy to *help* them -- they&#39;ll come to  <br/>\nus for advice.

The town had a one<br/>\nweek soccer camp program, 2 hrs per day, that looked like a good fit. DS<br/>\nLOVED IT! The next year, he made sure I signed him up as soon as<br/>\npossible for the camp. However, the age bracket was different - 7 yr<br/>\nolds were grouped with the 8-9 yr olds (the 6 yr olds were with the 4<br/>\nand 5s). And, they went for 3 hours instead of two. Plus, rather than it<br/>\nbeing mostly short fun ball-related games (with lots of breaks and jokes<br/>\nand silly stuff), it was heavier on skill drills and actual &#39;soccer&#39;<br/>\npractice. DS tried it for a day and decided he really didn&#39;t like it. We<br/>\nasked that he go back for the next day to see if it changed (first days<br/>\ncan sometimes be rather stressful in general, getting organized and<br/>\nall). He decided that day that he didn&#39;t like the organized stuff BUT he<br/>\nhit it off with another kid who also didn&#39;t want to do the drill stuff.<br/>\nSo, the two of them would meet up each morning and take their soccer<br/>\nballs (each participant got their own ball as part of the program) and<br/>\ngo find a spot off to the side to run and play. He liked doing that and<br/>\ngladly got up each morning to go play with a new friend. [parenthetical<br/>\nnote: that second year, we were asked to house one of the coaches - the<br/>\n&#39;import&#39; coaches from the UK and they travel around the US all summer<br/>\nrunning these camps. We got the cost of the program refunded for<br/>\nproviding a bed, shower, and some meals - plus we got a chance to meet<br/>\nsomeone from Wales!] The following year he was uninterested so we didn&#39;t<br/>\nsign up. Last summer, we signed up for a beginning golf lesson program,<br/>\nonce per week for 4 weeks. He loved it! It was maybe 5-15 minutes of<br/>\ninstruction on the various clubs (how to hold a driver, lining up the<br/>\nball, swing and follow through, etc) with the other 45 minutes of the<br/>\nclass time on the driving range hitting golfballs while the instructor<br/>\nwalked around providing tips and encouragement.

So, I would say taking <br/>\na child out like that would help a ton. He had alot of issues (ADHD, <br/>\nBi-polar, family problems, and more). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son would easily be an ADHD label too. You should see him at <br/>\nsoccer. He doesn&#39;t want to play soccer for 1 hour and I don&#39;t blame <br/>\nhim. The coach is very nice and since he is just shy of 4, no one <br/>\nexpects much more. Right now he would rather run around like an <br/>\nairplane, sit with me, etc. At this age no one minds much but I see <br/>\npossible problems in the future.

I have never forced any of them on him.
