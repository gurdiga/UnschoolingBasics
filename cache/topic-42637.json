That&#39;s part of the Why behind challenging all your automatic &quot;nos&quot; and figuring out which ones to modify or discard. When you say &quot;no&quot; too much, present too much fear as fact, you lose credibility and your authority is a matter of age and strength, not experience and perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense? Its possible to Choose to listen to authority, but part of that choice involves being able to critically asses that authority and see if there&#39;s anything worth listening to in the first place. The authority of an unschooling parent comes from being trustworthy from the perspective of the individual child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;When we &#39;research&#39; about food choices <br/>\n&gt; (since thats whats being talked about right now on this list), aren&#39;t we <br/>\n&gt; looking to authority?  Food scientists?  Activists? Researchers?  <br/>\n&gt; Ancient people&#39;s diets?  Those are authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you decide Which is the proper authority, though? Raw food or ayerveda? Macrobiotic or scientifically balanced nutrients? What adults do is find one that seems trustworthy, based on personal criteria, and try it out. If the results aren&#39;t great, though, most adults move on to something else, reassess those &quot;trustworthy sources&quot; from the point of view of their failure. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids do the same with you. If your information doesn&#39;t line up with their experience, they&#39;re less inclined to trust other information. That&#39;s part of why your dd will eat things you say make her itchy - she&#39;s making sure she can trust your so-called facts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdults are full of so-called facts that seem ludicrous to children. The earth goes around the sun, what poppycock. Tadpoles turn into frogs? You&#39;re crazy mom. Corn grows on a plant? You&#39;re kidding me. Because Mo has seen tadpoles in stages of development in real life, she&#39;s come to accept I&#39;m not so crazy about that one. Because she got to grow some corn of her own, she&#39;s willing to accept my facts. Maybe the earth really does go around the sun... she was right about the frogs and the corn. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it not valuable for a person to feel the authority of the Law, when <br/>\n&gt; they are considering whether to commit a crime?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I honestly don&#39;t know a single person who has committed a crime and considered authority as more than a possible inconvenience, something to work around. That&#39;s not the kind of relationship I want with my kids - I don&#39;t want to be the &quot;authority&quot; they lie to, hide from, and twart. I&#39;d rather be the one they can bounce ideas off and know that, while I&#39;m not always right, I don&#39;t try to sell my fears as facts, my insecurities as The One True Way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is there no value in the &#39;moral&#39; authority of a person&#39;s religious <br/>\n&gt; beliefs?

Some very strongly religious people put a high moral value on thinking for themselves! even when it flies in the face of &quot;authorities&quot; in their own denomination or sect.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: To deepen my understanding of the unschooling we are doing","postDate":"1262496362","msgId":42743,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNThCREY3MjNCODQyMUFBNjE2RDAxRTk5Nzc2MTJDQENvbm5pZVBDPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCNDAxRDRGLjQwNEB5YWhvby5jYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDRCNDAxRDRGLjQwNEB5YWhvby5jYT4="},"prevInTopic":42739,"nextInTopic":42756,"prevInTime":42742,"nextInTime":42744,"topicId":42637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... when we have a choice to make?

I want my kids (and myself) to be comfortable going to an authority without taking what they say as the only truth. I want my kids to be able to know when to go to an authority and when to reject and question authority. There is value in looking to outside authority but you need to be able to know whether you want to listen to that authority or not. Let&#39;s face it, I can pretty much pick any idea and then go find an authority to back up that idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Is it not valuable for a person to feel the authority of the Law, when <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they are considering whether to commit a crime?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, it is good to know the law and give it consideration but you also need to be able to know whether or not there is something that you are willing to commit a crime for. I have seen activists and protesters break laws in order to further their agenda. I want my children to be able to judge individual circumstances rather than hypothetical situations. Committing a crime can include something as small as littering or something as big as murder. You can&#39;t paint those two things with the same brush. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there no value in the &#39;moral&#39; authority of a person&#39;s religious <br/>\n </span></blockquote>beliefs? If I person believed in a religion, would they not be thinking <br/>\nfor themselves? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is nothing wrong with following a religion. Unschooling does not rule out any set of beliefs. Ultimately, you decide to be a part of a religion or adhere to a certain belief system. From my perspective, if you are raising your children to a certain belief system, then you would also explain your beliefs to them and answer questions about other belief systems in an open and honest fashion. My husband is Catholic and was a Benedictine Monk when he was younger. He has his belief system and I have mine. If the kids want to go with him, they can. If they choose not to, that is fine too. If they ask questions about our differing belief systems, we answer them to the best of our ability. My husband doesn&#39;t expect me to be Catholic any more than I expect him to reject his Catholicism.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In my mind, I think I&#39;ve been painting the idea of sending my children <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to school as an &#39;evil&#39; &#39;bad mommy&#39; kind of thing, and unschooling as the <br/>\npolar opposite, the thing to do if I&#39;m really going to be a &#39;great&#39; mommy. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe education method you choose does not make you a great mommy. I am sure there are a lot of really great moms that send their kids to public school and that there are a lot of unschooling moms that are not so great. I try not to set myself up as a great mommy because there are days that I completely suck at this parenting thing. I think the big difference is that unschoolers step down from their pedestals and walk along side their children and are willing to admit that they don&#39;t have all of the answers. Embracing unschooling was a very humbling experience for me because it meant that I let go of the notion that I always knew what was best for my children. It also meant that I had to let go of a lot of fears. One of those fears was about whether or not I was a good parent. I try to be the best parent that I can be at any given moment. That means that I am probably going to make a lot of mistakes. That is okay though because I have not set myself as the ultimate authority on anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: To deepen my understanding of the unschooling we are doing","postDate":"1262493007","msgId":42739,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNDAxRDRGLjQwNEB5YWhvby5jYT4="},"prevInTopic":42737,"nextInTopic":42743,"prevInTime":42738,"nextInTime":42740,"topicId":42637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**My thoughts on outcome here are that w/unschooling they will retain their inherent curiosity/love of learning, and be able to think for themselves, rather","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1418262494\">**My thoughts on outcome here are that w/unschooling they will retain <br/>\ntheir inherent curiosity/love of learning, and be able to think for <br/>\nthemselves, rather than look to some outside authority when they have <br/>\nchoice to make.**<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I like to question things.

Unschooling kids do all sorts of &quot;bad&quot; things. They are just like all of the other kids. The major difference is that unschooling parents typically have a positive view of human nature and kids. I think it is Alfie Kohn that says where we start makes a big difference. If we start at a place that assumes kids are bad and lazy and need someone to tell them what to do all the time, then that is going to look a lot different than someone that believes kids are basically good people that just need guidance and support along the way. Unschooling does not produce kids that don&#39;t do anything wrong. Unschooling produces kids that are capable of thinking about the world on their own terms using their own language. A lot of stuff that the &quot;traditional&quot; kids do is a result of trying to gain some kind of control over their own lives. They live in a reactionary state. Everything is a reaction rather than just an action. I want my kids to live an action filled life rather than a reaction filled life. (It makes sense in my head.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I kind of thought, well, you <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t limit the food, so they gain a healthy perspective, listen to <br/>\ntheir bodies, etc... so then my conclusion was that unschooled kids <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t ever be overweight, because that wouldn&#39;t be balance learned <br/>\nthrough listening to their bodies. But I&#39;m wrong, right?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is not going to produce kids that aren&#39;t overweight. It is going to produce kids that set their own priorities rather than having all of them set for them. If an unschooling kid is overweight, they will be able to decide whether or not they want to go on a diet or change their eating habits. They won&#39;t have external forces trying to force them into conforming. Unschooling isn&#39;t going to eliminate any unbalance. It is going to enable kids to notice when they feel out of balance rather than relying on the rest of the world to tell them when they are out of balance. It is really difficult to make choices when external forces are drowning out your own intuition. Sometimes a little imbalance is good because that is when we learn the most. When I have been out of balance, it is easiest to get back in balance when I don&#39;t have other people trying to dictate what they think I should be doing. I want my kids to be able to drown out the unhelpful voices and find their own balance. In other words, I want them to have a finely tuned BS detector. Tuning your BS detector sometimes means that you have to wade through some of it and get a little dirty. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our teenagers will make mistakes, they might do something <br/>\n </span></blockquote>illegal, or drink too much, or get arrested for something, just like <br/>\nother teenagers.

They may or may not want to talk to us about it. The difference is that if they don&#39;t want to talk about it, we won&#39;t take it personal. There is a good chance that they will know what they are doing is wrong or illegal but will have chosen to do so anyway. The reason that I have chosen unschooling is not to have teens that are easier or kids that don&#39;t do bad stuff. All kids will do something wrong at one time or another. My goal is to have children that are capable of thinking for themselves. I want them to be able to set their own agendas and be comfortable with it. I want to parent from a place of peace rather than from a place of fear. I don&#39;t want to pass all of my fears and weirdness and baggage on to my children. My parents did that to me and it doesn&#39;t feel good. It hinders me is more ways than I can count. My kids will face all sorts of challenges and craziness in this world. I want them to carry their own stuff. They don&#39;t need to carry mine too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But then I have doubts.

If all I cared about was the results. But I do <br/>\ncare about the relationship more, though.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is so much more than just the relationship with the parents. It is their relationship with themselves. It is their relationship with the entire world. I don&#39;t want my kids to mirror my beliefs. I don&#39;t want my kids to go through life believing everything they see and hear. I want them to go through life questioning authority. I want them to go through life thinking and acting critically. I want my kids to do the right things for the right reasons. I don&#39;t want my kids to believe everything I tell them. I want them to question me even if it makes me uncomfortable. I don&#39;t expect all of my kids to be close to me. It may end up that we have personalities that clash and it may mean that we come to a place where we love, trust, and respect each other without being close. If that happens, I am okay with that. It may not be easy and it may force me to re-examine my own thoughts and my own beliefs. I want my children to develop into the people that they were destined to become on their terms. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: To deepen my understanding of the unschooling we are doing","postDate":"1262375554","msgId":42665,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhobGpxMitzcW1tQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCM0UzMENBLjQwODAxQHlhaG9vLmNhPg=="},"prevInTopic":42663,"nextInTopic":42668,"prevInTime":42664,"nextInTime":42666,"topicId":42637,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t think it s just about the relationships between parents and children.
