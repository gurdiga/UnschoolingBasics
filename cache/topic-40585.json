My oldest son (who is almost 11) does not quite understand money, and often complains about it.  He is a very intense personality wants instant gratification.  I do my best to meet this need, but it can be frustrating sometimes.  One thing we have done, is set up a bank account for him, and we keep his transaction register on the wall where he can see it.  We live around the corner from the bank so each time he receives money or his allowance, we will all walk to the bank together and make deposits.  (he LOVES this!) Being able to have and spend his own money, and see the transactions on the wall has helped him gain more of an understanding of where money goes.<br/>\n======================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve explained this to her.

This is about<br/>\npersonal limits and boundaries.  Your daughter has a right to not view his<br/>\nnudity if it bothers her.  Girls at the age of 11 are becoming more aware of<br/>\ntheir bodies and sexuality and of course she is uncomfortable.  It&#39;s an<br/>\nawkward age filled with hormones and emotions.  Maybe talk about this as a<br/>\nfamily as it appears to bother dad too.  I think letting everyone come up<br/>\nwith ideas of how to work through it is good.  Maybe ask your son if he<br/>\nwould be willing to wear clothing in the shared areas of the house and have<br/>\na nude-fest-free-for-all while in the privacy of his own room.  Everyone<br/>\nparticipating in a cooperative effort so that everyone has room to be<br/>\nthemselves while also not making others uncomfortable is a good thing with<br/>\nreal-world value.  I know I&#39;m not hearing the whole story, but it does sound<br/>\nlike little brother&#39;s joyful experience interferes with big sister&#39;s joyful<br/>\nexperience at home and often away from home.  There is a need for balance<br/>\nhere and prompting the kids to work together on a solution may do wonders<br/>\nfor building their relationship.  Even just talking about it as a family may<br/>\nhelp.  I think it is kind of sad that your daughter wants to go back to<br/>\nschool to get away from her brother.

They needed time to get to know each other. Ray needed time to deschool from the expectation that &quot;peers&quot; meant people the same age and gender, and from the expectation that he was automatically &quot;in charge&quot; if he was the oldest person in the room. Plus he was confused and jealous that Mo was &quot;getting away with&quot; things he wouldn&#39;t have when he was younger. All those things took time and love and some conversations! to resolve. As Faith said, finding ways for them to do things together *and* ways to stay out of each other&#39;s way was a valuable part of that process. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] daughter wants to go back to school...","postDate":"1245847625","msgId":40587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwNjI0MDU0N3UzYTAwZGFjYXc3MTQzMDBlZmFkNTJlNDZiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGgxdDNpZCtmOGFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGgxdDNpZCtmOGFnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40585,"nextInTopic":40591,"prevInTime":40586,"nextInTime":40588,"topicId":40585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OP: We left school in December and found un-schooling in February.

I would love to hear your thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\n***Well there is no school right now. So perhaps she can sit back and enjoy<br/>\nher summer.

There is no reason to take it personally.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: 2. She wants to &quot;study&quot; a curriculum so I have found a cool science<br/>\nprogram on-line, a long list of recommended books for sixth-graders, and a<br/>\nmath curriculum. We got a few of the books and we&#39;re hanging on to the<br/>\ncurriculum information. This seems to make her feel more secure about the<br/>\nidea of being home. If she wants to school at home, I&#39;ll get the curriculum<br/>\nstuff for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That sounds like you are showing respect for her needs. She needs the<br/>\nsecurity of school, that&#39;s all she has known. Perhaps you can suggest that<br/>\nshe let it go for a while and enjoy the summer. De-school yourselves a bit.<br/>\nShe can just explore her interests without worrying about school.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP::3. She has tons of interests - real-estate, acting, directing, design,<br/>\ncomputers - so I am connecting her with adults who have expertise in those<br/>\nareas. We got her an new apple lap top and she is taking classes at the<br/>\napple store. A friend of the family who is a real estate agent took her out<br/>\nto see houses for sale. We are almost done redecorating her brother&#39;s room<br/>\nand she led the way with ideas and resources. My challenge there is her<br/>\nlittle brother who refuses to go out of the house. So, sometimes I go with<br/>\nmy daughter and take my son to my dad&#39;s house. Sometimes I stay home with my<br/>\nson. Sometimes I leave my son home on his own, when his dad is only 5<br/>\nminutes away at work. I wish I could go with my daughter everytime and so<br/>\ndoes she...<br/>\n<br/>\n***I understand my ds doesn&#39;t like to leave the house either. It sounds like<br/>\nyou are being creative and finding some solutions. Can you think of more?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso try to look at it from his perspective rather than &quot;refuses&quot;. He is<br/>\nunwilling to go out for a reason. Find out why. See what you can work with.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: 4. She loves to ride her bike so I am riding with her. This is harder<br/>\nfor me... I feel like I need to be cooking or keeping up the house or just<br/>\nchilling out, but I am doing my best to leave those thoughts behind and go<br/>\nriding with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I think we all feel like that from time to time. She needs you a lot<br/>\nright now and it is a lot to give. Perhaps you can find a house keeper to<br/>\ncome help keep up on things. Of you could prepare meals early so you just<br/>\npop them in at the necessary time. I have a friends who cooks once a month!<br/>\nI am not there yet but I hope to be. She prepares her main dishes and<br/>\nfreezes them. She might cook a side or make a salad a few times. It saves a<br/>\nlot of time. Look for ways to save time. You can ask dd to clean with you or<br/>\nhang out and talk while you clean.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n5. She is struggling with friends... she had close friends at school, yet<br/>\nthey live in other neighborhoods and she doesn&#39;t like to call them about<br/>\ngetting together. I am reaching out on her behalf, but sometimes it seems<br/>\nnot fast enough for her. She&#39;d love some friends in the &#39;hood, but there<br/>\naren&#39;t many girls her age. She has made some homeschool friends but they<br/>\nlive 45 minutes away. We try to visit as much as we can. I keep reaching out<br/>\non her behalf to find new friends and to connect with old ones. I&#39;d love to<br/>\nempower her to ride her bike to visit her friends, and that is something I<br/>\ncan work on by riding with her more often and showing her the routes.<br/>\n<br/>\n***What did you do when she was in school? Did you help her make hang out<br/>\ndates? Did you drive her around to the places she wanted to go? If she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to call them can you? Can she email or even snail mail them?<br/>\nMake a nice hand done invitation to a party? It sounds like you have some<br/>\nplans in the works. These things don&#39;t happen over night. relax. I drive to<br/>\nother states to hang out with my oldest&#39;s unschooling friends. We travel to<br/>\nas many conferences as we can. I have even started a local conference (Enjoy<br/>\nLife Unschooling). I just drove her to NYC to hang out with a cousin and be<br/>\na mother&#39;s helper for 2 1/2 weeks. Before that we drove an hour 1/2 to met<br/>\nanother unschooler to hang out. Theya re going to see Green Day together. It<br/>\ncan take a lot to find friends.<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n6. She describes &quot;relaxed home-schooling&quot; as an approach she&#39;d like to take.<br/>\nSome core curriculum stuff with everything else approached more like<br/>\nun-schooling. Sounds good to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I don&#39;t think that she has a grasp on unschooling and perhaps you don&#39;t<br/>\nyet either. That&#39;s ok, keep reading, keep asking questions. She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsound like she trusts herself. Has she read How to Quit School and Get a<br/>\nReal Life? She might like it.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n7. She says she&#39;d like to go to a private school and we don&#39;t have any money<br/>\nfor that. I do my best to explain the finances, which are tight since I quit<br/>\nworking. Any thoughts on keeping the idea of abundance alive while working<br/>\nthrough the reality of living pay-check to pay-check???<br/>\n<br/>\n***It might help to re-think what abundance means to you. I sometimes make<br/>\nlists. I have a vision board for our family that we write what we want on.<br/>\nIt helps us see the path. It make take a while but we always get there. I<br/>\nhave a list on my phone that I check off when I get the thing I wanted. It<br/>\nis really cool to see all the things I have gotten. Occaisionally my oldest<br/>\nmakes list. She made a gratitude list a while back. She wrote down all teh<br/>\nthings she had and was grateful for. It was huge! And ended up not being all<br/>\nthings.<br/>\n-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Her brother likes to be naked all day and she hates seeing him nude. She<br/>\nwon&#39;t let him in her room without clothes. And, she tries to bargain with<br/>\nhim - she&#39;ll help with his computer questions if he puts on some shorts.<br/>\nHubby would like to lay down the law with our son. I prefer to ask, but not<br/>\nexpect a change. Would love some ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\n***That&#39;s her problem. She can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be allowed to control his<br/>\nchoices. You may want to talk with her about her feeling rather than allow<br/>\nthe controling and coercing. Being naked feels good why would you all want<br/>\nhim to stop something that feels good just because you are hung up about<br/>\nnudity?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n9. She says that she wanted to homeschool so that she could be with me and<br/>\nnot with me and her brother...she will sometimes say that she wants to go<br/>\nback to school in order to get away from her brother.<br/>\n<br/>\n***well they were seperate for a really long time.
