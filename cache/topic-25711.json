If they are really ignoring her or <br/>\nI think they might be rude to her, then I will probably intervene.  <br/>\nBut I was talking about how a lot of parents look at me like it is <br/>\nmy job to stop my dd talking to them.  I&#39;m not sure I agree with <br/>\nthis assumption, and I&#39;m also not sure that it is my duty to avoid <br/>\nhurting another child&#39;s feelings by being honest if I don&#39;t want to <br/>\nplay with them right now or listen to them when I would rather be <br/>\nwith my own child.  I don&#39;t think other parents should expect me to <br/>\nbe like a parent to their child when I don&#39;t even know them.  It <br/>\nsounded like this is what was annoying to you, so if you don&#39;t think <br/>\nother parents should expect this, then why would you expect it of <br/>\nyourself or feel like you have to entertain the kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, most kids know when they are being rejected.  I am just <br/>\nwondering if others here feel like this is always a bad thing.  <br/>\nShould we protect our children from other people not being <br/>\ninterested in them?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because every child is different.

His grandmother was hovering over this poor kid every second<br/>\nand giving out a continuous string of commands - &quot;be careful!&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;don&#39;t climb that&quot; and &quot;you shouldn&#39;t use those steps&quot;.

She would <br/>\noften get hired to decorate rich peoples houses for christmas with <br/>\ngreenery etc. In addition, she would always be asked to decorate <br/>\ntheir christmas trees with the home owners own ornaments. That way <br/>\nthe tree would look &#39;just so&#39;.  My friend felt this to be such a <br/>\nsoulless pursuit. She didn&#39;t mind doing the greenery, but it really <br/>\nbothered her to decorate someone else&#39;s christmas tree for pay. To <br/>\nher it seemed very decadent, but to me it seemed very sad that they <br/>\nwere missing out on the ritual of decorating their own tree.<br/>\nI feel that many parents don&#39;t enjoy the time they spend with their <br/>\nkids. This is very sad for the kids. But I think it is sadder for the <br/>\nparents. I was a kid who was not enjoyed, most of the time, and it <br/>\nmade me feel really bad and had many negative effects on me. But it <br/>\nalso lead me to consciously choose a different life for myself. I <br/>\nenjoy my children tremendously. Everyday with them is a gift that I <br/>\nam thankful for (even when I am exhausted :-)).  My mother didn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy the time with her kids and doesn&#39;t enjoy her grandchildren. She <br/>\nsees them only a few times a year even though she lives ten minutes <br/>\naway. Sometimes I feel bad for my kids that they don&#39;t have a doting <br/>\ngrandmother. Sometimes I feel bad for myself that I don&#39;t have the <br/>\nhelp of family to look after my three kids. But mostly I feel bad for <br/>\nmy mother, because she will never know how to connect with any of us <br/>\nand will never know that joy. Her experience of parenting was <br/>\nprimarily resentment. I think that in her way she did the best that <br/>\nshe could for her kids. I think most parents do. But many don&#39;t see <br/>\nthat any real connection with their kids is even possible. Many more <br/>\nparents just haven&#39;t found the fun in it. For me, it is important to <br/>\nfeel compassion for these parents AND their kids. I can&#39;t imagine <br/>\nanything sadder than not enjoying time spent with your own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmilie<br/>\n<br/>\n  At 02:56 PM 13/08/2007, you wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Just offering another perspective here.

In hindsight, we should have just stayed home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see a lot of what you&#39;re talking about though. It seems like the<br/>\nkids are SO hungry for attention.

We went to the  <br/>\n&gt; park today and I was engaging with Payge. Another girl approached us  <br/>\n&gt; and started to play with us.

All the  <br/>\n&gt; while her mother is just sitting at a picnic table doing absolutely  <br/>\n&gt; nothing. It happens all the time.

Pretty soon my dh who hasn&#39;t seen his kids much  <br/>\n&gt; that week because he worked lots of overtime is entertaining someone  <br/>\n&gt; else&#39;s child (while his dad sits on his cell phone and talks) and  <br/>\n&gt; missing out on time he devoted to our daughter.

Sometimes I&#39;m at the park with my two kids by myself  <br/>\n&gt; entertaining a child, when the parent only has that one child to tend  <br/>\n&gt; to!
