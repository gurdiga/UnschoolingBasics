My DD (6) has a homeschool friend from our group whom she has <br/>\nbeen spending a lot of time with.  The girl is (8) and they have recently had a sleepover <br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis situation seems very complex but I&#39;ll try and keep it simple.  <br/>\n<br/>\n During their sleep over the friend chewed on some art pencils that are very important to <br/>\nmy daughter.  She asked her to stop and she didn&#39;t.  The friend didn&#39;t seem to want to <br/>\ntake any responsiblity for her actions and while my daughter was cying asked me to make <br/>\nher stop.  I told her that I couldn&#39;t stop her from being upset because that was how she <br/>\nwas feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter my daughter calmed down she asked for something to eat.  After eating they began <br/>\nto play and watch T.V. together.  I checked with my daughter to see if everything was o.k.. <br/>\nand she said yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then my daughter has asked for a hampster and her friend offered her a cage.  My <br/>\ndaughter agreed to include her friend in getting the hampster.  Since then the girl has <br/>\ncalled many times to tell my daughter how to care for it, how much money she needs from <br/>\nme, that she has a list of names she should choose from.  These calls began to upset my <br/>\ndaughter - she felt as though her friend was trying to control the situation.  This is <br/>\nprobably a fair to say.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that my daughter was acting out.  I kept checking in with her about having the <br/>\ngirl participate in selecting the pet and she kept saying that she wanted her to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night before my daughter seemed especially on edge, she finally admitted that she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want the girl to come.  Early in the day she said that she was afraid that the girl <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to be her friend anymore.  She feels like the friend is telling her what to do <br/>\nand also brought up the situation from the sleepover.  My daughter feels the girl is telling <br/>\nme to shut her up when she cries.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spoke to the girls mother, she understood but sent an email the next day that the girl <br/>\nwas upset, crying all night and into the morning.  The girl feels betrayed by my daughter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls mother and I hope there is something to be learned by all in the situation.  Both <br/>\ngirls seem too upset right now to heal the situation easily.  Just wondering if anyone has <br/>\nany advise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in a very small homeschool group with this family and would like to try and figure <br/>\nsomething out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShannon<br/>\nMom to <br/>\nMackenzie (6)<br/>\nNate (2)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14844,"nextTopicId":14834}}
