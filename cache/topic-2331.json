Those of <br/>\nyou who have older kids and toddlers how do you balance out the time?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n******************************************************************************<br/>\n**********<br/>\nThis is a great question. One that I have some answers to and one that I too <br/>\nhave questions for but I will ask in another post.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are 12 (b),4.5(g),2(b) and 3 month (b). My 12 yr. old loves to <br/>\nsurf which makes it very challenging to go to the beach with a 4yr old who isn&#39;t <br/>\nafraid of water, a 2 yr. old who loves to explore and a newborn who is still <br/>\nnursing for food and comfort. In this situation we have gone but not as much. <br/>\nI have explained that next year I will be much more mobile and the year after <br/>\nthe same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe oldest will still accept Chucke Cheese or the Jokers (just not as safe <br/>\nwhen they are busy). <br/>\nA few weeks ago I took the kids to do a tour at Stoney Field Farm (yogurt <br/>\nfactory). I was fairly stressed as to how it was going to go with just me to care <br/>\nfor them. They did great! Being new at having four I was reassured that <br/>\ntaking the kids into a closed environment other than Walmart would be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo balance out the time I try to include them in decisions and compromise (or <br/>\ntry to:). If I go to the store at night time when my husband is home I take <br/>\nall but the 2 yr. old. If my son wants to go with just himself and I we discuss <br/>\nit with the 4 yr. old and she usually understands.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that I think sometimes I do feel the my 12 yr. old gets the <br/>\nshort end but I do try to work on that. The problem is that what he wants to do <br/>\nat times costs money that I dont have. All his friends attend school so they <br/>\nare often wanting to go, go, go esp now during the summer months. My kids dont <br/>\nneed to run all the time but I do see the difference in what they see as fun vs <br/>\nthe other children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess thinking about it each of my kids has their own thing they like to do <br/>\nwith mommy and daddy. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou could talk to them about what they would like to do. Toddlers are great <br/>\nbut at night time it can be a very moody time. This is when I take time with my <br/>\noldest alone (well with 3 mo old also, for now). I may attend a movie or we <br/>\nmay go to Barnes and Noble and just grab books/mags and chat. My son used to <br/>\ndislike books and book stores but once he discovered that he had 100% of my <br/>\nattention he asks to go now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 4 yr. old loves to shop,explore,sew,cook, talk,etc... So she is very easy <br/>\nto entertain. Come to think of it they all like to do anything they just want <br/>\nto know im listening.<br/>\nLaura~Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":175155280,"authorName":"Lanie Carlson-Lim","from":"&quot;Lanie Carlson-Lim&quot; &lt;pyxiewytch@...&gt;","profile":"pyxiewytch68","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"balancing older and younger children&#39;s needs","postDate":"1090895713","msgId":2331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTcwMWM0NzM4MiQ1OGIzYWYxMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBMQVJSWT4=","referencesHeader":"PDBJMUgwMEs2UkswTldSQGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2334,"prevInTime":2330,"nextInTime":2332,"topicId":2331,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Just roll with it Sherri-Lee and you ll be amazed when you just watch.

Last weekend it was after 10 pm and Eric and his friend were making up this elaborate game with digimon.  It was amazing...and I was thinking &quot;this is why unschooling is so great...because it&#39;s after ten in July and he&#39;s learning and it &quot;counts&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue they are always learning, but now that it&#39;s summer and &quot;schools&quot; out I can relax a little and see the benefits of unschooling...Here in delaware we have to have 180 days of school, but I&#39;m counting starting now, because learning is always happenning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been hard because my older son, who is 11 chose to stay in school, so sometimes there is a little bit of an issue between the boys with his &quot;school&quot; homework and having to get up early and my 8yo still has a bit of a schooled mentality we are working through.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am trying to be prepared for are those learnable moments when he wants to be involved in some activity and having the resources or ability to go &quot;do&quot; it and balancing that with my toddlers needs.
