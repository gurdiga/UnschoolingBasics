She has interests.  All kids do.<br/>\nSome are just harder to recognize than others.  What is she doing when<br/>\nshe is &quot;bored at home?&quot;  Are you doing this with her or watching from<br/>\nthe sidelines saying, &quot;I wish she would DO something&quot;?  What are you<br/>\ndoing to make your life look richer and fuller?  Are you participating<br/>\nin your passions?  Does she see you do this?  What is something that<br/>\nyou have wanted to do?  Maybe that &quot;paint your own ceramics studio&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;free day at the art museum&quot;  Make plans to go and then say, &quot;Hey, the<br/>\nart museum is having a free day and there is a Salvador Dali<br/>\nexpedition - you know the melting clock guy.  I was thinking of going<br/>\non Tuesday, wanna come along?&quot;  If she says no, then go without her.<br/>\nNext time she may want to go (especially if you bring back some cool<br/>\nfree literature or postcards or something.)  Most of the time when I<br/>\nmention that I am going off to do something (hike in the woods, go to<br/>\nthe cultural center, walk the mall, go thrift store shopping, go on a<br/>\n&quot;pelican hunt&quot; ( Pensacola has artistic pelican statues all over<br/>\ndowntown), head to the health food store, etc.) I get a chorus of &quot;Oh<br/>\nI want to go!&quot;  Sometimes they all come sometimes only one or two<br/>\ncome.  I do the same thing when I am doing stuff around the house.<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m going to bake some cookies.  Anyone want to join in?&quot;  or &quot;I&#39;m<br/>\ngoing to make some cards, care to join?&quot;  We are always going to the<br/>\nvideo store for new movies to watch together (we&#39;ve been on a Johnny<br/>\nDepp and Tom Hanks kick lately - although not together sadly).<br/>\n<br/>\nFill your life up and let her know that she can join you.  Look for<br/>\nthings that aren&#39;t &quot;join in&quot; activities outside the house if she is<br/>\nmore reserved.  Our local &quot;arts center&quot; has a &quot;Friday night try me<br/>\nnight&quot; periodically and all kinds of artisans are there doing<br/>\ndifferent things.  Maybe it is making glass beads or glass blowing or<br/>\npaper mache or weaving.  It&#39;s sort of a cross between artists &quot;showing<br/>\noff&quot; and &quot;hands on displays&quot;  There are little cafes near by where you<br/>\ncan pick up a meal and walk down to the center.  She might like<br/>\none-on-one connections with someone who is doing something she likes<br/>\nrather than a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Help!!","postDate":"1156973727","msgId":16967,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNUYxMDdDLUZFMUItNDM2NC04OUI1LUVGNUFCOTU2QTNFOEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVkNDVhaCs4OGltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVkNDVhaCs4OGltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16949,"nextInTopic":16968,"prevInTime":16966,"nextInTime":16968,"topicId":16949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You know what struck me about all the options?

That they all require  <br/>\na lot of our kids, scheduled times, requirements for attendance,  <br/>\nrules and formalities, not to mention the preformed groups that  <br/>\nalready exist.  What about taking her to a perfect swing (or whatever  <br/>\nfamily fun center you have?) or the movies, or just the mall. Hang  <br/>\nout in the arcade at any of those places. My girls love to just go to  <br/>\nthe mall, they do NOT like going someplace to meet specific people or  <br/>\ndo specific things. They usually wind up meeting with someone, and  <br/>\nhaving a good time, with no expectations or requirements for ever  <br/>\ntalking to that person again. Of course, it usually takes an hour or  <br/>\ntwo of hanging out before they get out and do something, so it&#39;s  <br/>\ndefinitely an investment in time.<br/>\nJust something I noted...hope you KWIM<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (9), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (5), Dan  <br/>\n(3), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 30, 2006, at 8:54 AM, sara_boheme wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I made suggestions about<br/>\n&gt; ways to meet other kids her age (park days, sports, co-ops, clubs or<br/>\n&gt; classes- I mean the opportunities are endless!), but she doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; want any of that either!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231753155,"authorName":"sara_boheme","from":"&quot;sara_boheme&quot; &lt;Superchick400@...&gt;","profile":"sara_boheme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Help!!","postDate":"1156946065","msgId":16949,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVkNDVhaCs4OGltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16967,"prevInTime":16948,"nextInTime":16950,"topicId":16949,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My 11 year old dd announced today that homeschooling was boring and that she wanted to go to school.

I aksed her why she felt that way <br/>\nand she explained that she doesn&#39;t see kids her own age and in <br/>\nschool she would get to do things like go on field trips and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be confined to the house. I reminded her that she isn&#39;t <br/>\nconfined to the house and that we do lots of stuff field trip wise. <br/>\nI explained that we live in a wonderful area where if she had an <br/>\ninterest we could follow it and find something fun to do or see. She <br/>\nreplied that she &quot;doesn&#39;t know&quot; what she wants to do (imagine that <br/>\nsaid in a whine). I made mild suggestions that were all met with <br/>\na &quot;not interested&quot;. I also told her that if she was interested in <br/>\nschool we could arrange for her to follow another student around for <br/>\na day. She doesn&#39;t want to do that either. I made suggestions about <br/>\nways to meet other kids her age (park days, sports, co-ops, clubs or <br/>\nclasses- I mean the opportunities are endless!), but she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant any of that either!!! It&#39;s like she&#39;s thristy but refuses to <br/>\ndrink anything despite the water I offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you have to understand that dd is a mild mannered, somewhat <br/>\nreserved child. She and I get along wonderfully.Whining isn&#39;t her <br/>\nthing. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is a result of not <br/>\nbeing able to see her best friend as often as in the past. We used <br/>\nto get together with best friends family once a week, but now bf&#39;s <br/>\nmother is doing a more rigid school style and our meetings will be <br/>\nsporadic at best. I&#39;ve told her that she can still write or email <br/>\nbest friend to feel closer to her. But the fact is that dd doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave many friends her age. She has a few homeschooled friends that <br/>\nwe see once in awhile because I try to arrange playdates, etc. We <br/>\nplay outside, but there aren&#39;t any girls her age in the neighborhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I do unschooling wise when she is bored or lonely? Any <br/>\nsuggestion I make is met with an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;. Is she just <br/>\noverwhelmed with choices? Should I sign her up for a class despite <br/>\nher protests? ACK!! Please help!
