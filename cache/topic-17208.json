I&#39;m about to give some advise that I haven&#39;t taken  <br/>\nmyself. &lt;g&gt;   My DH goes through periods of the same  thing.  Right now, the young <br/>\nguys that work for him are next to worthless,  and when he comes home no one <br/>\nseems to pay attention to the orders he barks  around here.  So, he&#39;s very <br/>\nconcerned that our kids are going to grow up  unable to do anything like the people <br/>\nthat work for him.  I&#39;ve talked until  I&#39;m blue in the face and sometimes he <br/>\ncan see that our kids are at least no  worse than the others on the block who <br/>\nare &quot;disciplined&quot;.  Every once in  awhile he can see that our kids actually do <br/>\nfollow more directions than  those other kids.  An example, we have an empty <br/>\nlot near us and the owner  politely asked that the kids not play there because <br/>\nof snakes and other  hazards.  I told my children and only once have they <br/>\ngone over there again  in the last year, but the neighbor children I tell EVERY <br/>\nDAY and sometimes more  than once a day.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I am considering purchasing the Unconditional Parenting DVD by  Alfie <br/>\nKohn.  I have the book, and I think it is one that appeals to the dad  point <br/>\nof view.  I told my husband that Kohn is not a touchy-feely  unschooler, but a <br/>\neducational reform writer and a business writer.  That he  can deal with!<br/>\n <br/>\nThe DVD is expensive enough at about thirty dollars to not rush  out and get <br/>\nit (on his website _www.alfiekohn.com_ (http://www.alfiekohn.com) ) but I will <br/>\ndo so if I  need to.  My DH is in a more positive place right now, so I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t gotten  it yet.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve also gotten on the Scott Noelle Daily Groove newsletter and I forward  <br/>\nthem to DH.  I don&#39;t know if he reads them, but he seems to be working at  <br/>\nbeing a more mindful parent.  That is at _www.enjoyingparenting.com_ <br/>\n(http://www.enjoyingparenting.com) <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks to whomever recommended that a few weeks ago.  I&#39;m enjoying it  very <br/>\nmuch!<br/>\n <br/>\nI know how difficult it is Dana, people truly don&#39;t understand.  Our  <br/>\nmarriage counselor recently quit on us because she disagreed with my parenting  <br/>\nstyle.  She thought that the &quot;kids ran the house&quot; and even my husband was  saying <br/>\n&quot;no, I&#39;ve been in those houses, it&#39;s not like that&quot;.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132314989,"authorName":"Dana Ashby","from":"Dana Ashby &lt;twilightravyn@...&gt;","profile":"twilightravyn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New to the group...need a little help.","postDate":"1158279893","msgId":17208,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTE1MDAyNDUzLjE4Njg5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNTEwLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNTgyNjI2MTEuMjQyLjcyODQ1LncxMDFAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17214,"prevInTime":17207,"nextInTime":17209,"topicId":17208,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all!
