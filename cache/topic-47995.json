And to create that it takes getting to know your kids so you can provide them with support in exploring what interests them and a wealth of opportunities within reach that you believe might appeal to them to expand their interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is hard to grasp because it involves understanding the &quot;why&quot; (the principles and purpose of unschooling) so you can figure out the &quot;what&quot; that will work for your family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s when I suggested the Teenage Liberation<br/>\n&gt; Handbook (maybe there&#39;s a better one?) that my 16 yr. old asked me to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;assign&quot; pages for him to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would he like you to read it to him?

We have done Charlotte Mason for years, but I got","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1209914320\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new to this list and am wondering if anyone can share what their high<br/>\nschoolers do (or don&#39;t do).  We have done Charlotte Mason for years, but I<br/>\ngot really overwhelmed when I had a difficult pregnancy and then a new<br/>\nbaby.  She is now 2 and I&#39;m STILL not motivated to do much of anything.  I<br/>\nhave a lot of guilt about that, but there&#39;s no use in wallowing, it&#39;s time<br/>\nto do something about it.  So, I have a friend who introduced me to<br/>\nunschooling.  My kids are 16 (17 next month), 14, 7, almost 5 and my<br/>\ndaughter turned 2 a couple of weeks ago.  So, I understand how to do this<br/>\nwith the younger kids, that&#39;s easy.  It&#39;s the high schoolers that I&#39;m at a<br/>\nloss about.  In fact, this past year, we haven&#39;t done much of anything at<br/>\nall.  I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t agree with that statement, since it&#39;s impossible<br/>\nto do NOTHING.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 16 yr. old has expressed interest in going to college.  He was always<br/>\nstrong at math until we got to algebra.  We haven&#39;t done anything beyond<br/>\nbasic math, other than a year ago, when we struggled with algebra.  He has<br/>\na part time job at a fast food restaurant and wants to work about 25-30<br/>\nhours (he bought a car, so needs to pay for it and insurance, since we<br/>\ncan&#39;t), which I think is great.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy reading and doesn&#39;t seem<br/>\nto have much interest in anything else, so I don&#39;t know what to do.  He did<br/>\nask me to assign him pages in The Teenage Liberation Handbook, because he<br/>\nwants to read it, but says he never will, unless I assign him pages.  So, I<br/>\ntold him I&#39;d do that for him.  I want to help him be ready for college, but<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to do that without getting &quot;schooly.&quot;  I have read some<br/>\nstories about unschoolers going to college and am thinking he&#39;ll be ok, if<br/>\nhe starts at a community college, which is about all we could afford right<br/>\nnow, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 yr. old is very involved with music.  He took a few years of piano<br/>\nlessons when he was younger and teaches himself songs from the radio and<br/>\nmakes up his own.  He plays the bass guitar (self-taught) in the church<br/>\nband and is teaching himself the acoustic guitar.  He spends much of his<br/>\nday, in his room, playing.  He also works at the same restaurant that my 16<br/>\nyr. old works at.  He can&#39;t work as many hours, due to his age, but works<br/>\nwhat he can and loves it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, they aren&#39;t doing anything right now, other than watching<br/>\nNetflix at night or playing video games on occasion.  So, since I&#39;m fairly<br/>\nclueless, is there something else I should be doing with them?  Critique<br/>\naway!<br/>\n<br/>\nJodi<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47997,"nextTopicId":47990}}
