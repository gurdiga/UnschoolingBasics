What I can say is that my own experience has been that it has<br/>\n  felt important and fulfilling to me to meet the nursing needs of my kids,<br/>\n  who have expressed a tremendous need to nurse that has carried over until<br/>\n  they are older than what is the accepted societal norm here in the U.S.<br/>\n  (which you may be interested to know is much different than the norm in<br/>\n  other countries where the average weaning age is much higher and societal<br/>\n  acceptance of that much greater).  Other than the usual soreness and pain<br/>\nat<br/>\n  the beginning of nursing, I have not experienced the ongoing pain that you<br/>\n  described - sometimes that type of pain is due to improper positioning or<br/>\n  improper latch on by the baby, but I do know that my sister experienced<br/>\nmany<br/>\n  months of pain with the nursing of her first daughter even with a lot of<br/>\n  support and info on proper positioning and so forth from la leche and a<br/>\n  private nursing consultant, so partly I think that if you got the latch on<br/>\n  and positioning correct, then women&#39;s bodies are just different.  Also,<br/>\n  babies nurse differently.  My daughter was a polite kind of gentle nurser<br/>\n  and my son was a &quot;barracuda&quot; nurser who was much rougher and at one point<br/>\n  tore my nipple on one side in several places - so I did go through a lot<br/>\nof<br/>\n  different things with him teaching him to be more gentle, which he now is.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The benefits my kids get in my eyes with extended breastfeeding are they<br/>\nare<br/>\n  still getting the antibodies that help them not get sick from my<br/>\nbreastmilk<br/>\n  (they have been insanely healthy), they are getting the incredible comfort<br/>\n  factor when they are scared or hurt, we all get the ongoing bonding<br/>\nbenefits<br/>\n  of it, and it is a fabulous calming down tool which is such a benefit for<br/>\n  both them and me - my son is three now and we are going through many daily<br/>\n  tantrums over all that he wants to do exactly the way he wants it all by<br/>\n  himself when that doesn&#39;t happen - and &quot;num num&quot; is a way he can choose to<br/>\n  break the escalating cycle of upset, reconnect and regroup.  Sometimes he<br/>\n  chooses other options, but it is his favorite one.  There are also plenty<br/>\nof<br/>\n  kids that decide they are done quite early, and I wouldn&#39;t encourage my<br/>\nkids<br/>\n  to nurse past when they felt they were done!  It is something I find I can<br/>\n  provide to them that they express to me that they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That said, I&#39;ve been through several periods when I was tandem nursing<br/>\nboth<br/>\n  of them, when I needed to honor and discuss my own needs with them and<br/>\nwork<br/>\n  out limits to the nursing - when my nipple was torn and I was only nursing<br/>\n  on one side for a while I negotiated with my older one to nurse less since<br/>\n  it was a killer on my one breast that was functioning.  And there was a<br/>\n  period when my son was one and my daughter was three and the combined<br/>\namount<br/>\n  they wanted to nurse was more than I could handle.  I decided it was more<br/>\n  important to try to nurse my daughter as long as she wanted, as opposed to<br/>\n  as much as she wanted right at that point, so I talked to her and we<br/>\nworked<br/>\n  out limits to her nursing until we got to the point where her demands were<br/>\n  not exceeding my ability to do it.  I have seen my sister be unable to do<br/>\n  this with her daughter, resulting in her increased frustration and<br/>\ninability<br/>\n  to continue nursing at all, so I felt it was important to listen to my own<br/>\n  needs and figure out what would work best for all of us together, which at<br/>\n  that point was not my daughter nursing every time she wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One last word on feeling embarrassed.  We live in a culture in this<br/>\ncountry<br/>\n  that unfortunately fosters that feeling.  I have battled it myself,<br/>\n  particularly as my kids have gotten older.  I have realized that it was<br/>\n  important for me both to put the needs of my kids over my embarassment,<br/>\nbut<br/>\n  also to try to do what I could to make that easier on myself.  With an<br/>\nolder<br/>\n  child asking to nurse in public, a lot of times you can negotiate for<br/>\ndoing<br/>\n  it later unless it&#39;s an emergency.  If my older child asked because she<br/>\nwas<br/>\n  hurt or upset then I would nurse her on the spot, perhaps taking a minute<br/>\nto<br/>\n  find, if possible, a more private way to do it if that made me more<br/>\n  comfortable.  I actually have not encountered that much disapproval of my<br/>\n  extended nursing, most of it has just been dealing with my own fear of<br/>\nthat<br/>\n  which has gotten easier as time has gone on and I&#39;ve logged in a lot of<br/>\n  nursing miles and surrounded myself with other like minded folks who have<br/>\n  made me feel comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Wow, that was long.  You got me on one of my favorite subjects!  Hope that<br/>\n  speaks to what you are wondering about...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joan<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: G&M Contracting Inc., Kenneth Gillilan<br/>\n  [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gmcontractinginc@...\">gmcontractinginc@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, June 04, 2004 6:53 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] I have a few more questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I always let my kids chose for themselves, since they<br/>\n </span></blockquote>  on-demand breastfed (well, one still does at 6 you).<br/>\n  Of course, when they were first trying new foods they<br/>\n  didn&#39;t ask for cheetos, they just grabbed what was on<br/>\n  my plate.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Dana,<br/>\n     Please don&#39;t take offense to what I am about to say, but I never could<br/>\n  understand the extended breastfeeding theory.

He is easily distracted, i.e. he&#39;s<br/>\nnursing out of habit, is hungry, so asks to nurse. I offer food, and the<br/>\nnursing is forgotten. I think he nursed two days ago, I can&#39;t remember.  My<br/>\nolder child, at 3 years nursed a couple of times a day (if I remember<br/>\nright!).

He is easily distracted, i.e. he&#39;s nursing out of habit, is hungry, so asks to nurse. I offer food, and the nursing is forgotten. I think he nursed two days ago, I can&#39;t remember.

What I can say is that my own experience has been that it has<br/>\nfelt important and fulfilling to me to meet the nursing needs of my kids,<br/>\nwho have expressed a tremendous need to nurse that has carried over until<br/>\nthey are older than what is the accepted societal norm here in the U.S.<br/>\n(which you may be interested to know is much different than the norm in<br/>\nother countries where the average weaning age is much higher and societal<br/>\nacceptance of that much greater).  Other than the usual soreness and pain at<br/>\nthe beginning of nursing, I have not experienced the ongoing pain that you<br/>\ndescribed - sometimes that type of pain is due to improper positioning or<br/>\nimproper latch on by the baby, but I do know that my sister experienced many<br/>\nmonths of pain with the nursing of her first daughter even with a lot of<br/>\nsupport and info on proper positioning and so forth from la leche and a<br/>\nprivate nursing consultant, so partly I think that if you got the latch on<br/>\nand positioning correct, then women&#39;s bodies are just different.  Also,<br/>\nbabies nurse differently.  My daughter was a polite kind of gentle nurser<br/>\nand my son was a &quot;barracuda&quot; nurser who was much rougher and at one point<br/>\ntore my nipple on one side in several places - so I did go through a lot of<br/>\ndifferent things with him teaching him to be more gentle, which he now is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits my kids get in my eyes with extended breastfeeding are they are<br/>\nstill getting the antibodies that help them not get sick from my breastmilk<br/>\n(they have been insanely healthy), they are getting the incredible comfort<br/>\nfactor when they are scared or hurt, we all get the ongoing bonding benefits<br/>\nof it, and it is a fabulous calming down tool which is such a benefit for<br/>\nboth them and me - my son is three now and we are going through many daily<br/>\ntantrums over all that he wants to do exactly the way he wants it all by<br/>\nhimself when that doesn&#39;t happen - and &quot;num num&quot; is a way he can choose to<br/>\nbreak the escalating cycle of upset, reconnect and regroup.  Sometimes he<br/>\nchooses other options, but it is his favorite one.  There are also plenty of<br/>\nkids that decide they are done quite early, and I wouldn&#39;t encourage my kids<br/>\nto nurse past when they felt they were done!  It is something I find I can<br/>\nprovide to them that they express to me that they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I&#39;ve been through several periods when I was tandem nursing both<br/>\nof them, when I needed to honor and discuss my own needs with them and work<br/>\nout limits to the nursing - when my nipple was torn and I was only nursing<br/>\non one side for a while I negotiated with my older one to nurse less since<br/>\nit was a killer on my one breast that was functioning.  And there was a<br/>\nperiod when my son was one and my daughter was three and the combined amount<br/>\nthey wanted to nurse was more than I could handle.  I decided it was more<br/>\nimportant to try to nurse my daughter as long as she wanted, as opposed to<br/>\nas much as she wanted right at that point, so I talked to her and we worked<br/>\nout limits to her nursing until we got to the point where her demands were<br/>\nnot exceeding my ability to do it.  I have seen my sister be unable to do<br/>\nthis with her daughter, resulting in her increased frustration and inability<br/>\nto continue nursing at all, so I felt it was important to listen to my own<br/>\nneeds and figure out what would work best for all of us together, which at<br/>\nthat point was not my daughter nursing every time she wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last word on feeling embarrassed.  We live in a culture in this country<br/>\nthat unfortunately fosters that feeling.  I have battled it myself,<br/>\nparticularly as my kids have gotten older.  I have realized that it was<br/>\nimportant for me both to put the needs of my kids over my embarassment, but<br/>\nalso to try to do what I could to make that easier on myself.  With an older<br/>\nchild asking to nurse in public, a lot of times you can negotiate for doing<br/>\nit later unless it&#39;s an emergency.  If my older child asked because she was<br/>\nhurt or upset then I would nurse her on the spot, perhaps taking a minute to<br/>\nfind, if possible, a more private way to do it if that made me more<br/>\ncomfortable.  I actually have not encountered that much disapproval of my<br/>\nextended nursing, most of it has just been dealing with my own fear of that<br/>\nwhich has gotten easier as time has gone on and I&#39;ve logged in a lot of<br/>\nnursing miles and surrounded myself with other like minded folks who have<br/>\nmade me feel comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, that was long.  You got me on one of my favorite subjects!
