Your dd doesn&#39;t sound &quot;bad&quot; at all. <br/>\nI know what you mean, intense kids have really incredible qualities. <br/>\nFor many of them I think their brains are just going way too fast, <br/>\neverything needs to be now and exactly what they have in mind. For my <br/>\nds1, when he has all of me, he is calm, thoughtful, and really a joy <br/>\nto be with. Ds2 goes to bed a couple hours earlier than Sam, so Sam <br/>\nand I always have a couple of hours in the evening to play games, <br/>\nread, talk, do projects together. And these are my favorite times <br/>\nwith him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had two wonderful days now. I find that often when I&#39;m just <br/>\nstarting to feel like I&#39;m going to crack and I reach out for help, <br/>\nthe challenge goes away or shifts. I used to joke that all I had to <br/>\ndo is complain about a nursing issue at a La Leche League meeting and <br/>\nthe issue would go away the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your idea of getting someone to spend time with one or both <br/>\nkids would be a good idea. There are so many homeschoolers in this <br/>\narea I may even look for a pre-teen to act as a mother&#39;s helper when <br/>\nI&#39;m home and just need a bit of a break. It should be fun for the <br/>\nboys too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear more about how others with more than one child <br/>\nmanage to honour each child&#39;s needs/wants when they really differ <br/>\nfrom the other child&#39;s. I find so much of my day is spent coaching <br/>\nthrough situations of, &quot;okay how can we help both of you to be happy <br/>\n[or needs/wants met] now.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Faith Void&quot; <br/>\n&lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My dd is very intense.

She even taught my dd to<br/>\nswing on the swings by herself. I got to relax, shower etc. I don&#39;t know<br/>\nabout the relational issues as dd felt so intense to me that I waited to<br/>\nhave #2 until she was almost 6. I was still able to give her a lot at that<br/>\nage. She was almost 8 before ds began to assert his preferences, namely to<br/>\nstay home and play (like your second). And I had to be quite attentive to<br/>\nher socialization (with any other child) as she doesn&#39;t pick up clues very<br/>\nwell. geez, I hope this doesn&#39;t make her sound bad or like I don&#39;t<br/>\nappreciate her many wonderful qualities.

Sam doing an<br/>\n&gt; activity without one of us is very new (these two 3-hour sessions a<br/>\n&gt; week at the Waldorf home). This was something he wanted to do but I<br/>\n&gt; went with him the first five times (with his little brother Quinn).<br/>\n&gt; Each time I&#39;d ask after a while if he&#39;d mind if I went off for a walk<br/>\n&gt; or something but he wanted me to stay. The sixth time after an hour I<br/>\n&gt; asked him if he was okay with Quinn and I going to run some errands.<br/>\n&gt; He was completely fine with it. So this is a big change for us. He<br/>\n&gt; has been acquainted with this woman for several years as she puts on<br/>\n&gt; kid&#39;s shows at many summer events around here. A few of the kids<br/>\n&gt; there are also good friends of his. All of the kids at this place,<br/>\n&gt; except one, are homeschoolers or unschoolers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Until his brother was born he was an &quot;easy&quot; kid. Easy because all his<br/>\n&gt; needs were being met. He needed to be in constant reach of me and I<br/>\n&gt; was always there. Over the last three years he has gone from a quiet<br/>\n&gt; toddler who always just sat and watched to a child who rarely stops<br/>\n&gt; talking and is always going a mile a minute cutting up pieces of<br/>\n&gt; paper into tiny pieces or writing endless receipts for something. But<br/>\n&gt; I have to be involved in this. He is very sweet and very fun. Under<br/>\n&gt; the dining room table he has a restaurant, a toy store, and an<br/>\n&gt; office. This morning I &quot;ordered&quot; a chai latte and toast from him and<br/>\n&gt; I had to fill out five forms, sign my name in three different places,<br/>\n&gt; all these papers got stapled together, then he wrote me a &quot;check&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; had me sign one more time on a receipt. He is busy. The difficulty is<br/>\n&gt; that he needs me to be there involved all the time. But I have<br/>\n&gt; another child too! The problems arise when Quinn wanders into the<br/>\n&gt; fray and wants to get under the dining room table (the precious zone)<br/>\n&gt; or wants to nurse, wants a story read, then Sam can sometimes lose<br/>\n&gt; control. Quinn gets bitten, pinched, kicked and so do I. Sometimes I<br/>\n&gt; gently restrain Sam while talking to him gently, identifying what I<br/>\n&gt; feel he might be feeling, telling him I need to keep everyone safe in<br/>\n&gt; the house. Sometimes it takes an hour for him to calm down. He needs<br/>\n&gt; all of me, sharing me or dh with Quinn is what causes almost all of<br/>\n&gt; his meltdowns. On a bad day, I might spend up to three hours dealing<br/>\n&gt; with these situations. It&#39;s hard for me to shower, eat or get dressed<br/>\n&gt; on these days.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We have had some very good phases where the two boys have played well<br/>\n&gt; together. Sam has demonstated good negotiating skills with Quinn<br/>\n&gt; (which I don&#39;t even expect for a 6-yr old) and can be very sweet with<br/>\n&gt; and protective of Quinn. I&#39;m asking what others with intense kids do<br/>\n&gt; to help get through their kids&#39; phases since we are going through a<br/>\n&gt; particularly challenging one right now.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Away from home the things that he really likes are watching real<br/>\n&gt; people working. Ds2 loves this too. We&#39;ll stop and sit down on the<br/>\n&gt; sidewalk for an hour if there&#39;s a window washer working, an excavator<br/>\n&gt; digging, a concrete mixer pouring. He is too uncomfortable asking<br/>\n&gt; anyone questions but I&#39;ll ask lots of questions for him when he asks<br/>\n&gt; me to. We&#39;ll ask the parking meter reader questions, the post office<br/>\n&gt; worker filling up the posties&#39; drop boxes, anything we see.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But we can&#39;t spend all our time out. Ds2 loves many of the same<br/>\n&gt; things but he loves being home as well and eventually he&#39;ll be beside<br/>\n&gt; himself saying &quot;Go home!&quot; Ds1 also likes being home but my feeling is<br/>\n&gt; that our little house with so many toys wings Sam out a bit. But like<br/>\n&gt; someone else who posted about her daughter here a while back, he is<br/>\n&gt; one of those kids that loves novelty, new things, new experiences. So<br/>\n&gt; we hit a lot of garage sales and thrift shops to meet these needs. He<br/>\n&gt; gets intensely attached to anything that comes into the house.<br/>\n&gt; Occasionally we pick out things to return to thrift shops or to drop<br/>\n&gt; at friends&#39; houses with younger children. I feel that if our house<br/>\n&gt; were far less busy clutter-wise, he&#39;d be calmer. He has some great<br/>\n&gt; playmates with a pretty wide age range but lately he&#39;s unable to<br/>\n&gt; handle the excitement of anyone more than one other person coming<br/>\n&gt; over. For now we are doing everything we can to keep social<br/>\n&gt; interactions successful so he doesn&#39;t feel badly later and so other<br/>\n&gt; parents don&#39;t label him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So please what do those with intense kids do so that the other kids<br/>\n&gt; in the house get a piece of you too (and your own personal hygiene<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t fall completely off the map)?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Susan<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; It sounds like he needs a lot of stimulation, but its not really<br/>\n&gt; &gt; clear what kind - is he really social? physical? you say he &quot;soaks<br/>\n&gt; &gt; everything up&quot; - can you bring more things into the home for him<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to &quot;soak up&quot;?

Our oldest is bright and very busy. He needs to be <br/>\nwith us (and that&#39;s me mostly) all of the time. He does not really <br/>\nplay on his own at all and needs to be monitored closely when he is <br/>\nplaying with his younger brother. We have gone through really smooth <br/>\nphases with him where I can actually eat breakfast before noon <br/>\nsometimes, get out of my pajamas and maybe even get a cup of tea. But <br/>\nthere are many days that those things are not possible because I am <br/>\nmeeting his endless needs and/or protecting ds2 simply by being right <br/>\nthere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of the home he is so easy since he is a major observer. He <br/>\njust is so busy soaking everything up. So I do my best to get out of <br/>\nthe house as much as possible. The difficulty is my youngest would <br/>\nlove to be home more to play with his toys and gets tired from all <br/>\nthe constant &quot;field trips&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear any suggestions. We&#39;re going through a particularly <br/>\nchallenging spell right now and dh and I are getting drained.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27253,"nextTopicId":27251}}
