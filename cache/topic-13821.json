In some of our subcultures and some foriegn cultures<br/>\n&gt; spitting is normal, expected, and accepted -- I mean look at<br/>\n&gt; baseball and the Chinese!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>See, this right here encapsulates, for me, the sheer beauty and wonder<br/>\nof RU parenting and how the learning emerges from the partnership<br/>\ninherent in the parenting.  This is exactly the problem with making<br/>\nacross the board rules--they&#39;re narrowing and limiting and downright<br/>\nfalse in certain situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nA mainstream parent would make a rule--no spitting--that looks the<br/>\nsame for every mainstream parent out there, and they&#39;ll all support<br/>\neach other on it and pat each other on the back about such a common<br/>\nsense and obvious rule. Quite the contrary, we could sample 10 RU<br/>\nfamilies and find 10 inspirational and different solutions to a<br/>\nproblem that involve really cool and amazing and interesting and<br/>\nfascinating connections made along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, I love unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Cathy!<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (8), Julia (7), Sam (5)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13820,"nextTopicId":13797}}
