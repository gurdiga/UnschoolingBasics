But I find myself taking action, by pulling away from friends and family who practice punitive measures with children, lately. They don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; my way, and I feel accausted by theirs. I have this strong visceral reaction when I see what appears to be injustice. And silence doesn&#39;t suit me, so I withdraw instead. <br/>\n  I&#39;ve worried lately that I&#39;m being intolerant, by pulling away. That I&#39;m acting as if I judge them. I think I withdraw out of self-preservation, more than anything.

The kids are making <br/>\nreasonable requests or just acting like kids and they get punished <br/>\nor shamed. I have started to speak up- telling about how wrong it is <br/>\nto let children &quot;cry it out&quot; how it effects them as adults or how <br/>\nwrong &quot;time out &quot; is. But recently I have been connecting to the <br/>\nchildren- talking to them, asking questions, listening to them. It <br/>\nis amazing to see a kids eyes light up when you activitly engage <br/>\nthem. Maybe I can show them a different way. Then again I do not <br/>\npunish my kids for wanting or expressing needs and always ask what <br/>\nthey want on their plate and what they need. Most of all I ask them <br/>\nnot tell them. My family already thinks I am the weird one anyway <br/>\n(leaving the family religion and so forth) so I figure why not let <br/>\nthem in on parenting as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing is that my mom has noticed that parents are harsh <br/>\nand that she can see the fear in the kids eyes. Sad. so sad. One <br/>\nfamily at a time and we can maybe someday change the culture of <br/>\nparenting.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Re-phrasing WAS Transitioning","postDate":"1183899651","msgId":24898,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2cW42MysyNHJoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDcwNzA3MjE0NXIxNTg3NDAwMGkyNDI4ZWRkNDc0N2RjYWE2QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24896,"nextInTopic":24906,"prevInTime":24897,"nextInTime":24899,"topicId":24896,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Anyone else done any proselytizing out there?~~ Oh sure.:) It s a fine-line to walk because I probably would have about 1/2 the friends we have if I said","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1965545229\">~~Anyone else done any &quot;proselytizing&quot; out there?~~<br/>\n<br/>\nOh sure.:)<br/>\nIt&#39;s a fine-line to walk because I probably would have about 1/2 the<br/>\nfriends we have if I said what I really want to say.

Very positive spin on that old saw - I like that. I<br/>\n&gt;find it really useful, talking with my conventional parenting<br/>\n&gt;friends, to be able to re-state those sorts of truisms from a<br/>\n&gt;different perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve recently found myself talking with a couple other parents about some<br/>\ntough &quot;parenting situations&quot; we each have encountered.  The one I remember<br/>\nmost was a buddy of mine giving me the classic &quot;time out&quot; scenario for being<br/>\nbad (his ds is 2, gimme a break), or a &quot;No way am I gonna lose this battle<br/>\nof wills.&quot;  Usually I just nod my head and smile nervously.  This time I<br/>\ntold him point-blank that DW and I have embarked on what is probably a very<br/>\ndifferent view of discipline and interacting with our children.  To his<br/>\ncredit, he actually appeared to listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t give him the whole spiel.  Heck, I&#39;m not sure what the whole spiel<br/>\nis.  I did tell him two things, though.  In Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Unconditional<br/>\nParenting,&quot; in response to the classic &quot;What&#39;s WRONG with you?  Are you deaf<br/>\nor something?!&quot;  Kohn would just love for the child to respond, &quot;NO, I&#39;m<br/>\nTHREE!&quot;  That was good for a chuckle, and hopefully it stuck.  Humor can do<br/>\nthat.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing I told him was in response to the parent who does nothing<br/>\nwhen his/her kid is &quot;behaving badly,&quot; say at a party or at dinner, or<br/>\nsomething else.  The &quot;permissive, I&#39;m-your-buddy parent.&quot;  IThe situation<br/>\nneeds to be addressed.  Just differently than what most parents do.  When<br/>\nthat happens, especially with dd2, she has some need that has to be met.<br/>\nSleep, food, a re-connect with us, something.  Of course, we need to ensure<br/>\nthat dd2 stops pummeling Timmy.  However, the &quot;solution&quot; is not a time-out<br/>\nin the popular sense, or spanking, or a good yelling at.  Our parenting<br/>\nculture is so behavior-based that it treats the kids like pets.  If they&#39;re<br/>\nacting up, there&#39;s something going on inside their heads.  That needs to be<br/>\naddressed.  And yes, sometimes it&#39;s mind-reading, but you get better at it.<br/>\nAnd you start treating your kid as a person, not a pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one other thing.  When you&#39;re &quot;enforcing justice,&quot; i.e. &quot;I&#39;m taking that<br/>\ntoy away from you because you took it from Timmy,&quot; or whatever it may be --<br/>\n(some may disagree with me here, but ) not only is it being hypocritical to<br/>\ntake a toy away and say &quot;don&#39;t take things,&quot; but the other &quot;lesson&quot; she may<br/>\nlearn is that &quot;Daddy can be a real butthead.&quot;  I&#39;m not the Enforcer of<br/>\nJustice or the Arbiter of Fairness.  If my actions put her on the short end<br/>\nof the stick, then I&#39;m the Bad Man.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t know how he took it all. Maybe he won&#39;t invite us over to his place<br/>\nafter all.  We&#39;ll see.  But it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve felt comfortable<br/>\nre-framing a common situation with a different perspective.  Both parents<br/>\nare really good people.  They just emphasize the &quot;carrot&quot; side of the<br/>\nbehavior-focused coin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough self-aggrandizement.  Anyone else done any &quot;proselytizing&quot; out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n--Rob<br/>\nDH to Seana for 10 years<br/>\n&quot;Daddy!&quot; to Genevieve (5) and Elissa (4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24901,"nextTopicId":24890}}
