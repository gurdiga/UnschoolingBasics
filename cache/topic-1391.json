I think that it is very<br/>\ndifficult to find time to do something that gives to<br/>\nyou and sometimes even harder to figure out what that<br/>\nsomething is.  Just this year i am really feeling a<br/>\nflow to our lives and finally feel as though i am<br/>\nfiguring out what i need and what fills me up and<br/>\nactually doing it.  Part of my shift is in not trying<br/>\nto find time to do things alone as much as blending me<br/>\nand my needs with my childs.  I think it is so<br/>\nimportant to do that practice time late at night and<br/>\nreally just love it when it happens.  Talk about what<br/>\nmakes you feel peaceful and full to your son.  I keep<br/>\ntelling my kids to find what gives them that feeling<br/>\nand go there as often as they can.  I do believe that<br/>\nmy kids need to see me doing things i love, i want<br/>\nthem to see it and remember me enjoying my hobbies and<br/>\nloves and it doesn&#39;t have to be seperate from them<br/>\nmost of the time.  One of the things i love this time<br/>\nof year is the beach and we all feel full and peaceful<br/>\nthere so that is what we have been doing alot lately. <br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck on your path, you will know what is right<br/>\nfor you and your family and it will click for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nlove and peace<br/>\ndina --- <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:BillAndrea@...\">BillAndrea@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am Andrea, mom to two great sons: a 29 year old<br/>\n&gt; and a 4 year old.  I joined <br/>\n&gt; this list from seeing it mentioned on the<br/>\n&gt; NoMoreSpanking list and have been <br/>\n&gt; reading posts here somewhat addictively!  My older<br/>\n&gt; son was raised/schooled <br/>\n&gt; pretty &quot;conventionally-unconventionally&quot; ie<br/>\n&gt; Montessori school.  Now in my second <br/>\n&gt; career as a mom I am questioning and being forced to<br/>\n&gt; question a lot.  My 29 yo <br/>\n&gt; has such an accomodating personality I was pretty<br/>\n&gt; unprepared for my feisty <br/>\n&gt; 4yo; he&#39;s caused me to search within and without for<br/>\n&gt; noncoercive ways of being <br/>\n&gt; with him and honoring him.  And as my own search for<br/>\n&gt; authentic living has become <br/>\n&gt; much more pressing (midlife crisis and all that) I<br/>\n&gt; really want my 4yo&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; wondrous lifeforce to blossom and not be<br/>\n&gt; squelched--which of course leads right <br/>\n&gt; into unschooling.  So I appreciate all the posts<br/>\n&gt; that have stretched my thinking <br/>\n&gt; and caused me to question a lot of my assumptions. <br/>\n&gt; Especially discussions of <br/>\n&gt; bedtimes, tv, food are, to me, probably most helpful<br/>\n&gt; in &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>\n&gt; underlying philosophy of trust.  I really<br/>\n&gt; appreciated all the posts about tv limits <br/>\n&gt; (which I have relaxed though not yet relinquished). <br/>\n&gt; A lightbulb for me was the <br/>\n&gt; post about &quot;what you do&quot; when you remove the<br/>\n&gt; arbitrary limit--ie. you sit with <br/>\n&gt; your child while he watches, you initiate<br/>\n&gt; discussions, answer questions, <br/>\n&gt; offer input about what might scare him.  There is so<br/>\n&gt; much real learning taking <br/>\n&gt; place--and also it is a lot more effort than just<br/>\n&gt; making up a rule (though come <br/>\n&gt; to think of it it may be less effort than enforcing<br/>\n&gt; said rule).  So I am in <br/>\n&gt; quite a state of flux and in the middle of<br/>\n&gt; integrating a lot of new ideas I&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; gotten here.  Many thanks to the list owners and all<br/>\n&gt; the posters!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My main fear in homeschooling ds (from here on, that<br/>\n&gt; means the 4 yo) is the <br/>\n&gt; recognition of my own needs and the limits on my<br/>\n&gt; energy.  Both my dh and I have <br/>\n&gt; always felt like we can never quite keep up<br/>\n&gt; energy-wise with ds (okay, I am <br/>\n&gt; 49 but my dh is only 40!).  From birth he has always<br/>\n&gt; needed/demanded a lot of <br/>\n&gt; attention (I don&#39;t mean that in a negative way, just<br/>\n&gt; that he was a baby who <br/>\n&gt; never wanted to be put down, slept relatively<br/>\n&gt; little, etc.)  Ds continues to <br/>\n&gt; sleep little, is just now winding down on nursing,<br/>\n&gt; and still wants to be with me <br/>\n&gt; *all* the time.  He is the type of child who wants<br/>\n&gt; LOTS of interaction, not <br/>\n&gt; just to play on his own while in the same room as<br/>\n&gt; me.  (I know he is only 4 but <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m talking about for short periods, not all day!) <br/>\n&gt; That plus various other <br/>\n&gt; reasons--no extended family in this area, dh works<br/>\n&gt; long hours, we live outside of <br/>\n&gt; town so trading child care is difficult--means there<br/>\n&gt; is just not much down <br/>\n&gt; time for me.  I want to honor the wonderful,<br/>\n&gt; creative person ds is but there <br/>\n&gt; seems to be a lack of balance that does affect my<br/>\n&gt; ability to be patient and fresh <br/>\n&gt; and creative with situations.  Ds has, I think, a<br/>\n&gt; basically more force-full <br/>\n&gt; nature than I do and from reading the &quot;spirited<br/>\n&gt; child&quot; type books I&#39;ve come to <br/>\n&gt; see that while he is &quot;spirited&quot; in the sense of<br/>\n&gt; persistence and energy I am <br/>\n&gt; &quot;spirited&quot; in the sense of having a lot of<br/>\n&gt; sensitivity issues and a big need for <br/>\n&gt; quiet and space.  (And my energy level is a little<br/>\n&gt; lower than it was 25 years <br/>\n&gt; ago.)  And while I can put some of my needs aside,<br/>\n&gt; over the long haul of <br/>\n&gt; parenting they do have to be honored to some extent<br/>\n&gt; or it just is not helpful to <br/>\n&gt; any of us.  (I guess I wrote that last sentence<br/>\n&gt; mostly for myself, because it&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; really hard for me to see this!)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gradually from reading various posts I&#39;ve come to<br/>\n&gt; see that a lot of my <br/>\n&gt; &quot;rules&quot; are a kind of backwards way of honoring my<br/>\n&gt; own needs.  Giving up an <br/>\n&gt; automatic/arbitrary rule means I have to be in touch<br/>\n&gt; with what my needs are right now <br/>\n&gt; and being able to articulate them enough so we can<br/>\n&gt; jointly come up with a <br/>\n&gt; workable situation.  Sometimes I can do this though<br/>\n&gt; I get the feeling I haven&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; had much practice with it!  The other day ds wanted<br/>\n&gt; to stop at Barnes & Noble <br/>\n&gt; (enroute home from another activity) and look at<br/>\n&gt; children&#39;s books.  I first <br/>\n&gt; started to say No, this is the time you usually fall<br/>\n&gt; asleep and you&#39;ll be grumpy <br/>\n&gt; and tired.  He challenged me (good for him!) and,<br/>\n&gt; thanks to this list, I was <br/>\n&gt; able to identify that (1) I was not able to buy<br/>\n&gt; anything that day and (2) I <br/>\n&gt; would probably start feeling woozy (from lighting,<br/>\n&gt; time since I last ate, etc.) <br/>\n&gt; after about 30 minutes.  I stated my own needs and<br/>\n&gt; we were able to agree on <br/>\n&gt; &quot;only looking&quot; and a time limit that he actually<br/>\n&gt; honored (leaving B&N is often <br/>\n&gt; *very* hard for us!).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But often I am unable to, on-the-fly, figure out my<br/>\n&gt; own limitations.  Or even <br/>\n&gt; if I know them ds is requesting so many things so<br/>\n&gt; fast I can&#39;t keep up with <br/>\n&gt; him.  Example: I am trying to clean up the glop from<br/>\n&gt; a big, abandoned clay <br/>\n&gt; project on the kitchen table; he is already in the<br/>\n&gt; yard screaming at me to, not <br/>\n&gt; just find his boots (which, by the way, he can<br/>\n&gt; clearly see and easily get on), <br/>\n&gt; but go outside immediately and put them on his feet<br/>\n&gt; while he stands astride his <br/>\n&gt; bicycle.  Even as I write this I can see that, when<br/>\n&gt; well rested, I can <br/>\n&gt; multitask cleaning glop and putting boots on.  But<br/>\n&gt; when I&#39;m not, I can&#39;t!  Though I <br/>\n&gt; still struggle with should I necessarily &quot;drop the<br/>\n&gt; glop&quot; and rush to put boots <br/>\n&gt; on.  And I don&#39;t like being screamed at.  (He was<br/>\n&gt; already on his bicycle when <br/>\n&gt; he decided he wanted the boots and didn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; get off.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So, I&#39;m interested in what others might have to say<br/>\n&gt; about balancing personal <br/>\n&gt; needs with parenting.  How do you get time for<br/>\n&gt; yourself?  I do just a bit of <br/>\n&gt; freelance music (would like to feel free to do more)<br/>\n&gt; and it seems like such a <br/>\n&gt; struggle to get practice time in.  Ds grabs at my<br/>\n&gt; instrument if I try to <br/>\n&gt; practice, seeing it as a rival for my attention.  I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t had much luck with <br/>\n&gt; helping him find something he can do alongside me as<br/>\n&gt; I practice, so I do it after <br/>\n&gt; he goes to bed (and that means if he chooses a much<br/>\n&gt; later bedtime than usual, <br/>\n&gt; it gets really hard).  It seems like my life really<br/>\n&gt; has to be integrated into <br/>\n&gt; our communal life.  As it is now, I feel I am trying<br/>\n&gt; to cram it all in during <br/>\n&gt; the rare times we are apart--and something seems<br/>\n&gt; wrong with that picture.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; A rare exception: last night it was late, he wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; tired, I said I really <br/>\n&gt; had to practice.  He himself (!) suggested that he<br/>\n&gt; color in my &quot;Anatomy Coloring <br/>\n&gt; Workbook&quot; (his latest fave thing to do) while I<br/>\n&gt; practice!  So we did till <br/>\n&gt; 11:15 pm, interspersing practice/coloring with<br/>\n&gt; investigations of what each <br/>\n&gt; other&#39;s clavicle felt like, etc.  That was great!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Of course, he was up at 6:30, same as usual.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading this long post.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Andrea, possibly in the middle of a major paradigm<br/>\n&gt; shift<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been<br/>\n&gt; removed]<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I joined <br/>\nthis list from seeing it mentioned on the NoMoreSpanking list and have been <br/>\nreading posts here somewhat addictively!  My older son was raised/schooled <br/>\npretty &quot;conventionally-unconventionally&quot; ie Montessori school.  Now in my second <br/>\ncareer as a mom I am questioning and being forced to question a lot.  My 29 yo <br/>\nhas such an accomodating personality I was pretty unprepared for my feisty <br/>\n4yo; he&#39;s caused me to search within and without for noncoercive ways of being <br/>\nwith him and honoring him.  And as my own search for authentic living has become <br/>\nmuch more pressing (midlife crisis and all that) I really want my 4yo&#39;s <br/>\nwondrous lifeforce to blossom and not be squelched--which of course leads right <br/>\ninto unschooling.  So I appreciate all the posts that have stretched my thinking <br/>\nand caused me to question a lot of my assumptions.  Especially discussions of <br/>\nbedtimes, tv, food are, to me, probably most helpful in &quot;getting&quot; the <br/>\nunderlying philosophy of trust.  I really appreciated all the posts about tv limits <br/>\n(which I have relaxed though not yet relinquished).  A lightbulb for me was the <br/>\npost about &quot;what you do&quot; when you remove the arbitrary limit--ie. you sit with <br/>\nyour child while he watches, you initiate discussions, answer questions, <br/>\noffer input about what might scare him.  There is so much real learning taking <br/>\nplace--and also it is a lot more effort than just making up a rule (though come <br/>\nto think of it it may be less effort than enforcing said rule).  So I am in <br/>\nquite a state of flux and in the middle of integrating a lot of new ideas I&#39;ve <br/>\ngotten here.  Many thanks to the list owners and all the posters!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main fear in homeschooling ds (from here on, that means the 4 yo) is the <br/>\nrecognition of my own needs and the limits on my energy.  Both my dh and I have <br/>\nalways felt like we can never quite keep up energy-wise with ds (okay, I am <br/>\n49 but my dh is only 40!).  From birth he has always needed/demanded a lot of <br/>\nattention (I don&#39;t mean that in a negative way, just that he was a baby who <br/>\nnever wanted to be put down, slept relatively little, etc.)  Ds continues to <br/>\nsleep little, is just now winding down on nursing, and still wants to be with me <br/>\n*all* the time.  He is the type of child who wants LOTS of interaction, not <br/>\njust to play on his own while in the same room as me.  (I know he is only 4 but <br/>\nI&#39;m talking about for short periods, not all day!)  That plus various other <br/>\nreasons--no extended family in this area, dh works long hours, we live outside of <br/>\ntown so trading child care is difficult--means there is just not much down <br/>\ntime for me.  I want to honor the wonderful, creative person ds is but there <br/>\nseems to be a lack of balance that does affect my ability to be patient and fresh <br/>\nand creative with situations.  Ds has, I think, a basically more force-full <br/>\nnature than I do and from reading the &quot;spirited child&quot; type books I&#39;ve come to <br/>\nsee that while he is &quot;spirited&quot; in the sense of persistence and energy I am <br/>\n&quot;spirited&quot; in the sense of having a lot of sensitivity issues and a big need for <br/>\nquiet and space.  (And my energy level is a little lower than it was 25 years <br/>\nago.)  And while I can put some of my needs aside, over the long haul of <br/>\nparenting they do have to be honored to some extent or it just is not helpful to <br/>\nany of us.  (I guess I wrote that last sentence mostly for myself, because it&#39;s <br/>\nreally hard for me to see this!)  <br/>\n<br/>\nGradually from reading various posts I&#39;ve come to see that a lot of my <br/>\n&quot;rules&quot; are a kind of backwards way of honoring my own needs.  Giving up an <br/>\nautomatic/arbitrary rule means I have to be in touch with what my needs are right now <br/>\nand being able to articulate them enough so we can jointly come up with a <br/>\nworkable situation.  Sometimes I can do this though I get the feeling I haven&#39;t <br/>\nhad much practice with it!  The other day ds wanted to stop at Barnes & Noble <br/>\n(enroute home from another activity) and look at children&#39;s books.  I first <br/>\nstarted to say No, this is the time you usually fall asleep and you&#39;ll be grumpy <br/>\nand tired.  He challenged me (good for him!) and, thanks to this list, I was <br/>\nable to identify that (1) I was not able to buy anything that day and (2) I <br/>\nwould probably start feeling woozy (from lighting, time since I last ate, etc.) <br/>\nafter about 30 minutes.  I stated my own needs and we were able to agree on <br/>\n&quot;only looking&quot; and a time limit that he actually honored (leaving B&N is often <br/>\n*very* hard for us!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut often I am unable to, on-the-fly, figure out my own limitations.  Or even <br/>\nif I know them ds is requesting so many things so fast I can&#39;t keep up with <br/>\nhim.  Example: I am trying to clean up the glop from a big, abandoned clay <br/>\nproject on the kitchen table; he is already in the yard screaming at me to, not <br/>\njust find his boots (which, by the way, he can clearly see and easily get on), <br/>\nbut go outside immediately and put them on his feet while he stands astride his <br/>\nbicycle.  Even as I write this I can see that, when well rested, I can <br/>\nmultitask cleaning glop and putting boots on.  But when I&#39;m not, I can&#39;t!  Though I <br/>\nstill struggle with should I necessarily &quot;drop the glop&quot; and rush to put boots <br/>\non.  And I don&#39;t like being screamed at.  (He was already on his bicycle when <br/>\nhe decided he wanted the boots and didn&#39;t want to get off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m interested in what others might have to say about balancing personal <br/>\nneeds with parenting.  How do you get time for yourself?  I do just a bit of <br/>\nfreelance music (would like to feel free to do more) and it seems like such a <br/>\nstruggle to get practice time in.  Ds grabs at my instrument if I try to <br/>\npractice, seeing it as a rival for my attention.  I haven&#39;t had much luck with <br/>\nhelping him find something he can do alongside me as I practice, so I do it after <br/>\nhe goes to bed (and that means if he chooses a much later bedtime than usual, <br/>\nit gets really hard).  It seems like my life really has to be integrated into <br/>\nour communal life.  As it is now, I feel I am trying to cram it all in during <br/>\nthe rare times we are apart--and something seems wrong with that picture.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA rare exception: last night it was late, he wasn&#39;t tired, I said I really <br/>\nhad to practice.  He himself (!) suggested that he color in my &quot;Anatomy Coloring <br/>\nWorkbook&quot; (his latest fave thing to do) while I practice!  So we did till <br/>\n11:15 pm, interspersing practice/coloring with investigations of what each <br/>\nother&#39;s clavicle felt like, etc.  That was great!<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, he was up at 6:30, same as usual.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea, possibly in the middle of a major paradigm shift<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1434,"nextTopicId":1351}}
