I am having a bit of a problem with my 9 year old son. I have <br/>\n<br/>\nbeen unschooling him and his three younger brothers and he is showing <br/>\n<br/>\nmajor frustration for friends and going places. I am limited for <br/>\n<br/>\ngoing lot&#39;s of places because of the fact that I have a one year old <br/>\n<br/>\nthat if you interupt his nap schedual he is very cranky. And the fact <br/>\n<br/>\nthat my older kids like to stay up late and sleep in late. I try to <br/>\n<br/>\nget out as much as I can and even participate in a homeschool group <br/>\n<br/>\nonce a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut My nine year old is not interested in much more than movies and <br/>\n<br/>\nplaystation no matter what we have going on and no matter what I <br/>\n<br/>\nstrew his way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy family live far away and the ones that live close work and have <br/>\n<br/>\nschool. He is to the point where he is having crying spells because <br/>\n<br/>\nhe wants kids his age to do things with and to play. None in the <br/>\n<br/>\ngroup are close to his age. I have asked if he wants to try out school<br/>\n<br/>\n(even though I am against the idea) but he always says no. But i <br/>\n<br/>\ndon&#39;t know if he is basing his decision because he has never gone and <br/>\n<br/>\nbecause of the negative things about it that i know he has heard from <br/>\n<br/>\nme talking  to others about it. I really don&#39;t know what to do. Does <br/>\n<br/>\nanyone else have this come up?Does anyone have thier children get <br/>\n<br/>\nconfused because they want more to do than whats at home but don&#39;t <br/>\n<br/>\nwant to go to school?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying everything to get him out more and look for different <br/>\n<br/>\npeople to be around but it just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate some advice.
