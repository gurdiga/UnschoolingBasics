It&#39;s interesting to see what words and<br/>\nmeanings our language doesn&#39;t have, that other cultures do.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, &quot;areodjarekput&quot;  in Inuit means &quot;to exchange wives for a<br/>\nfew days only.&quot; The Japanese word bakku-shan applies to &quot;a woman who<br/>\nseems pretty when seen from behind but not from the front.&quot;<br/>\n(bakku-shan)  And tingo from the title is an Easter Island word meaning<br/>\n&quot;to take all the objects one desires from the house of a friend, one at<br/>\na time, by borrowing them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m tempted to set up a new unschooling group for all us &quot;neko-nekos&quot;<br/>\n(Indonesian for someone whose creative ideas are blamed for making<br/>\nthings worse.)  Not to be confused with - but combined perhaps? - the<br/>\nYiddish nakhes, which means the pleasure and pride a parent enjoys from<br/>\nher child. Pam S. might know something about the Persian word for<br/>\nproducing &quot;ingenious, witty children&quot; - izraf.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe back jacket flap says English has long plundered foreign cultures<br/>\nfor new words and here are some we missed, arranged by theme the better<br/>\nto compare attitudes on universals like food, the human body, love and<br/>\nsex -- a feast of meaning &quot;for word lovers, laughter lovers and wisdom<br/>\nseekers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJJ<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.culturekitchen.com/jj_ross/blog\">http://www.culturekitchen.com/jj_ross/blog</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14080,"nextTopicId":14057}}
