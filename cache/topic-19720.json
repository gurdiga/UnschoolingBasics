When she was little <br/>\nwe used to put her hand on her heart and let her feel it racing after <br/>\na food that caused an obvious reaction. She still now will sometimes <br/>\ncome to me quietly and says &quot;Mum my heart is racing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s been more about trying to limit wheat and dairy which is where <br/>\nthe craving is coming in. I think we need to have a discussion on <br/>\nthis in particular and maybe come to a plan on how to deal with it <br/>\ntogether - what alternatives we can substitute them with, do we need <br/>\nto have them out of the pantry/fridge for a while? We have already <br/>\ndone this to some degree and have many alternatives available. We <br/>\nhave a visit with a naturopath coming up soon who said he could help <br/>\nwith finding the cause of the cravings (he felt it likely a <br/>\ndeficiency elsewhere in her diet). Hopefully this will help as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is great how many alternatives are becoming available in the <br/>\nstores now with all natural and organic foods. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again Julie, for helping me come to a potential solution,<br/>\nRegards Rebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Peters&quot; <br/>\n&lt;julieannpeters@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Rebecca,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can understand where you are coming from as my son (10) is <br/>\n&gt; sensitive to chemicals/colors as well.
