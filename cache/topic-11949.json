Can her hair be relaxed<br/>\nor straightened to do more what she wants?  It may be that she just needs a<br/>\nnice &quot;makeover&quot; to feel good about who she is.  Nothing drastic, just<br/>\nsomething new.  Maybe leave her at a salon for her to discuss what she wants<br/>\nwith someone who can tell her more what she can do with her hair.  (Just<br/>\nmake sure to put a price limit on the changes :) )&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to do a relaxer - I think 7 yrs old is too young for that.  Not to mention too damaging to her hair.  But I will do braids.  This weekend I&#39;m going to braid her hair.  She wants lots of skinny braids so I&#39;ll have to set aside a chunk of time.  I remember that my mom used to pay a neighbor of ours to braid mine and my sister&#39;s hair.  She didn&#39;t like to do hair too much.  I admit, I don&#39;t like to do hair much either!
