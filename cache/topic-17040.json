THANK YOU for <br/>\nyour time and wisdom. :)<br/>\nBut I also want to add that I think the issue I&#39;m more concerned <br/>\nabout is that she (dd)feels lonely. She has a limited # of friends, <br/>\n(which is fine - I try to explain to her that quantity is not the <br/>\nsame as quality) and the friends she has are from more rigid <br/>\nhomeschool families, so we have to &quot;plan&quot; time to see them and it&#39;s <br/>\nnot often. She wants more friends her age, but how does she <br/>\nnaturally go about making them? All the suggestions I offered were <br/>\nways she could meet more people and then perhaps connect with <br/>\nsomeone. She is shy and reserved and doesn&#39;t like to hang out at the <br/>\nmall or what have you. We do tons of stuff together that she and I <br/>\nboth enjoy: libaray, shopping, swimming pool, berry picking, <br/>\ncrafting, park days, etc. She has interetsts that she follows. I&#39;m <br/>\nnot as worried about that. For the most part we live a very free and <br/>\nunprocessed life, it&#39;s the fact that she feels lonely sometimes and <br/>\nwishes she had more friends. Again, I think this is because she <br/>\ncan&#39;t see her best friend as often, and it breaks my heart. I know <br/>\nthat being involved in an activity is no guarantee that she will <br/>\nmake friends, and I treasure the time that I spend with her because <br/>\nshe considers me a friend. It boils down to the fact that when your <br/>\nchildren are sad, you are sad. I just want to help her in some way. <br/>\nI am trying to find more unschoolers in our area for both of us!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\nSara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17038,"nextTopicId":17042}}
