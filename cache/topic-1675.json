What grade would she be in?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, it&#39;ll have to be some other thing.  The beach doesn&#39;t have much draw<br/>\nfor Syd at the moment.  She hasn&#39;t had any of her friends come with us very<br/>\noften lately.  It may be that she&#39;s kind of &quot;in between&quot; friends right now<br/>\nand school seems to her like a place she could belong and make more.  Her<br/>\ngirl scout troop is off for the summer as is gymnastics etc. so maybe she&#39;s<br/>\nbored.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would technically be going into 4th but I would think 3rd would be a<br/>\nbetter fit.  It annoys me that I even have an opinion on that.  ;b</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1664,"nextTopicId":1381}}
