I always found it interesting<br/>\nthat sometime during the preschool years even the most devoted AP<br/>\nstarted resorting to conventional parenting with arbitrary rules and<br/>\nlimits, rewards and punishments, and most importantly, the loss of<br/>\ntrust.  Trust in themselves as parents as well as trust in their<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe at the core of AP is meeting your baby&#39;s needs, and trusting<br/>\nthe instincts inherent in the child/parent relationship to ensure the<br/>\nbest.  The same is true as they get older.  Only they become more<br/>\ncompetent at articulating their needs as they get older, and, of course,<br/>\ntheir needs change.  But, it&#39;s the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading Dr. Sears&#39; Babybook where he encourages parents to<br/>\nnot say no to their babies and toddlers.  The example he gave was when a<br/>\ntoddler is a climber.  We shouldn&#39;t tell them no, we should make it safe<br/>\nfor them to climb.  Among the reasons was the fact that saying no isn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to keep them from climbing therefore, making it safe for them to<br/>\nclimb was the only logical and responsible thing to do.  The same<br/>\nexample can be applied to any age and any set of circumstances.  Don&#39;t<br/>\nsay no.  For one thing, they&#39;ll probably do it anyway and will have to<br/>\nlie to you to do it which damages your relationship.  If you support<br/>\nthem and facilitate whatever it is they want to do, while staying true<br/>\nto all your principles of safety and compassion . . ., you help them on<br/>\nso many levels with the added bonus that it strengthens your<br/>\nrelationship and makes for peaceful living.  Win-win all around:o)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it sounds a bit oversimplistic, and I don&#39;t even know if this is<br/>\nwhat you were looking for, but I hope it helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCristina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula","from":"&quot;Krisula&quot; &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: attachment parenting question","postDate":"1205708989","msgId":30984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDUwMWM4ODdiYSRkNjAwMjY2MCQ2NTAyYThjMEBlcG1kZWxsaG9tZT4="},"prevInTopic":30929,"nextInTopic":31080,"prevInTime":30983,"nextInTime":30985,"topicId":30840,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She has a 5 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  I hope it answers some of your question, it sure answered some of mine I didn&#39;t even know I had!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Jodi<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Five is challenging. But so is two, three, four, six, sixteen--all in<br/>\ntheir different ways. Part of the trouble is that our children move<br/>\nonward and forward through the different ages and stages, while we,<br/>\ntheir imperfect parents, have just figured out how to cope with the<br/>\npreceding one. Is it possible to attachment parent the older child?<br/>\nPossible, necessary, critical. And here is where the difference<br/>\nbetween AP &quot;things we do&quot;--co-sleeping, breastfeeding,<br/>\nbabywearing--and the AP &quot;things we are&quot; plays large. We don&#39;t carry<br/>\nour five year olds, the majority of us don&#39;t breastfeed them any more,<br/>\nwe&#39;re not necessarily co-sleeping with them. The &quot;do&quot; stuff is gone.<br/>\nThe &quot;be&quot; stuff is all that remains.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how do we &quot;be&quot; with the older children? I think this is one of the<br/>\npoints at which our paths can diverge quite dramatically. And I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow that there is one *right* answer. For what it is worth, based on<br/>\nmy sample of one five year old shepherded through some challenging<br/>\nstuff to date, this is my experience:<br/>\n<br/>\nAt five, ds&#39;s world got larger. We&#39;re unschooling, so the massive<br/>\nchange that is five day a week kindergarten wasn&#39;t part of it--but<br/>\nthink of what a huge change that is, and how hard it must be sort out,<br/>\neverything so new--but it was so clear that a five-year-old was so<br/>\ndifferent from a four-year-old. And absolutely, we butted heads<br/>\nbecause while he had moved on, I was still mothering a four-year-old.<br/>\n<br/>\nA huge breakthrough for me was to make this world larger--ride his<br/>\nbike on (safe!) streets, cross the street on his own, go into stores<br/>\non his own, play a bigger role in everything. I can&#39;t quite remember<br/>\nall the different changes we did, but they&#39;re pretty much<br/>\nirrelevant--they wouldn&#39;t work for your child. But maybe look at what<br/>\nyou can do--talk with her, what would she like to do now that she<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t (or wasn&#39;t interested) in doing a year or six months ago?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I always come back when we run into &quot;downs&quot;: the only<br/>\nperson whose behaviour I can control is myself. And if I am unhappy<br/>\nwith how my child is acting, the first step is not to look for a way<br/>\nto change my child, but to look at myself, within myself, and ask<br/>\nmyself what can I do to change how I am reacting and communicating<br/>\nwith my children? What am I doing--reflexively, thoughtlessly--that I<br/>\nshould change. Start with me. When I&#39;m okay, when I&#39;m balanced, when<br/>\nI&#39;m grounded--well, very often, the problem goes away, because it was<br/>\nin me in the first place. My children mirror me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if the problem really is in the other--if it is all my dh(5)<br/>\nbeing crazy or my ds(3) being whiney--when I&#39;m taking care of myself,<br/>\nreflecting on my behaviour, and acting from a place within me that&#39;s<br/>\ngrounded, well, then I can cope and talk and help them sort through<br/>\nwhatever craziness they are going through at the time without losing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly, strongly believe that any punishment--be it a time out, a<br/>\nwithdrawal of privileges, or the most innocuous manufactured<br/>\nconsequence--does not help these situations but serves to drive a<br/>\ntiny, but ever growing, wedge between the attached parent and child.<br/>\nThe absolutely best thing I&#39;ve ever read about discipline was in<br/>\nGordon Neufeld&#39;s Hold On To Your Kids--absolutely aimed at parents of<br/>\nolder children, through to teens. We&#39;ve talked about this before, but<br/>\nthis is the essence of what I take away from Neufeld&#39;s chapter on<br/>\n&quot;Discipline that Does Not Divide&quot;: &quot;Is [whatever action you were going<br/>\nto take] going to further your connection to your child? Or is it<br/>\ngoing to estrange you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do I do when I kind of want to throttle ds? I work at<br/>\nre-connecting. I call them re-attachment days. Have a bath together.<br/>\nWrestle (I&#39;m not advising it for pregnant mamas :). Go for coffee<br/>\n(for me) and cookie (for him) at the cafe, just the two of us.<br/>\nReally focus on him and try to enjoy him. So often, that&#39;s what he&#39;s<br/>\nasking for my being obnoxious--really focused, one-on-one attention<br/>\nfrom me. Now if I could only ensure I always give it to him so that we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t go through the head-butting phase before I remember!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I do in the moment? That&#39;s way harder in practice, no<br/>\nquestion. When I&#39;m really frazzled, I leave notes to myself in<br/>\nconspicuous places with &quot;when ds does x&quot; &quot;do not say/do this&quot;<br/>\n&quot;say/do this.&quot; (Fridge and front door best places. Also, bathroom<br/>\ndoor.) And I tell my children what they are--&quot;Those are reminders to<br/>\nme of how I want to treat you and talk to you, even when what you are<br/>\ndoing makes me very, very angry.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I sing, &quot;I want to holler really loud, but I&#39;m trying<br/>\nreally hard not to, someone help me figure something else to do, I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m going to stand on my head to distract myself...&quot; (This works<br/>\nreally, really well with two and three year olds too, btw.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, I don&#39;t catch myself in time and do all the things I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to do: yell, threaten (if there is an &quot;if&quot; and a &quot;then&quot; in a<br/>\nsentence, it&#39;s almost always a threat)... and then I apologize, try to<br/>\nrewind, move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd always, always, I remind myself that 1) the worst behaviours<br/>\nusually occur just before huge developmental/emotional milestones,<br/>\nchanges and breakthroughs, 2) my child is acting in the best way he<br/>\nknows at this moment, and if that way is not acceptable to me, I need<br/>\nto help him find another one, and 3) I love the little bugger more<br/>\nthan life or the universe, no matter how obnoxious he is. (This is a<br/>\ngood exercise too: after a hard, hard day, sit down and make a list of<br/>\nall the things you love about your little one. From the shadow her<br/>\neyelash make on her cheeks when she sleeps to the way she kisses you<br/>\ngoodnight... everything you can think of.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, finally, if I want my children to treat me--and others--with<br/>\nrespect, I must treat them with respect.
