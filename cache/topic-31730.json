Everyone poops and you didn&#39;t get a guarantee when you were born that no one would ever poop where it was inconvenient for you. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first moved into our house, the dogs from across the street came over to help us.  They pooped on the lawn of the house next door to us.  The woman who lived there, big deal activities director at her church, big time religious lady, *lost her mind* ranted, acted like a freaking nut and hollered at their person to clean it up.  It was a lot of poop, they were big dogs, but the poor bugger had ALS and had a hard time just getting across the street.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose pooping dogs were way more pleasant neighbors than church lady.  The guy who let his dogs get away from him for a few minutes to poop was a much nicer neighbor.  I knew if I ever had an accident, (don&#39;t usually poop accidentally, but like, if I dropped a sack of groceries or something) poopy dogs and poopy dog owner would be way more likely to come to my aid then the other neighbor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBe nicer than my ranting neighbor.&lt;g&gt;  Remember that people and dogs are more important than dog poop. &lt;g&gt;   If you&#39;re going to get excited about something, get excited about being a nice person.    If you were considering doing something mean go out of your way to do something nice with all that energy and you&#39;ll feel better about yourself tomorrow.   That I can guarantee.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe man with pooping dogs was Gary La Fontaine, for any fly fishermen out there. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis <br/>\n*i did enjoy the typo, though, of the neighbor who was a boor.&lt;g&gt;*<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you do? Your neighboor and her kid come into your property,<br/>\nlets the dog poop right in front of the door to go into your back yard<br/>\nand she leaves it there. It just happend to me. My mom says to put the<br/>\npoop in a bag with a note telling her she forgot something in our yard<br/>\nand carefully place it on her front steps for her to find. This is<br/>\nreally bothering me, What would you do?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31716,"nextTopicId":31732}}
