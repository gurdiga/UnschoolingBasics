We thought it was cute and made it a game when he was young and so he<br/>\nwould smile and laugh when he did it and by the time he had teeth and it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t so cute anymore. We learned then that it takes longer to unlearn<br/>\nsomething then it took to learn something so yes it is time and patience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is also a biter and every once in a while she tries to kiss me<br/>\nby biting my mouth. I don&#39;t always think it is intentional as it was with my<br/>\nson more of hey look what I learned to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like most things we do with this age instead of no try the do this<br/>\ninstead when she tries to bite we give her something she can bite. &quot;It hurts<br/>\nme when you bite mommy. You can bite a carrot... (My son hated carrots, my<br/>\ndaughter loves them.) Or you can use a chew toy or whatever you have around<br/>\nthat would be safe to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, because we started from the time she first started to bite, she<br/>\ndoes it less often. It took us several months for my son to unlearn the<br/>\nbehavior and relearn better behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Christy Putnam<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 06, 2006 12:40 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Biting baby<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay I am pretty sure it will just take time and patience but I have to ask<br/>\nbecause it is really getting to be an issue.  Our 14 mo. old, Aden, bites.<br/>\nNot out of frustration or lack of words that I can tell.  It is not because<br/>\nof teething either.  He does do it sometimes out of excitement but usually<br/>\nit is just him coming up (or leaning towards us when we are holding him),<br/>\nbiting then laughing.  This is not a new thing, he has done it most of his<br/>\nlife...since he figured out biting.  The biting is getting more frequent and<br/>\nharder.  Of course at first it was kinda cute because he had no teeth but<br/>\nnow he is leaving bruises and teeth marks.  He also even bites himself on<br/>\nhis arms/back of hands and laughs (leaving teeth marks then too).  So he<br/>\nthinks it is funny to bite and be bit.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have always shown a sad face and told him that it hurts when he bites.<br/>\nWe say, &quot;Ouch that hurts when you bite, its better to kiss&quot; then give him a<br/>\nbig kiss or something similar to that.  Of course, now that it hurts pretty<br/>\nbad, the automatic reaction is to be startled and gasp before proceeding but<br/>\nit never matters either way he still laughs (so he is not laughing because<br/>\nof the startle reaction).

Or at least work her jaws, and she enjoyed the feeling of biting.  <br/>\nWe actually bought and made teething toys for her at 18 mo.  She is 5 now, and still is into <br/>\nthe chewing hard thing, our DR recommended gum and twizzlers.  We really don&#39;t do those <br/>\nbut there are some alternatives.  She loves dried mango and dried papaya, they seem to <br/>\nsatisfy the chewing/biting need.  Although she sometimes chomps on straws, and all our <br/>\nsippy cups are chewed.  Hope this helps, she did stop biting people when we introduced the <br/>\nalternatives, but it took a while.
