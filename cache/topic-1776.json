She&#39;s living on her own, (has been since 15 1/2 --<br/>\nher choice -- very long story), setting up her own household  and<br/>\n&quot;nesting&quot; in preparation for the imminent birth of my grandbaby.    <br/>\n<br/>\nDuring her childhood there were a few shortlived attempts to use<br/>\nvarious (gently) coercive methods to encourage helpfulness around the<br/>\nhouse, but overall it was not required.  Her bedroom and our playroom,<br/>\nfrom toddlerhood til the minute she left, were ALWAYS topsy-turvy with<br/>\ntoys, art supplies, clothes, costumes, game pieces, science<br/>\nexperiments and more clothes, with the exception of about one day,<br/>\nabout twice a year, when I would wade into the maelstrom to sort and<br/>\norganize as best I could.  Would she have preferred it neat and<br/>\nwell-organized?  I imagine so:  she usually expressed great<br/>\nappreciation and admiration when her room was &quot;done.&quot;  Would she make<br/>\nthe least bit of effort to keep it that way?  Not a chance:  there was<br/>\nfar too much creative energy to burn and far too many fun and<br/>\ninteresting activities to engage in to be bothered taking the few<br/>\nseconds to put away a toy in its &quot;proper&quot; place, or a dirty sock in<br/>\nthe hamper.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow - her apartment is spotless.  Her housekeeping and cleanliness<br/>\nstandards are far, far, far higher than mine have ever been.  It&#39;s HER<br/>\nplace and she wants it nice so she does the work to keep it that way.<br/>\n I imagine her standard will change a bit as her family grows, but<br/>\nmaybe not.  Either way, SHE is the one responsible for HER choices,<br/>\nwhich was always the most important issue for her -- and, eventually,<br/>\nfor me, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s important for<br/>\n&gt;their room to be safe and toys EVERYWHERE isn&#39;t really safe for a 1<br/>\n </span></blockquote>yr old.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering what&#39;s unsafe about it.  If she&#39;s crawling then she&#39;s<br/>\nnot going to trip on anything; if she&#39;s walking she&#39;s not likely to go<br/>\nmore than a couple steps without stopping to play with something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy ds loved to make a nest out of the toybox, too.  The toys were<br/>\nalmost always dumped in a corner - or rather, dumped in the middle of<br/>\nthe room then pushed into the corner. :)  If I were worried about the<br/>\nmess being dangerous, I&#39;d probably put a &quot;baby&quot; fence/gate around the<br/>\npile of toys, leaving them visible and accessible, and easily tossed<br/>\n&quot;away&quot; during pick-ups.  Limit the freedom of the mess, rather than of<br/>\nthe children.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDS as a 16 yr old:  messy room, too busy with various jobs and sports<br/>\nactivities to keep it up.  It&#39;s conveniently located out of public<br/>\nview, in a far corner of the basement - he likes it that way:  very<br/>\nprivate.  Prefers that no one enter, not even his parents, though I do<br/>\ntake a peek now and then to keep an eye on things.  Does his own<br/>\nlaundry when he needs it, keeps up with emptying the dehumidifier cuz<br/>\nif he doesn&#39;t he gets mold in his room.  Does this and that when I ask<br/>\nhim to, especially heavy lifting (he&#39;s 5&#39;11&quot; and 180 pounds), and even<br/>\noccasionally takes out the trash without being asked.  I&#39;m ALWAYS<br/>\ngetting comments from other people regarding his helpfulness towards<br/>\npeople other than his family.  I have no idea what his housekeeping<br/>\nstandards will be like when he&#39;s on his own.

It did with mine.  My mom was never <br/>\nmuch of a housekeeper and my dad wasn&#39;t much of a husband.  They fought <br/>\na LOT.  Lots of arguments and physical fights.  My mom would get so <br/>\ncrazy about us making messes because she was the one that was going to <br/>\nget yelled at when my dad came home from work.  That really sucked for <br/>\nus as kids and that sucked for her to have to deal with.  They <br/>\ndivorced.  They both remarried and they&#39;re the same though the spouses <br/>\nhave changed.  Luckily for my mom she didn&#39;t marry a man who cares <br/>\nabout a spotless home.  Unluckily for my stepmom she then had to deal <br/>\nwith a drill sergeant for a husband.  They divorced also.  Twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH doesn&#39;t give a hoot about a sparkling house.  It&#39;s very low on <br/>\nhis list of priorities.  I used to apologize (good grief!) for the <br/>\nhouse being a wreck when he came home from work because I was busy <br/>\nbeing a Mama to our two little ones (20 months apart).  He would laugh <br/>\nand shake his head and say, &quot;but THAT is what your supposed to be <br/>\ndoing....we didn&#39;t have kids so that you could stay home and be Martha <br/>\nStewart!&quot;  Oh yeah.  Duh.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternately, your DS may not grow up to be a slob.  Maybe he&#39;ll be a <br/>\nguy that actually puts his socks in the hamper and makes a meal for his <br/>\nfamily.

So I usually clean their rooms for them when <br/>\n  they&#39;re younger, and with them as they learn to join in.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Let&#39;s see....<br/>\n  My 14 y.o. goes through phases of mess, but he loves organization. <br/>\n  For the last several years, he&#39;ll keep his room at a certain clean <br/>\n  level most of the time. If it gets messy, he&#39;ll eventually go into a <br/>\n  deep clean phase and gut the room, ending up with perfection. <br/>\n  He rarely even asks for help anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jared (almost 11) likes neat, but hates to clean at ALL. It&#39;s just <br/>\n  not something he enjoys at this point. Yet he doesn&#39;t make much <br/>\n  mess. He&#39;s my artistic dreamer and just prefers being in his own <br/>\n  world....other activities (other than Yu-gi-oh, drawing or gaming) <br/>\n  are a distraction for him. I clean his room for him and it stays <br/>\n  pretty nice. He&#39;s a low maintenance kinda guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sierra (7) is totally, utterly messy. I can clean her room and in <br/>\n  two hours it looks like a storm hit. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t care, <br/>\n  she&#39;s just a very busy, interesting person and NEEDS lots of stuff <br/>\n  out. She loves having me clean her room, is very grateful and tries <br/>\n  to pick up to the best of her ability. I was a lot like her, and I <br/>\n  figured out how to be halfway organized in life anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jalen is my toddler....he doesn&#39;t care if everything is out or <br/>\n  picked up (actually, he might prefer everything out) we all clean up <br/>\n  after him. It&#39;s intersting, because he&#39;ll come out when I&#39;m sitting <br/>\n  on the couch and take a dirty plate or bowl from me and deliver it <br/>\n  to the kitchen. He makes a LOT of mess...but he&#39;s also learning by <br/>\n  example, to do things for other people. When he dumps something on <br/>\n  the floor, I&#39;ll start cleaning up and say &quot;Jalen, could you help <br/>\n  me?&quot; Sometimes he&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot;, sometimes he&#39;ll pitch in....I don&#39;t <br/>\n  make him feel badly if &quot;no&quot; is the answer. I just do it and <br/>\n  say &quot;well, I don&#39;t want to step on yucky food, so I&#39;m going to sweep <br/>\n  this up, could you please put it in the garbage next time?&quot;<br/>\n  Usually he&#39;ll nod vaguely, like the thought simply hadn&#39;t occurred <br/>\n  to him.:) <br/>\n  I think there is a lot of high expectations of these little people.<br/>\n  Their barely past the baby stage, but they&#39;re supposed to understand <br/>\n  about cleaning up after themselves? I think that&#39;s setting parents <br/>\n  up for a lot of frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

Surround the child with lots of<br/>\n&gt; reasons to read, great materials, and they do<br/>\n&gt; eventually.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the mother is running around picking up, feeling<br/>\n&gt; like a slave and not saying anything, that&#39;s not the<br/>\n&gt; balance we&#39;re talking about either.<br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s hugely our job to change our attitudes<br/>\n&gt; about clean up...WE chose to have children, WE chose<br/>\n&gt; the work that goes with it, WE should choose to be<br/>\n&gt; joyful and thankful.<br/>\n&gt; Every time I get weary, I just thank the universe<br/>\n&gt; for the mess that is only here because my loved ones<br/>\n&gt; are. Believe me, I&#39;d LOVE to clean up after my Mom<br/>\n&gt; today...she&#39;s gone and I will never clean up after<br/>\n&gt; her again. I&#39;d give anything to fold her laundry, or<br/>\n&gt; brush her hair, or help her shower.....it would mean<br/>\n&gt; she was still with me.<br/>\n&gt; I remember that as I pick up a child&#39;s shoes. How<br/>\n&gt; very sweet these reminders are, that we have<br/>\n&gt; children and they are in our homes, happy and<br/>\n&gt; healthy!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I do let my kids know when I&#39;m overwhelmed, I DO let<br/>\n&gt; them know I want things to find their way to the<br/>\n&gt; garbage. I also ask for their input in what would<br/>\n&gt; help them, help ME.:)<br/>\n&gt; Most of the time, if I&#39;m happily doing something, I<br/>\n&gt; have at least one person want to join in. The key<br/>\n&gt; here, is children join in to any activity that looks<br/>\n&gt; fun...they&#39;re smart to avoid the ones you seem<br/>\n&gt; stressed or resentful about!  Would YOU want to join<br/>\n&gt; an adult that seemed to hate what they were doing? I<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joy is contagious. If we spread true joy, then the<br/>\n&gt; unschooling/chores etc.... all fall into place. The<br/>\n&gt; focus is our relationships, the focus is being<br/>\n&gt; happy, all else will resolve itself with joy as our<br/>\n&gt; guide.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Ren<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Learn about unschooling at:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>\n&gt;                  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nRead only the mail you want - Yahoo!

They need Mama and/or Daddy<br/>\ndown on the floor doing most of the clean up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to relate my own experience as a teen here.<br/>\nI am still a lot like my teen self as far as &quot;stuff&quot; goes.:) I don&#39;t <br/>\nlike putting something back when I&#39;m done with it. If I need it <br/>\nagain in a minute, it&#39;s much more convenient if it&#39;s still out. It&#39;s <br/>\ntaken a huge amount of self discipline, to be able to NOT always do <br/>\nthat.<br/>\nAs a teen (and even after moving out on my own) I just didn&#39;t care. <br/>\nIf I was done with something, it went on the floor. My room had <br/>\nstuff strewn from wall to wall, usually a small path to my bed! <br/>\nFunny thing is, I function much better when things are semi-<br/>\norganized, so it felt overwhelming after a while, but I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nBEGIN to think about how to even start.<br/>\nMy Mom never helped me. She nagged occasionally about cleaning up, <br/>\nbut my solution? Call Grandma! My Grandma was the queen of <br/>\norganization, she loved feeling needed (and she WAS needed) so I <br/>\nwould call her to come have a cleaning day with me. I loved it when <br/>\nshe helped me clean my room. She would take that overwhelming task, <br/>\nand break it into baby steps, giving me one simple job at a time, <br/>\nwhile she did something else.<br/>\nOh how I loved my room when we were done. We had a nice day of it, <br/>\ngood conversation and a clean room to top it all off. Had my Mom <br/>\nonly understood that she could be my partner, she could be a lovely <br/>\nassistant, and I would have enjoyed bonding time while cleaning, <br/>\ninstead of building resentment.....it would have been SO much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoms out there that expect toddlers to pick up after themselves, <br/>\nforget about it. Would you rather spend their toddlerhood nagging, <br/>\nand trying to achieve something unnatural, or just enjoying them? It <br/>\npasses SO quickly, take it from someone with a child getting close <br/>\nto adult age, the toddler phase is over with in the blink of an eye, <br/>\nand you never, ever get it back.<br/>\nYou will be saying goodby to that cute, chubby toddler soon. You <br/>\nwill say goodbye to that sweet 6 year old. And on it goes.....spend <br/>\nyour time enjoying every moment, forget about cleaning, it really <br/>\nisn&#39;t important. Hire a maid if you have to, just enjoy your babies <br/>\nwhile their little. Heck, same thing applies for teens.

So I usually clean their rooms for them when <br/>\nthey&#39;re younger, and with them as they learn to join in.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s see....<br/>\nMy 14 y.o. goes through phases of mess, but he loves organization. <br/>\nFor the last several years, he&#39;ll keep his room at a certain clean <br/>\nlevel most of the time. If it gets messy, he&#39;ll eventually go into a <br/>\ndeep clean phase and gut the room, ending up with perfection. <br/>\nHe rarely even asks for help anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJared (almost 11) likes neat, but hates to clean at ALL. It&#39;s just <br/>\nnot something he enjoys at this point. Yet he doesn&#39;t make much <br/>\nmess. He&#39;s my artistic dreamer and just prefers being in his own <br/>\nworld....other activities (other than Yu-gi-oh, drawing or gaming) <br/>\nare a distraction for him. I clean his room for him and it stays <br/>\npretty nice. He&#39;s a low maintenance kinda guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra (7) is totally, utterly messy. I can clean her room and in <br/>\ntwo hours it looks like a storm hit. It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t care, <br/>\nshe&#39;s just a very busy, interesting person and NEEDS lots of stuff <br/>\nout. She loves having me clean her room, is very grateful and tries <br/>\nto pick up to the best of her ability. I was a lot like her, and I <br/>\nfigured out how to be halfway organized in life anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen is my toddler....he doesn&#39;t care if everything is out or <br/>\npicked up (actually, he might prefer everything out) we all clean up <br/>\nafter him. It&#39;s intersting, because he&#39;ll come out when I&#39;m sitting <br/>\non the couch and take a dirty plate or bowl from me and deliver it <br/>\nto the kitchen. He makes a LOT of mess...but he&#39;s also learning by <br/>\nexample, to do things for other people. When he dumps something on <br/>\nthe floor, I&#39;ll start cleaning up and say &quot;Jalen, could you help <br/>\nme?&quot; Sometimes he&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot;, sometimes he&#39;ll pitch in....I don&#39;t <br/>\nmake him feel badly if &quot;no&quot; is the answer. I just do it and <br/>\nsay &quot;well, I don&#39;t want to step on yucky food, so I&#39;m going to sweep <br/>\nthis up, could you please put it in the garbage next time?&quot;<br/>\nUsually he&#39;ll nod vaguely, like the thought simply hadn&#39;t occurred <br/>\nto him.:) <br/>\nI think there is a lot of high expectations of these little people.<br/>\nTheir barely past the baby stage, but they&#39;re supposed to understand <br/>\nabout cleaning up after themselves?

My request has always been that he help out a little and mostly just be there to see that after we make a huge mess, we all pick up together.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big issue now, I understand that it&#39;s all very normal and that I am the one who likes things picked up.  I was however saying that I do have a problem with this if he is a teenager.  By that I mean, I&#39;m willing to trust him and go with it for now but I don&#39;t think I could be so patient when he is a teen.  That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m asking the more experienced moms here if their teens are still making messes and expecting to be guided and helped like a toddler.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Echo is going to just be a kid and dump toys all over - this is still dangerous for Kobe and they do share a room - would anyone suggest that I just keep her out of there and let him play alone?  I am a personal chef and I work from home...there are times when my kids have to play without me there to guide them...at all times, I can still see them most of the time.  It&#39;s important for their room to be safe and toys EVERYWHERE isn&#39;t really safe for a 1 yr old.  I have (this week) gated the bedroom so that Echo could play whatever however and Kobe can just play in the livingroom with us.  Echo enjoys the privacy and is fine with it - has even cried when I let her back in to play.  Though this works for Echo and I, Kobes gets so pissed and her feelings are so hurt but I can&#39;t afford to let my food burn!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s a sage mama?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) He&#39;s &quot;winning&quot;???????  When did your parent-child relationship turn <br/>\ninto a pissing match?  Seriously.  That&#39;s not going to help you two <br/>\nhave a loving, trusting relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if you were joking about that or not but my son and I have never had &quot;pissing matches,&quot; nor am I resentful...at all, he&#39;s 3.5!!!  I understand that he is behaving normally...I expect him to get into things and dump his things as he learns and plays BUT he&#39;s young.  I don&#39;t expect an older child to be so careless.  I suppose that&#39;s the main reason I asked for any feedback at all.  I uses the word &quot;winning&quot; meaning that things are not going MY way.  Ideally, he would want to pitch in without being asked several times. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also heard Dr Phil ask &quot;how&#39;s that working for ya&quot; and I put some deep thought into that this morning.  He/you are right, asking him to help is not getting any results.  The fact is, Echo does not care about cleaning up, though he does help out at times.  So, if I just leave it alone, clean up myself, who is he going to be when he grows up?  If he were in his 20s today, he would be considered a slob.  Again, moms with older kids...gimmie your .02.<br/>\n<br/>\nEcho is with his gma now, tomorrow he will come home to a clean room, and he can make a mess of it if he likes.  I will continue to clean up at the end of the day and I know he will help a little.  I think my fear is that he will grow up, get married and fight with his wife because her expects her to do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTracy, I know we don&#39;t really know eachother and sometimes tones of voice and such can be lost in email but I have to admit, I&#39;m a bit offended that anyone here or elsewhere would think I would be crazy enough to have a pissing match with my young son.  I just want what&#39;s BEST for him.  I am here for support and knowledge, not to be criticized or labeled resentful.  I feel that you&#39;ve misjudged me.  I still appreciate your input and I have found it helpful.

I want to support my childs interest, whatever that may<br/>\nbe, without question, right?  Shouldn&#39;t we then support my husbands interest<br/>\nin farming.  Why is it not o.k. to say to our children, yes this is dads<br/>\ninterest lets support him in it?  Dad&#39;s interest may bring extra flies in to<br/>\nthe house or smell bad or make it so we can never go on vacation, but it&#39;s<br/>\nwhat he loves to do. I think a little sacrifice for the ones you love is not<br/>\na terrible thing.(a good example of this would be when my 5 year old wanted<br/>\nto inspect large spiders up close with an extremely irrational arachnophobic<br/>\nmom.  I did it, but it hurt.8^))  To be clear, we don&#39;t force chores on<br/>\nanyone.  My husband takes care of everything in regards to farming, not the<br/>\nkids.  We don&#39;t expect them to do chores unless they have a pet that they<br/>\nspecifically purchased.  We also don&#39;t have disposable pets here that you<br/>\ncan just throw away when you get tired of them.  If my kids no longer want<br/>\nto take care of a pet it is their responsibility to find a good home for it.<br/>\n   Every animal on our farm is free range, so there is very little work that<br/>\nneeds to be done anyway.  We get opportunities that most city dwellers<br/>\nrarely get to see on an ongoing basis.  We have learned so much, being on a<br/>\nfarm.  The kids seem to love it around the animals, but with everything good<br/>\nalso comes certain responsibilities especially when you consider living<br/>\nbreathing things.<br/>\n    I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that it offends me when you say it&#39;s<br/>\nnot fair to ask kids to pitch in on farm work when all it is doing, if done<br/>\nwell, is asking them to support their dad in a hobby that he loves.  I must<br/>\nstress that we have a very small farm, I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to have a<br/>\nfarm that needs a major amount of tending to. No they didn&#39;t chose the farm<br/>\nand that&#39;s why we don&#39;t require them to do chores, but sometimes needing<br/>\ntheir help is unavoidable (herding animals back in when they&#39;ve escaped).<br/>\nLuckily, so far they love it and I hope it remains that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnmarie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Ren [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, July 11, 2004 9:59 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;slave&quot; labor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I just lost the quote I was going to use...darnit!

It didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him responsibility, it taught him<br/>\nresentment. He HATES farms to this day. Other personality types would grow<br/>\nup to be farmers themselves, but the lesson of forced chores lives on in<br/>\nresentment, not responsibility.<br/>\n  Responsibility is learned in it&#39;s own way and time, like all else. Not in<br/>\na vacuum....in a rich environment in which a person has OPPORTUNITIES to be<br/>\nresponsible, but it&#39;s not forced.<br/>\n  Just like reading. Surround the child with lots of reasons to read, great<br/>\nmaterials, and they do eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If the mother is running around picking up, feeling like a slave and not<br/>\nsaying anything, that&#39;s not the balance we&#39;re talking about either.<br/>\n  I think it&#39;s hugely our job to change our attitudes about clean up...WE<br/>\nchose to have children, WE chose the work that goes with it, WE should<br/>\nchoose to be joyful and thankful.<br/>\n  Every time I get weary, I just thank the universe for the mess that is<br/>\nonly here because my loved ones are. Believe me, I&#39;d LOVE to clean up after<br/>\nmy Mom today...she&#39;s gone and I will never clean up after her again. I&#39;d<br/>\ngive anything to fold her laundry, or brush her hair, or help her<br/>\nshower.....it would mean she was still with me.<br/>\n  I remember that as I pick up a child&#39;s shoes. How very sweet these<br/>\nreminders are, that we have children and they are in our homes, happy and<br/>\nhealthy!<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do let my kids know when I&#39;m overwhelmed, I DO let them know I want<br/>\nthings to find their way to the garbage. I also ask for their input in what<br/>\nwould help them, help ME.:)<br/>\n  Most of the time, if I&#39;m happily doing something, I have at least one<br/>\nperson want to join in. The key here, is children join in to any activity<br/>\nthat looks fun...they&#39;re smart to avoid the ones you seem stressed or<br/>\nresentful about!  Would YOU want to join an adult that seemed to hate what<br/>\nthey were doing? I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Joy is contagious. If we spread true joy, then the unschooling/chores<br/>\netc.... all fall into place. The focus is our relationships, the focus is<br/>\nbeing happy, all else will resolve itself with joy as our guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Learn about unschooling at:<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

LOL  My DS went through a big &quot;dump and <br/>\ndash&quot; stage between the ages of 2 to 4.  Now at 5 he doesn&#39;t do it that <br/>\noften anymore, but it still happens occasionally.  My DD is the same <br/>\nage as your Echo and we&#39;re in the thick of her dumping escapades.  <br/>\nhehehe  She likes to dump out bins and pretend to be in a boat, or a <br/>\nbed, or put stuffed animals in them and pretend she has to &quot;rescue&quot; <br/>\nthem because somebody mean trapped them, etc.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, think that the &quot;dump and dash&quot; phase is totally normal <br/>\nfor their development and liken it to an older baby continually <br/>\ndropping food or toys from up in their high chair.  They&#39;re conducting <br/>\nexperiments and IMO they like to watch and hear the avalanche of Legos <br/>\nor blocks or Hot Wheels or whatever is being dumped.<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t there a sound that you think it pretty cool for no apparent <br/>\nreason?  I *love* to hear a glass jar of spaghetti sauce hit the <br/>\ngrocery store floor.  Don&#39;t ask why!  LOL  I think it just sounds <br/>\nreally cool and whenever I happen to witness Mr. or Ms. Butterfingers <br/>\ndrop one in the store I rejoice!   My DH thinks it&#39;s hilarious that I <br/>\ncan get such pleasure out of something so silly, but, hey, I&#39;m easily <br/>\namused.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEcho is your first child, right?  I was way more uptight about <br/>\ndump-and-dash when he was newly doing it.  It&#39;s now &quot;old hat&quot; for DD so <br/>\nI don&#39;t get exasperated or angry that they&#39;re &quot;making work&quot; for me.  <br/>\nEven though I&#39;m not bitching and moaning about it to her (like I had <br/>\ninitially done to poor DS) she doesn&#39;t do it MORE.  Griping at DS <br/>\ndidn&#39;t make him stop doing it and NOT griping at DD hasn&#39;t caused her <br/>\nto do it more.  I hope that makes sense.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint being....it&#39;s totally normal for your DS to do this.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nlast forever and you&#39;ll be able to chuckle and &quot;remember when...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What would you gentle mothers do about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nuttin&#39;, Honey.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So far, I&#39;ve asked him to help pick up at the end of the day and then <br/>\n&gt; we start over with the mess in the AM.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As Dr. Phil says, &quot;And how&#39;s that workin&#39; for ya?&quot;  Seriously, that&#39;s <br/>\nnot going to work without guilt, coercion and tears so don&#39;t try that <br/>\none anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; HOw can I explain to him that he can do that but he needs to help pick <br/>\n&gt; up at the end of the day, so far it;s a big struggle and he is <br/>\n&gt; &quot;winning&quot; by simply ignoring me.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Eww, two issues here.  Well, 3 actually.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) He &quot;needs&quot; to help?  He doesn&#39;t *really* NEED to help.  You *want* <br/>\nhim to help.  Semantics does play a part in our thought process.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge difference between need and want.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Picking up at the end of the day probably isn&#39;t the more opportune <br/>\ntime to suggest a clean up session.  You&#39;re tired, he&#39;s tired, the baby <br/>\nis tired.  Prime time for low reserves on patience for all involved.  <br/>\nWhy not &quot;start fresh&quot; in the morning when the kids are maybe both still <br/>\nsleeping or after breakfast or whatever.  I really suggest not trying <br/>\nto tackle a big pile of toys at the end of the day.  I know I&#39;m pretty <br/>\ncranky toward the end of the day and little things can trigger Bitchy <br/>\nMommy to emerge.  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n3) He&#39;s &quot;winning&quot;???????

I found one of her articles at Natural Child Project <br/>\nthat I think you might like to read.  It&#39;s called &quot;Surviving the <br/>\nToddler Years&quot;.  It really helped me to enjoy my little ones.  :)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalchild.org/naomi_aldort/toddler.html\">http://www.naturalchild.org/naomi_aldort/toddler.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; At this point I&#39;m not at all resentful...in 13 years, we&#39;re gonna have <br/>\n&gt; trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ooo, more negative thoughts.  Having that kind of &quot;fatalistic&quot; outlook <br/>\nis the surest way to make it come true.  And, sweetie, to me you DO <br/>\nsound resentful right now.  Have you ever read _Raising Your Spirited <br/>\nChild_ by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka?  There&#39;s a good deal of thought on how <br/>\nthe phrases we use to think about or talk about our children plays a <br/>\nHUGE part of how we respond to them.  For example, use &quot;assertive&quot; <br/>\ninstead of &quot;stubborn&quot;; &quot;dramatic&quot; instead of &quot;obnoxious&quot;, &quot;charismatic&quot; <br/>\ninstead of &quot;manipulative&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a snippet of the book:<br/>\n<br/>\n      &quot;Unknowingly, unwittingly, we can create labels for our spirited <br/>\nchildren that highlight the yucky stuff and hide the neat stuff.  <br/>\nLabels that embarrass us, their parents, and make us feel lousy.<br/>\n      Starting today, you can choose to stop using words that project a <br/>\nnegative image of your child.  It really isn&#39;t that far a leap from <br/>\n&#39;picky&#39; to &#39;selective&#39;, or from &#39;obnoxious&#39; to &#39;dramatic&#39;.  By merely <br/>\nchanging your vocabulary you can alter how you and others perceive your <br/>\nchild.  You can create a new image that feels good, looks good, and <br/>\nmeets socially approved standards.  The first step to enhancing your <br/>\nspirited child&#39;s strengths comes with the words you use.  It&#39;s as <br/>\nsimple as that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour library probably has this title.  If you want to buy it, Amazon <br/>\nhas it and has used copies from only $2.99.
