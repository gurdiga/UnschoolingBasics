In CA, you have <br/>\na variety of options but the one it seems most folks use (at least <br/>\nunschoolers anyhow) is to file the R4 private school affadavit. Once <br/>\nyou do that, you ARE a private school with no reporting obligations <br/>\nto the state at all. See the CHN site for details (and links to <br/>\nwhere to get the form to file, I believe the CA DoE has it online <br/>\nnow).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * Are there any gotchas or tips collected anyplace for dealing with<br/>\n&gt; the inevitable hassles?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The hassles are not &quot;inevitable&quot; when it comes to legal stuff. <br/>\nFamily and friends are a whole different thing and that all varies <br/>\ndepending on the relationship and all. If you know that there will <br/>\nbe doubting relatives, simply don&#39;t open it up for debate at <br/>\nall. &quot;It&#39;s our decision. Period.

That&#39;s the <br/>\nstatutes you would go by, I would think - that&#39;s where your kids <br/>\nwould go to school if they were going to go to school. If you get <br/>\nto &quot;pick&quot; where to call home, CA isn&#39;t bad (the R4 filing is annual <br/>\nbut not burdensome as far as I can tell) and there are other states, <br/>\nsuch as AK, CT, DC, ID, IL, IN, MI, NJ, OK, and TX that don&#39;t even <br/>\nrequire that - no notification, no testing, no portfolios, nada. <br/>\nWe&#39;re in CT and have never contacted nor been contacted by the <br/>\nschool system and DS is 8. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, closely check whichever state is &quot;home&quot; as to the compulsory <br/>\nattendance age (the age at which you are required to send the child <br/>\nto school or file paperwork) - in CA, for example, it&#39;s 6 (by a <br/>\ncertain cut off date I believe). In CT, where we are, any parent, <br/>\nwhether or not they homeschool or intend to homeschool can file a <br/>\nwaiver until their child is turning 7.

So here&#39;s<br/>\nmy re-intro:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Laureen, and I live in northern CA with my four-year old<br/>\nDS#1 Rowan, and one year old DS#2 Kestrel, and DH Jason. We&#39;ve done<br/>\nthe whole AP package; cosleeping, babywearing, EC (I see some familiar<br/>\nfaces from the EC list), yada yada yada. DH and I were committed to<br/>\nhomeschooling before we even became parents. DH was a &quot;bad boy&quot;,<br/>\nconsistently being punished by the educational system, and I was a<br/>\n&quot;good girl&quot;, consistently doing what I was told and getting &quot;rewarded&quot;<br/>\n(HA!) for that. We both feel we were poorly served by that whole<br/>\nsystem, and if a kid with all the advantages and a kid with none both<br/>\ncame out disgusted, well, then, it&#39;s not much of a stretch to<br/>\nrecognize that there&#39;s got to be a better way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to hanging out on the Continuum Concept list on and off, I became<br/>\nfamiliar with unschooling, and that just felt right. So here we are. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have many concerns with the theory, or with the actual doing.<br/>\nMy concerns are all legal/political. I don&#39;t understand how you manage<br/>\nto do this without having the law on your back. So, a bit more<br/>\nspecifically:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Is there anyplace I can go to find out what paperwork is required,<br/>\nand how to deal with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Are there any gotchas or tips collected anyplace for dealing with<br/>\nthe inevitable hassles?<br/>\n<br/>\n* My family is in the process of selling our house and moving onto a<br/>\nboat, permanently (cruising). Does anyone know of any special<br/>\nresources or information for &quot;the rules&quot; that would apply if we&#39;re in<br/>\nconstantly shifting political status?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Has anyone here successfully unschooled while aboard?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m probably being a bit of a pawlicker here. Part of my concern with<br/>\nthe legalities is that I have been threatened by family for my<br/>\nfreakish ways before (mostly-unassisted homebirth VBAC), and I want<br/>\nall my ducks in a row. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks much for your patience if these questions have been asked a<br/>\nbazillion times before!! I know that topics on most lists go round and<br/>\nround, but for a new person, it&#39;s tough to know what search terms to<br/>\nuse in poking around the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~L!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15992,"nextTopicId":15997}}
