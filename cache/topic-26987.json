I&#39;m going to<br/>\nenvision myself popping my head with a newspaper now, when I screw up.<br/>\nNot because I&#39;ll be trying, but I think that visual is going to stick<br/>\nwith me! Too funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child with autism, depending on the severity, probably should not be<br/>\nleft alone! Jalen would be considered &quot;on the spectrum&quot; though I have<br/>\nno idea exactly where or what the exact diagnoses would be since we&#39;ve<br/>\nnever had him diagnosed. Very mild in his case. Though I can relate to<br/>\nthe feelings of exasperation and complete incompetency.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve sat on the floor crying and thinking &quot;I am NOT the best parent<br/>\nfor this child&quot; because his issues just put me over the edge sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings have gotten SO much better in the last six months. Most of our<br/>\nclose friends have noticed a huge change. So I wonder if some of the<br/>\n&quot;autism&quot; symptoms seem to disappear in time, in a supportive<br/>\nenvironment where the child is allowed to develop in their own time. I<br/>\nthink he would have been diagnosed, but maybe they&#39;d have been wrong<br/>\nbecause he is just developing slower in some areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a child with true autism, or more severe autism, I really don&#39;t<br/>\nsee how you could leave them alone. I know that must be exhausting,<br/>\nbut that IS the reality of where that child is at the moment. I think<br/>\ngathering more tools and making the home more of an environment the<br/>\nchild needs is much better than trying to control constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did the OP mean by &quot;self-directed&quot; anyway?  Were you leaving her<br/>\nto her own devices in spite of the fact that she might need constant<br/>\nsupervision? That isn&#39;t &quot;self-directed&quot;, that is avoidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child like her might need a LOT of one-on-one and guidance. Rather<br/>\nthan leaving her to figure it out for herself, be PRESENT and follow<br/>\nher lead as to what sound interesting. Try to find a positive outlet<br/>\nfor whatever need she has at the moment, even if it seems<br/>\n&quot;destructive&quot;. Destruction is part of creativity too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntroduce fun ideas and trust her to pick and choose. Don&#39;t leave her<br/>\non her own though, if she can&#39;t handle that at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have my sympathy. It&#39;s really hard for me to maintain my calm with<br/>\nJalen at times and he is so mild compared to many children I read<br/>\nabout here and at other lists.

Depending upon who you ask, behavior is communication, stimulus<br/>\nresponse or both.  I believe it&#39;s both.  Was she having a hard day?  Did she<br/>\nneed to have more of your attention?  (For some people, negative attention<br/>\nis better than no attention.)  How verbal is she?  Where on the autism<br/>\nspectrum is she anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t say where you were when these things were taking place.  Since I<br/>\ntrain dogs for a living I&#39;ll add this little bit of advice.  A lot of my<br/>\nclients complain to me that the dog eats off the counters, or pees in the<br/>\nhouse, or chews the furniture.  I tell them to keep a rolled up newspaper<br/>\naround to hit *themselves* over the head when the dog does something wrong.<br/>\nBecause the OWNER is the one that left the dog alone and unsupervised.  You<br/>\ncan leave an old dog who has no such issues alone, but if you know your dog<br/>\nis a counter-surfer and you leave it alone to take a shower and come back to<br/>\nfind all the cupcakes you left on the counter gone, how can you blame the<br/>\ndog?  It&#39;s your fault....you knew this is the dog&#39;s behavior pattern and you<br/>\nset him up to do this.  It&#39;s not fair to blame the dog.  Although it is<br/>\nfrustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo back to this...what was your daughter trying to tell you with her<br/>\nbehavior?  Was it &quot;what happens when I do this?&quot;  Was it &quot;what kind of drama<br/>\nreward will I get from mom?&quot;  Was it &quot;I&#39;m bored and need stimulation and<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to get it any other way?&quot;  Were this my child and I needed to<br/>\nget some stuff done, like an on-line class, I think I&#39;d get a hold of one of<br/>\nthose small indoor trampolines and put it in the room with me, put on some<br/>\nmusic and let her bounce.  I would be there to be with her, but also able to<br/>\ndo what I need to get done.  Or she&#39;s 14, put her in a bathing suit and put<br/>\nher in the bathtub with a big amount of cheap lotion and let her do<br/>\nwhatever.  Or give her some shower gel and a bath poof and let her &quot;paint&quot;<br/>\nthe walls.  It can be washed off later.  But I don&#39;t think she can be left<br/>\nalone, unsupervised.  This is the crux of your problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery often, problem solving requires us to let go of what we think the<br/>\nmotivations of others are and really look at the situation.  This can be<br/>\nvery hard when you are stressed and stretched thin.  I think you need to<br/>\nfind some respite care so you can get some time to recharge and then you can<br/>\nbe more fully available to her.  But also, get that book I posted about<br/>\nearlier in this thread.  Additionally maybe you could provide some serious<br/>\nbody movement, like a long walk with her in the mornings so that she gets<br/>\nsome movement and burns off some of the energy.  If she&#39;s in a constant<br/>\nstate of &quot;cabin fever&quot; that&#39;s going to make her frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you luck but I do think there is an answer out there, you are just<br/>\ngoing to have to look for it in different places than you have so far.<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/9/07, Deb Gibson &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dlgibson@...\">dlgibson@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   My daughter also requires loads of movement (sensory input).
