That, and the dentist, are trigger issues for me because of real life <br/>\nexperiences that were terrifying, and led to sadly unpleasant long term strife.  <br/>\nWhen I reread my post today, I was surprised at how angry and fearful it <br/>\nsounded.  I know that I am angry and fearful and depressed, but I was surprised that <br/>\nit leaked so heavily into my post! I am stuck in a loop of &#39;avoiding agony&#39;, <br/>\nso a logical philosophical question turned into a diatribe on life and death <br/>\nextremes.  Sorry, for bringing my baggage along here.<br/>\nAs Shannon, who is rather new to unschooling, was asking about the <br/>\ntemperament and habits of other unschooling parents on safety topics, somehow my demons <br/>\nwere unleashed.  <br/>\nI was not suggesting that anyone force or coerce a child to do anything, but <br/>\nthat the adults set the standard and must figure how to make it work, and not <br/>\ndrive until it is safe as can be, within our power. So I was agreeing with <br/>\nShannon&#39;s perspective.  It was the other mom&#39;s complaint, arguing to let her kid <br/>\nbe unbuckled while in someone else&#39;s car, that really set me off. [And what <br/>\nwould any of us seatbelt advocates do, if instead, the other mom had been the <br/>\ndriver?  If we were riding with a family who, we discovered on the spot, did not <br/>\nbuckle in? It is their car and their choice.  I would still ride along that <br/>\none time, buckled in, without making a scene. But probably not ever again, <br/>\nwithout some discussion about it]          <br/>\nOther than a few times when my kids were infants rejecting their carseats, we <br/>\nrarely had battles over seat restraints. As infants, there was no reasoning <br/>\nconversation to be had, only the empathetic energy of mother and child. So we <br/>\nmight sit in the car nursing and listening to music, or play babygames, or take <br/>\na catnap until we could drive safely.  Several times I repositioned the <br/>\ncarseat or cover, and it seemed to help. No big deal. The buckles were as necessary <br/>\nas the key, to get the motor running.  When they were older, if there was <br/>\nresistance to getting in the car, it was about a real stuff that we tried to deal <br/>\nwith in the moment, negotiating rather than enforcing. <br/>\nFor me, as a long time unschooler, the real struggle happens when a child&#39;s <br/>\nabsolute refusal conflicts with some kind of real deadline. If that occurs once <br/>\nin a while, each situation is different and adaptable.  If it is occurring <br/>\nevery week, then IMO, it is up to the parent to get to the root reality, and to <br/>\nadjust their own schedule, or their attitude, or the overall atmosphere as <br/>\nnecessary, without relinquishing anyone&#39;s safety.<br/>\nAgain sorry for the tirade.  I usually wait overnight, and reread or edit, <br/>\nbefore posting emotional responses anywhere. <br/>\nRobin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10565,"nextTopicId":10617}}
