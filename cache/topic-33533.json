Thanks to the<br/>\ndreaded television and game sites he can read about 50 words, and is<br/>\nlearning more every day.  I suppose that I&#39;ve shorted out his brain by<br/>\nexposing him to this stuff so early.  *wink*<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be an addictive element to the bright colors and<br/>\nquick-changing pictures and that lovely sense of POWER kids can get<br/>\nwith video games.

Right now he&#39;s enjoying watching the same TV shows<br/>\nover and over and over and over.  My point is... kids often like to<br/>\nimmerse themselves in one new thing, so even if it seems like your son<br/>\nis going nuts for computer time, it&#39;s ok.

I would ask him what game he would like <br/>\nto play, he points to it, then watched as I do the game for him. I <br/>\nwould never asked him to do them. one time he said &#39;my turn&#39; and pushed <br/>\nmy hand from the mouse. and it all went from there.<br/>\nI now ask him what stie he would like, wiggles, playhouse disney,etc<br/>\nthen get it up for him and he does the rest. <br/>\ntoday he was matching numbers on honey pots to the numbers in the <br/>\npicture and it blew me away.<br/>\nI&#39;m never far away if he askes, calls out, for me. I am quite happy to <br/>\ndo it for him but thats not what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat do you all think?<br/>\nI probably am just being silly and having the steiner voices creap in <br/>\nto my mind. <br/>\nThanks for reading, sorry its so long.<br/>\nJsc</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33642,"nextTopicId":33547}}
