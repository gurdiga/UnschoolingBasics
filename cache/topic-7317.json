In<br/>\nDenver, when the boys were 3, she finagled them into a<br/>\npre-kindergarten that fed into an exclusive private school.<br/>\n<br/>\n    On the first day, Austin went in with an astronomy book. But when<br/>\nhe asked the teacher when they were going to study astronomy, she<br/>\nlooked puzzled and said, &quot;I think you study that in college.&quot; Linda<br/>\nsays Austin grabbed his brother by the hand and told the teacher,<br/>\n&quot;Thank you very much, but we&#39;re going home to study astronomy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n    ...<br/>\n<br/>\n    When the boys were 6, she read them a book on the cave art of<br/>\nLascaux. &quot;They loved it,&quot; Linda says. It started the boys&#39; fascination<br/>\nwith history. &quot;We went from there to the Hittites and the Sumerians<br/>\nand the Macedonians.&quot; From ancient history they got into military<br/>\nhistory, their current obsession.<br/>\n<br/>\n    ...<br/>\n<br/>\n    A few years ago, the boys took a reading test. &quot;They wanted to<br/>\nknow where they were,&quot; Linda says. &quot;They look at their friends in<br/>\nschool and wonder internally whether they measure up.&quot; Graded by mail,<br/>\nthe test showed they were reading at the level of college sophomores.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Linda and Dan feel their job as unschoolers is that of guides.<br/>\nWhat are the boys missing out on? Can they use a board game or outing<br/>\nto feed into one of their interests? She took them to a book signing<br/>\nwhere they got to talk to Mario Livio, author of The Golden Ratio,<br/>\nabout Fibonacci numbers. They do math by shopping for groceries or<br/>\nfiguring out the area of a room. They play Elemento, a board game<br/>\nbased on the periodic table.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &quot;My job is to put things in their path in a way that can be<br/>\nengaging,&quot; Linda says. &quot;You have to be ahead and think of<br/>\nopportunities for them. We do read the &#39;great books,&#39; but if they<br/>\naren&#39;t interested in one, I&#39;ll go get the tape and we&#39;ll listen in the<br/>\ncar.&quot; Also in the car: tapes from The Teaching Company on great<br/>\nbattles of the ancient world, the theory of evolution and comparative<br/>\nreligion. Right now they are listening to From Yao to Mao: 5,000 Years<br/>\nof Chinese History.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a wonderful description of how to approach unschooling<br/>\nin general. Way to go Glenna!<br/>\n--<br/>\nDaniel<br/>\n( Blogging at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://key-words.blogspot.com/\">http://key-words.blogspot.com/</a> )</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7314,"nextTopicId":7168}}
