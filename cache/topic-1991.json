I&#39;m reading &quot;The Underground History of American Education&quot; by John Taylor Gatto right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I began to see that schools were started to inhibit children&#39;s natural intelligence by dumbing them down, and to create a society of consumers and obedient employees who were unable/unwilling to think for themselves, unschooling is much clearer and more attractive to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nGatto is an award-winning former PS teacher, who spent 30+ years teaching and researching for this book. It&#39;s eye-opening to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nTracy A.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1972,"nextTopicId":1398}}
