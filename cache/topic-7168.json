The best is yet to come.  Also, alot of these kids have decided to march to their own drummer, they are artists and craftsmen, you don&#39;t see alot of hype about those types of people.  In a way that&#39;s good - homeschool kids can meld into society too.   Hmmm.... is that good?<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Yahoo!
