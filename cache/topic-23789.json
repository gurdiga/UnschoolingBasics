I had big plans to do mini-trips on weekly and monthly  <br/>\nschedules, and thought I&#39;d be providing lots of arts and crafts  <br/>\nprojects, writing letters, learning phonics, etc with him.  Two  <br/>\nproblems:  Owen never wants to go anywhere and he hates worksheets  <br/>\nand arts and crafts--anything schooly.  I noticed he was learning  <br/>\nlots from play, watching tv, reading with me and just asking  <br/>\nquestions--the way he&#39;s always learned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been toying with the idea of unschooling for several weeks, but  <br/>\nsigned him up for a co-op preschool anyway for this fall.  But  <br/>\nyesterday I was informed that the preschool was closing.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nthinking &quot;this must be a sign!&quot;  So I&#39;m keeping my eyes out, ready to  <br/>\nfollow his lead.  I am just getting frustrated that I have such a  <br/>\nrough time getting him out the door to do basic things like visiting  <br/>\nthe library or to playgroup, though he invariably has a great time  <br/>\nonce we get there.  Being pregnant I tend to not feel like going  <br/>\nanywhere either, so a lot of times I just lay off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWish us luck on our continued unschooling journey.  I&#39;m glad to be  <br/>\nhere and look forward to learning from the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Erin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23616,"nextTopicId":23747}}
