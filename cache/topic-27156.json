Specifically, we&#39;re looking for moms and dads who strongly believe in parenting �outside the box.� Please feel free to forward this email on to anyone you think would be interested in taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you are unfamiliar with the show, the premise of Wife Swap is to take two different families and have the moms switch places to experience how another family lives. Half of the week, mom lives the life of the family she is staying with. Then she introduces a &quot;rule change&quot; where she implements rules and activities that her family has. It&#39;s a positive experience for people to not only learn but teach about other families and other ways of life. Wife Swap airs on Disney owned ABC television on Mondays at 8 pm- the family hour!<br/>\n<br/>\nRequirements: Each family must consist of two parents and at least one child between 7 and 17 and should reside in the continental U.S. (There may be other children living in the home who are older or younger than the required age�as long as one child is in the required age range.)<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipating in the show is a very unique experience that can be life changing for everyone. In addition, each family that tapes an episode of Wife Swap receives $20,000 as compensation for their time.

I&#39;m a Casting Producer for ABC&#39;s Primetime show, &quot;Wife Swap.&quot; I hope you don&#39;t mind me contacting you, but we&#39;re gearing up for a fourth season at the moment and we&#39;re currently looking for one-of-a-kind families with plenty of personality! Specifically, we&#39;re looking for moms and dads who strongly believe in parenting outside the box. Please feel free to forward this email on to anyone you think would be interested in taking part in this once-in-a-lifetime experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case you are unfamiliar with the show, the premise of Wife Swap is to take two different families and have the moms switch places to experience how another family lives. Half of the week, mom lives the life of the family she is staying with. Then she introduces a &quot;rule change&quot; where she implements rules and activities that her family has. It&#39;s a positive experience for people to not only learn but teach about other families and other ways of life. Wife Swap airs on Disney owned ABC television on Mondays at 8 pm- the family hour!<br/>\n<br/>\nRequirements: Each family must consist of two parents and at least one child between 7 and 17 and should reside in the continental U.S. (There may be other children living in the home who are older or younger than the required ageas long as one child is in the required age range.)<br/>\n<br/>\nParticipating in the show is a very unique experience that can be life changing for everyone.
