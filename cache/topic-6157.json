My resources at the the time was oldest was approaching school age were books, alternative publications, and likeminded people I met through parenting/homeschooling groups.

As Angela pointed out, we have more access to new ideas, examples and support from other parents thru the internet.  We&#39;re able to get info that wouldn&#39;t have been available in the 70&#39;s (or even the late 80&#39;s, having a been a young mom then myself).  Our mothers learned from their mothers, and from society at large.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s also easy for me to forget that I have so much more power than my Mom ever had.  I have legal rights she didn&#39;t have, more insight into people and situations.  I was able to easily get a divorce when my first marriage sucked, she wasn&#39;t able to get out for 20 years.  During my early days as a working Mom, I made a decent wage.  When she was a young Mom, women made much less for the same workweek than men.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe was mothering in a virtual warzone with my Dad -- and I know we weren&#39;t the only household where that was true in that time.  She might have heard of families where things were different, but for her that was a pipe dream at best.  More likely, it was just another reminder of how powerless she was to effect change in her own life and those of her children.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn recent years -- say the last two, really -- she&#39;s softened in many ways.  I realize, too, that much of her harshness in response is about her fears that she will have somehow failed us, and her awareness of how easy it is to fail one&#39;s children as a mother.  She knows how high the stakes are (and just how unkind life can be), and she&#39;s seen us all suffer for the circumstances she wasn&#39;t able to change when we were young.  I can see it breaks her heart.  She&#39;s bitter at times, and I can understand why.  Her life didn&#39;t turn out at all as she had hoped it would.  She has also said she&#39;s very blessed -- her life plans didn&#39;t include children, and she can&#39;t imagine not being a Mom.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy point is that our mothers lived in a very different world than we do, than most of us can even conceive.  My Mom did many things differently than I do, but above all we always knew she loved us.  Somehow that told me the rest would work itself out, if only I kept trying.  I &#39;got&#39; that from watching her always try for us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom to Will (20) Andy (9) and Dan (4.5) <br/>\n <br/>\nThe opposite of courage in our society is not cowardice, it is conformity -- Rollo May<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n Start your day with Yahoo! - make it your home page <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Parenting question","postDate":"1124714052","msgId":6178,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDNzc1MkNFRjQ4NjA4Qy0yNzAtRjIxQUBNQkxLLU0yNC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwODIyMTIxNzQxLjExNzAwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzODA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6177,"nextInTopic":6179,"prevInTime":6177,"nextInTime":6179,"topicId":6157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

La Leche League didn&#39;t come knocking on my door,  John Holt&#39;s books weren&#39;t placed in a basket on my doorstep, and unschooling message boards didn&#39;t lay down in my path, ya know?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not an unschooler because I was lucky enough to be exposed to it.  I&#39;m an unschooler because I seek and I seek until I find what makes sense and what feels right in my heart and soul.<br/>\n&quot;I didn&#39;t know better&quot; is a pretty lame excuse when it comes to parenting IMO.  Forgivable but lame. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nPatti</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163221353,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;zoocrew@...&gt;","profile":"tina010871","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Parenting question","postDate":"1124677915","msgId":6162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlYmRlcityNXZpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGRlOTdpbytzOHVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":6157,"nextInTopic":6165,"prevInTime":6161,"nextInTime":6163,"topicId":6157,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... that don t necessarily treat their children with respect most of the time.
