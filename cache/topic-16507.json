I&#39;d like to print it out so I can read it to myself as a<br/>\nreminder. Would you mind?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything I write online is public information that you can do with as<br/>\nyou choose (other than use it and put someone elses name on it:).<br/>\nThank you for the kind words.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the cleaning up issue...<br/>\nChildren that grow up with the attitude of dependency on another<br/>\nperson to clean up for them, are usually those that aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>\nhelp in their own way. What I&#39;ve discovered (as I released my chores<br/>\nissues over the years) is that children WANT to help, they WANT to be<br/>\na part of day to day activities.  They just don&#39;t always want to do it<br/>\nthe way an adult wants them to do it!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have their own way of doing things and helping, we need to honor<br/>\nthat. Let them help even if it means that the job isn&#39;t done very<br/>\nwell. Clean up after them because you&#39;re providing a new canvas for<br/>\ncreative explorations. What if you had a small Einstein or Picasso in<br/>\nyour care? Would it be important to help them clean up so they could<br/>\nget on with the really important work of becoming the creative<br/>\ngeniuses they were born to be? Of course it would!<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren don&#39;t learn dependency by having someone help them clean<br/>\nup(or cleaning up for them), they learn that you are willing to place<br/>\nyour relationship with them above stuff. As they dabble in and out of<br/>\nhelping you, they WILL grow into reponsibility, just as they learn<br/>\neverything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they can learn to read in their own time and way, then they can<br/>\nlearn to clean in their own time and way too. And the best part? They<br/>\nwill be helping you because it&#39;s in their hearts, because they CARE,<br/>\nnot because some authority figure told them to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ask my kids for help too...nothing wrong with being honest about<br/>\nyour needs (depending on age and ability of child of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m tired and cleaning up another mess, sometimes I chant to<br/>\nmyself &quot;I&#39;m helping my creative geniuses, I&#39;m helping my creative<br/>\ngeniuses&quot; or something similar. And sometimes I feel like the<br/>\nscribbles on the walls and the broken/lost items or chocolate blobs on<br/>\nthe floor with NEVER end!! Then I look at my teens and realize that<br/>\nthe only &quot;mess&quot; I really encounter with them is some dishes (yep, they<br/>\neven choose to keep their rooms clean, all on their own) and that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t last forever. I remind myself to enjoy these messes, because<br/>\n*I* chose to have them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to have children and children are most inconvenient, messy and<br/>\nbusy individuals. I chose that. Their messes are a sign that they are<br/>\nhealthy, happy, learning and ALIVE!! I try to be thankful for those<br/>\nmesses (it doesn&#39;t always translate into gratitude, but a shift in<br/>\nthinking helps a LOT).<br/>\n<br/>\nSierra does not like cleaning up her room. I usually clean it for her<br/>\n(which is an amazing task because she and Jalen can trash it fairly<br/>\nquick) by myself. She dabbles in and out of helping sometimes, but if<br/>\nit&#39;s really bad, she just can&#39;t cope with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result? A child that LOVES to do dishes, loves cooking with me,<br/>\nsetting the table, even folding laundry when she sees me doing it.<br/>\nShe&#39;s only 9 years old, she does more than I ever did at that age. But<br/>\nI don&#39;t make an issue out of what she doen&#39;t do, so she&#39;s more willing<br/>\nto help in other areas. She really appreciates the gift of a clean<br/>\nroom. Cleaning up for my kids has fostered better relationships all<br/>\nthe way around.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie to the list and unschooling","postDate":"1155777553","msgId":16526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODhGQjI0OTIxQjZDOC0yNjAtMzZENkBGV00tTTA5LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjMGR2aCtpMTJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16525,"nextInTopic":16531,"prevInTime":16525,"nextInTime":16527,"topicId":16507,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
