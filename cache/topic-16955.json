We have control over our financial choices (yes, sometimes the<br/>\nfinances don&#39;t support the desires, but we&#39;re of a developmental stage<br/>\nthat it&#39;s easier to understand that) and if we really examine our<br/>\nchoices, there is often an imbalance where children are concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nI catch myself sometimes....yeah, I&#39;m going to get that chocolate bar<br/>\nfor myself, but no, we can&#39;t buy that toy today. duh.<br/>\nI think part of my challenge, is having four children. A &quot;treat&quot; for<br/>\nmyself is cheap. A &quot;treat&quot; for one of the kids has to be multiplied by<br/>\nfour ususally!  There are times I notice an inconsistency in my<br/>\nwillingness to spend, and I think that&#39;s a good thing to examine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we really don&#39;t have enough money, that&#39;s one thing. But sometimes<br/>\nwe value certain items above others and that isn&#39;t fair to our child<br/>\nwith the desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child chooses something you deem &quot;worthy&quot; is it more likely to<br/>\nget purchased?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we need to take our children&#39;s desires seriously, while also<br/>\nmodeling thoughtful choices in consumption. In the case we&#39;re<br/>\ndiscussing, it didn&#39;t seem like the mother was saying &quot;no&quot; for any<br/>\ngood reason....I can just about bet that a huge part of the whining<br/>\nwas that child seeing the hypocrisy of the &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nA child will pick up on an arbitrary &quot;no&quot; in a heartbeat! They&#39;re<br/>\namazing that way. If you buy yourself a coffee, a magazine then say<br/>\n&quot;no&quot; to your child&#39;s desire for a hot wheels, they&#39;re going to whine<br/>\nbecause you&#39;re a hypocrite!!
