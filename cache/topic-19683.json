I have an autistic son who loves this sort of stuff. He likes to lay under his mattress (head out) have his backpack on with a few books in it, have me squish him under a pillow ( again of course head out) . These are sensory tool and are proven calmers for some kids...the bodysock included. They can be a great help. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  What this teacher did wrong in my opinion......<br/>\n   <br/>\n  First no kid with asthma should be given a &quot;therapy&quot; that restrains their chest...no the body sock dosent but I like to mention it because I dont want anyone trying to squish their asmatic child with pillows. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Second ....Always, always, always respect the childs wishes.... Would you like to be a burrito today ? ( wrapping a blanket tightly around the child ) then assuming the child gave a yes ...you need to stay right with the child and give assurance that as soon as they ( child ) says Im done you will unwrap and of course follow through with that. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I dont think its abuse in fact can help a great deal but it sometimes worries me because when done the wrong way it can go from something that a child might have tried after seeing it 3 or 4 times and might have been helped by to something they are horrified of. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole<br/>\n<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

As a former teacher and parent.  I <br/>\nhave both seen and used the &quot;body sock&quot; but it&#39;s not at all what they <br/>\nmake it out to be.  When we used it in our class room it was brought <br/>\nin by a museum group called Arts Partners.  It was used for movement <br/>\njust like scarves and stretchy bands, instruments and other such <br/>\nthings.  Kids were allowed to try it and move around to the beat of <br/>\nmusic.  No child was forced, but we encouraged them to try it out for <br/>\nsomething new.  Most of the kids loved it.  But, if they were <br/>\nuncomfortable then they didn&#39;t do it, no big deal.  This teacher <br/>\nmight have been a wacko who thought it was calming and tried to <br/>\nassert it in another way, but when I read the part about the <br/>\nassistant putting a child back in I thought, maybe she misunderstood <br/>\nthe child and thought he needed help getting back in.  They had these <br/>\nat an arts festival I took my daughter to in August then, 2.5 yo.  I <br/>\ngot in and showed it to my dd so she&#39;d know what it was.  I appeared <br/>\nto be the only person there who knew what they were for, so I kind of <br/>\ndemonstrated to everyone.  It&#39;s a lycra type material that you can <br/>\neasily see out of and breath, unless of course you&#39;re closterphobic <br/>\nor something.  Anyway, dd tried it out a couple of times, but <br/>\nultimately she&#39;s not into that kind of thing, she wasn&#39;t interested <br/>\nin most the stuff in the music / movement section.  Anyway, I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow exactly what was going on there, but I rather doubt the district <br/>\nor even school as a whole use it as &quot;punishment&quot;  Just wantd to set <br/>\nthe record straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMisty</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":278107510,"authorName":"alisonslp","from":"&quot;alisonslp&quot; &lt;alisonslp@...&gt;","profile":"alisonslp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: and they say we&#39;re crazy?!?","postDate":"1166156173","msgId":19749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVsdDdpZCtwOG5nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVscnJjaStuZWh0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19735,"nextInTopic":19843,"prevInTime":19748,"nextInTime":19750,"topicId":19683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
