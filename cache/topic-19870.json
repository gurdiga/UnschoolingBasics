The problem seems to me to be that<br/>\nthe natural limits that govern life are sometimes unclear. If a child is so<br/>\nallergic to peanuts that eating any could send him into shock, then �limiting�<br/>\npeanuts is a no-brainer. But most things are judgment calls. My son and his<br/>\nwife (I live with them) select fresh foods of such variety that my granddaughter<br/>\nreally can�t eat poorly. Candy is available in smallish quantities. If she<br/>\nwants something, it goes on the shopping list and she finds something else to<br/>\neat in the meantime. Soda, chips other highly processed foods aren�t controlled<br/>\nbut are seldom in the house. Curiously, they do require her to eat something by<br/>\nway of breakfast before they�ll let her watch TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI take my granddaughter shopping with me and see the effect<br/>\nof advertising and packaging on her. I have a rule of my own that I do not make<br/>\nimpulse purchases at the checkout counter and have extended that rule to her.<br/>\nArbitrary? Or sanity saving? She selects food such as mac & cheese because<br/>\nit has Arthur or Dora on the packaging. Then she doesn�t eat it because she<br/>\ndoesn�t like it and I�m left with mixed feelings because on the one hand it�s<br/>\nwasteful but on the other its respectful of her choices and eventually she<br/>\nshould learn she doesn�t necessarily like foods with Arthur or Dora on the<br/>\npackage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just recalled that when my kids where young I�d let them<br/>\neach select one item, no questions asked. Had to put a $5 limit on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another topic where limits may or may not be advisable, my<br/>\nson has done some reading on pornography and says that first exposure can be<br/>\ndamaging and not undone (can�t unring the bell). He says he does not want to<br/>\ncreate forbidden fruit nor rules that any kid with gumption will defy but he<br/>\ndoesn�t want his daughters, now 4.5 yrs and 5 wks, seeing porn at age 11<br/>\n(supposedly the average age of first exposure on the web). We discussed the<br/>\npossibility that if the girls really trust him and see him as enabling their<br/>\ngoals, they may accept his limits until they reach an agreed age (18? 21?).

This was presented as liberating news for parents and children alike in<br/>\nthat parents did not have to force their children to eat what the parents<br/>\nchose. In a second phase of the experiment they introduced foods with refined<br/>\nsugar and that changed the results. Children chose the sugars foods to an<br/>\nextent that unbalanced their diets. In the first phase all the food choices had<br/>\nbeen natural foods.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my understanding that refined foods such as refined<br/>\nsugar and refined flour throw off our bodies operation.
