Her children are in <br/>\nps of course, so she is defending it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s my take:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat might you be doing/saying that is causing her to feel the need to<br/>\ndefend public school and her choice to have her kids in it? I mean aside<br/>\nfrom just being alive and happy in Unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the conversation started with her grumbling about school, and you said<br/>\nthat she had a choice. School bashing is easy. Letting go of the security<br/>\nthat is part of doing what the greater part of society sanctions is not<br/>\neasy. Defending what she may in heart see as a &quot;necessary evil&quot; means that<br/>\nshe and her family are not ready. Maybe they will become so one day and be<br/>\nready to drop the &quot;necessary&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally do not get involved in school conversations. People who know I<br/>\nhomeschool sometimes want to start defending school to me. I just don&#39;t do<br/>\nthose conversations. It is not up to me to make people feel better about the<br/>\nchoice to stay in the system. I will gladly talk about *what* we do which<br/>\nseems to fascinate people, but I have found that talking about *why* we do<br/>\nit sometimes raises defenses, unless the person is actually considering it.<br/>\nI try to just let it wash over me with a general response like, &quot;we&#39;re<br/>\nreally happy&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t do curriculum or &quot;how do I *get* her to....&quot; or reading list<br/>\nconversations either with my local group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just me. Other people will have better things to suggest. But one<br/>\nthing I urge you to contemplate is why you feel you have to respond to her,<br/>\nor change her mind, at all. That may give you an idea for what to say to<br/>\nher. Many people have found that the proof is in the pudding so to speak,<br/>\nwhen your friends see what charming, interesting and well-informed<br/>\nadolescents your have in the home.
