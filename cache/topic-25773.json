I<br/>\ndecided I love being their mom, and I did not want to be their teacher.  I<br/>\nwanted to be the mom that took them to the museum and pointed out the facts<br/>\nand articles.  I wanted to be the one to record Emergency Vets for my 10<br/>\nyear old who has her heart set on being a Vet.  I also record Planet Earth<br/>\nso when she is interested, she can learn about the earth, and several other<br/>\n�educational� shows.  She lets me know when she wants to watch one.  (We<br/>\nhave a DVR and she will scroll through and see what all is recorded) She<br/>\ntalked with our Vet and the Vet said to make sure she took all the math<br/>\nclasses she could, so she picked out some math CD�s (half price) at Staples<br/>\nand she will occasionally ask to work on it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor my 6 year old; she watches Noggin all day with her 2 year old sister.<br/>\nAnd has a Lepster L-max that she will not put down.  We finally had to get<br/>\nre-chargeable batteries for it she uses it so much.    My mom gave me a lot<br/>\nof grief about leaving the TV on all day, until she realized my 18 month<br/>\nyear old could count to 10 without missing a number!  They love Noggin and<br/>\ncan even speak some Spanish they have learned from Dora and Diego.  I have<br/>\nflash cards with colors and a shape on them that I leave in my 2 year old�s<br/>\nreach.  About twice a week, she will bring them to me and tell me she wants<br/>\nto do rectangles.  I never make her do anything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 6 year old can only read a few words, and writes her numbers and letters<br/>\nbackwards.  So what?  So did my 10 year old, who did not learn how to read<br/>\nuntil the end of 1st grade.  When I pulled her from public school, she was<br/>\nin the �gifted� class due to her test results, and made straight A�s and the<br/>\noccasional B.  All her friends were dreading going to school, their moms<br/>\nwhere having to buy the �in� clothes (can we say $$$$?) and what are my kids<br/>\ndoing the first day of school?  They are going to Jumpzone (a local indoor<br/>\nplay ground filled with inflatable slides) after my oldest daughter does her<br/>\nvolunteer work at our church to socialize with several other homeschooled<br/>\nkids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you the best of luck; I read every book I could get my hands on, and<br/>\nevery article on the web I had time for. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a wonderful feeling it is!<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa V  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/25601;_ylc=X3oDMTJz\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/25601;_ylc=X3oDMTJz</a><br/>\naXUzc29qBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE1BGdycElkAzEyNzg5NTEzBGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA4MTk3MgRtc2dJ<br/>\nZAMyNTYwMQRzZWMDZG1zZwRzbGsDdm1zZwRzdGltZQMxMTg2NjI2MjYz&quot;Re: Seeking your<br/>\nadvice and your wisdom <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by: &quot;Tyra-Goddess-Body-Mind-Spirit.com&quot; HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>?Subject=%20Re%3A%20Seeking%20your%20advic<br/>\ne%20and%20your%20wisdom&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:motherspirit@...\">motherspirit@...</a>   HYPERLINK<br/>\n&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://profiles.yahoo.com/breastisbesttn&quot;breastisbesttn\">http://profiles.yahoo.com/breastisbesttn&quot;breastisbesttn</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nWed Aug 8, 2007 3:23 pm (PST) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, sometimes we know and believe but we forget. I think that is what<br/>\nhas happened to me. As I have pondered responses that I have received from<br/>\nmy different groups, I think to myself that I need to get a bit more<br/>\nsimplicity in my life. I decided to homeschool him the first year that we<br/>\nstarted this learning at home thing. It was after the utter failure of my<br/>\nschoolish approach. But my life was way more simple and so I could see that<br/>\nhe was learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still stand true that I do reside in insecurity. What I gained for your<br/>\nwords, Kelly, is to not scapegoat an take responsibility for what is really<br/>\ngoing on. The truth is that I fear that I will fail at unschooling. I am<br/>\nalso clear that I fear having fingers point at me saying that I failed in<br/>\nsome way. All of this coupled with my busy-ness makes me want to do more<br/>\nstructured things so that I can have a peace of mind that we are at least<br/>\ndoing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I am off to ponder and determine how to integrate more simplicity so<br/>\nthat I CAN see that my children are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and thanks again<br/>\nTyra <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Free Edition. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.476 / Virus Database: 269.11.17/951 - Release Date: 8/13/2007<br/>\n10:15 AM<br/>\n <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25784,"nextTopicId":25785}}
