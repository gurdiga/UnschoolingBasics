Same with<br/>\n&gt; green pepper.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup - especially when the red bell peppers go on sale - we buy a <br/>\nbunch and freeze them in stir fry/fajita size strips. The only <br/>\nproblem we&#39;ve had with that is that once they&#39;re frozen they can <br/>\nonly be used cooked. So, like you, we&#39;ll have some fresh pepper <br/>\ndishes that week and then cooked pepper dishes the rest of the time. <br/>\nOnions don&#39;t seem to have the same problem - though we rarely use <br/>\nthem raw, since the taste is too strong for DS and sometimes even I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want the raw onion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Most of my family eats meat, so what ever meat is &quot;buy 1 get 1 <br/>\n&gt;free&quot;<br/>\n&gt; that week I will get 4 packages and freeze 3 using one fresh that<br/>\n&gt; week.  Maybe the next week there isn&#39;t much meat I want on sale (we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t eat a lot of beef, mostly chicken, pork and boca - poor <br/>\n&gt;little<br/>\n&gt; boca birds)  We do a lot of &quot;scratch&quot; cooking, so we purchase few<br/>\n&gt; pre-packaged foods.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup - us too - mostly from scratch. One thing we do go ahead and buy <br/>\nare the big blocks of Velveeta when they are on sale - makes great <br/>\nmac & cheese and we try to use organic pasta and balance the <br/>\nVelveeta out with other stuff (veggies in the mac & cheese, salads, <br/>\netc).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;The kids even prefer organic mac-n-cheese.  We<br/>\n&gt; shop at a natural food co-op as well as the regular grocery store, <br/>\n&gt;so<br/>\n&gt; there are some things (like milk, eggs, chocolate, and coffee - <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt; must be organic and fair trade) that we just suck up and buy at<br/>\n&gt; regular price.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>No readily accessible co-ops near us that I know of (they might be <br/>\nthere and I just don&#39;t know they exist). The best price/quality <br/>\nnatural foods are a good 30 to 45 minute highway drive and with the <br/>\nprice of gas, it&#39;s just not worth the gas money - especially because <br/>\nour grocery store (Big Y) is starting to stock a lot more organic <br/>\nfoods throughout the store. The one we go to is 5 minutes from the <br/>\nhouse and is in a very &quot;upscale-ish&quot; neighboring town close to a <br/>\nmajor university - both of which are very organic, green, whole food <br/>\ntype market niches.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; found that instead of being on sale for a week, they are on sale <br/>\n&gt;for a<br/>\n&gt; month at a time, which actually makes stocking up on those items<br/>\n&gt; easier because I can buy an extra 2 or 3 this week and then an <br/>\n&gt;extra 2<br/>\n&gt; or 3 the following week.  I did that with mac-n-cheese and shredded<br/>\n&gt; wheat last month.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is nice - I&#39;ve seen our grocery do that with some things as <br/>\nwell - they are on special for longer time frames. However, since we <br/>\nonly do a major grocery shopping once every 3 weeks or so, I have to <br/>\nwatch for stuff because it may not be on special 3 weeks later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;ve got quite a few blocks of cheese in the freezer.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How well does the cheese do in the freezer? What kinds work best and <br/>\nwhat kinds just don&#39;t freeze for beans? DS is a cheese lover (we <br/>\nhave, at last count, 5 kinds of cheese in the fridge and that&#39;s <br/>\nbecause we ran out of 3 or 4 already). We like fresh parmesan, <br/>\nricotta, cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella, provolone, cream cheese <br/>\n(I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not a good candidate for the freezer), Swiss <br/>\n(a gruyere and ementhaler fondue is one of our favorite meals), and <br/>\nsometimes cottage cheese (that&#39;s more of a come and go thing than a <br/>\nregular because of the sodium level).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and natural peanut butter.  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah - that&#39;s a toughie. DH keeps bringing up cleaning out our now-<br/>\nlittle-used coffee grinder and just buying peanuts to grind up for <br/>\npeanut butter. But it hasn&#39;t happened yet. We had some name-brand PB <br/>\nleftover from a recipe DH made for a gathering (the hydrogenated <br/>\nstuff really makes a better texture in this recipe) and when DH made <br/>\na sandwich with it (to use it up), he had to get rid of it - he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t eat it, he said it tasted like eating lard (which it mostly <br/>\nis).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, aside from the couponing, it&#39;s just a matter of judicious <br/>\nshopping techniques.

I did that with mac-n-cheese and shredded<br/>\nwheat last month.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t really *need* the grocery game to tell you how to shop.  I<br/>\nthink they have some good guidelines that you can learn from.  Some<br/>\nweeks we only use 1 or 2 coupons and some weeks we use none at all.<br/>\nIt is very rare that I have 5-10 coupons, but I still save between<br/>\n33%-40% each week.  It took us a few weeks to build a stockpile, now<br/>\nwhen we see our favorite foods on sale, we always buy a few extra.<br/>\nI&#39;ve got quite a few blocks of cheese in the freezer.  I&#39;m always<br/>\nlooking for deals for organic flour (or at the very least King Arthur<br/>\nflour) and, like you, I throw an extra 5 or 10 lbs into the freezer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all about being aware of what things normally cost, knowing when<br/>\nthings are on sale, and taking advantage of sales when they come up so<br/>\nthat you buy more than what you need just this week.  There are some<br/>\nthings, though, that I just have never seen on sale like Polerna fruit<br/>\nspread and natural peanut butter.

Plus we&#39;re really working hard to eat better <br/>\nquality foods and dontcha know they cost more (organic, whole grain, <br/>\nnon-sugar, HFCS, lard, and sodium laden products). That&#39;s what got <br/>\nDH to pull out the bread machine and find a convenient home for it <br/>\nso it can be used a lot (I think it&#39;s done 3 loaves in the last 4 <br/>\ndays or so - because they are getting eaten right up, which is good, <br/>\nit tends to mold quickly without all those preservatives when the <br/>\nweather gets humid).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 1.  Budget (yes; really budget take it out every period) a certain<br/>\n&gt; amount of money for &quot;fun&quot;  Be it $20 a week or $50 a paycheck.<br/>\n&gt; Whatever it is, budget it in.  Whatever is leftover at the end of <br/>\n&gt;that<br/>\n&gt; period goes into the &quot;savings jar.&quot;  (We made it to Disney one year<br/>\n&gt; doing this!)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>DH and I did that back when when we were trying to pay off my car <br/>\nbefore we got married. We&#39;d put $10 each (total $20) each payday <br/>\ninto an envelope. That was our &#39;going out&#39; money. We could do <br/>\nwhatever, but when it was gone that was it until next payday. <br/>\nSometimes we&#39;d leave it there to accumulate for a couple paydays and <br/>\ngo out someplace fancy. Back then, we&#39;d go to the dollar theater to <br/>\nsee second run movies - we&#39;d stop at Burger King and order one meal <br/>\nand an extra cheeseburger for dinner then pay $5 (okay so it was <br/>\nlike $2.50 per movie not $1...) for the movie - the whole evening <br/>\ncame to about $10. Since we got paid every other week, $10 per week <br/>\nworked out well.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 2.  Don&#39;t use your change.  Take all your change at the end of the <br/>\n&gt;day<br/>\n&gt; and put it in your &quot;savings jar.&quot;  You will be surprised how <br/>\n&gt;quickly<br/>\n&gt; it grows.  Get in the habit of looking for lost change on the<br/>\n&gt; sidewalk.  If you look for it you will find it!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>All change in our house is &quot;pig food&quot; - it goes in DS pig shaped <br/>\nbank. He saves it up pretty much all year then we take it to the <br/>\nbank and exchange it for cash come September when the Big E fair <br/>\nopens (it&#39;s an all-New England state fair thing that runs for about <br/>\n3 weeks). Last year he had roughly $40 in his pig to use at the fair <br/>\n(plus the allowance he had saved up - he had roughly $70 to use as <br/>\nhe saw fit at the fair).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 4.  Budget in money for your kids to be able to control.  Call it<br/>\n&gt; allowance (with no strings attached) or &quot;payday&quot; or whatever works <br/>\n&gt;for<br/>\n&gt; your family.  Just give it to them so that they can save it, spend <br/>\n&gt;it<br/>\n&gt; or give it.  With them having control over money many &quot;gimme&#39;s&quot; go<br/>\n&gt; away.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Definitely. DS gets &quot;paid&quot; on the same schedule I get paid - because <br/>\nthat&#39;s when I pay bills. I kept forgetting when it was weekly so we <br/>\nagreed that he&#39;d get the two weeks&#39; worth at once each time I got <br/>\npaid. He&#39;s usually the only one in the house with cash on hand (but <br/>\nthen again, DH and I leave the money in the bank until we need to <br/>\nuse it for something rather than carrying it around).<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 6.  Find inexpensive meals that you substitute for a more expensive<br/>\n&gt; meal each week.  Our family loves grilled cheese sandwiches so <br/>\n&gt;when we<br/>\n&gt; are in &quot;savings mode&quot; we had soup and grilled cheese one night a <br/>\n&gt;week.<br/>\n&gt;  You could do soup and salads or &quot;lunch fare&quot; or homemade pizzas.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And don&#39;t forget leftovers! We have one shelf in the fridge where we <br/>\ntry to store all leftovers so they don&#39;t slip into oblivion and <br/>\nbecome science experiments. Then somewhere late in the week (Friday, <br/>\nSaturday, Sunday) we&#39;ll have a leftover night where we pull it all <br/>\nout and mix and match.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and other &#39;savings mode&#39; dinners could be things like pancakes <br/>\nfor dinner. Sometimes we even do cereal (warm or cold, individual <br/>\nchoice) for dinner on weekends since we&#39;re usually all tuckered out <br/>\nby evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; 7.  Learn the rules of &quot;the grocery game&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; we could take advantage of meat sales and other good produce sales.<br/>\n&gt; We have enough groceries in our house to feed us for several weeks<br/>\n&gt; (sans milk, eggs, bread and fresh produce) without having to go<br/>\n&gt; shopping and we have spent no more than we normally would (and I<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t have to shop at Walmart to do so - I LOATHE that store!)  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yup - also, minimizing the meat budget (if your family is willing) <br/>\ncan also save bundles of money if you&#39;ve traditionally been big on <br/>\nthe meat menu. We typically have a couple of pounds of ground meat <br/>\n(preferably turkey but whatever was at a good price will do) and one <br/>\nor two whole chickens and a package of thighs or breasts in the <br/>\nfreezer maybe some hot dogs and that&#39;s it. Things like stir frys and <br/>\nfajitas can feed a family of 5 or 6 on 1 lb of meat. Ditto for <br/>\nbeanful chilis and veggie ful stews. Our one big budget item in this <br/>\narea is buying fresh fish - and using it the next day (so it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nget fishy). Right now, too, we are spending more for milk with <br/>\ndeliberation because it is from a local farmer&#39;s co-op (one of the <br/>\nfarms is about a mile up the road from us). We want it to stay a <br/>\nfamily farm and not get condo&#39;d or whatever so we are specifically <br/>\nwilling to pay more for it - and it is also helping us to cut back <br/>\nsome on our dairy intake as well. We get a set amount each week and <br/>\nwhen it&#39;s gone, that&#39;s it until the next shopping trip (for milk and <br/>\nfresh stuff). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that I used to do (back in the poor college days when <br/>\ngas was cheap - we lived in OK and back then gas was about 60 to 75 <br/>\ncents per gallon, it hit $1 and we were shocked): shop at more than <br/>\none grocery store. There was one store that had good, inexpensive <br/>\nmeats, another that had really good sales on canned and frozen foods <br/>\nmost of the time, and a third where I&#39;d buy the produce and dairy <br/>\nproducts. I&#39;d also add a stop as needed at a local whole <br/>\nfoods/healthy foods market (Akins for any of y&#39;all out that way) for <br/>\nthings like whole grain flours and such. And, I&#39;d do a stop at Sam&#39;s <br/>\nClub for bulk items like toilet paper and cleaning supplies - that <br/>\nwas roughly once a quarter or so. So, while DH was at home making <br/>\ndough stuff on Saturdays, I would spend several hours going from <br/>\nstore to store - for each store, I&#39;d write the list on the outside <br/>\nof a plain white business envelope and tuck in any &quot;saver card&quot; and <br/>\ncoupons for that store. when I arrived at the location, I&#39;d grab the <br/>\nappropriately labelled envelope and go. It took time, for sure, <br/>\nsince I&#39;d make the list of what we needed to buy, then I&#39;d check all <br/>\nthe circulars for where to get each item, cut coupons, and do all <br/>\nthat on Friday evening. Then I&#39;d take it all and head out Saturday <br/>\nafter breakfast (between 8 and 9 usually) and I&#39;d get home somewhere <br/>\nbetween 11 and 12. Back then we had lots more time than we did money <br/>\n(and it was before DS was born). Now we have more money and less <br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, looking around online to find alternative ways of <br/>\ncleaning around the house (vinegar and water rubbed with a sheet of <br/>\nnewsprint is supposed to be great for cleaning glass for example) <br/>\nwould cut the really expensive household cleanser budget. Oh, and we <br/>\npicked up a big pack of &#39;bar rags&#39; (or &#39;bar towels&#39;) at Sam&#39;s Club a <br/>\nwhile back - basic, cheap, white, cotton/terry washcloths like they <br/>\nuse to wipe bars with. They are reusable (ours are still going <br/>\nstrong after about 2 years or more) and can handle everything from <br/>\nscrubbing the sink to washing grubby feet to dusting the furniture <br/>\nto being used for blowing noses during allergy and flu seasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Budgeting and Unschooling...","postDate":"1156341624","msgId":16662,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MjMwNzAwazFmYTA0NzVjcDY0ODBjZmJhZGVjMWEwMThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjaGpscStyNzAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVjZm9iZCtqOXRoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ZWNoamxxK3I3MDJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16661,"nextInTopic":16667,"prevInTime":16661,"nextInTime":16663,"topicId":16601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Get in the habit of looking for lost change on the<br/>\nsidewalk.  If you look for it you will find it!<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Reward yourself for not eating out.  You could spend $20+ on fast<br/>\nfood for food that would cost you $10 to buy and cook yourself (with<br/>\nbetter portions and more healthy foods).  So throw that extra $10 you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t spend into your &quot;savings jar.&quot;  I hate eating out because I&#39;m<br/>\nrarely satisfied (taste wise) and always overstuffed because I still<br/>\nhave that &quot;clean plate mentality&quot; leftover from my childhood!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  Budget in money for your kids to be able to control.  Call it<br/>\nallowance (with no strings attached) or &quot;payday&quot; or whatever works for<br/>\nyour family.  Just give it to them so that they can save it, spend it<br/>\nor give it.  With them having control over money many &quot;gimme&#39;s&quot; go<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  I used to reward myself for losing weight.  I had joined Weight<br/>\nWatchers and would reward myself $3-$5 for every pound I lost.  Then I<br/>\ndecided that I only felt badly when I didn&#39;t lose weight (or (gasp)<br/>\ngained weight) so I started rewarding myself just for going to<br/>\nmeetings.  Then I found the meetings really uninspiring and hated<br/>\ngoing.  So then I rewarded myself for staying on points.  And then I<br/>\nquit dieting. So I don&#39;t really recommend this anymore LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  Find inexpensive meals that you substitute for a more expensive<br/>\nmeal each week.

Yes, things may be tight, really tight, but <br/>\nsometimes feeling that it will &quot;always&quot; be as it is can stifle <br/>\nliving an abundant life (which has little to do with how much money <br/>\nor stuff one has) and that can freeze up any creative thinking about <br/>\nthings to where it becomes &quot;no we can&#39;t do that, we have no money&quot;, <br/>\nno no no, negative, negative, negative instead of &quot;gee that looks <br/>\nlike fun/looks interesting.

It&#39;s not black & <br/>\nwhite &quot;yes we can/no we can&#39;t&quot; there&#39;s a whole range of &quot;well, we <br/>\ncan&#39;t buy a horse but we can go visit the horses over at the <br/>\nfarm&quot;, &quot;we can&#39;t buy a horse right now, but we can look into what <br/>\nhorse shows are near us&quot;, &quot;hmm we can&#39;t buy a horse yet but maybe <br/>\nyou could start helping out over at so-and-so&#39;s where there are <br/>\nhorses&quot;, &quot;maybe so-and-so would trade riding time for help in the <br/>\nstable&quot;, and so on...<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;and <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t afford it at the time they&#39;ll loose interest or just stop <br/>\n&gt; asking altogether about anything because they&#39;ll know the answer.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, if you&#39;re exploring and brainstorming instead of just saying <br/>\nno, this is less likely to happen.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so they have to wait till next month to &gt;see <br/>\n&gt; if we get paid more then, or for me to start saving for that. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  except that <br/>\n&gt; this month I was able to put aside some money for each of the kids <br/>\n&gt; for when they show an interest in something that requires money. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>See there, you&#39;re second sentence shows that the first sentence is <br/>\nnot quite as binding as you seem to see it. They *don&#39;t* have to <br/>\nwait until next month for you to &quot;start&quot; saving for things since <br/>\nyou&#39;ve *already begun* saving for things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;But <br/>\n&gt; the money was so little, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>So what? A penny, at even modest interest, can grow mightily over <br/>\ntime. A mustard seed, tiny little thing, can grow to become one of <br/>\nthe largest trees around.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m going to try again next month, and the <br/>\n&gt; next.....<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As the great philosopher Yoda said &quot;There is no try, only do&quot;. Just <br/>\ndo it - even if it&#39;s $1 in loose change from the couch cushions.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Their interests:<br/>\n&gt; Baking/experimenting in the kitchen <br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a great place to extend the budget - if ingredient A is kind <br/>\nof expensive, how can we make this recipe with a less expensive <br/>\ningredient? or, gee, our favorite BBQ sauce is $3 for a small <br/>\nbottle, let&#39;s try to make our own... (cans of tomato sauce or home <br/>\nmade tomato sauce, plus some seasonings that you usually have on <br/>\nhand, tends to come out way cheaper than pre-made). And so on. For <br/>\ninstance, our favorite whole grain oat bread is close to $3 per loaf <br/>\n(and a small loaf at that). BUT unbleached all purpose flour, whole <br/>\nwheat flour, and oat bran flour are all available at the grocery <br/>\nstore. $5 or $6 worth of flours plus water, yeast, etc can make <br/>\ndozens and dozens of loaves that are even fresher and tastier than <br/>\nthat $3 loaf. Back when DH was in college (talk about shoestring <br/>\nbudgets...and we also got paid once a month there - we both worked <br/>\nfor the university and they paid once a month), Saturday was &quot;Dough <br/>\nDay&quot; - we&#39;d make two loaves of bread (by hand back then, couldn&#39;t <br/>\nafford a bread machine), a stack of flour tortillas, and maybe some <br/>\npizza dough or fresh bagels - all the flour and yeast type stuff for <br/>\nthe week. It saved money (back then I worked it out that while one <br/>\nloaf of decent bread at the grocery cost $2-$3, we could bake a <br/>\nfresh homemade loaf for about $1)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of websites with recipes...just about anything you <br/>\ncan think of. Maybe even try out different types of ethnic foods <br/>\nwith a twist. Most every culture has something wrapped in some form <br/>\nof dough (ravioli, pierogi, potstickers, empanadas, etc) - the <br/>\nfillings vary but the basic doughs are pretty simple flour, oil, <br/>\nwater type combinations. Cheap, but filling and tasty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; robots<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Making them might be tough on your own (the hardware and tools can <br/>\nbe expensive) BUT look for robotics teams/competitions in your area -<br/>\n even if you just go to watch sometimes. Check out ebay (or local <br/>\nsecond hand stores) for a used, but working, Lego mindstorms set. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; computer games<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Find your local GameStop type store where you can get used games AND <br/>\ntrade in games for other games. If we have a game that isn&#39;t being <br/>\nused, we return it for store credit toward another used game. <br/>\nSometimes they run deals like return 3 games get a used game free. <br/>\nFor stuff that is no longer of interest, it works well. Also, check <br/>\ninto websites like NeoPets and such which have all sorts of games to <br/>\nplay and are FREE.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; jewelry making<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Try paper jewelry. I have a beautiful necklace a friend made that is <br/>\nbeads made of wrapping paper rolled tightly and strung on fishing <br/>\nline (which is pretty cheap to buy). If you want more info on that, <br/>\nlet me know (here or directly via my profile info) - DH made a 6 <br/>\nfoot long garland out of old holiday catalogs for last Christmas - <br/>\nso I could pass along how he did it - basically it cost no new money <br/>\nsince we already had the fishing line, the glue sticks, the catalogs <br/>\n(they come by the handfuls for free), the scissors, and the bamboo <br/>\nskewers (he used a skewer as the center to make sure the hole in the <br/>\nmiddle for stringing it stayed open).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ice skating<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Skates can be found at second hand shops often (especially in the <br/>\nspring when folks are getting rid of kids&#39; skates that they know the <br/>\nkids won&#39;t be wearing next season). Where we are (New England) it&#39;s <br/>\ncommon for towns to build a rink on the town green for people to use <br/>\n(they build a perimeter then flood it with a firehose and let it <br/>\nfreeze). Lakes and ponds are free (just make sure they&#39;re also <br/>\nsafe). Also check with relatives and friends to see if they have <br/>\nskates they aren&#39;t using, if they know of places that are <br/>\ninexpensive to skate indoors, and so on. Sometimes town parks & rec <br/>\ndepartments will have beginner skating lessons pretty inexpensively <br/>\nfor town residents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; horseback riding<br/>\n </span></blockquote>trade stable labor for riding lessons for one idea and I&#39;m sure <br/>\nother folks who are into riding will have other ideas. Maybe trade <br/>\nchildcare for the instructor with lessons for your horse enthusiast. <br/>\nor housework. or baked goods. whatever. Barter!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea in all of this is that there are more ways than just <br/>\nstraight out paying new money for brand new things. A life of <br/>\nabundance can happen with very little money.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Budgeting and Unschooling...","postDate":"1156293799","msgId":16657,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MjIxNzQzZ2RjZTcyMTFsOGJmZTVkZDBlYjU3MGUxMEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2MS42NzY0NmMuMzIxY2Q3NTRAYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGM2MS42NzY0NmMuMzIxY2Q3NTRAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16650,"nextInTopic":16661,"prevInTime":16656,"nextInTime":16658,"topicId":16601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The amount of fun and learning is NOT proportional to the <br/>\nmoney spent on the activity. The time you actively spend with your <br/>\nkids is more important than the amount of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also look for bargains and freebies everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Hi!<br/>\n&gt;I am curious how other unschoolers manage to allow their children to<br/>\n&gt;pursue their interests while not spending a fortune.

If you sent your<br/>\nkids to school you would be buying school clothes supplies, pictures,<br/>\ncupcakes, books from fundraisers, and all sorts of things.   Unschooling<br/>\nisn&#39;t cheap but it&#39;s far more rewarding to spend money on things your kids<br/>\nwant and use than it is on school related stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;d rather spend money on things we like to do than expensive clothing or<br/>\nfundraiser junk.  Also, you need to think outside the box sometimes.  While<br/>\nriding lessons seemed out of our budget at one time, really looking into it<br/>\nI found we could take them as frequently  or infrequently as we wanted.  You<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to be able to afford them weekly at most barns around here.<br/>\nWe&#39;re willing workers too and that helps at some places where they&#39;ll reduce<br/>\nthe cost of lessons in exchange for work. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it all boils down to talking with other people who love the same<br/>\nthings you love and see what you can work out in order to be exposed to that<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267882984,"authorName":"cmcchess","from":"&quot;cmcchess&quot; &lt;queen30@...&gt;","profile":"cmcchess","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Budgeting and Unschooling...","postDate":"1156100383","msgId":16601,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVjYWJldithYWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16602,"prevInTime":16600,"nextInTime":16602,"topicId":16601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!
