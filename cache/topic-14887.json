They did start to show some improvement after my mom signed <br/>\nthem up for the Big Brother program. Unfortunately, there aren&#39;t always a <br/>\nlot of guys who want to be a part of this program so it&#39;s understaffed in <br/>\nmany cities.

I&#39;m so sorry that it&#39;s <br/>\nhappening to you and to Connor!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the very, very best thing you can do for Connor is to listen <br/>\ndeeply to him, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been doing.  I know for me, when <br/>\nI&#39;m going through something that&#39;s really hard to bear, it&#39;s powerful <br/>\nto me to have someone else just acknowledge my struggle.  Hearing <br/>\n&quot;Wow, that&#39;s really tough stuff you&#39;re going through&quot; somehow makes <br/>\nme feel so much better.  When life sucks, just knowing that someone <br/>\nelse sees it, too, is a balm for me.  What I really hate, though, is <br/>\nfor someone to tell me what I should do (I&#39;m not saying that you do <br/>\nthis, though).  I feel like the advice-giver thinks me an incompetent <br/>\nfool (which may very well be true, but I&#39;d prefer to be the only one <br/>\nwho thinks that, especially when I&#39;m already smarting!).  I really <br/>\ndon&#39;t want someone else to fix things for me (unless, of course, it&#39;s <br/>\nmy car).  I can and would rather fix my life myself and in my own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing that this is what you already do for Connor:  Listen to <br/>\nhim, acknowledge his struggle, and love him in as big a way as he&#39;s <br/>\nwilling to accept, even when he&#39;s saying ugly things.  To me, all <br/>\nthis falls under the I-can-only-control-myself-and-no-one-else <br/>\nprinciple.  You can&#39;t make his dad toe the line, and you can&#39;t make <br/>\nConnor feel okay about being blown off by his dad.  All you can <br/>\nreally do (I think) is control how you respond to Connor&#39;s pain and <br/>\nsorrow and allow him to have a safe place to vent his deepest <br/>\nfeelings, when and if that&#39;s what he wants to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I wouldn&#39;t do is engage or participate in any <br/>\ndad-bashing, which you&#39;re probably not doing, either.  Neither would <br/>\nI cut off any of Connor&#39;s expressions of dad-bashing; I&#39;d just listen <br/>\nattentively, and if it got to any dad-bashing, I&#39;d listen and then <br/>\ngently bring the discussion back (eventually) to Connor and my <br/>\nacknowledgement of his struggle and feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy, that&#39;s a mighty tough scene you&#39;ve got there.  I&#39;m guessing <br/>\nthat the wise folks on this list will have other ideas to contribute <br/>\nthat I didn&#39;t even think of.  That&#39;s what I love about this <br/>\nlist!!
