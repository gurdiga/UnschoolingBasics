We&#39;ll meet at Rock Creek just like last year for a picnic, swimming and general fun on July 24th at noon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOvernight guests should check out the Comfort Inn as it&#39;s conveniently located and inexpensive. Earthfare is just down the road too!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlan on bringing food, drinks, swimming gear etc...  There is hiking available, bbq pits and bathrooms/changing areas. There is a $2 day fee when you get to the park (self service payment as you drive in) so bring a bit of cash.  See you there!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny questions, write me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40733,"nextTopicId":40661}}
