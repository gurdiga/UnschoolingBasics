Avoid talking about your choices. Avoid <br/>\ntalking about  theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\n <br/>\nI have run into this a bit.  In a way, it is like not discussing  religion or <br/>\npolitics with people that are your friends but hold different  beliefs.  My <br/>\nsocial group where I live are nice enough people, but mostly  into coercive <br/>\nparenting and schooling.  They currently have no desire to do  differently.  I <br/>\njust don&#39;t talk about parenting with them and if the  subject comes up, I change <br/>\nthe subject or find a reason to do something else  (got to check on the <br/>\nkids!).  <br/>\n <br/>\nIf asked directly, I will talk about it, but that almost never  happens.  I <br/>\nusually say something like &quot;I&#39;ve found what works for  us!&quot;  I learned to <br/>\nvalidate my children, and I&#39;ve learned to talk to my  friends in a non-judgmental <br/>\nway.  &quot;Oh, that must be hard for you that Susie  is flunking math, I hope that <br/>\nworks out well for everyone.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen people are ready, they will ask.  I nursed my children for a long  time, <br/>\nand I was always supportive of my friend&#39;s choices to wean.  Later,  more <br/>\nthan one person told me that my example was what led them to nurse into  <br/>\ntoddlerhood, even though they had weaned earlier babies.  Sometimes, people  just need <br/>\nto know things are possible.....hey, Leslie has great kids and she  isn&#39;t <br/>\nalways yelling at them....maybe I could learn how to do that, too.   Leslie <br/>\nhomeschools her children and they seem fine, maybe I could do that,  too.<br/>\n <br/>\nI try not to think of myself as &quot;superior&quot;.  I believe we are all here  <br/>\nlearning what we are supposed to be learning.  But, of course, anytime you  make a <br/>\ndeliberate choice, you are intentionally making the &quot;better&quot; choice for  you.  <br/>\nSo it is a little mixed up!  And since we are trying to be  better parents, <br/>\nthat does make us better than someone who is doing the same old  thing.  But I <br/>\n*have* to be here doing this, it is the only thing that made  sense to me.  My <br/>\ndrive to be a better parent is undeniable!   Someone else whose drive is to <br/>\nmake the environment clean might feel superior to  me.  That&#39;s cool, I&#39;m glad <br/>\nthey are doing their thing.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, do what is right for you and your kids.  You might find your group  of <br/>\nfriends changing a bit.  That is OK.  Wish them well, you might be  their <br/>\ninspiration to be a better parent.  :) <br/>\n <br/>\nOh, and come here when you want to talk about how amazing unschooling life  <br/>\nis!<br/>\n <br/>\nTake care, Leslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":30983993,"authorName":"Lesa","from":"&quot;Lesa&quot; &lt;lesajm@...&gt;","profile":"lesamlowe","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] superiority","postDate":"1159902495","msgId":17818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExOS1EQVY3MzEwNkEyQTNFMjYzMEM4QUQxRjVEMzFDMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEwMDMxMTUybTU0NTQwMDJmaTgyODhmOTk3ZWZiMTRkMThAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17816,"nextInTopic":17831,"prevInTime":17817,"nextInTime":17819,"topicId":17684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... unschooling and think that it is wonderful and idealistic but would never attempt to unschool (themselves or their children) because it wasn t the status","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-103619394\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve met quite a few people who will listen to the theory of\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling and think that it is wonderful and &quot;idealistic&quot; but would\r<br/>\nnever attempt to unschool (themselves or their children) because it\r<br/>\nwasn&#39;t the status quo.

I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1567685029\">In my forty-some years, I have found it&#39;s best to keep my mouth shut about the choices I make (but fail to take my own advise since I&#39;m speaking , lol).  I nursed my first born for the first four months of her life.  I worked full-time and had to express at work.  The men were all kind and supportive.  The ladies mean and vicious and extremely rude.  The doctor told me to stop due to the large amount of hair I was shedding.  He said it was due to stress.  What persuaded me the most, was the hair was everywhere.  When I started to have to untwine it from my daughters fingers, I was done.  Fast forward seven years.  When I had my son, I was lucky enough to be a stay home mom. I nursed him for eighteen months.  Talk about people getting in your business.  Understand, he was naturally weaning and down to one feeding at like five am.  People really don&#39;t like when you do things &#39;different&#39; then the crowd.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  My own niece and nephew tried insulting my kids over the fact, they felt they where superior to my kids as they went to private school.  Funny.  My kids were also in private school.  Later, my sister-in-law learned that her kids had actually been behind the public school system.  I had switched my kids into the middle school gifted.  My oldest is now taking six college level courses in eleventh grade.  We also no longer socialize with them as their kids continue to try to act superior and my kids want nothing to do with them because of this.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The path my oldest is taking (currently learning her fourth language) is right for her but completely wrong for her sister, who is very musical.  Both girls thrive in public school with lots of friends.  My son?  Three years of trying three different school types has lead to homeschooling and unschooling.  He is back to being a happy kid.  My eight year old is a reader.  He reads everything he can get his hands on.  He has a high IQ and is a quick learner.  I found that it&#39;s best not to mention what he&#39;s learning when we get together with other homeschoolers.  It&#39;s best (for us) to just get together for the friendship and avoid comparisons as that prevents anyone from feeling challenged, superior, or better-then-thou.  I made the mistake of asking if my son could join the homeschool chess group (for 11+) and got snubbed for the effort.  The fact that he has been playing for years and is rather good, did not make up for the fact he is numerically challenged.  Go figure.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Well, I don&#39;t know if this answers your question.  Even in my own home, people all have opinions on how things should be done.  My spouse is against &quot;unschooling&quot; even though it works well.  He was also against ever sending the youngest to school. My linguists thinks her brother will become a freak homeschooler and should just go to public school and learn to fight.  My musical one, (my favorite opinion) says it&#39;s better for him not to have to suffer what he did in school and when he&#39;s ready to go back, if ever, he will ask.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n  Hi again,<br/>\n<br/>\nthere is another question I asked on the AU List, but I didn&#39;t get <br/>\nmany answers. I dunno if it was unwelcome or just drowned by so many <br/>\nother postings (it&#39;s too much for me, I quit for the moment! :-)) and <br/>\nif it is unwelcome here then just disregard (though maybe tell me <br/>\nit&#39;s unwelcome so I know :-)) And since nothing has been going on <br/>\nhere the past few days you are surely all eager to finally reply to <br/>\n*something* so here it comes ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time letting my friends know that I don&#39;t feel <br/>\n&quot;superior&quot; just because I choose unschooling, on the other hand <br/>\nknowing for myself that I can only do what I think is &quot;best&quot; for my <br/>\nchildren and that I of course will choose this if I think it is <br/>\n&quot;better&quot; than other &quot;methods&quot; (though I feel that unschooling is not <br/>\nreally a &quot;method&quot;). But my friend insist (and I feel that she has a <br/>\npoint there somehow) that I was saying that I&#39;m superior <br/>\n(&quot;supermom&quot;), because &quot;raising our kids with love and respect&quot; is <br/>\nsomething she says she is *of course* doing, even though she chooses <br/>\ncoercive methods; but that I, or unschoolers in general, by saying <br/>\nthat our relationships with our children will (probably, as a side <br/>\neffect) turn out to be *more* respectful, that they trust *more* and <br/>\nthat they will be *happier* and that our kids are &quot;free&quot; (implying <br/>\nthat all other kids are &quot;in prison&quot; which of course is bad) quite <br/>\ngives the impression as though we felt superior. Just *accepting* or <br/>\n*tolerating* that others choose different things doesn&#39;t mean we <br/>\nthink what they&#39;re doing is &quot;equally right&quot; than what we are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we avoid feeling this ourselves and far worse, that our <br/>\nchildren grow up with this feeling of superiority (my parents did the <br/>\nbest, we are doing the &quot;best&quot; kind of education.. being &quot;too&quot; self- <br/>\nconfident)? Or maybe my question is, how can I avoid thinking that <br/>\n*I*&#39;m superior just because I choose unschooling? How do you avoid it <br/>\n is there a need to avoid it at all? Can you all say for yourself <br/>\nthat you *really* don&#39;t think unschooling is &quot;better&quot;, thus, you are <br/>\nkind of &quot;superior&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is always a bad thing! It&#39;s just that people don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to hear that other people feel superior than they are. We all <br/>\nchoose to live (or should choose to live) the way we think is &quot;best&quot; <br/>\nfor us. And this same issue arises when it comes to religions, people <br/>\nchoose a religion and stick to it because they feel it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; or <br/>\n&quot;superior&quot;(?) than others. If it didn&#39;t really matter, because all <br/>\nreligions are &quot;equal&quot; then we could choose whatever, maybe switching <br/>\neach day! I feel like &quot;of course I do what *I* find &quot;best&quot; and I <br/>\nexplicitly *don&#39;t* live by different principles, because *of course* <br/>\nI find them inferior. Why would I choose something I don&#39;t like/find <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot;? you know what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it wrong at all to feel superior, as long as we don&#39;t try to <br/>\nimpose our values onto others? Does not everyone who is confident <br/>\nwith what he&#39;s doing feel kind of &quot;better&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere am I thinking wrong? (I kind of don&#39;t feel OK thinking that <br/>\nway, as I said I have a hard time saying I&#39;m not superior, at the <br/>\nsame time feeling it a tiny bit o:-) )<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to say...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

It&#39;s  <br/>\nlike when someone is saying he knows &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; about all what life  <br/>\nis or God or religion. Who can know really what is &quot;best&quot; and what is  <br/>\n&quot;the truth&quot;. I&#39;m not convinced that people who are &quot;hurt&quot; by what  <br/>\nunschooling says, are &quot;actually only hurt because deep inside they  <br/>\nknow that what they are doing is wrong&quot;. I think some of them might  <br/>\nbe really convinced that what they are doing is best for their  <br/>\nchildren and their family but just don&#39;t like the &quot;arrogant&quot;  <br/>\nbehaviour of people who dare to talk as though they were superior.  <br/>\nThey like to think – and I like to think – that we all are equal...  <br/>\nsomething like that :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Then they can change and be better.

I don&#39;t think they FEEL inferiour, they just don&#39;t like people  <br/>\nwho feel superior – I hope you see the difference! It makes us kind  <br/>\nof arrogant – daring to say we are doing it better (&quot;I&#39;m a better  <br/>\nparent than you are&quot; is something that nobody would really say  <br/>\nbecause... I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just unfriendly, disrespectful? but by  <br/>\ntalking about unschooling we sort of imply that we are better parents  <br/>\nso we say it anyway!)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Step OUT of the socialist box! &lt;G&gt; Some things ARE better than others.<br/>\n&gt; You feel guilty for having chosen a better path?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, for feeling superior although I can&#39;t say for sure I am – who  <br/>\nknows? How can you face someone you think is inferiour to yourself  <br/>\nand not feel strange? I don&#39;t like to be with people who are or who  <br/>\nthink they are superior to me unless I admire them so much. I  don&#39;t  <br/>\nlike it because it feels strange, I cannot explain. Maybe because I  <br/>\nfeel they won&#39;t respect any of what I might have to say. And just as  <br/>\ni want to respect my children&#39;s choices I want to respect all of  <br/>\nother people&#39;s choices but how can I then? How can I NOT make people  <br/>\nfeel uncomfortable around me just because I think I&#39;m &quot;better&quot; – I  <br/>\ncannot be that from now on, I can only surround myself with people  <br/>\nwho think the same as I do!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Shed the guilt.

I dunno if it was unwelcome or just drowned by so many  <br/>\nother postings (it&#39;s too much for me, I quit for the moment! :-)) and  <br/>\nif it is unwelcome here then just disregard (though maybe tell me  <br/>\nit&#39;s unwelcome so I know :-)) And since nothing has been going on  <br/>\nhere the past few days you are surely all eager to finally reply to  <br/>\n*something* so here it comes ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a hard time letting my friends know that I don&#39;t feel  <br/>\n&quot;superior&quot; just because I choose unschooling, on the other hand  <br/>\nknowing for myself that I can only do what I think is &quot;best&quot; for my  <br/>\nchildren and that I of course will choose this if I think it is  <br/>\n&quot;better&quot; than other &quot;methods&quot; (though I feel that unschooling is not  <br/>\nreally a &quot;method&quot;). But my friend insist (and I feel that she has a  <br/>\npoint there somehow) that I was saying that I&#39;m superior  <br/>\n(&quot;supermom&quot;), because &quot;raising our kids with love and respect&quot; is  <br/>\nsomething she says she is *of course* doing, even though she chooses  <br/>\ncoercive methods; but that I, or unschoolers in general, by saying  <br/>\nthat our relationships with our children will (probably, as a side  <br/>\neffect) turn out to be *more* respectful, that they trust *more* and  <br/>\nthat they will be *happier* and that our kids are &quot;free&quot; (implying  <br/>\nthat all other kids are &quot;in prison&quot; which of course is bad) quite  <br/>\ngives the impression as though we felt superior. Just *accepting* or  <br/>\n*tolerating* that others choose different things doesn&#39;t mean we  <br/>\nthink what they&#39;re doing is &quot;equally right&quot; than what we are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we avoid feeling this ourselves and far worse, that our  <br/>\nchildren grow up with this feeling of superiority (my parents did the  <br/>\nbest, we are doing the &quot;best&quot; kind of education.. being &quot;too&quot; self- <br/>\nconfident)? Or maybe my question is, how can I avoid thinking that  <br/>\n*I*&#39;m superior just because I choose unschooling? How do you avoid it  <br/>\n– is there a need to avoid it at all? Can you all say for yourself  <br/>\nthat you *really* don&#39;t think unschooling is &quot;better&quot;, thus, you are  <br/>\nkind of &quot;superior&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think this is always a bad thing! It&#39;s just that people don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to hear that other people feel superior than they are. We all  <br/>\nchoose to live (or should choose to live) the way we think is &quot;best&quot;  <br/>\nfor us. And this same issue arises when it comes to religions, people  <br/>\nchoose a religion and stick to it because they feel it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;superior&quot;(?) than others. If it didn&#39;t really matter, because all  <br/>\nreligions are &quot;equal&quot; then we could choose whatever, maybe switching  <br/>\neach day! I feel like &quot;of course I do what *I* find &quot;best&quot; and I  <br/>\nexplicitly *don&#39;t* live by different principles, because *of course*  <br/>\nI find them inferior. Why would I choose something I don&#39;t like/find  <br/>\n&quot;wrong&quot;? you know what I mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it wrong at all to feel superior, as long as we don&#39;t try to  <br/>\nimpose our values onto others? Does not everyone who is confident  <br/>\nwith what he&#39;s doing feel kind of &quot;better&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere am I thinking wrong? (I kind of don&#39;t feel OK thinking that  <br/>\nway, as I said I have a hard time saying I&#39;m not superior, at the  <br/>\nsame time feeling it a tiny bit o:-) )<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to say...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18220,"nextTopicId":18171}}
