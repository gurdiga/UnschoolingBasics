So he started the game that gets more<br/>\nnumbers.  2+2 is his turn and my turn is to say 4, 4+4 he says, I say 8, and<br/>\nwe kept on doubling numbers.  He was feeling pretty happy once he got to say<br/>\none thousand twenty four, at which point he asked me to repeat the answer<br/>\nfor him so he could say 1024 +1024.

The boy can <br/>\nlook at a simple algebra problem and see the numbers and why they go <br/>\nwhere. I just do the steps to &quot;solve&quot; it. Before unschooling (BU?) I was <br/>\ntrying to get him to learn &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;prepare for when the <br/>\nproblems get harder&quot; and was trying to get him to do math the way I was <br/>\ntaught. So of course he went from loving math to finding it boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are still deschooling so I may not even try exploring math for awhile <br/>\nbut I want to explore better ways to suggest it to them when they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n-- <br/>\nThink you can&#39;t afford solar--Think Again! check out:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jointhesolution.com/livinggaia\">http://www.jointhesolution.com/livinggaia</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34790,"nextTopicId":34782}}
