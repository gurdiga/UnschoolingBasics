I knew something was<br/>\nwrong far earlier, but the ped neurologist had told me<br/>\nmy son would &quot;grow out of it.&quot; Autism was never<br/>\nmentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter he was diagnosed, the doctor felt putting my son<br/>\non ritalin would be good. It wasn&#39;t... quite the<br/>\nopposite. When ritalin didn&#39;t work, the doctor just<br/>\nwanted to keep trying med after med after med. I<br/>\ndecided my son wasn&#39;t going to be a guinea pig and<br/>\nthat I would seek out an option that was healthy, not<br/>\nharmful. I discovered the GFCF diet.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe never had my son tested, per se. We removed certain<br/>\nfoods for a test period. Then allow an &quot;infraction&quot;<br/>\nand watch him to see if there was a reaction. Gluten<br/>\nmade him react with autistic behaviors, as well as<br/>\npotato. Soy makes him super-hyper. Diary makes him<br/>\nsick to his stomach. No one needs artificial colors<br/>\nand flavors, so I never bothered to &quot;test&quot; that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, my younger son is not on the GFCF diet, neither<br/>\nmy husband or myself. My autistic son never complains<br/>\nabout what he can&#39;t eat. I try to explain to him that<br/>\nit will make him sick to eat these foods. Then I make<br/>\nfoods for him that are as close to normal as I can get<br/>\nthem. Pancakes, blueberry muffins, flour tortillas,<br/>\nhot pretzels, etc. And I grill a lot too... shish<br/>\nkabobs, garlic chicken, pork chops. Plus he loves<br/>\nfresh fruit and veggies. He eats far healthier than<br/>\nanyone else in my house, and he honestly doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nlike cookies, brownies, cake, or even chocolate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d like to say that he knows that the<br/>\ngluten/dairy/etc make him feel sick, but with his<br/>\nautism, it&#39;s hard for him to tell me things like that.<br/>\nI try to let him be as free as he can be within his<br/>\ndiet. And as I said, he&#39;s adapted very well and really<br/>\nnever asks for anything he can&#39;t have. I&#39;ve been most<br/>\nfortunate. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nIt&#39;s here!
