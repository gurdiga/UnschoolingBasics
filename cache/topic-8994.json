American high school students fizzle in international<br/>\ncomparisons, placing well behind countries, even poorer countries like<br/>\nPoland, the Czech Republic and South Korea. American kids do pretty<br/>\nwell when they enter public school, but as time goes on, the worse<br/>\nthey do. Why? School officials complain that they need more money, but<br/>\nas John Stossel reports, most of the countries that outperform us<br/>\nspend less per student than we do. There are many factors that<br/>\ncontribute to failure in school, but according to some, foremost is<br/>\nthe government&#39;s monopoly over the school system, which means that<br/>\nmost parents don&#39;t get to choose where to send their children. In<br/>\nother countries, choice fosters competition, and competition improves<br/>\nperformance. Stossel questions government officials, union leaders,<br/>\nparents and students. He also examines how the educational system can<br/>\nbe improved upon and reports on innovative programs across the<br/>\ncountry. &quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; with John<br/>\nStossel airs on FRIDAY, JANUARY 13 (10:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC<br/>\nTelevision Network.<br/>\n<br/>\n So are American students stupid? &quot;No, we&#39;re not stupid...but we just,<br/>\nwe could do better,&quot; says one high school student. Another tells<br/>\nStossel, &quot;I think it has to be something with the school, &#39;cause I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think we&#39;re stupider...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Stossel questions how much success there can be under a government<br/>\nmonopoly school system. Kevin Chavous, Former D.C. City Councilman and<br/>\nEducation Reformer, tells Stossel the schools will never improve<br/>\nunless there is competition, &quot;[with] all the well intended designs and<br/>\nprograms du jours, unless there is some competition infused in the<br/>\nequation...., then...they know they have a captive monopoly that they<br/>\ncan continue to dominate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n School officials complain they need more money, but do they really?<br/>\nAmerican schools spend about $10,000 per student, totaling $250,000<br/>\nplus for a class of 25. Where does that money go? Stossel asks South<br/>\nCarolina school official Dolores Wright, &quot;How much money would be<br/>\nright?&quot; Wright answers, &quot;...Oooh. Millions. And it would really make<br/>\nit right...The more, the better.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n Some say another stumbling block is that the public school system is<br/>\na union dominated monopoly. In Stossel&#39;s hometown of New York City, a<br/>\nteacher who sent sexual e-mails to his 16 year old student was not<br/>\nfired because the union&#39;s rigid contract makes it very hard to fire<br/>\nany teacher, even dangerous ones. Only after six years of expensive<br/>\nlitigation were they finally able to fire him. Joel Klein, Chancellor<br/>\nof New York City&#39;s schools, tells Stossel, &quot;I mean we&#39;ve had sex<br/>\ncases. Acknowledged sex cases... you can&#39;t fire him.&quot; The teachers<br/>\nunion has so many protections written into the contract to make sure<br/>\nprincipals don&#39;t fire unfairly, or play favorites, that principals<br/>\nrarely even try to jump through all these hoops to try to fire a bad<br/>\nteacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stossel shows how well students do in Belgium&#39;s free school choice<br/>\nsystem -- because the money is attached to the student, the principal<br/>\nhas to please the parents. And that makes a world of difference. ABC<br/>\nNews gave part of an international test to students in Belgium and<br/>\nstudents in New Jersey. The Belgian students did much better than the<br/>\nNew Jersey students.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stossel offers that American kids deserve the benefits of competition<br/>\ntoo, to give them access to schools that are as good as the other<br/>\nproducts and services we have in life. Yet the system does not allow<br/>\nparents and kids a choice - in most states children can only attend<br/>\nthe public school for which they are zoned. Kids of the privileged can<br/>\nescape the bad school because they can afford to move to good school<br/>\nzones, or attend private schools. Stossel visits South Carolina, whose<br/>\nGovernor wanted to change that but got voted down by other politicians<br/>\nand public educators.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;0/20&quot; is anchored by Elizabeth Vargas and John Stossel.
