His<br/>\ntalk will be a delicious exploration of what Gatto calls open source<br/>\nlearning.I imagine we can expect the same level of insight and seriously<br/>\nthought-provoking material from his talk as we have been exposed to in his<br/>\nwriting.  If you have never read his stuff,  you are missing out on some<br/>\namazing ideas! The author of Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of<br/>\nCompulsory Schooling (1992); The Exhausted School (1993); A Different Kind<br/>\nof Teacher (2000); and The Underground History Of American Education (2001),<br/>\nhe just released Weapons of Mass Instruction, his latest book. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMr. Gatto&#39;s visit with us is really just a nice surprise for all of us who<br/>\nwill be attending.It was actually a bit of a surprise to the organizers J.we<br/>\nweren&#39;t sure if we could make it happen BUT WE DID!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nHe joins a wonderful and dazzling lineup of presenters which includes Dayna<br/>\nMartin, Amy Childs, Erika Davis-Pitre and Cameron Lovejoy among others.Of<br/>\ncourse these folks are the HEART of our gathering and we are just feeling<br/>\nlike we&#39;ve got an amazing blend of experiences in store for everyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are also adding to our participant-led funshop list every day..We&#39;ve got<br/>\nballoon rooms, serious paper airplane making, designing your own blue jeans,<br/>\na gaming room, knitting, an ATC funshop and more are being added every week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the rate we are going, we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we far exceeded our<br/>\noriginal vision for attendance (yippee!)  Don&#39;t delay in purchasing your<br/>\nlodging if you have a particular lodging option in mind and you don&#39;t want<br/>\nto let it get away..Registration and meal plan deadline is still 3/28 at<br/>\nmidnight. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSee you all soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer Johnson, organizer,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Big Happy Life Unschoolers Conference Retreat<br/>\n<br/>\nApril 28-May 1, 2009 Lebanon NJ<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.greatbighappylife.com<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38497,"nextTopicId":38384}}
