There&#39;s something about seeing those<br/>\nmountains and reading &quot;You are loved. All is well.&quot; that helps center<br/>\nme. There&#39;s a different quote every day. You can sign up to get the<br/>\nquotes by e-mail, too, but I like seeing those mountains. Today&#39;s<br/>\nquote is:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children desire freedom! And every particle of their being from<br/>\ntheir Source says, &quot;You are free. You are so free, that every thought<br/>\nyou offer, the entire Universe jumps to respond to it.&quot; And so, to<br/>\ntake that kind of knowledge and try to confine it in any way, defies<br/>\nthe Laws of the Universe. You must allow your children to be free,<br/>\nbecause the entire Universe is set up to accommodate that. And<br/>\nanything you do to the contrary will only bring you regret. You cannot<br/>\ncontain those that cannot be contained. It defies Law.  --- Abraham<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to know I&#39;m flowing *with* the Universe. I can feel it!<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28917,"nextTopicId":28950}}
