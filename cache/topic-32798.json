I can t think of a single group","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-646405075\">I am having a hard time understanding why someone who is so interested <br/>\nin &quot;critical thinking&quot; would choose to believe schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t think of a single group of people who think more critically <br/>\nthan unschoolers. Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling parents I know virtually as well as IRL think HARD <br/>\nabout the choices they make. Every day. They&#39;ve made very difficult <br/>\nchoices regarding learning after MUCH consideration and questioning and <br/>\nthought. Often it leads further than simply academics, and it causes <br/>\nthe families to think beyond---into religion and eating and chores and <br/>\nbedtimes and ....and the whole lifestyle. WHY we do what we do. WHY we <br/>\nbehave as we do. WHY we think as we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestioning one thing leads to questioning others.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t accept &quot;because I said so&quot; as an answer. Neither should anyone <br/>\nelse.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people seem to want research---as if research will answer their <br/>\nquestions. Research only answers the questions the researchers are <br/>\nlooking for. What I want to see is how it affects TWO people---MY <br/>\nchildren. It just so happens that unschooling and mindful parenting <br/>\nworks for every family that embraces it. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s <br/>\nimportant to me. What&#39;s important is Cameron and Duncan. Only. I have <br/>\ncan see the difference in them. That&#39;s enough for *me*.<br/>\n<br/>\nMillion of parents send their children every day to schools, not <br/>\nquestioning ONE thing the schools say or do. They require homework and <br/>\nearly bedtimes and limit games and TV because schools and teachers and <br/>\neducators say so---never asking why or whether it&#39;s important. They <br/>\naccept that what schools require is necessary---often because it <br/>\njustifies the parents&#39; own time in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers are the only group which *critically* questions the status <br/>\nquo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you can think critically and yet still choose to send a <br/>\nchild to school. That defies logic. There is NOTHING in school that <br/>\ncannot be found in the real world---and PLENTY in the real world that <br/>\ncannot be found in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my children&#39;s worlds to be so much bigger than *any* school <br/>\ncould pretend to be. And I&#39;ve though a LOT about this.
