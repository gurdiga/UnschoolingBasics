One of those heartwarming moments, again, and from<br/>\na mom who doesn&#39;t require chores. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s really sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a dishes story from yesterday too. It&#39;s not as nice as yours.<br/>\nAfter I got off work, the house was a TOTAL wreck (dh was distracted<br/>\nby tax stuff so not as available) and I wanted to get ready for Easter<br/>\ncompany.  I started cleaning the kitchen area and asked Sierra and<br/>\nJared to PLEASE help out because I was a bit overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSierra jumped right up, but wanted to handwash dishes. I was starting<br/>\nto get agitated anyway, because Jared was sitting and watching me<br/>\nclean like a madwoman and not doing a thing (those damn expectations<br/>\ngetting in the way again).  I explained to Sierra that I just wanted<br/>\nthe counters cleared and handwashing was NOT an option right at that<br/>\nmoment (brilliant Ren).<br/>\nShe was pissed off and left. If she couldn&#39;t handwash, she wasn&#39;t<br/>\ngoing to help. Argh.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I got some stuff done, grumped about not getting enough help (smack<br/>\nmy forehead here!!) and Jared started helping. <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing about him, he truly just doesn&#39;t notice sometimes. He<br/>\nwasn&#39;t trying to be unhelpful (he&#39;s a very sweet guy) he was just<br/>\nthinking about other things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo later on, when we&#39;re trying to wind the night down, I&#39;m feeling<br/>\nguilty for not letting Sierra handwash the dishes and being a general<br/>\njerk.<br/>\nI cleaned up and all the dishes that didn&#39;t fit in the dishwasher got<br/>\nsaved for her.:)  I filled up the sink with warm, soapy water and<br/>\nhollered &quot;Sierra, you want to wash dishes now?&quot;<br/>\nShe came running and happily stood washing the whole  pile.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs she washed, she says &quot;Mom,I wonder why some people love to wash<br/>\ndishes?&quot;  I laughed and told her the story of Dylan and Deb (also<br/>\nshared it on my conference CD) and I was glad she liked helping me so<br/>\nmuch.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI felt a bit of redemption at that point and told her I was sorry for<br/>\nbeing grumpy earlier.  I guess the whole point of this rambling story<br/>\nis that help does not always come in the form we think it should. But<br/>\nif we honor their efforts and embrace whatever form of help we get,<br/>\nkids are totally willing to be part of our household tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe not all of them (who on earth likes ALL of them?) but that&#39;s ok.<br/>\nJalen loves helping me fold laundry...go figure.  It&#39;s still one of my<br/>\nleast favorite chores because my Mom was SUCH a bitch about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe folds in his own unique way (as a five year old would)and loves<br/>\nhauling laundry to it&#39;s home. It never looks super neat. But he&#39;s<br/>\nenjoying an activity with me. Who cares if they even get folded?<br/>\nThey&#39;re clean and put away right?:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"intro/concerns","postDate":"1145191394","msgId":12090,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxdGU1MitkbWNpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12093,"prevInTime":12089,"nextInTime":12091,"topicId":12090,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On the rare occasion that we re having a special treat, say coffee I explain to her that it s something grown-ups drink that s not very really healthy and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-360049923\">&quot;On the rare occasion that we&#39;re having a<br/>\nspecial treat, say coffee I explain to her that it&#39;s something grown-ups<br/>\ndrink that&#39;s not very really healthy and when she gets older she&#39;s welcome<br/>\nto try it. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf coffee is truly unhealthy, then no one should drink it.
