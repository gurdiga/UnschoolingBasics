Lauren went into her room and woke<br/>\nher up at 6:15, earlier than she usually gets up for school.  So then she<br/>\ncame into my room and announced that she wanted to go to school today after<br/>\nall.  I said she made her decision last night and since she stayed up so<br/>\nlate, I didn&#39;t want her to go.  She burst into tears (as she always does<br/>\nwhen she doesn&#39;t get exactly what she wants, regardless of the legality or<br/>\npossibility of it), so I promised we would do something fun today.  She was<br/>\nslightly mollified and an hour or so later she asked if we could go for a<br/>\nlong car ride today.  We had breakfast, then loaded the van to take the<br/>\ntrash to the dump.  We had never driven the road beyond the dump, so we went<br/>\nfor an &quot;adventure&quot; via the back roads we had never explored before.  Our ten<br/>\nminute errand took over an hour.  We saw some pretty neat houses and views.<br/>\nWe stopped at the store on the way home to pick up something for lunch, and<br/>\nDH also bought a couple bottles of soda and three bags of chips.  When we<br/>\ngot home it was about 10:30.  Lauren asked for something to eat so I started<br/>\nto make her a sandwich.  She noticed the chips and asked if she could have<br/>\nsome.  I said yes and opened the bag for her.  I finished her sandwich and<br/>\ngave it to her.  She carried everything into the living room and put her<br/>\nsandwich on the couch, where she temporarily forgot about it while she ate<br/>\nher chips.  Rowan found the sandwich and took the top piece of bread and one<br/>\nslice of ham and began mowing down in the kitchen.  Lauren bemoaned her<br/>\nmutilated sandwich, then finished it (without my saying anything), then she<br/>\nand I went to our appointment with the preschool coordinator and special<br/>\neducation team to determine her eligibility for services.  That was a<br/>\nhorrible experience.  She had fun playing in the classroom by herself during<br/>\nour meeting, but I was very unhappy with the process.  I had made it quite<br/>\nclear to her current play therapist that I did not want her to be coded, due<br/>\nto seeing what happened to my brothers in &quot;the system&quot;.  They said that they<br/>\nhad to code her in order to give her services, so I very reluctantly<br/>\nconceded.  I let them know that I would not need to send her to the<br/>\npreschool to get &quot;language role-models&quot; because I had just foud a local<br/>\nhomeschooling group that has regular playdates.  They were happy with that.<br/>\nWhen we got in the car to come home, Lauren asked if we were going home.  I<br/>\nsaid yes, and she said no, she wanted to go to the store.  I asked what she<br/>\nwanted at the store and she said she wanted soda.  I said that Daddy had<br/>\njust bought soda and pulled into the driveway.  She flipped out and insisted<br/>\nwe go to the store.  I turned the car back on and drove to Family Dollar and<br/>\ntook her in to buy a bottle of soda.  I gave her the money to pay for it<br/>\nherself and she was incredibly happy.  She waved that sales receipt around<br/>\nin such delight!  Then she was quite content to come home.  The first thing<br/>\nshe did upon coming in was to show Daddy her sales receipt.  :)  The kids<br/>\nasked for Jello and hard boiled eggs, both of which I began for them.  About<br/>\nhalf an hour later, she asked me to give her a nap, which I did.  DH and I<br/>\nstarted dinner to be ready at 4:30-5:00, 1.5 hours earlier than usual.  We<br/>\nmade shepherd&#39;s pie, which sent Lauren running from the table.  She doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike her food mixed up.  Moira ate a little, then took off to watch TV.  I<br/>\nfinished eating, then went to teach my GED class.  Just before I left, I<br/>\ngave Rowan to DH to give her a nap (she starts naps by sleeping on him).<br/>\nWhen I came home (after thinking of a great analogy for unschooling on the<br/>\nwalk home), the girls said, &quot;Yay, now we can have Jello!&quot;  Then I realized<br/>\nthat DH was still holding a napping Rowan, so was unable to get them<br/>\nanything while I was gone.  Moira ate probably an entire box of Jello (I<br/>\nmade a double batch), but Lauren wasn&#39;t too interested in it after she tried<br/>\nit.  They returned to the living room to watch more TV with Daddy.  Around<br/>\n8, we suggested they brush teeth and hair so they would be already for bed<br/>\nwhen they got tired.  Immediately after brushing, Lauren asked me to take<br/>\nher to bed.  I was dreading Moira staying up until 10:30 again and having to<br/>\nput her to bed because I wanted to go to bed.  But she started getting<br/>\ndroopy eyed aroud 9:30 and was slumping on DH, who suggested she go to bed.<br/>\nShe thought that was a good idea and took my hand and pulled me upstairs to<br/>\nread to her and sing her a song.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to make a long story short, we had a great time with Moira home.  They<br/>\nboth exercised far more self-discipline (what&#39;s a better word?) than I<br/>\nexpected.  I noticed that Lauren took less advantage of the freedom than<br/>\nMoira did.  Is that from 7 months in kindergarten?  Yikes.  After the<br/>\nfrustrating meeting with the SPED team and the wonderful day we had today, I<br/>\nam a believer.  Now I just have to formally take her out of school.  I feel<br/>\na little bad because the kindergarten class is the last grade to put on a<br/>\nconcert and it is scheduled for next Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nJudy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194903596,"authorName":"Ruth","from":"&quot;Ruth&quot; &lt;grayfamily9@...&gt;","profile":"ladybird579","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Staying home from school","postDate":"1110998334","msgId":5156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGQwMWM1MmE1NyQ2ODUxN2Y2MCRiNDlhNjQ1M0BwY2FiYTFkMzU1NTE5Zj4=","referencesHeader":"PGQuNDAzMmY2OTYuMmY2OWI3OTJAYW9sLmNvbT4gPDk2MTJkYWE3NzdkZDRkODE2NzVmYWVjNDA1N2M2ZTQzQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8NDIzODZDMEEuODAwMDcwMUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":5155,"nextInTopic":5162,"prevInTime":5155,"nextInTime":5157,"topicId":5150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Judy Sounds easier all round if she stops going altogether.
