I STRONGLY suggest you do  the same. It opened up my <br/>\neyes (I read almost all of it in a day, lol) to so  many ideas! And there are <br/>\nwonderful quizzes in there to help you see the  interests you have that you may <br/>\nnot be aware of. I usually am not into the  quizzes, but these were really, <br/>\ntruly helpful. If you can get your hands on  that, I&#39;d eat my hat if 1) I had <br/>\none ;) and 2) if it didn&#39;t help in some  powerful way. If you can&#39;t find or <br/>\nafford it, let me know.
