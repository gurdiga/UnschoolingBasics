I feel HEARD  <br/>\nand I needed that. It&#39;s been 1 month today since I&#39;ve seen her, and the  <br/>\nresponses I got are helping me keep it together and respond to her as I can. So  <br/>\nagain, a true, deep, heartfelt thanks to all of you - even those that did not  <br/>\nreply about my subject specifically, because I get SO much from each issue, each  <br/>\nconversation. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd...there was an AMAZING quote one of you had in a letter to me and I  also <br/>\nsaw in someone&#39;s sigg. I think...about basically taking the responsibility  <br/>\nfor being who we are...? Could someone kindly send me that again? I *need* it! <br/>\n <br/>\nI have more questions, but right now, I am absorbing my replies and  thinking <br/>\nand feeling. I have some stuff happening with Grace and her schooled  friends <br/>\n(so that last post about the girls and the camp scenario was SOOOOO  timely!) <br/>\nbut I&#39;ll get to that as I can. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again, all. <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25445,"nextTopicId":25560}}
