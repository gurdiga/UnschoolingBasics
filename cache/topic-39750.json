One has no money problems in old age and is quite happy and the other has nothing but money-related problems and is miserable and miserable to be around. The surprising part is that it is the one with more money who has all the problems. All brought on by her reactions to money/things issues, not the reality of her bank balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck sorting out a happy path for yourself! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t have much money when I was a kid,</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39740,"nextTopicId":39765}}
