She never learned to like <br/>\nreading until she was 25yo and had just delivered her first<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis young lady had dropped out of school at age 15, prior to <br/>\never setting foot into a high school.  After having her son, she <br/>\ndecided that she wanted to learn.  She wanted to read before her <br/>\nson did.  She went to the community college and had to take remedial <br/>\nclasses and such.  She earned her B.A. and her first real job is a <br/>\nteacher at the local public high school.   Her son just turned eight. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe has since married, had another child, and I must say, even though <br/>\nher path isn&#39;t mine.  She got where she wanted to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point?  There are many paths.  As parents, we should help our <br/>\nchildren find theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad my parents never thought about unschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22029,"nextTopicId":22074}}
