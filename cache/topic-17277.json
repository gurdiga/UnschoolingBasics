We have done attachment<br/>\n  parenting since birth and that and my daughter&#39;s own desire led us to<br/>\n  unschooling. I didn&#39;t want to spend 8 hours away from her and felt<br/>\n  that if she was going to be taught then I would be the best person to<br/>\n  do that. Now I feel that it is the opposite and she is my teacher and<br/>\n  I the student and that works pretty well. She just learns what she<br/>\n  wants to and the others follow suit. We have never done a curriculum<br/>\n  and we don&#39;t want to. We have just let her and our subsiquent children<br/>\n  just live in our lives an be completely present and welcome there. But<br/>\n  over the last 4 years I had been sinking deeper and deeper into a<br/>\n  terrible depression, winters are always harder. We moved to a<br/>\n  different house, in the city instead of in the country where I had<br/>\n  started to feel really isolated, we lived there for 5 years: 4 months<br/>\n  ago we moved and that helped a lot. And recently I found out that I<br/>\n  have severe hypothyroidism. So I am starting a holistic treatment plan<br/>\n  I had made for my mom last year when she was diagnosed and she<br/>\n  wouldn&#39;t do it so... I should be improving soon. It has been hard on<br/>\n  the kids and my marriage. But thankfully my marriage survived and is<br/>\n  now better than ever, but with the kids it is so hard to get back to<br/>\n  that place we were. One thing I have tried and am working on is just<br/>\n  DECIDING that I will be a joyful parent and finding more joy in daily<br/>\n  life. That has helped a bunch but man it is hard to get 5 ppl fed(my<br/>\n  husband fends for himself) with no $, and play and wash clothes(we<br/>\n  don&#39;t really clean so that is about it).<br/>\n  Anyway, I have really dug myself into a hole with my kids. I have not<br/>\n  treated them very well in the last year or two especially. I get angry<br/>\n  very easily and I am always incredibly tired. <br/>\n  I want to know what are some concrete steps I can do to start<br/>\n  connecting with them on the level we used to and maybe they need a<br/>\n  little demommying;). I am with them all the time but things right now<br/>\n  are really drawn on the line of kids on one side and adults the other.<br/>\n  There didn&#39;t used to be a line but now it is hard to cross. Also, we<br/>\n  get a lot of flack from the homeschoolers in our town because they<br/>\n  feel since my oldest isn&#39;t reading yet (9yrs) then unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  work. I don&#39;t believe this but also I feel that I have not been<br/>\n  playing, reading, strewing, exploring, enough with them. I have kind<br/>\n  of forgotten how.

So I am starting a holistic treatment plan<br/>\n&gt; I had made for my mom last year when she was diagnosed and she<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t do it so... I should be improving soon. It has been hard on<br/>\n&gt; the kids and my marriage. But thankfully my marriage survived and is<br/>\n&gt; now better than ever, but with the kids it is so hard to get back to<br/>\n&gt; that place we were. One thing I have tried and am working on is just<br/>\n&gt; DECIDING that I will be a joyful parent and finding more joy in daily<br/>\n&gt; life. That has helped a bunch but man it is hard to get 5 ppl fed(my<br/>\n&gt; husband fends for himself) with no $, and play and wash clothes(we<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t really clean so that is about it).<br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I have really dug myself into a hole with my kids. I have not<br/>\n&gt; treated them very well in the last year or two especially. I get angry<br/>\n&gt; very easily and I am always incredibly tired. <br/>\n&gt; I want to know what are some concrete steps I can do to start<br/>\n&gt; connecting with them on the level we used to and maybe they need a<br/>\n&gt; little demommying;).  I am with them all the time but things right now<br/>\n&gt; are really drawn on the line of kids on one side and adults the other.<br/>\n&gt; There didn&#39;t used to be a line but now it is hard to cross. Also, we<br/>\n&gt; get a lot of flack from the homeschoolers in our town because they<br/>\n&gt; feel since my oldest isn&#39;t reading yet (9yrs) then unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; work. I don&#39;t believe this but also I feel that I have not been<br/>\n&gt; playing, reading, strewing, exploring, enough with them. I have kind<br/>\n&gt; of forgotten how. I am just so tired all the time, I get really<br/>\n&gt; overwhelmed with things. I am starting a unschooling group in my area.<br/>\n&gt; There are only 3 or 4 of us that I know of but I am sure it will grow.<br/>\n&gt; I want the kids to have a core group that we can rely on not to judge<br/>\n&gt; us.  <br/>\n&gt; Any advice?<br/>\n&gt; Su <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78134331,"authorName":"Genant2@aol.com","from":"Genant2@...","profile":"genant04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]  Question (very long)","postDate":"1158503252","msgId":17288,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyOS5jNjYzYmMyLjMyM2ViNTU0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17277,"nextInTopic":17293,"prevInTime":17287,"nextInTime":17289,"topicId":17277,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 9/17/2006 6:40:13 A.M.

See what they are interested in right now and  ask a <br/>\nquestion or find something cool that relates to that.  They may see  your interest <br/>\nas wanting to reconnect.  Maybe talking to them.   Explain about your thyroid <br/>\nproblems and how that has made you feel, how it has  sort of controlled your <br/>\nmood, your behavior etc and that you want to change all  that.  That you want <br/>\nto reconnect with them, etc.  Also maybe finding  your own interest or passion <br/>\nand taking some time for that.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso I know an unschooling friend who is also working  with a thyroid <br/>\nproblem.  She does know what it is like to have no energy  etc.  So if you would like <br/>\nto talk with her just let me know and I will put  you in touch.

We have done attachment<br/>\nparenting since birth and that and my daughter&#39;s own desire led us to<br/>\nunschooling. I didn&#39;t want to spend 8 hours away from her and felt<br/>\nthat if she was going to be taught then I would be the best person to<br/>\ndo that. Now I feel that it is the opposite and she is my teacher and<br/>\nI the student and that works pretty well. She just learns what she<br/>\nwants to and the others follow suit. We have never done a curriculum<br/>\nand we don&#39;t want to. We have just let her and our subsiquent children<br/>\njust live in our lives an be completely present and welcome there. But<br/>\nover the last 4 years I had been sinking deeper and deeper into a<br/>\nterrible depression, winters are always harder. We moved to a<br/>\ndifferent house, in the city instead of in the country where I had<br/>\nstarted to feel really isolated, we lived there for 5 years: 4 months<br/>\nago we moved and that helped a lot. And recently I found out that I<br/>\nhave severe hypothyroidism.
