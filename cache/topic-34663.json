Where peace is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2101424674\">I just read something really neat last night.  What we practice starts in<br/>\nsmall things everyday and becomes the overall tone in the environment.<br/>\nWhere peace is practiced in small ways everyday all the time, it becomes the<br/>\noverall tone.  By the same token, war doesn&#39;t happen overnight but one small<br/>\nnasty after another builds and turns into conflicted areas cropping up<br/>\neverywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same things happen in all relationships, the human experience being<br/>\nremarkably predictable that way.  Conflict is automatic because we&#39;re all<br/>\ndifferent but that doesn&#39;t mean that finding ways to bridge the gap is out<br/>\nof range.  It can be practiced in all areas of different preferences for<br/>\nquiet or loud.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m an expert at isolating myself and I can be very protective of my time<br/>\nand attention.  It backfires if I do it a lot.  So I make sure everyone is<br/>\n&quot;filled&quot; before I take off for yonder parts, and I check back frequently.  I<br/>\ncheck back *more* often if anyone seems to need more than usual for some<br/>\nreason (and sometimes I may not have a clue what that reason is).  Sometimes<br/>\nI go somewhere but I&#39;m more likely to find ways to tune out.  If I leave the<br/>\npremises or go off somewhere mentally far far away and someone *really*<br/>\nneeds my attention or just my presence (which is a kind of attention), it<br/>\njust makes that person behave in more desperate ways toward me and starts to<br/>\nbecome the tone of our relationship.  After a while, it settles in their<br/>\nbones and becomes part of who they are to expect that I&#39;m absent a lot.  I<br/>\ntry to attend, pay attention, to the need for *more* first.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can relate to what you&#39;re going through.  Karl and his dad both love<br/>\nnoise, and I really don&#39;t much.  Sometimes, he is willing to wear<br/>\nheadphones... other times, *I* put them on myself because some noise<br/>\nproblems are not solved by him donning headphones, especially if he is<br/>\nsinging or cheering on his character.  So I find white noise or soothing or<br/>\nnonobtrusive something or other that I can listen to.  I can still hear<br/>\nothers and remain available over long periods of time but I&#39;m not *right*<br/>\nthere drowning in the middle of a lot of noise.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 7/19/08, hlg567 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:halfshadow1@...\">halfshadow1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   What do you do and how often do you need personal time alone?

Here&#39;s a link:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html\">http://www.personalitypathways.com/type_inventory.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge and I are both fairly introverted, and Ray&#39;s a pretty intense <br/>\nextravert, so first of all it was helpful for me and George to <br/>\nunderstand that Ray really *needed* a lot of human interaction. That <br/>\nlet us feel better about all those days when we&#39;d play and hang out <br/>\nand talk with Ray all day long and he Still wanted More! We weren&#39;t <br/>\nautomatic failures. Phew. It also let us understand that we weren&#39;t <br/>\nautomatically bad for wanting some &quot;down time&quot;. Between those, we <br/>\nwere able to start looking for solutions that met his needs *and* <br/>\nour needs. And since Ray was (still is) soooooo extraverted and <br/>\nreally really verbal besides (not always the same thing) it made <br/>\nsense to talk with Ray about the matter, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt age six or seven (I think it was six) Ray wasn&#39;t sure he believed <br/>\nus about some people needing less &quot;people time&quot; for awhile. We <br/>\npretty much just kept repeating it any time the information seemed <br/>\nto apply: &quot;I&#39;m getting tired and need some quiet time, I know you <br/>\nstill need people time, wanna see if anyone&#39;s at the creek? Then you <br/>\ncan play while I sit in the shade.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the brainstorming kind of started informally on George and my <br/>\nside with Ray making suggestions once he started to catch on that we <br/>\nreally did have this weird need. There was one day in particular <br/>\nthat we all actually sat around and *talked* about it, tossed ideas <br/>\nback and forth in a real brainstorming session. It just kind of <br/>\nhappened, though, which probably doesn&#39;t help *you* any ;) One day <br/>\nGeorge and I were well rested and we were all eating and Ray, of <br/>\ncourse, was talking and next thing you know we&#39;re brainstorming ways <br/>\nto get all our needs met without hurting each other&#39;s feelings. <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the solutions were things Ray came up with - he thought of <br/>\nseveral activities that he regularly did that he didn&#39;t really <br/>\n*need* to touch base with another human being every six seconds and <br/>\nwe all made an effort to work those things into a regular routine so <br/>\nGeorge and I could have some down time on a predictable basis. But I <br/>\nthink that worked *because* it was Ray&#39;s idea - it was a favor he <br/>\nwas doing for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also think it helped to really focus, not just on his needs, but <br/>\non communicating with him about the process we were using to meet <br/>\nthose needs as well as our own. I just mentioned this in another <br/>\npost in a different context. The way Ray learns about the world is <br/>\ntied up in the fact that he&#39;s really really social. So verbalizing <br/>\nour process was really important to Ray - it let him be a part of <br/>\nthat process in a way that was really meaningful to him. It let him <br/>\nfeel connected to us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of that is helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 6, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224031522,"authorName":"Zoa Conner","from":"Zoa Conner &lt;zoaconner@...&gt;","profile":"zoaconner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Breaks from the noise","postDate":"1216586317","msgId":34676,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM0QTkxQThELkU0Rjklem9hY29ubmVyQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc2MDU4cCs0bmt2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34675,"nextInTopic":34679,"prevInTime":34675,"nextInTime":34677,"topicId":34663,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Meredith, I¹d love to hear more about this particular brainstorm ...

Does it<br/>\ndepend on whether you have a high energy kiddo? I can&#39;t read if my son<br/>\nis talking...even just little bits here and there. It interrupts me.<br/>\nAm i too sensitive or is this natural to always hear every sound from<br/>\nyour kid? Same goes for thinking.<br/>\nSometimes i shush him and say hey, I want to read this for a few minutes.<br/>\n Ya think that&#39;s okay?<br/>\nSometimes i have to get away, to town or the library by myself to<br/>\nthink about ideas for art or to browse. I would love to find more<br/>\nbalance at home so i don&#39;t have to leave but wonder will it be fair to<br/>\nmy son to ask? He is going to be 7 in October. How do i talk to him<br/>\nabout wanting some quiet time? <br/>\nOne issue with me is the nintendo ds which he loves to play,all<br/>\nday,very loud. He is good at it and happy,that&#39;s good.However, I feel<br/>\nlike i am living in an arcade with the bells,whistles and music from<br/>\nit,lol. We have two different sets of head phones but he refuses to<br/>\nwear them. If i am doing something he will come over to me every<br/>\nminute or so and say:wow,look at this or hey, i got through the level!<br/>\nI remind him that i&#39;m in the middle of doing something and he will say<br/>\nokay,sorry but come right back.I do play with him most of the day it&#39;s<br/>\nwhen i am doing something he doesn&#39;t care and being asked to look at<br/>\nhis game all the time gets old.What&#39;s a solution for this?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34682,"nextTopicId":34542}}
