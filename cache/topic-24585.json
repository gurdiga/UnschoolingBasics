The new episode is now up on the newly redesigned site! I&#39;ve<br/>\nalso added a blog to add links to articles, sites and programs I find<br/>\nwhile surfing around, and a place for folks to sign up for email updates.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to try out more with the animation idea - something a<br/>\nlittle simpler than my original idea to start with. Has anyone seen<br/>\nthe new show &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;? Basically, they record real people<br/>\ntalking about a topic. No scripts, just different groups sharing their<br/>\nreal opinions. Then they take the voices and add animated clay animals<br/>\nspeaking the words. I&#39;d like to try something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids (of any age) are interested, have them send me a sound<br/>\nfile where they talk about their favorite game -- be it a board game,<br/>\nsport, card game, video game, whatever! They can talk about WHY it&#39;s<br/>\ntheir favorite game, or they can describe what it&#39;s about or explain<br/>\nto others briefly how to play it. Hopefully this will provide some<br/>\ngood results and be a fun experience for the kids who are part of it,<br/>\nas well as entertaining to those watching.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who has visited! Hope to hear from you soon!<br/>\n-Jason Holm<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.inflatablestudios.com\">http://www.inflatablestudios.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24581,"nextTopicId":24479}}
