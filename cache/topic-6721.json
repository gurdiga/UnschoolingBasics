Dh<br/>\nand I have been pleased with this - at times one has to wait. <br/>\nHowever, lately if they don&#39;t have enough we&#39;ll cover the difference.<br/>\n Our issue with this is that one isn&#39;t always able to get what they<br/>\nwant, when they want it.

I knew nothing about budgeting,<br/>\nsaving, spending...  I see such value in the kids having their money<br/>\nto spend how they want.

That has<br/>\nstirred my thinking and would very much appreciate you elaborating, if<br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t mind.
