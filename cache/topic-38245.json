Conference in Wakefield, MA (just  <br/>\noutside of Boston)<br/>\nAugust 27-30, 2009<br/>\n <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"

2009. <br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s right, you heard it here first, the early bird deadline is extended  <br/>\nuntil May 1, 2009, so jump on board now and save some money.  <br/>\n_<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html_\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html_</a> <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html)\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/regform.html)</a>    In addition all early bird registrations will be <br/>\nentered into a drawing for a  beautiful gift basket stuffed with lots of fun <br/>\nthings and gift  certificates.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAlong with an unschooling conference jam packed with Sessions by your  <br/>\nfavorite unschooling speakers (to include  Rue Kream, Madeline Rains,  Kelly, Ben, <br/>\nand Cameron Lovejoy, Erika Davis-Pitre, Dayna Martin, and Eli  Gerzon), and <br/>\nfunshops for children of all ages, we have planned a  Dance with Karaoke on <br/>\nThursday night, a talent show on Saturday where you will enjoy a variety of acts <br/>\nranging from a joke-telling  3 year old to experienced professional performers, <br/>\nand an Untrepreneurial  Fair at which unschoolers (adults and kids) who are <br/>\nregistered for the  conference may sell items they make to conference attendees. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nWe are lucky to have an abundance of space at this  conference site, so in <br/>\naddition to spaces for presentations, discussions, and  funshops, we&#39;ll also <br/>\nhave a Playroom with things especially meant for our  younger ones to enjoy, a <br/>\nGame Room where people will be able to set up their  computer and video games, <br/>\nas well as tables for card, role-playing, and other  kinds of games, and a <br/>\nCreativity Room, stuffed with the tools for arts and  crafts and inventing.<br/>\n <br/>\nTo top off a weekend of discussion and fun we will  have a Monday picnic <br/>\nplanned, so stay Sunday and get to know other fellow  unschoolers better, chat, <br/>\nconnect, create lasting friendships and join us to  close out the conference at <br/>\nthe Picnic on Monday.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll conference attendees will receive a conference  handbook with directory <br/>\nincluded. <br/>\n <br/>\nRemember to stay up to date on all conference
