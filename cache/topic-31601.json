Well, THAT and...ummmm...forcing at ALL! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little bit of reading on dyslexia that I have done suggests that the<br/>\nsooner a child with dyslexia gets help, the better.

I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it has so much to do with the &quot;nature of learning&quot; <br/>\n(although it *does*) as it it does with the excessive *need* in school <br/>\nto keep to a time table.<br/>\n<br/>\n*We*, as unschooling parents have all the time in the world to read to <br/>\nand for our children. School teachers with 30 kids at a time canNOT <br/>\ngive such individualized attention to each and every child. Plus, if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t get those kids to read *soon*, the teachers&#39; own &quot;report <br/>\ncards&quot; may be bad, and they could lose their jobs. Ummm.....no such <br/>\nluck. Seems you can&#39;t FIRE a teacher! &lt;g&gt; And even if you *could*, the <br/>\nshortage would mean that teacher would be hired by the another school <br/>\none district over! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously &lt;g&gt;, there is NO hurry with unschooling. So there&#39;s no <br/>\ntime table to worry about. So it becomes a non-issue. Even a *true* <br/>\ndyslexic will figure out reading with a little more time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I don&#39;t know of one, single grown unschooler who cannot read---and <br/>\nread very, very well. But I know of many schooled adults who cannot <br/>\nread.

Not true  <br/>\nfor unschooled kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe risk associated with the treatment seems huge and completely  <br/>\nignored by educator/specialists. I&#39;ve seen it over and over. A 7 year  <br/>\nold schooled child is diagnosed as dyslexic and gets treatment for it.  <br/>\nBy 9, yes, they are reading better. But they NEVER &quot;get over&quot; the  <br/>\nfeeling that something is wrong with them and they never come to think  <br/>\nof themselves as competent readers. They continue to struggle for the  <br/>\nrest of their lives.  Unschooled kid at 7 is not reading - parents  <br/>\nread to him, get him books from audible.com, listen to cds, surround  <br/>\nhim with plenty of print and screen text, play with words and writing  <br/>\nwhen it is fun for him.

I just feel completely compelled to <br/>\njump right in and reply to your post though.  It reminds me very much <br/>\nof how I felt with my son. <br/>\nFour years ago my oldest child was 7 years old.  He was as bright as <br/>\na whip....but for the world he could not read.  Wellll...you know, he <br/>\ncould read very basic books (notice the contradiction =))...but he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t read like most would expect him to.   He reversed letters, <br/>\nnumbers and words.  He said letters moved around on the page.  He <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t follow a line of print.  He squinted when he looked at <br/>\nprint.  He avoided looking at print, and I realized he had for most <br/>\nof his life.  He hated going to the library.  His younger brother (5 <br/>\nat that time) could read better than him, and had pretty much learned <br/>\nto read independently.  I felt a sense of panic seep into my life as <br/>\nI researched reading remediation, dyslexia, and the numerous programs <br/>\nthat existed, sure to *work* for my child. I had just started <br/>\nhomeschooling and felt full of uncertainty. Reports saying *if your <br/>\nchild didn&#39;t learn to read by such and such age they would be at an <br/>\neducational disadvantage their entire life* filled me with anxiety. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did have him evaluated by an educational something or another, and <br/>\na vision therapist.  I tried a few reading programs for him, but they <br/>\nonly resulted in frustration and anger.  He said he didn&#39;t want to <br/>\never learn how to read.  Boy..I tell you, that was what scared me the <br/>\nmost I think.   After several months of this, I finally just .... let <br/>\ngo.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI stopped trying to teach him to read.  It was hard to do.  I <br/>\nworried.  I worried and worried that I was doing the wrong thing.  <br/>\nPeople questioned me too.  I continued to surround him with options <br/>\nand opportunities, especially lots and lots of audio books, but I <br/>\nleft him alone.   I do not know exactly how it happened, because it <br/>\nhappened to him privately, but he now is an excellent reader who <br/>\neagerly asks when is our next library trip.  He actually takes <br/>\nwhatever book he is currently reading with us to the library so he <br/>\ncan continue to read that particular book while his brother and I are <br/>\nstill browsing.  His bed is covered with books.  He reads slowly (so <br/>\ndoes my husband).  He still reverses letters quite regularly when he <br/>\nwrites.  But, for the life of me, I am convinced that if I continued <br/>\nto push programs on him he would be a very frustrated young person to <br/>\nthis day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike other people have mentioned...7 is so young.  Of course, when my <br/>\nson was 7, I didn&#39;t think that.  I thought, &quot;Why isn&#39;t my son reading <br/>\nlike expected?&quot;  <br/>\nLook into the child&#39;s heart and do what seems right for them, the <br/>\nindividual.  Forget about expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember Ron Davis&#39; book, The Gift of Dyslexia, was very helpful to <br/>\nme and to my son.  Honestly, I read parts of that book and thought <br/>\nthey were completely off the wall.  But, when I read them out loud to <br/>\nmy son, he related to them.  He definitely has a way of looking at <br/>\nthings that is different from my way....but that doesn&#39;t mean that he <br/>\nis broken or that he needs to be fixed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy heart goes out to you.  I think I can relate to the worries and <br/>\nfrustrations.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and <br/>\nencourage you to relax as much as possible.

Get help for your son while consulting him on the <br/>\noptions available along the way.  If he doesn&#39;t want to do any of it, <br/>\nthen that IS the right decision for him, for now.  It doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat he won&#39;t do something in the future.  And, he may find his own <br/>\nunique way of easing his eye strain or letter jumble (That&#39;s what <br/>\nDavis did, with no help from anyone).<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dana</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212831361,"authorName":"sarah hubbard","from":"&quot;sarah hubbard&quot; &lt;quiltingearth@...&gt;","profile":"quiltingearthmama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: dyslexia","postDate":"1207485764","msgId":31613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODMwMWM4OTdlMyRiNWVmMmMyMCQ2NzAxYThjMEBodWJiPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZ0OWU5cSthOTJyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31604,"nextInTopic":31619,"prevInTime":31612,"nextInTime":31614,"topicId":31601,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think maybe I came across as sounding like I want him to be reading and reading well right now - that is not what I am saying.

I am actually very comfortable with the idea that his brain may not be ready and we are trying very hard to not hit him with this label yet until we know for sure.  That being said, he CAN read and he actually reads somewhat well, but he told us that the letters get all jumbled and that they look backwards to him (this was completely unprovoked) and that his eyes hurt - all signs of dyslexia - and this is what is frustrating him.  Dyslexia is a condition of the brain it isn&#39;t something one can outgrow it is something they have to work very hard at controlling and I&#39;m not stressed about it, I just was looking for suggestions from folks who may have dealt with it through homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the various inputs.<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: dana_burdick <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, April 05, 2008 10:59 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: dyslexia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I started writing comments of various types, but the same thing kept <br/>\n  coming up in my mind.

We have a child (he&#39;s 7) we are pretty sure has it and we trying very hard to not allow him to be pinned with that as a label.  He wants desperately to read well and is trying (not with me pushing him), but he gets so deeply frustrated with it and cries.  I am finding myself worrying that if we don&#39;t find some resolve soon, he is going to be too frustrated and give up.  I know in time he will want to read, but my husband has struggled with it most of his life and has just in the last 10 years become a strong reader.  I want to offer our child help early on so that he can enjoy the world of books fully.  I know there are plenty of other ways out there for him to learn things and I can fully embrace that as I already do, but he WANTS to read and read well, so I&#39;m looking for ideas on strategies to help him in an unschooling manner...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31598,"nextTopicId":31607}}
