Because he was<br/>\nsuppressed at school he got angry and had concentration issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis teacher had very black energy and he brought her to the light.after that<br/>\nshe was a lot nicer and he felt like he finished school. So we quit(this is<br/>\nthe short version;)). My kids are now 1,5 month at home and I have to say.<br/>\nBacouse he couldn&#39;t get angry at school anymore he got angry at me. As you<br/>\nmight know the only thing you can really change in this world is your self.<br/>\nSo I changed my behaviour to him. I let him do what ever he wanted and let<br/>\nhim stay up as late as he wanted. This acted out in tv,x-box,psp,gameboy and<br/>\npc all day and night. ( Idecided not to worry) and I also told him that when<br/>\nI asked him something he could refuse . wich he does very aggressefly(?) :-)<br/>\nI also told him I&#39;d try not to yell at him and asked him not to be grumpy at<br/>\nmy. And to be hounest since I let go of him acting &#39;normal&#39; hes acting more<br/>\n&#39;normal&#39;. And today I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll let go of the foodthing too.

And that is actually what I wanted to tell you listen to your<br/>\nheart and figure out what works for you and your family. Don&#39;t let the<br/>\npolice, the neighbours, your family or a therapist tell you what to do. Give<br/>\nyour son the time to adjust to home and let him be himself. Don&#39;t push him<br/>\njust let him be. I found out my son had a lot of old anger just by talking<br/>\nabout it. Don&#39;t see him as a child that didn&#39;t work at all. When I started<br/>\ntalking to him and respecting him like person/human being he starte to<br/>\nrelax. And I&#39;m not saying that everything is perfect now.

You being <br/>\nhit by a 13 year old is enough to call the police but when you hit him (slap, <br/>\nif you prefer) he can&#39;t even hit back?  Why didn&#39;t he call the police after <br/>\nyou hit him?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe police were called- cps investigated and found no abuse in the household. <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI am reading about abuse.  You are writing about abuse.  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMy first thought is that I&#39;d forget about *handling* CPS and focus on this <br/>\nchild of yours before its too late.  Go hug him now and tell him that you love <br/>\nhim and *love him*.  Then you can work on trying to build a relationship and <br/>\nworking together towards a life of joy.  Look at things through his eyes and ask <br/>\nyourself how you&#39;d be responding to being treated like he&#39;s been treated -- <br/>\nat school?  At home? Think of something outrageously sweet and thoughtful you&#39;d <br/>\ndo for a friend that had been through similar troubles and then do it for <br/>\nyour son.  Do it today. Treat today like it is your last day together.  Enjoy <br/>\neach other and see all the good in each other.  Can you take a vacation together?<br/>\n <br/>\nSomething brought you to this list (just in time!) and I&#39;d treat it as the <br/>\nblessing it is and start reading the archives and following the links.  This <br/>\nlist inspires change through personal growth and awareness rather than teaching <br/>\nhow to change others or how to breed conformists that don&#39;t cuss.  I&#39;d rather <br/>\nhear cussing than hear about another frustrated thirteen year old shooting his <br/>\nclassmates and teachers.  Cussing is better than slapping, too.<br/>\n <br/>\nLastly, ignore recommendations from therapists that make no sense.  It sounds <br/>\nlike your son has a lot of healing to do since his negative parting with the <br/>\nschool so if anyone recommends throwing him back into that fire, I&#39;d seek a <br/>\nsecond opinion. Anyone that suggests there&#39;s such a thing as too much Mommy <br/>\nshould be studying gorillas rather than advising parents and families.  Who does <br/>\nyour son have for support? If a child cannot feel (and be) supported by his <br/>\nmother, from whom should he seek it?  Teachers?  Fellow students? Drugs?  The <br/>\ntherapist?  Therapy can be like a buffet, take what works and leave the rest.  No <br/>\ntherapist can love your son or be a better parent to him than you.  Be that <br/>\nparent starting right now. Be his friend. Treat him like you want to be <br/>\ntreated.  Let go of your own anger and model the behavior you want to see.  Our <br/>\nchildren ultimately become us.  Teach him, show him kindness and joy and you&#39;ll see <br/>\nmore of it from him. Our world needs more kindness and less hitting.

That is all I would <br/>\noffer them. Schooling is certainly more the schools responsibility than <br/>\nCPS&#39;s so if the school is happy with the documentation, it should <br/>\nsatisfy CPS too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This year David is going to take the <br/>\n&gt; standardized test with the school- becuase we are looking at getting <br/>\n&gt; him back in school- the therapost has reccommened it- he says one of <br/>\n&gt; david&#39;s problems is &quot;too much mommy&quot;.

Of course I don&#39;t know your situation, and maybe you agree <br/>\nwith what yours is saying, BUT, are you sure they are not just giving <br/>\nyou a mainstream thinking answer? How many homeschoolers have heard <br/>\nthese same arguments - &quot;too much mommy&quot;, low &quot;socilaization skills&quot;, <br/>\nfrom others? Also, you indicated that your son had some <br/>\nemotional/behavorial issues, that were there when he was in school. I <br/>\nwould seriously think about that. Is it his emotional/behavorial issues <br/>\nthat may be causing this supposed lack of socilaization skills?

It involves  <br/>\nfinding mutually agreed upon solutions, where the needs of both  <br/>\nparties are not only considered but addressed. Everyone�s wants and  <br/>\nneeds are equally valid, regardless of age. Conflicting wants or  <br/>\nneeds are discussed and mutually agreeable solutions are created or  <br/>\nnegotiated which meet the underlying needs of all parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeginners to this concept are welcome to join this list, living  <br/>\nconsensually is an ongoing process of discovery. We ask that you be  <br/>\nopen to or on the path toward living consensually. We hope to explore  <br/>\nthe issues by asking questions, and sharing our experiences.  <br/>\nParenting is a sensitive issue for many people but we are all here to  <br/>\npractice this process, and can do so if the environment remains one  <br/>\nof respect, compassion, exploration and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nENJOY PARENTING<br/>\n<br/>\n- You might like enjoyparenting.com<br/>\n<br/>\n- My hands-down all time fave is Scott Noelle&#39;s site.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.enjoyparenting.com/\">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/</a><br/>\nHis Daily Groove emails are the *best*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMOTHERING.COM<br/>\n<br/>\n[This one looks more wide-ranging in parenting styles though  <br/>\ndefinitely away from punishment.

I have connections  <br/>\nwith the people who run the agency and once they even gave my son a  <br/>\npeaceful parenting t-shirt.
