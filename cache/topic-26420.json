We can get that now but we&#39;d need to skip <br/>\nBurger King a few times until next pay day. Or we can get something <br/>\nthat costs less and still do some Burger King&quot; (that is, when Burger <br/>\nKing was a two or three times a week lunch as DH and DS headed to <br/>\nDH&#39;s part time job after going to park days and such). Sometimes, <br/>\nthe toy was the priority and they brown bagged lunches. Sometimes, <br/>\nthe prospect of PBJ and juice boxes wasn&#39;t so much fun so the toy <br/>\nwas noted and postponed a little. It&#39;s not so much big numbers as it <br/>\nis a concept of money comes in and has to pay for this and this and <br/>\nthis and that. When I&#39;d pay bills, DS would often sit and be the <br/>\nstamper (thank heaven for whomever invented the self-adhesive <br/>\npostage stamp!) and put the return address labels on. We&#39;d look at <br/>\nthe little bar graph of electricity usage and see where we used lots <br/>\nand where we used less. I&#39;d talk about how I was paying the bank for <br/>\nthe house or the oil company for the oil to heat the house or <br/>\nwhatever. Not lots of numbers and details but the general idea that <br/>\nI get paid for my work and then the money gets used for all these <br/>\nthings we like to have - house, food, vehicles with fuel to go <br/>\nplaces, and so on. Over time, it&#39;s gotten more detailed as he&#39;s <br/>\ngotten older and wanted to know &quot;how much does oil cost?&quot; (now <br/>\nthere&#39;s a loaded question for you lol). It helps too that he&#39;s got <br/>\nhis own spending money free and clear - we pay that when I get paid <br/>\njust like any other &#39;bill&#39;.

(i suggested to her<br/>\nthat what she might really be interested in with that doll is the<br/>\nclothes she has, and that perhaps we could make some clothes for her<br/>\ndoll so she could dress her up, but she disagreed and said, no, it was<br/>\nthe other doll she wanted.)<br/>\n<br/>\nshe also wants nearly every toy she touches at other folks&#39; houses.<br/>\ni&#39;d like to let go of making the toy-buying decisions for her but am<br/>\nnot clear on how to avoid either a) giving her a budget (which would<br/>\nby necessity have to be &quot;manufactured&quot;---i don&#39;t give myself a<br/>\nclothing budget, for example, i just self-regulate---if i purchase a<br/>\nlot one month, i don&#39;t for the next little while) or b) buying<br/>\neverything we see (which would not only blow a lot of $ we could use<br/>\nfor other things, but also make a huge amount of clutter; we&#39;ve<br/>\nalready found it necessary to put some less-used toys in the basement<br/>\nto make space for playing with the ones that are out). is it time for<br/>\nallowance? do other unschoolers do allowance?<br/>\n<br/>\nwe&#39;ve talked about why she wants one toy or the other, and what<br/>\nsimilar things she has at home, and how she would play with the new<br/>\ntoy, and at what point she would not feel that she needed another of<br/>\nwhatever item X, say, and we&#39;ve talked about how her dad works to make<br/>\nmoney for us to use for our house and our food and our clothes and our<br/>\ntoys (etc), and that if we spend money on one thing, there will be<br/>\nless to use for other things, but it seems like it&#39;s too early to<br/>\nintroduce her to our household budget via microsoft money---she&#39;s<br/>\nstill fuzzy on quantities greater than 4. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\npardon my incoherence; it&#39;s been a tough day. thanks in advance for<br/>\nall your thoughtful answers, and for helping us wander our way towards<br/>\nfull unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26178,"nextTopicId":26456}}
