I replied in some of your other posts about this same situation and<br/>\nat the risk of sounding like a broken record:<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re probably feeling insecure about their future.  I don&#39;t know though<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m not there.  If this is the case, have you reassured them or do<br/>\nyou even have any grounds to be able to reassure them of being able to stay<br/>\nwith you where they feel safe?  Do you even want them to stay and, if you<br/>\ndo, have you said so?  It seems obvious to me that you care very deeply.<br/>\nI&#39;m reading your posts though and I can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re welcome to stay<br/>\nwith you or not.  Are the children getting similar messages ... you care and<br/>\nmaybe you do (or don&#39;t) want them there with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion (me being a complete novice to your situation) is to first<br/>\nclear up this information for yourself (if you haven&#39;t already) and then<br/>\ncommunicate more openly without laying too much responsibility or<br/>\nexpectation on the kids to understand you or do what you want.  Another<br/>\nthing is when communicating more openly, listen to what they say (or seem to<br/>\nbe saying) and inquire even more so as to get a really clear picture and<br/>\nunderstand even more about where they&#39;re coming from.  Their communication<br/>\nmay still end up being largely nonverbal.  That&#39;s what the kids are doing<br/>\nwhen they lash out... communicating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen even if they *do* end up going to live with their biological mom,<br/>\nthey&#39;ll have an even better basis to trust an adult who cares enough to<br/>\nreally listen even more than she already is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis situation sounds really difficult, but maybe check out Naomi Aldort&#39;s<br/>\nRaising Our Children Raising Ourselves.  It may lend you some extra sanity<br/>\nor give you some more good thoughts in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":348924346,"authorName":"Robin","from":"Robin &lt;GaiaAlive@...&gt;","profile":"robinnidana","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"responding to upsetting events","postDate":"1217981882","msgId":35397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4OThFREJBLjUwNzA0MDlAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":35399,"prevInTime":35396,"nextInTime":35398,"topicId":35397,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My kids are experiencing upset in their lives right now and are acting out often with hostility toward each other (well, and me, too).
