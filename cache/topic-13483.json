Sometimes","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-215447314\">MY husband works full time and doesn&#39;t have as much time with the <br/>\nkids as I do. One of the things he does is go out with them without <br/>\nthe other two. Sometimes it&#39;s just to do some errands, other times <br/>\nit&#39;s someplace like miniature golf or the water park. He and my <br/>\ndaughter have a date planned to see X3 when it comes out. <br/>\nHe also tries to find common interests. Like with my son, they both <br/>\nlove auto racing and we have a local track so they go there <br/>\nsometimes just to hang out and spend time together.<br/>\nHe also takes them to any evening and weekend activites that they <br/>\nhave so he has time to talk to them on the ride there and back. <br/>\nThe other thing that has helped them connect is our trampoline! Oh <br/>\nmy god....he is such a big kid on that thing!! LOL!! He gets on with <br/>\nmy little one and just bounces her around like a jumping bean! <br/>\nActually, that&#39;s how her last baby tooth came out.
