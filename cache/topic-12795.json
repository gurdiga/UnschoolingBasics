A true unschooler at heart, but<br/>\njust had such a hard time applying it to his children. When I was<br/>\nsearching for a guitar instructor for Trevor, Markus says &quot;make sure<br/>\nyou find a teacher that will let him learn whatever he wants and not<br/>\nsuck the joy out of playing.&quot;<br/>\nNO...REALLY honey?;) I&#39;d just look at him like &quot;WHY are you having<br/>\nsuch a  hard time with all of this????&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe finally had his epiphany, but he still thinks some chores are ok.<br/>\nMost of the time he just handles whatever is bugging  him, rather than<br/>\nbugging the kids though.
