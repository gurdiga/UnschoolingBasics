And it doesn&#39;t take movie stars to hang around<br/>\nand help with the kids.<br/>\nHilary Clinton used that saying incorrectly. The African saying, does<br/>\nnot translate well because the village WAS your family. A tribe was<br/>\ntypically aunts, uncles, cousins etc... and you married into another<br/>\ntribe.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, it&#39;s great to have extended family for helping raise<br/>\nchildren...most of us have to create our own communities of support<br/>\nthough. Family can fail us, society at large isn&#39;t the answer for most<br/>\nof us and it certainly isn&#39;t the government we want to turn to!! <br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9575,"nextTopicId":9571}}
