Having only been<br/>\nan L&L attendee, I can&#39;t give you first hand on RE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know the lady that runs it is a total unschooler (there was a great<br/>\narticle about her grown son recently) but I think they allow for a bit<br/>\nmore &quot;stretch&quot; in the topics presented. Some of the talks lean more<br/>\ntowards relaxed/eclectic I believe.<br/>\nAlso, L&L is geared to be very family inclusive. The funshops have all<br/>\nages attending and is very kid friendly. It gets a little hectic<br/>\nsometimes too...very bubbly and loud and overwhelming at times, but<br/>\nthe kids are so involved in everything. I love it.<br/>\n<br/>\nL&L is the only conference I know of, where ALL of the talks are about<br/>\nunschooling and there is huge support for radical unschooling. It&#39;s<br/>\namazing to be surrounded by hundreds of people all treating kids<br/>\nrespectfully and as equals. My ATC funshop had ALL ages and the adults<br/>\nwere completely supportive of every single persons work. I&#39;ve never<br/>\nbeen in a community that supports kids with so much respect before.<br/>\nIt&#39;s pretty awesome.

L&L seem to have more, umm.., real folks. By<br/>\nthat I mean people who are unschooling and sharing<br/>\nexperiences with each other, like on this list. <br/>\nIs that the main difference?
