I<br/>\ndon&#39;t discuss things with him generally unless he shows an interest or<br/>\ndesire on his own first. Like this afternoon he wanted to know when<br/>\nwe&#39;re getting our chickens. I showed him my garden/farm binder that<br/>\nI&#39;ve been working on --full of drawings, lists, and seed orders. I use<br/>\na 3 ring binder with clear plastic sleeves. One is for the McMurray<br/>\nHatchery, with our chick order and list of things to do to get ready<br/>\nfor our chicks next month, and then a list of things that need to done<br/>\nby the time they go outside. He looked through the catalog at the<br/>\ndrawings of the chicks we&#39;re getting. He asked if he could get an<br/>\nexotic chick, so I said we&#39;d need to do some research to make sure the<br/>\nothers would get along with it, or choose a breed that would live<br/>\nharmoniously with the layers. I mentioned that the 4-H small animals<br/>\ngroup will be starting their projects this month, so he asked if he<br/>\ncould go and start the chicken project.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m finally in a place (location ,and in life) where I am ready to<br/>\nfocus on manifesting the life that feels most true to  me, which is<br/>\nstarting a market garden business. He&#39;s somewhat interested in<br/>\nlearning with me, but I don&#39;t intend to force him to participate. He&#39;s<br/>\nwanting to earn money so he can buy a laptop. He has a computer that<br/>\nwe bought, but we can&#39;t afford a laptop at this time. We can afford to<br/>\nhire him to help with some of the work in the gardens and going to<br/>\nmarket, which he thinks he&#39;s interested in, so he can save up.<br/>\nThinking and doing, being two different animals, of course. We&#39;ll see<br/>\nhow it feels to him once we begin. Right now it&#39;s planning, and he&#39;s<br/>\nvery interested in helping with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s restless, good..that means he&#39;s probably healed a lot.
