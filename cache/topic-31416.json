I do have a<br/>\nquestioned for you more seasoned parents.<br/>\nDakari (8 yrs) is still prone to meltdowns. I&#39;m still not sure what to do,<br/>\nif anything at all. And then I think after 8 yrs I ought to know what to do<br/>\nto help him. But maybe I don&#39;t want to &quot;help&quot; him..maybe I want to stop him<br/>\nfrom melting down (epiphany moment).<br/>\nYesterday we went to the circus - great fun! When the ringmaster announced<br/>\nthat the circus was done, and &quot;thanks for coming&quot;, Dakari immediately put on<br/>\nhis coat and got up. The ring master said it was time to go, so to Dakari<br/>\nthat meant it was time to go. But it was sooo crowded. And Khalid and<br/>\nKhidar were sleeping, and we had to put on their coats, so Jabari and I<br/>\nwanted to wait for the Verizon Center (here in D.C.) to clear out. That was<br/>\nnot Dakari&#39;s plan. He just broke down sobbing, and had trouble breathing as<br/>\nthough he was having a panic attack. I asked Dakari to come and see me -<br/>\nJabari was frustrated by it all - and I gave him a hug and said &quot;it&#39;s time<br/>\nto leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot; I said &quot;the ringmaster said it was time to go, so<br/>\nyou wanted to leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot;. I hugged him again. He was crying<br/>\npretty hard. Then he slowly stopped and started rubbing my back like I was<br/>\nthe one upset! LOL What a sweet boy.<br/>\nI guess I did the right thing. I just always wonder what the trigger is.<br/>\nWell, actually..the trigger is that something didn&#39;t happen exactly as he<br/>\nthinks it should. Unfortunately I&#39;m not able to arrange life for Dakari so<br/>\nthat upsets don&#39;t happen. The best I can do is help him to find a way to<br/>\ncalm down. Jabari can&#39;t take it at all. Sadly we&#39;ve both been known to<br/>\nshame Dakari for his reactions. Ugh! <br/>\nThe other thing is Dakari continues to follow everything that Safiya (9)<br/>\ndoes. Her bookbag handle broke so she changed bookbags. Dakari then wanted<br/>\nto change his bookbag. But the other one he had wasn&#39;t working. So he<br/>\nstarted to cry. It&#39;s like that with everything. If Safiya says her leg<br/>\nhurt because she fell, Dakari will say his arm hurts. If Safiya says she&#39;s<br/>\nhungry, Dakari will be hungry too. If Safiya says &quot;I&#39;m taking a shower&quot;<br/>\nDakari will say &quot;I&#39;m taking a bath&quot;. It&#39;s as though he doesn&#39;t have his own<br/>\ninternal navigational system. Is that okay? It&#39;s still really annoying to<br/>\nSafiya. She doesn&#39;t like it when she goes to do something or make something<br/>\nor draw something and Dakari does the exact same thing. If I want to know<br/>\nwhat Dakari really likes I have to ask him first. And then ask Safiya. And<br/>\nthen Dakari will change his mind afterwards to whatever it was Safiya said!<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s because she older? I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay..sorry for the long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe at peace,<br/>\nMaisha<br/>\nKhalfani Family Adventures &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/\">http://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\nEarthSpirit Journeys &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://earthspiritjourneys.blogspot.com/\">http://earthspiritjourneys.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>\naccept and love ourselves.

I do have a<br/>\nquestioned for you more seasoned parents.<br/>\nDakari (8 yrs) is still prone to meltdowns.  I&#39;m still not sure what to do,<br/>\nif anything at all.  And then I think after 8 yrs I ought to know what to do<br/>\nto help him.  But maybe I don&#39;t want to &quot;help&quot; him..maybe I want to stop him<br/>\nfrom melting down (epiphany moment).<br/>\nYesterday we went to the circus - great fun!  When the ringmaster announced<br/>\nthat the circus was done, and &quot;thanks for coming&quot;, Dakari immediately put on<br/>\nhis coat and got up.  The ring master said it was time to go, so to Dakari<br/>\nthat meant it was time to go.  But it was sooo crowded.  And Khalid and<br/>\nKhidar were sleeping, and we had to put on their coats, so Jabari and I<br/>\nwanted to wait for the Verizon Center (here in D.C.) to clear out.  That was<br/>\nnot Dakari&#39;s plan.  He just broke down sobbing, and had trouble breathing as<br/>\nthough he was having a panic attack.  I asked Dakari to come and see me -<br/>\nJabari was frustrated by it all - and I gave him a hug and said &quot;it&#39;s time<br/>\nto leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot; I said &quot;the ringmaster said it was time to go, so<br/>\nyou wanted to leave?&quot; he said &quot;yes&quot;.  I hugged him again.  He was crying<br/>\npretty hard.  Then he slowly stopped and started rubbing my back like I was<br/>\nthe one upset!  LOL  What a sweet boy.<br/>\nI guess I did the right thing.  I just always wonder what the trigger is.<br/>\nWell, actually..the trigger is that something didn&#39;t happen exactly as he<br/>\nthinks it should.  Unfortunately I&#39;m not able to arrange life for Dakari so<br/>\nthat upsets don&#39;t happen.  The best I can do is help him to find a way to<br/>\ncalm down.  Jabari can&#39;t take it at all.  Sadly we&#39;ve both been known to<br/>\nshame Dakari for his reactions.  Ugh!  <br/>\nThe other thing is Dakari continues to follow everything that Safiya (9)<br/>\ndoes.  Her bookbag handle broke so she changed bookbags.  Dakari then wanted<br/>\nto change his bookbag.  But the other one he had wasn&#39;t working.  So he<br/>\nstarted to cry.  It&#39;s like that with everything.  If Safiya says her leg<br/>\nhurt because she fell, Dakari will say his arm hurts.  If Safiya says she&#39;s<br/>\nhungry, Dakari will be hungry too.  If Safiya says &quot;I&#39;m taking a shower&quot;<br/>\nDakari will say &quot;I&#39;m taking a bath&quot;.  It&#39;s as though he doesn&#39;t have his own<br/>\ninternal navigational system.  Is that okay?  It&#39;s still really annoying to<br/>\nSafiya.  She doesn&#39;t like it when she goes to do something or make something<br/>\nor draw something and Dakari does the exact same thing.  If I want to know<br/>\nwhat Dakari really likes I have to ask him first.  And then ask Safiya.  And<br/>\nthen Dakari will change his mind afterwards to whatever it was Safiya said!<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s because she older?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay..sorry for the long post.<br/>\n<br/>\nbe at peace,<br/>\nMaisha<br/>\nKhalfani Family Adventures &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/\">http://khalfanifamilyadventures.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\nEarthSpirit Journeys &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://earthspiritjourneys.blogspot.com/\">http://earthspiritjourneys.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>\naccept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will<br/>\nexperience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and<br/>\nself-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and<br/>\nnever measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we<br/>\nreject ourselves the way we are, and why we don&#39;t accept others the way they<br/>\nare.&quot; <br/>\n~ Don Miguel Ruiz <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31464,"nextTopicId":31451}}
