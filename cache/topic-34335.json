It is a soft side round <br/>\npool that is colapsable at the end of summer. To give you an idea of <br/>\nhow big it is 18&#39; by 4&#39;. The ladder that came with it is not the best <br/>\nbut it works to get in and out. Me and the kids were in the pool today <br/>\nwhile Charles was at work and they were jumping off the ladder onto the <br/>\npool toys and having a great time. Later on, when Charles was in the <br/>\npool with them, he got upset when they jumped off the ladder because if <br/>\nit breaks we cannot really afford to replace it. I can see his point <br/>\nbut I also want the kids to have the best time that they can. Does <br/>\nanyone have any suggestions about what we can do for the kids to jump <br/>\ninto the pool without dad getting mad. I was thinking about pulling <br/>\ntheir trampoline upto the side of the pool but they cannot climb over <br/>\nthe sides without all of the water rushing out into the lawn. Open to <br/>\nsuggestions. Thanks. Mary King<br/>\nwww.unschoolingsupermom.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34342,"nextTopicId":34348}}
