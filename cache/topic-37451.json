Personally, I find it <br/>\nhelpful to think about what Ray&#39;s been learning about over a period <br/>\nof several months, rather than day to day or even week by week. Its <br/>\nmuch easier to say (for example) &quot;oh, wow, he&#39;s really learned a lot <br/>\nof analytical thinking recently&quot; and then think about his various <br/>\ngames and activities to see where he might have learned that. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I worry that heÃ¢ÂÂs alone too much,&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though he&#39;s a social guy (Ray is, too, btw) its good to keep in <br/>\nmind that teens often need a lot of time by themselves. They are <br/>\nlaunching out into new territory, starting to wonder more about what <br/>\nand how they think, to ask big questions of themselves about Life, <br/>\nthe Universe, and Everything. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":35875473,"authorName":"Heather","from":"Heather &lt;heather@...&gt;","profile":"heather_200115","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] teen and only child","postDate":"1230587602","msgId":37491,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3YWEyYWU4MDgxMjI5MTM1M281Y2YyOWQ3NXRhMTZiY2ZmYjczN2IzY2ExQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE0ODYxOTM2MjczOTUxMDk2NjJAdW5rbm93bm1zZ2lkPg==","referencesHeader":"PDhDQjM3NTI3QkRDMDA1Ni1CNDAtNjkyQEZXTS1NNDMuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+CSA8OENCMzgwMUZDMkZFNkVBLTEwMjAtM0UwQE1CTEstTTAzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPgkgPDE0ODYxOTM2MjczOTUxMDk2NjJAdW5rbm93bm1zZ2lkPg=="},"prevInTopic":37478,"nextInTopic":37492,"prevInTime":37490,"nextInTime":37492,"topicId":37451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 13.
