If my oldest wanted to play with me, that was a  <br/>\ngood time to pull out some little thing that was hard to do at home  <br/>\nwith the little ones. A set of tangrams, a deck of cards, some dice,  <br/>\nsome easy little game. Crayons and paper. A camera. Books I could  <br/>\nread aloud to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d go easy on the museums - there are plenty of interesting places  <br/>\nto go with little kids for quicker, easier visits. Even just the  <br/>\ngrocery store can be awesome - try to find something new every time  <br/>\nyou go - a new kind of fruit or veggie to take home and cut open.  <br/>\nMaybe dip the veggie or fruit pieces in some paint and use them as  <br/>\nstamps.<br/>\n<br/>\nStop for a few minutes to watch at construction sites. I loved the  <br/>\nbook, &quot;Mike Mulligan&#39;s Steam Shovel&quot; when I was a kid and so I shared  <br/>\nit with my kids. I just got curious about how old that book is and  <br/>\nlooked it up - it was written in 1939, which means it was probably  <br/>\none of my mom&#39;s favorite books, too, which is why she shared it with  <br/>\nme. There are some activities on the website for it, here: &lt;http:// <br/>\nwww.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/mike_mulligan/activities.shtml&gt;  <br/>\nAND the same author write another of my all-time favorite books, one  <br/>\nI read over and over and over to my own kids, &quot;The Little House.&quot; I  <br/>\ngot a lot of ideas from these kinds of published activities - not  <br/>\nthat I used them as lessons, they were just &quot;ideas,&quot; that I might  <br/>\ntoss out there if the kids seemed open to me suggesting something to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway - one of the things &quot;I&quot; liked to do was think about great  <br/>\nkids&#39; books that related to the everyday things we were experiencing.  <br/>\nOne day we were scrounging for change and I remembered there was a  <br/>\nbook about a family of pigs that scrounged for change all over the  <br/>\nhouse. &quot;Pigs Will be Pigs&quot; is the name of the book. These days, you  <br/>\nhave Google to help you find such connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to a LOT of children&#39;s shows - musical theater, puppets, etc.  <br/>\nWe went to events intended for young children at the library. The  <br/>\nolder kids get a lot out of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also spent a lot of time in libraries with children&#39;s sections,  <br/>\nmovies, stores like IKEA with children&#39;s play areas and cafeterias.  <br/>\nThe malls often have exhibits - car show, orchids, paintings,  <br/>\njewelry, photography, and so on. We&#39;d sort of wander through those  <br/>\nsometimes. Also, we DID go to museums and exhibits and things like  <br/>\nthat, with the little ones in tow. You don&#39;t have to make a day of it  <br/>\n- we often went places for an hour or less, just enough to enjoy a  <br/>\nfew things and then we&#39;d go to a park or somewhere else to play. The  <br/>\ntrick with taking three young children places is to make it short and  <br/>\nsweet and be willing to leave soon after arriving. That&#39;s why it is  <br/>\nbetter not to make a big investment of money or travel time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Oct 16, 2007, at 12:16 AM, seccotine_ch wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; When I read about your days, you all seem pretty occupied, and your<br/>\n&gt; kids go here and there, doing sport and music and all sort of things.<br/>\n&gt; Mine don&#39;t.
