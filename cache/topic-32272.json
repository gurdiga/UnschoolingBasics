Maybe it&#39;s all in<br/>\ndefining &quot;parent comfort&quot; as opposed to strong disagreement or going <br/>\nagainst<br/>\nour values. I think as usual, talking about specific examples here vs. <br/>\nthese<br/>\nabstract ideas, will help, but right now I don&#39;t have the time to think <br/>\nof<br/>\none, so I&#39;m hoping someone else will get the conversation going.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the mom of a 20 year old, I can assure you that we have had our <br/>\nshare of parental discomfort---from drinking and drugs to sex and <br/>\nhitchhiking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deal is: *his* is NOT *my* life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI canNOT decide what he chooses and what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can potentially influence him---*especially* if I have his trust <br/>\nbecause I haven&#39;t run roughshod over him for years and years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe truly does take my advice, and he considers many angles *because* we <br/>\nhave not restricted him---*because* we have let him make REAL choices <br/>\nand not pretend ones (like in Love and Logic).<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of what he&#39;s done/wants to do has gone/goes against my personal <br/>\nvalues and/or I strongly disagree with. It really doesn&#39;t matter. I <br/>\ntrust him to make the best choice for him at this minute. He doesn&#39;t <br/>\nusually do things impulsively. (He has, in the past. But he&#39;s learned a <br/>\nLOT from those choices and seems to make better ones all the time.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of his choices, I feel sure, he feels...not necessarily <br/>\n*regret*...but that he could have made better choices. That&#39;s a GOOD <br/>\nthing to know---that you can CHOOSE to make better choices in the <br/>\nfuture. That those early, maybe rash, decisions weren&#39;t failures or <br/>\nmistakes---just learning-takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knows that we&#39;re available at all times to bounce ideas off of, and <br/>\nhe seems to be struggling less with tougher decisions/choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really hard as parents NOT to want to protect our children from <br/>\nevery single potentially harmful thing out there. But I try not to see <br/>\nthat as my job. I see my role as a facilitator---someone who will help <br/>\nmake things happen---even things I don&#39;t agree with---IF that&#39;s what he <br/>\nwants. I will try really hard to give him as many options and help him <br/>\nsee as many angles, but I have to be willing to let him make those <br/>\nchoices---and learn from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really *can&#39;t* make all the decisions for kids and expect them to <br/>\nget out on their own and make wise choices. It&#39;s like that frog-kissing <br/>\nsaying: you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince? <br/>\nYou&#39;ve got to make a lot of (often lousy) choices before you have the <br/>\nconfidence to make big, serious GOOD ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s my goal: to let him, through trial and error, learn how to think <br/>\nthrough the tough ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I choose to do all (or even a little!) of his thinking *for* <br/>\nhim, how will he learn? We all really do learn by DOING, not by being <br/>\ntold what to do!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy comfort zone is all s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out. I&#39;ve become a VERY soft <br/>\nplace to land. My in-laws, for example, are still &quot;rigid rubber;&quot; and <br/>\nwhen their kids make &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; decisions, there&#39;s no comfortable <br/>\nplace to land. They just get smacked around a SECOND time when the <br/>\nparents find out how stupid they&#39;ve been. Insult to injury---and <br/>\nprobably a punishment of some kind too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat *can* make some folks try harder to make the &quot;right&quot; decisions <br/>\nnext time---to avoid punishment or to avoid disappointing their <br/>\nparents. But that&#39;s not what I want my boys to do: I want them to make <br/>\nbetter decisions next time because they learned a better way, because <br/>\nthey thought this one out a little more, because they don&#39;t want to <br/>\ndisappoint *themselves*.<br/>\n<br/>\n*I* really shouldn&#39;t enter the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they will get my input. Because I want what&#39;s best for them. They <br/>\nknow that, because I&#39;ve demonstrated that over and over---NOT by <br/>\nprotecting them from themselves, but by helping them make choices and <br/>\nrespecting their choices, even when I didn&#39;t agree with them. (That&#39;s <br/>\npart of why they often *do* take my advice &#39;cause they know I won&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;pull rank&quot; on them---that I will support them 100%, because I *have*, <br/>\nin the past. It makes for a very, very trusting relationship.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know when I&#39;m uncomfortable. I&#39;m not shy expressing myself. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\nBut they also know I will do my best to help them achieve that goal no <br/>\nmatter what my feelings. &#39;Cause it&#39;s not my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get to make ALL the decisions I can possibly make in my own life. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t get to make theirs too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":215778715,"authorName":"Jodi Bezzola","from":"Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt;","profile":"jodibezzola","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics]Love and Logic WAS sibling fighting question","postDate":"1209888184","msgId":32363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDczODUwMS44MDM4Ny5xbUB3ZWI1NDExMC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkwZjQ4NzU2MDgwNTAzMTIwN2o2ZDk2YThhNXRhOWQzNTc1M2Q3ZjM1OTY0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32360,"nextInTopic":32367,"prevInTime":32362,"nextInTime":32364,"topicId":32272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seems to me like a huge side-effect/benefit of unschooling is for the parents to grow!  It reminds me of a conversation I had with my mom awhile ago when we were struggling to get the girls to go to bed when we wanted them to go to bed.  She said, &quot;you just have to give them a choice - as in &#39;would you like to sleep in our bed or in your own bed?&#39;, and then be firm after they choose&quot;.  So the kid picks one thing the parent has already decided is within their comfort zone and doesn&#39;t disrupt things at all in the parents&#39; tightly controlled world.  At least that&#39;s the plan.  Seems to me this is just a form of coercion.  So I replied to my mom, &#39;okay, but what if they don&#39;t want either option or they change their minds, do I really want to &#39;be firm&#39; when it causes so much unhapiness, when it means a tantrum (like duh, I wouldn&#39;t have known that would happen when I set up the whole false &#39;choice&#39; scenario).  If I just mindlessly give them regurgitated<br/>\n choices, 2 things I&#39;ve already decided wouldn&#39;t disrupt my perfect control, in my opinion that is treating them like they are brain dead, like they couldn&#39;t possibly know what they need/want, which I don&#39;t for a second believe.  So I&#39;m choosing the unschooling option, which means I have to change and grow right along with them.  I see this as not only honouring our children as being immensely capable and knowing, it also honours us parents as being capable of s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g far more than we ever thought we were capable of!

I admit. I&#39;m scared! I&#39;m very new to the idea of mindful<br/>\n&gt; parenting and unschooling, but &#39;thanks&#39; to you guys, I had to leave the<br/>\n&gt; Love and Logic seminar my husband and I went to this last weekend within<br/>\n&gt; the first hour. We had signed up for it in January, and then I joined<br/>\n&gt; this group and now I can&#39;t stand the most mainstream style of parenting<br/>\n&gt; out there. Thanks a LOT. ;)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have a five year old daughter and a two and a half year old son. My<br/>\n&gt; question is, how does mindful parenting deal with sibling fights at this<br/>\n&gt; age. Like, when my daughter takes a toy my son is playing with and<br/>\n&gt; when he obviously wants it back, she ignores his requests, whether he<br/>\n&gt; asks for it verbally or via screaming. Among the many responses I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had, many of them not ones I&#39;m proud of...the one that has worked most<br/>\n&gt; often is asking her if he sounds like he&#39;s happy or unhappy. And then<br/>\n&gt; seeing if she can think of anything that may make him happy. But I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t see her wanting to stop making him upset in the first place. Can<br/>\n&gt; someone assure me that this will change at some point in her growing up<br/>\n&gt; life? They get along well a lot of the time...it&#39;s that 10% that&#39;s got<br/>\n&gt; me stumped.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I wonder if others can share their experience with their kids...<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jill<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hamletstreet.com\">http://www.hamletstreet.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32380,"nextTopicId":32395}}
