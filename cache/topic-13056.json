Here&#39;s how they worded the topic for <br/>\nyou to rant on:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve probably heard of home schooling, where parents teach their kids <br/>\nat home using prepared materials and curriculum guides you can buy in <br/>\nstores. But some parents are trying something called, &quot;unschooling.&quot; <br/>\nThat&#39;s teaching kids at home without any time or curriculum structure. <br/>\nKids learn what they want to learn when they want to to learn it. Should <br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; be legal? What obligations should parents have to meet? <br/>\nDoes it even sound like something that could work? Should kids be able <br/>\nto decide what they study?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello???!!  What did kids do BEFORE there was an organized school system <br/>\nin this country???  Seems like the world came pretty far without <br/>\norganized school systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nKristie in VA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13040,"nextTopicId":13073}}
