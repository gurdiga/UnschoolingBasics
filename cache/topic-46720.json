Other kids are confusing, they don&#39;t have adult communication skills or adult empathy so they can&#39;t respond to a childs needs, wants and hopes - only their own!

Taking them elsewhere might help. Another issues that may be playing out is that having another child come into his home and use his things could be really stressful for your son. Can you confine the babysitting to one room in the house or a garage or something, so that your son can have &quot;his&quot; space and things kept safe? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s not possible, you may have to strictly manage the visiting child, keep him out of bedrooms and personal spaces and manage his time, too with activities and tv and whatnot. That could be awkward while also trying to unschool your own son, especially if it means your attention is divided between the two. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be better for your relationship with your son to find him a more-or-less congenial baby-sitter during the day and work on having a better relationship when you&#39;re home. It&#39;s not helping either of you if your home shouting, and giving lots of attention to someone other than him :( As your son gets older and better able to be home alone, you may be able to re-arrange your work schedule so that you&#39;re working mostly while he&#39;s sleeping or playing on the computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling takes a clever use of resources - and its not always do-able with the resources you have at the moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277213997,"authorName":"Karen Swanay","from":"Karen Swanay &lt;luvbullbreeds@...&gt;","profile":"kswanay1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: curbing behavior","postDate":"1306184486","msgId":46763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGlrdVppQUI5Tk5WRVdMaWdoU0hWVEpqMHIzR2dBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDR0cm5zdWFyd3Jnanc1eHcxbGkwaXgyZC4xMzA2MTYyOTQyMTM1QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDR0cm5zdWFyd3Jnanc1eHcxbGkwaXgyZC4xMzA2MTYyOTQyMTM1QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46762,"nextInTopic":46769,"prevInTime":46762,"nextInTime":46764,"topicId":46720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"****** I definitely have to admit that part of the problem is me, okay.. much of the problem.

I am easily frustrated, irritated, etc. and not just with my<br/>\nson but with many people. I don&#39;t handle stress easily and in a way I&#39;m sort<br/>\nof spoiled and like getting my way. But I&#39;m trying to change that.<br/>\n*******<br/>\nLet&#39;s get this down to the bones...<br/>\n<br/>\nYOU like to get YOUR way and when you don&#39;t...you over-react, punish others,<br/>\nand are generally horrible to be around.  You admit that and that&#39;s great.<br/>\n(I&#39;m not picking on you BTW...my list of unflattering traits would be<br/>\nsimilarly ugly to see.)  You are trying to change that and that is also<br/>\nGREAT.  Good for you!  It will make a huge difference in most areas of your<br/>\nlife.  But...at the same time, you are however old you are, I&#39;m assuming<br/>\nover 20...and you still act like a petulant child, while expecting a 5 yr<br/>\nold to behave like a 40yr old.  You expect better behavior from HIM than you<br/>\ndo of yourself.  Don&#39;t respond to that.  Think about it.  And the next time<br/>\nsomething horks you off, remember that I said it that way.  &quot;You expect<br/>\nbetter behavior from a 5 yr old than you do yourself.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I am going to say is that in a given moment, we all have<br/>\nchoices of how to behave and each of us, little kids and adults alike<br/>\nsometimes make the better choice and sometimes the worst one.  Your little<br/>\nguy is pretty much just firing off as he&#39;s supposed to.  Kids are selfish<br/>\nlittle critters.  They are SUPPOSED to be.  It&#39;s how we survive.  (My<br/>\ndaughter spent almost 4 years in a Chinese orphanage....she will take ANY<br/>\nblanket in the house she can get her hands on...she is about to turn<br/>\n7....and will take all the protein she can grab at meals.  Because in a<br/>\nChinese orphanage, if you can stay warm and get fed, you won&#39;t die.  It&#39;s a<br/>\nharsh reality that I think most &quot;Westerners&quot; and I use that term loosely<br/>\ndon&#39;t really &quot;get&quot;.  All kids are ego-centric.  Don&#39;t try to correct it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not an error.  YOU though, should be willing to martyr yourself for<br/>\nyour child.  So in a moment, assume he&#39;s doing the best he can, and you try<br/>\nto do better.  That&#39;s the bottom line.  It isn&#39;t easy and it won&#39;t always<br/>\nwork, and sometimes you&#39;ll completely mess it up.  And that&#39;s typical.<br/>\nProgress is NEVER a straight line, it generally moves forward but it twists<br/>\nand turns and snakes about.<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nMy problem is what do I do so I don&#39;t have to repeat myself a million times.<br/>\nI feel myself turning into my mother sometimes with my parenting and I want<br/>\nto steer from that.<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nHoney, that&#39;s parenting.  He&#39;s FIVE.  This is normal.  And if you are saying<br/>\nthe same thing over and over, you need to rethink the entire situation.  You<br/>\nare messing it up.  He&#39;s going to be and do what he is and what he needs.<br/>\nYou need to figure out how the &quot;thing&quot; you are remarking about over and over<br/>\ncan be reworked, avoided, embraced, or seen in a different light.  But<br/>\nremember he is FIVE.  Not 25.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not responsible for you turning into your mother.  You are.  If you&#39;ve<br/>\nread here enough you&#39;ve seen others talk about not wanting to parent the way<br/>\nthey were parented.  That&#39;s common, and we all struggle with it.  It is<br/>\nsomething I struggle with from time to time and I&#39;ve been &quot;doing this&quot; for<br/>\noh...4yrs?  I don&#39;t know how long.  I suspect it is something many people<br/>\nhere have come up from time to time.  But it is about YOU controlling your<br/>\nbehavior and making better choices.  It is not for him to &quot;toe the line&quot; so<br/>\nthat you don&#39;t have to &quot;go there&quot; you know?  (Again, I know you are trying.<br/>\nAnd believe me when I say I offer this as just a plain way to look at things<br/>\nand I offer it with the best of intentions and with care, concern,<br/>\nunconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nSome issues that I have are ones I have listed but also my son&#39;s father and<br/>\nI are not together so that is sometimes a challenge as he doesn&#39;t<br/>\ncommunicate well with me about our son. My son is a very smart little boy<br/>\nfor his age. Very verbal and just very smart in general. Most people think<br/>\nhe&#39;s 5. He sometimes acts angrily toward his toys and such and I think that<br/>\nhas to do with the sort of television he has been exposed to at his father&#39;s<br/>\nand also the frustration I don&#39;t hide very well under stress that worries me<br/>\ntoo. I have tried asking him to calm down and play nicely with his toys, etc<br/>\netc but to no avail.<br/>\n*****<br/>\nOK.  Here&#39;s the &quot;deal&quot;.  I am the child of divorced parents.  It SUCKS.  The<br/>\nadults are all warm and fuzzy about it after some time passes, and they get<br/>\non with their lives, and get remarried, begin dating, make new kids, bring<br/>\nnew kids in the home etc...and it still SUCKS for the kids.  What you and<br/>\nyour ex did (regardless of the circumstances and I don&#39;t care to know them<br/>\nor want to hear about blame etc) is cruel and heartless to a child.  He&#39;s<br/>\nFIVE.  How can he process why daddy isn&#39;t there anymore?  You say he&#39;s<br/>\nsmart.  He may be smart but he&#39;s not emotionally mature and cannot possibly<br/>\nunderstand how or why this is a good deal.  He is essentially homeless.  YOU<br/>\nstay in your place.  His father stays in his place...but your little FIVE<br/>\nyear old son, has no home any longer.  He has to drag a suitcase behind him<br/>\nuntil he&#39;s old enough to leave.  What if when he&#39;s at his Dad&#39;s house he<br/>\nwants a toy that is at YOUR house?  He can&#39;t have it.  What if while with<br/>\nyou he wants a hug from his dad?  He can&#39;t have it.  Is he watching the two<br/>\nof you carry on with other people?  So, he&#39;s got less attention from his<br/>\nparents and they are paying attention to other people?  WHAT?  I&#39;d be RIGHT<br/>\nPISSED OFF.  Stop blaming TV and take the blame.  YOU did this.  His father<br/>\ndid this.  And yes, there are reasons where it is justified, and situations<br/>\nwhere one spouse can&#39;t stop it from happening.  I get that.  But I also know<br/>\nhow it feels to be that kid.  And there is hurt and anger and NO ONE CARES.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things you could do to help with his anger and frustration and the<br/>\namount of hurt and sadness he carries but I can&#39;t get into them at this<br/>\ntime.  Probably if you archive dive you can find some.  But give the kid<br/>\nroom to express his hurt.  He&#39;s been deeply wounded.  I just turned 40 and<br/>\nI&#39;m still keenly aware of much of the pain I had to endure growing up.  I<br/>\nthink you have to suck up this kid&#39;s anger and be a safe place for him to<br/>\nexpress it.  Don&#39;t say mean things about his father.  EVER.  NOT ONE THING<br/>\nEVER.  EVER.  I can&#39;t even articulate how deeply painful THAT crap is to a<br/>\nchild.  Don&#39;t do it.  Get a journal and write it down.  Vent with a<br/>\ngirlfriend WHEN YOUR BOY IS WITH HIS DAD.  Whatever...but NEVER in front of<br/>\nhim ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last thing I&#39;m going to do is post something from The Onion...it&#39;s a<br/>\nhumorous website that appears &quot;newsy&quot; it&#39;s a safe link but it&#39;s short so<br/>\nI&#39;ll put it here.

Don&#39;t you know some<br/>\npeople who really rub you the wrong way?  (I know of a person who makes me incapable of<br/>\ncooking! Imagine that! I am a Super good Cook!) The same could be with these two little<br/>\nones. We have it here too, with Ariella and her three cousins of which one is the<br/>\n&#39;culprit&#39;. They just cannot be in the same room without major clashing of energies. It is<br/>\nnot personal. Just fricking energies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy solution is to not allow the other children near Ari in my home or have someone else -<br/>\nnot me, as I freak out, too - &#39;her&#39; energies and mine just are at a dissonance!  - to be<br/>\non hand at all times with Ari and the others together. I could see the discordance when I<br/>\nlooked at the Human Design Charts of the children involved. It is not that I don&#39;t want<br/>\nthe other children around. It is just when they are in the same room with Ari that sparks<br/>\nfly. With Maika this is not happening. So, either Ari has to be taken out of the fry or<br/>\nthe others and since Ari is my real grandchild and the others are not (!)  Ari&#39;s needs<br/>\nhave a higher priority in my personal living space.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Human Design has given me so much insight already in becoming a more understanding<br/>\nand a more radical unschooling parent/grandparent with family and strangers alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance , Ari (as well as I) are energetically open in a certain way where most of<br/>\nthe people we come into contact with have a Definition of Energy. When Ari and I re alone<br/>\ntogether &#39;life&#39; flows&#39; easily. When any one or more of the other join us things start to<br/>\nbecome &#39;tense&#39; and discordonant. Our solution at present is to take ourselves - Ari and<br/>\nmyself - away from the others, until we become aware and stable enough within to handle<br/>\nthese energies.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, parenting is so much more than feeding, and educating (teaching the basics of reading,<br/>\nwriting and arithmetic) and following (societal) rules. Unschooling seemed to be<br/>\nrelatively simple when I decided to get my youngest out of the rat race and take care of<br/>\nhis soul instead of his &#39;education&#39; some 12 years ago. With my grandchildren I am much<br/>\nmore aware of the unmet needs that grow into real (health) issues within such a blistering<br/>\nshort time already. The energetic interplay between two people is already quite intricate.<br/>\nallow another or more people to join the energetic mixing and situations really get out of<br/>\nhand in no time at all. That is my personal experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, there is a way to handle such situations. BUT it needs a lot of conscious awareness<br/>\nand being in the Now and able to acty/react/respond appropriately. Quite a walk on<br/>\neggshells at times. :-) And my grandchildren are much more forgiving than I was at their<br/>\nage, I am sure.

I recently left my job to stay home with my son and I have offered to watch my friends two little boys one of which is my sons age. Whenever his friend comes over to play his whole attitude changes and he fights with him and misbehaves. I have tried the nice approach, I have tried the distracting approach. Nothing is working. I am at my wits end and about to tell my friend she needs to find someone else to watch her boys. But if I do that I will have to go back to work, defeating the whole purpose of staying home. I don&#39;t know how to get him to play nice. Its not like his friend is mean to him, he&#39;s not. My son is very bossy and mean towards him and I&#39;m sick and tired of yelling at him. Does anyone else experience a change in behavior when their kids are around other kids? Should I be doing something else?

When he was really little, I could hold a pillow or cushion and he&#39;d punch it. As he got bigger, so did his punches. So, we got an inflatable thing (the kind that is weighted to return upright every time) until it got to where he could hit it hard enough that it would &quot;surrender&quot; and stay down. Then we invested in an adjustable height boxing style &quot;peanut bag&quot; and kid size boxing gloves. We&#39;ve since replaced the gloves with the martial arts style sparring gloves (he prefers the freedom in his fingers). Sometimes he uses it to vent frustration, other times he just needs to exert those muscles. When he was a wee one and we had precious little space (we lived in apartments until he was 3.5), we had a mini trampoline he&#39;d bounce on while he watched TV and such, so he could get that movement in when the outdoors wasn&#39;t a good idea (9 pm on a snowy New England winter night for example - even HE didn&#39;t want to be out in that). At around 5, he loved challenging himself on carrying groceries - he&#39;d ask how much something weighed and then carry it as far as he could (for example, a gallon of liquid like water or milk is approx 8 lbs). By age 7 or 8 he could carry 2 full gallons of milk up a flight of stairs - by his own choice, if he decided he didn&#39;t want to do that on a given day, us grown-ups would handle it. Now, at nigh 13, he helps us haul bins of stuff when we&#39;re setting up our space at craft fairs - he can navigate the hand truck stacked 3 bins high himself!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s always had lots of physical energy needs - our task was to help him meet those needs in ways that fit the environment at a given time. For instance, chitchat time after church worship time wasn&#39;t a great time to be running about (too many people and chairs and such, including elderly folks who are a bit fragile). So, sometimes I&#39;d bounce him like a basketball - LOL I know it sounds odd - I&#39;d hold my hand palm down parallel to the floor a few inches higher than his head and he&#39;d bounce up and down so that I could just pat his head as if his head were a ball I was bouncing; other times (and this got a few odd looks but it was useful so it stayed, the odds looks went away eventually) I&#39;d hold my two hands in front of me to make a wall (palms forward, thumbs crossed in back out of the way) and he&#39;d punch at it, trying to &#39;break&#39; the wall; I&#39;d gradually &#39;give way&#39; after a few punches and when his hand finally broke through, I&#39;d kiss his knuckles and rebuild the wall and start again. When he was a little older (maybe 5-6 yrs old), I&#39;d hold my hands out and call out lefts and rights like a boxing coach and he&#39;d use whichever hand I called out (so it took a bit more focus and concentration to keep up). If there was a little space, I&#39;d prepare myself and he&#39;d take a short run and slam into me, trying to get me off balance - but I know how to absorb the impact so I&#39;d catch him, kiss his head and let him go try again. At home, I&#39;d sit on the side of the bed and he&#39;d run and try to knock me backward. I&#39;d catch him and give him a kiss and he&#39;d try again. Sometimes he&#39;d knock me off balance (or I&#39;d fall backward myself) and we&#39;d have a bit of a wrestle. Other times, he&#39;d try to catch my arm and I&#39;d try to keep it away from him. Now, as he&#39;s older, we do &quot;Karate Kid&quot; type sparring (nothing formally martial arts, just stuff I picked up from watching Karate Kid and basic self defense type moves) and the goal is to tap the other person&#39;s shoulder. Hmm thinking through all of these physical things I&#39;m seeing a pattern - not only are they using lots of muscles (especially for DS his upper body) but there&#39;s also an aspect of physical contact and focused attention from me (or from DH, though his physical limitations affected what stuff he could handle). Those are also important - sometimes &quot;acting out&quot; is actually &quot;hey, I want your 100% attention, not just &quot;uh huh uh huh&quot; while you&#39;re half listening and reading a magazine&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

Get 3 adults together and you&#39;ll get 4 or 5 answers so how is a wee one supposed to understand that? Don&#39;t set him up for problems - if he can unlock the door and exit and that&#39;s a hazard (when DS was that young we lived in an apartment complex so I &#39;get&#39; that part of it), get a deadbolt lock and install it way up high at the top of the door frame and lock it at night (a keyed one so that he can&#39;t open it without the key that you keep safe); if being in a bounce house gets him wired up (as it does many kids), maybe graciously excuse yourselves from bounce house parties for a time; and so on. You say you have to keep repeating yourself. Maybe stop and think: if someone repeatedly tells -you- something but you don&#39;t get what they&#39;re asking (as in &quot;Play nicely&quot;), what does their repeatedly telling you to do it accomplish? Everyone gets frustrated - they&#39;re frustrated because you&#39;re not complying, you&#39;re frustrated because you don&#39;t understand and someone is upset with you for a reason you don&#39;t get. Think about defining what it is you&#39;re asking - does &quot;play nicely&quot; mean &quot;turn the volume of your play down so I can hear the news&quot;; &quot;please don&#39;t throw the wooden blocks at the television&quot;; &quot;bouncing those pointy plastic toys off the couch cushions is a potential eye injury hazard and it&#39;s tearing the fabric as well&quot;; etc. Too often we tell kids to &quot;play nicely&quot; without giving them any idea what we mean by that - so they play in a manner that is fun for them, that&#39;s often the best definition of &quot;nice&quot; they have at the time. Until somewhere near puberty, kids live in a very concrete world, it is or it isn&#39;t there&#39;s little shading. Use specifics &quot;Please keep your Legos off the couch - it hurts my bum when I sit on them accidentally and they might get squashed by my bum. It&#39;s okay to have them on the floor or the table.&quot; (oh yeah and make sure that if there&#39;s a &quot;don&#39;t&quot; involved that you include the &quot;do&quot; - you CAN play with them over here but not over there)<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It&#39;s supposed to be.  Kids are testing<br/>\ntheir boundaries, figuring out what they can and can&#39;t do, seeing what<br/>\nreally bothers you.  There&#39;s also a lot of joy as your child grows up, but<br/>\nwith that comes their push for independence, and being kids, they don&#39;t do<br/>\nit in ways that are always comfortable for their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy very lovely son drives me insane on a daily basis.  What I&#39;ve come to<br/>\nrealize is that the only person I can control in the situation is myself<br/>\nand my reaction to him.  He is not malicious in his behavior, he is just<br/>\ntrying to get his needs met, and he&#39;s at his worst when I am not making<br/>\nsure is world is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n3-4 year olds have so little power in life, they are told what to do by<br/>\neveryone, they have little ability to dictate what they will do, when they<br/>\nwill do it.  So they take power when they play, maybe with aggressive<br/>\nplay, or being aggressive toward other kids.  Instead of repeating<br/>\nyourself a million times (truthfully if you&#39;ve said it more than a couple<br/>\ntimes maybe repeating it beyond that isn&#39;t really working and it&#39;s time to<br/>\nchange tactics) and trying to stem the aggression, maybe reflecting it<br/>\nback and really pay attention because you&#39;ll probably learn more about<br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on in the little head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree with taking responsibility when you do mess up.  I mess up<br/>\npretty much daily, and I&#39;ve been quite upfront with Finn at times that<br/>\nmommy was completely out of line.<br/>\n<br/>\nI too tend to be negative about my son, so sometimes I step back and think<br/>\nof all of he wonderful characteristics: that he loves his family with<br/>\nintensity, that he can build amazing creations out of blocks, that he&#39;s a<br/>\nnice playmate and a good friend, that his whole body can shake with joy<br/>\nand that he completely and utterly fills up my soul with his love.  So<br/>\nwhat if I want to strangle him here and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think you need to child-proof your front door.  My son also can let<br/>\nhimself out of the house and there have been days that I&#39;m heading out to<br/>\nwork and he&#39;s running after me and my wife is still in bed.  Not good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s no fun to look at yourself as a parent and see failure, but at least<br/>\nyou see it and that means you&#39;re paying attention and that you care about<br/>\nbeing better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I can completely relate to both of your posts. I am a stay at home mother<br/>\n&gt; to two<br/>\n&gt; boys my first son is turning 5 in July ( he is the one I have a lot of the<br/>\n&gt; same<br/>\n&gt; problems with) and my other son just turned one in April and I can already<br/>\n&gt; tell<br/>\n&gt; they are going to have two very different personalities. But to get back<br/>\n&gt; to the<br/>\n&gt; issues outlined. My older son North, becomes very easily frustrated with<br/>\n&gt; his<br/>\n&gt; environment from getting dressed to his toys to other children at times as<br/>\n&gt; well.<br/>\n&gt; His personality in this way is at times completely overwhelming and huge<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; have found that his over reactive behavior grates down on me and if I am<br/>\n&gt; in any<br/>\n&gt; way stressed about anything (mostly things having nothing to do with him)<br/>\n&gt; I can<br/>\n&gt; lose my temper with his easily frustrated outbursts very quickly leaving<br/>\n&gt; me<br/>\n&gt; feeling totally even more stressed and guilty because I want so badly to<br/>\n&gt; be able<br/>\n&gt; to show him compassion and model a way for him to have self control.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I find the most important thing I do is to apologize to him when I have<br/>\n&gt; really<br/>\n&gt; gone off the handle. And let him know that I am human too and sometimes<br/>\n&gt; lose<br/>\n&gt; control emotionally as well, this puts us on the same level in a way, and<br/>\n&gt; hep<br/>\n&gt; him to understand that I am not perfect either. iT helps put things back<br/>\n&gt; in<br/>\n&gt; perspective for both of us. I know that what I really need is take care of<br/>\n&gt; myself so that i can go to that more comprehensive and intuitive place<br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; dealing with him and his large distinct wonderful creative and totally<br/>\n&gt; awesome<br/>\n&gt; personality. That is truly I think the answer: I need to care for myself<br/>\n&gt; more so<br/>\n&gt; that I am not reacting with nerves and from stress and so that I can find<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; creative place within me where I can really coach him through to the other<br/>\n&gt; side.<br/>\n&gt; I know it exists because Ive done it before on several occasions we just<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; into bad routines some times.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Musc love and support to all you mamas!!<br/>\n&gt;  Yours Truly,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jennifer Lynn Kaminski<br/>\n&gt; Certified PPTM and Birth Doula<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt; From: Jessica &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nathansmommy1020@...\">nathansmommy1020@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Sat, May 21, 2011 7:20:00 PM<br/>\n&gt; Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: curbing behavior<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I definitely have to admit that part of the problem is me, okay.. much of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; problem. I am easily frustrated, irritated, etc. and not just with my son<br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; with many people. I don&#39;t handle stress easily and in a way I&#39;m sort of<br/>\n&gt; spoiled<br/>\n&gt; and like getting my way. But I&#39;m trying to change that. An example of my<br/>\n&gt; son<br/>\n&gt; driving me insane would be today, for instance, we went to a birthday<br/>\n&gt; party and<br/>\n&gt; he had a hard time keeping his hands to himself. He was hitting and<br/>\n&gt; grabbing and<br/>\n&gt; pushing inside the bounce house and I asked him numerous times to stop. Or<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; morning when I woke up to find out he had gone outside to play while we<br/>\n&gt; were<br/>\n&gt; still in bed. Mind you, if we lived in a rural area like we plan to this<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t be such an issue but right now we live in a townhouse surrounded<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; lots of people and I just worry about his safety. I know and can admit<br/>\n&gt; that some<br/>\n&gt; of things I get upset about most people wouldn&#39;t. And I have been working<br/>\n&gt; on<br/>\n&gt; that. My problem is what do I do so I don&#39;t have to repeat myself a<br/>\n&gt; million<br/>\n&gt; times. I feel myself turning into my mother sometimes with my parenting<br/>\n&gt; and I<br/>\n&gt; want to steer from that. I have read this group&#39;s posts for awhile and<br/>\n&gt; read up a<br/>\n&gt; little on unschooling and the parenting aspect of it and it totally<br/>\n&gt; intrigues<br/>\n&gt; me. Some issues that I have are ones I have listed but also my son&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; father and<br/>\n&gt; I are not together so that is sometimes a challenge as he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; communicate<br/>\n&gt; well with me about our son. My son is a very smart little boy for his age.<br/>\n&gt; Very<br/>\n&gt; verbal and just very smart in general. Most people think he&#39;s 5. He<br/>\n&gt; sometimes<br/>\n&gt; acts angrily toward his toys and such and I think that has to do with the<br/>\n&gt; sort<br/>\n&gt; of television he has been exposed to at his father&#39;s and also the<br/>\n&gt; frustration I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t hide very well under stress that worries me too. I have tried asking<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; to calm down and play nicely with his toys, etc etc but to no avail.<br/>\n&gt; I hope I didn&#39;t ramble on too much but I have seen the great advice many<br/>\n&gt; of you<br/>\n&gt; have given so I&#39;m hoping someone can help me in the right direction to not<br/>\n&gt; only<br/>\n&gt; the world of unschooling but to better parenting. thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;marbleface@...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; 3.5 years old -- no I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a total loss yet. :)<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Give us a specific example of you being frustrated.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Then we can tell you to let go, slow down, stop caring about whatever it<br/>\n&gt;&gt; is<br/>\n&gt;&gt;that you think the 3.5-year-old should care about, etc.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you don&#39;t need to go through all that.

I found it was important to keep those traits in mind any time we were thinking of joining other families - are the other kids going to be robust enough to deal with mine? It doesn&#39;t do Anyone any good to have one kid become the &quot;terror&quot; of a party or group play, but a very physical kid will turn into a terror quickly out of pure enthusiasm. When kids are excited, they have much less impulse control - an excited 3yo probably has none at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, I&#39;d stay away from groups in &quot;bounce houses&quot; and similar environments for awhile. Maybe avoid all parties for now. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect a young child to contain his natural enthusiasm in an exciting space like that. When Ray was little, we found it better to stick to older playmates and only one at a time - parties were generally disasters so we learned to avoid them and really, other families were just as glad. We burned too many bridges too soon by trying to make sure he was included and have been careful not to make the same mistake with Mo. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook for one-on-one play opportunities with kids who are a little older than yours - or a Lot older, if you can find older kids, teens or even adults who want to pal around with your little guy. That was a great help with Ray. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Or this morning when I woke up to find out he had gone outside to play while we were still in bed. Mind you, if we lived in a rural area like we plan to this wouldn&#39;t be such an issue but right now we live in a townhouse surrounded by lots of people and I just worry about his safety.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the yelling and explaining in the world won&#39;t stop that - and punishment will only guarantee that he sneaks out quietly. You&#39;re better off joining in his play and reminding him to let you know where he is. With young children who are still artlessly egocentric, it can help to say &quot;I love you so much and want to be where you are&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m your mommy and love looking at you&quot; rather than trying to explain about safety. It makes Sense to a toddler that his mom wants to be where he is out of love - safety is too esoteric. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he gets up early, plan on getting up early, too. That&#39;s your best defense. If that&#39;s not a sure thing right now, make sure there&#39;s plenty of fun in the house - things he can get to right away and start playing, or watching tv or whatever he likes first thing in the morning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;My problem is what do I do so I don&#39;t have to repeat myself a million times.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nStep away from the idea that your words will have any validity to him. Listen and look more and learn from what you observe so that you can set him up to succeed. Right now you&#39;re setting him up to fail and bemoaning that fact - you&#39;ll be sooooo much happier once you turn that around.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate situations where you don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to yell or repeat or explain - but to do that will take some direct action on your part and it will seem awkward for awhile. That&#39;s natural. You&#39;ve been led to expect that you can parent with your voice and its Not True! Parenting is hands-on and immediate, especially with a more energetic child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I have tried asking him to calm down and play nicely with his toys, etc etc but to no avail.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about that for a moment - do You like being told to calm down when the world isn&#39;t living up to your expectations? I don&#39;t ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nRather than saying &quot;play nice&quot; stop and consider what he&#39;s  needing in the moment. Does he need a snack? Some attention? Those are good things to try if you&#39;re not sure - but don&#39;t ask! Bring him a plate of goodies and get down on the floor with him. Can you play too? Get involved with his fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, does it Matter if he&#39;s rough with his toys? With two feisty kids, I&#39;ve learned to buy things with the knowledge they could be broken - so things need to be impressively sturdy or cheap, and on my budget I aim for cheap. Our few special toys I take charge of their care - electric trains, for instance - with the understanding that my kids will grow into being able to do it themselves. And they have! I still keep track of game pieces and magazines so pieces aren&#39;t lost and pages aren&#39;t torn, but I rarely worry about general toys or furniture these days. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;He sometimes acts angrily toward his toys and such and I think that has to do with the sort of television he has been exposed to at his father&#39;s and also the frustration I don&#39;t hide very well <br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will have far more of an impact on his behavior than tv. While kids do try things they see, they&#39;re far, far more influenced by real people than imaginary characters in books, movies, and television. What&#39;s he doing - smashing things? It doesn&#39;t take a tv for kids to do that. I have a pretty &quot;alternative&quot; lifestyle and know plenty of no-tv kids. They still smash things, I promise ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son is very emotional, it could be good for him to work out some of his feelings with his toys. It might help you to join in! <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, if he&#39;s very physical it could be that what you&#39;re calling &quot;anger&quot; is just excess energy. For instance, Ray used to smash things. It Looked angry, but when he was given a lot of chances to use the same muscle groups - whacking weeds, pounding with a hammer, throwing rocks, and even smashing things in the garbage - he wasn&#39;t nearly as hard on his toys or the furniture. He didn&#39;t need to be told &quot;calm down&quot; - just the opposite! He needed to learn safe, acceptible ways to deal with all his pent up energy. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs he&#39;s gottten older, he&#39;s able to use that as a tool when he&#39;s angry. He&#39;ll go chop wood or pound out his anger at his forge, or work out with his fire-staff. He Still needs to do things that use the big muscles of his shoulders and back regularly - that&#39;s how he&#39;s built.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good rule of thumb with little kids is to look at what they like to do - and especially what they can&#39;t seem to stop doing - in terms of which big muscle groups are being used. Some kids need lots of arm action, others lots of leg action. And some need to use the big chest muscles a lot - kids who yell a lot will benefit from things like blowing bubbles, balloons, harmonicas (or a dijeridoo, those are Great for kids and not nearly as hard on adult ears). Kids who do a lot of touching may need more tactile stimulation - give them more things to touch, smear and squish. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: curbing behavior","postDate":"1306067540","msgId":46749,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlyYXZvayttZWhxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyOWhiMCs3cWljQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46748,"nextInTopic":46750,"prevInTime":46748,"nextInTime":46750,"topicId":46720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Have you ever been in a bounce house?

Add an absent father and 3.5-year-old child and who knows what else and your days are full and tiring and can be frustrating. Now add constant picking at the 3.5-year-old about what sounds like perfectly normal behavior to me. Too much angst and a negative atmosphere.

I know that what I really need is take care of <br/>\nmyself so that i can go to that more comprehensive and intuitive place when <br/>\ndealing with him and his large distinct wonderful creative and totally awesome <br/>\npersonality.

I am easily frustrated, irritated, etc. and not just with my son but with many people. I don&#39;t handle stress easily and in a way I&#39;m sort of spoiled and like getting my way. But I&#39;m trying to change that. An example of my son driving me insane would be today, for instance, we went to a birthday party and he had a hard time keeping his hands to himself. He was hitting and grabbing and pushing inside the bounce house and I asked him numerous times to stop. Or this morning when I woke up to find out he had gone outside to play while we were still in bed. Mind you, if we lived in a rural area like we plan to this wouldn&#39;t be such an issue but right now we live in a townhouse surrounded by lots of people and I just worry about his safety. I know and can admit that some of things I get upset about most people wouldn&#39;t. And I have been working on that. My problem is what do I do so I don&#39;t have to repeat myself a million times. I feel myself turning into my mother sometimes with my parenting and I want to steer from that. I have read this group&#39;s posts for awhile and read up a little on unschooling and the parenting aspect of it and it totally intrigues me. Some issues that I have are ones I have listed but also my son&#39;s father and I are not together so that is sometimes a challenge as he doesn&#39;t communicate well with me about our son. My son is a very smart little boy for his age. Very verbal and just very smart in general. Most people think he&#39;s 5. He sometimes acts angrily toward his toys and such and I think that has to do with the sort of television he has been exposed to at his father&#39;s and also the frustration I don&#39;t hide very well under stress that worries me too. I have tried asking him to calm down and play nicely with his toys, etc etc but to no avail.<br/>\nI hope I didn&#39;t ramble on too much but I have seen the great advice many of you have given so I&#39;m hoping someone can help me in the right direction to not only the world of unschooling but to better parenting. thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; 3.5 years old -- no I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a total loss yet. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Give us a specific example of you being frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then we can tell you to let go, slow down, stop caring about whatever it is that you think the 3.5-year-old should care about, etc. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you don&#39;t need to go through all that.

Saying yes more, finding alternatives that work for everyone, remembering to take a deep breath Before you explode... those will all get easier with time and effort. It also gets easier when you start seeing &quot;results&quot; and that&#39;s something that&#39;s actually easier for parents who pull kids out of school than folks who unschool &quot;from the start&quot;. It&#39;s a Big Deal to see a kid who has been frustrated and unhappy start to shine again! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have one of each - a kid who went through homeschooling, school, and then unschooling - and one who has been unschooled &quot;from the start&quot;. It helped me when my daughter was little to read stories of families with slightly older kids and see how things work out over time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;so by the fall, I would<br/>\n&gt; Like to have some idea of what we are &quot;doing&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Okay, so here&#39;s the catch ;) kids change. And with a second on the way, your circumstances will change in big ways, too. So even if you knew what you are doing right now, that may not help you once the baby gets here - and if everything runs smoothly at first you Still won&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to be doing once the new baby starts to walk and gets into the older child&#39;s stuff. That&#39;s a big transitional time, and you&#39;ll find yourself deschooling all over again, even if you feel &quot;done&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt has helped me to cultivate a sense of excitement and fascination with the changes in my life, and my kids&#39; lives.

It&#39;s not efficient if it generates resentment and resistance in someone else. It&#39;s not efficient if I get bogged down &quot;explaining&quot; why my way is the best. Stopping to pay attention to what my kids want and think and feel often *is* more efficient in terms of the amount of energy it takes to get something done. The payback for time and attention and kindness is fantastic!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I also feel so rushed, due to some circumstances with two of the kids being disabled, another being very involved in outside-of-the-home activities.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was something that got better when I stepped away from my old ideas of efficiency. Plan more time into all your transitions - time to do but also time to connect and time to be. It *seems* inefficient if you ignore things like emotional needs, but it doesn&#39;t work out that way because emotional needs will come into play at inconvenient times (when you&#39;re tired, hungry, rushed etc your emotional reserves are lower) and shatter your illusions of efficiency. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have to say, too, that I find it frustrating with the people who allow their kids to continually expect deep explanations of why they have to do something.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all kids want big, deep explanations and will tune them out. But children who don&#39;t get enough attention will sometimes clamor for more explanations as a way of getting attention! So its important to Give that attention, to meet the real need so that your child isn&#39;t resorting to tactics to get his needs met. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids, though, are passionate to know the whys and/or hows of the world. That&#39;s marvelous! but it can be tiring, too. If your child is always asking, asking, asking, look for more resources. Can you show him or her how to use the internet? Rent more movies? Get more channels of tv? Find more playfellows who are old enough to answer alllllll those questions? Other people can be vital resources, especially with a very social child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;or when to let them keep &quot;playing&quot; me to delay the inevitable that they have to get done.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are setting up situations where things &quot;have to get done&quot; you will get resistance - but there&#39;s really very very little in the world that &quot;has to&quot; be done. There are worlds of options. Parents sometimes use taking care of kids as an example of a &quot;has to&quot; but even there, I parent across a divorce and know just how little &quot;has to&quot; happen. We *choose* to value our childrens&#39; needs and wants, feelings and dreams - its good to see choices in your own life so that you can see the reasoning behind offering choices to children. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re concerned about efficiency, take your children out of the housework equation. Seriously, child labor is terribly inefficient and does not guarantee adult proficiency in housekeeping, so drop that. Invite their help, but don&#39;t require it - and value they help they give, even when it doesn&#39;t meet up to your standards or expectations. I don&#39;t mean praise people for doing bad jobs! that&#39;s belittling. My 9yo, for instance helps with groceries: she reminds us what to buy, helps pick it out, helps unpack and arrange the groceries. She helps feed the pets and water the plants. She reminds me to do laundry when she&#39;s low on clean socks and towels. All of those things are helpful, even if I could think of a hundred other ways she could do better. And so she helps with a happy heart, glad to give what she can to the family - that&#39;s way better than clean dishes and made beds ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"Kelly Lovejoy","from":"Kelly Lovejoy &lt;kbcdlovejo@...&gt;","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] curbing behavior","postDate":"1305911739","msgId":46732,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDREU1MjhBRDFCNDYxQy0xODMwLTYwNjJDQHdlYm1haWwtbTA4MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyNWhjbys0NTYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlyNWhjbys0NTYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46731,"nextInTopic":46733,"prevInTime":46731,"nextInTime":46733,"topicId":46720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes.

It&#39;s some mighty ingrained thinking that takes 40 years to  <br/>\nthrow off!<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling is about helping kids find (safe, respectful,  <br/>\nkind, etc.) ways to do what they&#39;re trying to do.

Kids are seen as lesser beings. Less deserving.  <br/>\nLess whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile kids aren&#39;t adults, they are people who respond to their needs  <br/>\nbeing treated with respect. Their needs are different. Their  <br/>\nunderstanding of the world is different. But their needs are no less  <br/>\nimportant to them than adult needs are to the adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s a thought: If kids need deep explanations of why they need  <br/>\nto do something, maybe it&#39;s not as needed as the parents think. So  <br/>\nmuch of parenting is done just because that&#39;s what everyone does. 3  <br/>\nmeals a day. Brush teeth twice a day. Don&#39;t wear the same clothes two  <br/>\ndays in a row. 3 hours of TV is too much. Put your toys away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those things are worthy of being questioned. If you&#39;re giving  <br/>\nadult reasons to kids -- who have a very different view of the world  <br/>\n-- it&#39;s likely they aren&#39;t going to get why those reasons are  <br/>\nimportant.

It will take some time and a kind of &quot;deschooling&quot; though as you and your child learn a new way of getting along. You&#39;ll be learning some new skills and they&#39;ll feel awkward and creaky at first, so go slowly.

Small steps. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I have tried incorporating a more gentle approach but when my 3.5 year old son is defiant its very frustrating.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to step back from the idea of &quot;defiant&quot;. Behavior is a kind of communication. If your son is saying &quot;No&quot; to you, that&#39;s something think about - what Else is he trying to tell you. Little children can find the world a veeeerrrry frustrating place - everything is too big, too hard, too complicated. Actively look for ways to make your child&#39;s life easier. That sounds strange, maybe, but a lot of that &quot;defiance&quot; is his way of telling you how frustrated he is with the big, overwhelming world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help, too, to see your own frustration in your child&#39;s defiance. Most adults find the world overwhelming from time to time ;) so be gentle with him. Many many unschooling parents report that by giving kids the kindness and consideration they didn&#39;t get, themselves, they get a chance to heal from their own childhood woes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;My short temper and frustration has rubbed off on my child <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to say modelling has no effects, but if he&#39;s biologically your child, he may have a naturally shorter fuse - and you may, too. It may be natural for you Both to frustrate easily. So be gentle with Both your feelings. That isn&#39;t to say its okay to haul off and throw temper tantrums at your child, but realize that you&#39;ll be learning better skills to help both of you. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning to be proactive - to think ahead and set your child up for success - is one of the most valuable things any parent can learn. It lessens your overall stress in a big way and that will help with a short fuse! So looking for ways to make your child&#39;s life easier is a good place to start. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;ve tried talking/asking nicely and I usually have to repeat myself until I&#39;m beyond irritated<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nStop repeating long before then and Do something.

It takes awhile to get the hang of this, as I said, and be able to think of other options. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] curbing behavior","postDate":"1305902453","msgId":46725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQyRkQ0Q0U1LUZBM0EtNDM4My04OTIwLTJGNTFERjRDMTIxRUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDdCMDczMThCLUUzMUQtNDMwQS04ODczLTI4OTEwNEQzNEI3QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGlyNWhjbys0NTYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8N0IwNzMxOEItRTMxRC00MzBBLTg4NzMtMjg5MTA0RDM0QjdCQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":46724,"nextInTopic":46726,"prevInTime":46724,"nextInTime":46726,"topicId":46720,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I meant to pass this along: THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove Every day, very short, very succinct points.

I am not even sure I will be able to relax from textbooks to get to unschooling, as I am a pretty uptight person.  I have a perfectionist personality with myself, so I feel I should get things done more efficiently, faster, etc.  So I find myself to be crabby with defiant kids--not that mine are at all times, but I think we all (even adults) have defiant moments.  I also feel so rushed, due to some circumstances with two of the kids being disabled, another being very involved in outside-of-the-home activities.  I have to say, too, that I find it frustrating with the people who allow their kids to continually expect deep explanations of why they have to do something.  I have never had an employer or anybody in authority let me do that...some things you just have to do.  I don&#39;t know how to get to the point of relaxing enough and knowing when to let the kids keep asking for explanations, or when to let them keep &quot;playing&quot; me to delay the inevitable that they have to get done.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, I don&#39;t mean to imply that all my kids constantly do this.  But I know that I have allowed them far more room to do this in the past, and am struggling, as you stated, to reverse this trend.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jessica&quot; &lt;nathansmommy1020@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi there.

Doing is better <br/>\nthan talking. Look for ways to help him to feel better. You are calling it <br/>\ndefiance, presumably something that he wants to do that you don&#39;t want him to <br/>\ndo. If you can, figure out ways to help him do what he wants to do. Figure out <br/>\nways to say yes more. If you can&#39;t say yes in that particular moment, look for <br/>\nother things that may entertain him right then and there, and try and come up <br/>\nwith ways to say yes to what he wanted later. So, for example, he wants to paint <br/>\non the walls and you don&#39;t want him to. Maybe you could help him paint on paper <br/>\nin the moment, or go outside and draw on chalk on the sidewalk or the side of <br/>\nthe house and then have fun washing it off with soapy water later. Maybe you <br/>\ncould even find some washable paints and paint the walls and wash them off <br/>\nlater. Or draw and paint on a wall that you were planning on redecorating <br/>\nanyhow. Or get paints for in the bath and use them in that moment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps when someone is 3.5 to feed them little things throughout the day. <br/>\nHunger is a big contributing factor to mood. Being hungry can make you pretty <br/>\ngrouchy. Eating can make you less so. Being sleepy can make you grouchy, look <br/>\nfor clues that your son is tired and respond with things like cuddling up to <br/>\nread or watch a movie or do something quiet and calming. Try not to overplan <br/>\ndays, try not to do a lot of things at a go. There was advice in Dr. Spocks book <br/>\non childcare that I still remember about walking with a young child to anywhere. <br/>\nDon&#39;t expect to get there with any kind of speed. Go with the expectation that <br/>\nthe journey will be longer than the errand could possibly take. Plan your days <br/>\non a slower schedule with a young child. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jessica &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nathansmommy1020@...\">nathansmommy1020@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 20 May, 2011 11:56:24<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] curbing behavior<br/>\n<br/>\nHi there.
