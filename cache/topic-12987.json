If not can you explain it more.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, the lightening the mood came about after reading &quot;How to <br/>\nTalk...&quot; and &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; I think. What I noticed was that in <br/>\nour playgroup, the punitive parents had skulky kids who still <br/>\nexhibited the SAME behaviors they were trying to get rid of. I <br/>\nthought, WHY be mean when it works NO better and makes everyone more <br/>\nstressed. Mostly, I think it is about age and time, learning <br/>\nactively how to be kind and gentle by example. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the how... Well, you are bigger aren&#39;t you? JK :)<br/>\nScoop her up in a loving way. Twirl her around. Tickle her if she <br/>\nenjoys it (mine used to ask) Turn it into a game and gently fold in <br/>\nthe &quot;rules&quot; of the game (letting her know that you understand she <br/>\nneeds attention, but could ask for it in a more helpful way). Look <br/>\nher in the eye and tell her you are on the same team. You WANT to <br/>\nhelp but aren&#39;t sure how. Get her doing something active. Perhaps <br/>\nsaying &quot;That&#39;s too rough around littler kids, do you want to go play <br/>\nchase with me?&quot; &quot;Hide and Seek?&quot; &quot;Kick a ball?&quot; &quot;Dance?&quot; She might <br/>\nneed to move MORE before she gets to that point. Hand her some dough <br/>\nto mold. Help her play with something where hitting or throwing are <br/>\ntotally appropriate...drums, soft sock throwing, etc. Redirect. If <br/>\nshe is stressed around the other kids, cuddle her as you move out of <br/>\neye sight of the others and help her. Every kid is different. I <br/>\nagree though, that staying close and helping her feel good before <br/>\nthese behaviors crop up is the best thing to do. Does she have <br/>\nwarning signs? Can you help her be aware of them so she can back off <br/>\non her own?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, fill her cup emotionally before you go, if you are still going <br/>\nto.

Nobody should ever use ANY kind of force on her OTHER  <br/>\nthan to stop her from hitting or otherwise hurting someone else or  <br/>\nendangering herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet that if you simply stop going out so much, don&#39;t have other  <br/>\nkids over, and your husband doesn&#39;t &quot;handle&quot; her - constrain her,  <br/>\nmake her do things, etc., that she&#39;ll stop hitting within 6 months to  <br/>\na year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in the meantime, I bet you need to read &quot;The Hurried Child,&quot; by  <br/>\nDavid Elkind, because I think you&#39;re expecting too much of her  <br/>\n(meaning you think that she&#39;s more &#39;advanced&#39; in her thinking and  <br/>\nemotions than she really is - probably because you&#39;re overly  <br/>\nimpressed with her verbal abilities) and that pattern will probably  <br/>\ncontinue as she gets older and you&#39;ll continue to stress her out.  <br/>\nMaybe if you read, &quot;The Hurried Child,&quot;it&#39;ll head off worse stress in  <br/>\nthe future, for her (and you).<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 918- dd is a hitter","postDate":"1147415555","msgId":12989,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMzMzkxNDRFLTEyMDAtNDRBQS1BMEUwLTUwOEE2RkQxODVFQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNTEyMDEwNi4xZkVwUU0xdVYzTmwzNGQxQG14LXBpbmNob3QuYXRsLnNhLmVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwNTEyMDEwNi4xZkVwUU0xdVYzTmwzNGQxQG14LXBpbmNob3QuYXRsLnNhLmVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":12987,"nextInTopic":12990,"prevInTime":12988,"nextInTime":12990,"topicId":12987,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Thank you for the book recommendations, dh is  <br/>\n&gt; starting<br/>\n&gt; &quot;How to Talk...&quot; hopefully we&#39;ll find some good tips.  I&#39;m also  <br/>\n&gt; looking into<br/>\n&gt; the other books mentioned.  I spoke about that this with my local<br/>\n&gt; unschooling group at our park day yesterday.  One mother actually  <br/>\n&gt; admitted<br/>\n&gt; having a hitter, and said just to keep telling her that it&#39;s not  <br/>\n&gt; ok, and be<br/>\n&gt; patient, that is very hard when it&#39;s already been more than a year,  <br/>\n&gt; and this<br/>\n&gt; happens, on bad weeks, nearly everyday.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My concerns about her hitting other children have more to do with the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;bullying&quot; she seems to sometimes do and the fact that she  <br/>\n&gt; continues to hurt<br/>\n&gt; children after they have said stop or are crying.  That&#39;s why I  <br/>\n&gt; feel like<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s malice.  Here&#39;s an example.  I sometimes teach sign language  <br/>\n&gt; classes<br/>\n&gt; out of my home to mothers with babies and toddlers.  Before this  <br/>\n&gt; incident<br/>\n&gt; Rachel just played during the classes, nursed, whatever she  <br/>\n&gt; needed.  I might<br/>\n&gt; add this happened last August, dd was about 20 months at the time.   <br/>\n&gt; Anyway<br/>\n&gt; during class she singled out one particular baby who was about 9  <br/>\n&gt; months old<br/>\n&gt; and kept acting a little aggressive towards him, hovering over him,  <br/>\n&gt; taking<br/>\n&gt; things from him.  Then a little later she threw a plastic bottle at  <br/>\n&gt; him and<br/>\n&gt; hit him in the head.  I of course told her we don&#39;t throw things at  <br/>\n&gt; people<br/>\n&gt; and explained how it had hurt him and how fragile babies are.  She  <br/>\n&gt; nursed<br/>\n&gt; and the mother walked up and down the foyer trying to comfort her  <br/>\n&gt; baby.<br/>\n&gt; After she nursed she got up found the bottle went over to the foyer  <br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; tried again to throw it at the baby.  This is the kind of behavior I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; talking about.  Some might call it testing, it just seems spiteful  <br/>\n&gt; to me.<br/>\n&gt; The baby didn&#39;t have her toys or anything.  I have no idea why he was<br/>\n&gt; singled out, he wasn&#39;t the only baby that age there.  Anyway, the  <br/>\n&gt; incidents<br/>\n&gt; betwn her and playmates have lessened and only seem to occur every few<br/>\n&gt; weeks.  My main concern is that she hits her daddy nearly everyday,<br/>\n&gt; especially if she&#39;s having a bad week.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;     From: &quot;Melissa&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:autismhelp@...\">autismhelp@...</a><br/>\n&gt;     Date: Tue May 9, 2006 2:16pm(PDT)<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Help- dd is a hitter<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; quick question...if she doesn&#39;t have friends or prefer to be with<br/>\n&gt;&gt; friends, then who are these kids at the playgroup?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Clarification-  She does have friends that she enjoys playing with  <br/>\n&gt; when we<br/>\n&gt; get together, she just doesn&#39;t ever ask for anyone, the way it  <br/>\n&gt; seems most<br/>\n&gt; her friends do.

This is the same friend she slapped BTW.<br/>\nIt just depends on her mood and the week/day.  <br/>\nIf I were to drop playgroups, I think I&#39;d go crazy. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;It could still be a communication thing. It&#39;s not just<br/>\n&gt;about knowing language. It involves knowing yourself<br/>\n&gt;well enough to know what&#39;s bugging you and then<br/>\n&gt;finding the words to describe that. I have trouble<br/>\n&gt;with that at the ripe old age of 41.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point thanks for the insite.<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    From: &quot;marji&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marji@...\">marji@...</a><br/>\n    Date: Tue May 9, 2006 3:16pm(PDT) <br/>\n&gt;I think it would probably be very helpful for you to be very involved <br/>\n&gt;or at least be very close by whenever she is with other kids.  That <br/>\n&gt;way, you can see potential triggers and head them off with <br/>\n&gt;distraction and other things before she gets to hitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do try and do this it&#39;s just not always easy to do before she hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Also, ask yourself is she could be hungry or have low blood sugar <br/>\n&gt;when these things happen.  Sometimes a healthy snack is all a kid <br/>\n&gt;needs to feel right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also try to take this into consideration, but even if one of those is the<br/>\nculprit I feel she needs to learn that it&#39;s never okay to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    From: &quot;Kiersten Pasciak&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kjl8@...\">kjl8@...</a><br/>\n    Date: Tue May 9, 2006 3:27pm(PDT) <br/>\nSubject: Re: Help- dd is a hitter-LONG<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;a &quot;secret&quot; signal that lightens things up- I used to tickle Jacob&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure how to go about explaining/initiating this is it from the &quot;How<br/>\nto Talk&quot; book?  If not can you explain it more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I have recently read another book which has given me more<br/>\n&gt;perspective and more specific tools for my OWN behavior. It is<br/>\n&gt;written with the idea that we can&#39;t teach that which we do not know.<br/>\n&gt;It is called &quot;Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline&quot; by Becky Bailey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I definitely need to look into reading this one.  I know I have some<br/>\nof my own anger management issues, passed down from my mom.  Thanks for all<br/>\nthe info.<br/>\n<br/>\n    From: &quot;Kiersten Pasciak&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kjl8@...\">kjl8@...</a><br/>\n    Date: Tue May 9, 2006 4:43pm(PDT) <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;When a child is sent to the Comfort Corner the only rule is that you <br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t talk about why they were sent when they are there, and they <br/>\n&gt;may come out when they are ready to rejoin the family and be <br/>\n&gt;cooperative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started using TO&#39;s they were supposed to be a calming time for<br/>\nher, then it happened that it just kind of became punitive.  What do you do<br/>\nwhen they need time in a comfort chair but don&#39;t want to go?  How do you get<br/>\nstarted with it, and can I start at this age?  Was this information from a<br/>\nbook?  How do I keep from making it become negative?<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;For older children there may be a need for a tool called &quot;you hit, <br/>\n&gt;you sit&quot;.  When children get aggressive and violent it&#39;s appropriate <br/>\n&gt;to stop their bodies and give them a chance to get their brain back <br/>\n&gt;in control.  If you have a Comfort Corner they can be sent there, or <br/>\n&gt;even just sitting on the couch until they are ready to be calm in <br/>\n&gt;their play and make amends. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how this is different from a TO, it&#39;s just called a cool down,<br/>\nagain it makes me ask the same questions as above... what if they don&#39;t want<br/>\nto cool down...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Mostly, GBD is about working to proactively prevent the situations <br/>\n&gt;that would result in time outs.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m just tired, but what does GBD stand for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    From: &quot;clinstrom5&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:clinstrom5@...\">clinstrom5@...</a><br/>\n    Date: Tue May 9, 2006 6:05pm(PDT) <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;Anyway, this probably won&#39;t be the total answer but maybe another <br/>\n&gt;tool to help.  When my toddlers were violent for whatever reason to <br/>\n&gt;another child I always comforted and paid A LOT of attention to that <br/>\n&gt;other child very obviously in front of my toddler.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually tried this a few times, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  I even tried<br/>\nfrom Dr. Sears, when dd hits daddy, telling her that I don&#39;t like it when<br/>\nshe hits the man I love and not playing with her. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12993,"nextTopicId":13034}}
