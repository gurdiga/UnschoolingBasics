We&#39;ve just BTDT and want to<br/>\ngive folks the heads-up about the damage it can cause even when it all<br/>\nseems innocent enough. My oldest went to pre-k and kindergarten, he<br/>\nstill remembers a lot of unhappy things from Kindergarten!!<br/>\nUnbelievable to me, because my K year was very pleasant and happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a foster child in preschool for the summer because his social worker <br/>\nthinks it is important for him to be in an &quot;educational program&quot; and wrote it <br/>\ninto his service plan.  My dealings with the women who run the preschool <br/>\n(daycare) have been extremely unpleasant.  They make all the children ages 2-5 eat <br/>\ntheir meal ( i.e. sandwich or chicken nuggets) before they can have access to <br/>\nthe rest of their lunch/snacks. My guy translates this into--we have to sneak <br/>\nour grapes and cookies if we want them. They force all the kids to lay down at <br/>\n1:00 for rest time.  My foster kid is on Adderall (amphetamines) so rest is <br/>\nnot an option for him.  They refuse to allow him to look at a book until he has <br/>\nbeen calm and quiet for 10-15 minutes which results in daily power struggles.  <br/>\nHe sneaks cars and little toys under his blanket so he won&#39;t go crazy trying <br/>\nto lay still until he can get the book. I asked them why they won&#39;t just let <br/>\nhim have a book if the goal is to have everyone be quiet and rest for that hour <br/>\nand the book helps this little guy stay calm.  I asked why a 2 year old that <br/>\nwe love was in time out for a period in excess of 15 minutes and they said <br/>\nbecause she hit another two year old. That&#39;s a positive teaching method for a <br/>\ntoddler. I love the sobbing baby in time out method.  So sweet to witness. I <br/>\nasked them about each of these concerns and many more and I have learned that they <br/>\nare a bunch of codependent control freaks who are so narrow minded at this <br/>\npoint that they are not open to any reasonable discussion.  I see very little <br/>\nkindness or compassion or fun at this place although my foster son loves going.  <br/>\nHe is used to constant control and cruelty so it is familiar and comfortable <br/>\nto him.  Scary!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice for anyone who has a child in daycare/preschool is to stop by at <br/>\ndifferent times and check on things.  I have walked into extreme ugliness and <br/>\ncruelty several times and have yet to walk into a room of happy kids or staff.  <br/>\nThe daycare I&#39;m sending this boy to is also accredited which is supposed to <br/>\ncarry some prestige.  Since my guy started going there, they have hung sleigh <br/>\nbells on the outside door and they have covered the window into the classroom <br/>\nwith the children&#39;s art.  No doubt, just for me, the daycare stalker.  Every <br/>\ninch of the window is covered so one cannot even peek inside.  I continue to drop <br/>\nhim off late and pick him up early and stop in to bring him something he may <br/>\nneed, just to see what&#39;s going on.  I&#39;ve only had to rescue him once when he <br/>\nhad wet his pants and they were ostracizing him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDaycare is not a normal or healthy environment for any child in my opinion.  <br/>\nMy guy will be finished there next week, never to return again.  He starts <br/>\npublic kindergarten in an accredited kindergarten program in September.  They <br/>\nforbid cursive writing at this K-2 school.  Such joy!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin in MA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16294,"nextTopicId":16366}}
