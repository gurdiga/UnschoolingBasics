Is that hypocritical or am I just being realistic?!  lol&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nLOLOL  Yeah, both :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThe cool thing, if you maintain communication with your kid, is that  they&#39;ll <br/>\nTELL you what&#39;s happening in their lives. My 17 year old son&#39;s father  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t believe that, but it&#39;s true. <br/>\n <br/>\nMany of us parents of teens have had conversations that yes, it IS hard,  but <br/>\nthen we get so amazed with the maturity and honesty of our kids. <br/>\n <br/>\nJulian&#39;s unschooled girlfriend, Jessica, 14, is here for the summer from  <br/>\nArkansas. We&#39;re in Massachusetts. There is so much trust involved here:  <br/>\nJessica&#39;s parents are trusting her away from them for a couple of months, with  her <br/>\nboyfriend, far from home. They are trusting us to take good care of her. All  <br/>\nthe parents trust both these kids to make good decisions, and the  kids trust us <br/>\nto talk to us. <br/>\n <br/>\nThey are lovely together. They are kind and respectful and silly and fun.  <br/>\nNeither is EVER jealous of the other -- they trust each other with their hearts. <br/>\n They are young, so it&#39;s impossible to say that this is a permanent <br/>\nrelationship  (can you ever?), but it&#39;s very clear that both of them have remarkable  <br/>\nintelligence about relationships. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a very cool thing to watch.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25253,"nextTopicId":25368}}
