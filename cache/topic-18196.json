Last year we left MS , left a $45,000 job ( which amazingly we were just barely getting the bills paid) a house full of furniture , etc and became &quot;homeless&quot; . We also left a community, school etc that was not right for my children. Too long to write it all out right now but just ugh a lot of corruption. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  We lived off savings for about 3 months and well since we didnt have much savings had to hury up and find something. We are living off $600 twice a month ....moneywise things are tighter than they have ever been before but its Wonderful!. ...I feel weird praising a school on an unschooling list but hey its part of our life right now.........<br/>\n  Nates new school has done more for him in 8 weeks than the old school did in 2 years. In the old school Id come to pick him up and he would be just laying on the floor in a corner kicking the wall. ( and they wonder why he has absent over 50% of the time ) here they take him for rides in the wagon , rock him etc to give him frequent breaks that he needs, massage his feet, give him lots of sensory play...anything that they can do to help him feel comfortable in what is a very uncomfortable world. <br/>\n  We left a community in MS that had a eww whats wrong with him atttitude and ended up in a community that embraces him as he is . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Anyhow Im sorry my rambling is getting really long so Ill hurry up and end this thing. I used to think well if we just start having a bit more money and get ..X life will be so much better..........life is better now. Sure we have our trials ...Im worrying about how &quot;santa&quot; is going to make it here this year.......we no longer have high speed net , or a netflix subscription, or satelite, or ..........................but we have friends and trees and butterflies and a family that is happier than ever before. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n All-new Yahoo!
