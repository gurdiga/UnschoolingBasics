In her book she references John Holt and John Taylor Gatto. I<br/>\n read the quotes from both of these men to my husband. I was drawn to<br/>\n Holt, so I read How Children Learn. My husband was interested in<br/>\n reading Gatto so he read Dumbing Us Down, A Different Kind Of Teacher<br/>\n and The Underground History of American Education. Since I&#39;ve never<br/>\n read Gatto I hoping some here have and can give me some answers. My<br/>\n husband LOVED Gatto&#39;s books. From what I understand John Gatto (by<br/>\n what my dh and others who have read him say) isn&#39;t so much a<br/>\n proponent of US as much as he has a despise for public school,<br/>\n therefore given more creditability to home schooling or unschooling.<br/>\n So whenever I try to bring up the valid points about television with<br/>\n my dh he shuts off. He counters that he can&#39;t understand how an US<br/>\n group can be so okay with TV. If an US group really values what Gatto<br/>\n has to say then they couldn&#39;t possibly support television because he<br/>\n is so against it. In fact it was after he read Gatto&#39;s books that we<br/>\n moved our TV downstairs and then finally sold it for good. I&#39;m not<br/>\n sad we sold the TV, I never had time to watch it anyway. But I&#39;m<br/>\n curious did my dh misunderstand where John Gatto stood on the issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGatto&#39;s books appeal to men a LOT. But Gatto&#39;s experience is with <br/>\nschooled children ONLY.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He has no experience with mindfully parented, unschooled children. So <br/>\nhe has a difference point of view altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Also, he&#39;s my dad&#39;s age. That generation has a really hard time with <br/>\nTV. Books are the be-all-end-all for that generation. Radio was <br/>\nconsidered avant-garde! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really important to look at where he&#39;s coming from. Not the same <br/>\nplace that we are, for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nI value a lot of what he has to say, but he has no experience with <br/>\nunschooling---so understand that he has his limits.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you might want to suggest that your husband NOT shut off from <br/>\nlearning. That&#39;s a *very* schoolish mentality. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

It&#39;s more accurate  <br/>\nto say that our ideas on school overlap.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t even based on John Holt. He just observed  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s natural ability to learn and wrote about it. At first he  <br/>\nnoticed natural learning in the context of school hoping to use that  <br/>\nto make schools better places to learn. But the more he observed, the  <br/>\nmore he realized that school interfered with our natural abilities  <br/>\nand prevented kids from learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is based on human&#39;s natural ability to learn. John Holt  <br/>\nsaid a lot of things about it that have withstood the test of time.  <br/>\nWhich makes him brilliant :-) But we don&#39;t unschool based on what he  <br/>\nsaid but based on what happens with real kids who are given the  <br/>\nfreedom and support to learn from living life.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers have been carrying on with Holt&#39;s observations. I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink John Holt much liked TV either. I&#39;ve read a quote about it but  <br/>\nI can&#39;t remember what it was. Perhaps TV (back in the 60s) felt more  <br/>\nakin to school -- watching and listening like in school rather than  <br/>\ndoing -- than living life. (That&#39;s just a guess from a vague memory.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;ve had collective years more experience with natural learning  <br/>\nthan John Holt. It&#39;s not that we&#39;ve blindly said TV is good. It&#39;s  <br/>\nthat we&#39;ve seen how TV incorporates into a full unschooling life and  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t have the effects that people who fear it say it will. We  <br/>\nspeak from experience and critical examination, not uncritical  <br/>\nconviction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;d like to list Gatto&#39;s objections, we can tell him what really  <br/>\nhappens when TV is part of kids&#39; freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23654,"nextTopicId":23837}}
