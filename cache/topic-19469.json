I just can&#39;t deal with it given all the other stuff I&#39;m<br/>\nthinking about at that time, so I think it wears on me quicker and<br/>\nharder. But tonight, being alone with him, it was very different. he<br/>\nwas still the same with his needs - more so because it was SO crowded,<br/>\nbut I had no problem giving him the extras he needed. I was calm and<br/>\nrelaxed, not having all the extra thoughts of errands, kids, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I came away from tonight with better insight, both on him and me.

He likes to be attached as well. <br/>\nHis coping mechanism is stroking MY face, right around my lips, over <br/>\nand over again. I am not a huge fan of being touched, especially in <br/>\nthis very sensitive area of my face. DS&#39;s touch can be very <br/>\naggressive, he seems to have trouble preceiving the level of his <br/>\ntouch, so he needs guidance with the level of touch as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he is really struggling he can require what seems likes hours of <br/>\ntouch. I felt obligated to meet his needs, but it was breeding <br/>\nresentment in me, which in turn, caused ds more stress. Even when I <br/>\nfelt like i was meeting his needs, he did not seem content.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I talked to ds&#39;s occupational therapist. I have and am struggling <br/>\nwith addressing ds&#39;s needs, professional assistance, and my parenting <br/>\nbeliefs. I am fortunate that most of ds&#39;s therapists are pretty <br/>\nrespectful folks, and I currently believe that their assistance is <br/>\nhelpful, pleasant for ds, and legally necessary (I am going through a <br/>\ncustody battle as well). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she suggusted meeting the need for some amount of time, no <br/>\ndiscussion. Then at some point, say ten minutes or so, telling him <br/>\nthat I needed a break, discussing options, and helping him to engage <br/>\nin another activity. If he is insistant that he must continue, then <br/>\nto set a timelimit for another round, do so willingly, then when the <br/>\ntime is up, say &quot;ok time to xyz,and moving on to an engaging activity <br/>\n(one that can meet the need that he seems to need - like jumping on <br/>\nthe trampoline, or a deep massage, or putting pillows on him and <br/>\nlaying on him). <br/>\n<br/>\nI thought she was crazy as she went through this with me - ds is very <br/>\npaasionate to say the least and I felt pretty confidant that he would <br/>\nend up exploding if I said no, but I realized that it was about not <br/>\nsaying no, but finding more mutually acceptable ways to cope. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it has worked. Since I know that it is not going to go on <br/>\nforever, and I look at it as a learning experience about my child. My <br/>\nchild (I hope)knows that I am going to meet his needs. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning more about his limits and triggers and not taking him <br/>\nto his edge, equiping him with the ability to voice his feelings and <br/>\nneeds, and actively problem solving with him to meet those needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been pleasantly surprised by his ability to tell me what he <br/>\nneeds lately. Sometimes it is very raw, but he is now able to reach <br/>\nout to me in the heat of his passion and ask for help -a huge his <br/>\nstep for him. He is also able to hear me and see that I am trying to <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to try the weighted vests, but I have experimented with <br/>\ndifferent textures and objects for ds to touch. Any substitutions <br/>\nwould just send him over the edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck. My ds also has an articulation disorder, a receptive <br/>\nlanguage disorder, pragmatic language disorder, and auditory <br/>\nprocessing disorder, so language  can be a real challenge for us.<br/>\nHe is also considered to be globally developmentally delayed, with <br/>\nplanning difficulties, muscular incoridination and weakness, and <br/>\nvisual/spatial difficulties.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I am sure you know, this must make life so challenging for him. I <br/>\nfind it very challenging, especially as a single parent, but it <br/>\nreally does help to try and look at things from his point of view. I <br/>\nfind myself evualating new situations, looking for triggers, and then <br/>\ntrying to help ds navigate, with out &quot;crowding&quot; him, per se.<br/>\n<br/>\nKepp your chin up, it sounds like ds is fortunate to have a dm who <br/>\ncares so much.<br/>\n<br/>\n --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;alisonslp&quot; <br/>\n&lt;alisonslp@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; I really want to get a handle on this but I don&#39;t know how.
