I am deaf in my right<br/>\near and partially deaf in my left and my hearing aid is not only<br/>\nuncomfortable but also does not help with the distortion that I have<br/>\nin my hearing.   My son is only 3 years old, but he has already<br/>\nlearned that when he wants me to hear him, he gets right up to my<br/>\nface, puts his hand under my chin and turns my head toward him.  My<br/>\nhusband has a loud booming voice and I am doing pretty well with my 3<br/>\nyear-old so far, though he is happy to resort to his baby sign when<br/>\nnecessary which has been helpful for context.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father had a low west-Texan drawl that was very difficult for me to<br/>\nhear much less understand and he used to chalk up my inability to make<br/>\nout what he was saying to my not paying attention.  Very frustrating<br/>\non both our parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to second the previous poster on the reflective hearing.<br/>\n My husband and I have been together 8 years, under the same roof for<br/>\n5, and he will still try to speak to me from another room.  I &quot;know&quot;<br/>\nhe is talking but have no idea what he is saying except for a word<br/>\nhear and there.  I used to give him the talk on how he &quot;of ALL people&quot;<br/>\nshould be understanding and tolerant of my hearing issues and not try<br/>\nto talk to me from another room.  Now I just take a moment to try and<br/>\nguess what I thought he said and I will repeat it back to him even if<br/>\nit makes absolutely no sense. This frequently leads to us laughing<br/>\nuproariously together since I am so far off the mark of what he was<br/>\ntrying to say.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also found over time that he is starting to get a sense of just<br/>\nhow messed up my hearing is (I used to try once or twice to hear and<br/>\nif I can&#39;t get it by that time, I would just smile and nod my head and<br/>\npretend to understand...when it suited his purpose he would take this<br/>\nas me FINALLY getting it, so he wasn&#39;t aware of just how much I was<br/>\nmissing.)   This greater understanding has led him to make further<br/>\nefforts to work with my hearing issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience the hearing people of the planet, while they are<br/>\nwell-meaning, really don&#39;t get the hearing challenges for those of us<br/>\nwith distortion issues.  Everyone thinks that amplification is the<br/>\nsolution.  Even the various audiologists I have gone to for hearing<br/>\naid help, though very well-meaning, just don&#39;t get what life is like<br/>\nfrom my end because they have never been hard of hearing and hearing<br/>\naids are a very flawed semi-solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do teach at university and my method with my students is if I can&#39;t<br/>\nget it on the second try I have them either spell it for me or right<br/>\nit on the white board in the room (I teach small classes, max 20<br/>\nstudents, so writing on the board is quick and easy for most<br/>\nstudents.) This has been very effective and within a few classes my<br/>\nstudents will already be moving towards the board when I am obviously<br/>\nnot getting the first comment.  I teach a lot about learning styles,<br/>\nso it just reinforces how to get info across to visual learners (of<br/>\nwhich I am an EXTREME example) so the whole process actually segues<br/>\nwith the point of my class.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this long post was to further support the recommendations to use<br/>\nreflective listening, special signs, have your son spell things out<br/>\n(to his ability level) and maybe even consider getting one of those<br/>\nsmall whiteboards to keep in high communication areas (kitchen, car,<br/>\netc as a mobile visual aid).

I understand there are similar<br/>\nsystems that can be installed in classrooms or homes that would have<br/>\nmicrophones in various places so that the person having difficulty<br/>\nwould be able to hear conversation more clearly .. it basically turns<br/>\ndown the world and turns up the important sounds like your family<br/>\nmember who is speaking.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea you could use is to come up with your own system of sign<br/>\nlanguage where he could indicate in the beginning that something is<br/>\nvery important for you to hear versus something that he just wants to<br/>\nshare but isn&#39;t an emergency ... that way he doesn&#39;t get frustrated<br/>\nwhen you can&#39;t hear and you don&#39;t panic when you are trying to figure<br/>\nout whether he said  &quot; the house is on fire&quot;  versus &quot; a mouse on a<br/>\nhighwire&quot;.    If he indicated that something was crucial for you to<br/>\nhear or important to him for you to hear then you could both take a<br/>\nsecond to adjust your positions and carefully share the information.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI frequently have ask my daughter to repeat something because she<br/>\ntends to get lower as she speaks .. I hear the first 4 words then she<br/>\nsputters out ... I ask for her to repeat or try to clarify and because<br/>\nof her difficulties it&#39;s hard for her to just give the missing<br/>\ninformation and she will start over at the beginning which yeah you<br/>\nguessed it means she runs out of steam at the exact some place!!!  <br/>\nShe gets frustrated and I get frustrated ... I try to say to her ..<br/>\nit&#39;s not you it&#39;s mom ... I didn&#39;t hear what you said so would you<br/>\nmind telling me again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope something here helps!!<br/>\nLisa B</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287391473,"authorName":"hamsder clan","from":"&quot;hamsder clan&quot; &lt;hamsder@...&gt;","profile":"hamsder","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:Respecting the mumbler","postDate":"1215458156","msgId":34400,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxYTgyMmMzMDgwNzA3MTIxNWw2NGE0YzE2bDg1NzgxYTM3ODBkYWY3ZjdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY3YTlkNzUwMDgwNzA3MTE1NWsxNGRkNWViM3lkNzhmMTczZjE1NzRjY2E4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwNjcwMWM4ZTA2MSQwNmRkZDUzMCQzMzAxYThjMEBsZXNsZXlwYz4JIDw2N2E5ZDc1MDA4MDcwNzExNTVrMTRkZDVlYjN5ZDc4ZjE3M2YxNTc0Y2NhOEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":34399,"nextInTopic":34452,"prevInTime":34399,"nextInTime":34401,"topicId":34366,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"how is liam with writing? maybe you could get a portable size white board to have on hand in places like the car where you can t change your position to remedy","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1662203844\">how is liam with writing? maybe you could get a portable size white<br/>\nboard to have on hand in places like the car where you can&#39;t change<br/>\nyour position to remedy the situation. you might be able to make a<br/>\ngame out of expressing as mush as possible in as few words as<br/>\npossible. heck, you could both learn shorthand!<br/>\n<br/>\ngood luck... it sounds like a frustrating situation for both of you.<br/>\n<br/>\njenny (larkin 3.5, finn 1.5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Jul 7, 2008 at 11:55 AM, Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; I do hope that it came across that I know it&#39;s my problem (the hearing<br/>\n&gt; issue) and that I own that completely.

He may have a bit of built up frustration from the<br/>\npast yelling, which despite your attempts to handle things calmly and<br/>\nexplain your difficulty hearing and understanding,  may just take some time<br/>\nto wear off.

I have an auditory processing deficiet. (So<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I *hear* just fine, but my Lupus has destroyed, partially, the part of my<br/>\n&gt; &gt; brain that turns what I hear into sounds my brain can recognize.) People<br/>\n&gt; &gt; very often sound like Charlie Brown&#39;s teacher to me. To compensate for<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I read lips. I do this very well and don&#39;t often miss words. BUT with<br/>\n&gt; &gt; someone who mumbles, and therefore doesn&#39;t move his lips much, it&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; &gt; difficult. This &quot;problem&quot; with Liam has always been there. In the past<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve yelled about it. I&#39;ve had discussions with him about it. I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; &gt; lectured. I&#39;ve begged. I&#39;ve pleaded. I&#39;ve done all those things. He<br/>\n&gt; &gt; simply will not look at my face and move his lips or speak up. I know he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; *can* do this because he screams at his brother when they fight so it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; &gt; possible. It&#39;s not always (although I admit sometimes it has been)<br/>\n&gt; because<br/>\n&gt; &gt; he&#39;s in trouble or afraid of getting in trouble. It just seems to be his<br/>\n&gt; &gt; natural way of speaking. Which is fine. BUT since we have been doing this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; RU thing, I&#39;ve tried not to &quot;force&quot; him to speak so I can hear. But if I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ask him to repeat himself (he often remumbles or turns his head away from<br/>\n&gt; &gt; me) and then I have to ask him to repeat himself multiple times....he<br/>\n&gt; gets<br/>\n&gt; &gt; angry or upset because his needs aren&#39;t being met. This isn&#39;t a 100% of<br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time problem. But it&#39;s more than 50% of the time. What I can&#39;t figure out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is the respectful way to handle this. My needs and his needs don&#39;t seem<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; mesh here. Here&#39;s an example:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Liam wanted to tell me about something in the living room. I&#39;m on his<br/>\n&gt; left. The item is on his right. He says something about it and turns his<br/>\n&gt; head to face the object he want to tell me about. I say &quot;Liam, please look<br/>\n&gt; at my face and speak up, I can not hear you and I need to read your lips.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; He turns to me and starts again. &quot;Mom, did you see...&quot; and turns his head<br/>\n&gt; back to the object and again I can not hear him. &quot;Liam, you turned your<br/>\n&gt; head again, can you please turn your head back to me to finish talking? I<br/>\n&gt; missed the last part.&quot; And so it went, me picking up a word or two that was<br/>\n&gt; new and him turning his head. After the third time he&#39;s mad and says<br/>\n&gt; &quot;NEVERMIND!&quot; and storms off. Now in this specific example I could have<br/>\n&gt; gone to his side or moved in front of him but that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n&gt; Like when I&#39;m driving and he&#39;s sitting behind me. Constant low noise makes<br/>\n&gt; my problem even worse, like road noise, and I can&#39;t turn that off nor can I<br/>\n&gt; turn around to try to read his lips. When we are in the truck I tell him to<br/>\n&gt; scream at the back of my head so I can hear but he won&#39;t. He just gets<br/>\n&gt; mad. If John (my 12 yr old) is with me, I ask him to act as an intermediary<br/>\n&gt; so I can address Liam&#39;s concerns. But that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I want Liam to be heard, literally, but physically I can not do this. A<br/>\n&gt; hearing aid will not help me as it will just amplify the background noise.<br/>\n&gt; (I&#39;ve already asked about one.) I&#39;m sure there is a way to deal with this<br/>\n&gt; but I&#39;ll be darned if I can see a way to do it. There is probably something<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m doing wrong but I&#39;m REALLY trying to get Liam especially (he&#39;s a quiet<br/>\n&gt; and senstive child) to the point that he feels like he&#39;s always being<br/>\n&gt; heard. (Yes, I&#39;m trying to undo my traditional parenting still.) But no<br/>\n&gt; matter how I try to get it to happen, he seems to get upset about being<br/>\n&gt; &quot;called&quot; on the mumbling but really it&#39;s not something I&#39;m doing to shame<br/>\n&gt; him or make him feel bad. I simply can not hear him. I have talked to him<br/>\n&gt; about this when it&#39;s quiet, and we are alone, and he tells me he doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know why he mumbles, and has no ideas about how I could help him speak up<br/>\n&gt; when he needs something. So I&#39;ve tried to address it with him.

(So<br/>\n&gt; I *hear* just fine, but my Lupus has destroyed, partially, the part of my<br/>\n&gt; brain that turns what I hear into sounds my brain can recognize.)  People<br/>\n&gt; very often sound like Charlie Brown&#39;s teacher to me.  To compensate for this<br/>\n&gt; I read lips.  I do this very well and don&#39;t often miss words.  BUT with<br/>\n&gt; someone who mumbles, and therefore doesn&#39;t move his lips much, it&#39;s very<br/>\n&gt; difficult.  This &quot;problem&quot; with Liam has always been there.  In the past<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve yelled about it.  I&#39;ve had discussions with him about it.  I&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; lectured.  I&#39;ve begged.  I&#39;ve pleaded.  I&#39;ve done all those things.  He<br/>\n&gt; simply will not look at my face and move his lips or speak up.  I know he<br/>\n&gt; *can* do this because he screams at his brother when they fight so it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; possible.  It&#39;s not always (although I admit sometimes it has been) because<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s in trouble or afraid of getting in trouble.  It just seems to be his<br/>\n&gt; natural way of speaking.  Which is fine.  BUT since we have been doing this<br/>\n&gt; RU thing, I&#39;ve tried not to &quot;force&quot; him to speak so I can hear.  But if I<br/>\n&gt; ask him to repeat himself (he often remumbles or turns his head away from<br/>\n&gt; me) and then I have to ask him to repeat himself multiple times....he gets<br/>\n&gt; angry or upset because his needs aren&#39;t being met.  This isn&#39;t a 100% of the<br/>\n&gt; time problem.  But it&#39;s more than 50% of the time.  What I can&#39;t figure out<br/>\n&gt; is the respectful way to handle this.  My needs and his needs don&#39;t seem to<br/>\n&gt; mesh here.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Liam wanted to tell me about something in the living room.  I&#39;m on his<br/>\nleft.  The item is on his right.  He says something about it and turns his<br/>\nhead to face the object he want to tell me about.  I say &quot;Liam, please look<br/>\nat my face and speak up, I can not hear you and I need to read your lips.&quot;<br/>\nHe turns to me and starts again.  &quot;Mom, did you see...&quot; and turns his head<br/>\nback to the object and again I can not hear him.  &quot;Liam, you turned your<br/>\nhead again, can you please turn your head back to me to finish talking?  I<br/>\nmissed the last part.&quot;  And so it went, me picking up a word or two that was<br/>\nnew and him turning his head.  After the third time he&#39;s mad and says<br/>\n&quot;NEVERMIND!&quot;  and storms off.  Now in this specific example I could have<br/>\ngone to his side or moved in front of him but that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\nLike when I&#39;m driving and he&#39;s sitting behind me.  Constant low noise makes<br/>\nmy problem even worse, like road noise, and I can&#39;t turn that off nor can I<br/>\nturn around to try to read his lips.  When we are in the truck I tell him to<br/>\nscream at the back of my head so I can hear but he won&#39;t.  He just gets<br/>\nmad.  If John (my 12 yr old) is with me, I ask him to act as an intermediary<br/>\nso I can address Liam&#39;s concerns.  But that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I want Liam to be heard, literally, but physically I can not do this.  A<br/>\nhearing aid will not help me as it will just amplify the background noise.<br/>\n(I&#39;ve already asked about one.)  I&#39;m sure there is a way to deal with this<br/>\nbut I&#39;ll be darned if I can see a way to do it.  There is probably something<br/>\nI&#39;m doing wrong but I&#39;m REALLY trying to get Liam especially (he&#39;s a quiet<br/>\nand senstive child) to the point that he feels like he&#39;s always being<br/>\nheard.  (Yes, I&#39;m trying to undo my traditional parenting still.)  But no<br/>\nmatter how I try to get it to happen, he seems to get upset about being<br/>\n&quot;called&quot; on the mumbling but really it&#39;s not something I&#39;m doing to shame<br/>\nhim or make him feel bad.  I simply can not hear him.  I have talked to him<br/>\nabout this when it&#39;s quiet, and we are alone, and he tells me he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nknow why he mumbles, and has no ideas about how I could help him speak up<br/>\nwhen he needs something.  So I&#39;ve tried to address it with him.  But we<br/>\nhaven&#39;t found the answer yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n-- <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://temptabo.blogspot.com/\">http://temptabo.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12950,"nextTopicId":34460}}
