Open my eyes.***<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I really like how Bob put it.  That&#39;s pretty much what I did when my  <br/>\ndaughter asked me to play Polly Pockets with her. At first, I was  <br/>\nbored to tears with the idea of playing Polly Pockets but,  I found  <br/>\nthat I enjoyed myself and she felt filled up faster when I put 100%  <br/>\ninto playing Polly Pockets with her the way SHE wanted me to play.  I  <br/>\ndropped any agendas I may have had running through my head and  <br/>\nimmersed myself in her imaginary world as best as I could.  If I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t saying the right words for my Polly Pocket, I asked my daughter  <br/>\nto tell me what to say long enough that I understood the theme of her  <br/>\nimagination that day.  She liked to repeat themes - often we played  <br/>\nthat our dolls were sisters who&#39;s mom had left us home alone together.  <br/>\nWe talked about fashion and boys and going to parties.  I had to  <br/>\nintentionally push out thoughts like - What am I going to fix for  <br/>\ndinner? It was almost like a type of meditation to be able to focus so  <br/>\ncompletely on my daughter&#39;s play and desire to have me with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs with so many other needs, I found that when I was able to meet this  <br/>\nneed of hers and fill her up with my focused attention doing what she  <br/>\nwanted, she would soon enough be ready to play on her own and I was  <br/>\nexcused to go do whatever I wanted.  Sometimes, I wanted to stay and  <br/>\nplay - I was enjoying listening to the inner-workings of her  <br/>\nimagination and we were having fun together!<br/>\n<br/>\nPolly Pocket playing happened when Zoe was 4,5,6 & 7 ish if I remember  <br/>\ncorrectly, maybe up to age 9. She&#39;s 13 now and she still has a big box  <br/>\nof dolls and accessories under her bed that she never plays with but I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t wanted to store them in the basement or give them away or sell  <br/>\nthem because that box of dolls reminds me of so many happy times with  <br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last night, she was excited to receive and play a new video game  <br/>\n-- she LOVES Little Big Planet 2! It&#39;s a single or multi-player game  <br/>\ndepending on how you want to play it.  You can play online with others  <br/>\nif you want.  She was wanting to play solo last night so that she  <br/>\ncould explore it&#39;s features thoroughly without interruption.  She kept  <br/>\nturning down her online friends&#39; invites to join them or requests to  <br/>\nlet them join her!  However, she didn&#39;t want to be alone as she  <br/>\nexperienced this long-awaited excitement!  So, I sat in the living  <br/>\nroom while she played.  I read my email or played my own games (Plants  <br/>\nvs. Zombies thanks to Sandra!) on my iPad while she played  and I was  <br/>\nable to pause what I was doing whenever she wanted me to pay more  <br/>\nattention to some new, fantastic feature of the game that she was  <br/>\nplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that the more present you can be for your daughter now the  <br/>\nbetter connected you will feel to her in the future.  Sharing her  <br/>\nlife, thoughts, interests and fun with you is probably the most  <br/>\nimportant way for her to connect with you and the time you invest in  <br/>\nmeeting her need for your participation in her play and activities now  <br/>\nwill payoff down the road when she&#39;s older and more capable of  <br/>\nentertaining herself without your help. And, you might just find that  <br/>\nplaying Polly Pockets is kind of fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nChris in IA<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45956,"nextTopicId":45987}}
