Julian has three","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-44133347\">The issue of bribes comes up quite a bit, and I want to just weigh in on  the <br/>\npositive side of a bribe, just to keep things interesting.<br/>\n <br/>\nJulian has three parents. Two of them have those signatures that start out  <br/>\nwith maybe one letter and turns into a scrawl at the end. You know the ones --  <br/>\nthe signatures where when you go to cash their checks they have to check the  <br/>\nsignature card at the bank, or the cashier gives the person a strange look.  <br/>\n(Needless to say, I am NOT the parent with the scrawl signature.) It drives me <br/>\n insane.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen he was younger, I told Julian that I did not care even a little bit if  <br/>\nhe ever did cursive, except that I really wanted him to have a legible  <br/>\nsignature. I was willing to bribe him. He found this hilarious, and accepted the  <br/>\nbribe. (Or at least the idea of the bribe. Neither of us remembers what the  <br/>\nbribe was or if he ever received it.) Julian now has a  <br/>\nnot-particularly-pretty-but perfectly-legible signature. He never uses cursive  for anything else. We <br/>\nare both happy.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think the guidelines are: Make it clear that the issue is the parent&#39;s.  <br/>\nMake it clear that the kid does NOT have to accept it and there will be no hard  <br/>\nfeelings. Make it clear and light that you are aware that you are bribing the <br/>\n kid.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s our only bribery story. I wonder if I could bribe  him <br/>\nto do more stuff now.... hmmm...<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n**************A Good Credit Score is 700 or Above.
