I know a guy in TN who loved<br/>\nblacksmithing and ironwork, and he worked for a local shop (really sort of a<br/>\nfactory) after he completed some coursework in metalsmithing.  They made<br/>\niron gates.  Maybe just talking around with some of these folks with your<br/>\nson would be a good start.
