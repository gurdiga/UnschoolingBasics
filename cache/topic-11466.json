It was sometime after <br/>\nOctober 2005 when we pulled Caleb out of school. I had the &#39;school at <br/>\nhome&quot; mentality at that time.  I have read alot and was interested in <br/>\nunschooling before joining the group.  I joined the group to find out <br/>\nmore and I am learning, and I&#39;m trying to understand Caleb more. <br/>\nI was concerned about motivating him and I&#39;m relaxing alot in that <br/>\narea.  I&#39;m at the &quot;relaxed eclectic with a touch of unschooling&quot; mode <br/>\nright now.  We will do the required testing the week after Easter and <br/>\nI&#39;m not &quot;slap tore up about it&quot; like I would have been without this <br/>\ngroup.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nJanis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124939329,"authorName":"Ellen Christian","from":"Ellen Christian &lt;scentednights2002@...&gt;","profile":"scentednights2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Comments for Ellen on school","postDate":"1144607273","msgId":11467,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDA5MTgyNzUzLjQzNDU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyNzAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxYmZ1YisxMGtpOEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11466,"nextInTopic":11471,"prevInTime":11466,"nextInTime":11468,"topicId":11466,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks very much, Drusila.

(the school asked he not be brought back ever","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2075927364\">Dear Ellen,<br/>\n This year we took our 11yrold son out of Public School after a <br/>\nsuicide attempt made at school.<br/>\n (the school asked he not be brought back ever because they saw him <br/>\nas a danger to staff and other students)<br/>\n Why did my son attempt suicide?<br/>\n1) the teachers consistantly gave him the feeling he was not good <br/>\nenough. (although he made good grades)<br/>\n2) the children picked up on the teachers frustration with my son <br/>\nand mad him into a target.<br/>\n3)it is my feeling that some teachers alowed other students to abuse <br/>\nmy son because in some petty way they enjoyed &quot;making him pay&quot; for <br/>\nbeing anoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow was my son &#39;anoying&#39;?<br/>\n1) he did not sit still 8 hours a day<br/>\n2) he asked a million &quot;weird questions&quot; (currious anyone?) that did <br/>\nnot have to do directly with the lesson at hand but was a train of <br/>\nthought (learning anyone?)<br/>\n3) he did weird &quot;fun&quot; things like make up bizare rhymes<br/>\n4) being Very bright it was hard not to blurt out answers when no <br/>\none else in the class would answer.<br/>\n5) he was &quot;disorganised&quot; and would often lose or misplace things or <br/>\nforget items needed.<br/>\n6) he simply craved freedom to be himself and kids who are unique <br/>\nindividuals so not do well among Quasi robots.<br/>\n7) we had been learning together at home for years and durring the <br/>\nsummers and he was smarter than his classmates, we also did not hide <br/>\nanything from him so anything he ever asked we answered honestly.<br/>\n This makes for a child who doesnt believe some of the BS taught to <br/>\nthem in a structured classroom and will question it- causing the <br/>\nteacher embarassment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did I wait so long to take him out of school?<br/>\n1) he thought he LOVED school and begged me not to take him out <br/>\n(even though it was making him miserable)-- actualy he &quot;loved&quot; it <br/>\nbecause he had some hope that if he could be the right person or do <br/>\nand say or wear the right thing he would find acceptance with a peer <br/>\ngroup and he did not see any other way to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) althought I never wanted him to go to School I fell for the &quot;he <br/>\nwill be isolated and not recieve socalization&quot; The Drs said it, My <br/>\nfamily is dead set against homeschoioling for that reason, my <br/>\nhusband was buying into it and very strongly against homeschooling <br/>\nin the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I was made to feel on many levels that what I wanted to do was <br/>\nchild neglect. and I was made to feel parrinoid as if the cops would <br/>\nshow up and arrest me any day!!<br/>\n No &quot;rules&quot;= neglect<br/>\n No forced learning = neglect<br/>\n No punishment= neglect<br/>\n<br/>\nit was my fear and my guilt that stopped me many times from just <br/>\nputting my foot down and stopping it all. I guess (sadly) for me to <br/>\nstep up it had to all come to a head. Its a hard thing to feel like <br/>\nyou are standing up to the whole world for what you believe unless <br/>\nyou can &quot;PROVE&quot; your child needs this. <br/>\n I should have been braver sooner and I regret that I was not, but I <br/>\ncan;&#39;t go back and redo things. what I can do is go forward and tell <br/>\nmy story and hope that what we went through will help someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn rules and learning them at school.<br/>\nMy home has what you might call rules, heck sometimes we call <br/>\nthe &#39;rules&#39; and they have natuaral concequences and there are <br/>\nreasons for every single one. <br/>\n we dont hit or lie (or any number of things) because it hurts other <br/>\npeople- physical, emotionaly ect and it causes a lack of trust and a <br/>\nbreakdown of our relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am working hard to let go of one particular &quot;rule&quot; which has no <br/>\nreal reasoning behind it for my son. its the &quot;sweets come after good <br/>\nfood&quot; rule. *I* have to adhere to it because of a bloodsugar issue <br/>\nso naturaly I applied it to everyone in our house without reasoning <br/>\nor forethought. why did I do that? in retrospect because its hard to <br/>\nbe the one eating cheese or somthing while surrounded by people <br/>\neating Icecream sundays. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat rules do kids learn at school realy?<br/>\n sit down<br/>\n shut up<br/>\n hold still<br/>\n Do what you are told when you are told without question.<br/>\n &quot;because I said so&quot; is an acceptable reason.<br/>\n Hold in your Pee and poop till an adult allows you to relieve <br/>\nyourself. (?? wth??)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nwhat else do they learn in public school?<br/>\n My son was Taught everything he needed to know to pass the test so <br/>\nthe school could get money.<br/>\n<br/>\nhe was never taught to think for himself.<br/>\nhe was not taught to draw conclusions or reason.<br/>\nwhen he DID think for himself he was repremanded and punished.<br/>\n<br/>\nhe learned that if you dont fit in you dont deserve to live. <br/>\n(suicide attempt)<br/>\n<br/>\nhe wasnt old enough for his peers to teach him to smoke, drink or do <br/>\ndrugs and make creative lies about it.<br/>\nhe wasnt old enough for his peers to teach him that girls are not <br/>\npeople and only objects to have sex with.<br/>\n<br/>\nand those are just a few of the things Im glad my son didnt learn at <br/>\nschool, I could go on but I wont.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is amazingly happy now, he is doing well in all areas of his <br/>\nlife and as a family we are SLOWLY making the adjustments needed to <br/>\ntransition from a schooling to homeschooling and finaly to an <br/>\nunschooling family.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway Ellen,<br/>\n I hope this has in some way helped you and not offended you.<br/>\nperhaps try it for 6 months or a year and reevaluate then. I am <br/>\nwilling to bet your child will not be the only one learning a few <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I also hope I dont get any hate male from anyone because I can&#39;t <br/>\nchange the past and I know that some people here may feel strongly <br/>\nabout my story)<br/>\n<br/>\nD</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11420,"nextTopicId":11450}}
