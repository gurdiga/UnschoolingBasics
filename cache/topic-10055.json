My<br/>\n  brother died of cancer at 18. My sister died of cancer at 33. My<br/>\n  mother is mentally ill and only sort of normal part of the time, and<br/>\n  that normal time was never when we grew up, the stress of life was too<br/>\n  much for her wobbly brain to handle.<br/>\n  Life is *not* fair, but we don&#39;t need to be reminded about it. We need<br/>\n  comfort and support and sometimes a big hug.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  There was so much comfort and support coming my way when my sister<br/>\n  died after 2 years of horrid treatments. Some of my clients called in<br/>\n  a conference call to my home the day after Dawn died to try to cheer<br/>\n  me up and got my answering machine, I was picking out<br/>\n  casket/flowers/tequila/etc...<br/>\n  And this is what I hear, a room full of women (all of whom I really<br/>\n  liked and still am friends with today 10 yrs later) trying to be<br/>\n  cheerful in their lovely Texas rose way and say nice things on my<br/>\n  answering machine and then they all burst into huge rolling sobs,<br/>\n  tears so bad they could not continue speaking. They had to hang up and<br/>\n  call back, embarrassed and apologizing for not being *supportive*.<br/>\n  That was THE MOST comforting message I have ever<br/>\n  gotten and I told them so.<br/>\n  I miss my family of origin with all of my heart, most days. Time does<br/>\n  not heal all wounds. Some wounds never close. But with time the good<br/>\n  memories slip back in too, not just the losses.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  I tell you that for me some mess is not that bad, too much mess is a<br/>\n  home out of control and I need to get off my franny and stop whining<br/>\n  and bless my family and myself by cleaning up. I like an organized,<br/>\n  slightly decluttered home, nice clothes washed and folded and put<br/>\n  away, I like toilets that don&#39;t stink just as much as the next person.<br/>\n  I do what I can for myself and to bless my family (love that<br/>\n  Flylady.net!! She&#39;s so positive) and the rest is<br/>\n  proof that my babies are ALIVE and able to run around on their own 2 legs.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  We are raising children and they are gathering memories of their<br/>\n  family of origin. Maria Montessori said The Child is the Father of the<br/>\n  Man. What will our grown children remember about their childhood? How<br/>\n  with that shape who they are? I hope that my children remember that I,<br/>\n  their mother, cleaned up *happily* after my family, not being too<br/>\n  snobby or mean to be the servant of my cherished family (Christ washed<br/>\n  his disciples feet, and they were grown men, certainly *able* to wash<br/>\n  their own feet). <br/>\n  I hope that my children<br/>\n  remember that I valued their feelings more than I valued my<br/>\n  possessions and that I &quot;freely shared&quot; all that was originally mine so<br/>\n  that they had things and a home of their own, given to them with love<br/>\n  as I myself received the gift of life with love. I hope that they<br/>\n  remember they are unconditionally loved for simply *existing*, not<br/>\n  based on what they chose or not chose to do, and that the choice is<br/>\n  really theirs, just as the choice to conceive and raise them was<br/>\n  really *my* choice (oh, yeah, dh had a fun part there too).<br/>\n  And, very importantly, when they are adults in their probably very<br/>\n  busy lives, I hope they remember to *call their mother*.
