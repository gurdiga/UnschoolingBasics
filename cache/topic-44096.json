We couldn&#39;t figure out how to fit<br/>\nan allowance into our already tight (so tight sometimes it&#39;s choosing<br/>\nfood or electric) budget. Our income fluctuates from week to week (my<br/>\npartner and I both work in retail) and we pay the bills as we can<br/>\nscrape together the money. A set allowance wouldn&#39;t work, because<br/>\nsome weeks the only $5 left over isn&#39;t really left over because we<br/>\nneed to get gas. I&#39;m sure some of you have been there before.<br/>\nSuddenly it hit me . . . a percentage! He now gets 1% of all of our<br/>\nincome. If/when I start getting child support again (not holding my<br/>\nbreath on that one) then we&#39;ll give him a higher percentage of that<br/>\nparticular income. Some weeks he gets $5, this week he got $8, some<br/>\nweeks it may be even more. This works out well because the more hours<br/>\nwe work, the more we ask for help keeping the house running, so where<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel right paying him for helping exactly, it does feel right<br/>\nthat when he&#39;s more inconvenienced (by spending more time alone, less<br/>\ntime with someone to drive him to where he wants to go, etc.) he gets<br/>\nmore money.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, he wanted more. So I helped him place an ad on craigslist as<br/>\na mothers helper. We didn&#39;t get a single response, which is somewhat<br/>\nunderstandable . . . most people wouldn&#39;t think a 10 y/o boy would be<br/>\ncapable of being a mothers helper.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days ago I mentioned the idea of volunteering at a store that<br/>\nsells things he&#39;s interested in. That way he could trade his time for<br/>\nknowledge about the items he&#39;s interested in, as well as knowledge<br/>\nabout running a business. At first he was hesitant . . . &quot;I want<br/>\nMONEY!&quot;, but once I reccomended he try the Magic Card/ D&D / Comic<br/>\nshop he brightened up and started pointing out all of the positive<br/>\naspects to volunteering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe stopped by the card shop and were shot down by a very rude manager<br/>\nwho said point blank &quot;we just fired two people for theft, we&#39;re not<br/>\nallowing anyone to work in this store&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were driving home, Draven pointed out the little toy/hobby<br/>\nshop within walking distance of our house.
