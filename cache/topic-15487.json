When he was a bit younger, he was  <br/>\ndrawn to the same type of children as your neighbors.  He had the idea <br/>\nthat they were &quot;cool&quot;.  The were unkind, threatening, and just plain <br/>\nmean to him.  Usually I would take the time to try and educate about <br/>\nmy son and his intentions, but I felt it was better to remove him from <br/>\nany contact (without him being aware, of course).<br/>\nWe went about becoming friends with our neighbors with grown children, <br/>\nthe local merchants, the mailman, etc.  Usually adults, but that is <br/>\nwho he relates to best.  During the summer, we keep different hours <br/>\nthan most families.  Up real late playing in the sprinklers, sleeping <br/>\nin til noon.  That way we miss most of the kids on school break.  And <br/>\nwe have only had good experiences with our homeschool groups, <br/>\nespecially the unschooling families.  They have been so wonderfully <br/>\naccepting of him. So much so that the label of autism has pretty much <br/>\ndisappeared from discussion, and he is just James, the kinda odd, but <br/>\nreally neat kid.<br/>\nI have had parents tell me that it is not natural to only surround my <br/>\nson with people who are so kind and tolerant, that he needs to learn <br/>\nto deal with the &quot;real&quot; world (i guess they mean bullies and <br/>\nmeanies).  I would not put my other son or myself in that position.  <br/>\nWhy would I do that to my most vulnerable child?  <br/>\nMicki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"an issue for us","postDate":"1152497258","msgId":15510,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4c2NwYStnaWhnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15507,"nextInTopic":15617,"prevInTime":15509,"nextInTime":15511,"topicId":15487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you feel his safety is at risk (sounds like a lot of damage has been done) I would do something.

Neighbors can suck the wind out of a child&#39;s (and parent)happiness  <br/>\nthat&#39;s for sure as can friendships that change. My son (and I) have both endured  <br/>\nboth. <br/>\n <br/>\nI can tell you I didn&#39;t forbid friendships though I did talk with him  about <br/>\nit.  He knew I was looking out for his heart and I knew it was  important for <br/>\nhim to handle it. He stood his ground, a once timid boy with not  many friends <br/>\nis now a young man (my eyes are welling up,lol) with many friends  and highly <br/>\nregarded as the go to/take along guy. I watched him at the convention  walk <br/>\nwith two nervous girls (at diff times) into teen events.  Something several <br/>\nyears ago he would never have done even with support like the  girls had. <br/>\nUnschooling changed our lives in so many ways...:)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy point is he needs time, distractions and you until he finds his way..  and <br/>\nhe will.<br/>\nGo do something special when those kids are out and he sees them. Leave  <br/>\nbefore if you know an event is taking place. Just for now while his heart heals  <br/>\nand his body grows.<br/>\n <br/>\nI wish you and your son Galen a peaceful summer<br/>\n((((hugs)))<br/>\nLaura<br/>\nUnschoolingmaine.com<br/>\n***************************************************************************<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;I fear for him that if I do not take some measures to insist he  <br/>\nstay away from these kids that he will not learn fast enough and <br/>\nwill  end up in the hospital.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas, advice, comments? <br/>\nEspecialy welcome  from people with kids who may have the same issues <br/>\nas  Galen?<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks.<br/>\nDiana&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141440271,"authorName":"drusila00","from":"&quot;drusila00&quot; &lt;drusila00@...&gt;","profile":"drusila00","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: an issue for us","postDate":"1152462241","msgId":15490,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4cmFqMSt0bGo4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU4cjhzNCt2bzBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15487,"nextInTopic":15507,"prevInTime":15489,"nextInTime":15491,"topicId":15487,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I should have added, the parents speak no english so discussing the matter with them is out. their kids can translate but then I would have to rely on the kids","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1578875418\">I should have added, the parents speak no english so discussing the <br/>\nmatter with them is out. their kids can translate but then I would <br/>\nhave to rely on the kids who lie and beat my child to be honest about <br/>\nwhat they are saying.
