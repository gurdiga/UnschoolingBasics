Since when did <br/>\nbeing subjected to bullying make you a better person?  Bitter maybe, <br/>\nbut not better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a thought on the &quot;checkmark&quot; system.  I would ask my now 5 yr <br/>\nold what they did at school today and I got a police report.  So and <br/>\nso sat in the yellow time out chair twice, so and so got clips <br/>\npulled and didn&#39;t get to play in the afternoon circle time games, <br/>\netc.  The first time he got a clip pulled he was devastated and <br/>\nthat&#39;s all he could talk about.  He said &quot;I have some really bad <br/>\nnews, Mom.&quot;  He hung his head in shame (he got it for goofing off in <br/>\nthe bathroom - so some discipline was warranted, I&#39;m sure, but then <br/>\nagain, I was against letting 5 year olds go to the &quot;big boy <br/>\nbathroom&quot; without teacher supervision from the get go.  You can&#39;t <br/>\nsend kids into a virtual playground and not expect them to goof <br/>\noff.  As it turns out, the teacher paired my son with the &quot;trouble&quot; <br/>\nkids so he could help keep them in line.  Hello?!?!?  But I have <br/>\ndigressed terribly now, sorry!).  He was sad and moping and assured <br/>\nme the next morning that it wouldn&#39;t happen again.  Like I was <br/>\ndisappointed in him beyond redemption.  That&#39;s too much pressure for <br/>\na kid.  Let&#39;s get real.  How about a hug and &quot;we don&#39;t play in the <br/>\nbathroom because it&#39;s wet and someone could get hurt&quot; instead of <br/>\nmaking a kid feel that he has failed at something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve only had my boys home for a month, but I&#39;m cherishing the time <br/>\nI get to spend with them every day.

That and banks, post offices, hospitals, etc, to me are different.  You don&#39;t want someone right behind you overhearing or seeing your bank account number, money, medical records, etc.  So there I agree with the single line thing.  I guess to me the single line at the grocery store doesn&#39;t seem more efficient because you have people who don&#39;t see/hear the signal to go to the lane so they are just standing there unaware blocking the line till someone yells at them, and the stores I&#39;ve been to have a short line for this mass line, when you could have 5  shorter lines in the space they have between the main line and the actual checkers.  Not to mention being able to unload your cart while the previous person is paying.  I guess it is all about what seems time consuming/efficient to you.  That, and I actually don&#39;t mind waiting in a line at a checkout stand, even if the person in the next lane over gets out faster.  Somehow being in place for my next task with some time to let my mind rest and not have to do anything is like a mini vacation for me.  But I&#39;m funny that way.  I can see how the main line would be better in many situations though, I guess I never thought of it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184851440,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;poey@...&gt;","profile":"raggedymommyof2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: along the line of unsupportive family","postDate":"1137146810","msgId":9019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMWIwMWM2MTgyOSQxMmM0MDVjMCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGRxOTZxZCtvdTRvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9018,"nextInTopic":9020,"prevInTime":9018,"nextInTime":9020,"topicId":8997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Christy, I can see your point there.

And it does resolve the issue my husband has of scoping all the aisles, picking one, getting frustrated, switching lanes, seeing the other lane empty now, going back, getting behind someone with a million items, coupons, and sales papers to contradict the prices, etc.  My problem is I have trouble concentrating in areas with lots of people, so standing in a line with lots of people waiting for one out of 5-10 lanes to signal me, I can&#39;t focus to know when I&#39;ve been signaled (I have the same problem at banks so I rarely go in them).  As for the blocked aisle, I completely agree with you, but I always seem to miss something on an aisle and have to go back, so that part of the line thing drove me nuts.  Especially with the retirees jumping on you if you left the line to go back for whatever you missed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if I wasn&#39;t so disorganized and distracted lines would work better for me.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184851440,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;poey@...&gt;","profile":"raggedymommyof2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: along the line of unsupportive family","postDate":"1137140456","msgId":9011,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYTcwMWM2MTgxYSQ0NmZmNzE4MCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGRxOG1yNCttN2dwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9008,"nextInTopic":9013,"prevInTime":9010,"nextInTime":9012,"topicId":8997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One thing I find absurd about military life is some of the ways they use lines and ques.

At the grocery store on base (called a commissary), you have to stand in one big line and wait for a checker at a check out stand to signal you she is clear so you can go to her stand.  So if there are 5 checkout lanes with checkers at them, you can&#39;t pick one of the 5 and line up at it, you have to stand in a main line until one of the five has taken care of the customer they have and signaled you to come to them.  Some bases even have an electronic sign that will light up with an arrow or a number to tell you which lane to go to.  I have no idea WHY they do it this way, but it drives me nuts.  When we first got married and I went to a commissary for the first time, they actually had ARROWS on the floor, that you had to travel in a certain direction through the aisles!!  You couldn&#39;t just go back and forth, you basically got in a line that weaved up and down the aisles till you got to the end and got to the checkout.  If you forgot something while you were on an aisle, forget it, you couldn&#39;t go back, and if you got out of line, one of the retirees there would yell at you (I don&#39;t know if these people worked there or just hung out there to yell at other people).  It frustrated me so much I wouldn&#39;t go back into a commissary for 5 years.  The other commissaries I&#39;ve been in haven&#39;t had the aisle flow lines, I don&#39;t know if that was just specific to that base or an old practice that was done away with during my boycott, but they all the ones I&#39;ve been to have had the line to wait for a checkout lane.  It&#39;s kind of like when you are at a bank and waiting for a teller window, which I can understand there, but at a grocery store??<br/>\n<br/>\n°Ü°  Tina Rod.  °Ü°<br/>\n<br/>\nDysfunctional Domestic Diva<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184851440,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;poey@...&gt;","profile":"raggedymommyof2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] along the line of unsupportive family","postDate":"1137139506","msgId":9008,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOWIwMWM2MTgxOCQxMTU5ODkwMCQ1ZTA5NzcxOEBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PGRxOGs3aStzM3VlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":9001,"nextInTopic":9011,"prevInTime":9007,"nextInTime":9009,"topicId":8997,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve only had my boys home for a month, but I m cherishing the time I get to spend with them every day.

I remember when my daughter first wrote her name, and my son did his first subtraction problem, I was so excited and happy to see them accomplish these things!!  It was a big deal, we called people, we celebrated, we cheered!!  I thought about how many people send their kids to day care or school and these things happen and they don&#39;t even know it unless they see the papers.  How many things did my son learn last year in school that slipped past my radar?  But now they are all mine!!  I feel kind of selfish feeling that way, but I don&#39;t want to share them or give them away to another person/teacher.
