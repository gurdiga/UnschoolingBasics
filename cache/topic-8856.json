We never prodded,<br/>\nor pushed or did ANYTHING. He was in the bathroom with me when I went<br/>\nfrom the time he was born pretty much, he went everywhere I went, so<br/>\nby the time he was mobile, he would follow me in there some of the time.<br/>\nHe knew what it was for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe day he decided to use a toilet, he also decided the next day to<br/>\nuse underwear and from that day on he stayed dry at night!! That was a<br/>\nbig surprise for me because none of my other children had night time<br/>\ncontrol for quite a while after they learned to use a toilet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was literally an overnight event in Jalen&#39;s case. My older children<br/>\n varied a bit, Sierra being fascinated with it all at two and wanting<br/>\nto sit on a toilet, but not actually using it until closer to three.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think three is really young. Forget what the &quot;experts&quot; say and trust<br/>\nyour child to learn when he is good and ready. No stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8869,"nextTopicId":8775}}
