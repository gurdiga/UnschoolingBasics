This balance includes <br/>\ntime for me, too. Granted, much of &quot;my time&quot; is at the gym, and I&#39;ve had <br/>\nto make peace with the child care provided there. When I reflected on <br/>\nthe child care, I realized there were many positives: my kids get to <br/>\nhang out with other children from different cultures - and this is their <br/>\nprimary opportunity for experiencing diversity these days. Also, the <br/>\ncaregiver is from an entirely different culture, which is great for my <br/>\ngirls to experience, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kids spent a LOT of time with their dad (my husband, too!) on <br/>\nweeknights and weekends. I&#39;m grateful that my husband has adjusted to <br/>\nthis over time, b/c I really needed some time to regroup and <br/>\nre-energize. We both realize that we need time away in order to bring <br/>\nour best to the family....<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: responsibilities other than the kids, we&#39;re still working that part <br/>\nout. Domestic chores definitely take a hit. I  do the dishes and a <br/>\ncouple of loads of wash each day, and try to pick up the clutter as we <br/>\ngo along.  As for the rest, it either gets left for &quot;tomorrow,&quot; or one <br/>\nof us has a burst of energy or inspiration and does the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps?

That way you&#39;re not putting passions aside for obligations, but choosing between things which give you joy and fulfillment. There Are natural limits, after all, and the 24-hour day is one of them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to think about learning and growing - neither are straightforward and linear, but move forward and swirl around, form eddies and backwaters, stall and sometimes stagnate for a time before rushing onward. So its okay if some passions are sitting in a little backwater, resting for now. Everything you&#39;re learning and doing Now will contribute to your future growing and learning in small ways you can&#39;t possibly predict. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":237699340,"authorName":"Kristie","from":"Kristie &lt;messy_boys@...&gt;","profile":"messy_boys","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"making time for my interests, too","postDate":"1317857579","msgId":47437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTc4NTc1NzkuODQzMTIuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViODExMDcubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47457,"prevInTime":47436,"nextInTime":47438,"topicId":47437,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One of the things that excites me about unschooling is the possibility that *I* will have the time to explore some of my own interests!
