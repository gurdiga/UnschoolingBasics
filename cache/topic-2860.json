I had a cow when my mom told me <br/>\nabout this diagnosis. He is a troubled kid in some ways, and is in <br/>\ntherapy, but that&#39;s because of his neurotic mother and years of catholic <br/>\nschool, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow are doctors arriving at this conclusion? I know nothing about the <br/>\ntesting, but I am hoping they don&#39;t just pump him full of meds based on <br/>\nthis diagnosis.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thursday, August 19, 2004, at 10:32 AM, Ulrike Haupt wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my brothers was what we then called a &#39;Zappelphillip&#39;.
