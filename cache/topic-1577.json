My daughter, now 5.8, was 18<br/>\nmonths when I got &quot;oops&quot; pregnant with my son, now 3.5.  I freaked out a lot<br/>\nabout what this was going to do to our relationship.  My observation of my<br/>\nown and others experiences is that how difficult this will feel to Caroline<br/>\nwill likely have a lot to do with both her temperment (easy going / medium /<br/>\nspirited?) and the temperment of your new baby.  If your baby is easy going,<br/>\nthe baby might not have too much of an impact on Caroline until s/he starts<br/>\ncrawling over and grabbing her toys, by which time she&#39;ll be 3.  Even if you<br/>\nare extremely unlucky, like me, and you have a spirited toddler and you get<br/>\na high need baby I have some good news for you - even though the first year<br/>\nwill be rough (I hope you have a support system closeby in this event), the<br/>\ncloseness of age will pay off hugely.  My daughter had a really difficult<br/>\ntime with her brother and it took us 8 months to get to the point where I<br/>\nfelt she had accepted his existence in our lives.  Now they are best of<br/>\nfriends, play so well together and share interests, calls him her &quot;bestest<br/>\nbrother&quot;, protects him fiercely and she cannot possibly imagine life without<br/>\nhim.  There is so much love there it is just an awesome sight.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I never told my daughter that she should act or be any<br/>\ndifferently now that she had a brother.

My son <br/>\nwas 14 months old when my daughter was born.  During my pregnancy I <br/>\nhad some bed rest and I wasn&#39;t suppose to lift anything more than 10 <br/>\nlbs.  Needless to say I did a lot of walking holding his hands and <br/>\nhelping him walk since I couldn&#39;t lift him.  He took his first steps <br/>\nat 9 1/2 months and was really walking at 10 months.  I have always <br/>\nfelt that we kind of made him grow up fast in those ways you are <br/>\nsuppose to enjoy all the firsts especialy with your first child.  I <br/>\nwas also working full time.  The first two years of his life are very <br/>\nblurry and I feel very guilty about not remembering a lot without <br/>\nlooking at pictures and rereading my sparse journal. I try not to <br/>\nfocus so much on that time, but to put more energy into the here and <br/>\nnow.  Today my children are 4 1/2 and 5 1/2.  They are very close and <br/>\nmiss each other when the other is not around.  I try to think that it <br/>\nwas the best thing that I could do for them was to give them each <br/>\nother.  I have always tried not to say you&#39;re the big brother so you <br/>\nhave to do this or know better. Occasionally now I will ask him to <br/>\nhelp her tie her shoe etc., because I think 1)it gives him great <br/>\npride to do it, 2)it is helpful to me, and 3) she wants to learn and <br/>\nhe loves to teach her things because it makes him feel bigger.  I <br/>\nalso give him some special time with me.  I let him stay up later <br/>\nsometimes and he can attend events that she can&#39;t because of his <br/>\nage.  They are so close in age that I normally don&#39;t think of them <br/>\nany differently.  They both have &quot;jobs&quot; to do around the house and <br/>\nbefore she was even old enough to understand I would give her &quot;time <br/>\nouts&quot; when she  &quot;misbehaved&quot; to show him that they were both being <br/>\ntreated equally.  Although it was very difficult those first three <br/>\nyears, I can&#39;t imagine having done it any differently now.  I am now <br/>\na stay at home mom and I realize that my son is just fine.  He <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be hurt at all by having only had me to himself for <br/>\n14 months.

I sometimes think that I broke my daughters heart<br/>\nand she is just starting to forgive me.  We have a family bed, (I should say<br/>\nmattresses lined up on the floor), now and no one is or ever will be<br/>\nexcluded.  She&#39;s finally, and she&#39;s 11, becoming more comfortable with sleep<br/>\nissues.  I can&#39;t look back at her very young childhood and feel good about<br/>\nanything I put her through, and when I ask myself why all I get for an<br/>\nanswer is that it was all out of my own selfishness.
