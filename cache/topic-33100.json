I had to share this story of our son, then 2 years old, and how<br/>\nhe was very clear about that line when it came to diapers/toilet time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne day I was changing his diaper and he looked up at me and explained the<br/>\nways of the Universe to me. &quot;I pee, you clean me up; I poop, you clean me<br/>\nup! As this was not a role I planned on fulfilling forever, and since I<br/>\nfigured if his reasoning worked this well, it was time to try it without<br/>\ndiapers! (He transitioned to the toilet in two days!)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know about all kids, but mine is pretty direct about telling me<br/>\nwhere he&#39;s at!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33097,"nextTopicId":33114}}
