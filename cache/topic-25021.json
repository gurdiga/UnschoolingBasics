Thanks to all of you who&#39;ve responded with your<br/>\ncumulative years of experience:-)  The point about allowing a child to grow<br/>\nin their trust of their own intuition and inner guidance cannot be repeated<br/>\noften enough, IMO. It can be so difficult to keep that idea at the forefront<br/>\nof our consciousness, where it belongs, when 25 things are happening at<br/>\nonce. My almost 4 yr old daughter rarely has temper tantrums (whining is<br/>\nanother matter LOL!), but she had her worst ever just last Saturday, and it<br/>\nwas because she was made to do something she really didn&#39;t want to do. I try<br/>\nto avoid this kind of thing, and will generally rearrange my whole schedule<br/>\nto accommodate her whenever I can. Last Saturday was an exception to that.<br/>\nShe was miserable and screamed and cried (long story short, we&#39;ve had a<br/>\nvisitor from France for 2.5 weeks - 15 yr old here to strengthen her English<br/>\nlanguage skills - and we had agreed to take her on a shopping trip to a<br/>\nlocal mall. This was the ONLY window to do it in, Lila did NOT want to go,<br/>\nbut there was absolutely no one who could stay with her. Ugh.)  She finally<br/>\nfell asleep, and slept through the whole shopping trip. Best thing she could<br/>\ndo, probably. Anyway, we had plans to tour the statue of liberty the next<br/>\nday. Lila, her baby sister, her uncle, her dad, our guest, and me, were all<br/>\nplanning on going. Lila woke up and didn&#39;t want to go. Without missing a<br/>\nbeat, my husband and I said, almost in unison, that of course she didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to go if she didn&#39;t want to. Her dad or I would stay home with her. She<br/>\npicked her dad. The rest of us went, and the trip just emphasized for me<br/>\nthat I should always trust Lila&#39;s intuition (except of course, in those<br/>\n&quot;life/death situations); she would have had a miserable time. Each leg of<br/>\nthe trip had things about it that Lila really doesn&#39;t like. I&#39;ve never been<br/>\nthere before, so I had no idea what to expect, but Lila was adamant that<br/>\nmorning; not &quot;I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; it was simply &quot;No, I&#39;m not going.&quot; She<br/>\nhad the best day with her dad, and she clearly felt respected and honored -<br/>\nshe even thanked me for going without her, because she knew how much I&#39;d<br/>\nmiss her! This has happened repeatedly throughout her short life; she has a<br/>\nfeeling about something, and whether I recognize why she feels that way or<br/>\nnot, it invariably turns out to be spot on. Kids are so uncluttered by<br/>\ngarbage and skewed perspectives, I think we&#39;d be crazy to ignore their<br/>\nintuition and turn them against themselves, which is, in effect, what we do<br/>\nwhen we undermine their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all everyone has had to offer on this subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25019,"nextTopicId":25062}}
