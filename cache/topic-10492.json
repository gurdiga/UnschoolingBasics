The main stress is from others, but getting  <br/>\nuninterrupted time for yourself or for things that need to be done can be  challenging. <br/>\n Especially for someone sort of ADD like me.  :)  As  soon as I get started <br/>\npaying the bills, someone needs some sort of  attention.  Then I lose my bill <br/>\npaying momentum!<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it also depends on what your kids are into at the moment.  If  it is <br/>\nsomething that you really enjoy, it is a joy.  If it is something  challenging <br/>\nfor you or takes a lot of time and effort, it can be a  stressor.  But <br/>\nchildren are going to have different interests, whether they  are unschooling or <br/>\nnot, so it is maybe more of a parenting stressor, not just an  unschooling one.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd truthfully, these stresses are incredibly minor compared to the  stresses <br/>\nof school life!  Just thinking about getting out of the house  dressed, fed <br/>\nand with homework and lunches gives me a panic attack!!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":158523003,"authorName":"sandralzires","from":"&quot;sandralzires&quot; &lt;sandralzires@...&gt;","profile":"sandralzires","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"stress in unschooling?","postDate":"1141749418","msgId":10501,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR1a2NyYStxdDlhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10492,"nextInTopic":10514,"prevInTime":10500,"nextInTime":10502,"topicId":10492,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Good am, Have you ever read Wayne Dyer?

I admit, I haven&#39;t gotten to the point where I can gracefully change the subject or just brush off the comments...I hope that will change in time.
