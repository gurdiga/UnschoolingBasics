Put it on the list. List cannot hold more <br/>\nthan x items (3 or 6 or so - fairly small number). Each item gets <br/>\ntagged with the cost and where it can be obtained - researching <br/>\nwhere to find things is important, sometimes you can find stuff <br/>\ncheaper online for example - so you&#39;d order it and your child would <br/>\npay whatever you paid for it (since they aren&#39;t typically allowed to <br/>\npurchase things online without your consent). If a new thing arises, <br/>\nsomething has to come off the list, research occurs, and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, maybe he&#39;d be amenable to your keeping 10% or whatever of his <br/>\nallowance in a separate &quot;pile&quot; for saving purposes - maybe even a <br/>\nbona fide savings account in his name (and yours).

We went to Best Buy (his <br/>\nchoice - videogames, Gameboy stuff, movies, music, all in one <br/>\nplace). We went into the store - I was carrying pen and paper per <br/>\nhis request. He&#39;d point out stuff he wanted, I&#39;d note the item and <br/>\nprice. I figured we&#39;d then stand there and he&#39;d pick what he wanted. <br/>\nI was wrong. He said &quot;Let&#39;s go out to the car&quot; so we did. While DH <br/>\nwas inside buying something with HIS Christmas giftcard, DS and I <br/>\nsat in the vehicle prioritizing and re-organizing the list until DS <br/>\nhad it sorted out the way he wanted, most bang for the buck style. <br/>\nThen we headed back inside. I figured Okay NOW he&#39;s going to run <br/>\ndown the list until the money runs out. Wrong again. He picked out <br/>\none item from the top 3 on the list (a DVD set that ran on the <br/>\nexpensive side at something like $30) and said &quot;Okay let&#39;s go pay <br/>\nfor this.&quot; I reminded him that he still had &quot;lots&quot; more money on the <br/>\ncard and more items on the list. He said &quot;Yeah, but this is all I <br/>\nwant to get right now&quot; and off we went.

For SURE we could have afforded  <br/>\nany of the individual items - it was the quantity of items that we  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t possible afford. So it seemed very confusing to the kid -  <br/>\none day we&#39;d be somewhere and see some cute earrings and I&#39;d say,  <br/>\n&quot;Sure, go ahead and get them,&quot; and another day I&#39;d say, &quot;We really  <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford them.&quot; &quot;I&quot; knew when money had been flowing out a lot -  <br/>\nif we&#39;d eaten out a lot that week or had some car repairs or even if  <br/>\nher sisters had spent more money than usual in the previous few days,  <br/>\netc., but that kind of constant awareness of how much money we were  <br/>\nspending, as a family, wasn&#39;t part of my young teenage daughter&#39;s  <br/>\ninternal knowledge base, like it was mine. So, not knowing when it  <br/>\nwas going to be okay to buy and when it wasn&#39;t, they were asking to  <br/>\nbuy everything, hoping this would be one of the, &quot;Sure, buy it,&quot; times.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was EASILY resolved by giving the kids a lot more control over  <br/>\nthe money. We talked about how much she thought was reasonable,  <br/>\n&quot;Well, I think it would be reasonable to buy one big thing and maybe  <br/>\n3 smaller things in a month.&quot; So we figured out how much money it  <br/>\nwould take for those things. If it had been too much, we&#39;d have  <br/>\ntalked about that -- but she was very reasonable - in fact it was  <br/>\nmuch less than what we WERE actually spending. So I got to be  <br/>\ngenerous and say, &quot;Well, let&#39;s give you that much plus $10 more each  <br/>\nmonth and then you buy all your own clothes and accessories out of  <br/>\nthat. That&#39;ll be your budget, so you can save it and buy more  <br/>\nexpensive things or spend it on little things or spend it on other  <br/>\nthings or whatever you want.&quot; We agreed that she wouldn&#39;t ASK for us  <br/>\nto buy her clothes that she couldn&#39;t afford, but that we reserved the  <br/>\nright to buy her gifts of clothing and jewelry if WE wanted to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cannot tell you how well this worked - it was amazing. I hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nrealized the background dread I&#39;d been feeling of having to  <br/>\nconstantly decide whether or not we could afford something and how I  <br/>\nhad been so often in the position of judging whether or not something  <br/>\nmy daughter wanted to purchase was worth the money. Now I didn&#39;t have  <br/>\nto think do that because SHE would decide if she wanted to buy it or  <br/>\nnot and I could give her advice, but I didn&#39;t have to feel  <br/>\nresponsible for her decisions. I gave advice like I would to my  <br/>\nfriend or sister - we could be out together and have fun again!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I&#39;m thinking you need a lego budget and he needs to keep track  <br/>\nof it so that he knows when he&#39;s choosing one kit that means he&#39;ll  <br/>\nhave to wait until next month for another one. Or he knows that if he  <br/>\nwants that really huge expensive kit, he&#39;ll have to not buy a smaller  <br/>\none right now and save that money to combine with next month&#39;s money  <br/>\nto afford the really big kit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso - about him making money - he might need to come up with the  <br/>\nidea himself, to be committed to doing it, and you both might need to  <br/>\nwork on your creative thinking abilities -- there are most definitely  <br/>\nways a kid can make some money and, once the two of you have come up  <br/>\nwith some that are doable for him, then he can choose to work on the  <br/>\nmoney-making or not buy so many kits - either way, his choice and you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to feel further guilt about not having an infinite amount  <br/>\nof money to pay for everything he might want.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo help with creative thinking:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne way to come up with more possible options is to come up with a  <br/>\nlist of ANY options, no matter how impossible they seem and then  <br/>\nmodify them like this example:<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea off the list: I could mow lawns.<br/>\n(Maybe that&#39;s not truly feasible - you don&#39;t have a lawnmower, the  <br/>\nkid is really too young for it to be safe, neighbors all have  <br/>\ngardeners, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you say, &quot;If not &quot;mow&quot; then ________.&quot; Fill in the blanks with  <br/>\nsome words - have fun with it by starting with goofy ideas because  <br/>\nthat helps get the creative juices flowing:<br/>\n<br/>\nwash, cut with scissors, cut with a tractor, shave with a razor,  <br/>\nwater, fertilize, pull weeds out, rake .....<br/>\n<br/>\nTry another one of the words, &quot;If not &quot;lawn,&quot; then ___________.&quot; Fill  <br/>\nin the blank - again, have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nsidewalk, ice, leaves, street, porch, swimming pool, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow put those two lists into the original idea -<br/>\n<br/>\nI could wash the leaves.<br/>\nI could shave the ice with a razor.<br/>\nI could water the sidewalk.<br/>\nI could fertilize the swimming pool.<br/>\nI could pull weeds out of the porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the middle of all that, you are likely to hear:<br/>\n<br/>\nHEY - maybe I really COULD water lawns or rake leaves or clean  <br/>\nswimming pools, mom!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing jumps out - use another one of the original ideas off the  <br/>\nlist and run through the same FUN process.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast thing - you don&#39;t have to come up with an answer right then -  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll have started the thinking process and you might need to let it  <br/>\nrattle around in your heads, not focusing on it for a while (day or  <br/>\ndays) and then, suddenly, something will pop into your heads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":219199726,"authorName":"Stacey Brumfield","from":"Stacey Brumfield &lt;stacy_brumfield@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Passions that cost lots of money?","postDate":"1147709924","msgId":13187,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNTE1MTYxODQ0LjkxMDY1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUzNjE0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13180,"nextInTopic":13188,"prevInTime":13186,"nextInTime":13188,"topicId":13162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok, I just joined last night, but had to throw in my 2 cents.

Or it can be used to find creative<br/>\nways to meet those needs.  Your son has found one in wanting to do jobs for<br/>\nmoney.  Perhaps he could expand this to neighbors.  Raking leaves, carrying<br/>\nan elderly neighbor&#39;s garbage to the street, cutting someone&#39;s lawn, pet<br/>\nsitting for vacationing neighbors.  Perhaps you could show him ways to find<br/>\nwhat he wants less expensively by going to ebay or other online places,<br/>\nthrift stores, garage sales, etc.  I&#39;m always seeing Legos at garage sales,<br/>\nthey may not be in their boxes, but if his passion is unlike Dan&#39;s to where<br/>\nhe wants new pieces to build things with, this might be a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Passions that cost lots of money?","postDate":"1147701082","msgId":13167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU0YTEwcSs2cWttQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0OXZvais3MGo4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13165,"nextInTopic":13173,"prevInTime":13166,"nextInTime":13168,"topicId":13162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... day ... he ... and ... but ... he ... do ... have ... to ...

Set aside x amount of money toward it <br/>\n(for example, $3/week if you can). If you can buy him kits &quot;when you <br/>\nhave the money&quot; maybe putting aside a little bit at a time, rather <br/>\nthan waiting an indeterminate time between things, would help him - <br/>\nhe could see that this week we have $3, next week we&#39;ll have $6 and <br/>\nso on - and on June 15th we&#39;ll have enough for kit A - unless I <br/>\nchoose to get less-expensive kit B on May 30 and delay getting kit A <br/>\nfor another 5 weeks. Works really well with my 8 yr old DS. He gets <br/>\nan allowance (free and clear, no chores or anything required), <br/>\npayable when I get paid (twice per month). He can save, spend, <br/>\nwhatever he chooses. It gives him some sense of when something will <br/>\nbe available - 2 allowances, 3 allowances, etc. When he first <br/>\nstarted getting an allowance a couple years ago, he saved for 2 full <br/>\nmonths because he wanted to get not one but two plastic, lights and <br/>\nsounds light sabers - can&#39;t battle with just one! When he had saved <br/>\nenough for one, I offered to chip in for the other (the timing fell <br/>\nright) but he refused - he wanted to buy them his own self. So he <br/>\ndid. And boy was he looking proud at the cash register! (I chipped <br/>\nin for the tax - we&#39;re just starting to discuss that factor now).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":182292076,"authorName":"Marie Pressman","from":"&quot;Marie Pressman&quot; &lt;pressmanm@...&gt;","profile":"pressmanm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Passions that cost lots of money?","postDate":"1147700416","msgId":13165,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PE5EQkJKTUlQRElJSkRQQ0NORkFCS0VQS0VCQUEucHJlc3NtYW5tQGNvYXN0YWxwcm9kdWN0cy5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGU0OXZvais3MGo4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13162,"nextInTopic":13167,"prevInTime":13164,"nextInTime":13166,"topicId":13162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Do I know all about your problem!

We have quite a collection.  Not<br/>\nto mention a box full of Lego pieces.  I keep trying to get him to focus on<br/>\nthat big box to make his own creations.  Often times he will make some<br/>\namazing things but it&#39;s never enough.  For awhile we were getting the<br/>\ncatalogs and he would make lists of the kits he wanted and the prices.  My<br/>\nson always has a hole burning in his pocket and desparately wants to make<br/>\nmoney but never wants to work very hard for it.  I find it very frustrating<br/>\nand exhausting.  He is very passionate but lately his passions have<br/>\nmultiplied.  I realize that I need to help him with some kind of business.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Marie<br/>\n<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of freepsgal<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, May 15, 2006 9:30 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Passions that cost lots of money?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  My son has always had a passion for Legos.
