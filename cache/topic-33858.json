For a <br/>\nwhile, maybe----but if the list is small, you won&#39;t have much to do <br/>\nanyway. As it grows, you can ask others who write a lot and who share <br/>\nthe same vision/philosophy to be your moderator(s).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to set up---in fact. I started a new list just today.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a little worried about taking on something like that as I had an <br/>\ninfant.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re not on the bigger list anymore, it really won&#39;t take any more <br/>\ntime---in fact, probably LESS because you won&#39;t allow the crap that <br/>\nyou&#39;re busy arguing against now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe difference is that you kind of have to READ every post that comes <br/>\nin. You don&#39;t necessarily have to answer each post. But I feel more <br/>\nobligated to answer many posts here than I do on list I don&#39;t own. That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean I answer *all* posts.

But no, one does *not* have to be <br/>\nsome kind of great writer. It&#39;s all about the SHARING of ideas. It <br/>\ncertainly helps if you can string a sentence together. &lt;g&gt; But you <br/>\ndon&#39;t have to be awe-inspiring! &lt;bwg&gt; The thing IS: the more you write, <br/>\nthe better and clearer your writing gets.
