That&#39;s my thing and it&#39;s ok. I&#39;ve read a few posts like yours on a couple different lists lately and I&#39;m grateful for them. They help me to solidify my commitment to unschooling. I didn&#39;t think you presented your mother in a bad light. I got what you meant. I wish my husband would get that. He supports me in homeschooling and unschooling but, if asked, he still says he doesn&#39;t see anything wrong with sending kids to school. It frustrates me to no end. He didn&#39;t have any problems or struggles in school and he just can&#39;t see others.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alysia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
