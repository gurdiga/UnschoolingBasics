When we <br/>\nbegan our family what i have found about radical unschooling was just the way our lives were <br/>\nand we thought always would be.  When our oldest was 3 we were pregnant, then in a BAD <br/>\ncar accident, we were all seperated, her with family memebers(that love her very much, but <br/>\ndid not live like us AT ALL), me in the hospital for four mo, Husband still at old house, <br/>\npacking and still working.  Twins born early, then 7 more weeks of hospital, Lil and I visiting <br/>\n2x a day.  We had to live with relatives for a few more months(i broke my pelvis in 3 places, <br/>\nand ankle in accident).  I am not whining, we are so very blessed, our babies were fine, some <br/>\ncomplications, but alive.  We ended up moving near my family, away from our lifestyle.  One <br/>\ntwin has epilepsy, and some developmental issues, between PT, OT, speech, MRI&#39;s. EEG&#39;s etc, <br/>\nwe are busy.  My fear is with no bedtime we would be battling to get out of the house.<br/>\n   This has sounded like a big pity party for me, it is not, I am lucky, I have three unique, <br/>\nterrific, fun, crazy kids, and am able to be with them.  I stayed up all night thinking about my <br/>\n&quot;failure&quot; to live the life we wanted, found lots of excuses not to try.  And saw sleeping next to <br/>\nme three terrific reasons to try.  We were happier before, and it can work, not easily for me, <br/>\nbut the end result will be worth it.  Sorry about the whining, I was more venting my thoughts <br/>\nthan complaining.
