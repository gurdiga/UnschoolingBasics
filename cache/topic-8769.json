","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-683033611\">Wow! I first just want to say that I am in awe that people that don&#39;t even <br/>\nknow me would take the time to respond so quickly in such a thoughtful, <br/>\ncaring way.<br/>\nI literally sat in tears as I read your words. Yes, I grew up in a very <br/>\ncontrolled environment. I am sure I was told constantly how to do <br/>\nsomething or not to do something at all. I remember some of it, but I have <br/>\nforgotten a lot too. When I read the line about the, &quot;little girl inside <br/>\nthat is scared and just trying to hold her world together&quot; I broke down, <br/>\nthough the tears were already flowing. I want to explore that some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI gained something from every email.Pam, I loved the idea of a couple of <br/>\nactivities for every day and what to expect. I&#39;ll take as many of them as <br/>\nyou can give. I&#39;ll put instant pudding on my grocery list. It will be a <br/>\nreal test for me, I&#39;m sure, but I think it&#39;s a good starting place - in <br/>\nthe bathtub.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped me a great deal to simply hear that others of you deal with a <br/>\ncontrolling nature in yourselves and that there is hope. I also appreciate <br/>\ngiving me &#39;permission&#39; to do less challenging activities and to stay out <br/>\nof their way when they are doing something that might tempt me to take <br/>\nover, or even to just sit and watch videos with them without feeling like <br/>\nwe should do more. <br/>\n<br/>\nPractically, thank you for the tips about cleaning stamps and buying extra <br/>\nstamp pads that I don&#39;t protect. Great ideas. I know 3 and 5 sound young, <br/>\nand they are, but they love this kind of stuff. People always think my <br/>\nyounger daughter is older than she is. When she was in Montessori she was <br/>\nthe youngest in the class.  During a parent-teacher conference I reminded <br/>\nthe teacher of that and she had a hard time believing it, until she <br/>\nchecked the list. I&#39;m not saying this to say that I should treat them as <br/>\nif they are older than they are but just to explain why we often end up in <br/>\nsomewhat advanced activities. Still, even so, Iike the idea of clearly <br/>\nthinking through ahead of time how things might go and how they might <br/>\nrespond to something as a 3 1/2 and a 5 year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, they are needing me now so I must stop, but I can&#39;t thank you enough <br/>\nfor your responses. My husband read them all too and was touched. I think <br/>\nhe is realizing why these lists mean as much as they do to me.<br/>\nI&#39;m going to print out this thread and keep it in my journal.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat special women you are!<br/>\nThank you.<br/>\nGayle<br/>\n<br/>\nP.s.
