So the main thing is to focus on looking for ways to do that. Something that I&#39;ve found helpful is breaking big ideas like &quot;respect&quot; down into smaller, or at least more specific (to me) ideas. So &quot;respect&quot; can mean a lot of different things. It seems like you want you kids to have a sense of bodily integrity, or personal sovereignty - they decide when they want to be touched, when they need help, when they need space. So what can you do to remind yourself of those principles? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help to start questioning yourself - why do I want my child to do this right now? What&#39;s the rush? But in order to give yourself some time to think about those questions you may need to look for ways to slow down, to build more time into your days so that you&#39;re not snatching up a child to do x because there&#39;s no time to think. Do you see what I mean? Part of making this kind of &quot;respect&quot; possible is thinking about what the needs of the day are ahead of time - become proactive, rather than reactive. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s probably the biggest &quot;skillset&quot; of unschooling, right there - learning to be proactive. A whoooooole lot of other things follow from that. If you know, for instance, that your 4yo likes to dress herself, but takes half an hour to do so, then plan your days so she has plenty of time to get dressed on her own terms. If you&#39;re racing to get things done, its awfully convenient to stuff a little one into a set of clothes and be done with it - make INconvenience a non-issue. Little kids take time. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163414916,"authorName":"Scott & Marygrace Sorensen","from":"&quot;Scott & Marygrace Sorensen&quot; &lt;sorensen@...&gt;","profile":"unity_yfm_specialist","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Respecting personal space","postDate":"1294070027","msgId":45761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzN2QwMWNiYWI1ZSQ2OTA3ZGU3MCQzYjE3OWI1MCRAanVnZ2xlMTIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlmc2ZtZSs4M2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlmc2ZtZSs4M2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45754,"nextInTopic":45762,"prevInTime":45760,"nextInTime":45762,"topicId":45752,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Dear Parent: Caring for Infants with Respect, Your Self-Confident Baby and The RIE Manual both by Magda Gerber.
