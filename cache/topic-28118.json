She worked much of her life to  <br/>\nget schools, especially kindergartens, to stop doing structured  <br/>\nlessons and, instead, set up classrooms as places kids could be free  <br/>\nto learn what and when they were ready to learn. She was one of the  <br/>\npioneers of &quot;developmentally-appropriate curriculum.&quot; Anyway, she had  <br/>\nno problem at all calling what we did a &quot;curriculum.&quot; To her, it was  <br/>\nthe very best curriculum - the ideal.

The good news is that it&#39;s not your responsibility to do so!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Personally, I find that &quot;It&#39;s the right choice for our family&quot; is all I need to say.  If they feel a need to hear &quot;more&quot; from me, then they need to first trust me as a parent, to trust that we love our children more than we could ever put into words and that of course we are doing what we deeply believe is the best thing for them.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sure, it can be helpful to share info, books, etc with them -- but only if they&#39;re open to reading that info, only if they really desire to understand your choice.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  All they really have to do is recognize your right to make any choice you believe in for your family.  For me, it helped first to establish/remind my parents (actually done years before unschooling, since the&#39;ve always questioned my parenting methods) that I am the mother of these children, and I get to make those choices; as grandparents, they need to respect my position.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  With the inlaws -- who are much more respectful people than my own parents -- it was enough to say &quot;we really feel this is the right choice for us, and we&#39;d like some time to see results.  If we reach a day when the results aren&#39;t good for the kids, or this choice isn&#39;t working for us, we&#39;ll try something else.&quot;   With them, I&#39;ve recommended books I found helpful, and shared articles, etc, only to have no one ever ask to read anything I suggest. They don&#39;t really want to know the details, they just want to know we&#39;re really convinced of what we&#39;re doing.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One book I&#39;d recommend before any other is The Book of Learning and Forgetting, by Frank Smith.  It&#39;s not really an explanation of unschooling, but rather an explication of how learning happens and why today&#39;s schools fail to teach so many kids.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, I&#39;d never open the conversation about a choice to take the kids from school with unschooling to any relative --we first told the grands we were homeschooling, and they trusted we were reasonably intelligent enough to do the right thing by our kids.  Only once they saw we weren&#39;t doing school at home, did we talk about unschooling.  My Mom heard a couple of years ago when she stayed in our home for a few months; dh&#39;s folks just heard about it last month; my Dad still has never heard the word unschooling from me.  And we&#39;ve been unschooling for almost 5 yrs now, preceded by a year of &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschooling (done in a quite lazy fashion). <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better sports nut!

Would  <br/>\nthey be willing to join? From what I saw of that group, they are really open to  <br/>\nfamily members and people that love and care. <br/>\n <br/>\nAre they willing to do reading, more than that book? John Holt reads rather  <br/>\nacademically, and may make a deeper impression upon your family. Also, any  <br/>\nchance they would go to a conference? I understand those to be The Thing for  <br/>\ntons of people. <br/>\n <br/>\nI also want to say what a clearly generous and loving soul YOU are. It&#39;s  <br/>\nclear you care and can see how much your family loves and cares about your  <br/>\nchild. Seeing that, instead of getting angry and defensive, is really wonderful  - <br/>\nand that taught me something, as I have been defensive and angry in my life  <br/>\nregarding unschooling. So thanks, very much, for your post. <br/>\n <br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nKaren <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265175986,"authorName":"mscloudlady","from":"&quot;mscloudlady&quot; &lt;cloudlady@...&gt;","profile":"mscloudlady","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"This just feels right.....","postDate":"1196437519","msgId":28118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZpcGI2Zit0YmdtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28121,"prevInTime":28117,"nextInTime":28119,"topicId":28118,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello All ~ My father and Step-Mother are very worried that my son is not getting the education he needs (my step mum says she is really scared and needs to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1926238422\">Hello All ~<br/>\n<br/>\n  My father and Step-Mother are very worried that my son is not <br/>\ngetting the education he needs (my step mum says she is really scared <br/>\nand needs to protect him from this injustice). I see she is quite <br/>\nworried - I have given her the Unschooling Handbook and tried to get <br/>\nher to research it but to no avail. I received a call from a distant <br/>\ncousin (we are having a family union on Dec 8 at her house) she is a <br/>\nprincipal at an elementary school. My son (7) was three months <br/>\npremature ( dyslexia and sensory issues still stay us) and I have <br/>\nbeen guided since he was born but after a horrid first grade <br/>\nexperience I decided there had to be a different way and I found a <br/>\nname for the truth I knew ( We are all inherent learners and if we <br/>\ntake away the limitations we will guide ourselves to the answers) - <br/>\nUnschooling. My son has gained confidence and the desire to learn <br/>\nagain but only recently and still we are having a hard time letting <br/>\ngo of &quot;classroom&quot;, &quot;homework&quot;, &quot;Teacher&quot; but we are trying and <br/>\nsucceeding. Anyway I need some help for this up coming party - It is <br/>\na challenge for me to make them understand - I get stuck with &quot;It is <br/>\nthe right thing for us to do - I haven&#39;t been so sure of anything <br/>\nbefore.&quot; Well that holds very little water as it should. I am happy <br/>\nthat they care so much about my guys and don&#39;t want to discourage <br/>\nthat but how can I convince them it will be OK? <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help, handouts and suggestions. <br/>\n <br/>\nElizabeth L</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28138,"nextTopicId":28151}}
