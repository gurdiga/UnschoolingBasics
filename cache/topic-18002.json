He has a limited diet, but sometimes, (rarely) he will willingly eat healthier choices.<br/>\n <br/>\n I would like to be able to keep table sugar, whipped cream, etc around the house, but Sam will eat them to the exclusion of all other foods.  I think I could live with all junk for a few days if he would learn to eat other things as well.  <br/>\n <br/>\n I am open to any suggestions, the family would like to be able to keep sweets around the house sometimes!  Or learn to lose everyone&#39;s sweet tooth...<br/>\n <br/>\n Thanks,<br/>\n <br/>\n Amanda <br/>\n Eli 5.5 Samuel almost 4<br/>\n <br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
