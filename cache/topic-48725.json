What sorts of things do they &quot;deem inappropriate&quot;? Work to find ways for your kids not to run into conflict. For instance, if aunt and uncle lecture them about food, make sure the kids eat before you visit and avoid visiting for mealtimes - set the stage to be able to say &quot;oh, it&#39;s okay if they eat that, they already had dinner&quot;. If aunt and uncle lecture them about courtesy, be sure to prime the kids beforehand with a reminder to be super polite on aunt and uncle&#39;s terms to minimize conflict. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut none of that prep will be very helpful if your kids feel like they&#39;re stuck visiting people they don&#39;t like.

That&#39;s the most important question.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir aunt and uncle aren&#39;t their parents. Your kids know they only have to put up with them for as long as the visit. I suspect your kids see them as annoying not crushing (as they might if the lectures came from you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf their kids were doing something wrong, wouldn&#39;t you feel it right to say something to the kids to stop them? (If not, you should!)<br/>\n<br/>\nYour approaches are different. I suspect you wouldn&#39;t want your in-laws to tell you to parent differently. (Or if they are, I suspect it makes you want to shut your ears to any suggestions.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo suggestions. Let them know you&#39;ve found that *your* kids respond better if the point is made in just a few words, that they tend to tune out lectures. Or you could tell them to send the kids to you if there&#39;s a problem. If they start in on the kids in your presence keep asking them what your kids did wrong -- like being too loud or whatever. Get them to keep it short. And then tell them you&#39;ll handle it. (Repeat until they leave you alone.) Then give your kids some ideas on how to meet whatever need they have in ways that won&#39;t be annoying to their aunt and uncle. Explain that it&#39;s just how they are. It&#39;ll be helping your kids be courteous. It might mean engaging with your kids to do something more interesting if they&#39;re bored. It might mean getting the need met later.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say since you parent very differently, your kids are better able to respond to the parenting they&#39;re used to. If they protest that your kids should listen to others, ask them to just focus on the immediate issue, and you can each focus on fixing whatever is lacking in your own kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":405216076,"authorName":"princesssmindiii","from":"&quot;princesssmindiii&quot; &lt;princesssmindiii@...&gt;","profile":"princesssmindiii","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Interfering In-laws","postDate":"1341623465","msgId":48725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp0ODJiOSs4bDhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48726,"prevInTime":48724,"nextInTime":48726,"topicId":48725,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m relatively new to this group, therefore I apologize if this topic has been covered.
