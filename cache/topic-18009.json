As","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-191643308\">Im moving to Linden,  VA to live with one of my sons and his family and I expect to homeschool my granddaughter, now 4, so Im learning all that I can.   <br/>\n  As soon as I joined this list I read the archives for 10/1 and found that a couple of you apparently live near my soon-to-be home. Joanne, Elissa Jill, hello.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Among my reasons for homeschooling is one that may surprise you: socialization. When my 3 children where in high school back in the 80s I came to the realization that they had no real idea of what life would be like after high school. They had no friends or relatives in college, beginning their careers, or setting up independent living. Their ideas were pretty much what they gleaned from TV. In their attempt to separate their identities from their father and me, they turned to their peers, who were just as ignorant as they. Little House on the Prairie was on TV then and I thought that children who attended one room school houses probably made friends of all ages. My grandmother was born in 1872, the eldest of 6 children, and was 16 when the youngest was born. All the families around her were probably the same. Humans are not born in schools and I dont think they are meant to grow up all same age, like fish. So when I hear of networks of homeschooling families I think,<br/>\n Aha! Perhaps we can create something like an extended family for the children.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Since another aim is to keep her interest in learning alive, I pretty rapidly realized that I dont want to school at home. Seeing how she likes to play, Im pretty sure she will want to play school with workbooks and shell want a folder of things to show her dad when he gets home, but that can stop anytime it stops being fun. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  At this point Im thinking of homeschooling as being like teaching a 16 yr-old to drive. You can figure kids have probably been watching whoever was driving for some time. Put them behind the wheel and let them show and tell you what they know, and then fill in the gaps of anything they failed to observe so that theyll be safe on the road. I remember the scene in the movie Starman where the alien drives for the first time, assuring the heroine that he has been studying her driving. She is appalled when he high speeds thru an intersection and asks, Dont you know what traffic lights are for? He responds, Yes. Red means stop, green means go and yellow means go very fast. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing that does bother me about unschooling is that the term is negative and doesnt express what we are for. I have another son who I expect will send his kids to public school. He and his wife are excellent parents. I feel that talking about unschooling to them could seem like a slap in the face. Some of you seem to share this concern because I read some posts in the archives about people having a hard time talking with friends without seeming to put them down.  Im struggling to come up with a positive term to describe briefly what I think Im going to be doing with my granddaughter. So far Ive come up with &#39;eclectic home learning&#39;. Are any of you bothered by &#39;unschooling&#39; being negative rather than affirmative? If so, how do you handle it?<br/>\n <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Alice Roddy<br/>\n  <br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
