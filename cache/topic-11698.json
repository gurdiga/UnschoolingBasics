I have times when I am busy ---seems like <br/>\n*every* minute is planned and crammed and that there are not nearly <br/>\nenough hours in a day. THEN things slow down for me: I think about what <br/>\nI&#39;ve done. I make plans for future projects. I daydream a lot. I piddle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the older I get, the fewer &quot;down&quot; times I seem to have because I <br/>\nhave so many projects in the works---but I still need some quiet, <br/>\ncontemplative time after a flurry of activity.

They take a short break (during which they play <br/>\nno music), and then go back and discover they&#39;ve made that connection <br/>\nthey&#39;ve been looking for. When Duncan (10) struggles with a game, I&#39;ll <br/>\noften suggest he take a small break from *that* game and bounce or swim <br/>\nor take a walk. Maybe that short break is all he needs. But maybe he <br/>\nneeds a week or so off to digest how&#39; he&#39;s gotten *this* far. When he&#39;s <br/>\nback to that game, he often beats it immediately---or at least finds <br/>\nthe hole he&#39;s missing.

NOTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept doing things with his brother and kept offering that he join us. <br/>\nSlowly, he started joining us, but it took *forever*! Well, it *seemed* <br/>\nlike forever! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nEighteen months before he did anything that resembled &quot;human&quot;---by two <br/>\nyears, he was rediscovering all sorts of things---skateboarding, <br/>\nfilm-making, drumming, working, driving, etc. Now, six years later, <br/>\nthere are not enough hours in each day for all he has going on. That&#39;s <br/>\nreally cool, but that didn&#39;t help me at the time! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more you nag and wish that they are doing more, the longer it will <br/>\n*feel* like they aren&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe patient. Be respectful. Be generous. Be kind. Be trusting. Be <br/>\naccepting of who they are at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet involved *yourself* with some new hobby. Be interested. Be <br/>\ninteresting. Think about something else---ANYthing else! &lt;g&gt; The time <br/>\nwill go faster if you aren&#39;t worrying to death about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatience. Patience.

(This <br/>\npast September) He has five children, and I have two.  We now also <br/>\nhave almost three, Tab was due to deliver today, grandchildren.  :)  <br/>\nOur four oldest went all the way through PS from K-12.  One just <br/>\ngraduated Dorsey Schools in Administration.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI stared relaxed-homeschooling my son, Adrian, at the age of 9.  I <br/>\nstarted out from the beginning homeschooling him then put him in a <br/>\ncharter school thinking that it was the right thing for K-3.5 <br/>\npulling him out Christmas break.  We kept all the others in school.  <br/>\nThe four older girls having gone so far through the system we <br/>\nthought it best to leave them...hind sight IS 20/20.  Amie, 16, came <br/>\nhome for unschooling at Christmas break this school year.  Andrew, <br/>\n14, is coming home at Spring break.  Adrian and I have been <br/>\nofficially unschooling for about 2 years now.  We absolutely LOVE it <br/>\nand wouldn&#39;t change it for the world.  The three youngest are our <br/>\nonly school age children.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that Amie and Andrew are coming home to unschool things are more <br/>\ncomplicated.  They are &quot;his&quot; children biologially speaking.  We have <br/>\nraised them together most of their lives.  They know and respect me <br/>\nas mom, and I respect them as my children, or we wouldn&#39;t be where <br/>\nwe are with school.  It seems a different road traveled to be <br/>\nstarting this late in the game, and I&#39;ve not found much, printed <br/>\nmaterial wise, on coming to unschooling late at an older age.  I am <br/>\na voracious reader and have soaked in plenty of information to keep <br/>\nme pointed forward, not to say that I never get a twinge of fear <br/>\nhere and there, but I do try to keep it in check.  I have a great <br/>\ncapacity to trust, and that is really working for me with the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat on the other hand is a high-school drop out, so he looks at <br/>\neducation A LOT differently than I do.  Never mind his amazing <br/>\nsuccesses throughout life.  I try to share with him what I&#39;ve <br/>\nlearned, but it&#39;s just not the same as knowing it in your heart.  I <br/>\ntry to point out that he gained knowledge and success on his own <br/>\ndespite the school system.  They are not the ones that taught him to <br/>\nget to where his is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday he stated, &quot;There are some things that I just want them to <br/>\nlearn.&quot;  This comment came about after Tab, our oldest, shared that <br/>\nAdrian, the 12-year-old, had difficulty remembering how to write the <br/>\nletter 8 the &quot;fancy&quot; way...not like a snow man but rather one <br/>\ncontinuous line.  Adrian&#39;s writing is a consistent concern for Pat.  <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t like to write, so he doesn&#39;t do much of it, and Pat does <br/>\nnotice.  Anyway, I tried to ease his fears by reminding him that <br/>\nsituations like that are perfectly normal.  Kids all learn <br/>\ndifferently.  It&#39;s based on how often you need to do something.  ie: <br/>\nThe more you do it the better you get at it and the more you <br/>\nunderstand and know it.  &quot;What about stuff like times tables?&quot;  My <br/>\nresponse was to state that they do know multiplication it just <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t look the way he thinks it should based on our school minded <br/>\nself...I didn&#39;t word it that way, but that was the point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn&#39;t really persist, but I&#39;m not really sure if he&#39;s <br/>\nunderstanding me.  I&#39;m not sure how to help him understand.  Some <br/>\nideas I&#39;ve had to ease his fears is to keep an Unschooling Record <br/>\nBook.  I started that this week.  Then, when he asks me things I can <br/>\nshare what I&#39;ve recorded...I tend not to keep that information fresh <br/>\nand ready at the front of my brain.  I just trust they&#39;re learning <br/>\nall the time.  It&#39;s also been suggested to do occasional conferences <br/>\nwith him to keep him up to speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother situation that&#39;s been tough, especially having three teenage <br/>\ndaughters give birth unexpectedly and unmarried, is trusting with <br/>\nAmie, the new to unschooling 16-year-old.  She&#39;s spending A LOT of <br/>\ntime talking with a boy a few years her senior and not the best <br/>\nreputation.  He has a girl pregnant, drinks, smokes and swears a <br/>\nmean streak.  To add to it she&#39;s never introduced him to us.  Amie <br/>\nseems level headed, but this is tough for Pat.  Amie is the <br/>\nmost &quot;16&quot; 16-year-old I have ever known.  How do I honor both of <br/>\nthem?  Meaning, how do I trust her and respect him at the same <br/>\ntime?  It&#39;s tough.  I have done things like encourage them to play <br/>\nbasketball at our house and hang out our front yard when they chat.  <br/>\nIt seems to be cool so far.  Just a sensitive spot, especially for a <br/>\nprotective father.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions on how to be okay with the not-really-doing-anything <br/>\nphase when your child is new to the game at an older age, <br/>\nexperiences with deschooling after such a long time in school and <br/>\neasing the uncertain parents fears would be MUCH appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys - Tina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11725,"nextTopicId":11530}}
