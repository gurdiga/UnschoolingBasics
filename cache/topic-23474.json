When he was<br/>\nyounger, 6.5 or seven I would occasionally try to &quot;Teach&quot; him to read.<br/>\nHe would hide in his t-shirt, roll on the floor squealing or<br/>\ncrying,bang himself on the head and eventually crawl out of the room<br/>\nleaving me frazzled and close to tears. He most likely would have had<br/>\na diagnosis of ADD or something.<br/>\nHe used to say he wouldn&#39;t read until he could read Lord Of The Rings!<br/>\n I would tell people that and I think they thought I was mad to think<br/>\nthat might happen on its own. He announced four mnths before his<br/>\neighth birthday that he thinks he will read by his next birthday.And<br/>\nhe did!His first book was &quot;God Bless The Gargoyles&quot; by Dav Pilkey,then<br/>\na few Beverley Cleary Books and then a large volume, Arthur, High King<br/>\nOf Britain, followed by Gawain andthe Loathly Lady,Sir Percival and<br/>\nany other Arthur stuff he could find. Then The Hobbit and the Lord Of<br/>\nThe Rings, The Fellowship of the Rings.For him, mission accomplished<br/>\nand all within nine months of beginning to read. He has now read the<br/>\nfirst five Harry Potter books and carries a book around most of the<br/>\ntime. He also plays lots of computer games playstation, tree climbing,<br/>\nand other stuff.He just turned nine.<br/>\nOur homeschool consultant, an unschooler told me her son didnt read<br/>\ntill 11 or 12. Then he started to read National Geographic cover to<br/>\ncover and scientific mags too.<br/>\nIf he doesnt want top go to camp dont push it. If you can mention to<br/>\nthe facilitator that he doesnt read that might work, or choose a camp<br/>\nthat is not likely to involve reading.<br/>\nAnd a good thing to let people know is that after a very short time<br/>\nyou cant tell the difference between a child who read at four or a<br/>\nchild who read at ten yo.<br/>\nIt is worth the wait! What is the point in a boy who is taught to read<br/>\nat five in school because he &quot;has to&quot; but totally loses the love of<br/>\nreading which so often happens when learning is pushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: socialization cartoon","postDate":"1177935447","msgId":23504,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxNG1vbitsY3NpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYxM25hYytjODFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23503,"nextInTopic":23507,"prevInTime":23503,"nextInTime":23505,"topicId":23474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey thanks! :-) ~ Joanne ~ Add your voice ~ Unschooling Voices http://tinyurl.com/26pt6x","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1560687423\">Hey thanks! :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nAdd your voice ~ Unschooling Voices<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/26pt6x\">http://tinyurl.com/26pt6x</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; <br/>\n&lt;gehrkes@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Joanne&quot; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;billyandjoanne@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2007/04/socialization-\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2007/04/socialization-</a><br/>\n&gt; cartoon.html<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joanne,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just spent a delightful hour in your sight.

Diffrent subject but still same fear! <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Only advice I can give with regards to reading is, if he doesn&#39;t want to read, then YOU read to him as often as he allows you to, meaning he must be enjoy it! No forcing as it can be rather painful being forced to still thru something you both don&#39;t like. My son being read to and still do. Us reading to him, I believe, is instrumental to his high capabililty of being able to read anything today. He started reading to himself when he was 4. Today he&#39;s 6 going 7, and he could very easily read anything he picks up but this doesn&#39;t meant he can understand what he&#39;s reading! And even though he can read, he still prefers being read to, everynight at bedtime! And sometimes we go thru 3,4 or even 5 or 6 short stories but there are days when we know he&#39;s tired because he could barely keep his eyes open, halfway thru the first story LOL! We read anything he picks up from the library, from big train encyclopedia to baby storybooks. And it&#39;s because he &#39;knows&#39; he&#39;ll gain access to<br/>\n any story, thru us reading to him, he&#39;ll just about pick up anything he like the look of, on the cover and bring it home with us. So it&#39;s very normal of me lugging this hug shopping bag of thick books of which we&#39;ll probably end up only reading the first 2 pages!

I can&#39;t prove that they are wrong and maybe<br/>\ndeep down I wonder if they are right.  The only thing<br/>\nthat keeps me going is that I love this lifestyle and<br/>\nthat my kids are happier emotionally than when they<br/>\nwere in school.  I think my in-laws think that I am<br/>\nselfish for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh well, I&#39;ve said enough.  I would love to hear how<br/>\nyou all have dealt with fears, in-laws and late<br/>\nreaders!  Forging new ground means you don&#39;t have a<br/>\nwhole lot of models around to emulate.  I have read<br/>\njust about every unschooling book there is and have 2<br/>\nsubscriptions to unschooling magazines. Oh and I have<br/>\nread a lot online too about late readers and fears<br/>\n(Sandra Dodd&#39;s page about reading being one).<br/>\nThanks a lot,<br/>\nAnne  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
