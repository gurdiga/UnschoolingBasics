It can often be shocking how sensible our words feel to us but how totally different they come across to our kids.&gt; it can all be a positive unschooling experience because our whole &gt; family feels the same way about food.Then what&#39;s to discuss if everyone in the family feels the same?&gt; There are ways to approach the whole thing respectfully and &gt; informationally and I would hope people could feel comfortable &gt; sharing how they successfully do that without being told they are &gt; &quot;wrong&quot; or their beliefs are &quot;rubbish&quot;.If your kids believe as you do, then there&#39;s nothing to discuss.If your kids have beliefs that are different than yours, and you&#39;re asking how to smoothly insure the family adheres to your beliefs, that&#39;s counter to the principles of the list.If your kids have beliefs that are different than yours, how do you want them to approach you when they think you&#39;re wrong? How far would you want them to go in insisting that you follow their beliefs and give up your own?&gt; I wouldn&#39;t condone shaming or manipulating either but eating &gt; healthily doesn&#39;t always equate to that.If you&#39;re offering and the kids are saying &quot;Great!&quot;, then what&#39;s to discuss?How do you handle it when the kids want something other than what you want them to have?The answer for this list is to treat their want as seriously as you treat a want of your own (that doesn&#39;t involve imposing on others.) How do you treat yourself or your husband who wants something? You help them get it.What if they want something you feel is dangerous? Let&#39;s say a full size ATV. The answer would be to help them find some way to get the experience they want. Maybe there&#39;s something smaller. Maybe there&#39;s someone who would help them ride. With something that far out of my experience, I&#39;d ask on the list for ideas!If my child wanted Oreos, and I was into whole foods, I&#39;d explore the whole food options. Depending on the child and what she really wanted, we might do a taste test with brand name Oreos. I&#39;d talk about the ingredients in an informational way, saying &quot;These are the ingredients that make me prefer to buy organic,&quot; and I&#39;d talk about why. It would *not* be presented with the idea in the back of my mind, &quot;And that&#39;s why you should make the same choice.&quot; It&#39;s just information to help her choose. If the child decided Oreos were what she wanted, I&#39;d buy Oreos.I found it very helpful to show my daughter the ingredients on packages *I* was pondering over rather than on things she wanted. I pointed out the number of unpronounceable ingredients as the first step. And we&#39;ve added to the discussion since; she knows the difference between unpronounceable vitamins and weird chemicals. ;-)Kids are pretty savvy! They know the difference between when we&#39;re trying to get them to believe as we do and when we&#39;re trusting that they&#39;re intelligent enough to use information to help them make decisions. They *won&#39;t* at the beginning, make the same decisions we do. The important part isn&#39;t to parrot the adults&#39; knowledge and do what the parent would do. The important part is to think and decide and reassess. It&#39;s a process. A child who knows they&#39;re free to have Oreos in an organic home is much more likely to embrace an organic lifestyle later in life than one who feels they must not have Oreos for various dire reasons.Joyce [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Eating meat","postDate":"1214584153","msgId":34197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY4RTUwODUyLTI0OUYtNDhFOS1CQjFCLTQ1MkYxQjJBRjk2OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XNTBEMDJCNkFFQ0NBOTJFMTdDRjhGQkFEQTIwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XNEZCMERFQjk4NUI3NDJFRkJGQjUwQURBMjBAcGh4LmdibD4gPGc0MzI0NitpMzNlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkFZMTEyLVc1MEQwMkI2QUVDQ0E5MkUxN0NGOEZCQURBMjBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":34196,"nextInTopic":34198,"prevInTime":34196,"nextInTime":34198,"topicId":34123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I just don&#39;t agree with stocking the house with food that I believe to be unhealthy just so my children have the choice to eat that food (if they never would have known about the food before I brought it into the house). Or if my child says he wants doritos, I might say &quot;would you consider this or this instead&quot; and let him choose without judgement. I would consider this informing instead of manipulating or restricting. I think that a lot of what our children are exposed to is because of us. As they get older they do have the increasing ability to make choices for themselves but initially we are the people exposing them to the possibilities. We can lay the initial groundwork and then they have the freedom to accept or deny. I personally think (and studies support this) that children are more likely to have health problems if the initial environment is unhealthy or the parents model an unhealthy lifestyle. Yet I also think that if you are overly restrictive or shaming in anyway, that it tends to &quot;backfire&quot; too.

This is unfortunate for the world if there  <br/>\n&gt; is, after all, truth to his claims--as reproduction of his results  <br/>\n&gt; by any scientist would lend much credence to his work. A little  <br/>\n&gt; change in Emoto’s experimental design would do great things for the  <br/>\n&gt; credibility of his claims. I recommend the following to ground his  <br/>\n&gt; work in sound scientific principle:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    * Eliminate the possibility of the scientist’s bias affecting  <br/>\n&gt; the experiment’s results by implementing double blind procedures.<br/>\n&gt;    * Publish the entire collection of photos for all water sample  <br/>\n&gt; tests that he has performed, not just the ones that support his claim.<br/>\n&gt;    * Minimize the sources of possible error in his procedures, such  <br/>\n&gt; as variation in temperature and humidity between sample.<br/>\n&gt;    * Pay more attention to the time-tested methods of the  <br/>\n&gt; scientific community rather than disregarding them. Emoto’s  <br/>\n&gt; research could go much farther if he could interest scientists  <br/>\n&gt; around the world in testing his hypothesis.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; After the lengthy review of Emoto’s research methods and results, I  <br/>\n&gt; have come to believe that Dr. Emoto is offering pseudoscience to  <br/>\n&gt; the masses in the guise of defensible research. Only time and  <br/>\n&gt; review by others will tell if there is any truth at the heart of  <br/>\n&gt; Mr. Emoto’s claims, as Emoto himself thoroughly believes in his  <br/>\n&gt; findings but does not value the scientific method or community.  <br/>\n&gt; What is truly fearsome is the great numbers of people that accept  <br/>\n&gt; his words as proven facts without looking deeper to find out if his  <br/>\n&gt; claims are truly justified. While I respect Dr. Emoto’s desire to  <br/>\n&gt; save the Earth’s water from contamination and pollution, unless he  <br/>\n&gt; can produce a scientific paper and get it published in a scientific  <br/>\n&gt; journal, I believe that he will continue to be ignored by the  <br/>\n&gt; scientific community, and his claims will never be soundly proved  <br/>\n&gt; or disproved&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327608745,"authorName":"ann329851","from":"&quot;ann329851&quot; &lt;annworsley991@...&gt;","profile":"ann329851","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Eating meat","postDate":"1214555319","msgId":34175,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc0MjhibittNjVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDgwNjI2MTcwNWgzYmJmYWY5MnM5NjY2MTEzYmE1OWEyMWVmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34174,"nextInTopic":34183,"prevInTime":34174,"nextInTime":34176,"topicId":34123,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wouldn t ...

Price Foundation is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charity <br/>\nfounded in 1999 to disseminate the research of nutrition pioneer Dr. <br/>\nWeston Price, whose studies of isolated nonindustrialized peoples <br/>\nestablished the parameters of human health and determined the optimum <br/>\ncharacteristics of human diets. Dr. Price&#39;s research demonstrated <br/>\nthat humans achieve perfect physical form and perfect health <br/>\ngeneration after generation only when they consume nutrient-dense <br/>\nwhole foods and the vital fat-soluble activators found exclusively in <br/>\nanimal fats. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Foundation is dedicated to restoring nutrient-dense foods to the <br/>\nhuman diet through education, research and activism. It supports a <br/>\nnumber of movements that contribute to this objective including <br/>\naccurate nutrition instruction, organic and biodynamic farming, <br/>\npasture-feeding of livestock, community-supported farms, honest and <br/>\ninformative labeling, prepared parenting and nurturing therapies. <br/>\nSpecific goals include establishment of universal access to clean, <br/>\ncertified raw milk and a ban on the use of soy formula for infants.<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom westonaprice.org<br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not my intention to further fuel the veg/non-veg diet debate so <br/>\nmuch, but to show that highly educated people are found on all sides <br/>\nof debates like this, and I&#39;m grounded in no less informed or <br/>\nscientific research than anyone else. *And* I understand that others&#39; <br/>\npaths have lead them elsewhere and are in a place that&#39;s right for <br/>\nthem for a variety of reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to be a woman of My Beliefs. One byproduct of unschooling for <br/>\nme has been a release from belief into celebrating the exciting but <br/>\nuncertain place of I Don&#39;t Know...anything really...and certainly not <br/>\nfor anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still think the Price philosophy resonates with me the most and <br/>\nmakes the most sense to me intuitively and scientifically- I mean the <br/>\nman studied tribal populations all over the world and looked at what <br/>\nwas eaten by those who enjoyed vibrant health and literally none of <br/>\nthe chronic disease that afflict the west. And it feels good to me <br/>\nand my body eating clean, pastured meats and dairy, organic, local <br/>\nveggies, etc. I can say since eating this way I am healthier in <br/>\ndefinite, measurable ways and more energetic now in my 30s than I <br/>\nrecall even as a child or teen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut while I used to believe it was 100% nutritional therapy that <br/>\ncured me, I wonder now how much it really came from the empowerment <br/>\nof saying no to the medical/disease model and believing in the <br/>\npotential of my body to heal &quot;just&quot; from food. Every day I grow more <br/>\nconvinced of the power of our thoughts to determine our health and, <br/>\nwell, everything in our lives. It&#39;s why Joy is now the ultimate <br/>\nmeasure of success and effectiveness for everything in my life. Now I <br/>\nwonder if it&#39;s *ever* really about the food.

And it is on this very topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n Melissa,  I hope you can forgive those of us who don&#39;t wish to put meat in<br/>\nour bodies.  Actually, most vegetation is broken down before it gets to the<br/>\nfull blown rotting stage since our bodies produce enzymes that break it down<br/>\nquickly.  If raw veggies are eaten, then one has the added benefit (and<br/>\nspeed of digestion) of the enzymes in the veggies themselves that help break<br/>\nit down to liquid form...so we can get the nutrients.  However in the 3 days<br/>\nthat meat takes to liquefy, it has produced toxins as well as the nutrients<br/>\nthat we can absorb.  Our bodies have to work harder to get the nutrients<br/>\n(since enzymes are destroyed at 118 degrees) and eliminate the toxins.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true, many bodies can handle this.  It is also true that many can not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMine can not.  But it took 35 years for the build-up to cause a major<br/>\ndisease.  And only 4 to help heal itself when given everything it needed to<br/>\nheal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to go raw because my body was attacking itself...and food was a<br/>\nburden.  It is harder to digest animal products and I couldn&#39;t afford to<br/>\nhave my energy placed there when it needed to cleanse out all the stuff that<br/>\nwas being stored in my body.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had RSD.  A nerve disorder.  It&#39;s no joke.  I have managed to &#39;cure&#39;<br/>\nmyself (I have been pain free since January 16th) by going raw and cleansing<br/>\nmy body.  The conventional way of treating RSD is steroids and nerve<br/>\nblockers.  I chose alternative treatments (because I didn&#39;t like those<br/>\noptions) and food was one alternative treatment that came up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wont go back to eating everything.  I may cook more of my food<br/>\nagain...someday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wouldn&#39;t expect anyone else to eat the way I do.

Your body may not.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an interesting side note.  All our body cells are replaced<br/>\n(everything in our body - bones and all) every 2 or so years.  So why do we<br/>\nhave chronic disease or allergies?  It would be only part of the equation to<br/>\nthink the environment is the issue.  It would also be only part of the<br/>\nequation to say that genetics is the issue.  And it would also be only part<br/>\nof the equation to say food is the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this being said...I still have one child who eats a great well balanced<br/>\ndiet and one who eats literally 6 things with little if any meat, much<br/>\ndairy, no fruit and no vegetables and plenty of starches.  Both boys are<br/>\ngrowing strong and healthy.
