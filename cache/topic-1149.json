A friend? A website? Surfing?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you coming to unschooling from attachment parenting----like Robyn <br/>\nand  <br/>\nRue and Deb? Or are you coming into it from a schooling background, <br/>\nlike me<br/>\nand <br/>\nPam and Ren?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you looking at unschooling as a means of &quot;education&quot; only? Or do <br/>\nyou  <br/>\nfind it emcompassing your lives? Do you want to limit it to educational<br/>\nthings?  <br/>\nOr do you want it as a lifestyle?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nI was referred by another list, AlwaysLearning.  Sandra put it out there and I came over and am so glad I did.   I&#39;m coming from AP.  Well, I guess I thought it was about education only...but now I know that life is the education and that it is a whole attitude that I am incorporating into every area of our lives.
