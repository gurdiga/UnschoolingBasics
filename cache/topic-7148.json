We are in California and we decided to try signing Jaiden (7yrs ds) up in a charter school this year. He is a child who craves structure and order (always has). He has made scheduals for himselfs amd posted them all over the house :).<br/>\n <br/>\nI feel a little strange unschooling and being in a charter school, but Jaiden seems to be much happier now. Thats what matters right? <br/>\n <br/>\nAvery (4yrs ds) is all excited about getting signed up in the charter next year, but I worry a little more about that, he&#39;ll be 5 and I think he should just be, but his big brother in in charter school so he HAS to be in it too. Avery is also a very different personality than Jaiden he doesn&#39;t like structure at all. I guess we&#39;ll burn that bridge when we get to it :).<br/>\n <br/>\nHmmm, this is all very rambly and disconected my coffee is still trying to work it&#39;s way to my brain.

I wanted <br/>\n  to update you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  First, it seems like we&#39;re going to be getting a bit larger. I just <br/>\n  discovered that I am pregnant, a total surprise. This would not have <br/>\n  been the time I would have planned a new baby, but somehow with <br/>\n  everything else, I feel remarkably calm (and happy) about it. I was <br/>\n  worried that the kids would be worried or upset, but they are all <br/>\n  very happy. Becca, who is 9, said &quot;We&#39;ve all had such a sad time. <br/>\n  It&#39;s good to have something wonderful to look forward to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I had read your sweet responses to the older kids, who didn&#39;t say <br/>\n  much. The next day they ALL came to Dan and me. Emma told us that <br/>\n  they had all agreed that if one of us were willing to be home with <br/>\n  them they would like to unschool. Sophie, who is 13, a Virgo, and <br/>\n  VERY serious said, &quot;Look this whole thing is going to look like the <br/>\n  Waltons, especially with a new baby. We&#39;re going to go crazy without <br/>\n  some structure, and we all have to pitch in. We&#39;re a weird family, <br/>\n  but we ARE a family.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  At that point I started to cry (Dan, too), and said I&#39;d be happy to <br/>\n  be home with them. Annie, who is 10, and another Virgo, wants to make <br/>\n  up charts to keep us organized. I thought that might be overdoing it. <br/>\n  She said, pointing to me and Dan, &quot;Your main jobs are to love us and <br/>\n  to keep telling stories about our parents so the little ones don&#39;t <br/>\n  forget them.&quot; As you would imagine, we cried for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I have let my employers I will not be returning. (Dan and I have <br/>\n  been on a leave of absence.) Dan goes back to work November 1.
