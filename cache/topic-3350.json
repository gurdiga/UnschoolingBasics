To reference my thoughts, here is part of Kelly&#39;s writing:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are NOT taught in any grade, Middle or HIgh School *!* know of. But I wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons and dog obedience classes, They paid for dog and horse shows and equipment..........&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now Kelly, as a child, was &quot;bold&quot; (bold may not be the proper  nference here!) enough to ask, mention or suggest to her parents , her interests. and they responded. But what if you have a child ( maybe a really shy one in the family)  who may not want to &quot;bother &quot; his parents with his needs (maybe really feel not worthy to deserve them) or just afraid to ask, for feeling that he may be rejected,,,,,, Some kids are truly gifted to be frugal and may not see the need or feel the need to buy things for just themselves. They may be thinking that spending the money on themselves is/would be a waste of money. <br/>\n  How do you go about telling a child that it is OK to think about their personal wants as not being selfish, self-centered or such.?

I do <br/>\nthat every day. Most of our $$ right now goes  towards &quot;education&quot;---and since <br/>\nour &quot;educational plan&quot; involves finding  their passions, well....it&#39;s pretty <br/>\neasy to do that! &lt;G&gt; And  to justify it! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nDoes he have NO passions? Hell, I&#39;d just BUY it---whether he thinks he&#39;s  <br/>\nworth it or not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":5844842,"authorName":"Colleen in GA","from":"Colleen in GA &lt;technomom4@...&gt;","profile":"technomom4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"kids asking for things","postDate":"1096477127","msgId":3350,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTI5MTY1ODQ4LjI3NjkwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjExNTAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTYzNzI2MDguMzg1Ljc1MjQubTEyQHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3351,"prevInTime":3349,"nextInTime":3351,"topicId":3350,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Dear Readers: for those of you that attended the recent Live and Learn Conf,  I am referring to Kelly Lovejoy s article in our attendee s binder entitled:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1188068739\">Hey Dear Readers: <br/>\nfor those of you that attended the recent Live and Learn Conf,  I am referring to Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s article in our attendee&#39;s binder entitled: &quot;The Three Stages of Unschooling&quot; Stage 1. To reference my thoughts, here is part of Kelly&#39;s writing:<br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;Two of my passions as a child were dogs and horses. Dogs and horses are NOT taught in any grade, Middle or HIgh School *!* know of. But I wanted to learn everything I could about them. My parents gave me dogs and horses. They bought me books and paid for me to take riding lessons and dog obedience classes, They paid for dog and horse shows and equipment..........&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nNow Kelly, as a child, was &quot;bold&quot; (bold may not be the proper  nference here!) enough to ask, mention or suggest to her parents , her interests. and they responded. But what if you have a child ( maybe a really shy one in the family)  who may not want to &quot;bother &quot; his parents with his needs (maybe really feel not worthy to deserve them) or just afraid to ask, for feeling that he may be rejected,,,,,, Some kids are truly gifted to be frugal and may not see the need or feel the need to buy things for just themselves. They may be thinking that spending the money on themselves is/would be a waste of money. <br/>\nHow do you go about telling a child that it is OK to think about their personal wants as not being selfish, self-centered or such.? And let the child to gradually see that their wants are important too! <br/>\nColleen in GA<br/>\nPS maybe Kelly was raised as an only child !!<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
