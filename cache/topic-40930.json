Don&#39;t worry about reading. That&#39;s not going to be hurt by waiting, but it may be set back by more intervention. If the problem *is* degenerative, look into what the therapy actually is - it may be something yall can do at home, or that she can do, herself, more casually. Don&#39;t rush into anything! Give her time to consider the various options *and* more time to deschool. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":334709176,"authorName":"Susan Burgess","from":"Susan Burgess &lt;susands@...&gt;","profile":"susandsb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Reading - Vision problems?","postDate":"1249573909","msgId":40930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxZTA4YTY2MDkwODA2MDg1MWg3OWEzNGU0MHhmYmJjOWNiZTk0ZWJlOWU4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":40941,"prevInTime":40929,"nextInTime":40931,"topicId":40930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My youngest, who is now 11, is not a fluent reader yet.

She was in public<br/>\nschool thru 2nd grade, and was labeled dyslexic while she was there. The<br/>\nreading assignments and homework were a huge stress on her. Even once we<br/>\ntook her out of school, until we started unschooling this past year, we<br/>\ntried to help her read, although at a much more mellow level, but I wish we<br/>\nhadn&#39;t, it was like we were constantly saying that there is something wrong<br/>\nwith her that we had to fix, which I hate that we did to her. Now, after<br/>\nbeing let be this past year,  she will occasionally pick up a simple book<br/>\nthat we have read aloud many times, for enjoyment, occasionally asking me<br/>\nwhat a word or a few words say. Most things, on the computer or tv, we just<br/>\nread for her.  But, just yesterday, she went in for an annual eye exam, and<br/>\nand doc was of course asking her about reading, Holly told her that it<br/>\nstressed her out so she didn&#39;t do it much. The doc did find that she needed<br/>\nreading glasses and also recommended Vision Therapy for her. Has anyone gone<br/>\nthru that? The last thing I want to do is to get her more help to fix her<br/>\n&quot;problem&quot;. But, as I was looking into it a bit on the computer yesterday, it<br/>\nshowed a picture of how some people with vision problems see words, it<br/>\nshowed one with the words and sentences chopped up into small pieces and she<br/>\nsaid &quot;yea, that&#39;s kind of what I see&quot;. I am torn about this. I want to<br/>\ncontinue giving her the space to come to reading at her own pace, and I<br/>\ndeeply do not want to make her again feel that there is something wrong with<br/>\nher. But, would I also doing her a disservice by ignoring vision problems<br/>\nthat could be causing problems for her? When we briefly talked about it<br/>\nafter the doc, she did not want the therapy at all. I think she had visions<br/>\nof more people trying to force her to learn what she didn&#39;t want to learn,<br/>\nher self-confidence suffered so much earlier dealing with all this, I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to screw up what she&#39;s been gaining with the unschooling and letting<br/>\nher be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Aug 6, 2009 at 5:55 AM, Meredith &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:meredith@...\">meredith@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&lt;unschoolingbasics%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Betj&quot; &lt;bkind28@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; My son and I both test &quot;gifted&quot; and struggled to read.
