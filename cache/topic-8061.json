I tried deschooling <br/>\nlast year but went back to &quot;the schedule&quot; when I felt our day was too <br/>\nunstructured.

My 7 yo son was the catalyst <br/>\nin this revelation, as he had become increasingly unhappy and <br/>\ndisinterested in his schoolwork.  My girls (especially the 12 yo) are <br/>\nwhat you might deem the &quot;studious&quot; type, so they didn&#39;t complain much.  <br/>\nStill, I knew in my heart something had to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the past few months we threw caution (and curricula :) to the <br/>\nwind and just started living life.  We are enjoying and appreciating <br/>\none another so much more now....I sure wish I&#39;d started sooner.
