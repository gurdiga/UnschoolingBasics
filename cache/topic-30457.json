Perhaps it would have been more<br/>\naccurate to state that the primary reason why the government ended<br/>\nslavery had more to do with economics than anything else.  This doesn&#39;t<br/>\nnegate the wonderful, and often times, selfless work of the<br/>\nabolitionists.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAs for social conscience, I&#39;d argue that while the social conscience of<br/>\nthe abolitionists was that owning a fellow human was inherently wrong,<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t necessarily that of most people in the country at the time.<br/>\nThe abolitionists would argue that all rational human beings must have<br/>\nknown deep down that slavery was wrong, and were trying to reach that.<br/>\nPerhaps they were right, making the argument that it was the social<br/>\nconscience of most that simply needed awakening through their efforts?  <br/>\n <br/>\nI certainly wouldn&#39;t consider the abolitionists&#39; work for nothing, but<br/>\nkeep in mind even history is debatable, and different people interpret<br/>\nhistory differently.  There are people, for example, who argue the<br/>\nHolocaust never happened.  I find that ridiculously insane.  On the note<br/>\nof the debatability of history, I disclaim that the preceding is my<br/>\ninterpretation of a piece of history:o).<br/>\n <br/>\nCristina<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Deb Lewis<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 03, 2008 10:29 PM<br/>\nTo: LIST<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: HSers mandated to put kids in school<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***I don&#39;t know if many people know this, but social conscience had<br/>\nnothing<br/>\nto do with the abolition of slavery.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe abolitionists would disagree that social conscience had &quot;nothing&quot; to<br/>\ndo with the end of slavery in America.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\nThomas Paine wrote his famous article in 1775.
