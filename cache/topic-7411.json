That is just<br/>\ntoo cool, Ren.  Also, your story helped show a<br/>\npositive (from someone that I actually KNOW) for video<br/>\ngames.  German?  Too awesome...maybe this year he&#39;ll<br/>\nsing &quot;O&#39; Tannenbaum&quot; instead of &quot;O&#39; Christmas<br/>\nTree&quot;..LOL  Or perhaps singing isn&#39;t his cup o&#39; tea?<br/>\n;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Learning,<br/>\n~Sandy<br/>\nwww.360.yahoo.com/aplan4life<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________ <br/>\nYahoo!

We trust that if<br/>\nit is important to the learner, then it&#39;s IMPORTANT.<br/>\nEven if it&#39;s something distasteful to us personally.<br/>\nI was a bit on edge about my boys loving GTA and some of the other<br/>\nviolent video games they love...but I trusted that it was something<br/>\nimportant to THEM.<br/>\nGUess what?<br/>\nTrevor is learning German now, an interest sparked by a violent game<br/>\ncalled &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; he plays often. He&#39;s made rich and deep<br/>\nfriendships, written wonderfully and in a detailed manner about these<br/>\ngames and why they&#39;re good, bad or ugly, learned technical stuff I<br/>\ncan&#39;t even begin to explain and gained some incredible consumer skills<br/>\nthrough it all.<br/>\nIt&#39;s important to HIM.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, his video card started acting up. It causes a black screen<br/>\nand the appearance that your computer is completely dead. He had<br/>\nfigured out the glitch and repaired it in the past...in fact, he made<br/>\nthis same repair for a good friend after they were ready to wipe the<br/>\nentire memory out. Even the techs they called didn&#39;t know how to fix<br/>\nit and Trevor managed to do it in five minutes!<br/>\nBut I digress...<br/>\nAnyway, he was extremely frustrated about the video card crashing.<br/>\nThis was exascerbated by the fact that he couldn&#39;t find the cable to<br/>\nmake the repair...it was gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow a traditional family might have said &quot;good, now he&#39;ll do something<br/>\nbesides be on that damn computer all the time&quot; or &quot;suck it up kid,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll get the parts later.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as unschoolers, we know this stuff is IMPORTANT, because we trust<br/>\nthe learner and the experience they choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo....Markus checked Best Buy during some errands, no luck. We called<br/>\naround and found the parts at Radio Shack. Our entire family loads up<br/>\nto go get this special cable, but unfortunately it was a lot more than<br/>\nwe thought it would cost.<br/>\nWe try a couple more places, no luck.<br/>\nSales people give him advice that he knows is incorrect, he&#39;s more<br/>\npissed now.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon reaching home, Markus and Trevor start digging around and locate<br/>\na damaged S-video cable...one of the parts needed. They rip it open,<br/>\nattach two of the wires to an RCA cable, muck about for 10 minutes and<br/>\nmanage to fix the video card.<br/>\n<br/>\nHA!!<br/>\nSo by trusting the learner, by validating his frustration and getting<br/>\non board to try and help him navigate this situation, by not giving<br/>\nup, we got to see ingenuity and creativity unfold last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was REALLY cool. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are empowered by the trust we give them. When the learner<br/>\nis validated at every turn, joyful exploration of the world unfolds<br/>\nspontaneously, naturally and beautifully.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust chant that to yourself in the rougher moments Sandy; &quot;is it<br/>\nimportant to the learner?&quot;<br/>\nThat&#39;s really the crux of the whole unschooling issue. It&#39;s all about<br/>\ntrust.<br/>\n <br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7412,"nextTopicId":7429}}
