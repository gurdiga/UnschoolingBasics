If one of them is seeming bored I might ask if there&#39;s <br/>\nanything in particular they want to *do*, or just try spending more <br/>\ntime with them, be more a part of the daily &quot;doing&quot; and see what <br/>\ndirections they are going in, where they get stuck, what&#39;s <br/>\ninspiring, and then look for ways to support that process. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning isn&#39;t something you have to think about doing or choose to <br/>\ndo - its a natural part of living life. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you have a pretty full life! Puppies and cooking and <br/>\nbeaches. Laughing and talking and reading and thinking. Playing <br/>\ngames. All good stuff - and all Full of learning, every moment. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to look for ways to add to that right now. If she&#39;s busy <br/>\nand happy, that&#39;s great! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I showed her how to look it up in the dictionary. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This sort of thing happens pretty naturally in my house. It took <br/>\nawhile for it to &quot;feel&quot; natural with my stepson, who left school at <br/>\n13, so for awhile we&#39;d kind of skimp on &quot;how to find this out for <br/>\nyourself&quot; sorts of information. We&#39;d just tell him what he wanted to <br/>\nknow. Nowadays he&#39;ll come and ask &quot;how do I find a recipe for pizza <br/>\ndough?&quot; or whatever and we&#39;ll show him how to look up the <br/>\ninformation. But then again, *I* might ask him &quot;how do I find out <br/>\nwhat bands Richard Thompson has played in over the course of his <br/>\ncareer?&quot; and Ray will show me. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do you think we are on the right track?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like you are learning to let go and live more naturally. <br/>\nThat&#39;s great! <br/>\n<br/>\nIts a process. It takes time to get out of the habit of thinking in <br/>\nterms of &quot;learning experiences&quot; or &quot;teachable moments&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, continue to work on seeing the learning that happens in <br/>\nnormal, natural, everyday sorts of things - in everyday sorts of <br/>\nPlay! Not just &quot;academic&quot; learning, but learning about emotions, <br/>\nideas, and preferences. About communication, problem solving, and <br/>\nawareness. So much of that learning happens under and around the <br/>\nstuff we call &quot;play&quot; that its easy to miss or disregard. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 14)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99005687,"authorName":"sherrildr2000","from":"&quot;sherrildr2000&quot; &lt;sherrildr@...&gt;","profile":"sherrildr2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"DD and learning","postDate":"1221878456","msgId":36104,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdiMW5ybytwcWQ4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36118,"prevInTime":36103,"nextInTime":36105,"topicId":36104,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My DD Faith and I had a talk tonight, I asked her what she was interested in learning, she told me, the history about the 1950 s.

She is <br/>\ninto baking.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did a lot of play this week.  We enjoyed the last day of the <br/>\nspray park with some other HS kids.  We also enjoyed a day at the <br/>\nbeach with HS kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday she started messing around with some old phonics computer <br/>\ngames, they are way to easy for her.  She really enjoyed them, <br/>\nhowever.  We laid on my bed and took turns making up a sentence for a <br/>\nstory about a Dog named Fart, we laughed and laughed.  She and I were <br/>\ntalking about herds of animals and we tried to think of how many were <br/>\nin a herd.  I showed her how to look it up in the dictionary. <br/>\nApparently they don&#39;t teach that in 3rd grade.  We took her out of <br/>\nschool last Feb. during 3rd grade.  We also read a book she is <br/>\ninterested in.  She counted hops around the pool as well.  We had a <br/>\nreally nice day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is also enjoying being the main caretaker of a 10 week old foster <br/>\npuppy we picked up from the surrender on tuesday.  Of course she <br/>\nwants to keep it, however we are at the town limit.  The puppy is <br/>\nbeing adopted next sunday.
