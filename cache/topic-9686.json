It&#39;s so easy to use, even a child can operate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompact and portable, it can be used anywhere -- even<br/>\nsitting in an <br/>\narmchair by the fire -- yet it is powerful enough to hold as<br/>\nmuch <br/>\ninformation as a CD-ROM disc. Here&#39;s how it works:<br/>\n<br/>\nBOOK is constructed of sequentially numbered sheets of paper<br/>\n<br/>\n(recyclable), each capable of holding thousands of bits of <br/>\ninformation. The pages are locked together with a custom-fit<br/>\ndevice <br/>\ncalled a binder, which keeps the sheets in their correct<br/>\nsequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpaque Paper Technology (OPT) allows manufacturers to use<br/>\nboth sides <br/>\nof the sheet, doubling the information density and cutting<br/>\ncosts. <br/>\nExperts are divided on the prospects for further increases<br/>\nin <br/>\ninformation density; for now, BOOKs with more information<br/>\nsimply use <br/>\nmore pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach sheet is scanned optically, registering information<br/>\ndirectly <br/>\ninto your brain. A flick of the finger takes you to the next<br/>\nsheet. <br/>\nBOOK may be taken up at any time and used merely by opening<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike other display devices, BOOK never crashes or requires<br/>\n<br/>\nrebooting, and it can even be dropped on the floor or<br/>\nstepped on <br/>\nwithout damage. However, it can become unusable if immersed<br/>\nin water <br/>\nfor a significant period of time. The &quot;browse&quot; feature<br/>\nallows you to <br/>\nmove instantly to any sheet and move forward or backward as<br/>\nyou wish. <br/>\nMany come with an &quot;index&quot; feature, which pinpoints the exact<br/>\nlocation <br/>\nof selected information for instant retrieval.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn optional &quot;BOOKmark&quot; accessory allows you to open BOOK to<br/>\nthe exact <br/>\nplace you left it in a previous session -- even if the BOOK<br/>\nhas been <br/>\nclosed. BOOKmarks fit universal design standards; thus, a<br/>\nsingle <br/>\nBOOKmark can be used in BOOKs by various manufacturers.<br/>\nConversely, <br/>\nnumerous BOOKmarkers can be used in a single BOOK if the<br/>\nuser wants <br/>\nto store numerous views at once. The number is limited only<br/>\nby the <br/>\nnumber of pages in the BOOK.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also make personal notes next to BOOK text entries<br/>\nwith an <br/>\noptional programming tool, the Portable Erasable Nib Cryptic<br/>\n<br/>\nIntercommunication Language Stylus (PENCILS).<br/>\n<br/>\nPortable, durable, and affordable, BOOK is being hailed as a<br/>\n<br/>\nprecursor of a new entertainment wave. Also, BOOK&#39;s appeal<br/>\nseems so <br/>\ncertain that thousands of content creators have committed to<br/>\nthe <br/>\nplatform and investors are reportedly flocking. Look for a<br/>\nflood of <br/>\nnew titles soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9681,"nextTopicId":9688}}
