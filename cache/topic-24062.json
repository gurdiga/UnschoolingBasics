He told me after all he said that it was<br/>\njust an opinion and I can take from it what I paid for it LOL.  So<br/>\neven though he said things I didnt totally see eye to eye with him on<br/>\nhe was totally supportive of me.. I am just now developing a<br/>\nrelationship with him and this is so much what I needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not going to go into what he said because I know it was because<br/>\nhe doesnt really know what unschooling is.  And he wants what is best<br/>\nfor his grandkids.  Nothing was bad mind you..  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell what made me to most excited and happy was I discussed with him<br/>\nthe conference.. I so so so want to go but have no money.  We have had<br/>\na lot of unexpected expenses come up recently.. My eye being the most<br/>\nrecent.  We have no health insurance for Kheled and myself so<br/>\neverything is out of pocket.  Plus we need to repair the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell anyways.. I told him the total cost I needed to cover and he<br/>\ntalked to his fiance (they getting married tomorrow in Vegas) and are<br/>\ngoing to see if they can do.. Jolene said if this is something that<br/>\nneeds to be done then we do it.  He has his own business and he has<br/>\nhad a rough year so far.. But he said as long as he could pay on<br/>\ncredit card he might be able to do it.. He is buying a $7000 engine on<br/>\nnext Friday and that is what is putting it on hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my family can still go even if we end up only being able to pay<br/>\non the last possible day.. July 31st right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI also called my mom and she was going to see what she could do too..<br/>\nI love that they love me enough to support me and my family in what is<br/>\nimportant to us.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23888,"nextTopicId":24007}}
