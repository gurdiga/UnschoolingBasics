For example,  <br/>\nthere is help on how to respond when something goes really wrong for  <br/>\nyour child and you can&#39;t fix it, at least immediately. We&#39;re in the  <br/>\ncar, driving across Arizona, a hundred miles from the next rest stop,  <br/>\nthe kid wants to stop NOW and get ice cream. These books would have  <br/>\nsome ideas for ways to respond to that which would not escalate the  <br/>\nbad feelings, but help the kid get through the next hour and a half  <br/>\nwhile waiting. Beats the heck out of a parent feeling helpless and  <br/>\nmaybe even getting frustrated and angry that the child doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand the constraints.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m most definitely not saying these books, in and of themselves, are  <br/>\nperfect. To me, the authors missed the underlying principles of many  <br/>\nof their OWN ideas - they don&#39;t have a unifying basis and so the  <br/>\nimpression is just that these are &quot;techniques&quot; that &quot;work.&quot; THAT I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - for someone who has (or is developing) a truly respectful  <br/>\nparenting approach, these books are really great at helping provide  <br/>\nideas for words to use. My husband was at a complete loss - he  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t understand why a kid would toss wet towels on the furniture  <br/>\nafter she&#39;d been very nicely asked to not do that (I should mention  <br/>\nthat we have a pool and the kids have to walk through the living room  <br/>\nto get to the bathroom or their bedrooms AND we do get mold and wet  <br/>\nstuff doesn&#39;t dry quickly when piled up). SHE had good intentions -  <br/>\nbut she was and is VERY much in a hurry and very often doesn&#39;t take  <br/>\nthe few seconds it takes to stop and think about what she&#39;s doing. I  <br/>\nkept telling him that he didn&#39;t need to get irritated with her, just  <br/>\nremind her nicely. But HE thought she shouldn&#39;t need reminding and  <br/>\nthat she was doing it on purpose and so on. &quot;I&quot; could just say, &quot;Hey,  <br/>\nhoney, take your towel with you,&quot; and her internal response  <br/>\n(conscious or not) would be, &quot;Oh - yeah - my towel, thanks for  <br/>\nreminding me.&quot; But he&#39;d say things like, &quot;How many times do I have to  <br/>\nremind you to take your towel.&quot; Or, &quot;You forgot your towel again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain - nothing wrong with a reminder - but HOW to do it matters a  <br/>\nlot. He&#39;d hurt her feelings over and over by the tone and by the  <br/>\nwords he chose. I showed him the little section of the &quot;How to Talk&quot;  <br/>\nbook about &quot;Use a Word&quot; and that was a really big eye-opener to him.  <br/>\nNot just that she&#39;d &quot;do what he wanted.&quot; That was the LEAST important  <br/>\npart - it was that he realized that she truly wasn&#39;t purposely  <br/>\nignoring him, that she wanted to be helpful, that she was fine with  <br/>\ntaking her towel, and so on. Changed the way he thought of her ---  <br/>\nthat&#39;s a lot different than saying he just found a technique that  <br/>\nworked to let him control her.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] You have to read this","postDate":"1139335307","msgId":9868,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhEQTMzODcxLUQ3NkQtNDJDMS1CRURFLUI3RUM1MDE4MDI3OEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFEMjMwRTNFLUJFNUUtNDhGQS05RkM5LTAzRkUxOTcyN0Q4Q0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMWUwMWM2MmE4NiRiOTQ5NDk5MCQ4ZTU1ZjdhNUBob21lY3B1MjAwNjAxMD4gPDk0M0VFNEM1LTc0MTYtNEJGMy04MDhFLTQwOTM1NkJFRTNENUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PiA8QkFZMTA2LURBVjI0QURCQkQ1RUQ5NEYzNzM1N0REODFEMTAxMEBwaHguZ2JsPiA8MUQyMzBFM0UtQkU1RS00OEZBLTlGQzktMDNGRTE5NzI3RDhDQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":9859,"nextInTopic":9879,"prevInTime":9867,"nextInTime":9869,"topicId":9787,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
