It was nice to read  <br/>\nsomething where you&#39;ve gone both ways and shown that kids do work  <br/>\nthrough issues. Especially mentioning the power issue with your 3yo.  <br/>\nWe see a lot of that with my 4yo and 2yo, that&#39;s really why they are  <br/>\nplaying. And for pointing out that it *is* counterintuitive!<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats too, on the feeding tube. Bre has DSI, and at one point  <br/>\nprofessionals were pointing us towards forced feedings. We really did  <br/>\nnot like that issue, but unschooled her eating, provided lots of  <br/>\nopportunity and praise for being brave, and she has one of the most  <br/>\nextensive diets I&#39;ve seen in an autistic child. Now, on bad sensory  <br/>\ndays she really does push more towards her favorite comfort foods,  <br/>\nalmost all goldfish and chocolate chips, but I&#39;ve seen her push aside  <br/>\ndessert for a big bowl of broccoli!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On May 25, 2006, at 5:49 PM, Willa Ryan wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- !<br/>\n&gt; From: &quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:billyandjoanne@...\">billyandjoanne@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This happened slowly, not overnight.
