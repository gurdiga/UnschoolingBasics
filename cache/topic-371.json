We","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1055668900\">This is just my personal opinion, and you can throw it out with the bath<br/>\nwater, but I can&#39;t see being so hard on Helen for the decisions she is<br/>\nmaking.  We have so much to learn from her, being Unschooled herself as well<br/>\nas Unschooling her child/ren which is something VERY few of us can say.  I<br/>\nthink Helen has excellent views on Unschooling and wants just as much as the<br/>\nrest of us to sing the praises of it, but Helen(and correct me if I&#39;m wrong<br/>\nHelen) just seems to be pointing out that Homeschooling is the general term<br/>\nwe all fall under.  I don&#39;t see how, for myself, I lose anything as a<br/>\nbeliever in Unschooling by also supporting Homeschooling.  When I began to<br/>\nresearch about keeping my kids out of school it was HEM magazine that<br/>\nintroduced me to it and it brought me directly to Unschooling.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave known shit, to put it bluntly if it wasn&#39;t for that magazine.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nfall in to Unschooling, I wasn&#39;t naturally doing it and just not having a<br/>\nname for it and it did and still does take work for me.  I gain comfort from<br/>\npeople such as Helen and yourselves which have the experience and the years<br/>\nbehind them to back up what they are saying.<br/>\n     I don&#39;t condone School at home, but for me that&#39;s not what<br/>\nhomeschooling even is.  Through HEM I could see that it was many things and<br/>\nI had a choice, thankfully I chose Unschooling.<br/>\n    It just makes me a little sad to see such bashing of people who have<br/>\nbeen at Unschooling for so much longer than the majority of us.  They are<br/>\nour foundation and we continue to learn from what they have been, and still<br/>\nare going through.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion.<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marbleface@...\">marbleface@...</a>]<br/>\n  Sent: Monday, June 07, 2004 9:11 AM<br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Typical day/cleaning/meals & unschooling<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

For now, to me, it looks like quite a muddled <br/>\nattempt to steer me -- as an unschooler -- and I don&#39;t need to be steered. Not by <br/>\nHEM and not by any other organization or group or individual that takes it into <br/>\nits head to start defining things.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those newbies here trying to get their heads around unschooling -- enjoy! <br/>\n:) It&#39;s a great way to live and learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of us who hear (too much) about how other people think we should be <br/>\ndoing things, I guess I&#39;ll give up even trying to understand what HEM is up <br/>\nto and put this in the category of &quot;people I smile at while walking away.&quot;  <br/>\nEventually I&#39;ll hear what the new definition is and be informed whether I&#39;ve been <br/>\ndoing it right all along. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMeals -- we eat at vaguely set times but all over the house. I get a chuckle <br/>\nout of the TV ads urging us to be sure to have dinner together so we can spend <br/>\ntime together. Gad -- I see them 24/7 -- I want to have my spaghetti and turn <br/>\noff my brain for a few minutes at dinner time! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNeatening up -- DD does it, DS doesn&#39;t. But he has a door. We impose health <br/>\nstandards -- and towel standards -- he has to bring dishes and laundry out or I <br/>\nrun out of towels. :) Or I go get them. Either way, it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, I&#39;m no Martha Stewart. I read about scrapbooking in our local paper the <br/>\nother day. Women spending thousands on these wonderful looking photo albums. <br/>\nI had just gone to the dollar store and bought 3 storage bins and was so proud <br/>\nof myself for getting our photos out of the garbage bags they were in and <br/>\nsorted into the storage bins. Hey, I have standards -- just not very high ones! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOK -- off to a day of bill paying and Tae Kwon Do (DS getting ready to test <br/>\nfor his 2nd degree black belt -- a big deal) and library and who knows what <br/>\nelse. It&#39;s hard for me to think of a &quot;typical day&quot; story -- I guess our days are <br/>\nall the same, in a way. But so full of little things -- like the cool forensic <br/>\nscience site I just saw -- have to tell the kids about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy unschooling! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNance<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":438,"nextTopicId":480}}
