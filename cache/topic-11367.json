I am pleased having<br/>\nhim home and  he seems very happy. I think that I had this vision of<br/>\nhim taking on  projects, reading on his own, exploring things, etc. and<br/>\nit&#39;s just not  happening. Am I expecting too much, too soon? All he&#39;s<br/>\ndoing right now is  riding his dirt bike, playing playstation, watching<br/>\nTV, and playing  basketball and baseball. Reassure me that it&#39;s all<br/>\ngoing to be OK.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\nBetsy, I can totally relate to your fears.  I am slowly becoming more comfortable/confident in our own deschooling experience.  I took my 15 year old (sophomore by school measurments) ds out of public school 7 weeks ago.  Since that time, the deschooling *he* has chosen isn&#39;t what *I* planned but I can&#39;t say I am surprised.  He gets up around 1 p.m., showers, sometimes eats...sometimes doesn&#39;t, his friends get out of school at 2:30 and he hangs with them until 6 or 7 p.m. when they all go home for dinner and homework.  He goes upstairs to his room, plays Playstation and watches TV until 1 or 2 a.m. and repeats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has been in school most of his life since I was a single mom until he was 7, he began daycare (in a woman&#39;s home with only my son and her son) at 12 weeks.  He stayed with her until 2 years old at which time she moved out of state and he began KinderCare. He has been in the &quot;system&quot; until 7 weeks ago.  So by the &quot;deschooling time-line&quot; (referenced as 1 month for every year in school) he would need 14 months or more.  School *work* was not something he enjoyed or even did.  He went solely for the social aspect.  Loves his friends, playing on the school soccer team, meeting girls... &lt;g&gt;...but rarely did the &quot;work&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLike others here have stated, reading all the wonderful post from those living unschooling gives me hope and calms my fears ...unfortunately only temporarily.  (This is why I read EVERY post!)  I realize *I* have SO much deschooling to do and finding it challenging in many ways.  First, I am a type A personality and obviously been conditioned by my parents and school and career choice to be very goal/achievement driven. This is my &quot;gremlin&quot; that I have to tame.  I just wish there was a magic wand one of you could wave over my head and ...poof... my fears and old beliefs would disappear.  In addition, my husband (ds&#39;s stepfather) is NOT really on the same page as I am and not really willing to learn about it - yet...  I invited him to come to the NE Unschooling Conference but he hasn&#39;t given me an answer yet.  I believe this could do all of us a great deal of good.  He is also extremely type A.  He is in sales (we all know how UN-unschooling that field is!!) and he believes that college degrees are mandatory to survive in the lifestyle we currently have.  We both have a hard time living in the now and tend to make choices based on how it may affect the future...How do I let me husband know that IF DS chooses to strive for having &quot;things&quot; in life that we should trust him to figure out how to acquire them?  DH thinks that if we don&#39;t require DS to go thru the system we are setting him up for failure.  However DS was getting poor grades so the system and their rules/requirements wouldn&#39;t have worked for him anyway.  Anyone else working on her DH?  Any good insight to share?  Links to Sandra&#39;s page I could print and ask him to read?  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more positive note and back to ds and our new journey... I am anxious to spend time *with* him.  Learning about him.  Healing old wounds, gaining trust in our relationship, loving him where he is right now.  Many of my acquaintances in the schooling world say things like...&quot;Oh, a teenager, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll like  each other again when he&#39;s 25 or so.&quot;  Like it&#39;s normal and the age he is we aren&#39;t *supposed* to like each other.  Well, I am not willing to lose 10 years!!!  So at the advice of all you gentle parents, I asked Justin (DS) if I could learn to play Playstation with him on Wednesday night.  (We had just gotten home from a Sixers basketball game that he and I attended together).  He taught me and we played for about 15-20 minutes.  It was midnight and I was just too tired to continue.  So last night, he asked if I wanted to play!  It was almost midnight again and I just couldn&#39;t force myself to do it.  So...with just this one experience, I am getting my wish!<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to when he wakes up today and seeing if he can fit a quick game in with MOM!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this wonderful group!<br/>\n<br/>\nHealth and laughter,<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith <br/>\nYour Sales Director <br/>\nwith The Pampered Chef<br/>\n856/810-9912<br/>\nwww.pamperedchef.biz/faithweikert<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;Learn to love, respect and enjoy other people.&#39;<br/>\n-- Dale Carnegie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11337,"nextTopicId":11389}}
