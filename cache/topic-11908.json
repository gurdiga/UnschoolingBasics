It is not the govt&#39;s<br/>\nbusiness to decide who can and cannot share a room. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand the guideline for foster care because<br/>\nthere you&#39;re dealing with kids who did not grow up<br/>\ntogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have kids of opposite sex who share a room, in a<br/>\nmanner of speaking. Their clothes are in the same<br/>\ncloset and their books are on the same bookshelf. But<br/>\nboth of them actually sleep in our room. I&#39;m sure at<br/>\nleast a few social workers will frown on that too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in India where most people have only one or<br/>\ntwo bedrooms. Siblings of opposite sex sleeping in the<br/>\nsame room is not at all unusual. Growing up, we viewed<br/>\nthe rooms as places to keep things and the sleeping<br/>\narrangements were fluid. So the rooms were never<br/>\nidentified as kid&#39;s room or parents&#39;s room.<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
