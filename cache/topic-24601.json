My gut<br/>\nfeeling is, they will, they do, I did, lol, and if they do, let&#39;s keep <br/>\nthem as<br/>\nsafe as possible...but again, that implies restrictions vs self learned <br/>\nwisdom,<br/>\nyou know?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...I have a 17 year old - the one I want to unschool - who I am <br/>\nlearning<br/>\nto &quot;unparent&quot; (not my favorite term, but ya&#39;l know what I mean, I <br/>\nhope). I have<br/>\n  lifted his curfew, we talked about responsibility to one&#39;s self and <br/>\nwith<br/>\nfreedom, comes different types of responsibilities. I am alone in this, <br/>\nas I am<br/>\nwith much of my wild parenting style ;) So...support? Thoughts? Ideas?<br/>\nRuminations?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nTeens WILL experiment---not nececssarily with drugs or drinking or sex, <br/>\nbut with *many* different life choices. That&#39;s what they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s forbidden, they will sneak it. If they&#39;re sneaking it, they&#39;re <br/>\nNOT going to tell their parents when they are in trouble. If they trust <br/>\ntheir parents completely, they WILL call when they are in difficult <br/>\nsituations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s *much* more important to me that Cameron be SAFE. Everything else <br/>\nworks around that premise. He *has* called us when he was high to <br/>\neither ask for a ride home or to tell us he was staying the night. He <br/>\nknows how much we value him and his safety. I don&#39;t want him arrested <br/>\nor dead in an alley or by the side on the road. We&#39;ve talked about not <br/>\nbuying pot from people he doesn&#39;t know, about keeping his paraphenalia <br/>\nwell-hidden, about being very careful where and with whom he smokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never agreed to buy him stuff, but Cam and I talked about not buying <br/>\n from strangers and buying organic whenever possible. I wouldn&#39;t hand <br/>\nhim a fifth of vodka and say, &quot;Go for it&quot;---but we do talk about high <br/>\nend beers and wines and liquors vs. rot gut.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got drunk with three friends on his 15th birthday. Dangerously <br/>\ndrunk. Ironically, it was a sobering experience---he now drinks very <br/>\nlittle. A very occasional beer or glass of wine at home or other safe <br/>\nenvironment.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe told me yesterday that he was uncomfortable being around a lot of <br/>\nhis friends now because they ALL want to be drunk or high all the time. <br/>\nHe knows he doesn&#39;t need that, and he doesn&#39;t like to hang around with <br/>\nthem now because of that. (All these guys are/were schooled with <br/>\nparents who don&#39;t understand them.) He&#39;s struggling with this right now <br/>\nand trying to find some folks he&#39;s more comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question to you becomes: What will you do/say when you find him <br/>\nwith alcohol?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour answers will tell a lot about how you feel about it. If you can <br/>\nverbalize to HIM---AND follow through *to the letter*---what you will <br/>\ndo/say the *first* time, he *may* start to believe you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut poking around his things to see whether he *was* drinking the night <br/>\nbefore will not win you trust points. Neither will asking whether he <br/>\nwas drinking or how drunk he got. But BEing there for him time and time <br/>\nagain WILL show him you trust him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dropped Cameron off one time at a concert and said, &quot;If you&#39;re going <br/>\nto get high, please be smart and careful---and call me if you need me.&quot; <br/>\nHe laughed and said that all the other parents were probably saying, <br/>\n&quot;Don&#39;t get high!!!&quot; &lt;g&gt; He appreciated that I was realistic. He KNEW he <br/>\ncould count on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIronically, he&#39;s never (knock on wood) had any incidents with the law <br/>\nor been in any dangerous situations (well, except for that drunk night <br/>\non his birthday). Every one of his friends and cousins has been <br/>\narrested or in a dangerous spot. Buying pot from an undercover cop, <br/>\nDUI, drug paraphenalia found in their cars or dorm rooms, rehab, beaten <br/>\nup by a dealer---all SORTS of stuff!  ANd these are all *GOOD* kids. <br/>\nThey&#39;re just doing stupid stuff---and aren&#39;t in a position to tell <br/>\ntheir parents/ask for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron&#39;s safety is THE most important thing to me---and he knows it. <br/>\nI&#39;m sure it was hard for him to call us the first time; but when we did <br/>\nwhat we said we would do---with no shaming or anger, just relief that <br/>\nhe&#39;d called us, he knew he could trust us.

From <br/>\nwhat you&#39;ve written previously he seems to think you are a bit mad and a bit <br/>\nirresponsible. I don&#39;t know if his sense of you and, given what you&#39;ve <br/>\nwritten, his sense of himself is a sense that will produce a responsible <br/>\nsocial drinker.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I don&#39;t really believe that there is a lot you can do to control <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s actions when you aren&#39;t around. It seems that if you can make sure <br/>\nhe knows you will come and get him if he is too drunk to cope, if you won&#39;t <br/>\njudge him, if he won&#39;t be in trouble, it may go a long way to helping him to <br/>\nsee how much you are willing to support him.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, my two children are being raised in a household with two parents <br/>\nwho drink a glass of something most evenings. David (dh) brews his own beer. <br/>\nSimon (ds) has made his own apple cider, it didn&#39;t quite hit hard cider. <br/>\nBoth Simon and Linnaea have tried alcoholic drinks and, while Linnaea enjoys <br/>\nthe occasional sip of mead and Simon likes very slightly alcoholic cider, <br/>\nthey really don&#39;t like drinking. They are only 10 and 7, so there isn&#39;t the <br/>\nhanging out with friends, having an illicit drink sort of appeal, but they <br/>\nare growing up in a household where illicit drinking is unlikely to be that <br/>\nappealling or really that illicit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I don&#39;t know. I suppose it might be a good step in your <br/>\nrelationship with your son, but it may just go further to confirm his <br/>\nfeelings that you are a loosey-goosey parent &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kidgie@...\">Kidgie@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, June 20, 2007 9:47 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] teens and drinking<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; All, may I ask you for your thoughts about teens and drinking?
