Too much<br/>\nfocus on it can engender resistance. The fact she *is* eating breakfast<br/>\nand dinner and some snack in the mid-day and some milk means she *is*<br/>\nfeeling hungry at certain times and eating something when she is hungry<br/>\nBUT it very likely doesn&#39;t correspond to what and when you have the idea<br/>\nshe &quot;should&quot; be eating. Rather than &quot;giving&quot; stuff, maybe keep a snack<br/>\ntray (those divided type plates work well) of nuts, dried fruit, M&Ms,<br/>\npre-sliced veggies (and have handy containers of ranch dip or whatever<br/>\nhandy), whatever happens to be fairly &quot;stable&quot; and generally acceptable<br/>\n(for instance, don&#39;t put out tofu cubes if that&#39;s an automatic &quot;yuk!&quot;<br/>\nbut if it&#39;s a favorite, go for it). Keep in mind that &quot;3 square meals<br/>\nper day&quot; is NOT a rule, nor is it even the best way to eat - talk to<br/>\njust about any nutritionist and they recommend eating smaller portions<br/>\nmultiple times per day (5 to 6 times per day usually) rather than 3<br/>\nsquares. It keeps the blood sugar more stable and tends to be healthier<br/>\nin the long run. I know for us, my DS (he&#39;s 8 1/2) has pretty much<br/>\nalways been on a 36 hr eating cycle. He&#39;ll eat a bunch Monday morning<br/>\n(for example), a light mid-day and little in the evening. Tuesday he<br/>\neats light in the morning, a bunch mid-day, and light evening. Wednesday<br/>\nhe eats lightly until late afternoon then eats a bunch from around 4 to<br/>\naround 9. Thursday is generally an &quot;average&quot; day all around. Friday he&#39;s<br/>\nback to lots of food in the morning. And so on. Round and round. With<br/>\nvariation for growth spurts, activity levels, seasonal changes even.<br/>\nBeen this way since he was nursing on demand (which is why I noticed it<br/>\nparticularly). As he&#39;s gotten older, he&#39;s gotten a little closer to a 24<br/>\nhr cycle but it&#39;s still not exactly there. We don&#39;t worry about it - the<br/>\nfood is available for him to get or ask us to get (depending on whether<br/>\nit&#39;s something that needs cooking - there are things he *can* cook but<br/>\nchooses not to do because of the flame of the gas stove). It&#39;s not<br/>\nunusual when he&#39;s in a &quot;morning&quot; day for him to eat a 3 egg omelette,<br/>\ntwo pop tarts like things, and some fruit between waking (around 8<br/>\nusually) and 11 am. On the other hand, it&#39;s also not unusual for him to<br/>\neat two portions of pasta, meatballs, and 2 hot dogs between 5 and 9 pm<br/>\nwhen he&#39;s in an &quot;evening&quot; day. <br/>\n <br/>\nOne thing you might consider offering is to make smoothies for her since<br/>\nshe likes milk (which is a food, not a beverage BTW) - milk, fresh<br/>\nfruit, yogurt, and put in a couple ice cubes to make it shake like or<br/>\nuse some vanilla ice cream or something similar (frozen yogurt would<br/>\nkill two birds with one stone). Basically, &quot;beef up&quot; the milk that is<br/>\nher favorite. Oh, also, I didn&#39;t notice if you indicated how old she is.<br/>\nAnd, too, some people have texture issues with certain foods or types of<br/>\nfoods which might be why she falls back on smooth, cool, familiar milk.<br/>\n <br/>\nDon&#39;t call it &quot;Breakfast&quot; or whatever - that tends to have built in<br/>\n&quot;this is what is acceptable&quot; foods eg &quot;breakfast&quot; is cereal or eggs or<br/>\npancakes or whatever; lunch is soup, sandwich, etc; dinner is meat and<br/>\nveggie. Rather, just ask what she would like to eat if she evinces an<br/>\ninterest in food. DS has often grabbed a cold hot dog for &quot;breakfast&quot;<br/>\nand we often have pancakes for dinner and there have been times that his<br/>\nevening &quot;snack&quot; was a 3 egg cheese omelette at 8:30 pm. So, instead of<br/>\noffering &quot;proper&quot; breakfast foods or whatever, ask what it is she would<br/>\nlike, offer to prepare her something, ask her to add items she might<br/>\nwant to the grocery list, etc. If you are making something, ask if she<br/>\nwould like some, but do it lightly, as you would ask a friend who might<br/>\nbe visiting. No motive or pressure, just an offer.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

When he was young his family was really poor,<br/>\nthey rarely had enough food and everyone did without at times, but<br/>\nmostly his parents because they provided for the kids before<br/>\nthemselves. Then when he was about seven his parents both got good<br/>\npaying jobs and the money started coming in. With that came the food -<br/>\nand lots of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve heard stories about him sitting down with a bowl and a gallon of<br/>\nmilk and eating a whole box of cereal for breakfast everyday. His<br/>\nmother says that she would offer to bake cakes and trays of cookies<br/>\nfor the two kids each day and they&#39;d be gone by lunchtime. His parents<br/>\nfelt guilty because for years they couldn&#39;t afford to buy their kids<br/>\ncereal and cookies and other &quot;normal&quot; childhood food items.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir guilt, subsequent encouragement to overeat and the years of<br/>\ndeprivation of these foods all combined to create a very unhealthy<br/>\nsituation - both physically and emotionally. They gained weight and<br/>\nwere heavy all through their school years and as they got older they<br/>\nboth developed related medical conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nDH still struggles with his urge to eat an entire package of cookies<br/>\nin one sitting or to go back for third and fourth servings at a<br/>\nbuffet, long after he&#39;s full, until the point where he feels ill. I<br/>\nthink it&#39;s a built in reflex that goes back to the days when he didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow where the next meal would come from, so you ate as much as<br/>\npossible when you could. And this was aided by the fact that when his<br/>\nparents began earning good money they literally brought the buffet<br/>\nhome and encouraged them to eat as much as possible. I think they felt<br/>\nit was an expression of love to be able to give them all the foods<br/>\nthey couldn&#39;t afford before and it was satisfying to know the kids<br/>\nfeeling full all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how much influence an experience with food can have on<br/>\neating habits 30 years later...

When I was growing up there were very few obese people I knew or saw on the streets. The &quot;fat&quot; people there would be considered at a good healthy weight here. People there are very body image conscious and exercise a lot and eat very healthy for the most part.<br/>\n  Out of the 4 kids ( 2 boys and 2 girls) I was the &quot;fat&quot; one. I have to laugh at that today because when I look back at my pictures as a kid I was just perfect and not fat at all.<br/>\n  But non the less that is how I was Portrayed so my parents , specially my dad, always kept a tab on &quot;How much&quot; I ate. I heard all the &quot;don&#39;t eat to much you will get fat&quot;, &quot; didn&#39;t you just have lunch?&quot; or &quot; you don&#39;t need another slice of cake&quot;etc<br/>\n  It was not about &quot;what&quot; I ate as much as &quot;how much and how often&quot; I did. So to this day I really don&#39;t care about sweets that much. It was not  a big deal if it was sweets , candy or plain food. <br/>\n  I have only been able to control my weight exercising which I do love but I struggle with eating a lot way pass my hunger and until I am overfull.<br/>\n  I think that was because I was always on a &quot;diet&quot;all the time as early as I can remember. No they did not put me on a diet. I was on one. No I was not fat but I &quot;could&quot; get fat.I  tried to not eat when I was hungry between meals and  I specially  felt guilty  about eating all the time and was always in fear of getting fat.<br/>\n  So I have struggled with loosing and gaining weight since I was 16. That was when I spent my first summer  living in the US and had no one tell me I needed to eat less and everyone thought I was skinny so I gained over 50 lbs in 7 months.<br/>\n  I was almost anorexic when I was 20 ...I was 100 lbs and still trying to loose weight at almost 5&#39;5&quot; not pretty.<br/>\n  Deschooling my eating has helped a lot with maintaining  weight and I just dropped a bunch of weight after having my now almost 1 year old.<br/>\n  My two brothers and my sister never had a weight issue because they were never told not to eat or they were going to get fat. <br/>\n  My sister only started having some weight issues after she had her first daughter very young and my dad started telling her she was fat and did not need to eat that much!<br/>\n  She was living at home at the time. Girls have to look drop dead gorgeous in Brazil so there is a lot of pressure.<br/>\n  I think the fear and the guilt I have associated with eating is horrible. If I eat when I am hungry and whatever I want I keep my weight or even loose a bit but if I start feeling guilty I had too much ice cream I start  eating until I am stuffed and then I really start gaining weight.<br/>\n  Let your kids learn to  follow their body&#39;s cues for being hungry or not.
