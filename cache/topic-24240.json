Just about anything up for dissection on these lists is good for discussion with our kids!<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I can talk about many things with my dd, *she* draws the line about anything to do with sexuality, personal hygiene and anything else personal which might embarrass her.  I&#39;ve struggled with how to talk with her and how to give her information or my ideas and feelings, since she is adamant about her privacy in those areas.  I realized that she doesn&#39;t like to be subjected to scrutiny while she tosses ideas around in her head and heart and will put up a wall to stop it from happening.  I wanted to respect her, but still wanted to be sure she was informed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we hit on something together.  I asked if I could write letters to her.  She said sure.  I still worry on occasion that I&#39;ve written something that&#39;s upset her and she won&#39;t tell me, but for the most part, I can tell by her subsequent actions (picking up a book I&#39;ve recommended, though privately; from things she says) that she *has* read my notes.  We both feel better - I&#39;ve given her my opinions, feelings or information and she is taking it in without feeling overly scrutinized.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI try to make sure she has resources she might need, to use in her own way, in her own time.  I can&#39;t make her be ready when I&#39;m ready to discuss issues.  If I honor her need to do it this way, perhaps she&#39;ll talk more with me when she feels ready.  She might choose not to.  Maybe she will talk to Diana; to have another adult who would listen and be there for her would be a gift.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":288405080,"authorName":"diana jenner","from":"&quot;diana jenner&quot; &lt;hahamommy@...&gt;","profile":"dianajenner","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] diana","postDate":"1181336861","msgId":24284,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY1MThhOTM2MDcwNjA4MTQwN3E3ZjlmN2UzY3lkYzg3NWE5M2RjOTFlOTFjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY4NDUzMWZjMDcwNjA4MTM0MnI3YmQxYzc4MHVjNjg2NTVhMmU1MWIzOWZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDYwOTcwNy43OTIzNi5xbUB3ZWIzODUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8OEM5NzgyMjkyMkVDMkE2LTYzOC1GNzY1QFdFQk1BSUwtTUMxNi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4JIDxmODQ1MzFmYzA3MDYwODEzNDJyN2JkMWM3ODB1YzY4NjU1YTJlNTFiMzlmY0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":24282,"nextInTopic":24287,"prevInTime":24283,"nextInTime":24285,"topicId":24240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hayden, 8.7, just awoke.

THE question!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough a few moms have come in and said (recently even) that their <br/>\nrelationships with their children *do* change overnight, most happen <br/>\ngradually as we let go of control and she our children as trying to be <br/>\nable and capable and wanting to be the best people they can be. They <br/>\nhave few tools to makebig decesions, so if we let them make smaller <br/>\ndecisions that don&#39;t endanger themselves, they&#39;ll be able to think <br/>\nthrough bigger, more important decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschooling relationship is based on mutual trust and respect <br/>\nrather than on control and obedience.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will do whatever they want to as long as they can get away <br/>\nwith it. It<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter how they have been &quot;schooled.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo unschooling kids that I know. None. Not a one. They value their <br/>\nparents&#39; input and make well-thought out decisions. Even if they aren&#39;t <br/>\nthe ones the parents would make, the parents respect that they made <br/>\nthat choice and are there for them if it doesn&#39;t work out the way they <br/>\nexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you talking about sex with other parents children?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause they teens trust her enough to ask difficult questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey aren&#39;t afraid of adults because they&#39;ve been treated as equals. So <br/>\nwhen they have questions that their parents cannot answer---or when <br/>\nthey find someone who has more knowledge than they do and who is <br/>\nwilling to talk with them, they&#39;ll ask. That&#39;s an excellent quality to <br/>\nhave!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that a bit odd. I wouldn&#39;t appreciate it if I found out that <br/>\nanother parent was talking to<br/>\nmy kids about sex, and especially would find it very odd if my child <br/>\nwas telling<br/>\nanother adult how he/she pleasures his/her lover.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciated it very much. Diana gives sessions on sex for adults and <br/>\nteens. She&#39;s a wealth of knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much do *you* talk to your child about sex?

How is she to believe that the next time you tell her something <br/>\nis harmful that you are telling the truth?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf these kids are unschoolers, and have such wonderful open <br/>\nrelationships with<br/>\ntheir parents, why are they coming to you?Forgive me if I missed some <br/>\nwhere that<br/>\nyou are a teen counselor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, you did miss something (Diana is a trained facilitator of a <br/>\ncomprehensive sex-ed program called OWL (Our Whole Lives) for teens <br/>\n(see www.uua.org/OWL).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even if she weren&#39;t, another opinion from a caring adult is a GOOD <br/>\nthing!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids were given alot of freedom, including freedom to make mistakes.<br/>\n  Luckily, mine never desired to try drugs, or do anything that would <br/>\nend up<br/>\n  harming them. That is not always the case in every home. If they did, <br/>\nI&gt;<br/>\ncertainly would have stepped in and not stood there and watched them <br/>\nhurt<br/>\nthemselves.

Experimenting is what teenagers <br/>\nDO.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf mine are going to experiment, I want them to do it knowing that I am <br/>\nhere to help them. They can come to me with questions. More <br/>\nimportantly, they can come to me if they DO get in an <br/>\nuncomfortable/dangerous situation. I&#39;m here to rescue them, not shame <br/>\nor ridicule them! Or worse, forbid them from trying anything new.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJumping on a trampoline.......taking drugs....two totally different <br/>\nthings here.<br/>\nHow can you even compare them??<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t *comparing*---she was showing the progression.

We&#39;re here to supprt and help them through them---even if <br/>\nwe wouldn&#39;t make the same choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe drugs won&#39;t kill a kid, maybe they will.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMost won&#39;t. Saying that they will doesn&#39;t make it true. Being <br/>\nhonest---totally honest---about the pros and cons of all things---even <br/>\nif you wouldn&#39;t make that choice is what will gain a child&#39;s trust and <br/>\nrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not talking about russian roulette here with a child&#39;s life.<br/>\nAnd no sex, probably won&#39;t kill your teen, but seriously how can a 13 <br/>\nyear old<br/>\nmentally handle a sexual relationship?? Could you at 13?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know 27 years olds who can&#39;t mentally handle sexual <br/>\nrelationships---even 50 year olds.

You don&#39;t believe <br/>\nunschooling can create a different kind of relationship between <br/>\nparents and kids, especially teens. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents of teens will tell you differently - are telling <br/>\nyou differently. We really do have a different kind of relationship, <br/>\na whole different way of interacting with our teenage family <br/>\nmembers. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do we get there? Trust and openness and listening to them and <br/>\nsupporting them and taking their needs and wants and wishes <br/>\nseriously. It really works. You don&#39;t even need to start out <br/>\nunschooling at grade K, it works for families who start with teens - <br/>\nit takes some healing and deschooling, but that openness and <br/>\nlistening and supporting is something that even someone who has <br/>\nalready been a parent for more than a dozen years can learn to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Some kids will do whatever they want to as long as they can get <br/>\n&gt;away with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>In my home, there is *nothing* for my stepson to &quot;get away with&quot; <br/>\nbecause nothing is forbidden to him. That makes an enormous <br/>\ndifference. He doesn&#39;t have to hide anything. He doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nvalidate his wants and wishes or hide them - because we are <br/>\nsupporting his wants and wishes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I told my stepson he wasn&#39;t allowed to play with fire, would that <br/>\nstop him? I doubt it. He&#39;d sneak off and do it anyway. So I&#39;m <br/>\nfinding ways for him to do it safely. He practices with his <br/>\n(currently unlit) fire-staff daily so that he can get good enough to <br/>\ndo it lit without burning himself. He has the *luxury* of doing that <br/>\nbecause he knows we&#39;ll let him set the thing on fire when he&#39;s <br/>\nready. We&#39;ll even buy the fuel. In the meantime, we&#39;ve made sure he <br/>\nhas opportunities to swing fire-poi, which require much less skill, <br/>\nunder the eye of a friend who is a professional street-performer and <br/>\nknows how to be safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It doesn&#39;t matter how they have been &quot;schooled.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right, what matters is the parent&#39;s commitment to creating a <br/>\ndifferent sort of environment, of working through their (our) own <br/>\npersonal bs regardless of how uncomfortable that may be. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling changes people and relationships. It doesn&#39;t happen at <br/>\nall without trust, though. If you don&#39;t trust that this kind of <br/>\nrelationship is *possible* - not inevitable, not guaranteed, but <br/>\n*possible* - and that its possible for *you* and your family, then <br/>\nno, it won&#39;t matter a bean how long anyone has been schooled or with <br/>\nwhat curriculum or lack thereof.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269152394,"authorName":"Lorrie","from":"Lorrie &lt;iamhisservant4ever@...&gt;","profile":"iamhisservant4ever","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"diana","postDate":"1181286728","msgId":24240,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwOTcwNy43OTIzNi5xbUB3ZWIzODUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24253,"prevInTime":24239,"nextInTime":24241,"topicId":24240,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I cannot imagine a 14 year old, told no for the first time with great understanding, would do such a thing.

Oh, but wait, we&#39;re NOT talking about<br/>\na child who has been honored and respected for her first 14 years. NOT a<br/>\nchild who has an open, loving, non-judgmental relationship with her parents.<br/>\nThis seems to me to be the actions of a girl who is just plain fed up with<br/>\narbitrary limits imposed upon her by her parents, from whom she&#39;s separated herself long ago. <br/>\nWow, so you knew this family I am assuming. Since you seem to know that she was not honored or respected and her parent were not open or loving, and were judgmental. <br/>\nWho is doing the judging now? And once again the girl was 13 when it all started, not 14. Any parent that would let their 13 year old carry on with an 18 year old boy, is not a caring, loving parent. In my opinion they are just finding the easy way out and allowing their kids to do what they please as long as they stay out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSex as a forbidden fruit. Ick! Is she having sex only to piss off her<br/>\nparents or because she really wants to express her love in a physical way?<br/>\nYes, I am sure that she was having sex to piss off her parents, not to hold onto teh 18 year old. Expressing love at 13 or 14 with sex is not how I would want my child to express it. Anyone that thinks this is normal has a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, though, remember we&#39;re NOT talking about a child who was mindfully<br/>\nparented, let alone unschooled. Unschooling creates a totally different<br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\nHow does unschooling suddenly create a totally different relationship?  Some kids will do whatever they want to as long as they can get away with it. It doesn&#39;t matter how they have been &quot;schooled.&quot;<br/>\nOf the unschooling kids I&#39;ve talked Sex with (again, a big number), most<br/>\nhave had the regular mechanical questions, some safety concerns, and the<br/>\nvery best conversation I ever had was with an 18 year old who was/is<br/>\ncommitted to being a sweet, considerate, pleasuring lover of his girlfriend,<br/>\nwhom he is madly in love with. I&#39;ve yet to meet a one who is participating<br/>\nin sexual behaviours out of a lack of self-worth or lack of available<br/>\nlove/connections at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are you talking about sex with other parents children? I find that a bit odd. I wouldn&#39;t appreciate it if I found out that another parent was talking to my kids about sex, and especially would find it very odd if my child was telling another adult how he/she pleasures his/her lover.<br/>\n<br/>\nRestricting your child&#39;s actions based on your own fears is Manipulative and<br/>\nControlling. It&#39;s not respectful nor honoring of the human being before<br/>\nyou. Smash a marshmallow with your thumb. How much of it actually stays<br/>\nthere?( okay, why????)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, restricting a child from doing anything that will end up harming them is not being manipulative or controlling, it is called good parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have yet to meet even one unschooled kid who behaves/feels this way, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve met many. Have you?<br/>\nIt&#39;s really cool when an unschooled teen comes to me for advice (on Sex,<br/>\nDrugs, Parents, you name it) I know they&#39;re not asking me because they can&#39;t ask their moms, they&#39;re asking because they want *my* opinion to add to their repertoire, as another trusted adult. Not THE trusted adult.<br/>\nIf these kids are unschoolers, and have such wonderful open relationships with their parents, why are they coming to you?Forgive me if I missed some where that you are a teen counselor.<br/>\n<br/>\n My kids were given alot of freedom, including freedom to make mistakes.<br/>\n Luckily, mine never desired to try drugs, or do anything that would end up<br/>\n harming them. That is not always the case in every home. If they did, I&gt; certainly would have stepped in and not stood there and watched them hurt  themselves. That is NOT being controlling, it is being a parent that loves<br/>\n their children!<br/>\nSo, you&#39;re saying that if I see Hayden jump precariously close to the edge<br/>\nof the trampoline, I should remove him and order him to stay off of it? It<br/>\nworked out just fine for us that he bumped his shin (his great story of how<br/>\nhe *broke his leg* at age 4), he was welcomed and comforted by his watching<br/>\nmama, he then took another &quot;deep breath of courage&quot; and got back on the<br/>\ntramp. And has been happily jumping ever since.<br/>\nJumping on a trampoline.......taking drugs....two totally different things here. How can you even compare them??<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen folks are paranoid about drugs and sex with their kids, I always worry<br/>\nthey&#39;re gonna lie to the kids and erode an imperative Trust between parents<br/>\nand spawn. Cocaine kills! Til the first time the kid tries it and doesn&#39;t die. Then what? They (the parents) must have lied about everything else! Sex kills! il the first time the kid does it and doesn&#39;t die. Honest, judgment free<br/>\nconversations are the best birth control I&#39;ve ever known.<br/>\nI am not paranoid, just realistic. Maybe drugs won&#39;t kill a kid, maybe they will. We are not talking about russian roulette here with a child&#39;s life.<br/>\nAnd no sex, probably won&#39;t kill your teen, but seriously how can a 13 year old mentally handle a sexual relationship?? Could you at 13?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of things I don&#39;t want to be in this world - Liar tops that list. Hypocrite being a close second.<br/>\nI am guessing that I am a hypocrite to most unschooler son this board since I believe in being a loving, caring parent and want the best for my kids.
