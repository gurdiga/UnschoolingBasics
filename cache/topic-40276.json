Fortunately I found Diaper Free Baby (http://www.diaperfreebaby.org) as well as some books about Elimination Communication. It is basically just tuning into her signals when she needs to go and offering opportunities. My guy went naked a LOT and  I just let him unless we had to go somewhere. We did have some accidents, and I did use a lot of Bac-out at some point. But he also was out of diapers at 1. He went back into them at around 14 months and a few months later was out for good. He never peed in bed after around 1 y.o. but had to go right when waking up. Sometimes if he woke up to nurse he needed to go after and he would just give me the sign (he was  not verbal for some time). There are some soft cottony pads you can put on the bed for protection and then she could sleep naked. That might help as well. <br/>\nPlaytime in the car might help as well.<br/>\nGood luck,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;jennifercroce37&quot; &lt;jennifercroce37@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to be asking for so much help, but I am at a loss for how to deal with these issues in the context of unschooling.

My 4 yr old really wants to get to be a big kid so he doesn&#39;t have to sit in one. Honestly the things look uncomfortable to me. We take several important items with us and we race to the car. Those items are a sippy cup (I keep an extra handy in the cooler in the car so it is already full and ready to go at the first stop and I cycle them through and frozen juice boxes, they work well for ice packs and defrost on hot days quickly), favorite snack food, favorite toy of the moment, pillow and favorite blanket. Actually both kids bring their pillows and blankets along no matter the weather. My son always gets to win and be first into the car, by himself. He chatters constantly so I keep up with his chatter as he climbs in and gets situated. This can take 10-15 minutes. I know that the first sign of my impatience, even when I try to hide it, it takes twice as long because he gets frustrated.<br/>\n Being first, being a big kid, and doing things by himself are very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the naked bum, no reason not to let her run naked. If you do a general cleaning and mop up accidents quickly sanitation isn&#39;t an issue. My daughter ran naked right up until she started school (she went k-3rd). My 4 yr old woke up this morning and actually put clothes on because the house was a bit chilly from the air conditioner. However, I suspect he will be naked soon enough. Having a naked bum while potty training is a huge benefit. Dealing with pulling pants or under pants up and down causes frustration. When a little one says they have to go the translation is they had to go 10 minutes ago. Let her be proud of her little body and show it off. I think the pictures my mom took of me while potty training I was naked in all of them. I would also recommend keeping a potty chair in various rooms and taking one with you when you go out.

Have someone else come over and hang out with her for a little, while you are out. That way, the whole process could be less trausmatzing for the both of you! Eventually, she&#39;s going to have to get into the car seat, but that&#39;s probably a good problem to try to figure out when neither of you are rushed or upset.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: More advice please","postDate":"1243382042","msgId":40280,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMDkwNTI2MTY1NHQ3NWIyOTM1ZnU2YmU4OTNkMzRkYmFkODk4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGd2aHNocStnZWI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd2aDhwYit2bzAzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Z3Zoc2hxK2dlYjRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40279,"nextInTopic":40282,"prevInTime":40279,"nextInTime":40281,"topicId":40276,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

With lots of exploration and fun--turning on the windshield washers and blinkers--with you in it, she&#39;ll be safe and watched over. And let her explore it to her heart&#39;s content. That&#39;ll help get the power struggle out of the situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you feel yourself getting tense, take a breath!! Unless she&#39;s about to break a knob or fall against some icky, oily hinge, why can&#39;t she check it all out?--to her it&#39;s fascinating! You can always refill the washer fluid, you can sing to the blinky blinky of the turn signals. How cool is it that she&#39;s discovered a &quot;playhouse&quot; that&#39;s her size! <br/>\n<br/>\nFind out what&#39;s got her attention. Enjoy it with her and help her check it all out, all the little secret compartments and holding pockets. It&#39;s all very cool. My son, at 9, *still* loves to hang out in the car when we can. When we have to go, we go, but if we can hang out, he loves just kicking back and talking and looking at the trees or birds through the window or off the tailgate. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve already made it comfy, with the books and bubbles and snacks and blankies, just expand the &quot;playroom&quot; to the whole car when you can. Then when you *have to* go somewhere, maybe it&#39;ll be easier for her cuz she&#39;ll be satisfied.<br/>\nAnd no, I didn&#39;t say leave her in the car by herself at any time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as the diaper thing---same advice sort of. Let her have lots of time naked. She wants to do it. If she&#39;s relatively clean and washed, it&#39;s not dangerously germy. Let her have control over her undies and diapers. That&#39;s *real* &quot;self initiated potty training&quot;. Make it her choice completely. You can voice your preferences, of course, to not have her go on the floor (or in the bed), but you can work out the solution for that *with* her. Most kids don&#39;t want to have an accident on the floor/bed either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to head out right now, but I hope that helps.<br/>\n~~Juillet <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;jennifercroce37&quot; &lt;jennifercroce37@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sorry to be asking for so much help, but I am at a loss for how to deal with these issues in the context of unschooling.
