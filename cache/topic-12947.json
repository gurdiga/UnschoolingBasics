This college<br/>\nis starting with projects and then throwing in some<br/>\ntheory. It makes a lot of sense because the students<br/>\nthen have a real interest and need to learn the<br/>\ntheory. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some interesting quotes from the article:<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nMiller (the president) explains the philosophy behind<br/>\nwhat he calls the &quot;do and then learn&quot; approach.<br/>\n&quot;Students start out with an audacious project, which<br/>\nwould in many institutions be heretical, except we do<br/>\nthat deliberately,&quot; the amiable 56-year-old executive<br/>\nsays. &quot;Because, after all, when you get hired in a<br/>\ncorporation, that&#39;s the first thing that happens to<br/>\nyou: they give you a challenge for which you&#39;ve not<br/>\nhad the prerequisites. It&#39;s all about learning how to<br/>\nlearn. So we do that here from day one.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n...<br/>\n<br/>\nThey (i.e the faculty) wanted to determine whether<br/>\nstudents have to sit through a barrage of fundamental<br/>\ncourses before designing and building anything at all.<br/>\nThey divided the students into small groups and<br/>\nassigned them a task: they had eight weeks to design,<br/>\nbuild, and demonstrate a pulse oximeter, a medical<br/>\ninstrument clipped onto a patient&#39;s finger to<br/>\nelectronically measure pulse rate and blood oxygen<br/>\nlevel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe professors showed the groups a commercial unit and<br/>\nreferred them to relevant patents and other technical<br/>\ndocumentation in a step-by-step guided design. The<br/>\nfaculty&#39;s plan was to watch carefully as the groups<br/>\nprogressed and discover where and why they failed.<br/>\n&quot;The problem is, they didn&#39;t fail,&quot; Miller says. &quot;They<br/>\ngot it to work. This wasn&#39;t the highest-quality<br/>\nfabrication in the world; it was a very crude-looking<br/>\ncircuit board with a lot of transistors. But it<br/>\nworked. And we said, &#39;Aha! There&#39;s something to this.<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to have prerequisites.&#39; &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEven more revealing, he adds, was the effect the<br/>\nexercise had on the students. &quot;They now wanted to know<br/>\nwhat a transistor isÂ—badly. They now had a sincere,<br/>\ndeep, personal motivation to learn electromagnetic<br/>\ntheory and circuit design. These kids will never<br/>\nforget the experience they had in that project.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe article is here<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3432\">http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3432</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nManisha<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
