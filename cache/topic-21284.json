In our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1914481988\">I wanted to weigh in on this, because we just finished a very interesting weekend. Josh&#39;s <br/>\nparty was yesterday, and the plan was a video game party. In our house, we have three <br/>\ntv&#39;s, one with cable, five gaming systems, two vcrs and dvd players, five gameboys and <br/>\ntwo DS&#39;s. My kids can take them or leave them. We can have days of gaming, and then <br/>\ndays without. The kids who came to the party however, all come from very limited homes. <br/>\nOne has to earn video time, point per point, another can&#39;t play until all chores and <br/>\nhomework are done. Three come from a home where no tv is allowed, unless it&#39;s <br/>\neducational or religious, no video games at all. Two more have TV, but parents have <br/>\nultimate control and they have to share a GBA. Last two from a house where tv/gaming is <br/>\nlimited as punishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was amazed to see how very dedicated some kids were to the video games. It was painful <br/>\nreally, to see how emotionally dedicated they were, to getting a fair share of time. <br/>\nFortunately the girls totally understood this, and were able to step back and let the guys <br/>\ngorge themselves. &quot;We can play whenever we want, we&#39;re lucky to have you...&quot; Awww. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t that long ago that I was pretty limiting on what I &#39;allowed&#39; the kids to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I took Josh shopping, and there was a mom who was looking at the games next to <br/>\nus. She kept asking me what the rating was for this game or that, and I had no idea. She <br/>\nwas astonished, and asked me finally, &quot;Well, how do you know it&#39;s okay for the kids to <br/>\nplay?&quot; Um. Because I play with them? That didn&#39;t go over well, but her sons were okay with <br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Julie Peters&quot; &lt;julieannpeters@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What&#39;s funny is that we were very ANTI-box/electronics before <br/>\n&gt; unschooling.

TV can be a source of comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is not the problem. The need for very bored women with few outlets  <br/>\nto self-comfort is the problem. Taking away TV might give the  <br/>\nillusion that the problem had gone away but it would just be buried  <br/>\nbeneath other behavior. And I&#39;m sure they had outlets for the boredom  <br/>\nand frustration before and I&#39;d bet good money that there were a lot  <br/>\nof unhealthy practices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf children are using TV as a way to comfort themselves -- as I did  <br/>\nafter school and on weekends when I was a kid -- the solution isn&#39;t  <br/>\nto take away TV. The solution is to work at eliminating the stress  <br/>\nthat&#39;s causing the need for comfort.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooled kids shouldn&#39;t be using TV as a comfort for a stress  <br/>\nthat we have the power to eliminate. We should be eliminating the  <br/>\nstress, not making ourselves feel better by eliminating the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeschooling kids are recovering from stress. Sometimes that means a  <br/>\nlot of TV (because it&#39;s relaxing *and* because it was often limited).  <br/>\nBut without the stress, without the limits, kids do move onto other  <br/>\nthings.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The worst behaviors that I developped as a teen were from watching<br/>\n&gt; telavision.

(I had typical teenage  <br/>\nirritation but it was a combination of hormones and disconnection  <br/>\nwith the family caused by school and traditional parenting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTV doesn&#39;t cause people to disconnect with each other. People choose  <br/>\nTV as a solution to other problems (stress, disconnection, boredom).  <br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t make TV the cause of the disconnection any more than  <br/>\nfood is the cause of people being overweight.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have problems. They seek solutions to those problems.  <br/>\nSometimes they choose solutions that make them feel better in the  <br/>\nmoment but don&#39;t get at the root cause of the problem and sometimes  <br/>\nmakes the problem worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t make the solution a demon. It doesn&#39;t help find a  <br/>\nsolution to put the responsibility for behavior on an outside source.  <br/>\nThe responsibility for our choices lies squarely with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; When I return to Canada in the summer, it&#39;s my<br/>\n&gt; intention to completely forgo the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And lots of people happily choose no TV or no electricity or no plastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling is about opening our children&#39;s worlds, helping them  <br/>\nexplore *their* interests, not narrowing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile moms can choose to live their own philosophies, if their  <br/>\nchoices limit their children, they&#39;ll be undermining unschooling and  <br/>\njoyful living.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome moms are vegetarian while allowing their children freedom of  <br/>\nfood choice. Some moms forgo plastic while allowing their children to  <br/>\ncollect Happy Meal toys. Adopting a philosophy is choosing to make  <br/>\nour lives more difficult in order to get something that we feel is  <br/>\nbetter. Imposing a philosophy on someone else, making their lives  <br/>\nmore inconvenient for the sake of our philosophy, is not a way to  <br/>\nbuild better relationships. It puts a philosophy ahead of family and  <br/>\ntears down relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I also remember reading studies that<br/>\n&gt; TV can lower your metabolism and puts you into a form of trance.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a discussion on the arguments against TV here:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/tv%20and% <br/>\n20video%20games/argumentsagainsttv.html<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It<br/>\n&gt; stunts all conversation in the room (most times).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And if I were to read a book aloud, it would also stunt conversation.  <br/>\nListeners might ask questions.

First is how to handle a<br/>\nchild who is having difficulty and the second one is TV&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to children acting up. I don&#39;t believe in physical<br/>\npunishments, sending a child &quot;to their room&quot; or time out in an area<br/>\naway from the rest of the family. However, I feel that children need<br/>\nto learn from a young age that their action has a consequence. IE. If<br/>\nyou throw something, you have to pick it up. If you hit your sister,<br/>\nyou don&#39;t get to play with her for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren are needy by nature but it doesn&#39;t mean that they should be<br/>\nallowed free reign to do what they want. If your daughter or son were<br/>\nto start hitting you whenever the urge hits, would you allow it or<br/>\nwould you distract him from that behavior? I don&#39;t mean using<br/>\nconsequences as a form of punishment but rather, as a tool to show<br/>\nthem that for every cause, there is an action.<br/>\nTakig away the TV or making them sit down is not having confort<br/>\nremoved, especially if mommy or daddy are right beside them giving<br/>\nthem hugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly is television. I&#39;m currently living in Saudi Arabia where<br/>\nbecause of such nasty segregation, most women spend their free time<br/>\ninside and either weatch TV or play video games. This country has been<br/>\nreduced to a stupor because of it. Hobbies and passtimes are virtually<br/>\nnon-existent, with the exception of going to the shopping malls. I had<br/>\na student come into my class this year who is almost 5, yet had never<br/>\ncolored or looked through a book. He had never handled scissors nor<br/>\nsociallized with ANYONE other than his younger brother. He is<br/>\nencouraged by his mother to be abusive to the mai (but that&#39;s another<br/>\nstory)...and this is a member of the royal family! Thak God, he was<br/>\nable to gain lots of skills in our class (it&#39;s a montessori school)<br/>\nbut this is only one example of the damage TV has done to ths society.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know a single young teenager here who hasn&#39;t memorized the<br/>\nBuffy TV series, yet ask her what she does other than watch TV (or go<br/>\nshopping) and she&#39;ll usually shrug. I was equally getting caught up in<br/>\nTV until I deleted all teh Western TV channels from the satellite and<br/>\nsurprise, surprise, all of the sudden I have all of this free time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worst behaviors that I developped as a teen were from watching<br/>\ntelavision. From running out of the room when annoyed to insulting and<br/>\nbeing rude to my parents, I have the lovely american sitcoms to thank<br/>\nfor that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTV is not all bad, documentaries are wonderful learning tools and it&#39;s<br/>\nnice to watch a movie now and then, or the news for that matter but on<br/>\nthe whole, my personal experience has shown that TV causes much mor<br/>\nedamage than benifits. When I return to Canada in the summer, it&#39;s my<br/>\nintention to completely forgo the TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need to find the sources, but I also remember reading studies that<br/>\nTV can lower your metabolism and puts you into a form of trance.

A couple months ago, when he had a really bad spell, I was saying a lot of the same things you did in your post, including thinking about sending him to school (to protect his sibling!).  As with your son, this behavior started kind of suddenly.   Actually, it started not long after my dad died suddenly (he collapsed hiking) and we&#39;d spent the month of December going back and forth to my mom&#39;s house.  The kids hadn&#39;t been particularly close to Daddy, but I was deeply grieving.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest you go *buy* the book (I think you&#39;re refering to the Explosive Child).  Ask your husband to read it too.  It&#39;s not about unschooling, per se, at all, but the approach to the rages is compatible and he explains it really well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the difference between that little girl at the playground and your child is that her mother wasn&#39;t doing *anything*.  If her child couldn&#39;t interact with the other children appropriately, her mother should have been right there at her side, guiding her and interacting with her -- not *after* the aggression but before (or rather, in place of).  Or maybe just not at the park at all, but instead having playdates at home with one other child.  It&#39;s one thing if it happens once and you talk about it, but if it&#39;s the child&#39;s regular mode of interaction then clearly they need active supervision and guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n <br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: susangould1 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ggould1@...\">ggould1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main question is how should I be responding to ds when he gets so <br/>\n<br/>\nangry? &lt;snip&gt;   I have that book on hold <br/>\n<br/>\nfrom the library but I am #8 in line for it.

We are fairly new to unschooling.  We pulled dd who<br/>\nwas in gr3 and ds who was in kindergarten out of public school this<br/>\nOctober.  Mostly because dd had very low self esteem because of<br/>\nissues at school.  Things were going great until early December and<br/>\nwe had to spend 5 weeks in another Provence (we are from Canada) due<br/>\nto a family illness.  This put a lot of stress on the kids and myself<br/>\nbeing at my Mom&#39;s house.  She says she is supportive of my decision<br/>\nto unschool but she still thinks spanking is necessary to make my<br/>\nkids listen and be good.  So needless to say there was a bit of<br/>\nnegative feelings during that time on top of my Dad having a major<br/>\nstoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assumed that when we got back home everything would go back to<br/>\nnormal any we would be happy again.  Well not the case!  My son is<br/>\nacting out verbally and physically alot!!!  Hurting his sister, the<br/>\nanimals, our stuff and myself.  He is a bit more controlled with my<br/>\nhusband but not completely.  Everyone is miserable.  I am trying my<br/>\nbest to be a good Mom.  I know he is going through something<br/>\nemotionally mostly having to do with Grandpa being so ill and not<br/>\nresponding to him due to the stroke.  I have been trying to give him<br/>\nmore quality attention, always saying &#39;yes&#39;, being more<br/>\nrespectful,etc.  I am trying to follow the Sandra Dodd website but it<br/>\ndoes not seem to be working. He is increasingly mean.  (I have no<br/>\nidea what to do) I am finding that we cannot even go out anywhere<br/>\nbecause we never know when he is going to &quot;blow&quot;.  This is not fair<br/>\nto my dd who is most happy out and about.  I feel pulled apart in two<br/>\ndirections and nobody is getting what they want or need.  We run a<br/>\nhome based heating and air conditioning business so my husband works<br/>\nALOT.  Like 12-14 hour days and when he gets home he is physically<br/>\nand mentally exhausted and in no mood to deal with the kids.  I feel<br/>\nso alone with no support.  I have no one to talk to because everybody<br/>\nI know has their kids in school and they don&#39;t understand.  They all<br/>\nthink I am crazy and if I let them know that things are not great<br/>\nthen they just say put them back in school.  I have been to a few<br/>\nunschooling group things but because ds never wants to go he is<br/>\nmiserable the whole time.  This makes it hard to make new friends -<br/>\nfor all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am having a nervous breakdown.  Maybe I just suck at<br/>\nthis and I am going to do more harm to my kids than school would.<br/>\n(But then I couldn&#39;t very well even just put them back in school<br/>\nbecause we have not done any school work this year - they would be<br/>\nway behind.)  Plus, I am scared my son is turning into a monster.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to help him stop being so angry.  My husband thinks my<br/>\nproblem is just winter blues as it is very cold here this past month.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is does anyone ever feel like this?  And what should I be<br/>\nsaying to ds when he is hitting us or screaming at us.  I feel like<br/>\neveryone is angry and miserable and it is all my fault.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny feedback would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Does anyone know if it is a kid friendly<br/>\nconference?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nVERY! It was modeled after the Live and Learn Conference, so it&#39;s <br/>\nfamily- and child-friendly. I heard lots of good feedback from the last <br/>\nconference---and Pam has a great line-up of speakers this year. You <br/>\nWON&#39;T be disappointed! GO!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main question is how should I be responding to ds when he gets so<br/>\nangry?  Do I put him in a time out?  (from what I think I know about<br/>\nunschooling this does not encourage respect but maybe I am<br/>\ninterpreting it wrong)  Do I ignore it?  Do I speak firmly and tell<br/>\nhim not to do it?  Tell him that it hurts me or whatever?  None of<br/>\nthese seem to work.  (I do realize that it takes consistency and<br/>\ntime - but which thing do I say?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEach child is different. Some need space to calm down. Some need a <br/>\ntight squeese/hug to feel connected. Some like long discussions. Some <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to hear ONE word come out of your mouth. Some like to talk <br/>\nthings through. Some need pure quiet and reflective time. Some do well <br/>\nwith redirection.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works *best*?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n How do I respectfully get through<br/>\nto him that he cannot do these things?  I know that he is acting this<br/>\nway for a reason  - our parenting skills probably - which we are<br/>\nreally trying to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nConsistency helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  We are new at unschooling.  (Has anyone<br/>\never seen it work? - a total shift to unschooling life from<br/>\nauthoritarian parenting?)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYep. I was never authoritarian---but according to a poster a week or so <br/>\nago, I could have been described as authoritative. &lt;g&gt; Ben was <br/>\nauthoritarian. Cam&#39;s answer always had to be &quot;how high?&quot; Ben&#39;s <br/>\nmilitary---Citadel grad and Lt Colonel---Air Force and now Air National <br/>\nGuard. &lt;G&gt; I didn&#39;t have too much to change, but Ben DID. Now Ben&#39;s <br/>\nmade this HUGE shift---having to come way farther than I did to begin <br/>\nwith, and now surpassing me with gentle parenting at times! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, YES, it IS possible! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n While we are working on trying to respect<br/>\neach other ds is only 5 and he is not understanding the respecting<br/>\npart - there are still ALOT of blow ups.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd understandably---right? You have to be respected---for a long <br/>\ntime---to be respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I have that book on hold<br/>\nfrom the library but I am #8 in line for it.  Maybe I will just go<br/>\nand buy it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf.com, e-bay, amazon. I&#39;ve often paid more for the hshipping than <br/>\nthe book itself!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I do find that some foods that have a lot of food<br/>\ncoloring in it seem to affect him badly. But not always.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nElimination diet---find out *which* ones, specifically. It may be a <br/>\ncombo too!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do go swimming a lot but gets he angry there usually at dd.  So<br/>\nlately we have not gone very much.  I know I shouldn&#39;t care what<br/>\nothers think but really I do not like him acting like that in public<br/>\nespecially.  (I have been told by complete strangers that he needs to<br/>\nbe in school with more discipline!)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have a link  to the &quot;I Don&#39;t Care What People Think ABout <br/>\nMy Children&quot; rant I made years ago? &lt;bwg&gt; I couldn&#39;t find it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a lot of this seems to be about me and my problems with what<br/>\nis going on.  But I just don&#39;t know how to deal with this in an<br/>\nunschooling way of life.  I totally get the no school part.  But we<br/>\nwant to embrace the respectful living part as well.  Dh is having a<br/>\nbit of trouble with demanding that they do what is asked when asked<br/>\nwith no back talk.  I am trying to get him to see differently on<br/>\nthis.  But by the end of the day - especially if ds has been angry a<br/>\nlot - I just want to go and cry and dh sometimes snaps and yells .. I<br/>\nneed help and direction from others who have experience with this.<br/>\nSince I cannot confide in many people I am hoping I will find<br/>\nguidance here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child? It&#39;s a play-by-play <br/>\nabout respecting children in an easy-to-read Q&A format. It will change <br/>\nyour life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just recently we were at a thing with other homeschoolers and a<br/>\nlittle girl was there probably about 6 or 7yrs old.  She was sooooo<br/>\nmean and aggressive to all the other kids - strangers.  The mother<br/>\nwould just say don&#39;t talk like that - you need to be nice - always in<br/>\na normal voice.  The girl had a nastily look on her face and was<br/>\nobviously ignoring her mom.  In one instance another mother had to<br/>\nstep up and &quot;protect&quot; her child from this kid because her own mom was<br/>\ndoing nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou realize that this is NOT what we are talking about, right? I would <br/>\nhave taken mine away or sat right there *between* my child and others <br/>\nor found something else to do. Doing *nothing* is neglect, and that&#39;s <br/>\nNOT what we promote here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n Now my ds has not done this yet to strangers but he does it to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the *up* side, that may be because he feels safe with you. He knows <br/>\nhe can be difficult, yet you&#39;ll still love and cherish him. THAT&#39;s a <br/>\ngood thing! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMany kids are angels at school. But come home and are absolute horrors <br/>\nwith mom. They&#39;ve struggled all day to be the perfect child, and <br/>\nfinally need a place to release all that anger and frustration they&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen hiding all day. Mom&#39;s the safe outlet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was a real eyeopener that he could be on the<br/>\nsame path.  How do I get off that path to peaceful, respectful,<br/>\nhappy, joyful life????<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBy seeing where he is now and understanding that he really doesn&#39;t want <br/>\nto be this way either. He&#39;d like to have a smooth life too. He&#39;s just <br/>\nreally, really little with very few skills available to him. He&#39;s <br/>\nhonestly doing the best he can with the limited abilities he has.<br/>\n<br/>\nKNOW that, and you can start to help him cope.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

This put a lot of stress on the kids and myself<br/>\nbeing at my Mom&#39;s house.  She says she is supportive of my decision<br/>\nto unschool but she still thinks spanking is necessary to make my<br/>\nkids listen and be good.  So needless to say there was a bit of<br/>\nnegative feelings during that time on top of my Dad having a major<br/>\nstoke.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assumed that when we got back home everything would go back to<br/>\nnormal any we would be happy again.  Well not the case!  My son is<br/>\nacting out verbally and physically alot!!!  Hurting his sister, the<br/>\nanimals, our stuff and myself.  He is a bit more controlled with my<br/>\nhusband but not completely.  Everyone is miserable.  I am trying my<br/>\nbest to be a good Mom.  I know he is going through something<br/>\nemotionally mostly having to do with Grandpa being so ill and not<br/>\nresponding to him due to the stroke.  I have been trying to give him<br/>\nmore quality attention, always saying &#39;yes&#39;, being more<br/>\nrespectful,etc.  I am trying to follow the Sandra Dodd website but it<br/>\ndoes not seem to be working. He is increasingly mean.  (I have no<br/>\nidea what to do) I am finding that we cannot even go out anywhere<br/>\nbecause we never know when he is going to &quot;blow&quot;.  This is not fair<br/>\nto my dd who is most happy out and about.  I feel pulled apart in two<br/>\ndirections and nobody is getting what they want or need.  We run a<br/>\nhome based heating and air conditioning business so my husband works<br/>\nALOT.  Like 12-14 hour days and when he gets home he is physically<br/>\nand mentally exhausted and in no mood to deal with the kids.  I feel<br/>\nso alone with no support.  I have no one to talk to because everybody<br/>\nI know has their kids in school and they don&#39;t understand.  They all<br/>\nthink I am crazy and if I let them know that things are not great<br/>\nthen they just say put them back in school.  I have been to a few<br/>\nunschooling group things but because ds never wants to go he is<br/>\nmiserable the whole time.  This makes it hard to make new friends -<br/>\nfor all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am having a nervous breakdown.  Maybe I just suck at<br/>\nthis and I am going to do more harm to my kids than school would.<br/>\n(But then I couldn&#39;t very well even just put them back in school<br/>\nbecause we have not done any school work this year - they would be<br/>\nway behind.)  Plus, I am scared my son is turning into a monster.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know how to help him stop being so angry.  My husband thinks my<br/>\nproblem is just winter blues as it is very cold here this past month.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is does anyone ever feel like this?  And what should I be<br/>\nsaying to ds when he is hitting us or screaming at us.
