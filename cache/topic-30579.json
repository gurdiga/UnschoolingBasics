She is new - like BRAND new re: unschooling, and is a compassionate,  <br/>\nwonderful mom that is just starting to really explore unschooling. She is  <br/>\nchallenging herself left and right - I&#39;d hate for her newness to get lost in the  <br/>\nmiddle of these discussions. this is SUCH a great list, one that challenges my  <br/>\nthinking nearly every day, and I embrace that to no end. I came here ready  and <br/>\nin a different place in life, and as a result, I have  had less deschooling to <br/>\ndo than she. The strong opinions and knowledge here  can be daunting (at <br/>\nfirst) - but also, they can be empowering and thought  provoking. Erin is a <br/>\nwonderful mom - someone I have seen with my children and  she puts out energy and <br/>\ncaring and gentleness like no one I&#39;ve ever seen. But  yes - a schooled way of <br/>\nthinking, indeed - and you know I love you, Erin, for  all that you were, are <br/>\nand will be :) I hope this post makes some sense...<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\nWho is grateful for all the outspokenness on this list!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************It&#39;s Tax Time!
