And understanding that sometimes their &quot;meanness&quot; to their own children is because they are feeling judged and scorned.  I try to make eye contact and communicate that we&#39;ve all been there and don&#39;t worry about what others are thinking and I try to make eye contact with children that seem to be &quot;losing it&quot; so that on some level, maybe they can feel they are being heard.  My heart just goes out to them.<br/>\n <br/>\nI also find myself talking to and with others&#39; children rather than around them as I used to.  I can get on that level where I truly DO want to hear about the Rescue Heroes movie from the 6 year old as much as I am interested in what his mom is saying.<br/>\n <br/>\nUnschooling has also made me aware of how others try to talk around my children and I am able to gently re&quot;educate&quot; them not to do that.  We went to a BBQ on Labour Day and my son (who takes violin) had a lesson so we left and came back for the rest of the BBQ.  Everyone wanted to hear my son play and they kept saying to me, &quot;oh, have him play for us-we&#39;d love to hear him!&quot;  They meant well but instead of my asking him (so I wouldn&#39;t communicate to him whether I wanted it or not and wouldn&#39;t seem like I was advocating for the other adults) I told them they should ask HIM if he wanted to play.  There were actually two women who seemed surprised at the notion of asking a 7 year old what HE wanted to do.  But they did and he said &quot;I&#39;d really rather not-I don&#39;t feel ready yet to play for other people-I play for me right now.&quot;  I LOVED that he could feel that he was able to answer and not bow to pressure just because it was an adult.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nThere used to be a show when I was little called &quot;Kids are people too!&quot;  Funny how we can forget that as we&#39;re ushered into adulthood.  I&#39;m remembering again and relearning it thanks to unschooling.<br/>\n <br/>\nJonni-Ann<br/>\n***Those who hear not the music think the dancers mad***<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:we3deeves@...\">we3deeves@...</a> wrote:<br/>\nIn a message dated 9/23/2004 5:21:04 AM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nI think that in our society we are programmed to think of the adults over<br/>\nchildren.Not a good excuse at all and kind of crummy......and in need of an<br/>\noverhaul for me and mine.<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nI so agree and this is why radical unschooling is so wonderful for *me (a <br/>\nbyproduct I&#39;d never expected).
