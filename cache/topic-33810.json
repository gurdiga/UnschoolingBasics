I have<br/>\nbeen on this list for about a year now.  We have always unschooled our 7 ½<br/>\nyear old son, but after reading from this list and pouring through Joyces<br/>\nwebsite we began our trek into radical unschooling.  After we heard Ren<br/>\nspeak at last years Rethinking Education conference we came home, took a<br/>\ncollective deep breath and jumped in 100%.  We have never looked back.<br/>\nThere have been questionable days and panic attacks, but nothing has come<br/>\nclose to the joy we experience everyday just being.  We have a great life<br/>\nand are very happy.   But now, weve come to a place where Im just not sure<br/>\nhow to proceed and would love any advice you all can share.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been one to care what other people think.  I am a very liberal,<br/>\noutspoken, overweight, non-blonde, non-christian, non-republican, anti-war<br/>\npacifist who quit a successful career to stay home and raise her child.  I<br/>\nam the photo negative of everything Dallas, tx is about and have lived here<br/>\nfor a decade.  Gosh, what the neighbors must think.  ;-)  Adding unschooler<br/>\nto that long list of outcast ingredients was really not a stretch.  We try<br/>\nto live our lives open and honestly, but in the culture we live in those<br/>\nthat misunderstand our way of living can cause unnecessary grief through<br/>\ntheir ignorance and my questions lie in how to handle those situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally my son will answer a what are you learning about question with<br/>\nI play video games all day.  Now I have to admit its kinda funny to see<br/>\nthe reactions of the nosy nellies in the grocery store who love to pop quiz<br/>\nhomeschooled kids.  But its a bit harder to chuckle when its our<br/>\npediatrician or fellow volunteer at the local shelter.  Up to this point<br/>\nIve always been with my son during these conversations and able to change<br/>\nthe topic of the conversation before it entered into areas causing others to<br/>\nquestion child neglect because horrors of horror he can eat ice cream when<br/>\nhe wants and play video games all day.  What a terrible mother I am.  Lol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow in the next few weeks, DS will be going to a few summer camps he chose<br/>\nat the local zoo and museum.  In addition to his all I do all day is play<br/>\nvideo games, I dont have go to school chatter, he also cant really print<br/>\nyet.  He just learned how to read in the past six months and only then<br/>\nbecause he needed to read to play a new online game he liked.  I know hell<br/>\nlearn to write the same way when hes ready.  But I am worried how he and<br/>\nhis teachers will react if they ask him to write something at summer camp.<br/>\nWere getting to the age where his age cant be used as an excuse for his<br/>\nlack of normal advancements.  I am concerned that our parenting will be<br/>\ncalled into question in a formal manner, like child services, school<br/>\ndistrict inquiries or who knows what else.  I know we could win any<br/>\nchallenge thrown at us, but why deal with the challenge in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is a very honest person.  He has no reason to be otherwise and I<br/>\ndont want to change that, but I am worried about his level of honesty with<br/>\nstrangers while Im not present.  How do you all handle such situations?  I<br/>\nknow you cant care what other think, but how do you keep the grief from<br/>\nothers thoughts (and possible resulting reactions) from distrupting your<br/>\nfamilys way of life.  We just want to live and let live.  Do we need to<br/>\nstay away from certain public situations, like summer camps?  If not, how do<br/>\nyou handle the resulting questions or grief for you and your child?  Any<br/>\nadvice you could offer would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith peace and gratitude, <br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33766,"nextTopicId":33817}}
