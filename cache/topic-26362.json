I&#39;m afraid that *I* would xyz, so I&#39;m doubly afraid my <br/>\nkids will be the same way. Several others have talked about that, so <br/>\nI&#39;m going to go in a different direction.... <br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that may help you right now is understanding that &quot;full <br/>\nautonomy&quot; for a one yr old looks very very different from autonomy <br/>\nfor a 4yo and both of those look very very different from a 10yo or <br/>\na teen. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a kid who is just starting to be mobile, autonomy around food <br/>\nhas more to do with food-on-demand (whether nursing or other or some <br/>\ncombination) and a chance to explore foods to the extent that he <br/>\nwants. Its still totally possible with a baby or toddler to have <br/>\nalmost entirely healthy options available without there being any <br/>\nsense of &quot;limits&quot; on the part of the child. <br/>\n<br/>\nA 4yo, though, is going to be substantially more aware of her <br/>\nenvironment. Even without a tv, if you take her shopping, its <br/>\npossible she&#39;ll be wanting to try lots of things she sees based on <br/>\nthe attractivenss of the packaging. That&#39;s where unschooling food <br/>\ngets tricky for many many parents - OMG my kids want to eat &quot;junk <br/>\nfood&quot;!!! Even then, its possible to say &quot;yes&quot; to many foods and <br/>\nstill have more nutritious options around. One of the &quot;tricks&quot; for <br/>\nleveling the playing field, as it were, is to make sure those <br/>\nnutritious options are just as attractive and convenient as packaged <br/>\nfoods. <br/>\n<br/>\nStrategies for unschooling food with a 4yo include putting effort in <br/>\npresentation, creating easy-to-grab small portions, making mixed <br/>\nplatters for sampling, and arranging shelves, etc so the child has <br/>\neasy access to foods all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we fill the refrigerator with what i guess i&#39;d call &quot;whole foods&quot;--<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-the raw ingredients <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with which to make a lot of things. we don&#39;t buy much processed <br/>\n </span></blockquote>food, and usually DIY our <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; treats.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One thing to check for is availability. Can your 4yo, in particular, <br/>\ngo and grab a bite *right now* without having to ask - or if she <br/>\nlikes to ask, without having to wait while you prepare something? <br/>\nThere&#39;s an autonomy check. Can she grab a bite of something that&#39;s <br/>\nnot only good for her but appealing in color, texture and shape? <br/>\nThose are important considerations for young children, in <br/>\nparticular, and can effect their sense of autonomy around food.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nuts and bolts of this issue is something that gets rather more <br/>\ndiscussion over on Always Unschooled, with its focus on younger <br/>\nchildren, so I&#39;m tossing out a link to that group, if you&#39;re <br/>\nintereseted:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i feel the same about t.v.. i&#39;m so much happier in my life when i <br/>\n </span></blockquote>don&#39;t watch it. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge and I had no tv for years before we had Mo, and only <br/>\nvideos/dvds until almost a year ago.

Simply by learning from DS and providing<br/>\ninformation to him as he asks (&quot;what does potassium do?&quot; &quot;what<br/>\n&lt;nutritionally&gt; is in ice cream?&quot; and so on). We&#39;ve seen him *consider*<br/>\nwhether he wants another ice pop or another chocolate or another &lt;fill<br/>\nin the blank&gt;. Something totally unforeseen happened in our house: when<br/>\nDH and I married, a half gallon of ice cream would be gone in a matter<br/>\nof days. A few years ago, we realized that the ice cream in the freezer<br/>\nhad actually gone &#39;bad&#39; all ice crusted and nasty - and it&#39;s happened<br/>\nmore than once since, so instead of being a standard item, ice cream is<br/>\nnow on a request basis - if someone wants some, we get it. How in the<br/>\nworld did that happen? We didn&#39;t have it off limits, we ate it whenever<br/>\nwe wanted it, BUT since we didn&#39;t have limits on it and we could have it<br/>\nwhenever, we consciously CHOSE when/whether to eat it or not. Instead of<br/>\nmindlessly just grabbing a big bowl of ice cream after dinner because it<br/>\nwas there, we&#39;d consider if we wanted it, how much we wanted, whether we<br/>\nmight want to wait a bit before having any, and even IF the others in<br/>\nthe household had some, I might not (or I might and DH might not or DH<br/>\nand I might have some and DS might not). We&#39;ve been re-learning how to<br/>\neat by listening to our own selves because that&#39;s how kids are designed<br/>\nfrom the get go and it doesn&#39;t change if they are able to freely,<br/>\nwithout the mental baggage most of us adults have, choose what and when<br/>\nand how to eat. We don&#39;t simply pile in the sweets and chips (they&#39;re<br/>\nexpensive!) but we don&#39;t avoid them if someone wants some. We also make<br/>\nmuch of what we eat from basic ingredients ourselves BUT if DH wants<br/>\nchips or DS wants a particular type of snack cake or I want some ice<br/>\ncream, we add it to the shopping list. We compare ingredients and try to<br/>\nmake the best choice we can ... and sometimes we just buy the Twinkies<br/>\nbecause that&#39;s what we want. We&#39;ve got two packages of DS&#39; favorite<br/>\norganic chocolate creme filled &quot;Oreo&quot; substitutes (he likes them better<br/>\nthan Oreos because he says the creme is creamier). They&#39;ve been in the<br/>\ncupboard, unopened, for about a month or so now. Not hidden, not<br/>\nlimited, not tucked away somewhere, one package in plain sight in a<br/>\nglass fronted cabinet (the other in the pantry closet which DS is in and<br/>\nout of regularly). It&#39;s just that no one has wanted to eat them<br/>\nrecently. And that&#39;s okay. They&#39;ll keep. At other times, packages of the<br/>\nvery self-same cookies have been gone in two or three days. And that&#39;s<br/>\nokay too.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo, I guess what I&#39;m long windedly saying is that you CAN re-learn how<br/>\nto listen to your self regarding how you eat by learning from your kids<br/>\nwho&#39;ve never NOT known that at this point. It&#39;s a choice - you can learn<br/>\nfrom them to better tune to yourself or they can learn from you that<br/>\nthere are &quot;Good&quot; foods and &quot;Bad&quot; foods and if you eat the &#39;Bad&#39; foods<br/>\nthen you &quot;lack willpower&quot; or whatever. By providing information to your<br/>\nkids as they grow, you&#39;ll be learning too. I&#39;ve spent many a long 10 or<br/>\n15 minutes at the pasta sauce aisle as DS checked *every* brand of sauce<br/>\nfor the one with the least sodium (DH is hypertensive) and that had the<br/>\nleast sugar added and no HFCS. Didn&#39;t have to. BUT he knows that sodium<br/>\nis not good for DH&#39;s blood pressure (unless it&#39;s balanced by potassium)<br/>\nand too much sugar is not great for me and HFCS is generally not a great<br/>\nthing (nor is MSG). It&#39;s not something he HAS TO do, as a &#39;lesson&#39; or<br/>\nsomething. It&#39;s something he&#39;s seen us model over time, something we&#39;ve<br/>\ntalked about as he raised questions. So now, we get comments from others<br/>\non how well versed in nutrition DS is and what a wide palate he has<br/>\n(from mac & cheese to sushi) and how did we &#39;get&#39; him to eat broccoli<br/>\n(or whatever). We didn&#39;t - it was available for him to choose; stuff he<br/>\nlikes, he eats, stuff he doesn&#39;t want, he doesn&#39;t eat. If we had<br/>\nsomething new, he could taste a bite from my plate and decide if he<br/>\nwanted any on his plate. His choice. Pretty simple if you ask me.<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, BTW, I&#39;m a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic so I *could* easily<br/>\nrationalize limiting everything coming into the house to stuff that is<br/>\nokay for me to eat (no sweets, limited types of carbs, etc). I don&#39;t -<br/>\nit&#39;s *my Choice* of what to eat and how much, some choices are better<br/>\nand some not as good, but it&#39;s not a &quot;rule&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;Choice&quot; and that<br/>\nmakes all the difference. If I thought &quot;I *can&#39;t* have that&quot; it would<br/>\ndevelop an instant allure (IME YMMV) but if I think &quot;I choose not to<br/>\nhave that right now&quot; it&#39;s no big deal - I might choose it later, I might<br/>\nnot. And what my best choice is should NOT dictate what everyone around<br/>\nme can choose to eat.<br/>\n <br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

In fact I had good solid evidence that  <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t stop once I started by polishing off 3 bags of Halloween  <br/>\ncandy before Halloween ;-) I would often eat entire rows of Oreos  <br/>\nfrom the package, then of course feel yucky a little later and swear  <br/>\nI&#39;d never have another, then later in the day have more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what I had evidence of is how I reacted to limits.

Tell yourself  <br/>\nthat when the bag is gone, you can have two more bags. I guarantee  <br/>\nyou&#39;ll get tired of it. It took me 3 bags of almond M&Ms but I can  <br/>\npass a bag in the store with no interest at all. In fact Dunkin&#39;  <br/>\nDonuts is so well aware of that phenomenon that their employees are  <br/>\nallowed to have as many donuts as they want. They know that after a  <br/>\ncouple of days they won&#39;t want any at all ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe now have a constant supply of Ghirardelli chocolate bits in the  <br/>\nfreezer and Dove miniatures and I might have one Dove a day.

Videos occasionally.  <br/>\nBy the time she was 7, though, she definitely was into Pokemon and  <br/>\nthat has fueled friendships and creativity that still impacts her  <br/>\nlife today at 16. (She just met another 16 yo girl who enjoys playing  <br/>\nthe Pokemon games and she&#39;s absolutely delighted :-) She began  <br/>\ndrawing comics based on Pokemon (one that originally was a direct  <br/>\nripoff is still going on), and now has, she estimates, over 1000  <br/>\npages of comics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and just feel<br/>\n&gt; better at the end of the day if i haven&#39;t spent it sitting and  <br/>\n&gt; staring at the t.v.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, what if it were reading books? Would you ban books and ban  <br/>\nyour daughter from books?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re choosing to do something that you don&#39;t want to do, then  <br/>\nthere are other issues than TV. TV *is* an easy way to relax. But  <br/>\nit&#39;s not TV&#39;s fault if you&#39;re stressed! I used to watch TV after  <br/>\nschool and after working. It does take energy to be creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI huge boon to being more selective about TV is TiVo (or other DVR).  <br/>\nYou can set it to record only the programs you like and then watch  <br/>\njust those when you choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne problem with TV and kids is their own feeling that they&#39;re slaves  <br/>\nto the programming schedule. The kids need to watch now while a  <br/>\nprogram is on since they can&#39;t watch later. What helped is putting a  <br/>\ntape in to record a show so we could do something else during that  <br/>\ntime.
