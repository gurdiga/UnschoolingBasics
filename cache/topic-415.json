No real change in the content of what was being taught was <br/>\nproposed, so we went home.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started off doing what I knew how to do. Very structured -- heck, I even <br/>\nread the Florida State Standards (the Sunshine Standards -- isn&#39;t that <br/>\nadorable).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne by one, I/we let go of things. Now we unschool. It was a gradual process <br/>\nthat happened over several years and I would say not at all an unusual <br/>\nprogression.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what turned me to hsing was that the usual method was inadequate to meet <br/>\nthe needs of my child. And what got us to unschooling was paying attention to <br/>\nwhat really fit us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in Florida and my mother will tell you that I was a bright child in <br/>\nschool but it never occurred to her that, even if I was bored, there was any <br/>\nother option but ps. And there wasn&#39;t -- private school was out and hsing <br/>\nwasn&#39;t a separate legal option here until 1985 (I graduated from high school in <br/>\n1975 so . . . too old :) ).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think a lot of parents are pushier now -- in a good way. :)  Regular <br/>\nsuburban (you don&#39;t even need to be in the wilds of Alaska :) ) Moms and Dads <br/>\nare digging in their heels and looking around for something better. The message <br/>\nis getting through that there are all sorts of options and we don&#39;t have to <br/>\nsettle. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting to hear how others did this unschooling thing way back when, <br/>\nbut even my relatively recent experience with my son is dated. And that was <br/>\nonly 5 years ago. Things on the testing/standardization front have gotten <br/>\nworse, not better. At least in the straight ps options. But there are other choices <br/>\n-- not everyone is going to unschool -- and parents are grabbing at them. <br/>\nMaybe some will end up being unschoolers like me -- after learning and expanding <br/>\ntheir thinking, at their own pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nNance <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 6/7/2004 6:17:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\nWhat changes peoples&#39; minds about unschooling (or homeschooling, for <br/>\nthat matter)?
