It&#39;s torn the family to shreds. Three of her children<br/>\nwill not speak to her or have any contact with her (they hate both of<br/>\ntheir parents, it&#39;s not a taking sides issue). I&#39;ve also watched her<br/>\nlife become completely and totally focused on court battles, without<br/>\nany time or energy for her own interests. It&#39;s cost in depression,<br/>\nstress and a family destroyed. Luckily they&#39;re emerging out the other<br/>\nside we think, but 8 years? Ouch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not worth it.

This is an update on my dd and unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI pulled her out of ps officially, I thought, last week. I was <br/>\ninformed by the asst principal that I did not have the right to do <br/>\nso, because my ex has the right to determine where she lives, and he <br/>\ndid not agree. I allowed her to stay out of school, anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday my ex went to court and got an order that says, in effect, that <br/>\nhe has the right to her, and I may only see her with his written <br/>\npermission, and that she must go back to public school. He refuses to <br/>\nwithdraw her legally, because she has to face the consequences of her <br/>\nactions. And those are that she has to go to school, because he <br/>\ntotally disagrees with her (and my) choice of education. We didn&#39;t <br/>\nfollow the rules and get his agreement, so he went over my head, &#39;to <br/>\nstop something really bad&#39; from happening. My ex says Claire is <br/>\ntruant. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, our dd informed him she hated him and would not <br/>\nparticipate in school, even if she had to just go and sit in the <br/>\nchair. She would not cooperate. Period. He was about to let her stay <br/>\nwith me, if I promised she&#39;d go to school tomorrow, and then abruptly <br/>\ndecided she had to come home with him after she told him she would <br/>\ngo, but would not work at her grades. She left, but was furious. <br/>\n<br/>\nI cautioned her to play his game, and keep her mouth shut. He wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to agree with her. I doubt she will, tho. She even talked to <br/>\nhim about Dead Poet&#39;s Society, wherein the boy kills himself because <br/>\nhis father won&#39;t listen to him about his future. Now I&#39;m worried that <br/>\nmy ex will put her in the psych hospital. I don&#39;t think she really <br/>\nwould commit suicide, because she knows I&#39;m on her side here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m on a very limited income as a full time student (having trouble <br/>\npaying bills, and no extra money), and can&#39;t afford an atty. I called <br/>\nlegal aid, but they fill up their appts early in the morning for the <br/>\nnext day&#39;s appts. I won&#39;t get an appt until Thursday at the earliest, <br/>\nand I want to contest this NOW. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a rant, and a plea for any suggestions. I think I was legally <br/>\nwrong to take her out of school without my ex&#39;s agreement: an atty at <br/>\nmy university told me this, and told me to get into mediation <br/>\nimmediately to get custody of dd, so I could make the decision. I was <br/>\ntrying to get with legal aid. I can attend a free clinic, but it&#39;ll <br/>\nbe tomorrow night.

I decided to homeschool him at the beginning of 7th grade, as he was drowning in the muck.  I have physical custody and we have joint custody.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can say that, though I was trained as a teacher and worked with at-risk kids, unmotivated kids, damaged by the system kids, this is by far the most difficult thing I have ever done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result though was that my son became HAPPY.  So much so that his dad noticed.  This has made a difference.  The other thing I did was to document what we accomplished and provide dad with a scrap book full of pictures from the field trips we took ( we do many cool things )- with my son&#39;s happy face prominent - and the many activities and academic work he accomplished , which, despite the struggles, he was proud of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not too late to start; it just may be hard for a while, so it requires more patience.  My son asks me why we did not start earlier ( my husband ), but he sure is glad we are doing it now.  He had thought himself a dismal failure because of his schooling experience.

To make a long story short, she decided on her own not to attend High School, and is now unschooling, so she has been out now since school let out last June. For the naysayers, give them a copy of &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; if they are people who matter (like your ex and his partner) and ignore the rest. I took a highlighter and highlighted the parts in that book that stood out for me/us to make it easier for the naysayers who did not want to go through the whole book to &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>\nAs far as schooling, my daughter made up a list of what she wanted to accomplish while out of school. It turned out to be pretty extensive: SCUBA diving, gymnastics, belly dancing, travel. I have yet to faclitate some of that stuff due to the fact that I work full time (hope to quit by the end of the year or get reduced work hours) but so far she is more relaxed, less grumpy and surly, and communicates more. I try and point those things out to the people who say she isnt doing anything. Isnt our relationship and her mental health worth more than schoolwork? I am noticing that gradually she is getting more interested in the world again, and learning naturally, not artificially just by paying attention to life. For example, I was making a dish called Mjeddrah the other night and she asked what it was so I read the description in the cookbook. &quot;Mjeddrah is a very old dish from the Middle East. According to biblical schlars, mjeddrah is the &quot;mess of pottage for which Esau sold his birt<br/>\nhright to Jacob.&quot;  I am no Biblical scholar but she spent two years in Christian School so she said. &quot;Oh yeah, i remember that.&quot; and went off to pull out her childrens bible and review the story. (we dont id as Christians but I sent her thier because we could afford it and there are no drugs there.) After that it branched off into a discussion about the merits of combining lentils and rice and the protein content of various foods, then on to the merits of vegetarianism for the health of the planet, animal rights, and  personal choices as political action. All this came from a simple question &quot;what is mjeddrah?&quot; This kind of discussion would never have happened while she was still in school. While she was in school I would pick her up and she would be depressed and surly, complain about homework, not do it, get stressed out over it, hole up in her room and stay on the computer, or get in arguments that went around and around in circles. <br/>\nThis is getting long and rambling, but now she reads alot of books and has a guitar teacher come in once a week. From the outside looking in she is not doing much, sleeping past noon and staying up way too late watching TV. But even TV is sparking interests and debate.
