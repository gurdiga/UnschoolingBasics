I&#39;ve pretty well absorbed how this <br/>\nlist works.  I&#39;ve come to understand that when I write something, and <br/>\nsomeone else writes something back that &#39;seems&#39; to be an attack... when <br/>\nI look back at what I wrote, I can see that its because I left out <br/>\ndetails which allowed responders to make assumptions.  My sofa is old <br/>\nand ratty, but it could just as easily have been a pretty sofa, and I <br/>\nnever included that in my first post.  I didn&#39;t include my strong need <br/>\nto have a comfy place to sit.  I didn&#39;t include our financial <br/>\nsituation.  Etc.   So, there was a lot of room for various <br/>\ninterpretations, and many different kinds of advice based on that.  <br/>\nReading, and weeding, through the various bits of advice, and then <br/>\nposting to clarify my particular situation, and reading and weeding <br/>\nagain, I was able to re-evaluate my priorities, our true situation, and <br/>\nmy child&#39;s needs, to come to see a new &#39;reality&#39;. <br/>\n<br/>\nLanguage, terminology, details, so much matters when writing to this <br/>\nlist.  The parents writing here are very very smart, they catch every <br/>\nlittle nuance of what I write... I wish I&#39;d had a high school English <br/>\nteacher like that!   Its novel to have someone catch all the little <br/>\nassumptions in my writing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I do think of this as a support group, but a of a different sort.  <br/>\nSupport in finding new ways of thinking regarding children.  Not support <br/>\nin the way of commiseration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI vaguely remember another group, something with the word &#39;shining&#39; in <br/>\nit, that was more of a support group?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42805,"nextTopicId":42839}}
