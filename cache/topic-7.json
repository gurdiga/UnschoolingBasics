We pulled Chuck our 14 year old out of public <br/>\nschool in the same grade as Erica. He was labled ADHD in 4th grade <br/>\nand with all the testing (You had to score a 19 to be labled ADHD <br/>\nand he score a 19 or 20) Just prior to pulling him out of school I <br/>\nhappened upon a article on the web about Vision Therapy and the <br/>\narticle was talking about Chuck (at least I swear it could have been <br/>\nwritten about him) We had him tested and found out that he needed <br/>\nglasses and had some vision problems due to muscles not forming <br/>\nproperly. I knew that when he tested so low for adhd that maybe he <br/>\nwas not that but after two years of being on ritalin and fighting <br/>\nwith the teachers, having the major &quot;meltdowns&quot; when coming off the <br/>\nritalin in the evenings and still not being able to focus on his <br/>\nwork  etc we find out that his problem was his vision. How can a <br/>\nchild possibly sit still all day and read when he could not do it <br/>\n(he needed glasses to read and had passed every since vision test <br/>\nthat was given by the school district, so they never found this <br/>\nproblem in 7 years of schooling.)<br/>\n So as will Erica I felt the same way about Chuck that he just did <br/>\nnot fit in with conventional school not just because of the vision <br/>\nstuff but with other things that was all probably brought on by his <br/>\nvision problem. <br/>\n Ok enough from me lol<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":125789604,"authorName":"Onesnotenough@aol.com","from":"Onesnotenough@...","profile":"justlikemama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] introductions","postDate":"1085856601","msgId":70,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhLjRmYjAzNDIyLjJkZWEzNTU5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65,"nextInTopic":98,"prevInTime":69,"nextInTime":71,"topicId":7,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"HI Mike and Family!

I&#39;m Crystal.  I&#39;m on a couple of lists (unschooling <br/>\ndiscussion, always learning and unschooling.com, &quot;hello everybody&quot;) <br/>\nbut I don&#39;t get to post as much as I&#39;d like because I work so by the <br/>\ntime I read a thread, usually everyone has already answered.  Plus, <br/>\nI hate to post an answer and not be able to get back for a couple of <br/>\ndays, you know?  Anyway, I&#39;ll try.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout me:  I&#39;ve been unschooling with my two youngest, Sean-15 and <br/>\nErica-14 next month, since Oct of 2001.  Erica finished 5th grade in <br/>\nschool and Sean finished 6th.  Erica and I took to unschooling <br/>\nimmediately.  She and I had no problem deschooling, but Sean just <br/>\ndeschooled within the last few months (is that a deschooling <br/>\nrecord?)!  Up until then he believed he had to get a high school <br/>\ndiploma and then go to college to be sucessful.  Recently, though, <br/>\nhe found a love for cooking and he&#39;s finally seeing that there is <br/>\nmore than one path to success.  He even told me he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\ncooking if he was in school.  Unfortunately he&#39;s still doing the <br/>\nteenage rebel thing that schooled kids do, though less often.  <br/>\nWithout unschooling I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have lost him by now, either to the <br/>\nstreets or to the courts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nErica left school one month into 6th grade and unable to read.  Of <br/>\ncourse we didn&#39;t know that was her &quot;problem&quot; because the school had <br/>\nher labled as ADHD and just an all around difficult child.  I put <br/>\nproblem in quotations because it wouldn&#39;t have been a problem had <br/>\nshe never gone to school.  I also don&#39;t believe she ever had ADHD.  <br/>\nShe just couldn&#39;t conform and I don&#39;t think she ever will.  Right <br/>\nnow she draws, and writes poetry and stories.  (She&#39;s reading over <br/>\nmy shoulder right now and says she mostly draws and reads and role <br/>\nplays which is a form of story writing with other people online.  <br/>\nShe also says she&#39;s learning new words.)  She&#39;s funny.  She keeps <br/>\ntelling me what to tell you guys--lol.  She has her whole life <br/>\nplanned out already.  She says it&#39;s actually a 15-year plan, but it <br/>\nwill set up the rest of her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no family support in this so I&#39;m trying to make my own <br/>\nsupport through community.  They blame all Sean&#39;s problems on the <br/>\nfact that he isn&#39;t in school and that I spoil him.  Anyway, that&#39;s <br/>\nenough about me.  I&#39;ll be checking back here soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] introductions","postDate":"1085795527","msgId":33,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjMwMWM0NDUxZiQ4YzllOGMwMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDA1MjgyMDA0MjE0Ni4xNzAxMC40MEI3QjM0RTAwMEM1MTBCMDAwMDQyNzIyMjAwNzM1ODM0MEUwMzBFMDMwMDA0MEFAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":30,"nextInTopic":34,"prevInTime":32,"nextInTime":34,"topicId":7,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... **Hi Rebecca - I m glad you came too.
