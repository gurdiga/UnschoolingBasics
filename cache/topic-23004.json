Yes, it&#39;s typical 4 yo behavior.  My DD tried to treat <br/>\nthe pets the same as she would treat her babydolls...slung over <br/>\nshoulders/balanced on a hip, wrapped up in blankets, trying to force <br/>\nfeed them because &quot;babies&quot; need to eat, dunking then in the bathtub, <br/>\nall dressed up even in &quot;diapers&quot;, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, not all animals will be as tolerant as the one you have <br/>\nnow...in that you are lucky. In the future that might not be the <br/>\ncase...or if they try to play the same way with someone else&#39;s pet. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a parent and pet owner, I feel it is important to show little <br/>\nones how to interact with pets and how NOT to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since you said that you think your DD is doing some of it for <br/>\nyour attention, don&#39;t just give her attention...give her AND the cat <br/>\nattention.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the time to play with the cat together, pet the cat for a while <br/>\nand &quot;let&quot; the cat decide when to walk away, show/discuss how many <br/>\ndifferent appropriate ways there are to love a cat (food/water, <br/>\nshelter, litter box, petting, playing, napping, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, talk and &quot;show&quot; how NOT to treat the cat together. Sometimes <br/>\nlittle kids cannot think about the &quot;other&#39;s point of <br/>\nview/feelings&quot;...they just haven&#39;t developed that yet.  So sometimes <br/>\nwe would play the &quot;if you are...&quot; game to help our kids &quot;realize&quot; <br/>\nhow someone else feels/thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your case we would have used &quot;if you are a cat...would you like <br/>\nto be treated/handled like...?&quot;  We would ask the question and then <br/>\nbecause the behavior was &#39;laying on top of the cat&#39;, we would then <br/>\nlay on top of DD...until she &quot;meowed&quot; to be let up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst she might think the game is silly and fun, but then she&#39;ll <br/>\nrealize that it isn&#39;t pleasant for her...being &quot;trapped&quot; and all.  <br/>\nThen ask, &quot;Do you think Monty, enjoys feeling trapped they way you <br/>\ndid?&quot; to help her focus on the cat&#39;s feelings in a way a 4 yo can <br/>\neasily identify with.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have to help her the first few times you play the game...&quot;if <br/>\nyou didn&#39;t enjoy being layed on, then maybe Monty doesn&#39;t like being <br/>\nlayed on either, what do you think?&quot;  Ask things like, &quot;How can we <br/>\ntell if the cat doesn&#39;t like something?&quot; and &quot;When the cat tells us <br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, what could we do to help him feel <br/>\nbetter?&quot;  (Hope that makes sense.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk about WHY DD didn&#39;t like being &quot;trapped&quot; (hard to move/breathe, <br/>\nscary, lack of freedom, etc.)  Then talk about WHY Monty might not <br/>\nlike being layed on...DD is bigger/heavier than the cat which may be <br/>\npainful, Monty may have a hard time moving/breathing which could be <br/>\ndangerous, it could be scary for the cat, Monty&#39;s freedom is taken <br/>\naway which could cause anger, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids loved the game so much they started playing it with each <br/>\nother for a variety of things (prending to be pillows, rocks, <br/>\nanimals, people, dirt, water, foods, cars, etc.)...they&#39;ve long  <br/>\ngrown out of it, now.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOur favorite was &quot;Chicken Pillow&quot;...a feather pillow that was still <br/>\nalive, wiggling, and &quot;clucking&quot;!
