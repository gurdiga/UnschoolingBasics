Go figure. For us, we started checking for gelatin years ago,<br/>\nnot because of being veg/not wanting animal products but because we<br/>\nmade/make our own &#39;yogurt cheese&#39; by draining the whey out (via a knee<br/>\nstocking LOL - you should see the double takes when people see the knee<br/>\nhighs hanging over the sink after we rinse them out! LOL) Gelatin causes<br/>\nthe whey to stay blended in, we wanted it out. So, we&#39;d look for<br/>\nno-gelatin yogurts. And the local store brand was the best, no gelatin.<br/>\nThe alternate to gelatin is pectin but that&#39;s usually from fruit so not<br/>\na problem for those who want no animal squeezin&#39;s in their foods. A<br/>\nreally good yogurt with no gelatin (I checked) is the Greek yogurt which<br/>\nis very popular now - Chobani and Fage are two of the more popular<br/>\nbrands I&#39;ve seen. They filter/strain the whey off so it&#39;s very thick and<br/>\ncreamy and has NO gelatin in either of those brands. It&#39;s a favorite of<br/>\nmine because the fat free plain is thick and rich and less tart than<br/>\nregular yogurt (whey is a big factor in tartness, that yogurt tang) - I<br/>\nadd a spoonful of agave syrup and a healthy BAM! of cinnamon and I&#39;ve<br/>\ngot a fat free, low carb/low glycemic, decent protein, TASTY snack -<br/>\nthat&#39;s important at things like DS&#39; birthday party when our guests were<br/>\nall having cake and ice cream and that&#39;s just not a good choice for me<br/>\n(type 2 diabetes), so I made myself a favorite tasty snack to munch on<br/>\nwhile they ate cake.

I have been a<br/>\n&gt; vegetarian since<br/>\n&gt; 1993. I am modeling the vegetarian life and choices for my son. I do<br/>\n&gt; not and<br/>\n&gt; will not cook meat in my house, it is against my principles; my son and<br/>\n&gt; DH<br/>\n&gt; sometimes choose to eat meat when we are elsewhere. Why shouldn&#39;t I<br/>\n&gt; model my<br/>\n&gt; personal beliefs to my son?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You *should*. But you shouldn&#39;t impose your beliefs ON him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s only 4.5. How well can he cook fried chicken if that&#39;s what he<br/>\n&gt; wants? It&#39;s up to *you*, his mom, to provide that *for* him, if that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; what he wants and needs, even if it&#39;s not for *you*.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What if your mother had forced you to eat meat---or worse---*tricked*<br/>\n&gt; you into eating it---because she believed that eating meat was<br/>\n&gt; important in your diet. How would that have made you feel?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My older son is frequently a vegetarian (he&#39;s probably eating meat<br/>\n&gt; right now because he&#39;s in the wilds of the Yukon, and it&#39;s a<br/>\n&gt; survivalist&#39;s program: out in the wild, you eat what you can get!). I<br/>\n&gt; make every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You can eat<br/>\n&gt; vegetarian when you&#39;re out elsewhere, but *here* we eat meat!&quot;?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s not you. Treat him as he would like to be treated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Why shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself<br/>\n&gt; by explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house<br/>\n&gt; (and at 4.5<br/>\n&gt; he can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between<br/>\n&gt; real live<br/>\n&gt; animal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it<br/>\n&gt; elsewhere?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He&#39;s not getting to make *any* decision. You&#39;re making it *for* him! By<br/>\n&gt; not fixing it---or at least having it available, like the rotisserie<br/>\n&gt; chicken, or sliced meats or whatever. He gets NO say in this process.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in<br/>\n&gt; early 1994.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Fine, but now you have a child who wants meat. So maybe there needs to<br/>\n&gt; be a &quot;new&quot; decision for 2008.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Were it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the<br/>\n&gt; situation be<br/>\n&gt; different?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -==-==-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think so, but I&#39;m not religious. I have plenty of Jewish friends who<br/>\n&gt; love a good pork chop.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Who? Did I miss certain children?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To be a true unschooler, does one have to do things that are against<br/>\n&gt; one&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; principles or religious beliefs if the child requests it?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think so. They aren&#39;t the child&#39;s principles or beliefs, are they?<br/>\n&gt; Why can&#39;t the child choose? Why are his beliefs and principles less<br/>\n&gt; valid or important?

They learned <br/>\nto  make their own decisions through seeing choices their parents made, <br/>\nongoing  discussions, and trial and error.   I have changed my vocabulary to  not <br/>\ninclude the phrase.. &quot;We just don&#39;t...&quot; simply because it  limits possibilities <br/>\nthat might be amazing.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI would hate to think I had missed those hours watching &quot;Friends, That 70&#39;s  <br/>\nShow and Family Guy with them because it was more than an hour a day.  And  <br/>\nthe amazing potato guns that we made that shoot potatoes half way across  the <br/>\nriver.  And Pulp Fiction....we would have missed that too.  And  those late <br/>\nnight runs to get chocolate shakes just because I didn&#39;t like  McDonalds...would <br/>\nhave missed all that.  So many memories that we  share that make up the <br/>\nkaleidoscope of our lives are just because I got rid  of &quot;We don&#39;t do that in our <br/>\nfamily and replaced it with....&quot;Why Not?&quot;   And  &quot;Yes, let&#39;s find a way to make <br/>\nthat happen.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nJust that simple thing made their lives so much bigger and all our lives so  <br/>\nmuch richer.<br/>\n <br/>\nI certainly would have thought it someone was crazy 7 years ago if  someone <br/>\nhad said &quot;Why not let your child paint on the walls&quot;     My journey from &quot;Why <br/>\nnot watch more than one hour of TV a day&quot; to   &quot;Why not paint on the walls&quot;  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t happen  overnight .

How would that have made you feel?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older son is frequently a vegetarian (he&#39;s probably eating meat <br/>\nright now because he&#39;s in the wilds of the Yukon, and it&#39;s a <br/>\nsurvivalist&#39;s program: out in the wild, you eat what you can get!). I <br/>\nmake every effort to keep his meals vegie. What if I said, &quot;You can eat <br/>\nvegetarian when you&#39;re out elsewhere, but *here* we eat meat!&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not you. Treat him as he would like to be treated.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy shouldn&#39;t I help him make the decision himself<br/>\nby explaining why I do not eat meat and do not have it in the house <br/>\n(and at 4.5<br/>\nhe can explain where meat comes from, so he has the connection between <br/>\nreal live<br/>\nanimal and meat on the plate) but that he is quite free to eat it <br/>\nelsewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s not getting to make *any* decision. You&#39;re making it *for* him! By <br/>\nnot fixing it---or at least having it available, like the rotisserie <br/>\nchicken, or sliced meats or whatever. He gets NO say in this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe no meat in the house was something my husband and I decided in <br/>\nearly 1994.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFine, but now you have a child who wants meat. So maybe there needs to <br/>\nbe a &quot;new&quot; decision for 2008.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWere it a religious reason for abstaining from meat, would the <br/>\nsituation be<br/>\ndifferent?<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-==-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think so, but I&#39;m not religious. I have plenty of Jewish friends who <br/>\nlove a good pork chop.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe children you mention do eat meat, just not from mom.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWho? Did I miss certain children?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be a true unschooler, does one have to do things that are against <br/>\none&#39;s<br/>\nprinciples or religious beliefs if the child requests it?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think so. They aren&#39;t the child&#39;s principles or beliefs, are they? <br/>\nWhy can&#39;t the child choose? Why are his beliefs and principles less <br/>\nvalid or important? Because you, the parent, have all the power?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33891,"nextTopicId":34215}}
