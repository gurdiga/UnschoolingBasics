They <br/>\nreally do enjoy the physical rough play that their father gives them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I talked with him and broke it down into 3 pieces to try and figure out <br/>\nwhere the difficulty was.  (1) Did he understand that it was important to <br/>\nstop when someone said stop/that they were being hurt and we needed to treat <br/>\nthem the way we want to be treated?   (2) Did he, in the moment, not <br/>\nunderstand that their screaming or groaning meant &quot;stop&quot;?   (3) Was he <br/>\nunable to physically stop even though he understood #1 and #2?   He said he <br/>\nthought it was #3.  Good in that  at least he&#39;s gotten through the first <br/>\ncouple steps, but not so good in that the other 2 seem easier to teach.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you talked to your younger child about using his words to communicate <br/>\nclearly as well?  There is more than one person in this situation.

I will then  step in and simply state that i&#39;ve heard the <br/>\nword stop.  Its not done in anger or judgement - just a helpful reminding <br/>\nvoice - kind of like oh hand me the ketchup please.

(Of course,<br/>\nthey know if this doesn&#39;t work that they can come to me but I do ask<br/>\nthem to try to do it themselves first.)  This has done several things<br/>\nfor us:<br/>\n1.

I&#39;ve even seen one accidentally hit the other, run to the freezer<br/>\nand get an ice pack (that stays on for all of 10 seconds at best) and<br/>\napologize right away.

It really gives them a sense of power - and not in a bad way but<br/>\nthink about it...when adults allow kids to tattle, those kids feel<br/>\npowerless to fix the problem themselves and always bring in a 3rd<br/>\nparty.  If we encourage them to stand up for themselves at a young age<br/>\nwith a safe subject (siblings), I feel they&#39;ll be much better prepared<br/>\nfor life.

(I have 3 boys also, 10, 7, and 4.)  What I&#39;ve found most helpful is letting them know that I am there to help them communicate more effectively.  To say, &quot;You seem really frustrated because you want to play with that toy (or whatever I sense the issue is).  Let&#39;s see if we can solve this problem.&quot;  And then to talk through the problem with them.  Oh, and also to *be there* -- present, in the midst of whatever&#39;s going on so that I can step in between (if possible, sometimes he&#39;s too fast and I don&#39;t see it coming) before the hitting happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe aggression has gotten better.  Of course, I want it to stop once and for all, but I can see it&#39;s improving.  But punishment doesn&#39;t really do that either.  They really need us to teach them, model for them, alternatives to hitting.  It takes a long time, and a lot of help, for some children to learn how to &quot;use your words&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            *****The consequence would be that it hurts to be hit or that your brother <br/>\n<br/>\nwon&#39;t play with you because he&#39;s afraid of being hit again.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is said each and every time.
