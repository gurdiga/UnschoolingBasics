Every week... summer, fall, winter, spring, and<br/>\nsummer again, I&#39;ve  made trip after trip from the feed store down the road<br/>\nto our house, filling up our water tank & hauling 250 gallons at a time back<br/>\nhere to the house, to take care of our household needs.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWhen you live beyond the sidewalks and the county water lines, sometimes you<br/>\ndo what you have to do. WE have learned to be &quot;water misers&quot; and make do<br/>\nwith low water pressure, quick showers, and fewer flushes. Lots of fun!\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t always this way, but it hasn&#39;t been MUCH  better...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI had rigged up a &quot;temporary&quot; pump in our well for the first six years we<br/>\nwere here, which enabled us to pump H20 up to a 55 gallon barrel... and then<br/>\nsiphon it by water hose down to cistern behind our house. Hardly an<br/>\nefficient system, especially in cold weather, when my hands would freeze<br/>\nalong with everything else and the whole system would lock up as tight as an<br/>\nice drum.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nWell, my &quot;temporary&quot; (HA HA) set up blew a gasket last summer, and ever<br/>\nsince then -- inbetween putting out newsletters and hauling loads of H2O --<br/>\nwe&#39;ve tried to get someone out here to help install a really, truly, honest<br/>\nto goodness\r<br/>\ndeep well pump for us so we could have REAL water and REAL water pressure in<br/>\nthe house.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nBut we found this isn&#39;t easy out here in the boonies... and it isn&#39;t cheap,<br/>\neither.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nFirst you have to dig the water line trench from the pump to the house and<br/>\nlay your line...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThen you dig out a huge hole for a well house...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThen you build the &quot;in the ground&quot; cement and cinder block well house...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nand then Finally, you install the deep well pump and hook it all up!\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAll this takes time & patience, big guys with backhoes & cement mixers...<br/>\nand money.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nProvidentially, after 11 months of searching and waiting, this past two<br/>\nweeks we were able to have our trench dug...water line laid... a hole dug<br/>\nout for our well house... foundation poured... AND our well house actually<br/>\nBUILT.  Blessings all!\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nThe only thing left now is to buy our pressure tank & switch box, and then<br/>\nget our pump guy over here to set the pump, hook it all up, and turn on the<br/>\nspigot...\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n...And then find a way to pay for all of this activity.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nI tell you all the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; story to explain why we&#39;ve decided to<br/>\nmake our\r<br/>\nHOMESCHOOL RESOURCE FIRESALE available one last time -- and that is to\r<br/>\nraise the funds we need to pay for all these blessings.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nSo, here you go...
