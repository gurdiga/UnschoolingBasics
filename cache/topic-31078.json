Ask them to help you locate any credible source of proof that unschooling is ineffective. This solves at least two problems: 1. it keeps them busy and out of your hair, and 2. it will by default help educate them on unschooling. Now I must admit my wife did not fall for it and recognized immediately what my strategy was, but her defiance and her excuse not to do it showed me that deep down she really must trust my decision to unschool since she doesn&#39;t stand in my way of doing it and what little resistance she does show is really just testing me to see if I really know what I&#39;m talking about. It also leaves the door open for her to say she told me so if ever there is a problem with unschooling, but we all here know that ain&#39;t gonna happen. So she and I are at a cease fire level right now, which is fine by me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Christi &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:christi@...\">christi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 18, 2008 12:35:32 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] New to the Group:)<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a WAH & HS mom of 3 children- 7,12, and 14.
