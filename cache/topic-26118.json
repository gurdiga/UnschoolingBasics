I often feel like a tourist in a foreign country, and <br/>\nin that sense, I usually find it amusing and fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when it&#39;s meanness to their kids, it just makes me very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of many many examples: I was at Breakfast with Santa last <br/>\nDecember with my three children. A lady I didn&#39;t know, sitting by me, <br/>\nwas nice enough to hold my baby while I got myself and the other two <br/>\nkids fed. She was very nice and pleasant. I asked her about her <br/>\nchildren, and she introduced me to one child. Then she said her two <br/>\nyear old had to stay home because she was being difficult, or <br/>\ndisobedient, or something, at bedtime the night before.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt made me feel kind of sad and sick. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on with stories like that. I guess we all could.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my reaction varies. This particular woman seemed quite <br/>\npleased and confident with her decsion, she was a total stranger, and <br/>\nshe was helping me out, so I didn&#39;t address it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works best for me is to take opportunities to tap into <br/>\nfrustrations that are already there. For example, someone was telling <br/>\nme about putting their kids in Time Out. I said, &quot;Oh, does that <br/>\nhelp?&quot; She immediately said, &quot;No.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nOr I might say, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve found that what helps when my child acts <br/>\nlike that is to ____.&quot; That&#39;s is the person seems frustrated. If they <br/>\nseem confident in what they&#39;re doing, I&#39;m more likely to either <br/>\nignore it or ask sort of innocent questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as on-line homeschool (and not unschool) groups, I don&#39;t think <br/>\nI have any use for them. I visted one recently that I thought might <br/>\nbe appropriate for me. One post said that when their child won&#39;t be <br/>\ntheir &quot;schoolwork,&quot; they will make them scrub all the toilets, saying <br/>\nto them, &quot;If you don&#39;t do your math, when you&#39;re an adult you&#39;ll be <br/>\nscrubbing other people&#39;s toilets.&quot; Others replied that that was <br/>\nclever and great!<br/>\n<br/>\nI see no reason for me to be there. Discussions like that won&#39;t help <br/>\nme, and I&#39;m doubt I would help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":220041937,"authorName":"hbmccarty","from":"hbmccarty &lt;hbmccarty@...&gt;","profile":"heather13068","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Yikes - reality check!","postDate":"1189512147","msgId":26138,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2RTY4M0QzLjIwODAyMDlAdHdjbnkucnIuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZjNGtxaisxMGMxMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGZjNGtxaisxMGMxMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26137,"nextInTopic":26150,"prevInTime":26137,"nextInTime":26139,"topicId":26118,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

However, people can see that my kids are <br/>\n&quot;turning out&quot;, and they can see that I am not forcing them to do these <br/>\nthings or behave in anyway, but they still can&#39;t make the connection <br/>\nbetween how they are treated and how they are. They think they are just <br/>\nthe kinds of kids who just happen to do well with unschooling, while <br/>\ntheir own kids are different and need to be told what to do, or they <br/>\nwould do &quot;nothing&quot; all day and misbehave. I guess I don&#39;t mind that <br/>\npeople just insist that my kids are great, because I happen to agree, <br/>\nbut it is a little frustrating when I can&#39;t make it clear that all kids <br/>\ncould be like that- enthusiastic and committed to what they are doing <br/>\nand respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have actually started to think that in my particular area, it might be <br/>\na bad thing for my kids for me to be an advocate for unschooling, as it <br/>\nsets them aside as different from families and kids they would like to <br/>\nfit in with. The schooled people we know know very little of what we do, <br/>\nand around school at home families I, at this point, almost (but not <br/>\nquite) wish that I had kept our lifestyle more quiet. I fear that it may <br/>\nmake some parents wary of letting their kids be close to ours. The no <br/>\nlimits on &quot;screens&quot; is, I think, a hard one for many to stomach.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often tell stories of how for example, my kids learned to read on <br/>\ntheir own, when the subject of reading comes up. I tell people who ask <br/>\nabout all the interesting things my kids do, or about how our <br/>\nrelationship has improved since I read this book, or read that website, <br/>\nwhatever(this is a simplification, of course, as it is not one thing.)  <br/>\nSometimes I think parents would prefer someone to complain with though, <br/>\nrather than hear how it is better or easier in my family or could be <br/>\nbetter in theirs. It is easier to make it the kids fault than to take <br/>\nresponsibility for how things aren&#39;t so good in your family and make a <br/>\nchange.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the relationship is what is always important, rather than me <br/>\nproving I am right.  If people see I am a kind and reasonable person <br/>\nfirst, then discover  other things about our family as it comes out <br/>\nthrough conversation, then that works better.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Yikes - reality check!","postDate":"1189490618","msgId":26137,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwOTEwMjMwM3QyYTk0YzEzOXJjMTVmMzNiYjBjZGRlZWI5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc1MzUwYTJjMDcwOTEwMjIxN3Y0ZDE3NTExNHIxNTRjNmVhMDEyMmJiYWEzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwOTEwMTM0OHk1MWNiOGQ5N3RjMzkwNWIyZjk3ZmVhNjVhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGZjNGtxaisxMGMxMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JIDw3NTM1MGEyYzA3MDkxMDIyMTd2NGQxNzUxMTRyMTU0YzZlYTAxMjJiYmFhM0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26136,"nextInTopic":26138,"prevInTime":26136,"nextInTime":26138,"topicId":26118,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Part of me was furious at this James Dobson<br/>\nperson for writing such crappy advice and touting it to desperate parents,<br/>\npart of me was angry at this couple for not thinking about what they were<br/>\ndoing or being able to see how awful it was, and part of me was feeling<br/>\nextremely sad for their son.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore they left I managed to croak out, &quot;We steer away from philosophies<br/>\nthat advocate spanking&quot; which seemed to surprise them a bit but wasn&#39;t<br/>\nreally earth-shaking and not a tenth of what I really wanted to say. When I<br/>\ngot home I looked up the James Dobson book and found a page about it at<br/>\nstoptherod.com - and it was every bit as horrible as I&#39;d feared.

I get really bent when I see moms in public <br/>\nor in my neighborhood being so tough on their kids. When any kids are at my <br/>\nhouse, they get some unschooling. It is nice to be able to see kids getting <br/>\nsome freedoms that don&#39;t get elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I went to a neighbors to borrow some flour and their daughter was <br/>\nin trouble. The mother brought me into the conversation and humiliated her <br/>\ndaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if I could see her room. This girl is very good friends with my <br/>\ndaughter and I was telling her how similar our houses were built. She <br/>\nhappily invited me up even though her mothers face looked stressed about the <br/>\nidea. Her room was a disaster. I noticed a trophy on the floor and asked her <br/>\nabout it. We discussed a beautiful pillow had Aunt made for her. We talked <br/>\nfor a good 15 minutes sitting in the mess. We just plopped down on her <br/>\nmattress and I listened mostly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I was leaving her mom walked me out and thanked me for talking to her <br/>\ndaughter because she seemed so much more calm now.

The <br/>\nmom had so much respect for her children, and all four of our kids got <br/>\nalong SO well. It was beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am often quite amazed at what parents will say and do and truly <br/>\nbelieve it is rational and will help the situation. Not only unkind <br/>\nthings but completely nonsensical. I try to remember sometimes that that <br/>\nwas me once(and still can be in a confused moment). I really do need to <br/>\npreserve relationships with other parents for the sake of my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bother me the most are families that says they are unschooling, and <br/>\nthen proceed to speak about their kids in such a negative way, so <br/>\ndisappointed with what the kids spend their time doing (playing video <br/>\ngames, usually), rather than really taking the time to see what they are <br/>\ndoing, and angry with them for not doing things such as remembering to <br/>\npack their own lunch (I guess the parent thinks that unschooled kids are <br/>\nsupposed to always be responsible for their own needs and that they will <br/>\nlearn from going hungry?  I see it as my job to make sure they have what <br/>\nthey need, and if they decide to do it themselves, then great, and they <br/>\nwill-  my mom isn&#39;t making my lunches anymore, though my grandmother was <br/>\nmaking lunch for my uncle when he was 30(he wasn&#39;t unschooled).) I <br/>\nrecommend Sandra and Joyce&#39;s websites often. I suppose these families <br/>\nare unschooling in some way but it stops after reading and math, and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem very fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to only say what my experience is as I don&#39;t want to seem <br/>\nannoying, and as I said, these are parents of my kid&#39;s friends and I <br/>\ncan&#39;t afford to alienate, though I am afraid I do just by being myself <br/>\nand being positive and excited about my kids, rather than grumpy and <br/>\ncomplaining. I think they might think I just have exceptional kids and <br/>\nare resentful of this.  Often just keeping the subject on something else <br/>\nentirely or knitting is the only way to cope.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading unschooling lists has become more important to me, though maybe <br/>\nsomeday I can go to a conference and see some real faces.

(and it has really stuck with me to this day).<br/>\n<br/>\nI quit the local homeschooling lists I was on - I saw many comments like the ones you posted.  The manipulative and domineering attitudes just sicked me.  I also cringe inwardedly whenever I&#39;m outside, as our neighborhood - and the one before it - are solely comprised of parents who are either completely authoritarian and/or neglectful.  The kids all gravitate to dh and me since we are out and involved with Tristan (ds), and their parents are no where to be seen for hours and hours.  That is, except, when they poke their heads out their doors to scream at their kids.  Tristan has a good friend who is constantly in trouble.  This boy was grounded from all video games because one night he was ten minutes late getting a shower and fixing his school lunch for the next day.  One day his mom also threw out his Nintendo DS and all games because he failed to clean his room.  This boy tries so hard to stay at our house as often and as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne comment I read recently, however, has really stuck with me.  A neighbor was talking about one of her daughters.  The night previously the little girl had corrected the her about something the she had said.  The mom relayed her displeasure by telling my next door neighbor, &quot;She doesn&#39;t know anything.  I&#39;M the adult.  She&#39;s just a kid.  They don&#39;t know anything.&quot;  And this was in hearing range of the child. (it shouldn&#39;t have been said at all, but....ggrrr...)  I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all, but my son has corrected me more times than I can count, and guess what?  He was absolutely right, and I was in the wrong.  Why can&#39;t people see that a child&#39;s view is just as valid as their own or, heaven forbid, that they may be knowledgeable about something the parent is not? *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so thankful for this list and unschooling in general.  It has given me such insight and has really opened my eyes to a whole new (wonderful!) world for my family, but at the same time it just breaks my heart to see how so many other families live.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalinda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210335840,"authorName":"Susan","from":"Susan &lt;SusanYvonne@...&gt;","profile":"taodesuki","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Yikes - reality check!","postDate":"1189396970","msgId":26118,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwOTA5MjEwMmw5YTAzODk3bDg1MTAyNDcwOTEwNGY2YzZAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26119,"prevInTime":26117,"nextInTime":26119,"topicId":26118,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just got back from the Live & Learn conference (had an awesome time!!) and decided to check my email to see what discussions I ve missed over the past week.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1290405018\">I just got back from the Live & Learn conference (had an awesome time!!) and<br/>\ndecided to check my email to see what discussions I&#39;ve missed over the past<br/>\nweek. One posting on a statewide homeschooling list caught my eye - a mom<br/>\nwrote that she&#39;s concerned her daughter is being selfish and spoiled. The<br/>\noriginal posting and the many responses that followed (I stopped reading<br/>\nafter the first few) just seemed to GLARE off the page at me in big neon<br/>\nletters. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m still riding on a conference high or because<br/>\nI just spent a week in a big unschooling bubble, but the heartless and<br/>\nmanipulative flavor of the comments really struck a chord in me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey probably wouldn&#39;t have had quite the same impact on me two or three<br/>\nyears ago, not because I would have agreed with their approach, but because<br/>\nthe view expressed in these comments seemed like such a &quot;normal&quot; attitude to<br/>\nhave towards children. Reading just that one thread about the so-called<br/>\n&quot;selfish&quot; daughter, I could see a lot of negative emotion being felt about<br/>\nchildren. It occurs to me how prevalent and perfectly acceptable this<br/>\nattitude is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really powerful indicator of how far down the RU path I&#39;ve come for<br/>\nme to read the comments like the ones below and have such an intense<br/>\nheart/gut reaction to them. I&#39;m ready to quit the list and pretend that<br/>\nworld doesn&#39;t exist, la lala la la lala (fingers in ears, I can&#39;t hear<br/>\nyou!). Has anyone else had this type of reaction? I&#39;ve been on this<br/>\nparticular list for years but it&#39;s never quite repulsed me in this way<br/>\nbefore. I know it hasn&#39;t changed, it&#39;s me who&#39;s different, which I&#39;m<br/>\nabsolutely delighted about but at the same time I&#39;m saddened to now have the<br/>\nability to see how ugly the traditional parenting world can be.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I can&#39;t be at special places like L&L everyday, I am more thankful<br/>\nthan ever to come home to the RU lists, where I am challenged to be a better<br/>\nparent everyday. It&#39;s much better than stewing in this kind of ick and<br/>\nallowing myself to accept/allow these type of harmful attitudes toward my<br/>\nkids (or anyone else&#39;s kids for that matter). In light of the type of<br/>\ncomments and discussions on regular lists, it&#39;s extremely refreshing to be<br/>\npresent for the conversations here. Thanks to everyone who has provided a<br/>\nplethora of ideas for me to think about, new (and improved!) tools for my<br/>\nparenting basket, and has said just what I needed to hear, even when your<br/>\npost wasn&#39;t directed at me.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Susan<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3 separate comments that really twisted me up inside:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy step-daughter Jess was very materialistic, and spoiled absolutely rotten.<br/>\n Whatever she wanted, she got, as long as her parents had the money for it.<br/>\nI got the opportunity to show her the value of what she already had when we<br/>\nhad a battle of wills over her cleaning her room.  I told her that if it<br/>\nwasn&#39;t done by 9:00 Thursday morning, I was going to clean it myself, and I<br/>\nclean with a lot of garbage bags.  She didn&#39;t believe me. So when she got<br/>\nhome from after-school stuff that evening, her room was spotless.  She was<br/>\namazed, and thanked me profusely for cleaning it for her.  She was quite<br/>\nhappy, until she went to look for a CD, couldn&#39;t find it, and asked me where<br/>\nit was.  &quot;In the garbage.&quot;  Her other CD&#39;s?  In the garbage.  The clothes<br/>\nthat were piled all over the place? Garbage. Everything that wasn&#39;t put away<br/>\nneatly was in the garbage.<br/>\n<br/>\n&#39;NEEDS&#39; vs &#39;wants&#39;. I started trying to teach my cousins the difference many<br/>\nmany years ago (they are 5 and 10 years my junior). I always heard them say,<br/>\n&quot;But I need a that new dress&quot;. I would say, they WANT it because all they<br/>\nNEED is something that will keep them alive (water, food, you know).
