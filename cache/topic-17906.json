Ben used to sell food to <br/>\nrestaurants, so we knew the owners. We were also regular customers. <br/>\nThey needed help. Cameron applied. They would take him back in a <br/>\nheartbeat. He was one of their best workers. A clean-freak! &lt;G&gt; They <br/>\npaid him under the table until he was legally old enough to work there.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Next he worked for a caterer---again, someone we knew. Again, their <br/>\nbest worker.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He left there as a full time employee and worked only two days/week <br/>\nbecause he got a job delivering a local paper. Again---best worker! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  He volunteered at the local independent movie theatre for a year. Then <br/>\none of the managers left for five months to go to Australia. Cam was <br/>\nhired to temporarily replace him until he recently came back.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He started his own pet-sitting service. He still does this and has <br/>\nover a dozen very regular clients. He stays overnight in their homes <br/>\nand cares for the animals and plants, etc. This is by far his biggest <br/>\nsource of $$$.<br/>\n<br/>\n  For years he has gone to &quot;Open Mike Night&quot; at two bars in town. I had <br/>\nto go with him to get him in until they knew him and knew he was <br/>\nserious. At 17, he was a regular. At 18, one of the clubs hired him as <br/>\nthe house band&#39;s drummer (Fatback and the Groove Band). He&#39;s a <br/>\nprofessional musician now! &lt;G&gt; He plays blues, jazz, and old pop.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The band he formed (Half Moon Blessing---check out their MySpace) has <br/>\nhad two paying gigs and are looking for more. They need a longer set. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n He plays the drums 4-6 hours each day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He was recently asked to work for a guy (family friend of the <br/>\ngirlfriend) who needs a driver for his business. We&#39;re not quite sure <br/>\nwhat he&#39;ll be doing, but it&#39;s $10-11/hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He also has been helping a friend with some serious <br/>\nremodeling---scraping popcorn ceilings, landscaping, cleaning, painting <br/>\ninside & out. THis friend is also a *TALKATIVE* sociology professor at <br/>\nthe university. Essentially, he&#39;s paying Cam $10/hour to lecture him <br/>\nabout sociology. Cam LOVES it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Most of his friends are in college or have an apartment. I&#39;ve told him <br/>\nwe would be happy to help him move out (pay first month, furnish with <br/>\nwhat we have in storage, etc.), but he&#39;d rather keep saving for a newer <br/>\ncar (that can fit his drums!) and have $$ to spend on the girlfriend. <br/>\nHe helped pay for NBTSCamp and the upcoming Drumming Collective (in NYC <br/>\nin November) with the $$ he&#39;s made and saved. His car is paid for, but <br/>\nhe covers his insurance and gas and repairs, etc. At 18, I think that&#39;s <br/>\nenough.<br/>\n<br/>\n He&#39;s pretty generous with his $$, but he *really* likes to save it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  He could *be* more independent, but we&#39;ve suggested that he keep <br/>\nworking and keep saving and keep living with us. If he puts the time <br/>\nand effort into his drumming these next four years that his friends are <br/>\nin college, he&#39;ll be *more* prepared than they will! &lt;G&gt; He makes <br/>\nenough $$ that he *could* live on his own, but that&#39;s not the meager <br/>\nexistence I want for him. I&#39;d rather his life be rich and abundant. I <br/>\ncan still give that to him. I don&#39;t want him to think of himself as a <br/>\n&quot;starving artist.&quot; He can be *just* as good a musician with a full <br/>\nstomach and a warm, dry home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have NO doubts he will make it alone. He could do it now.

This is another one of those <br/>\nquestions that isn&#39;t necessary for you to answer on the list but to ponder <br/>\nyourself.  Is your son at risk of being self destructive?   Are you thinking <br/>\nrationally or are you letting fear take hold of you?   Is living with fear <br/>\nconstructive or destructive?<br/>\n<br/>\n***Do I just let my son continue whatever direction he&#39;s going, even if<br/>\nit&#39;s leading him down a path the I see as not too great for him?***<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, your son is playing computer games, he&#39;s not organizing hookers and <br/>\ngambling rings or stealing cars.   Try to keep your perspective.<br/>\nGames.   He is not doing anything destructive and instead of trying to <br/>\nchange his direction you could go there with him.  Then you might see it is <br/>\nnot the road to hell, it&#39;s a young man&#39;s interest.  An interest he shares <br/>\nwith many other people who are just fine.   Join him!  Your fears will <br/>\nsubside.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what else is available to him?   Does he have choices about what to do <br/>\nwith his time.  Can he go see friends?  Can he go to the book stores or <br/>\nmuseums or art galleries or gaming shops?  Can he watch TV or movies?   Can <br/>\nhe have friends over?  Can he spend time with you?  Can he go places and <br/>\nmeet people?   Could he join a club or group if he wanted - rock climbing or <br/>\nski club or karate?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he has many choices and he&#39;s choosing computer games then he&#39;s doing what <br/>\nhe wants to do right now.   If the computer is his only or best choice then <br/>\n*you* are not doing enough to make his world big and interesting.  That is <br/>\nnot a fault with your child and not a problem with the computer.  If the <br/>\ncomputer is his only choice and you take it away from him what do you leave <br/>\nhim with?   Resentment, boredom, loneliness.   If the computer is his best <br/>\nchoice then he&#39;d be a fool not to use it.

I keep wanting Aaron to fit MY picture of what he should<br/>\nbe doing (I do try to control these impulses outwardly, I&#39;m just<br/>\ndescribing the conflict that is going on inside of me).***<br/>\n<br/>\nHe needs time to heal from the injuries of school.  You&#39;ve probably read<br/>\nabout deschooling.  Some people have talked about one month of deschooling<br/>\nfor every year the child was in school but I&#39;ve never thought that was<br/>\nenough.  Maybe I&#39;m slow. &lt;G&gt;  I think it&#39;s possible or even likely some or<br/>\neven lots of kids take much longer to heal. (that was messy but I hope you <br/>\nknow what I mean.)<br/>\n<br/>\nResist letting your concerns spill out onto him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe with him as much as he wants you to be.   Take an interest<br/>\nin whatever he&#39;s doing.  Sit down with him while he&#39;s on the computer and<br/>\ntry to see it from his perspective.  He&#39;s getting something out of it he<br/>\nneeds right now.  Let that comfort you.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I guess I&#39;m looking for some moral support from other parents,<br/>\nparticularly from parents with teens... particularly from parents<br/>\nwho have perhaps not been unschooling from &quot;day one&quot; and perhaps<br/>\nhave experienced some of this conflict.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the mom of a teen boy.  Dylan is fourteen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Aaron is doing today is not all he&#39;ll ever do.  Relax your whole body<br/>\nand tell yourself that.  Let is settle.  He might very well always like<br/>\ncomputers.  They&#39;re common household and work place appliances and all of us<br/>\non this list have at least some interest in them. &lt;g&gt;  He might not always<br/>\nhave the deep interest he has today but if he does, that might lead him to a<br/>\njob or hobby he loves and isn&#39;t part of your hope for him that he will find<br/>\nwhat he loves to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople have changing interests their whole lives long.   A parent may not be <br/>\nable to<br/>\nsee where her kid&#39;s interest might end or if it doesn&#39;t end where it might<br/>\ntake him but that doesn&#39;t lessen the value of his experience today.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t always have to understand what our kids are getting from their<br/>\ninterests.   But in loving our kids and in respecting their intelligence we<br/>\ncan get comfortable knowing they are pursuing something that&#39;s important to<br/>\nthem.   Your son&#39;s reasons for loving the computer right now aren&#39;t less<br/>\nimportant than your reasons for loving your job, or sewing or carpentry - or <br/>\nwhatever your passion<br/>\nmight be.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not all he&#39;ll ever be.   Haven&#39;t some of his interests changed since <br/>\nhe was three?  Since he was seven?  Since he was ten?<br/>\nDo you fear he will be thirty five and still at home with you on the <br/>\ncomputer? &lt;g&gt;  It sounds kind of silly, but a lot of people have those <br/>\nfeelings.  The &quot;what about when he&#39;s twenty&quot; feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan nursed until he was four.   Lots of kids nurse longer but no one who <br/>\nknew us ever knew a child to nurse as long as four years.  I would hear <br/>\nthose irrational fear based questions from friends and family: &quot;What are you <br/>\ngoing to do when he&#39;s still nursing at eighteen?&quot;   I would say, &quot;Get a <br/>\nbigger rocking chair.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could only see two possibilities.  Either I stop him from nursing or he <br/>\nwould never stop.  Either I do this or he will never do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so always remember that there are more possibilities than *Either you <br/>\nstop your son from playing on the computer or he will never do anything <br/>\nelse. *<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the possibility that he will play until he&#39;s finished.  There is <br/>\nthe possibility that his enjoyment will lead to a joyful hobby or career. <br/>\nThere is the possibility that through his play he will find other interests. <br/>\nThere is the possibility, if you embrace his interest too, your relationship <br/>\nwill grow and strengthen.  There is the possibility he&#39;ll lose interest and <br/>\nmove on to something else in a year.  The possibilities are endless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Unlike many who post here,<br/>\nI am not completely opposed to traditional schooling for some kids,<br/>\nas flawed as it is. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in a fairly happy school scenario kids can but injured in ways that<br/>\ndon&#39;t always show on the surface.   This isn&#39;t a school bashing list but the<br/>\nsimple fact most parents willingly comply with the law and separate from<br/>\ntheir very little children to let them be with strangers for three or six<br/>\nhours a day is evidence that school alters our judgment and undermines our<br/>\nconfidence in ways we aren&#39;t aware of many years later as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\n***One more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond...<br/>\nwhat do your teenage unschoolers do during their days? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only people who respond to you on this list will be the ones who want<br/>\nto. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is making his way through several screenwriting books he&#39;s purchased<br/>\nrecently or received as gifts.

It sort of irritated him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nThe one he&#39;s reading now is &quot;Elements of Style for Screenwriters&quot; by Paul <br/>\nArgentini. He&#39;s interested in<br/>\nscreenwriting and directing.  He watches movies and pays attention to the<br/>\ndirecting style, camera angles, etc.  He watches a couple of movies a day, <br/>\nlately.   He<br/>\nresearches directors and movies online.  He&#39;s interested in camera angles<br/>\nand film techniques.  He watches documentaries about film making and film<br/>\nmakers.   He reads books about these things he&#39;s interested in.  He&#39;s <br/>\nreading Stephen King&#39;s &quot;Danse Macabre.&quot;<br/>\nHe listens to jazz.  He pays attention to politics and<br/>\ninternational news.  He subscribes to and reads a weekly political magazine. <br/>\nHe likes comedy and watches a couple of political<br/>\ncomedy shows.  He&#39;s reading Howard Zinn&#39;s &quot;A People&#39;s History of the United <br/>\nStates.&quot;<br/>\nHe&#39;s reading &quot;The Year of the Angry Rabbit&quot; by Russell Braddon - an odd <br/>\npolitical humor/horror story.<br/>\nHe splits kindling for his grandmother three or four times a<br/>\nweek.  He draws cartoons.  He&#39;s working on an idea for a line of dark humor<br/>\ngreeting cards.   He&#39;s away on a road trip with his aunt, into Alberta and<br/>\nBritish Columbia right now.  He likes to stay up late and sometimes all <br/>\nnight.  He likes to walk at night so we go for a walk after dark every night <br/>\nwith few exceptions.  He&#39;s annoyed by the curfew laws that say he can&#39;t be <br/>\nout alone after ten oclock.  He likes to hike so we go hiking at least once <br/>\na week.   He hangs out at the bookstore one day a week and visits with the <br/>\nowners and with the local &quot;Character&quot; to talk about politics and social <br/>\nissues.

She watched her friends go off to High School and missed all the excitement of entering ninth grade. Now she is dealing with the fact that we are moving, which she does not want to do. Nevertheless, she has no interest in going back to school. Since I joined this list, I have found it within me to back off thinking I need to &quot;do&quot; anything to get her to &quot;do anything&quot; that meets anyone&#39;s criteria of whats &quot;constructive&quot; other than her own. I am on another list that is for homeschoolers and the ideas there are quite different than the ones here. <br/>\nHow does she spend her days? Sleeping. She stays up all night, and I mean all night, reading or manipulating photos in photoshop. She has read three books in the last two days. We are taking a Digital Photography class at the local community college (meets one night a week)  and now she wants to learn to SCUBA dive. I am so excited about that!! I can&#39;t wait!!<br/>\nOne thing that helps me see things differently is to keep my records in what someone called &quot;educationese&quot; or something to that effect. I downloaded some free software called HomeschoolTracker and I use it. I keep a reading list, enter field trips, make &quot;assignments&quot; out of stuff she does, for example if she says she read for three hours I enter it into the &quot;Free Reading&quot; assignments section. The software keeps track of all the hours spent doing things and when you look at the overview you see just how much &quot;nothing&quot; your kid is actually doing. And for some reason it satisfies the naysayers in my life. I showed it to my mother and now she is off my back about the whole thing. Funny how when you call something an &quot;assignment&quot; it takes on a whole new connotation. As if doing things you are told to do is somehow learning but doing things voluntarily is not. What a joke. And a sick one at that. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;lpodietz&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lpodietz@...\">lpodietz@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty new to this list, and to unschooling, having just begun <br/>\nthis endeavor with my son in his 8th grade year. I have been <br/>\nlurking here, following discussions, trying to gain pearls of wisdom <br/>\nto help me open my mind to this very different way of thinking. <br/>\nAaron (ds) led us to unschooling (he was unwilling and unable to put <br/>\nup with school any longer, and our research of options led us here--<br/>\nit was the ONLY option that made sense to Aaron)... it was not <br/>\nsomething that I would have chosen for my children without having <br/>\nbeen &quot;backed into the corner&quot; that we found ourselves in with Aaron, <br/>\nbecause I work, I love to work and financially speaking, I need to <br/>\nwork. Nevertheless, here I find myself, with an older daughter in <br/>\n11th grade in public school, flourishing and happy and completely <br/>\noverloaded with work and pressure unbefitting to any human being.... <br/>\nyet she handles it and by &quot;normal&quot; standards is very successful... <br/>\nand Aaron who looks at school as a complete waste of time (he has <br/>\nalways been wise beyond his years), and who is compelled towards <br/>\nthis very different approach, and completely and totally relieved <br/>\nthat he never has to go back to that awful, absurd place called <br/>\nschool (unless he chooses to).<br/>\nAnd then there&#39;s me, who runs a very busy home-based business, who <br/>\nworks long hours (I am the chief bread-winner of the family...my <br/>\nhusband is a Middle School science teacher), and who feels very <br/>\nconflicted, stressed out, worried that I really can&#39;t give Aaron the <br/>\nattention that he deserves and needs as he embarks on this new <br/>\njourney. I find myself many times a day wanting to get him off the <br/>\ncomputer, to get him to do something &quot;constructive&quot;... my mind <br/>\nunderstands what unschooling is all about, but my automatic impulses <br/>\nare quite strong and intact, and I have yet to find my trust in this <br/>\nprocess.

Unlike many who post here, <br/>\nI am not completely opposed to traditional schooling for some kids, <br/>\nas flawed as it is. It definitely works for my daughter, and as I <br/>\nmentioned in another post, I couldn&#39;t pay her to leave school. My <br/>\nhusband teaches very poor, inner city kids, whose parents do not <br/>\nhave the luxury of unschooling their children, who are barely <br/>\ngetting by, and whose kids desperately need a caring role model. <br/>\nSchool, as dysfunctional as it is, may be the only place where they <br/>\nexperience a spark of hope. Some families for whom I have the <br/>\nutmost respect and admiration send their children to public school, <br/>\nand their kids are curious, full of life and brilliant, each in <br/>\ntheir own way. I just don&#39;t think there are any absolutes in this <br/>\nworld, and there is much to be learned in every situation.<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m led down this new road by my wise, independent-thinking, <br/>\nwonderful son, and I&#39;m having trouble letting go of the reigns and <br/>\nof my old way of thinking. Something in me doesn&#39;t WANT to let go <br/>\n(yes, my kids will tell you I&#39;m a control freak)... yet I know that <br/>\nI need to.<br/>\nOne more thing I&#39;d like to ask of anyone who wants to respond... <br/>\nwhat do your teenage unschoolers do during their days?

I was going to sign her up for piano lessons that she real wants, but as I work 4-12 and she&#39;s in school 7-3, I can&#39;t get her there.  (weekends, she&#39;s at her mom&#39;s and she refuses.

Grandma even offer to pay for classes and her older sister, my daughter, offered to drive her her the lessons.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Her Dad and Mom said no if she continued to fail her classes.  Piano lessons are a privilege not a right.  One earns privileges.   Hummm.

So it&#39;s not that it&#39;s too hard  She is twice as smart as her class on the standardized testing yet average IQ they say.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Lately, I&#39;ve sat down with her and told her, all her father can do is make the next four years miserable for all of us.  She can comply and he will give her freedom, or she can refuse and she&#39;ll be free when she&#39;s of age.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I told her I see it differently.  My oldest, is taking classes I never had in college.  This is their time to learn to fly and still have us as their safety net.  I am here to help her discover and become what she would like to be whatever that is.  I can&#39;t do it for her.  I can only help.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Needless to say, very frustrating.         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nStay in the know. Pulse on the new Yahoo.com.

I just pulled them out of school. I do not have a teenager <br/>\nbut a 8yr old daughter and a 5yr son.  But I am struggling <br/>\nwith &quot;wrapping my head around&quot; the whole unschooling thing.  When I <br/>\nread about it I understand and it makes a ton of sense.  But we are <br/>\nso programed by the &#39;system&#39; that public school is the right way to <br/>\ndo things.  I know it works for a lot of kids out there but it also <br/>\nfails a lot of kids.  It is so hard to trust that the kids will be <br/>\nOK when they are not being forced to do math sheets and to follow a <br/>\ncurriculum.  That they will, on their own time, eventually find a <br/>\npassion for learning and run with it. I have recently met a mother <br/>\nwho took her son out of school at age 10.  It took him 9 months to <br/>\ndeschool(play, do nothing, etc..) Now he is taking University <br/>\ncourses at age 15!  So we just have to wait and trust in our kids!  <br/>\nHard as it is.  When I get doubtful, either because of my own <br/>\nthoughts or other peoples comments, I think of all the other <br/>\nsuccessful unschoolers out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;lpodietz&quot; &lt;lpodietz@...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m pretty new to this list, and to unschooling, having just begun <br/>\n&gt; this endeavor with my son in his 8th grade year.
