I had to do just that with my SIL who was truly dangerous. <br/>\nOh, the stories I could tell.  We explained to her that we would be asking <br/>\nfor a no-contact order and prosecute for harrassment, false charges and <br/>\nwhatever else we needed to do if she didn&#39;t just leave us in peace of her <br/>\nown accord.

She&#39;s doing a fine job messing up her own family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant about giving the power if you do something that is not of your <br/>\nfamily&#39;s choosing wasn&#39;t this kind of case.  What I meant is that I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink anybody should sell their house and move halfway across the country <br/>\njust to end contact with their family, unless it is what everyone in the <br/>\nfamily wants.  A move and a fresh start can be great, but if you do it just <br/>\nto get away from someone, there is always the chance that they will follow <br/>\nyou, and then you start a cycle of running.

No <br/>\nmatter how old she gets, or I get for that matter, nothing ever <br/>\nchanges. I am still &quot;a radical&quot;, and I am still made to feel guilty <br/>\nif I am not at her beck and call. I tried moving away about 600  <br/>\nmiles, eight years ago. As soon as my Dad retired guess where she <br/>\ninsisted they move to? You got it, 10 minutes from where I lived. My <br/>\nDad passed away almost two years ago and of course that was all my <br/>\nfault because he wouldn&#39;t have gotten cancer if they hadn&#39;t moved <br/>\nhere for me(??). The fact that it was lung cancer caused by the work <br/>\nhe did for 40 something years had nothing to do with it! Then we <br/>\nmoved to a different city and she also moved to be as close as <br/>\npossible. This past May we moved to the city again, due to the fact <br/>\nthat country life was just not what we all thought it would be, I <br/>\nwill save that rant for another time!!  So now she has her mobile <br/>\nhome up for sale because she suddenly has to move to the city as <br/>\nwell. My daughter and I were involved in a near fatal car accident <br/>\nlast year, I found out some very disturbing things about my second <br/>\nhusband and had demanded he move out a week before, and a lot of <br/>\nother crap had gone on around the same time. But, to hear it from her <br/>\nshe is the one who is so needy, and all my problems and what <br/>\nhappened,  again have to do with the fact that everyone&#39;s &quot;luck&quot; has <br/>\nbeen so bad since we moved to Pennsylvania. When I tell her I do not <br/>\nbelieve in luck she gets irate.

I have a feeling, though,<br/>\nthat my mother is going to deal with that this week. Dan and I are<br/>\nflying up to Portland, OR on Thursday and the kids are all staying<br/>\nwith my mom. She has lots of rules: places and times for eating,<br/>\ntimes for going to bed, limited electronic use (tv, computer, cell<br/>\nphone), going to church (why she is insisting on taking 3 agnostic or<br/>\nPagan children to a Christian church is beyond me!). I&#39;m sure when<br/>\nwe get back that my mom is going to have a long list of &quot;rebel issues&quot;<br/>\nthat I never see. We&#39;ve assured the kids that we are just a cell<br/>\nphone call away and we will intervene on their behalf. We&#39;ve raised<br/>\nour children with respect and we get that respect back. Not because<br/>\nwe &quot;deserve&quot; or &quot;expect&quot; it but because we show it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;end snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the only part of the picture you mentioned here.  Even then, <br/>\nit looked to me like you were heading for a bad week with Grandma.  <br/>\nIt sounded like you&#39;d told the kids they didn&#39;t have to do what <br/>\nGrandma asked of them -- that they could just call you and you&#39;d <br/>\nintervene.  Knowing you&#39;d likely be called upon to intervene doesn&#39;t <br/>\nsound like someone who had any reason to trust that things would work <br/>\nout with Grandma.  Besides that, do you feel it&#39;s respectful to be a <br/>\nguest in someone&#39;s home and behave with total disregard for their <br/>\nhousehold practices and expectations?  That was the situation you put <br/>\nyour Mom in -- she had houseguests who knew all they had to do was <br/>\ncall you to back them up when they wanted to disregard her <br/>\npreferences in her own home. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you&#39;re surprised it turned out badly? <br/>\n<br/>\nI know you wanted to believe your Mom could be trusted to respect <br/>\nyour kids&#39; preference, but given the lifestyle differences you were <br/>\nprobably asking for the impossible. <br/>\n<br/>\n******<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t just willy nilly leave my children to run off for a <br/>\nfrivolous weekend of glee with no regard for their well-being (both <br/>\nmentally and physically).

When I was pregnant<br/>\nand went to midwives instead of OB&#39;s for prenatal care (although I did<br/>\nhave c/s&#39;s), my mother thought I was being foolish.  When I chose to<br/>\nbreastfeed I was &quot;limiting myself&quot; by having to be with the baby all<br/>\nthe time (she also didn&#39;t like it that my breastfeeding kept her from<br/>\nkeeping the babies overnight like my brother&#39;s child did when she was<br/>\na baby).  When I chose to allow my children to wean naturally I was<br/>\ntold that they were too old to be &quot;doing that&quot; and I would never have<br/>\nany time to myself.  When I chose to homeschool I was neglecting their<br/>\neducational needs because I could never do all that the schools do for<br/>\nthem.  When I chose to parent gently, it was a slap in my mom&#39;s face<br/>\nbecause she raised me &quot;just fine&quot; the way she did it and all this &quot;ap<br/>\ncrap&quot; would just make for selfish and controlling children.  When I<br/>\nallowed Emily to leave school in the middle of 5th grade (after having<br/>\nbeen homeschooled previously) I was making a mistake.  I have that gut<br/>\nfeeling that my really felt that she had an opportunity to &quot;fix&quot; my<br/>\nkids in one week.

That sounds horrible to experience while being so far<br/>\naway from your children. I don&#39;t quite understand the purpose of the<br/>\ntrip and details of not being able to returning home. But I am glad<br/>\nthat you have gained so much awareness about your mother&#39;s needs for<br/>\ncontrol and desires to &quot;help&quot; in the manner that she sees fit,<br/>\nregardless of your own (and children&#39;s?) boundaries. That information<br/>\nwill certainly allow you to understand her &quot;agreement&quot; in the future.<br/>\nFrom your note, it sounds like your younger children were &quot;agreeable&quot;<br/>\nto remain with grandma? And that they similarly felt empowered to call<br/>\nfor &quot;rescuing&quot;, IF they felt they desired it? These have been my<br/>\ncriteria for leaving ds with anyone: that he is loved by the<br/>\ncaregiver, that *he* has a recourse and ability to access me, that I<br/>\ntrust that his *will* about his needs will be honored, and that I will<br/>\nreturn at the absolute first opportunity if he feels that he needs *me*.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can certainly give you empathy for your experience of anger and<br/>\nfrustration. But, I am stuck wondering about the children continuing<br/>\nwith your mother after she was &quot;caught&quot; disregarding your wishes. My<br/>\ninclination is to recognize your mother&#39;s underlying needs for<br/>\n&quot;helping&quot; on her own terms in her own home; but the betrayal of your<br/>\nagreement when you were vulnerable to alter the situation would have<br/>\nhad me at her door step on the next plane, regardless. As you<br/>\nmentioned, your connection, trust and relationship with your children<br/>\nis paramount. Even over the probable $1000+ last minute, one-way air<br/>\nfare, imo. I don&#39;t want to be Monday-Morning-Quaterbacking here, but<br/>\nwant to empathize the huge damage control costs associated with this<br/>\nsituation. Do your children also feel a similar betrayal?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, &quot;children are resilient&quot; is a common self-supportive<br/>\nmantra. But, I would examine the circumstances leading up to the<br/>\nsituation and determine ways that the feelings and needs of all<br/>\nparties, including your mother, could have more accurately and<br/>\nforthrightly been addressed. Apparently, your mother does not feel<br/>\nthat she can have her needs in her own home met, within the<br/>\nconstraints (actually freedoms), that your children desire. That is<br/>\neither something to avoid, or something to discuss further. Knowing<br/>\nperhaps, that this situation will NEVER happen again, it is easiest to<br/>\nmove on and just be glad for what you have learned, with as little<br/>\ndamage (or none) that occured, BECAUSE your children are empowered and<br/>\ntrust that their needs would be addressed by you all at any point that<br/>\nthey were voiced, even if grandma has some silly rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that you can find some perspective to understand your mom&#39;s<br/>\nposition of wanting something that was &quot;forbidden&quot;. It isn&#39;t unlike<br/>\nchildren who are &quot;not allowed&quot;, they still desire what they want, even<br/>\nif they have to sneak to have it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPat</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sad situation","postDate":"1166547707","msgId":19930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjEyMTkwOTAxdzdkN2E5ZTgzbjI2ZjY4OTMxNWE0YWJhZjNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19932,"prevInTime":19929,"nextInTime":19931,"topicId":19930,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My co-parent, Dan, and I just got back from a long weekend in Portland, Oregon and have come home to a huge mess.

We left our<br/>\nchildren in the care of my mother after many very long conversations<br/>\nabout respecting my children&#39;s routines and many other things.  My<br/>\nmother assured me repeatedly that she was not going to do anything<br/>\nthat would disturb their lives.  The first night after we left I got a<br/>\nfrantic phone call from Emily (14) because my mother sat them down and<br/>\ngave them this huge list of rules about what they could and couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndo and what she expected of them (very early bedtimes, no computers,<br/>\ncell phones, video games, limited tv, food only that she gives them,<br/>\netc. etc. etc.)  Basically exactly opposite of what she assured me she<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do.  Emily was threatening to run away and was begging me to<br/>\nlet her go stay at the house by herself.   I just wasn&#39;t comfortable<br/>\nyet with that, maybe next year or if we were in a different<br/>\nneighborhood where the neighbors actually are concerned with what<br/>\nhappens with each other and know each other.  Fortunatly, I was able<br/>\nto get Rose (a quiet member of our list who rarely posts and lives in<br/>\nour same town) on the phone.  She agreed to go &quot;rescue&quot; Emily.  I<br/>\nactually had to have Dan talk to her because I was crying so badly<br/>\nwith all the anger I had about my mother.  Of course my mother greatly<br/>\nchastized me for &quot;interfering&quot; and that I didn&#39;t allow her to &quot;work<br/>\nthings through&quot; with Emily (interpretation for those of you that don&#39;t<br/>\ntranslate my mother&#39;s verbiage - break her to do my will, but make her<br/>\nthink it was her idea).  There were several times this past weekend<br/>\nwhere I felt like some failure of a parent because of things that my<br/>\nmother said to me.  Of course I know none of it is true, but it is so<br/>\neasy for me to go into that &quot;I&#39;m not worthy because my mother doesn&#39;t<br/>\napprove&quot; stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my mother things I&#39;ve done wrong because I interfered and I<br/>\nfelt that I did right because my child asked me to help her and I did.<br/>\n My mom says that my interference has impacted our relationship and I<br/>\nfeel that my interference preserved the one that I have with my child<br/>\n(who I do have to live with at least for four more years).  I&#39;m glad<br/>\nthat my younger two children are a bit more flexible, but at the<br/>\nmoment they are in glommed onto the tv, soaking in it all.  I&#39;m sure<br/>\nit will be a while before they can trust again that their lives are<br/>\nback to normal.  The sad thing is that my mother thinks she was so<br/>\ngood at watching the kids because they went to bed when she told them<br/>\nto, stopped watching tv when she told them to and only ate what she<br/>\nallowed them to.  :-(  And she wonders why we want to move nearly<br/>\n3,000 miles away.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there is major damage that has been done with my<br/>\nrelationship with my mom.  I know now that I can never trust her again<br/>\nto care for my children and Dan and I are making serious changes to<br/>\nour will this week so that she won&#39;t be the primary care giver if<br/>\nsomething were to happen to us.  I just feel so betrayed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle - who is going to be busy in the next few weeks working to<br/>\nget her house ready to put on the market</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19990,"nextTopicId":19999}}
