The first hurdle is that to get<br/>\nan applicaton, I was asked for her grade average as they only take<br/>\nkids with high marks in school. I sent in a responce telling them that<br/>\nshe has no grade average as we have never done any tests. I offered a brief<br/>\nresume of her learnings instead.  THis responce was accecpted. <br/>\nI am looking forward to recieving the application this fall and I will be trying to offer a description of her learnings of the past years. She is of an age to be in grade 7.<br/>\nIf anyone has gone through this process before and has any advice, I would<br/>\nappreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWendy Whitaker</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44695,"nextTopicId":44404}}
