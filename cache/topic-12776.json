None of the children/grown adults interviewed <br/>\nwere unschooled in my opinion. They simply didn&#39;t go to school <br/>\n(although a couple did go to school on & off). Many were ignored. Some <br/>\ndid school-at-home on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was VERY poorly edited. Rephrase: it was NOT editted. It could have <br/>\nbeen 45 minutes shorter had someone editted it at all. He just took <br/>\nevery interview and cut & pasted them into sections. Several of the <br/>\ninterviewees were sad and pitiful. Only two seemed as if they could <br/>\nmake it on their own. The interviewees were dull and uninspiring.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would NOT NOT NOT recommend this to show a spouse who was unsure. It <br/>\nwould definitely make him avoid unschooling!

Anyway, I as so worked up that I<br/>\nwrote him a HUGE email that will await him when he gets to work in the<br/>\nmorning...here is a portion, the last paragraph in my &quot;book&quot; that<br/>\nawaits him...<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAlright, I&#39;m done, I don&#39;t know what else to say or do but I really<br/>\nwish that you would step over and trust me and more importantly trust<br/>\nyour kids and even more...trust that this will work for Zachary too. <br/>\nHe wants to write you an email someday, but with how you are makes me<br/>\nworried that instead of reading through the errors and just enjoying<br/>\nthe email sent out of just PURE LOVE for his Dad, that you&#39;d instead<br/>\nbe critical and say, &quot;Yeah, Zak that was nice but you spelled this<br/>\nwrong and your grammar was poor.&quot;  Then you&#39;d be pissed off with me, I<br/>\nhate feeling like that but I do, I love you but you are making this<br/>\nreally hard on me and on the kids because sometimes Brooke will ask to<br/>\ndo &#39;schooly&#39; things because her dad thinks it&#39;s important.  I need you<br/>\nto be on the same page, I need you to look past what the schools say<br/>\nare important and what the school folks say their children are doing<br/>\nand when reading an email from your kids (even if riddled with errors)<br/>\nsmile and say to yourself, &quot;Well, they forgot to use spell check&quot; and<br/>\nthen write them back writing as you would write me, not correcting my<br/>\nerrors, but just writing me back.  I guarantee you that over a period<br/>\nof time, because they would see how you write (paragraphs,<br/>\npunctuation, etc.) and would be able to  write you without fear of<br/>\ncriticism; that their emails would more and more, little by little,<br/>\nstart looking &#39;right&#39; grammatically and spelling would be improved<br/>\nalso.  However, if they fear you&#39;ll be disappointed in how they write,<br/>\nthen forget it, they are better off not writing you but know this...it<br/>\nisn&#39;t because they don&#39;t love you, it&#39;s because they fear<br/>\ndisappointing you and being &#39;scolded&#39; by you.<br/>\n_____________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nHow sad that would make me to know that my children wouldn&#39;t write me<br/>\nbecause I&#39;d correct them all of the time instead of just enjoying the<br/>\nletter.  <br/>\n<br/>\n~Sandy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":264026771,"authorName":"LuvnMomma24boys@aol.com","from":"LuvnMomma24boys@...","profile":"prettypainthorsies","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] *SIGH* Big DH Hurdle to try and Overcome","postDate":"1146713541","msgId":12778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxZS4zNzVhYTcyLjMxOGFjZmM1QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12777,"nextInTopic":12779,"prevInTime":12777,"nextInTime":12779,"topicId":12776,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 5/3/2006 10:26:13 P.M.
