I still feel it is a lie on some level to<br/>\ntake what  they are learning and make it fit state regulations. I know my<br/>\nsons do too  on some level. So does my family. I worked on changing my<br/>\nmind and for the  most part I am satisfied they are learning and I talk<br/>\nto them to get them  to understand what they are learning. I don&#39;t mean<br/>\nto sound defensive or to  instigate anything by what I am saying. It is<br/>\nmore another layer of me  working though the old thoughts that were put<br/>\nin my head all these years.  ***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMichele, I think I understand what you are saying about &quot;lying&quot; to the  <br/>\nstate.  I&#39;ve also had a difficult time resolving that issue in my  mind.  Some of <br/>\nus are just more highly sensitive to legalities, lies, fibs,  etc.  I can&#39;t <br/>\neven enter a store where it is marked &quot;exit&quot; even if other  people are doing it.  <br/>\n:)  <br/>\n <br/>\nThose diplomas aren&#39;t going to affect who you children are and whether or  <br/>\nnot they are successful at their jobs.  Unfortunately, they need them to  get <br/>\ntheir foot in the door, but once they are working, it is up to them to do  the <br/>\nwork!  Then they will be judged on their performance, not on the  diploma.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe state doesn&#39;t care who your children are or what they do or don&#39;t do  <br/>\nwell, really.  They are interested in putting a check next to another name  to <br/>\nsay they&#39;ve done their job to &quot;educate&quot; them.  No one cares that your  son read <br/>\nMoby Dick, but someone thought that was an important thing and now you  are <br/>\n&quot;illegal&quot; if you haven&#39;t read it.  If he needs to read it for work, he  can read <br/>\nit then. Maybe your sons need a serious discussion about where the  state <br/>\nrequirements come from and that they have no real importance in their real  <br/>\nlives.  Do they feel like they are lying to deceive or that they are  fudging some <br/>\nmeaningless facts that will never hurt anyone (but necessary in  today&#39;s <br/>\nworld)?<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps you can get in touch with some unschoolers in your state that have  <br/>\ndealt with this also.  Maybe someone knows of some other options that you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t know about.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I agree with Deb that as long as you aren&#39;t passing yourself off to a  <br/>\npotential employer as something that you are not, it shouldn&#39;t be an  issue.  It <br/>\nis a minor blip on the whole of their lives.<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5696,"nextTopicId":5701}}
