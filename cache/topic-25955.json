ADD is an <br/>\noverblown misused label used by schools et al to describe a very normal <br/>\nperson who probably has a visual spatial thinking and learning <br/>\nstyle.This may or may not be coupled with hyperactivity hence ADHD. IMHO <br/>\nThis labeling has caused a mass hysteria that someone is broken or <br/>\ndefective if labeled ADD. When usually just means that they don&#39;t fit <br/>\nthe classic sit quietly in class do as your told school atmosphere, or a <br/>\nslew of other personalty traits that are not conducive to a classroom.. <br/>\nIn an unschooling setting the label (as all disablilty labels)  is a non <br/>\nissue as the child is in charge of how he/she learns and as the parent <br/>\nyou foster the individuals needs accordingly.  The so called ADD child <br/>\nis not necessarily bored or hyper because he/she is engaged in something <br/>\nthat is fulfilling his need or desire. If they are bored and hyper you <br/>\nare trying your darndest to figure out what they need not medicate or <br/>\npunish. I do not believe that anything can cause ADD particularly <br/>\nwatching too much TV. Certainly not getting needs met in certain <br/>\natmospheres can exacerbate someone who happens to have that style of <br/>\nlearning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo bottom line to the apprehensive TV people, please do not think that <br/>\nyou can make your children have ADD. My guess that most of the children <br/>\nin those studies are schooled children with not a lot of present <br/>\nparenting ;-) . I have spent the last two years researching and <br/>\nunderstanding this as my son Jake (9) was &quot;labeled&quot; Dyslexic and I have <br/>\ncome full circle trying to help him overcome his &quot;disability&quot; and have <br/>\nlearned that there is NO disability. He has blossomed with self directed <br/>\norganic learning and I let go more and more of my preconceived notion <br/>\nthat he should be doing xyz.  Jake has loved TV since he could crawl <br/>\nover to it. My other ds&#39;s (ages 3 and 6) never paid it much attention <br/>\nuntil they were about 2. Jake is visual loves documentaries and loves to <br/>\nbe read to and is an encyclopedia about many topics but just don&#39;t ask <br/>\nhim to read or write about it. DS 6 a reading fiend. In a classroom Jake <br/>\nspaces off the topic at hand if it is not of interest. (Conferences: he <br/>\nwon&#39;t pay attention he must be add) Now he is home and free to pursue <br/>\nwhatever strikes his fancy. Some days this is TV and someday not. I <br/>\ntrust him to make his own choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a mother of more than one child is hard and I completely empathize <br/>\nwith you,  always pulled in different direction.
