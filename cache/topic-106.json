Your quest <br/>\nbecomes cluttered and takes on inconsequential tangets that have <br/>\nlittle significance in your actual day to day life.. Things like <br/>\ndefining unschooling and trying to place how one unschools in <br/>\nvarying degrees of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; hinder from actually learning <br/>\nanything about the lifestyle.    Personal conflicts only deter your <br/>\npath to unschooling,  they do NOT enable it.  &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, but your personal experience is not relevant to all other <br/>\npeople of course.<br/>\nBecause the very thing you found a hindrance, I found the be THE <br/>\nsingle most useful tool in helping me get to an unschooling mindset <br/>\nand let go of the school baggage I&#39;d carried around for so long.<br/>\nEventually, finding real life unschoolers became important to me, <br/>\nbut not for defining unschooling, simply for friendship that didn&#39;t <br/>\ncome with a bunch of explanations.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think meeting real life unschoolers is hugely valuable to a lot <br/>\nof folks, but not everyone. <br/>\nI have a solid support group, with 8 unschooling families and a host <br/>\nof other homeschooling styles, that get together weekly...sometimes <br/>\nmore. So I do think your advice on finding real live unschoolers is <br/>\ngood.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just because some people get bogged down in discussion and <br/>\ndebate, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t extremely helpful for others. I think <br/>\nit was the absolute BEST thing for my personal journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice I give, that I think applies to us all, is I encourage <br/>\npeople to research a LOT of different resources. Read many different <br/>\nbooks, check out lots of online lists and sites and speak to many <br/>\ndifferent people. No one should be trusting one source of <br/>\ninformation for all of their knowledge. <br/>\nI trust that we all are capable of finding the methods and styles of <br/>\nlearning that work best for US personally (whoa, an unschooling <br/>\nconcept) and the most helpful sources and people are going to be <br/>\ndifferent for every journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":101,"nextTopicId":105}}
