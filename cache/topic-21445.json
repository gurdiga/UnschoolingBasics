The<br/>\nlink to the website is: <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pbskids.org/wordgirl/\">http://pbskids.org/wordgirl/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nClick on the left side &quot;Heroes, Villains & Mere Mortals&quot; then select the<br/>\ncharacter &quot;Tobey&quot;. Here&#39;s the character description from the website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tobey is a 10-year-old home schooled genius who causes serious property<br/>\ndamage in order to get WordGirl&#39;s attention, not that he&#39;d ever admit it.<br/>\nHe&#39;s a master of robotics, building giant robots to do his bidding. He&#39;s<br/>\nconstantly trying to prove that he is WordGirl&#39;s intellectual superior, and<br/>\nthat he isn&#39;t afraid of his mommy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one episode, there is a comment about Tobey that &quot;he&#39;s so timid that he<br/>\nhas a hard time making friends.&quot; In the same episode, Tobey also acts very<br/>\nrude and destructive. You can see this episode and others (they are all only<br/>\na minute or so long) by going to the same website link above and clicking on<br/>\n&quot;Adventures of WordGirl&quot; on the left side of the webpage, and then when the<br/>\n&quot;Choose a Character&quot; screen comes up, select &quot;Tobey&quot; and then click on the<br/>\nfirst picture under &quot;Choose an Episode&quot; at the bottom of the screen (it&#39;s<br/>\nthe one with the robot picture).<br/>\n<br/>\nScholastic&#39;s choice to portray this intelligent, yet socially inept and<br/>\ndeviant character as a home schooled student is a glaring attack on home<br/>\nschooling and educational choice. Scholastic would not have dared to portray<br/>\nthis character as a racial minority or as a homosexual, yet they feel at<br/>\nliberty to attack home schooled students and indirectly their parents who<br/>\nthey imply are making social misfits out of their children by teaching them<br/>\nat home. This programming is seen by thousands of children every day and is<br/>\na means of influencing their attitudes toward home schooled students. As the<br/>\nsaying goes, &quot;If you say it loud enough and long enough, the people will<br/>\nbelieve it.&quot; There is no evidence to support the socialization concern in<br/>\nregards to home schooled students, yet the educational establishment<br/>\ncontinues with this propaganda.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if your children do not watch PBS, please contact Scholastic Media (the<br/>\ncreators of the WordGirl cartoon) and Scholastic Corporation (the owner of<br/>\nScholastic Media) and let them know your feelings about their choice to<br/>\nportray this socially deviant &quot;villain&quot; as a home schooled student. We need<br/>\nto stop the continued insinuations by the educational establishment that<br/>\nhome schooling results in a lack of social aptitude. Insist that Scholastic<br/>\nMedia stop making episodes with Tobey and also mention that you will not be<br/>\npurchasing any more of Scholastic&#39;s educational books or products until you<br/>\nsee that they have removed this character from the WordGirl episodes. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, please contact your local PBS station and ask that they stop<br/>\nairing the WordGirl episodes that involve Tobey and remove them from their<br/>\nwebsite. Emphasize that the portrayal of Tobey as a socially deviant home<br/>\nschooled student is a direct attack on home schooled students and their<br/>\nfamilies. If you happen to be a financial supporter of your local PBS<br/>\nstation, make sure to mention this fact to them and tell them that you<br/>\ncannot support a station that airs such programming. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo find your local PBS station contact information, go to: <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/index.html\">http://www.pbs.org/stationfinder/index.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo contact Scholastic Media, write, fax, or call:<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah A.
