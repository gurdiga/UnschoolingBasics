I don&#39;t buy extended warranties on any other products (none), but<br/>\nmy attitude about laptops is that they are very fragile and *will* be broken<br/>\nat some point, so I just factor the warranty coverage into the price right<br/>\noff the bat.  I&#39;ve used Dell warranty service about 10 times in the past 4<br/>\nor 5 years, mostly for damage repairs.  For example, my son as he was<br/>\nbecoming more mobile knocked both mine and my wife&#39;s laptop onto the floor<br/>\nfrom an ottoman or stool, breaking the power socket which is part of the<br/>\nmotherboard.  Both times, Dell had a new motherboard installed within 24<br/>\nhours, without having to mail the laptop away for several days (which is the<br/>\nonly warranty service available from most laptop manufacturers).  Dell will<br/>\novernight FedEx the part to a local service tech with whom they contract to<br/>\ncomplete the work.  A month ago, the video card on my laptop died (due to a<br/>\nfaulty Nvidia chip, a problem that is affecting a lot of 2007 laptops), and<br/>\nI got a new motherboard installed the next day.<br/>\n  <br/>\nThe Dell Outlet is a good place to shop.  Right now, I see about 100 Dell<br/>\nInspiron laptops below $500 (and many below $400) in their Outlet, which<br/>\ncontains items that have been returned, refurbished, etc., but have the same<br/>\nwarranty as brand-new systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://preview.tinyurl.com/ytcvj9\">http://preview.tinyurl.com/ytcvj9</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI also shop ebay a lot, but I&#39;ll only buy Dell laptops that still have a<br/>\nwarranty in effect.  If any warranty (either original or extended) is still<br/>\nin effect, Dell lets you buy more warranty coverage (which I always do).<br/>\nDell even let me add Complete Care warranty on an already-broken laptop<br/>\nonce.  I called tech support to say that I had dropped and broken my laptop,<br/>\nand the tech said that I only had a basic warranty in effect (due to an<br/>\noversight on my part), so the drop damage wasn&#39;t covered.  So he advised me<br/>\nto buy the Complete Care warranty that day, wait &#39;til it showed up on my<br/>\naccount, then call them back.  It took over 24 hours for the new warranty<br/>\ncoverage to be effective, then I called back and the laptop was repaired the<br/>\nnext day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 2007 Latitude D630 I&#39;m typing on right now came from ebay, the 2005 12&quot;<br/>\nInspiron 700m my son uses came from ebay (originally purchased for my wife<br/>\nin 2006 or so), and the 2008 XPS m1330 (all of these are Dells) that my wife<br/>\nis using came from Dell Outlet as a refurb.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDell also has a brand new mini-computer called the Inspiron Mini.  9&quot;<br/>\nscreen, not fully featured, but perfect for web and email, etc.  And less<br/>\nthan $500.  It&#39;s brand new, so I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s available for<br/>\npurchase yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor desktop systems, I prefer to just buy the parts from newegg.com and<br/>\nbuild it myself.  I sometimes say (only semi-jokingly) that I&#39;ve actually<br/>\nused the same desktop PC since about 1996, but all the parts are different<br/>\nexcept for a floppy drive that was in that original Pentium 120 system, I<br/>\nthink.  I&#39;ve just upgraded in small increments over a dozen years, and I&#39;m<br/>\non my 3rd case.  A few months ago I splurged and upgraded to a quad-core CPU<br/>\nand a motherboard to support it, to make video editing quicker.  I also<br/>\nbought some new RAM at that time, but everything else (hard drives, video<br/>\ncard, etc) got carried over from the old system. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Disclaimer:  I&#39;m not affiliated with Dell in any way other than as a<br/>\nsatisfied customer who has owned about 8 of their laptops in the past 6 or 8<br/>\nyears.  I have no reason to buy anything else.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=b.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"graymamacita","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Computers was Re: X-Post: Sharing is Caring","postDate":"1220971217","msgId":35787,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNCNDUwQTc1LTM0REItNDA0RS05NEU1LTcwQTA3NzI2QzdCMkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDFkMzIyOGIxMDgwOTA5MDYwM3U2NzUxOGM5M3g3NmFmMzYzNTMzMDUyYWE4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDMyOTkwNkVGLTA4RjItNEI4QS1CMjFELTdBOUJBNUU2QThDQUB5YWhvby5jb20+IDw0OGM2NzMzNC4xMmRhNjAwYS43Y2VjLjExN2RAbXguZ29vZ2xlLmNvbT4gPDFkMzIyOGIxMDgwOTA5MDYwM3U2NzUxOGM5M3g3NmFmMzYzNTMzMDUyYWE4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35783,"nextInTopic":35788,"prevInTime":35786,"nextInTime":35788,"topicId":35740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On getting cheap computers, Brad is right that you can find some cheap computers through Dell and other venders....I know at Wal-Mart last week they had some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-556180920\">On getting cheap computers, Brad is right that you can find some  <br/>\ncheap computers through Dell and other venders....I know at Wal-Mart  <br/>\nlast week they had some Dell&#39;s on clearance for $200.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found computers at the local university, in their &#39;overflow&#39; shop.  <br/>\nMost colleges and universities have these shops, with computers,  <br/>\nfurniture, books, equipment....as they replace items, they store them  <br/>\nand will open the store on a regular basis.

I remember the first  <br/>\ntime I met a Trinidadian woman who did not &#39;share&#39; her clothing how  <br/>\nshocked I was.  She is one of my best friends, is extremely generous  <br/>\nwith her time, her money, her house, her car, but she doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>\ncomfortable sharing clothing.  She always says to me - don&#39;t forget I  <br/>\ngrew up without sisters.  I have been very &#39;boundaryless&#39; with my  <br/>\nfriends and my family - go into their fridge, look through their  <br/>\njewelry, flip through their books - and most of them don&#39;t even blink  <br/>\nand even like it or do the same things with me.  But of course when I  <br/>\nlived in the US during college I learned how to behave differently  <br/>\nand it was sometimes a struggle holding back from using things that  <br/>\nwere not mine.  Life got a lot easier when I moved into an  <br/>\ninternational dormitory and everyone there, including the USers,  <br/>\nbehaved like me around their things.<br/>\nMy children have lived in both places but in South Miami Beach, where  <br/>\nwe spend most of our time when in the US, the attitude is also very  <br/>\nvery relaxed around things.  We used to hang out in gangs at the  <br/>\nplayground and on the beach and the toys, the food, the diapers and  <br/>\nwipes, and lots more were almost communal property.  But there were  <br/>\nsome boundaries with the children with toys or strollers.  Especially  <br/>\nthe younger children who were more interested in keeping a favourite  <br/>\ntoy.  Now that most of the children there are in school it is a bit  <br/>\ndifferent because sometimes there is a standoffishness that never  <br/>\nexisted before.  It thaws after a while however.  And then the tribal  <br/>\nway begins again.<br/>\nI don&#39;t think that the way that we feel about our possessions and  <br/>\nwhether they are for us to use, for others to use, and for how long  <br/>\nis only about caring for others.  It also includes how we feel about  <br/>\nscarcity.  And I am thinking that living my life in the generous way  <br/>\nthat my parents lived - and live - their lives when I was small, will  <br/>\ngive my children the opportunity to see in action a lack of intense  <br/>\nworry about how our possessions relate to our quality of life.  When  <br/>\nmy son was in sailing camp during the school vacation we ended up  <br/>\nwith lots of discussions because within the car pool our car is the  <br/>\noldest - not that old but we are in an economic boom here and  <br/>\neveryone seems to have a spanking new car - and we are the only ones  <br/>\nwho live in an apartment.  So the car pool talks in the car did  <br/>\ninclude perspectives on why I choose not to spend money on a new car,  <br/>\nand with my son on how come our home is older - which I love but  <br/>\nchildren sometimes like new homes - and how come despite those  <br/>\nseeming disadvantages that everyone still wants to come by us all the  <br/>\ntime.<br/>\nI see how these issues sometimes swirl around my children&#39;s heads.   <br/>\nMy 3 year old daughter brings them up all all the time - mainly why  <br/>\ndo we live in an old home?  why is our car so old?  - and my son  <br/>\nlooks at how we don&#39;t have all new things but he gets to use the  <br/>\ncomputers all the time, he gets to buy tokens and membership on  <br/>\nonline games, and he has very good skills on the games and a fair  <br/>\namount of respect in the way that I speak to him most of the time.   <br/>\nSo others usually want to come here or call him from the US on  <br/>\nSkype.  I see how all the time my daughter and my son are figuring  <br/>\nout what these things mean, what are the relative values of things  <br/>\nover people.  And when there are quiet moments the questions - from  <br/>\nmy daughter - or the complaints - from my son - show where their  <br/>\nobservations lead them.  Plus they fight pretty regularly trying to  <br/>\nfigure out with each other who gets what and how I respond.<br/>\nI want us to have a very very open household where people are welcome  <br/>\nand where we have so many different perspectives and approaches.   <br/>\nBoth my children love having people over, having sleep overs, calling  <br/>\nothers to come and eat, watch a movie, play a game.  They would  <br/>\nprobably live with 100 others if they had the ability to do so.  For  <br/>\nme one of the big advantages of living in the Caribbean is that  <br/>\ndespite the crime and all the other horrible things, there is  <br/>\ndefinitely more a sense of human to human than I ever experienced in  <br/>\nmy many years of living and travelling in the US or in the UK or  <br/>\nEurope - with a few exceptions.  Trinidad is trying to follow the  <br/>\nNorth American way these days and it may suit North America but it  <br/>\nsure doesn&#39;t suit our environment.<br/>\nAnyhow, long post already but since so much of unschooling to me is  <br/>\nhaving people - young and old - figure things out by watching others,  <br/>\nthinking things through, experimenting, I certainly think that our  <br/>\nhousehold attitudes to material things and how we can determine the  <br/>\ndestiny of our possessions is a super big and important aspect of  <br/>\nconsensual unschooling living and deserves lots and lots of  <br/>\ndiscussion time.<br/>\nGillian<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  Don&#39;t assume that we have it all down pat here though.

If the <br/>\nrelationship and open communication are the &quot;goals&quot; rather than &quot;who <br/>\ngets the object&quot; then there&#39;s a world of options.

In a <br/>\nsense, he&#39;s relinquishing the tv in order to &quot;keep the peace&quot; - a <br/>\ntired 7yo who needs to watch another hour of tv to wind down isn&#39;t a <br/>\nfun person to be around. But there are times when he really wants to <br/>\nwatch whatever is on from 8-9. A new episode or a movie, usually. So <br/>\nhe&#39;ll tell me that and I&#39;ll look for another solution - we have <br/>\nanother tv, but its in the master bedroom where I and Mo both sleep <br/>\n(and really there aren&#39;t any other rooms in the house - downstairs <br/>\nis open and upstairs is bedroom). He&#39;s not obligated to give up the <br/>\ntv, though, its one of the available options and we&#39;re always on the <br/>\nlookout for more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s part of what I mean by partnership and communication. Its not <br/>\na question of &quot;should Ray share the tv?&quot; Its &quot;hey, how much do you <br/>\nreally want to watch this show? would you be willing to do something <br/>\nelse or watch Discovery Channel so Mo can watch too? Mo, do you have <br/>\nany other ideas? Would you like to snuggle with me in the bed or <br/>\ntell stories?&quot; Or maybe I&#39;ll decide I can fall asleep with the tv on <br/>\ntonight.

The word is <br/>\njust soooo loaded its hard to have a real conversation without <br/>\neverything getting bogged down in weird moral imperatives. Yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf another parent says &quot;share&quot; I&#39;ll ask &quot;how?&quot; or substitute or <br/>\nsuggest something different - &quot;take turns&quot; is usually an acceptible <br/>\nalternative, and (happily) its not loaded in quite the same way. So <br/>\nits easier to help children (and their parents) communicate <br/>\nabout &quot;taking turns&quot; - how is it going to happen and all that. <br/>\nNegotiation is more implicit in &quot;turn taking&quot; for sure! That&#39;s my <br/>\ngoal when I&#39;m interacting with others - to keep opening up <br/>\ncommunication. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find that a focus on communication often does &quot;keep the peace&quot; in <br/>\nthe sense that conflicts don&#39;t become as heated, feelings aren&#39;t as <br/>\nlikely to be hurt, and everyone (kids and parents) is more likely to <br/>\ncome away from the moment feeling okay. I&#39;m not approaching the <br/>\nmoment from a desire to &quot;keep the peace&quot; per se, though. Its okay <br/>\nfor negotiation to be heated, for people to express strong feelings <br/>\nit they need to do so!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in the long run with teens and young adults growing up with very<br/>\n&gt; little to no concept of personal ownership and who might find<br/>\n&gt; themselves being taken advantage, but be too concerned about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>keeping<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; the peace than to stand up for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the things I&#39;ve seen in my own kids is that by focusing on <br/>\ncommunication and problem solving, they pick up those skills. Ray is <br/>\nreally good at problem solving unless someone is determined to &quot;put <br/>\nhim in his place&quot; bc he&#39;s a kid. Then I need to be the one to stand <br/>\nup and say &quot;excuse me, the Kid has something valuble to contribute, <br/>\nhere&quot;. When he knows that kind of support is available, Ray is <br/>\ngracious, charming and a fantastic negotiator. When he&#39;s stuck <br/>\nwithout that support for awhile he reverts to &quot;typical teen&quot; sorts <br/>\nof strategies like resistance and defiance. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo&#39;s also good at problem solving in social situations - and again <br/>\nit depends a lot on her knowing that no-one, kid or adult, is going <br/>\nto run over the top of her bc she&#39;s younger. In either case, I, <br/>\npersonally, don&#39;t find it helpful to think in terms of rights or <br/>\neven personal ownership. If I do I quickly become Mamma Bear <br/>\ndefending her cubs! Roooooaaaarrr! Ahem. Not helpful. Its more <br/>\nhelpful for *me* to stay focused on the communication aspect - and <br/>\nif someone is shutting down &quot;the Kid&quot; or &quot;the Little kid&quot; that means <br/>\nhelping those kids to be heard.

Now I am very much a communal person and have no<br/>\nissues sharing, but it took me time to realize that there were people<br/>\nout there who weren&#39;t keeping score and who didn&#39;t just take and take. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel as though it is my place or another parent&#39;s place to<br/>\nforce/insist on a relinquishment of anything a child owns --<br/>\nespecially in the name of keeping the peace. I see more harm in this<br/>\nin the long run with teens and young adults growing up with very<br/>\nlittle to no concept of personal ownership and who might find<br/>\nthemselves being taken advantage, but be too concerned about keeping<br/>\nthe peace than to stand up for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nmichele<br/>\nwww.naturalattachment.net</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":155541138,"authorName":"Gillian Goddard","from":"Gillian Goddard &lt;gilliangoddard@...&gt;","profile":"gilliangoddard","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:X-Post: Sharing is Caring","postDate":"1220824638","msgId":35752,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFBRkMyN0Y3LUYxQzQtNDhBMi1BMTc1LTQ0MkZDMjAwRDk0RkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35751,"nextInTopic":35753,"prevInTime":35751,"nextInTime":35753,"topicId":35740,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I loved responding on your blog Michele.

If we&#39;re at a crowded children&#39;s museum and he wants to play at a <br/>\nparticular station for a loooong time, I&#39;ll bring up the idea of <br/>\ngiving that guy over there a turn and coming back later.  He&#39;s often <br/>\nfine with that because he&#39;s often &quot;that guy over there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if he&#39;s playing with something and doesn&#39;t want to share, I&#39;ll <br/>\naffirm what he&#39;s feeling (&quot;you&#39;re busy with that right now&quot;) and <br/>\nmention that he can give it to so-and-so when he&#39;s all done.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnly a couple of times another kid has started a tug of war with him, <br/>\nand Dmitri got agitated.  I got close and put my own hand on the <br/>\nobject in question so as to neutralize the force in either direction <br/>\nand just said the same things I always do, but also affirming how the <br/>\nother kid felt.  &quot;He really wants to play with that toy.  You&#39;re busy <br/>\nwith it now.  You can give it to him when you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if that was too intrusive, but my primary objective was <br/>\nto help Dmitri through his agitation, and it seemed to work.
