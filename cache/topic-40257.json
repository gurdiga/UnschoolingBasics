I blogged somewhat this past year and I have gone through some email exchanges with other parents to pull together what would be considered core class work. I want the journal available if I am ever asked, I do not have to send it in to the state. Anyway, this what I looked at for math. My daughter has helped me to bake and cook, so I would guess that covered fractions, addition, and subtraction; also we had to convert a number of recipes from a friend in Europe from metric to standard measurements. She went with me to the grocery store and helped me figure out all the by X for $X. So that covers division figuring out if there is a real savings by breaking down to the individual cost and comparing to the regular price. While we are shopping I round our numbers up to keep a running total to stay within budget. She used a calculator to keep an actual total and then we figured sales tax. So<br/>\n multiplication and percents. None of this was done with the intent of teaching, my daughter asked how she could help and we just went about what we had to do. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading and writing was fairly easy. She has read a wide variety of graphic novels. She is finding that there are graphic novels above and beyond her beloved manga. I have lost count of how many books she has read. She loves to tell me about the characters and adventures they have and has even found in many cases tv shows out on the web based on some of the series that she likes. For writing she loves keeping a journal, writing poetry, emailing and snail mailing friends and family, writing songs, short stories and creating some small comics. These are things she did for her own enjoyment. Oh and there was the proposal on why having a terraium would be beneficial and wouldn&#39;t count as having pets in the house, we aren&#39;t allowed pets according to our lease. She presented it complete with a power point presentation to her daddy, it has taken quite a while but he was quite impressed by the overall effort and depth of detail. So we are now deciding what type<br/>\n of terraium we will have. DH informed the landlord that she is required to do a science project involving a terraium and the landlord ok&#39;d it as long as it isn&#39;t a cat or a dog type of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a variety of workbooks, unit study thingies that I printed out and made available. My daughter did some of these as well. The ones she felt like doing I have put in tote box to hold on to. They run the gambit from spelling, math, language arts, history, current events, etc. Oh and I cannot forget her puzzle books and maze books and such. If someone were to look at all that we &quot;did&quot; during this past school year and compare it to school we would probably come up short on something I am sure.
