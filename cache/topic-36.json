Although we don&#39;t have to turn  them <br/>\nin, its in Missouri&#39;s law that we have them for evidence in court should  <br/>\nsomeone question what we are doing.<br/>\n  I only have the last year behind me, but you&#39;ll probably be directed  to a <br/>\nsite like educationese.  It really will open your eyes to how play, or  trips <br/>\nto different places IS learning.  Read lots of books on unschooling,  so you <br/>\ncan get the feel of exactly what this is all about.  After you  understand <br/>\nthat, if you are wanting to make it all look very &quot;professional&quot;  there is another <br/>\nsite that has teachers terminology that makes it easy to take  what you kids <br/>\nare learning and put it on paper in that language only teachers  use!<br/>\n Syndi-----ps....the best advice I got when starting to hs was to take  the <br/>\nyear off to learn exactly what we were going to do.  So I started  studying all <br/>\nthe different methods which lead to unschooling which lead to  reasons to <br/>\ntrust my kids which lead to a whole lifestyle change.  And some  much happier <br/>\nkids!  <br/>\n <br/>\n&quot;...since  we can&#39;t know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it <br/>\nis senseless  to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn <br/>\nout people who  love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able <br/>\nto learn whatever  needs to be learned.&quot;<br/>\n-- _John  Holt_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quoteworld.org/author.php?thetext=John+Holt)\">http://www.quoteworld.org/author.php?thetext=John+Holt)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Intro","postDate":"1088254852","msgId":1085,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBNkNGQjM5LUM3NzAtMTFEOC1CQTUyLTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNiaXFqbCttc245QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNiaXFqbCttc245QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1084,"nextInTopic":1096,"prevInTime":1084,"nextInTime":1086,"topicId":36,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tabitha, Here s a link that you might find useful and then you could just tweek it a bit to fit your child(ren) s portfolio.

Worrying now about assessments for the 7<br/>\nweeker MAY be a tad unnecessary ;) - the law may have changed in 6 years.<br/>\nCongratulations on a new baby. <br/>\n<br/>\nI urge you to get in touch with some State and local groups. People in<br/>\nStates that have assessments tend to keep word of mouth networks about<br/>\nassessors who are unschooling friendly, as well as having good advice about<br/>\nhow much to show, and what materials are looked for by the assessors. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne group local to you is: (from NHEN)<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.ohiohomeeducators.net/<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if they are unschooling friendly, but they do have legislative<br/>\ninfo posted. I&#39;m sure Ohio contingent here will come out of the woodwork as<br/>\nthe day progresses.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I gather online, most people who are initially worried find they<br/>\nend up with more than enough material to show &quot;progress&quot; just by collecting<br/>\n(with their concurrence of course) samples of the stuff their kids do on a<br/>\ndaily basis, photos of outings or building projects, and things like ticket<br/>\nstubs and receipts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
