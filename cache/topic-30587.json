So they&#39;ll  <br/>\ncome up with some way that local school districts review our kids&#39;  <br/>\ntest scores and probably some stupid arrangement where kids with low  <br/>\nscores will get &quot;help&quot; from the school district (whether we want it or  <br/>\nnot).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, what will they test? Probably exactly what the public school kids  <br/>\nare being tested on - the state mandated standardized tests, not tests  <br/>\nof our own choice.

I wonder if he realizes that the vast majority of physical and sexual abuse is undetectable on physical exam, even by experienced experts (which most doctors aren&#39;t).   I wonder if he knows that most abused children are actually in school and have interfaced with doctors for years before the abuse is detected?  I would wonder if he has ever been involved with referring cases to social services?  Most teachers, nurses and doctors with a few years&#39; experience have stories about the horrors of the system, frequently resulting in kids being left in unsafe environments, and sometimes removed traumatically from safe environments.  And the staff of social services may or may not have good training, or resources, or compassion. Ditto anyone else assigned to these proposed compulsory exams, doctors and<br/>\n nurses included.  There is no evidence that homeschooling is associated with increased rates of child maltreatment.  So we would subject *all* kids to an invasive, assaultive yearly exam in order to involve them and their fates in an acutely flawed system?  Why not just snatch all the kids from their parents at birth, then.  This idea is the proverbial &#39;going after a housefly with a bomb&#39; but can gain momentum if not carefully examined.  Whew!

One is seeking actual review by the<br/>\nSupreme Court. HSC and at least several of the other major groups&#39;<br/>\nlegal teams aren&#39;t in favor of that. Even if you could get the court<br/>\nto accept your petition (they only take 3-5% of cases), the chances<br/>\nthat it will be decided the way you want aren&#39;t real good. It&#39;s a very<br/>\ndangerous road to take, because if the Supreme Court were to affirm<br/>\nthe appellate court ruling on either of the main points<br/>\n(constitutional or statutory), there aren&#39;t many options left. The<br/>\nconstitutional argument, of course, could be appealed to the US<br/>\nSupreme Court, but the statutory case about the proper interpretation<br/>\nof the California Education Code could not. California Supreme Court<br/>\nis the last stop on that road. If that happens, then you have two bad<br/>\nchoices that I&#39;ll discuss below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another much easier choice, and it&#39;s the one we want, as well<br/>\nas the one being trumpeted in the HSLDA petition. You ask the<br/>\nCalifornia Supreme Court to depublish the opinion, or, in other words,<br/>\nhave them say that while this might have been the right result in this<br/>\nparticular case involving this particular set of facts, the court<br/>\nfinds that the reach of the opinion is overbroad and should not become<br/>\nlaw for the entire state. That is the choice we all (meaning HSC and,<br/>\nI believe, the other groups) want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou get this by filing a letter with the Supreme Court in compliance<br/>\nwith the applicable rules of court. While anyone can file one by<br/>\nstating their interest, we DO NOT think it is an appropriate use of<br/>\ngrassroots activism. We DO NOT want every HSC member or HSLDA member<br/>\nor grandmother or irate citizen dashing off their letters to the<br/>\nSupreme Court. There are sober, measured, legal arguments to make<br/>\nabout why depublication is appropriate, and those arguments are made<br/>\nafter researching the applicable standards, etc. The Supreme Court<br/>\nwill not be swayed positively by public outcry. In fact, it could<br/>\nbackfire, and backfire badly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Supreme Court affirms on the statutory points, then the two bad<br/>\nchoices are to either seek legislation or to do nothing and hope that<br/>\na further case is brought that can involve a better set of facts and<br/>\nbetter explanation of the issues (and reaching a better result). Both<br/>\nare very dangerous. Legislation isn&#39;t the answer because of the<br/>\nextraordinary strength of the teachers&#39; union. It is unlikely we will<br/>\nsee any legislation ultimately pass that gives us the freedom we have<br/>\ntoday. And the second choice is dangerous. I know lots of families<br/>\nthat would make terrific test case defendants -- they&#39;re<br/>\nconscientious, they actually get their kids educated, they follow the<br/>\nlaws. But we don&#39;t get to pick who the family is. As a friend of mine<br/>\nsaid, we couldn&#39;t have gotten a worse set of facts for this case if we<br/>\nhad a contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are trying to get one or more of the fanciest law firms in the<br/>\nstate to help us on taking the fangs out of this case. We know what<br/>\nwe&#39;re doing. Please let us do our jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be personally, professionally, and, as a representative of<br/>\nHSC, globally grateful if everyone on this list would calm down and<br/>\nask others to calm down. Specifically, I would ask people:<br/>\n<br/>\na. Not to write to the Supreme Court or any court.<br/>\n<br/>\nb. Not to talk to their legislators or make any public statements<br/>\nabout a need for legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\nc. Tell their neighbors, friends, lists, groups both of the above and<br/>\nto educate them about the choices available and about how panic isn&#39;t<br/>\nnecessary, marches on Sacramento aren&#39;t necessary, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish this were the type of situation where we could put the fury,<br/>\npassion and energy of the members of this list to good use. Trust me,<br/>\nif we end up having to go the legislative route, we will have that<br/>\nsituation at some points.

Mary Long is their teacher, but holds no teaching credential.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe parents said they also enrolled their children in Sunland<br/>\nChristian School, a private religious academy in Sylmar (Los Angeles<br/>\nCounty), which considers the Long children part of its independent<br/>\nstudy program and visits the home about four times a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Second District Court of Appeal ruled that California law<br/>\nrequires parents to send their children to full-time public or private<br/>\nschools or have them taught by credentialed tutors at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome homeschoolers are affiliated with private or charter schools,<br/>\nlike the Longs, but others fly under the radar completely. Many<br/>\nhomeschooling families avoid truancy laws by registering with the state<br/>\nas a private school and then enroll only their own children.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet the appeals court said state law has been clear since at least<br/>\n1953, when another appellate court rejected a challenge by<br/>\nhomeschooling parents to California&#39;s compulsory education statutes.<br/>\nThose statutes require children ages 6 to 18 to attend a full-time day<br/>\nschool, either public or private, or to be instructed by a tutor who<br/>\nholds a state credential for the child&#39;s grade level.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;California courts have held that ... parents do not have a<br/>\nconstitutional right to homeschool their children,&quot; Justice H. Walter<br/>\nCroskey said in the 3-0 ruling issued on Feb. 28. &quot;Parents have a legal<br/>\nduty to see to their children&#39;s schooling under the provisions of these<br/>\nlaws.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nParents can be criminally prosecuted for failing to comply, Croskey said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A primary purpose of the educational system is to train school<br/>\nchildren in good citizenship, patriotism and loyalty to the state and<br/>\nthe nation as a means of protecting the public welfare,&quot; the judge<br/>\nwrote, quoting from a 1961 case on a similar issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnion pleased with ruling<br/>\nThe ruling was applauded by a director for the state&#39;s largest teachers union.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;re happy,&quot; said Lloyd Porter, who is on the California Teachers<br/>\nAssociation board of directors. &quot;We always think students should be<br/>\ntaught by credentialed teachers, no matter what the setting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nA spokesman for the state Department of Education said the agency<br/>\nis reviewing the decision to determine its impact on current policies<br/>\nand procedures. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack<br/>\nO&#39;Connell issued a statement saying he supports &quot;parental choice when<br/>\nit comes to homeschooling.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, which agreed<br/>\nearlier this week to represent Sunland Christian School and legally<br/>\nadvise the Long family on a likely appeal to the state Supreme Court,<br/>\nsaid the appellate court ruling has set a precedent that can now be<br/>\nused to go after homeschoolers. &quot;With this case law, anyone in<br/>\nCalifornia who is homeschooling without a teaching credential is<br/>\nsubject to prosecution for truancy violation, which could require<br/>\ncommunity service, heavy fines and possibly removal of their children<br/>\nunder allegations of educational neglect,&quot; Dacus said.<br/>\n<br/>\nParents say they choose homeschooling for a variety of reasons,<br/>\nfrom religious beliefs to disillusionment with the local public schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling parent Debbie Schwarzer of Los Altos said she&#39;s ready for a fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchwarzer runs Oak Hill Academy out of her Santa Clara County home.<br/>\nIt is a state-registered private school with two students, she said,<br/>\nnoting they are her own children, ages 10 and 12. She does not have a<br/>\nteaching credential, but she does have a law degree.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m kind of hoping some truancy officer shows up on my doorstep,&quot; she<br/>\nsaid. &quot;I&#39;m ready. I have damn good arguments.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe opted to teach her children at home to better meet their needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ruling, Schwarzer said, &quot;stinks.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBegan as child welfare case<br/>\nThe Long family legal battle didn&#39;t start out as a test case on the<br/>\nvalidity of homeschooling. It was a child welfare case.<br/>\n<br/>\nA juvenile court judge looking into one child&#39;s complaint of<br/>\nmistreatment by Philip Long found that the children were being poorly<br/>\neducated but refused to order two of the children, ages 7 and 9, to be<br/>\nenrolled in a full-time school. He said parents in California have a<br/>\nright to educate their children at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe appeals court told the juvenile court judge to require the<br/>\nparents to comply with the law by enrolling their children in a school,<br/>\nbut excluded the Sunland Christian School from enrolling the children<br/>\nbecause that institution &quot;was willing to participate in the deprivation<br/>\nof the children&#39;s right to a legal education.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe decision could also affect other kinds of homeschooled children,<br/>\nincluding those enrolled in independent study or distance learning<br/>\nthrough public charter schools - a setup similar to the one the Longs<br/>\nhave, Dacus said.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharter school advocates disagreed, saying Thursday that charter<br/>\nschools are public and are required to employ only credentialed<br/>\nteachers to supervise students - whether in class or through<br/>\nindependent study.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuling will apply statewide<br/>\nMichael Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense<br/>\nAssociation, said the ruling would effectively ban homeschooling in the<br/>\nstate.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;California is now on the path to being the only state to deny the<br/>\nvast majority of homeschooling parents their fundamental right to teach<br/>\ntheir own children at home,&quot; he said in a statement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Leslie Heimov, executive director of the Children&#39;s Law Center<br/>\nof Los Angeles, which represented the Longs&#39; two children in the case,<br/>\nsaid the ruling did not change the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They just affirmed that the current California law, which has been<br/>\nunchanged since the last time it was ruled on in the 1950s, is that<br/>\nchildren have to be educated in a public school, an accredited private<br/>\nschool, or with an accredited tutor,&quot; she said. &quot;If they want to send<br/>\nthem to a private Christian school, they can, but they have to actually<br/>\ngo to the school and be taught by teachers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHeimov said her organization&#39;s chief concern was not the quality of<br/>\nthe children&#39;s education, but their &quot;being in a place daily where they<br/>\nwould be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing<br/>\nsafety.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/07/MNJDVF0F1.DTL\">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/07/MNJDVF0F1.DTL</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30563,"nextTopicId":30640}}
