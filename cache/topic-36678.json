Is there a real<br/>\nNeed for a young child to dig all the way to some &quot;core&quot;? The depth that<br/>\nan individual goes to at a given time is exactly as deep as they need to<br/>\ngo. Think more spiral rather than vertical. Interests can come and go in<br/>\na heartbeat, but the ones that truly resonate with a person come back<br/>\naround again and again, each time adding a new connection, new depth,<br/>\nnew richness.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider: when you are introduced to a huge, beautiful buffet (given<br/>\nthat we&#39;re smack in the middle of Food Season lol) do you grab a plate<br/>\nand sit down and eat a whole plate of mashed potatoes and only when<br/>\nyou&#39;ve &quot;thoroughly explored&quot; the mashed potatoes, then you move on to<br/>\nthe green bean casserole? Or, like most folks, do you browse the<br/>\nofferings and take bits of whatever looks interesting and then after<br/>\nhaving viewed and sampled and taken a spoonful here and a bite there,<br/>\nyou go back and take larger portions of the things that struck a chord<br/>\nwith your taste buds. And even then, you might take maybe two spoonfuls<br/>\nof a variety of things still, and then go back for bigger servings<br/>\nlater. Learning has a lot of parallels to eating - digestion and<br/>\nlearning are both internal to the individual; each person&#39;s needs and<br/>\nwants are different, each person&#39;s goals are different (some folks just<br/>\nwant to eat enough to stay alive - it can be the same oatmeal every day;<br/>\nothers specifically savor the flavors, colors, textures; others are<br/>\nexplorers, seeking out new foods, new combinations; and so on). So too<br/>\nwith learning - some folks want just the bare bones they need to get to<br/>\ntheir goal, others seek out new areas to explore all the time, and<br/>\nothers savor specific things (for example, people who relish pure<br/>\ntheoretical mathematics). Small children, particularly, haven&#39;t &#39;tasted&#39;<br/>\na lot of things just yet, so it&#39;s pretty usual for them to want to<br/>\nsample a lot of things, in rapid sequence before &#39;digging in&#39; to a whole<br/>\nplateful, just as they are more likely to graze throughout the day -<br/>\ncarrot sticks, apples, peanut butter, raisins, cereal, and so on -<br/>\nrather than eat just a couple larger meals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

While those <br/>\nare both pretty &quot;normal&quot; (at least from an unschooling perspective) <br/>\nthey take some different strategies on the parenting end of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my kids have things they dive into and really plumb the depths <br/>\nof - but they also *mostly* dabble. Its not uncommon for Ray to be <br/>\ninterested in something for a couple weeks and then drop it entirely. <br/>\nMo may get into something for a whole day and then not want to do it <br/>\nanymore - sometimes for weeks, sometimes never. They both have areas <br/>\nof interest that they keep coming back to, but never seem to really <br/>\nget fully imersed in. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different ways of learning, for sure - and its pretty <br/>\ncommon to use more than one way of learning over the course of a <br/>\nlifetime. Your dd is doing a lot of dabbling right now, that&#39;s one <br/>\nway, like sampling at a buffet but never filling a whole plate. She <br/>\nmay be cycling back to certain things, over and over. That&#39;s another <br/>\nway of learning - you &quot;nibble&quot; and wander off and then come back for <br/>\nanother &quot;bite&quot; later. She may someday settle down for a nice &quot;full <br/>\nmeal&quot; as it were, but maybe not. It all depends on how her mind <br/>\nworks. She could just as easily go on dabbling, or nibbling, or even <br/>\ndo a sort of multitasking where she nibbles and dabbles at several <br/>\ndifferent things at the same time - think of any hobbyists you know <br/>\nwho always seem to have a dozen projects going at once and you&#39;ll <br/>\nknow what I mean. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way *I&#39;ve* found to support a family member who likes to <br/>\ndabble (or any variation thereof) is to stockpile general supplies <br/>\n*and* interesting stuff.

Like we never really<br/>\n&gt; get to hone in on anything to its core...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I like a little bit of everything. For example, earlier in the year, I<br/>\nlearned to crochet.. after my initial explosion of interest cranked<br/>\nout a teddy bear and a beanie in just a week.. my interest waned and I<br/>\nmoved on to other things. However, I keep my crochet materials<br/>\navailable and now just work on an on-going project. I just recently<br/>\ncompleted a scarf that took me months to accomplish because I would go<br/>\nfor days (even weeks) without touching it, then spontaneously sit and<br/>\nwork on it for an hour or two. I usually have an initial explosion of<br/>\ninterest and then keep my materials available for little bursts of<br/>\ninterest over the course of months, or even years. I do this with just<br/>\nabout everything. The trick is, to keep the materials of the most<br/>\ninteresting things of the time available and ready to use.  I get<br/>\nbored with the &#39;same thing,&#39; so I keep my options open with several<br/>\ninterests and always expanding that list of interests and things I<br/>\nwish to learn or try. Just keep the materials out and about and maybe<br/>\nshe&#39;ll return for another burst. I do have lifelong interests, but my<br/>\nparticipation waxes and wanes throughout my life. I have always loved<br/>\nmusic, but have gone years without playing an instrument - only to<br/>\nrediscover the enjoyment later down the road when something reminds me<br/>\nout of the blue... but, there are similarities between music and other<br/>\ninterests I have. Like, my mom used to say that reading music was like<br/>\na different language to her. It is... and I see a similarity between<br/>\nmy love of &quot;different languages,&quot; like music, actual different<br/>\nlanguages, and I learned HTML, which is a &quot;language.&quot; They all came<br/>\nvery easy to me.. but, many people wouldn&#39;t recognize the similarity<br/>\nbetween playing a song on an instrument and building a website - it&#39;s<br/>\nlanguage.<br/>\n<br/>\nTreat many of her interests as if you know they will return at some<br/>\npoint, because many of them will show up again and again.. and,<br/>\nsometimes the interest in the subject may not be instantly<br/>\nrecognizable by you. She may be pursuing something that you don&#39;t<br/>\nrealize. I ask myself questions about my current interests, like.. Why<br/>\ndo I enjoy this? What interested me about learning this? and those<br/>\nanswers usually provide some insight that I didn&#39;t realize when I<br/>\nbegan. Similarities, in my projects & interests, that weren&#39;t<br/>\ncompletely obvious... such as, the way they stimulate & challenge my<br/>\nmind, or the subtle skills of concentration or eye-hand coordination<br/>\nthey build, or intricacies and beauty that I see in the things that<br/>\nother folks may not initially notice.

Rather than being before  <br/>\nhim, showing him, walk beside him and help him explore what interests  <br/>\nhim in the ways that interest him. *Do* point out new things that  <br/>\nmight interest him. Do be ready to move where he goes when he&#39;s not  <br/>\ninterested.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s the added factor that kids need to be developmentally  <br/>\nready to read. While we can &quot;teach&quot; them history, eg, run information  <br/>\nby them and many of them will absorb something, teaching reading  <br/>\nisn&#39;t the same. It&#39;s no more effective than teaching a child to ride  <br/>\na bicycle. We can end up thinking we were responsible, but ultimately  <br/>\nwe&#39;re just waving our hands and the kids are figuring it out through  <br/>\ntrial and error.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s a way of saying look first towards what you think *he* might  <br/>\n&gt;&gt; enjoy, not at<br/>\n&gt;&gt; what you think would be a fun activity, if you see the difference.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Im having trouble understanding the differentiation there<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Actually I&#39;m not exactly sure what I meant either ;-) I think I meant  <br/>\noffer without  a hidden agenda.

This would help him. I&#39;d really like him to enjoy  <br/>\ndoing this.&quot; Those thoughts don&#39;t go through our heads when  <br/>\ninteracting with a friend or partner. Even if we do slip into that  <br/>\nkind of thinking with a friend (like when they&#39;re having a problem  <br/>\nand we think we know what they should do to fix it), we at least have  <br/>\nthe understanding that we don&#39;t have the power to make them change.  <br/>\nBut we can unconsciously believe that we have the power to mold and  <br/>\nshape a child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Because it looks like something fun that my child will enjoy and  <br/>\n&gt; will also help him<br/>\n&gt; &#39;learn&#39; letters/words/whatever.

But here&#39;s the key to your question: &quot;to give them  <br/>\nsomething which is educational.&quot; You&#39;re dividing the world into  <br/>\neducational and fun. Some things are educational, like painting  <br/>\nletters. Some things, like throwing water at the fence (for instance)  <br/>\nisn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor unschoolers, it&#39;s *all* educational. Kids are *always* learning.  <br/>\nIf something is driving them to explore something, they are truly and  <br/>\nprofoundly learning. The problem is it doesn&#39;t look like learning we  <br/>\nrecognize. We can&#39;t know what connections they&#39;re making, what  <br/>\ndiscoveries. And if we guess, it seems trivial compared to painting  <br/>\nletters which feels like a step that leads to something concretely  <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time unschooler can sit with a child and draw letters on a  <br/>\nMagna Doodle together and it be unschooling. A worried new unschooler  <br/>\ncan sit with a child and draw letters on a Magna Doodle and feel the  <br/>\nknot loosen in her stomach that her child is finally moving towards  <br/>\n&quot;important knowledge&quot;. It&#39;s not the actions that make it unschooling  <br/>\nor not. It&#39;s the state of the mom&#39;s mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And how did you all get away from these kind of ulterior motives?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Slowly.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy reading a lot. By observing and seeing the real learning  <br/>\nhappening. When they come and say &quot;There&#39;s 9 feet in 3 yards,&quot; that  <br/>\nthey heard on a commercial for Fruit Rollups.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou realize they are putting the pieces of the puzzle together in  <br/>\ntheir own way and seeing the picture evolving without us pointing it  <br/>\nout. And you realize they&#39;re doing that by watching TV and playing  <br/>\nvideo games and throwing water against the fence ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; After all, why read a story when you can watch the movie faster and  <br/>\n&gt; more vividly ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*If* that&#39;s the reason for taking in a story. Reading has it&#39;s  <br/>\nadvantages and disadvantages. Movies have their advantages and  <br/>\ndisadvantages. So does listening on tape. So does listening to a  <br/>\nstory teller. Doing something else entirely has its advantages and  <br/>\ndisadvantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith movies we don&#39;t get much inside characters&#39; heads. All we see is  <br/>\ntheir external reactions. That&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s just different. But  <br/>\nthe beauty is, that without making kids read instead of watch movies  <br/>\nbecause reading is supposedly superior, they have the freedom to  <br/>\nexplore what they like and dislike about each media, draw conclusions  <br/>\nabout which is better for what they want this particular time. We&#39;ve  <br/>\nread Harry Potter. We&#39;ve listened to it on tape. We&#39;ve watched the  <br/>\nmovies.

The moment you add &quot;we <br/>\ncould paint letters&quot; you&#39;ve morphed the idea into an &quot;activity&quot; in <br/>\nthe sense I think the other poster meant.

He plays with words and sounds and <br/>\nletters and phrases on a regular basis. Ray&#39;s interested, but mostly <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested in the social aspect - he wants to get laughs and <br/>\ngroans like his dad! But he&#39;s not terribly interested in the process <br/>\nof exploring language, so over time he&#39;s found other ways to be an <br/>\nentertainer. Mo, otoh, shares George&#39;s love of language. She&#39;s not <br/>\nas skilled, yet, but she&#39;s working on it - she sort of &quot;raps&quot; in a <br/>\nway, playing out loud with sound and word combinations and giggling <br/>\nover rhymes and alliteration and crowing when she actually comes up <br/>\nwith a pun. Sometimes she and George swap words back and forth in a <br/>\nsort of free-association language game. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the point of all that is that this is something that George <br/>\nloves to do. Its one of his hobbies, if you like. Its not something <br/>\nhe&#39;s tried to actively involve the kids in - they see/hear him doing <br/>\nit and want to play, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf words and letters interest you, play with them. Embroider a <br/>\nsampler or learn caligraphy. Play with stencils. Write poetry if you <br/>\nlike! Or a journal or blog. Get a dozen sets of magnetic fridge <br/>\nletters or words and play with them bc You enjoy it. If your guy <br/>\nwants to play, too, great. But, just suppose he uses the letters to <br/>\nmake pictures instead of using them &quot;as letters&quot; - what then? Well, <br/>\nyou could get a set of shape magnets too, so he has more/different <br/>\noptions to choose from. Play with letters by all means!

Because I never had the idea of sitting <br/>\nhim down for any kind of lessons. Or any of those things where the child has to trace letters, or sound out letters. You get the idea. I think what I was wanting to do was <br/>\na lot more unschooly than even i thought it was. I definitely dont have some preconception or goal on when he will be reading by. You have all given me a lot to think <br/>\nabout. Mostly because Im not really sure myself what my &#39;goal&#39; was. Im not really sure what I thought the reading would look like. Since I know I wouldnt have forced <br/>\nanything he didnt want to do and I dont seem to have some set idea about his age once he could read. So it seems to be more activities for the sake of the enjoyment they <br/>\ngive us.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If a child is reading at 6 instead of 7, what does the child gain? <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are they better at being 6?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I guess it doesnt matter in our (RUers)  lives, life is just life, reading is really inconsequential day to day.

And also didnt think of  the the thing mentioned about documentaries and you tube etc to teach <br/>\nyou/entertain you verbally. Besides I am starting to see with things like the internet, if I am right *there* with him, I can help him to find whatever he&#39;s looking for that <br/>\nmay require reading. Im also *there* to help by reading something out to him in general life as well. We do read lots of books (always his initiative- he loves to bring <br/>\nbooks and snuggle up to read).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on <br/>\n&gt; the floors.<br/>\n&gt; Painting words on the back fence.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if *he* doesn&#39;t think this is fun?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we wouldnt do it. I tend to offer options only if he seems to need something to do, most of the time he knows what he wants to do at any given moment and is <br/>\nwanting to play whatever that is. I was thinking more that it would be yet another available activity which he can pull out and we can play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s not a way of saying don&#39;t paint giant letters.

I guess I am realizing that all I really want is for him to be able to read one day, <br/>\nor should I say when he needs it! Im starting to see that I never felt it has to be at some specific time, and therefore is likely to be a gradual process spanning years <br/>\nanyway. I think my vision was fairly unschooly to begin with, I just didnt realize it was :) Its so good figuring this all out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you want some part of the credit for your child&#39;s process?

It has nothing to do with outsiders thinking he *should* be able to. I dont want him to be able to <br/>\nread for any sense of parental pride. The process itself I wanted to do because I think it would be fun to explore letters, and words etc in an exciting and playful way. The <br/>\nactual outcome had nothing to with the &#39;teaching&#39; I was wanting to do. It was more in the name of fun and exploration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; - are you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>introducing this because you think it looks like something fun that your<br/>\nchild will enjoy or are you introducing it because it&#39;ll be good to<br/>\n&#39;teach&#39; reading?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood question! Im not even sure. I guess both ;) Because it looks like something fun that my child will enjoy and will also help him &#39;learn&#39; letters/words/whatever on some <br/>\nlevel too. I would like to know more about why this is bad, to give them something which is educational, with the intention that they will pick up something/anything from <br/>\nit? Even if there is no expectation that they will, but the hope I guess is still there. And how did you all get away from these kind of ulterior motives?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The funny thing is that I thought that while living for a year in Japan where I could read nothing that wasn&#39;t written in the Latin alphabet and yet David and I could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>negotiate our way around Kyoto and Osaka and other parts of Japan often with less difficulty than I find getting around places where English is the written <br/>\nlanguage.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting, so I guess if I looked at reading itself the same way I look at, say, talking then I could let it go more easily. In that Im not going to play talking and sounding <br/>\ngames (etc) to &#39;teach&#39; him to talk faster and beyond his ability and desire.

Another great way to learn. Maybe I have been <br/>\nputting all the &#39;learning&#39; stuff into one box, in other words, the only way he can learn things (when he wants to learn them) is to be able to read everything.

Still he leads his own learning all the time. He surfs youtube a lot. Two days ago he found the Animaniacs Macarana song (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bjOePNFRFRU)\">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bjOePNFRFRU)</a> because Linnaea had been singing it in the car when we came back from roller skating, and finding it was a gift that he gave to her. I don&#39;t know how he negotiated his way through to the song. I&#39;ve watched him do it with other things. He couldn&#39;t remember the name of a series that he had been watching, but he knew where it was in a list of things and he found it that way. He sees things that I miss, he hears things that I miss. I use written words to help me negotiate through so many things, but he uses all these other cues. I think he often has a more accurate picture of what&#39;s going on, or at least one that is informed by more sources, than I do. He knows more of Harry Potter than I do as he has listened and relistened to Jim Dale and Stephen Fry read it<br/>\n to him. I&#39;ve read it, but I skim read. He listens with intensity. He observes with intensity, as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI used to think that reading was a necessary early step in education. The funny thing is that I thought that while living for a year in Japan where I could read nothing that wasn&#39;t written in the Latin alphabet and yet David and I could negotiate our way around Kyoto and Osaka and other parts of Japan often with less difficulty than I find getting around places where English is the written language. It was fun ordering in restaurants. In Japan it is normal to have plastic versions of what&#39;s on the menu in the window. I can remember once David had to work a bit to get the waitress to go out with him to the front of the restaurant to point at what we wanted to eat. Or when I had to ask for tampons at a pharmacy. The poor girl was so embarrassed when she finally got what I wanted. I laughed and she laughed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon isn&#39;t ready to read yet. The neurological blocks that he needs to do so aren&#39;t in place yet. He isn&#39;t stupid or slow, nor is he left out of the world of knowledge because of that lack. He is so knowledgeable and so capable. The most amazing thing to me is that he doesn&#39;t feel stupid or slow to not be reading. Linnaea, who is 8, started reading at 6 and Simon was quite comfortable turning to her and asking her to read things to him, he still is. He never felt challenged by her ability. He doesn&#39;t compare himself with her. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com\">http://www.waynforth.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: logan_rose_porter &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:logan_rose_porter@...\">logan_rose_porter@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 23 October, 2008 9:11:10 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Cant I JUST teach him to READ????<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHey all :) <br/>\n<br/>\nIm struggling with the idea of not being &#39;allowed&#39; to teach my son to read. For what its <br/>\nworth we started with the idea he would go to an alternative should (I really liked <br/>\nsteiner/waldorf- but hated montessori) which quickly transitioned to homeshooling after <br/>\nhe was born and I couldnt imagine our days/lives being ruled by school, nor being apart <br/>\nfrom him. We were already AP and as soon as I learned what US (and then RU) were I knew <br/>\nit was for us. But during the part where I knew I would homeschool I got really excited <br/>\nabout being able to teach him to read. Im not interested in giving him lessons in any <br/>\nsubjects. I believe his interests will lead us into many fascinating subjects naturally. I also <br/>\nwant to make sure he has plenty of excursions and interesting toys etc...so the world is at <br/>\nhis door so to speak. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am really struggling with this reading thing. I would never force him to sit down and <br/>\nlearn it. I was more excited to do things like playing with giant letters on the floors. <br/>\nPainting words on the back fence.

It doesn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nActivities can help a child perform actions that look like reading or  <br/>\nprereading, like sounding out letters or writing the alphabet or  <br/>\nwriting particular words. But does being able to do those things make  <br/>\na child read sooner? Well, it depends.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst a child needs to be developmentally ready. There are several  <br/>\nbrain areas involved in being able to decode. Not all the areas  <br/>\nmature at the same time. Not all the areas mature at the same age for  <br/>\nall kids. Teachers can train kids to sound out the alphabet -- which  <br/>\nseems like almost reading -- and yet the child isn&#39;t developmentally  <br/>\nready to put it all together. And by a teacher continuing to press  <br/>\nforward to get the kid over what seems like a hump, the child can  <br/>\nbegin to feel like there&#39;s something wrong with him. Some kids aren&#39;t  <br/>\ndevelopmentally ready to put it all together until they&#39;re 12. That&#39;s  <br/>\n6 or more years of going through the motions of reading. They could  <br/>\nhave been doing so much more with that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, if a child can perform the actions, do they read sooner?<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet you could train a child to move their legs as though they were  <br/>\nwalking. Just because it looked like walking, would they be walking  <br/>\nsooner? Would it help? When they were 10 would anyone see a difference?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn *school* it makes a difference because kids need to be reading  <br/>\nindependtly by 4th grade because that&#39;s what the curriculum needs.  <br/>\n(But schools don&#39;t get all kids to read then. The nonreaders are  <br/>\nshuttled off to special programs.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I guess it stems from the belief<br/>\n&gt; that if you can read you can learn anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a child is reading at 6 instead of 7, what does the child gain?  <br/>\nAre they better at being 6?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child doesn&#39;t read until 12, are they 6 years behind?  As a  <br/>\nmatter of fact no, they&#39;re shortly reading at age level. Have they  <br/>\nmissed out? No. Hopefully they&#39;ve been read to and been listening to  <br/>\nthings on tape if they want. And they&#39;ve been learning in ways that  <br/>\nare much more meaningful *to them*.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause schools have adopted books as a convenient way to get  <br/>\ninformation into kids, we&#39;ve thoroughly devalued all other means of  <br/>\nlearning.

For what its <br/>\nworth we started with the idea he would go to an alternative should (I really liked <br/>\nsteiner/waldorf- but hated montessori) which quickly transitioned to homeshooling after <br/>\nhe was born and I couldnt imagine our days/lives being ruled by school, nor being apart <br/>\nfrom him. We were already AP and as soon as I learned what US (and then RU) were I knew <br/>\nit was for us. But during the part where I knew I would homeschool I got really excited <br/>\nabout being able to teach him to read. Im not interested in giving him lessons in any <br/>\nsubjects. I believe his interests will lead us into many fascinating subjects naturally. I also <br/>\nwant to make sure he has plenty of excursions and interesting toys etc...so the world is at <br/>\nhis door so to speak. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am really struggling with this reading thing.
