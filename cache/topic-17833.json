This has  <br/>\ntime until he asks how the letter R would be pronounced or when it  <br/>\ncomes up naturally. I have English groups for kids aged 1-6 here in  <br/>\nGermany, and they have the same &quot;problem&quot;, they say it like a &quot;w&quot; or  <br/>\n&quot;u&quot;. But when I have showed them my tongue, how it rolls back,  and  <br/>\ndrew them pictures of how it looks like in the mouth and when I have  <br/>\nshowed with my hand how the tongue rolls back, they have usually  <br/>\ngotten it very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreetings<br/>\nJohanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAm 04.10.2006 um 04:33 schrieb sara_boheme:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; My ds is almost 7 and still pronounces his &quot;R&quot;s with a w sound.

Three years ago, during a traditional pediatrician &quot;well visit&quot;, our pediatrician suggested we take ds for speech therapy.  I did.  When I met with the therapist, I told her, &quot;This is Nikolas.  He has trouble getting stuck.  We need your help to unstick him.&quot;.  She laughed as if I was being funny and began &quot;treatment&quot; of Nik.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As I sat through session after session, there was nothing that she did that I could not.  She blew bubbles with him, asked him to slow down, modeled &quot;correct&quot; speech, read with him, worked on articulation, and a few more things.  Nothing earth shattering.  Nikolas really liked her and the time he spent with her.  So, we continued.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  One day, she came out of the session visably frustrated.  She told me that she was no longer able to treat Nik because &quot;he doesn&#39;t realize he has a problem&quot; she said.  I told her that he never did have a problem and reiterated what I had told her on our first day.  We never went back.  She recommended all sorts of treatment options and whatnot.  No thanks.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Four years later, Nik still has &quot;speech issues&quot; (mostly articulation).  We choose to listen carefully to him and help him through it as necessary.  We have never labeled him as anything other than Nikolas (not speech impaired, needing speech anything).  I can tell you for a fact that his speech is *much* better than when he was being &quot;treated&quot; and he is, in fact, growing into more normal speech.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I wouldn&#39;t take him to therapy again unless he requested it.  With us, it just wasn&#39;t necessary to Nik nor to me.  Yup, some people he doesn&#39;t know have trouble understanding him, but, those who take the time to really listen are easily able to understand.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hth some, <br/>\n  Jane<br/>\n  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jane Powell <br/>\n  Tribe&#39;s Partner<br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;You must be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot; - Gandhi <br/>\n   <br/>\n  &quot;There is no right way to do the wrong thing.&quot; - unknown <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nTalk is cheap.
