It&#39;s kind of a combination <br/>\nof these&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI wholly agree that there is no difference in the athletic ability, skill, dedication, etc. between cheerleading, gymnastics, and dance.  My two daughters, ages 10 1/2 and 7 1/2 both are involved in competitive cheerleading and have been for three years now.  When my oldest daughter was two, she would beg to watch ESPN cheer tournaments.  (She discovered them one day when we turned on the tv and it was already tuned to ESPN from a prior game and cheerleading was on.)  She wanted madly to cheer for years and we signed her up as soon as we found a program.  The biggest reason we signed her up, besides her wild desire, was because it was never in the plan that she would be in a school, her only option to cheer was competitive.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat said, both my daughters love it.  It is very expensive, with uniforms and competitions.  Often my girls ask why can&#39;t we do this, go there, or buy that.  When I explain we could do those other things or we can cheer, they always say cheer.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAll cheerleaders and coaches know the effort put forth by the athletes, and here in Illinois they have been officially acknowledged as athletes.  However, we have participated in two gyms that also have dance, tumbling, and gymnastics.  In both gyms, my daughters have learned discrimination from tumbling coaches who should know better.  In the first gym we were affiliated with, one tumbling coach repeatedly made comments to his tumblers when they shared the floor with the cheerleaders about how they were better tumblers and should show us how it is done.  In our current gym, the tumbling coach told the cheerleaders that they had to move off the official &quot;cheer floor&quot; to make room for his tumblers because they are better and deserve more room.  This was from coaches who knew the time, effort, skill, etc. yet they still make thoughtless comments.  Cheerleaders only learn select tumble moves that they use and never learn some of the basics, like handstands, therefore most tumbling coaches we have encountered look down on the skills of the cheerleaders, even though there is much the cheerleaders do, that the tumblers cannot.  The coaches have definitely passed this attitude to their students, as I have seen tumblers 8 years old put down the cheerleaders because of tumbling.  The issue of slutiness, and cultural stereotypes has never come up in any instance since we started.<br/>\n <br/>\nNever being in school allows my children the freedom from cliques, stereotypes, and reputations so common in school.  However, they still do experience a different type of attitude about cheerleaders.  And for the record, when my daughters tell me of the comments, and some I have heard myself, they tell me like &quot;Can you believe what he said?  He doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about.&quot;  I am always way more bothered than they are.<br/>\n <br/>\nNo matter what you choose in life, you will have someone who disagrees.  As unschoolers, you are already changing the stereotypes of the public.  As cheerleaders, your daughters (or your sons) can change other stereotypes as well.<br/>\n <br/>\nWay more than my two cents,<br/>\n <br/>\nMindy <br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nCheck out the new AOL.

It was a low budget community affair (AYOP, aka America&#39;s Youth Outreach Program) and the girls outfits were usually oversized, boxy and not at all sexy. They were encouraged to wear long sleaved turtlenecks to keep warm under the tops, which were not tight adn had short sleeves and a modest scooped neck. And this is in california. They kept the young girls in very modest attire. She enjoyed it and had a ton of fun. The meets were also fun and full of good natured competition. I had a great time with the parents in the stands. By age 13, she did not want to do it anymore. <br/>\nMy older daughter, on the other hand, goes to public high school and really wanted to try out for cheerleading because she discovered a love for and an ability to dance. But she did not try out because the new cheerleading coach required &quot;too provocative&quot; routines and she &quot;did not want to dance like a ho.&quot; (her words). I was so pissed off at that because it was something she really wanted to do. When you watch the competitions on TV, you see that there is a lot of atheticism in cheerleading, and the routines you see in competition are not really very provocative. I have seen more offensive stuff in music videos. I also kind of liked the movie &quot;Bring it On.&quot; I had a friend who would not let her daughter see the movie because it was about cheerleaders but there were some positive messages in that movie. <br/>\nLots of sports require girls to dress in attire that is skimpier than cheerleading outfits. Ice skating, gymnastics, swimming, trapeze artistry, etc. <br/>\nI think you should let her try it out. She may decide she doesnt like it. You may find you do like it. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: Karen &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kldickson@...\">kldickson@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 10/01/07, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a> &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:singdoula@...\">singdoula@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Adriana wrote: my daughter who is normally NOT into anything pink, thinks<br/>\n&gt; princess are lame<br/>\n&gt; because they need to be &quot;rescued&quot; and is quite the little feminist<br/>\n&gt; recently<br/>\n&gt; asked if she could join a CHEERLEADING class at gymnastics (and wear the<br/>\n&gt; uniform and stuff)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had a similar situation which has quietly died down for the time<br/>\nbeing.

It has also <br/>\nalways <br/>\n&gt; bothered me  that they are on the sidelines cheering (and <br/>\nseducing) instead of  <br/>\n&gt; playing the sport. In professional sports they are revered  as <br/>\nathletic show-girls <br/>\n&gt; and regularly are in centerfold calendars. In  schools they are <br/>\ntalked about <br/>\n&gt; as &quot;the girls you want to land.&quot; On the  other hand, cheerleading <br/>\nrequires a <br/>\n&gt; TREMENDOUS amount of dedication,  athleticism, commitment, and <br/>\nability. And <br/>\n&gt; when I strip down all the &quot;ick&quot;  factors, it looks like a ton of <br/>\nfun. The outfit <br/>\n&gt; TRULY bothers me and just  looks plain old whore-ish, blught!

I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; look at  tennis players and think &quot;little slut&quot; and those outfits <br/>\nlook almost  <br/>\n&gt; exactly the same.

I certainly wouldn&#39;t put all that <br/>\non my young daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent much of my young life cheerleading, and I loved it.  My <br/>\nfamily was into sports, and my dad did coaching and refereeing, so I <br/>\nwas around that a lot.  I started at a very young age as a sort of <br/>\nmascot, cheering alongside my older sisters.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first met my husband, I was just out of high school, and let <br/>\nme tell you, he was shocked when I told him I had been a <br/>\ncheerleader.  And I was shocked when he told me that the <br/>\ncheerleaders at his school were viewed as &quot;sluts&quot; and that none of <br/>\nthem were nice at all.  It wasn&#39;t that way at my school.  In fact, I <br/>\nnever had a boyfriend at all during my high school years.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheerleading has become more and more a sport in its own right over <br/>\nthe years, and there are competitions and such.  Do most people <br/>\nreally see cheerleaders in such a negative way?  Maybe I&#39;m being <br/>\nnaive, but how is it really any different than other ways of <br/>\nperforming, such as gymnastics or dance?  It&#39;s kind of a combination <br/>\nof these, as well as adding to the atmosphere of games by getting <br/>\nthe crowd more involved and giving the fans something else to watch <br/>\nduring timeouts or breaks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t seen the outfit, but like you said, it is not much <br/>\ndifferent than a tennis outfit.  Gymnasts generally wear leotards.  <br/>\nSwimmers wear swimsuits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not tell your daughter how cheerleaders are viewed because <br/>\nnot everyone feels this way.  As far as your mother and friends, do <br/>\nthey really think that ALL cheerleaders are a certain way, or does <br/>\nit just bother them that some people might think your daughter is a <br/>\ncertain way because she is a cheerleader?  A lot of people have <br/>\ncertain ideas about homeschoolers too, but that doesn&#39;t make them <br/>\ntrue.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike you said, your daughter thinks it looks fun.  Why not let her <br/>\ntry it out?  If it isn&#39;t fun, she won&#39;t want to do it anymore, <br/>\nright?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-Christy M.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, singdoula@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; my daughter who is normally NOT into anything pink,  thinks <br/>\nprincess are lame <br/>\n&gt; because they need to be &quot;rescued&quot; and is quite  the little <br/>\nfeminist recently <br/>\n&gt; asked if she could join a CHEERLEADING class  at gymnastics (and <br/>\nwear the <br/>\n&gt; uniform and stuff) I told her yes because I  really believe she <br/>\nshould be able to <br/>\n&gt; try out whatever she is interested in  and decide on her own what <br/>\nshe thinks <br/>\n&gt; about it but I am FREAKING OUT  INSIDE because of the negative <br/>\nfeelings I have <br/>\n&gt; about cheerleading and  cheerleaders especially these days when <br/>\nthey make such <br/>\n&gt; sexually  inappropriate gestures in their routines!
