My role at the school has changed - our<br/>\nyearlong program has a few dozen graduates now (some of the most<br/>\nhighly aware and self-knowing people I&#39;ve ever met), and part of our<br/>\nvision for growing into ourselves and for feeding the native lifeway<br/>\nis to have a place where these graduates can return to and carry on<br/>\ntheir learning.  That place is called Mashkodens - little prairie camp<br/>\n- a 10 minute walk through the woods behind the school center.  I have<br/>\nlived there since last green season where myself and others have built<br/>\nthe foundations of a live, full-time native camp.  While Mashkodens&#39;<br/>\ndoor is always open to yearlong graduates, we also offer one-moon<br/>\nimmersions to people interested in learning by example and experience<br/>\nwhat it is to live natively (to have one&#39;s means and ends intimately<br/>\nconnected, to live in the moment without distraction, to be as a<br/>\ncircle, to gather, to cook primitively, to travel with the turn in the<br/>\nseasons and embrace the gifts of the Mother whether they be snowshoe<br/>\nhare, suckerfish or blueberries).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first time we are going to have a child participate in a Wild<br/>\nMoon: 4 year old Luuk with his mother and her partner (who is a<br/>\nyearlong graduate).  Energy is shifting all over the school to<br/>\ncapitalize on this major opportunity; the parents living at the school<br/>\nare facing fears of their own and re-arranging plans and possible<br/>\nliving arrangements to be more present at Mashkodens, offering their<br/>\nown children a chance to build community with Luuk at the camp.  I&#39;m<br/>\nadvertising the time in which they come (Raspberry Moon: August 1-29)<br/>\nas a &quot;Children&#39;s Moon,&quot; and inviting any parents interested in<br/>\nparticipating to join us for a Wild Moon!  <br/>\n<br/>\nfor more details, pictures and application see our webpage @ <br/>\nwww.teachingdrum.org/livinglearning.html<br/>\n<br/>\nLet this be an unfolding of learning in relationship with children<br/>\nthat I can see we all hunger for!<br/>\n-marcus</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33121,"nextTopicId":33281}}
