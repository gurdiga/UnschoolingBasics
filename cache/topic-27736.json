I wanted to put up a <br/>\nsmall intro about me and my family. We are currently in seattle looking <br/>\nto move to WNY/Derby area. I have a 6yr old and 8yr old boy(s). We have <br/>\nbeen unschooling for 2 yrs now. My older son was in Public School for 3 <br/>\nyrs for Dev. preschool for his autism. Now he is home. We have some <br/>\nhard times with him but overall he is doing wonderful. !! <br/>\nI am in a bit of a dilema. Well I want to very badly move back to NY to <br/>\nbe with my family but they are not welcoming to the homeschool/unschool <br/>\nideas. Being 3000 miles away makes it easier to do. My mom is a teacher <br/>\nin the lake shore school. I really want to continue unschooling but I <br/>\nam also afraid it will interfere with my family. Also I see that it is <br/>\nvery hard to homeschool in NY&gt;<br/>\nAny advice would be wonderful.<br/>\nTHanks<br/>\nKasey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27722,"nextTopicId":27739}}
