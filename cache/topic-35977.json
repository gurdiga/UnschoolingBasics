(Which coincided with when I could see a more  <br/>\nadult view of the world developing in her.) It&#39;s because I *didn&#39;t*  <br/>\nmake her clean up but asked if she&#39;d help me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn&#39;t, though, always perfect! Occasionally I did have my  <br/>\ndemanding periods and I could see and feel the difference in her  <br/>\nreactions. I could feel her resentment and withdrawal when I made her  <br/>\n(when I left cleaning until the last minute before company.) I became  <br/>\nsomeone she wanted to avoid. (And by association, she wanted to avoid  <br/>\nwhat I wanted her to do.) When I retained full control of what I  <br/>\nwanted done and asked for her help -- and treated the time she gave  <br/>\nme as a gift even if her help wasn&#39;t huge -- I behaved as someone she  <br/>\nenjoyed helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, when he asked them to clean up<br/>\n&gt; the beads from the kitchen floor last night, it was because they  <br/>\n&gt; were in<br/>\n&gt; the way<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if they&#39;d said no? Would that be okay?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s asking, yes or no *should* be acceptable answers. Otherwise  <br/>\nit&#39;s a demand disguised as a question.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids see right through that but unfortunately parents don&#39;t. Parents  <br/>\nthink they&#39;re being polite by phrasing a demand as a question but  <br/>\nit&#39;s really just dishonesty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and he just wants them to learn to move their things out of the<br/>\n&gt; way for safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When we impose lessons on someone, they often learn a lesson  <br/>\ndifferent from the one we intend. When we make kids clean or just  <br/>\nmove things for safety, they don&#39;t absorb the sensibleness of the  <br/>\nidea. They absorb that when  you&#39;re big you get to make weaker people  <br/>\ndo what you want. Right now those little people often have to beg and  <br/>\nplead and hope that a big person might find their request worthy of  <br/>\nthe big person&#39;s time. Being able to make someone do what you want --  <br/>\nas your husband is modeling for them -- would be a time to look  <br/>\nforward to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur values -- and we! -- look way more attractive if we put the  <br/>\nenergy into the values that we feel they&#39;re worth rather than  <br/>\nimposing the values on someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you valued vegetarianism? For lots of people vegetarianism  <br/>\nmakes sense. Would he embrace and love and see the sensibleness in  <br/>\nvegetarianism if you made him cook vegetarian meals and made him eat  <br/>\nvegetarian meals?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if, instead, you started cooking vegetarian meals for yourself  <br/>\nand added meat in for the rest of the family so they could choose  <br/>\nvegetarian or not? They could try it occasionally when it felt right  <br/>\nto them or not when they didn&#39;t. So they had a *choice*.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But, I suggested that he get down and help them, rather<br/>\n&gt; than ordering them to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suggest he get down and do it and ask if they&#39;d like to help. And  <br/>\nbe okay if they say &quot;No.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOften it helps to make specific requests like &quot;Hey, could you hand me  <br/>\nthe bin to put these beads in?&quot; Invite them to join in rather than  <br/>\ndemanding they do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He says it&#39;s their stuff and they should<br/>\n&gt; be the ones at least pushing it to the side.

So he made  <br/>\nthem go to internment camps and made them go into executioners chambers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen two people disagree, is the best way we can think up to resolve  <br/>\nthe differences for the stronger side to make the other side comply?  <br/>\n*Is* that the way he wants to model resolving conflicts for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a big *huge* factor is that the kids aren&#39;t developmentally ready  <br/>\nto see the world through adult eyes. It&#39;s not a matter of not  <br/>\nunderstanding. It&#39;s a matter that they really can&#39;t see the world  <br/>\nthrough the lens he wants them to. They will be able to when they&#39;re  <br/>\nolder *because* they&#39;re older, not because they&#39;ve been taught.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Maybe, if they&#39;re precocious, they might grasp the safety factor  <br/>\njust as some kids can precociously read at 3. But it doesn&#39;t help  <br/>\nthem grasp it sooner to assume they should grasp it any more than it  <br/>\nwill help a 3 yo read by assuming they should be able to just because  <br/>\nthe neighbor&#39;s child can.
