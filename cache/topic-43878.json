Kids aren&#39;t interested in the rest - they don&#39;t Want all the choices in the world. Lets be rrrrreeeeeaaaaallllly clear about that! Those &quot;critical years&quot; when food is sooooo important are years when kids are Happy to eat what&#39;s in the house. They want to make decisions about when and how to eat from what&#39;s readily available. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere around 4ish, things change. There&#39;s a shift in what kids are ready for, developmentally, and they let you know it by asking for more. That&#39;s when they start wanting to be part of the process of choosing what comes into the house - making decisions in the store, and even wanting to explore different stores. At the same time, their palates tend to narrow - its a &quot;safty device&quot; if you will. Wanting to explore is good, but tasting everything in the world isn&#39;t. So they want lots of things that give &quot;safe&quot; messages. Make plenty available! But also realize they&#39;re going to want a say in those &quot;safe&quot; choices. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: thank you & goodbye","postDate":"1273512853","msgId":43937,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhzOWcybCtvb3NlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHIybWJjY2YyYjM1MTAwNTA5MTU1OGxjZjRjMWZlYXplMDU2YTI1NjU0ZWM0Yjk4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43925,"nextInTopic":43938,"prevInTime":43936,"nextInTime":43938,"topicId":43878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Different people have different perspectives. Different bodies will have different reactions to food and different personalities will develop different relationships with food. So what you&#39;re really saying, from a child&#39;s perspective, is &quot;this maybe might happen to have some effect that you maybe might happen to not be thrilled with in seven or eight or your lifetimes&quot;. Its gibberish to a child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you disagree with his choices to the point that its damaging your relationship, that&#39;s something to notice and think about. Maybe you can change your perspective. Maybe you can disregard his perspective. The main thing is to step away from the assumption that you can somehow Give another person your perspective.

Your words are less valuable to him than his direct experience, and his direct experience is that you&#39;re wrong, and thus untrustworthy as a source of information. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s eating a lot of things that worry you, it can help to consider any other factors, besides the ingredients, that make those things more attractive than other foods. Children *will* choose foods that are more convenient and more attractive, so its very important to make nutritionally dense foods that are both. But children also often do very well with lots and lots of nutritionally sparse foods - lots of refined flours and sugars, with just small amounts of foods with more vitamins and enzymes. They don&#39;t need as much of those things as we may think. A &quot;single serving&quot; of fruit for a child is tiny - a couple grapes. Its nothing, by adult standards. A full cup of juice can easily contain all the nutrition, apart from raw calories, that a kid needs (and a kid who needs more will eat more!). <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thank you & goodbye","postDate":"1273459015","msgId":43925,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDNkQwRUEzLURBMEYtNDY3RS1CRTJFLUE2RTgzNkIzMzVFM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhydmoybCtxZWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhydmoybCtxZWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43924,"nextInTopic":43937,"prevInTime":43924,"nextInTime":43926,"topicId":43878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Before 4 Kathryn had a wide  <br/>\nvariety of foods she enjoyed and was very adventurous with food. And  <br/>\nthen her choices started narrowing and remained limited until she was  <br/>\n12. Then they broadened again and she&#39;d try anything.

Liver? Raw onions? What  <br/>\nif your husband had discussions about how you needed to eat  <br/>\ndifferently and why? But his discussions didn&#39;t change the  <br/>\ngagworthiness of the food you once enjoyed.

He&#39;s four.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is three and would live on peanut butter and jelly if he could. <br/>\nAnd jelly beans.  And ice cream.  We try to limit how many sweets we have<br/>\nin the house but if he finds them and asks for them, he gets them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have handled things this way.  From the moment our son put food in his<br/>\nmouth he has been allowed to choose what he does and doesn&#39;t eat.  We have<br/>\nNEVER made him take a bite of something for any reason.  Okay, maybe I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten frustrated a few times and tried to make him take a bite but it<br/>\ndidn&#39;t work.  My goal as his parent is that he develops a healthy<br/>\nrelationship with food, not that he learns to eat how I teach him but that<br/>\nhe is able to eat in a healthy manner, to recognize healthy choices and<br/>\nunhealthy choices, and him having control over his food is far more<br/>\nimportant than him taking a bite of vegetables or fruit every few weeks. <br/>\nSo I don&#39;t bother.  Nutrition intake over one day is so unimportant to me<br/>\ncompared to looking at the big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe food pickiness is a stage and it will end.  In the meantime, you can<br/>\ngive a multivitamin.  You can buy enriched bread.  You can keep offering<br/>\nhealthy fruits and veggies knowing that he WILL eat them at some point. <br/>\nThese things will help support his brain and body development while<br/>\nallowing him to maintain independence and you to support his freedom and<br/>\nempowerment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I do with my son is have him COOK with me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>\nhaving a 3 year old in the kitchen but it&#39;s also joyous.  We made<br/>\nvegetable soup a few weeks ago and he had so much fun, then sat down and<br/>\nate 1.5 bowls of veggie soup that included green beans, corn, kale and all<br/>\nkinds of VEGETABLES.  He has a lot of motivation to eat healthy foods that<br/>\nhe&#39;s helped make.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; I really understand what you&#39;re saying here and feel in alignment with<br/>\n&gt; this<br/>\n&gt; statement on many levels.  What is challenging for us with this is that we<br/>\n&gt; spend time discussing this with our son, telling him why we feel it<br/>\n&gt; important to eat certain foods to support the body and brain, and he<br/>\n&gt; listens, and then chooses to eat other less healthy things very<br/>\n&gt; frequently.   We occasionally point out what these choices mean to him,<br/>\n&gt; ensuring we are giving him space and not nagging him, and he seems to not<br/>\n&gt; care or not to understand.

And I<br/>\nhave learned, boy have I learned and I am still learning. That is why I am<br/>\nstill a member of this list after about 9 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing to this list with the intention of &#39;proving me being right&#39; is not<br/>\nthe most helpful way for anyone to come to embracing the ideas of<br/>\nunschooling as in - I&#39;ll trust my child to be able to learn what they need<br/>\nto make their way into the world&#39; much less into radical unschooling which<br/>\nbasically says &quot;I trust my child to know - and learn - what is right for<br/>\nthem - be it knowledge, skills, everyday functions like food intake, sleep,<br/>\nactvities, social skills and interactions and so many more - and the most<br/>\nimportant thing in this is to hold our relationship sacred.&quot;  Really - after<br/>\nall these years the most fundamental thing I learned about unschooling is<br/>\nthe sacredness of the relatonships we as parents can have with our children<br/>\nand how we endanger this &#39;holy grail&#39; every time when we contemplate<br/>\n&#39;mainstream&#39; parenting endeavours to control behaviour or ensure seeming<br/>\nsafety.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you owners and moderators of this list to look after the intentions of<br/>\nradical unschooling while not trying to change society per se but to just<br/>\nprovide examples of how to find that sacred place of connecting withing and<br/>\nwith our children to hold each other in highest regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlissings<br/>\nUlrike<br/>\nFrom Namibia - somewhere in Africa<br/>\nPS - I am a little bit emotional at this point as we had a most agreeable<br/>\nmothersday feast with lots of family today and my father told my nearly 18<br/>\nyear old son to behave at the dinner table. My father is nearly 92. And we<br/>\n(my brothers and I) were told all the good manners, of course. (loopsided<br/>\ngrin) I was so glad that A. was willing to join us at all. He is not a<br/>\n&#39;crowd person&#39; at  all. And he (A) took the &#39;correction&#39; with great dignity.<br/>\nHe took down his &#39;offending legs&#39;, sat up straight (my he is a seating<br/>\ngiant!), head back, nose high and said, kind of under his breath &#39;We are<br/>\nhighly offended.&#39; (and took another bite at his chicken drumstick) Was he<br/>\nindicating the being offended by his grandparents words or was he playing<br/>\nthe offense of the old man? I don&#39;t know yet. Maybe I never will. But A. did<br/>\nnot get up and leave the table right then and there in a huff. And just<br/>\nminutes after this incident my granddaughter was told by her other<br/>\ngrandmother to also &#39;behave&#39;. And she ignored this rebuke royally. Good for<br/>\nher. Actually the whole thing kind of deteriorated from there even though<br/>\nnobody was aware. The other granddaughter then spilled all of her jello onto<br/>\nthe white table cloth. We spooned it back into her bowl and she finished it<br/>\nwith gusto also using her hands (Did you know that you can eat jello with<br/>\nyour hands? :). AND nobody said a word! Actually I am very, VERY happy to<br/>\nhave my parents living near us since February this year. We have had Easter<br/>\nand Mother&#39;s Day as an extended family feast together already. Neither my<br/>\nparents nor the other &#39;grandparents&#39; or even my daughter and her boyfriend<br/>\n(father of the two sweetnesses) are into &#39;unschooling&#39; even though they love<br/>\nthe children and grandchildren in their own way. So I do my &#39;unschooling&#39; in<br/>\na sneaky and behind the scenes way to defuse situations. What is the saying,<br/>\n&quot;Please pass the bean dish.!&quot; Thank you for &#39;listening&#39;.

That&#39;s natural  <br/>\nto human psychology. A parent&#39;s (or spouse&#39;s or social worker&#39;s or  <br/>\nminister&#39;s) loving intent can&#39;t change psychology.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone doesn&#39;t want to damage their relationship with their child  <br/>\n-- *especially* if someone decides to protect their child from a  <br/>\npotential interest -- it&#39;s important to know how the protection feels  <br/>\nto the child! It&#39;s important to know that a parent&#39;s good intentions  <br/>\nwon&#39;t counteract actions that have the opposite feel to the child.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s good to know that protection from something interesting  <br/>\n(especially if it&#39;s everywhere in society) will chip away at a child&#39;s  <br/>\ntrust in his parent. It&#39;s good to know why a child will then decide  <br/>\nthe parent won&#39;t help them explore so, if the drive to explore is  <br/>\ngreat enough, they&#39;ll do it on their own or find someone who will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone decides to limit *and* they understand how it feels from  <br/>\ntheir child&#39;s point of view, they might be able to come up with better  <br/>\nthan conventional approaches. They&#39;ll be able to see the pitfalls and  <br/>\nperhaps find a way to get around them or at least partially fill them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think adults need to provide some guidance,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Please show me where anyone has said don&#39;t provide guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents provide lots of guidance. It doesn&#39;t look like  <br/>\nconventional parental guidance so I think it gets dismissed as no  <br/>\nguidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadical unschooling guidance looks similar to the guidance given to a  <br/>\nfriend or spouse who might want to explore an area you&#39;re familar  <br/>\nwith. (But not similar on all points!) It&#39;s more like the guidance  <br/>\nyou&#39;d give to someone you trust to explore however they want with no  <br/>\npressure to do it your way. Radical unschoolers support their kids  <br/>\nexploration and help them find safe and respectful ways to explore.  <br/>\nParents provide a safe and respectful environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, if a mom was into natural foods, she would provide  <br/>\nmeals and snacks that she felt were &quot;good&quot;.

One of the common confusions that come out on lists is that all the other wonderful, exciting things that each family is doing can get tied up in the idea of &quot;unschooling&quot; - and in a way, that makes sense, if you&#39;re trying to move away from dividing the world up into subjects! At the same time, unschooling is really the Only thing we all have in common, here, and that&#39;s a big part of why the focus of this list is kept narrow. Its Not an alternative lifestyle list because that&#39;s disenfranchising to unschoolers who aren&#39;t interested in being &quot;alternative&quot; beyond unschooling itself. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;If you really want to change things, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To keep the focus on unschooling, this list isn&#39;t about changing &quot;things&quot; so much as changing Ourselves. Part of that has to do with the diversity of unschoolers - we don&#39;t all want to change the same things about the world! but a bigger part is that a basic premise of unschooling is children don&#39;t need to be changed, that change is inherent in childhood. Unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;raising&quot; children! Its about valuing who they are and what they love right now, even when who they are and what they love seems to conflict with who *we* are and what we love. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;don&#39;t be quite so sure of your own thinking, I say.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t agree more! Its especially important to question each and every idea about what it means to respect children, because most of those ideas revolve around the assumption that children need guides. Unschooling questions that in a biiiiig way. What if they don&#39;t need, guides? What if they need partners, friends and allies? What does that mean? What does it look like? <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what it &quot;means&quot; is looking for more ways for us, parents, to change to meet the specific needs of our specific kids. That&#39;s hard. I like me ;) I tend to resist changing my habits and expectations. And yet, some of my habits and expectations get in the way of my relationship with my kids. I Want to keep improving my relationship with my kids! I Want to be my best self, kinder, more thoughtful, more generous to everyone, including myself. And for that I&#39;ll challenge myself, over and over, to change, to question, to be skeptical of what I think I know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying unschooling is about giving up what you&#39;re passionate about for the sake of your kids - I don&#39;t mean to give that impression when I say &quot;change yourself&quot;. It is about expanding your own world, though, of going as much beyond your comfort zone as you can manage, in support of someone you love with all your heart. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262940054,"authorName":"Stephanie Tavera","from":"Stephanie Tavera &lt;lilmamibella@...&gt;","profile":"earthangel21_2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] thank you & goodbye","postDate":"1273240902","msgId":43879,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHoybzExZmRkNTEwMTAwNTA3MDcwMXQxNjYyNTM0YW00Y2ZiOTdmNjU2ZDQwNjFmQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhydmoybCtxZWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhydmoybCtxZWk4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43878,"nextInTopic":43882,"prevInTime":43878,"nextInTime":43880,"topicId":43878,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I hate to see you leave Liz!
