My husband and I would","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-289204608\">Tamara,<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have been there and just recently were able to remember what spending money is. It is a very hard and worrisome situation. My husband and I would make a list of things that were needed and things that were wanted for ourselves and for our son and daughter. Our son is 4 yrs old but he does understand that you need money to get things. We helped our daughter with her list and told her that it was her choice to get wants over needs and she learned that needs came first and if there was money left from that it went to wants or was saved up over a period of time to get the want item(s). We helped our son decide by explaining to him that if he needed new shoes and wanted something that if he got the fun thing he sometimes wouldn&#39;t have enough to get the need thing. I got extra check registers from the bank and set one up for each of the kids so they could keep track and they each have their own piggy bank. It has taken some time but they did learn to make<br/>\n good choices. It took a few times of mommy and daddy getting kiddo needs instead so that they would have what they needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did divide the money equally between the 4 of us. The kids have learned fiscal responsibility. Now even when we go to the store for a regular grocery shopping or to get things for the garden or art supplies or whatever. They know we have to look carefully at prices and determine things that have to be bought before we get things that we simply just want. We are still dividing up the left over money and keeping the amounts that we all have the same as when we were on a very tight budget. We did ours weekly so the kids are getting $10 per week. Right now most of it is going into their own banks because there are some big ticket items that they would like. We are covering their needs as part of our budget since there really are so many things. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am proud of them both for learning frugality (not penny pinch misers) and fiscal responsibility. This weekend my son should have enough for his spiderman bike and new helmet. My daughter has decided that she wants a small sewing machine and should be able to get that this weekend as well. Since they have had to save for their wants we have also noticed that they take better care of their things. We weren&#39;t at first but we learned quickly that we needed to be honest with them about finances. It is very hard for children at first to understand why we can&#39;t just go out and buy everything we see. We didn&#39;t do it in a OMG we are so broke kind of way. We simply sat down and said we have X amount of dollars and X amount of expenses. These expenses need to be covered before we can do anything else. So there were some weeks where spending money was not available. But it was ok because the expenses were covered and we were able to at least relax and know that<br/>\n all was well even if there wasn&#39;t any extra.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nTammy Curry, Director of Chaos<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/\">http://tammycurry.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/\">http://crazy-homeschool-adventures.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myspace.com/mamabeart00\">http://myspace.com/mamabeart00</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: griesellists &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:griesellists@...\">griesellists@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, March 12, 2009 12:17:53 AM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Budgets and allowance<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re on a very tight budget, and I&#39;m finding myself needing to elicit the assistance of my children in making sure that ends meet.
