He wants to play on the computer all day and I am allowing this, although my husband is terrified that he will delete something important.  And this is a real risk!  He&#39;s a quick clicker and when I leave the room for half a minute to pee or something, I come back and he has 25 windows up, has connected to the internet, etc.  He did manage to open one of my word documents and &quot;type letters&quot; in front of it...tho there was no harm done.  DH and I know very little about computers, so I was hoping one of you might could<br/>\n tell me how we can lock him out of our files.  I have been trying to teach him to only play his own games or notepad or paint, but you know he wants to click on everything to &quot;see what dis do.&quot;  I found some freeware programs that seemed to me to just lock the whole computer and make the keyboard make funny sounds when they bang on it...I don&#39;t want that...Will would be taking the computer apart &quot;tryin to fix it,&quot; and I don&#39;t want to lock him out of the computer (tho dh does)!
