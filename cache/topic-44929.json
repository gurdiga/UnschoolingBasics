The History Channel and the Science (Nat Geo?) Channel are (from your post) apparently more important/have more value than, say, Cartoon Network or TMC. LOTS of learning can come from cartoons, old movies, and Food Network.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTake of your school colored glasses and try to see ALL learning as equal.
