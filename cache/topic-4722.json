I believe this is how my kids (now 10 and 12)<br/>\nlearned to read, but I didn&#39;t read to them to teach them to read.  I just<br/>\nread to them because it was something fun to do together.  With my daughter,<br/>\nI guess I showed her words every now and then, if it was something she<br/>\nreally liked.  For example, she loves animals, so I would show her the word<br/>\n&quot;dog&quot; &#39;cause I think seeing a word you really like to hear written down is<br/>\nso cool.  But if you read to your sweet children in the hopes they will<br/>\nlearn to read, then it won&#39;t work.  I promise they will pick up on the fact<br/>\nthat you find them not-quite-good-enough.<br/>\n     I guess, to me, unschooling is looking for the things in my life and in<br/>\nthe world in general, find the things that feel joyful, and offer that to my<br/>\nchildren.  Just seeing what they are interested in and helping them do<br/>\nwhatever it is will accomplish my overall goal for them:  enjoy their life.<br/>\nMy goal isn&#39;t &quot;be able to read,&quot; or &quot; learn to do this type of math<br/>\nproblem.&quot;  To me those are tools that they may need one day to enjoy life.<br/>\nBut why get the tool if you don&#39;t need it yet?<br/>\n    Instead of trying to teach my kids anything, I just want them to look at<br/>\nlife and think, &quot;Wow, there is so much out there.  What do I feel like doing<br/>\ntoday!&quot;   I also think it is important to help my kids do whatever it is<br/>\nthey feel like doing, rather than comparing them to other kids.  If I think,<br/>\noh, by this age, most kids are doing multiplication tables, and my kids<br/>\naren&#39;t...well that falls under competitve parenting, which is using your<br/>\nkids to feel better about yourself.  Also, competitive parenting is<br/>\nthinking, &quot;to be a &#39;good parent&#39; I have to, or my kids have to, &lt;fill in the<br/>\nblank&gt;.  Unschooling for me has been trying to ignore those expectations.<br/>\n    I&#39;ve ssen others say that to unschool, you can think of yourself as a<br/>\ntour guide for your kids.  I like that comparison.  Life is so cool--just<br/>\nrelax and enjoy being with your kids and everything else will fall in line.<br/>\nDeirdre</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165113240,"authorName":"dinalauzon","from":"&quot;dinalauzon&quot; &lt;dlauzon32@...&gt;","profile":"dinalauzon","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Want to know more about unschooling","postDate":"1106152172","msgId":4725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNzbTF0Yyt1Z2k5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNza2F0bittYnA5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4724,"nextInTopic":4726,"prevInTime":4724,"nextInTime":4726,"topicId":4722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am currently reading John Holt s book Learning All the Time .

One of the<br/>\nadvantages of Unschooling is you get to keep this authentic child in your<br/>\nlife instead of overlaying a bunch of stuff and irrelevant information on<br/>\ntop of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best suggestion I have for you is to put an immediate moratorium on<br/>\n*any* lessons, *any* curriculum, any thoughts of you &quot;making it&quot; fun, and<br/>\nspend the next few weeks actually having genuine fun and allowing him (and<br/>\nyour younger one) to play and show you the stuff he is interested in.<br/>\nRespond to requests for help or information. Be a driver to interesting<br/>\nplaces. He will not &quot;fall behind&quot;, a concept that is anathema to Unschooling<br/>\nwith joy, in a few weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, spend as much time as you have available (freed from all<br/>\nthat lesson planning and review) reading this list and its archives, reading<br/>\nat www.sandradodd.com/unschooling , www.unschoolinginfo.com and<br/>\nwww.unschooling.com , reading John Holt, and observing your child learning<br/>\nfrom his own explorations to give you courage and reassurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;My youngest is 3 and we will be <br/>\nsoon starting preschool learning with him not that everyday isn&#39;t <br/>\nlearning but more time for just him one on one.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won&#39;t need to bother with him &quot;starting&quot; anything if you decide to<br/>\nUnschool. Just let him continue to play with his myriad interests and watch<br/>\nthem morph and grow over time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI spend one on one time with my loved ones because I enjoy their company and<br/>\nI believe they want my attention, not because they have some learning lack I<br/>\nhave to address.
