I think its more of the<br/>\nissue of opening communication with our children at an early age and<br/>\nbuilding trust (in each other) so that they don&#39;t feel that they have to<br/>\nsneak around when they get older. If the communication had been open at a<br/>\nyoung age she and her parents would have been able to have a reasonable and respectful discussion about dating and she probably would have come to the conclusion on her own about whether she was ready to date ot not. I know that when I was 13 or 14 they had school dances and groups going to movies and such. Its hard to be part of that when you&#39;re &quot;not allowed&quot; to be.
