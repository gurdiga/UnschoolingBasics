I know an organic farming, homeschooling family and often think what a wonderful life for the kids that is -- lots of interesting help and visitors, adults engaged in real  (and interesting to kids too -- not typing at a computer) work, lots of space to explore and play outside.  But I taught before I had kids, not a world I could bring them into or want to at this point, though I might have then:-)  I don&#39;t really know how to do this in our age-segregated culture.

I will have to take some time to digest this and ponder your perspectives.  I don&#39;t have the luxury of being home with the children full-time therefore finding time for all we need  and want to do as a family  is not always easy. That being the case there are times when I get impatient with the children (and myself) when things seem &#39;out of control&#39; (for example when we need to be somewhere and things aren&#39;t coming together smoothly) . I don&#39;t want to feel impatient with them but as someone mentioned, perhaps a different way of looking parenting would be helpful.  It definitely changes my perspective if I imagine this could (on any day) be my last day with them....  In some ways I am finding your responses  ironic because I&#39;d always thought of myself as very liberal, lenient , free parent. I am one of the few <br/>\nunschoolers I know in my area.  I had concerns that I was not doing enough to maintain parental control of my children (comparing myself of course with those families I come into contact with regularly in the local homeschooling community). I did recently read the book on the Yahoo site reading list  (The Unprocessed Child) which I thoroughly enjoyed and am passing along to a homeschooling friend who is thinking of unschooling.  Anyhow thanks to all for your input.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:TheLerews@...\">TheLerews@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe intention is not to be cruel but as a different approach to <br/>\nhelping them see the<br/>\nimportance of getting ourselves ready to go out in more functional way <br/>\nfor<br/>\neverybody- and precisely because nagging them over and over each and <br/>\nevery time<br/>\nwe went out of the house was not effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nTo a small child, *intent* doesn&#39;t enter ino it though.

I know that if I  find myself in a situation where I am unprepared and am uncomfortable as a result ( be that discomfort emotional or physical) it helps me to learn that the next time I want to be better prepared. Children are certainly capable of the same learning experiences. I am referring to a child who is old enough to understand the requests being made of him in advance of putting him a certain situation (e.g., please select a toy because it is almost time to go to baby&#39;s doctor appt) The intention is not to be cruel but as a different approach to helping them see the importance of  getting ourselves ready to go out in more functional way for everybody- and precisely because nagging them over and over  each and every time we went out of the house was not effective. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe I need to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>reprioritize - most often by shifting my kids&#39; needs to connect with <br/>\nme to a higher level of importance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all have responsibilities to other people besides our children.  A parent might feel their children&#39;s needs  should always take priority and in a perfect world or in a vaccuum this would be the case. There are times when even within a family one child&#39;s (sickness for example) needs might necessarily  take priority over another child&#39;s needs (needing help with a video game). When mommy is helping her sick child throw-up the video game will have to wait .  That is life.   Sometimes the priority is being someplace and being there on time.  If I have one sick  infant  in need of a doctor&#39;s attention, and two other children over the age of 7 who are feeling well and are capable of understanding that &quot; baby needs to go to the doctor. We need to leave the house in 30 minutes to bring the baby to the doctor so please choose the toy you would like to bring along if any.  This is not an unrealistic expectation, and there is no misunderstanding the request.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;That&#39;s punishment. Do it my way or be unhappy - your fault, no <br/>\n </span></blockquote>arguments, I *told* you to get ready and even how. Ouch. <br/>\nPunishment or consequence?  The reality is that there are always consequences (be they positive or negative) to our actions.   If a child is kindly reminded that the family is going to an appointment and asked if they would like to take along a toy- if that child says &quot;yes&quot; and mother says- &quot;ok we will be leaving soon , please go ahead and select a toy so we can leave the house&quot;- child says &quot;ok&quot;- then proceeds to get involved in another activity and forgets to choose a toy  (mind you, this is not a single episode, occurs repeatedly), then another way of learning is needed. Unfortunately leaving toys packed in the car does not do the tricks.  Tried and failed.  There comes a time when I feel my children do need to understand and respect what the needs are of others in the family (and in their world).   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, TheLerews@... wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;I still need to remind them (no matter how early we start the <br/>\n&gt;process of &#39;getting ready&#39; ) to make sure they get socks and shoes <br/>\n&gt;on, get whatever toys they are bringing along , etc., SEVERAL <br/>\n&gt;times. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I find I&#39;m repeating myself, I take that as a cue that something <br/>\nisn&#39;t working.

I was talking <br/>\nwith a<br/>\nfriend about this today and she said, &quot;That&#39;s my problem -- being a <br/>\ndoormat and<br/>\nthen feeling put-upon and getting angry -- but how do you do that?&quot;  <br/>\nSince I&#39;m<br/>\nstill trying to figure this one out myself, I&#39;m hoping you all have <br/>\nsome<br/>\nanswers!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, there&#39;s not a *solution*---it&#39;s more of a paradigm shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s understanding that these little people NEED us so damned much! I <br/>\nmean: really, really NEED us!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe *all* (even my heroes, Deb and Rue) sometimes feel put-upon and get <br/>\nangry. But it&#39;s not THAT we feel that way---it&#39;s how we choose to <br/>\nhandle it when it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore unschooling, I would fuss and TELL them how put out I was---or <br/>\nask them to do it themselves, damn it! Then after starting to <br/>\nincorporate the ideas I read from unschoolers, I would still grind my <br/>\nteeth and glare. &lt;g&gt; Now, years later, I may still feel deep down <br/>\nsomewhere as if they *could* do it themselves (they *are* a lot older, <br/>\nafter all! &lt;g&gt;). Instead I smile and happily do it, knowing that it <br/>\n*could* be the last time I get to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, it&#39;s about changing the mind-set---changing the way YOU feel <br/>\nabout the same thing/situation. And KNOW that they won&#39;t be little <br/>\nforever. They won&#39;t be around forever: children grow up and move out. <br/>\nUnfortunately, some die very young. There are no guarantees!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would you treat them if this were the last day you had together? <br/>\nWould you be GLAD to be a doormat? Would even SEE yourself as a <br/>\ndoormat? Or as a mom who adores them and can&#39;t get enough of them and <br/>\ncan&#39;t DO enough for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t always work---some days you *will* feel worn out and unable to <br/>\ndo *one more thing* for them. But if that *were* the last thing you <br/>\n*could* do---wouldn&#39;t you? And it gets easier: the more you practice <br/>\ngentle, mindful parenting, the easier it gets---plus: they get older <br/>\nevery single minute!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a specific scenario, here&#39;s one, although I&#39;m really <br/>\nlooking for<br/>\nbroader thoughts rather than help on this incident:<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to get out the door early to a commitment (substitute teaching <br/>\nSunday<br/>\nSchool) and 4yo wants a toy.  Find the toy.  Wants a snack.  Fix the <br/>\nsnack.<br/>\nWants something else, I no longer remember what, find it.  Get to the <br/>\ncar, snack<br/>\nfalls, wants it washed off -- but by now we&#39;re 10 minutes *late* as I <br/>\ndiscover<br/>\ncar clock is later than kitchen clock.  Rest of the family had gone <br/>\nearlier, so<br/>\nI was on my own.  This time I said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it fell in the dirt, <br/>\nand you<br/>\nreally wanted to eat it now.  I really don&#39;t have time to wash it now <br/>\nbecause<br/>\nwe&#39;re already late and people at church are depending on me and <br/>\nwondering where<br/>\nwe are.  We can take it in to the water fountain and wash it at <br/>\nchurch.&quot;  But<br/>\nreally, I think I did too many things before we left.  I really did <br/>\nhave a time<br/>\ncommitment, but I kept thinking, &quot;It will be much faster to find the <br/>\ntoy than to<br/>\ntry to take an upset child...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=--=<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it was just an example, but let&#39;s use it:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a big part of it is seeing that NONE of that was *his* fault! <br/>\nYES, if you were childless, you could get out the door quickly and <br/>\neasily. You&#39;re not! You need to prepare ahead of time. You&#39;re a <br/>\nparent---and parents run on &quot;kid time&quot; not adult time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan&#39;t fix what&#39;s already passed, but in this instance: Maybe he&#39;s too <br/>\nyoung for you to make outside commitments, like subbing at Sunday <br/>\nschool. And if you *do* have places to go (on time), you may need to <br/>\neither realize you&#39;ll be late OR---better: get up earlier! Have all <br/>\nthose things in order and already in the car or in a bag to grab <br/>\n(snack, toys, shoes, coats) as you walk out the door. Be proactive! If <br/>\nyou *know* he&#39;ll need these things, get them ready the night before or <br/>\nbefore he wakes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the clock thing: that was *really* not his fault! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably WAS a lot faster to find the toy---and I&#39;m sure he <br/>\nappreciated your searching for it! As well as your explanantion of why <br/>\nyou needed to go. But again---that was not *his* problem! &lt;G&gt; HE didn&#39;t <br/>\nmake that commitment! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI HATE to be late, so if I am, there was something really wrong. I get <br/>\nup extra early and try to pack and organize things ahead of time. I <br/>\nlike to be able to just walk aout the door. Cameron (19) is like that <br/>\nnow: years of modelling! &lt;g&gt; Duncan (11 next week) is getting that <br/>\nway---especially with trips, but I still do most of his packing and <br/>\norganizing. I also remind him of things that I know he&#39;d miss having <br/>\nalong(stuffed animal, game, pillow).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou already know what went wrong *last* time, so you can take steps to <br/>\navoid *those* things next time. There will still be new things that <br/>\ncome up &lt;g&gt;, but you can add those things as you learn them to make it <br/>\nbetter and better.

The older children can do some things for themselves (e.g., getting the last minute cup of juice as we race out the door) , or even helping a younger sib get a last minute cup of juice so mommy can take care of the infant.  I find it works well if we make it a team effort to get out the door on time and peacefully. The old option in our famliy (which did not work so well) was mommy racing around trying to get everyone else ready and out the door (including herself)  without blowing a fuse or resorting to screeching at the children ( which I would feel terribly guilty about once we were in the car on our way). (It seemed no matter how early we got up there was always a last minute frantic race to get out the door)  . My children (as do most I suspect) tend to  get themselves immersed in whatever game they are playing at the moment and  &#39;forget&#39; that we<br/>\n need to leave by a certain time. I still need to remind them (no matter how early we start the process of &#39;getting ready&#39; ) to make sure they get socks and shoes on, get whatever toys they are bringing along , etc., SEVERAL times.   :-)   I do try to teach my children (when they are old enough to understand of course)  that  when we make certain types of commitments ( a doctor appointment for example) that it is important to arrive on time out of respect for the doctor&#39;s time and also for the patients who have appointments following ours.  I try to show them that, when you  are told you have an hour before the family needs to leave  for an appointment, you need to think about making sure you are dressed, fed, and have used the toilet. Oh, and that you gathered up a book or toy if you want to take it along.  Naturally I help as needed with these tasks but as my children become older they can take more responsibility for some of these things.  I don&#39;t think it sends a good message t<br/>\no <br/>\nmy children if I allow them to run back into the house for forgotten toys or a last minute drink at the expense of the doctor (or whoever is waiting on our arrival). For us its a better lesson to let the child go without the toy for the hour we are at the doctor appt that day.Perhaps  then the  next time a similar situation arises and mommy says an hour in advance&#39; ok guys, be sure you get a toy ready, its close to time to leave&#39;  the child will remember (and I will remind him gently) being unhappy because he forgot a toy and be certain to have it ready this time around.   Its not that I think my child&#39;s needs are less important than the doctor&#39;s time but we have to function in a society where at times appointments must be made and kept.  And I do want my children to be respectful of others&#39; time and needs, as well as their own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>\nFrom: Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Feb 20, 2007, at 4:52 PM, Katharine Wise wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; If you want a specific scenario, here&#39;s one, although I&#39;m really <br/>\n&gt; looking for broader thoughts rather than help on this incident:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Trying to get out the door early to a commitment (substitute <br/>\n&gt; teaching Sunday School) and 4yo wants a toy.

I really did have a time commitment, but I kept thinking, &quot;It will be much faster to find the toy than to try to take an upset child...&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nNo need to miss a message.
