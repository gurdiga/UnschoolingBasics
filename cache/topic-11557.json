Like my aunt says, ask him &quot;what does that look like?&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I&#39;m saying is instead of trying to talk him out of his concern, enlist  <br/>\nhis help.  I know you feel like this is contrary, but people tend to defend  <br/>\ntheir positions even when they know they might be wrong.  He is stuck in  handw<br/>\nriting and math.  How can you help him out of &quot;stuck&quot;?  He can&#39;t  hear the <br/>\ntruth while he is stuck.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat&#39;s why I believe in validating.  By asking him gently what would  he <br/>\nideally like to see happen in these areas, you are taking him  seriously.  Usually <br/>\nonce a person feels heard, they no longer need to  defend and then they are <br/>\nwilling to negotiate and sometimes drop it  altogether.  He wants to be a part <br/>\nof your daughter&#39;s world and he wants  his concerns to be heard....it&#39;s only <br/>\nnatural.  How does he think she  should learn these things and can you then <br/>\nfind a good compromise?<br/>\n <br/>\nYou say you are almost there, that is great!!  I think a little more  <br/>\npatience and giving him some understanding will go a long way.....maybe not  <br/>\nimmediately....but it will happen.<br/>\n <br/>\nAn example.  My husband is concerned that our son doesn&#39;t read.   He wants me <br/>\nto read to him every night and I constantly explained  that Nick doesn&#39;t <br/>\nenjoy it.  Finally one day I asked him to do  it, I am usually too tired anyway.  <br/>\nPerhaps Nick would enjoy doing that  with his father more.  I thought two <br/>\nthings might happen, either they would  both love it and it would be a terrific <br/>\nthing for them both or my husband would  see for himself that Nick didn&#39;t enjoy <br/>\nit and drop it.  Well, my husband  only read to him for two or three nights, <br/>\nso I assume they didn&#39;t enjoy  it.  Nothing was ever said and my husband rarely <br/>\nbrings it up any  more.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt might sound manipulative, but it is really more about getting  out of a <br/>\ndefensive position and getting the energy flowing again.    When I am hearing <br/>\nmyself saying &quot;but, but, but.....&quot; I know we are in  &quot;stuck&quot;.  Then it is time <br/>\nto start validating the other person and really  listening to their concerns <br/>\nwith an open heart.<br/>\n <br/>\nJust my two cents....this is just something I&#39;m learning at the moment with  <br/>\nmy own husband!<br/>\n <br/>\nLeslie in SC<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: husbands and unschooling","postDate":"1144846173","msgId":11729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODJDNDZBRTg5QTFBMi0xRjk0LTRFM0BtYmxrLXIzMi5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ1ZTJkOWRhMDYwNDEyMDUyMWs1ZWY4MTQ3OHJkYWNiNWMxNjgzZDhjMTgxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDJlZS41NjY5YjdmLjMxNmQ1OTQ4QGFvbC5jb20+IDw0NWUyZDlkYTA2MDQxMjA1MjFrNWVmODE0NzhyZGFjYjVjMTY4M2Q4YzE4MUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":11726,"nextInTopic":11734,"prevInTime":11728,"nextInTime":11730,"topicId":11557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Now to be completely honest, when he told me that I <br/>\nbusted<br/>\nout laughing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I would have too! &lt;g.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would respond that, with unschooling, a child will not be afraid to <br/>\nlearn *anything* that she&#39;s interested in at any time. SO...if we were <br/>\nto lose technology (My father says  that when the apocalypse comes, <br/>\nwe&#39;ll all need to know how to ring a chicken&#39;s neck. Not exactly true, <br/>\nbut I get the gist.), she would THEN learn how to write legibly. And <br/>\nprobably very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk him *this*: when did he learn to use a computer? Well, I could be <br/>\naging myself here! &lt;bwg&gt; Some of you learned in school! We didn&#39;t have <br/>\ncomputers when I was in school. They didn&#39;t show up until after my <br/>\nfirst child was born---and boy, were they expensive!! But anyway. I DID <br/>\nlearn how to use one. Fairly well. My children have caught on more <br/>\nquickly and are less afraid of the machins than I am. I&#39;m always afraid <br/>\nI will break something! &lt;g&gt; But I *have* learned how to use one. ALL of <br/>\nus here have. Because we wanted to. Because we had a use for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with handwriting. When it&#39;s a tool she needs, she wil learn it. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not important to her *now*.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as math is concerned, it&#39;s the blanket statement that everyone<br/>\nuses......&quot;She needs it&quot;.

When you are doing math---any <br/>\nmath---in your head, start doing it out loud---do the figurin&#39; where <br/>\nshe can hear it. NOT to &quot;teach&quot; her something---just to show her your <br/>\nmethod. Mine and my husband&#39;s are very different. He thinks in numbers. <br/>\nI think in words &/or pictures. So my boys see different ways to do the <br/>\nsame thing. Duncan&#39;s a numbers guy. Cameron is pictures. It helps them <br/>\nrealize that there&#39;s more than one way and that not only one way works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso. If she needs it, she will find it narurally. If she doesn&#39;t find <br/>\nit, she won&#39;t need it! Math is the ultimate unschooling example. It&#39;s <br/>\nout there. We use it every day. Because it&#39;s out there. Because we use <br/>\nit. Circular logic maybe, but it&#39;s true! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just so frustrating, because we&#39;re almost there.

The kids in the top 10 percent are bored silly and the kids on the bottom fall out of the system completely. I�m a bottom 10 percenter myself. I stopped going to class in 8th grade because I was constantly told that I would<br/>\nbe a failure if I couldn�t do better than a C-minus average. I eventually dropped out and left home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then I have taught myself typography, programming, SGML, marketing, cooking, candle making, and screenwriting (Honorable Mention, Best of The West Film Festival, 1999, �Life�). I pursued those endeavors because they interested me. It is certain that no school would have taught me those disparate subjects; even programming wasn�t available to me because of my infinite deficiencies in mathematics. Interestingly, I became a programmer without any of the prerequisite math that educators demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 2003 I left a programming job to buy a modest coffee shop in Corvallis�before that day I had never been in a coffee shop, worked in food service, or owned a business. I set about teaching myself restaurant management, bookkeeping, plumbing, business management, and a slew of other things. I have recently<br/>\nexpanded that caf� into a popular and beloved eatery that contributes to downtown Corvallis� character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcademically speaking, I am an utter failure; and yet that fact has proven to be completely irrelevant in my life.

Do any of<br/>\nyou have dads that aren&#39;t quite &quot;there&quot; yet?  There are some days<br/>\nthat John is ok with all of it and then some when he wants to take my<br/>\nhead off.  And it&#39;s always the same old complaints.  Handwriting and<br/>\nmath.  I&#39;ve forwarded emails, left articles laying around, borrowed<br/>\nbooks (and kept them too long...sorry Dawn) for him to read, but he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even read one word.  I&#39;d love to get him to a conference, but<br/>\nthere&#39;s none around here and it&#39;s tough to get time off to go out of<br/>\ntown let alone out of state.  I&#39;m open to any and all suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like we&#39;re at an impasse.  How about any dads out there that are<br/>\n&quot;there&quot;?  Any suggestions.  He&#39;s fine with everything else:  Bedtimes, food,<br/>\ntv, video games, etc.  It&#39;s just these two subjects.  I have noticed that<br/>\nquite a number of people have the issue with math, but the handwriting<br/>\nthing?  My dd (11) can print quite well.  Her cursive is awful, but yet so<br/>\nis her father&#39;s - go figure.  Anyway...like I said before I&#39;m open to any<br/>\nand all suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77669557,"authorName":"gailbrocop@aol.com","from":"gailbrocop@...","profile":"gailbrocop","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] husbands and unschooling","postDate":"1144764170","msgId":11606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxOS4xNTZhYzhlNC4zMTZkMTEwYUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11602,"nextInTopic":11608,"prevInTime":11605,"nextInTime":11607,"topicId":11557,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m  wondering:  has anyone had a husband who was gung-ho about radical unschooling?
