I&#39;ve been calling myself an unschooler for many years,<br/>\nbecause of the ultimate freedom and embracing of who they are beyond<br/>\ncompare, for the last several years out of school.

I would dare to say that TRUST is the <br/>\nmain thing.  If we trust are children to learn what they need, when <br/>\nthey need it, than we should trust them in all other areas of their <br/>\nlives.  We see ourselves as our children&#39;s partners, their friends, <br/>\ntheir teammates.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure there are lots others that can expand on that, I&#39;m not <br/>\nalways so good at putting my thoughts and emotions into words but I <br/>\nwould say there are definitely core beliefs in the unschooling <br/>\ncommunity that when you say you are an unschooler there is an <br/>\nassumption of certain shared philosophies. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone can be an unschooler, as far as different religious beliefs <br/>\netc.  but there may be some religions or cultures that don&#39;t lend <br/>\nthemselves to trusting their children but are more rule driven, <br/>\nlegalistic, etc  For instance, I consider myself a Christian but <br/>\ndon&#39;t allow myself (or try not to) be put in the Christian box.  <br/>\nThere are some &quot;universal&quot; Christian beliefs that I don&#39;t agree <br/>\nwith.  I jokingly say that I am a &quot;liberal Christian&quot;.  There are <br/>\nsome Christians that think our lifestyle is not all Christian-like <br/>\nbecause our children can debate with us, question us,  they can <br/>\nwatch R rated movies, they swear every so often etc,  I choose not <br/>\nto let that bother me.
