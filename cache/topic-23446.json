I  <br/>\nwas on my way to do something that couldn&#39;t wait--pee urgently,  <br/>\nmaybe?--so I didn&#39;t stop to pick them up right away. A few minutes  <br/>\nlater, as I came back into the room, I heard my 5-year-old saying,  <br/>\n&quot;If we pick these up, it will really help Mama, even though she&#39;s the  <br/>\none who spilled them.&quot; And there were my 5yo and my 2yo, picking up  <br/>\nthe Legos. They did a great job, too. I thanked them and said, &quot;I was  <br/>\nhaving a cranky day, and it really did help that you picked them up  <br/>\nfor me.&quot; And they hugged me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t pick up their toys every day. A lot of times my partner  <br/>\nand I do it. But moments like that--when they do it on their own, for  <br/>\ntheir own reasons, or to be kind to me--make the freedom we&#39;ve given  <br/>\nthem worth it. If kids are obedient all the time from fear of  <br/>\npunishment, how possible is it for them to offer an amazing gift like  <br/>\nthat? If I think they have a duty to pick up the toys all the time,  <br/>\nhow possible is it for me to receive a gift like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of questions now that I&#39;m an unschooler. Questions like,  <br/>\n&quot;How do they ever know what &#39;enough&#39; feels like if they&#39;re only ever  <br/>\nallowed four ounces of juice or an hour of TV at a time? If I&#39;m  <br/>\nimposing rules all the time, I never get to see that my kids can be  <br/>\nthoughtful, independent, creative, problem-solving, and sweet. If I  <br/>\nforce vegetables, I never get to see that sometimes my kids will eat  <br/>\nnothing but lima beans for dinner because the lima beans taste so  <br/>\ngood to them (and other days, nothing but bread or nothing but meat,  <br/>\nbut you take my point).<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Anon post--failing at unschooling","postDate":"1177635845","msgId":23450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTU2N0YxNUY1RTM5OS1EMzgtMjVCREBtYmxrLWQ0My5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGYwcmZnZCsyYTRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGYwcmZnZCsyYTRnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23449,"nextInTopic":23451,"prevInTime":23449,"nextInTime":23451,"topicId":23446,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I <br/>\nexpect them to stop watching TV and playing computer games when they <br/>\nstart to ignore other things that they have previously enjoyed doing. I <br/>\nexpect them to do their share of the household chores, since I&#39;m not a <br/>\nslave. I expect them to go to bed at an hour which will assure they get <br/>\nenough rest. And I certainly expect them to respect not only their <br/>\nelders, but all other people, simply by virtue of the fact that we all <br/>\nshare the same planet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect all that too, but mine do it out of respect and trust and <br/>\ngenerosity.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for all this, I &quot;have no right&quot; to call myself an unschooler. Well, <br/>\nif that&#39;s what being an unschooler means, then I don&#39;t want to! So <br/>\nthese days I call us &quot;self-directed learners&quot;, hoping that it conveys <br/>\nwhat we are about without the negative connotation that radical <br/>\nunschoolers have given the word &quot;unschoolers&quot;, to pretty much everyone <br/>\nwho is not one.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nGOOD.
