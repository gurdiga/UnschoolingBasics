If you give my 8 yr old a workbook or something from &quot;school&quot; he hates to write anything as he is Dyslexic they say, well to me he has eye tracking issues, but is fine. Well I got him a few pen pals from a Homeschool Yahoo Penpal group and he has NO PROBLEM writing to them. AND he has a map puzzle he goes and finds where they live on the map! A two fold purpose to write to penpals! If I asked him to write a paragraph in a workbook he would be having a fit. But to write to pen pals is not an issue, he enjoys that! He is sending them Valentines this weekend. His handwriting has improved and his cursive started on his own. He is doing it by himself and I dare say he writes better than I do at times!

Is he interested in<br/>\nthings? If you pulled him out of school, or you were school-at-homing,<br/>\nhe may not seem to be, because he&#39;s still deschooling, which can look<br/>\na lot like &quot;doing nothing all day&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, let him heal,<br/>\nand you can ask for specific things to help with deschooling on this<br/>\nlist and others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is happy and interested, that&#39;s a great start! If you aim your<br/>\ncompass for joy, help your son aim his the same, and let that be your<br/>\ntouchstone and way of being, that is really all you need. Learning<br/>\nWILL happen. You can&#39;t stop it from happening. It will NOT look like<br/>\nschool learning, and he more than likely won&#39;t be able to articulate<br/>\nwhat he&#39;s learning, but it *is* happening. Aim for joy. That is ALL<br/>\nyou need to be concerned with: what will help make my son happy in<br/>\nthis moment? Those moments after moments add up. You will soon forget<br/>\nschool even exists, and those doubting days will be no more - honest!<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers don&#39;t &quot;leave kids to their own interests&quot; - we are WITH<br/>\nkids in their own interests, as much as the kid desires or needs. It&#39;s<br/>\nabout connection, connection, connection - a concept I didn&#39;t *really*<br/>\nget &#39;til I&#39;d been unschooling for a little while.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to an unschooling conference! There are many, all around the US<br/>\nthis year. And outside the US, too! Let us know where you are, and we<br/>\ncan point you to the closest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the Sudbury Valley School site - so it&#39;s not an<br/>\nunschooler, exactly, but it sums up learning through life so well:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They&#39;d say, &quot;What did you learn today?&quot; and we&#39;d think, &quot;What did we<br/>\nlearn today? What are you talking about?&quot; Because it wasn&#39;t as if you<br/>\nwent into the library and learned your facts for the day. You had a<br/>\ndozen conversations with people. We weren&#39;t learning subject by<br/>\nsubject. We were learning in a much more organic manner. You would be<br/>\ndoing a lot of different things and you would learn them in little<br/>\nbits and pieces that would start adding up to much bigger pictures.<br/>\nYou wouldn&#39;t really know where it came from a lot of the time. By the<br/>\ntime you were done learning about something, information was coming<br/>\nfrom so many different sources, from books and from people you were<br/>\ntalking to, and from a long drawn out experience, that you had no idea<br/>\nhow you learned it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those bits and pieces to happen, support your son in doing what he<br/>\nloves to do - or even just likes! I&#39;ll say it again: it will not look<br/>\nlike school learning. But is IS learning, learning with your whole<br/>\nheart and mind and body. It&#39;s amazing and miraculous and such an<br/>\nincredible way to live! So even if you haven&#39;t let go in your mind,<br/>\npretend like you have in your actions.
