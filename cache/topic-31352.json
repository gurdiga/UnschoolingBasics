We talk about it all the time in our home.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is an issue is the exaggerated way in which sex is portrayed in<br/>\npornography.  Many young men (and women) think that that&#39;s how sex is<br/>\n&quot;done&quot;.  It puts in their minds the expectations of what sex should be<br/>\nlike/look like.  And visual images last much longer in the mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also the body image piece to contend with.  Human beings have so<br/>\nmuch to deal with when it comes to how we &quot;should&quot; look.  Porn is<br/>\nartificial.  The men and women are all a certain way of being.  I&#39;d like my<br/>\nchildren to not feel the added pressure of what &quot;beauty standards&quot; are being<br/>\nimposed in our society as it is.  Porn would just add to that struggle:<br/>\nlarge boobs, small waists, large penises (maybe), and buffed bodies.  I&#39;d<br/>\nlike my children to formulate their own thoughts on sex and beauty as much<br/>\nas possible without the aid of pornography.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow if they are interested in the human body and sex there are so many ways<br/>\nto explore that without resorting to porn.  And, at the very least, I would<br/>\nrather have them watching the adult films that are made by couples as an<br/>\naide to help other couples to have better sex.

But here I have the feeling I have to react.<br/>\nSorry for my English, I&#39;m from Holland.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first reaction was, why do you check his history?? In my opinion that&#39;s<br/>\nan invasion of his privacy. And of course he feels bad. You have been<br/>\nchecking up on him and you have been asking him about it. Or did you ask him<br/>\nabout all the sites you saw in his history?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is also 9 and looking at porn for about a year now. First he didin&#39;t<br/>\nwanted to talk about it but now he&#39;s more open about it. He used to be<br/>\nashamed when he saw me and my dh kissing but now he also free to see that as<br/>\nnormal and he can talk about intamicy and sex as normal subjects. It is more<br/>\nhow you react to it. When you act like sex is something to hide he will feel<br/>\nhe has to do the same thing. When you talk about it just like you talk about<br/>\nthe weather it wil be something normal to him too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe made some changes in our house to make sex more normal. For instance we<br/>\nused to dress our selves in private. Now when we want to change clothes we<br/>\njust say I&#39;m going to get undressed if you don&#39;t want to see me naked please<br/>\nlook away. At first they looked away, then they got curious and peeked and<br/>\nnow nobody is really interested anymore and the naked body is just as normal<br/>\nas a dressed one. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso we made porn just as available as cartoons. It&#39;s the same thing<br/>\n:entertainment. If someone wants to watch it, it is there. Don&#39;t get me<br/>\nwrong, sex is still something you enjoy privately alone or with someone who<br/>\nwant&#39;s to be with you too.but there is nothing to be ashamed about. It is a<br/>\nway to love yourself to learn about your feelings and your body (and others<br/>\nofcourseJ). And there is no pesific(?) age for sex just as there is no age<br/>\nfor reading, walking,talking, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you don&#39;t want all that stuff in his head. What stuff??? That sex<br/>\ncan make you feel really really good?  That it is ok to be comfortable with<br/>\nyour body(I don&#39;t think a pornstar is ashamed of his/her body)? That lust is<br/>\nok? That having sex without a marriage is ok? That sex with more people is<br/>\nok? What is it that makes you feel that porn is bad for you/ your child.?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why do you think he will have sex right now? Because he watches it? It<br/>\nis the same with movies and videogames. Because you see something it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nmean that you have to do it.  Even children have a mind of their ownJ . just<br/>\nlike you and me they can deside wheather they want to do something or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nLove laila <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of Stephanie Tavera<br/>\nSent: Friday, March 28, 2008 04:04<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Help 9 yo and porn!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I found out today that my son who is 9 years old has found out <br/>\nabout online porn.
