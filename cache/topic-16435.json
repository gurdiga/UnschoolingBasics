How do  you handle a situation <br/>\nlike this.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have a son who hit when he was younger, actually I think both of my boys  <br/>\nwent through this.  I think that age is hard.  They are not really  verbal yet, <br/>\ntrying to figure out the world with minimal tools for coping, and  problem <br/>\nsolving.  For us the hitting was one of the few ways my boys knew  to <br/>\ncommunicate.  It was a tool.  So we worked to provide better  tools.   <br/>\nWorking with my boys to verbalize feelings, even at that young age, and to  <br/>\nfigure out what they wanted or needed.  And working out solutions so that  they <br/>\nget what they want, without the hitting.  For us mutually agreeable  <br/>\nsolutions is what we strive for.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it helps to be able to see a situation before it gets to that point  <br/>\nof hitting.  Which doesn&#39;t always happen, LOL.  Then you can say  things like <br/>\n&quot;you seem to be getting frustrated, what can I do to help?&quot;  or  &quot;Do you need <br/>\nsomething?&quot;  It is easier to see what to say when you are  there, LOL.  But <br/>\nhelping them to see that they are getting emotional,  helping put words to those <br/>\nemotions, and helping them understand that it is OK  to want something and <br/>\nthere is a win-win solution.  When they were this  young they needed lots of <br/>\nhelp.  But by helping them then, I can see how  now they are able to take all of <br/>\nthat information, all of those tools and apply  it to their lives now (at 9 <br/>\nand 12) and they need so little help.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway this is early for me so sorry if the post doesn&#39;t make as much  sense, <br/>\nLOL.  I do co-own a list that is just for consensual living.   If you are <br/>\ninterested that is the name of it Consensual Living it is a yahoo  list.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16406,"nextTopicId":16428}}
