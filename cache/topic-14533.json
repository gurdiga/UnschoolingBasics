NEVER wet the bed or at home but CONSTANTLY wet <br/>\nat school.  I didn&#39;t realize how much of a problem it was for a very <br/>\nlong time. He would occasionally come home wet but told me it <br/>\nhappened on the bus.  The only time the school ever called me to <br/>\nbring him a change of clothes was on the last day of school (1st <br/>\ngrade).  That is when I found this out!  I had meetings with <br/>\nteachers and found out that he was not using the toilet at all.  He <br/>\nwould just go in his pants.    Now the first locked bathroom <br/>\nincident happened in kindergarten - this had been happening the <br/>\nwhole time.  He didn&#39;t have a wetting problem at home at that time <br/>\njust at school.  However it did evolve into an everyday problem.  <br/>\nDoctors told me there was nothing physically wrong with him - it was <br/>\npsychological.  My fault - he was looking for attention because <br/>\nbefore the problem started I was always there (room mom) and then I <br/>\nhad to go back to work.  It&#39;s funny how even  with the knowledge of <br/>\nwhat had happened it was still my fault.  Institutions like to stick <br/>\ntogether!  Thank God I didn&#39;t accept any of this!  If you can <br/>\nbelieve it my ds is 12 now and just recently has stopped wetting.  <br/>\nStill has the occasional accident but 99.9% improved.  I am so <br/>\ngrateful for the opportunity to be able to have my kids at home with <br/>\nthose who truly love and care for them and have a vested interest in <br/>\ntheir well being!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sabrina Hill<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":191187101,"authorName":"Sabrina Hill","from":"&quot;Sabrina Hill&quot; &lt;sbrehill@...&gt;","profile":"sbrehill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Pam, thank you for the great analogy","postDate":"1150303639","msgId":14583,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU2cGVpbis4ZHFoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA2MTQwNTQwazE3MzE0YTlhbWUzNGJlMDM4NTZiNzBjY0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":14559,"nextInTopic":14585,"prevInTime":14582,"nextInTime":14584,"topicId":14533,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  wrote: My response to him was, If you aren t going to ... we ... he ...

He pretty much just pretends the <br/>\nsituation doesn&#39;t exist.  Ok by me, for now anyway!  I have said to <br/>\nhim &quot;Hey listen to this...&quot; and read him an email, post or article <br/>\non the subject.  He listens and then just quietly walks away.  I <br/>\nhave stopped pushing mostly because he has stopped griping!  We all <br/>\nlive in our own little worlds I guess, but whatever works for now is <br/>\nfine with me.  Hopefully he will come around.  We have already seen <br/>\nso many positive changes in our children, which is probably why he <br/>\nhas been so quiet.  He doesn&#39;t want to admit that I was right and <br/>\nunschooling actually works!  The only time he says anything now is <br/>\nwhen my kids are figuring out some sort of math problem they have <br/>\nencountered.  My dh is a math whiz.  He was in Mu Alpha Theta and <br/>\ntook honors calculus in HS.  He gets very frustrated when he sees <br/>\nthe kids having trouble with simple math that they were doing with <br/>\nno problem while in PS.  Math is a very high priority for him.  I <br/>\nwas so traumatised by math as a child that I was lucky to pass <br/>\ngeneral math classes in hs and even had to take a remedial math <br/>\nclass in order to go to college.

It moved me soooo much! Let me tell <br/>\nyou a little background.<br/>\nI had been a (non-certified) teacher in an elementary parochial <br/>\nschool off and on for about 15 yrs. My 5th grade ds was having some <br/>\nanger management and emotional problems so the school (public)<br/>\nrecommended I have him evaluated.  The &quot;doctor&quot; said he was <br/>\ndisturbed and showed signs of trauma and psychosis! He had never <br/>\nbeen traumatised by anything that I could think of! WELL, unless you <br/>\ncount being accidentally left on the playground at the head-start <br/>\nprogram he attended for preschool or being accidentally locked in <br/>\nthe bathroom AND left there while everyone else in the class went <br/>\noutside -TWICE - once in kindergarten and again in 2nd grade! I was <br/>\nfloored -my sweet little boy psychotic? NO WAY! So I tried to get <br/>\nthe schools assistance with this! What a waste of everyone&#39;s time!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, after doing some research and deciding that the system was <br/>\nfailing my son, I decided to homeschool him, surely I could do <br/>\nbetter. I figured with what they were doing to him that even if I <br/>\nnever taught him a thing he would be better off than he was in their <br/>\nnot so capable hands!  With my (now admitted) holier than thou <br/>\nteaching background I was the last person to think that <br/>\nhomeschooling was a good idea - I thought only extremist wackos did <br/>\nthat! ((((BOY I&#39;M GLAD I WAS WRONG AND GLAD TO ONE OF THEM!))))  So, <br/>\nI withdrew him from school and loved having him home so much that I <br/>\nsoon withdrew my 2nd grade dd. I took my now 12 yo ds out of PS a <br/>\nlittle over a year ago, then a few months later my 7 yo dd. I still <br/>\nhad one dd in HS (10th grade - she did not want to leave her <br/>\nfriends). So, against MY better judgement, I left her there. Since <br/>\nthen we have moved to another state and she decided to hs. YAY!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nI have looked into unschooling (obviously since I am on this board) <br/>\nsince the beginning but my husband is TOTALLY not into the whole <br/>\nidea of homeschooling much less unschooling. He has NO desire to <br/>\nread ANYTHING or at the very least talk about the issue!  I have had <br/>\nto fight every step of the way. I even had to take them out of ps <br/>\nwithout his blessing (I don&#39;t ask permission for ANYTHING - lol!). <br/>\nNeedless to say that was a rough patch to get through - but here we <br/>\nare none-the-less! I tried the school at home thing for a while - <br/>\nmostly to please dh, but seeing the frustration in all of us <br/>\nreturning started to back off and just have fun.  &quot;If&quot; learning <br/>\nhappened great!  We really only did &quot;school&quot; when dh had a day off.<br/>\n  Then we found out we had to move and with getting ready for that <br/>\nmove - shucks - there was just no time for &quot;school&quot;. It has now been <br/>\nabout 7 months since the move and I just keep putting off school. I <br/>\nkeep finding excuses not to start. Thinking to myself that we will <br/>\njust stay like this and lean more towards unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT,<br/>\n (you knew this was coming didn&#39;t you?) <br/>\nlately I have been getting worried about my dd and going to college. <br/>\nI talked to her about it today and she says that she wants to go to <br/>\ncollege because &quot;she knows she should&quot;. I told her that she didn&#39;t <br/>\nnecessarily HAVE to if her interests took her elsewhere (and now I <br/>\nfeel like I am being selfish and almost trying to talk her out of <br/>\nit!). She is very interested in art, especially photography. A local <br/>\nphoto shop owner has offered to show her how to develop her own B/W <br/>\nfilm and I am going to arrange a volunteer position at our local <br/>\nlittle theater working behind the scenes (she says she is too shy <br/>\nfor anything to do with acting). When I told her about the <br/>\nopportunities she was really enthusiastic and said she wanted to do <br/>\nit! I know her attitude towards college comes from my dh. Who by the <br/>\nway went to college for four years, has two degrees and a <br/>\ncertificate, none of which are worth the paper they are printed on <br/>\nbecause he doesn&#39;t use them or the &quot;education&quot; they came with in any <br/>\nway and never has (whew!). But anyway, I am just so scared that with <br/>\nonly 2 years left (technically speaking), if I don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; her <br/>\nshe won&#39;t be able to get into art school or college at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet ready for this! ------ <br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking into getting a unit studies curriculum to begin in the <br/>\nfall. I am so confused right now from reading so much info that my <br/>\nhead is spinning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I read your post!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your analogy - I was moved to tears because I<br/>\nreally do feel exactly that way inside but these superficial fears<br/>\nand of course my husband breathing schooling down my neck are about<br/>\nto drive me insane!!!  It feels like a huge weight has been lifted <br/>\noff my shoulders and boy does it feel liberating!  Now that I&#39;ve <br/>\ntaken this first step I can&#39;t wait to see what the future holds for <br/>\nall of us!  I am most excited for my youngest son who, with the <br/>\ngrace of god, will never have to do &quot;school&quot;.  Unless of course that <br/>\nis what he chooses for himself!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and by the way - my ds is no longer &quot;psychotic&quot;, &quot;angry&quot;<br/>\nor &quot;disturbed&quot; in any way!(in my eyes never was) I believe<br/>\nwholeheartedly it was the school which made him act like he was - <br/>\nthey are the ones responsible for inflicting the &quot;trauma&quot;!<br/>\nTemporary insanity if you will - brought on by a system which was<br/>\nstifling, abusive and oppressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so there you have it. So sorry for such a long post but it has<br/>\nbeen a long time coming! Thanks to all who have listened.
