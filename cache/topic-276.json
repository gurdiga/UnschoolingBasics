It&#39;s at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>\nI adjust this for us. I use a pretty generic list of books and suppilies.<br/>\nGlobe, library, etc. It&#39;s about the same every year. It&#39;s really quite<br/>\nsimple but I was quite nervious our first year or so. Assessments are a<br/>\nmatter of finding the right reveiwer. There are a few to choose from around<br/>\nhere. I use the box method. Throw stuff in a box through the year and take<br/>\nit to the reveiwer with pictures and calandar too. LOL!<br/>\nI guess this will be my intro too. LOL! I&#39;m Barb E obviously from Ohio.<br/>\nOutside Columbus to be more exact. I have 3 boys. 18yo, 14yo, and soon to be<br/>\n10yo. We&#39;ve been unschooling for eight years going on nine. Deschooling just<br/>\nevolved into unschooling for us. I was fortunate enough to go to the last 2<br/>\nunschooling conferences in SC. They were fabulous! Unfortunately we won&#39;t be<br/>\nable to attend this year. We moved to a bigger and better<br/>\nplace/neighborhood. Money is very tight but we are much happier and safer. I<br/>\nstart working next week part time moving into fulltime in the fall.<br/>\nDs 14 wants to try out high school next year. I&#39;m gritting my teeth but it&#39;s<br/>\nhis choice and he knows he can come back home at any time. Oh and Melissa.<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a private school option other than online schools. If you want<br/>\nto call it that. I think you may have been thinking of an unbrella school.<br/>\nYou could pay big bucks for Clonlara but you still have that &quot;have to do&quot;<br/>\nmentality. They take care of your assessment but you still notify the state<br/>\nlike everyone else that are homeschooling independently. Online schoolsare<br/>\npublic school at home in my opinion.<br/>\nFeel free to contact me off list for more particulars.
