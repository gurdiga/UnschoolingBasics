There are two practice exams, plus a  <br/>\ndiagnostic exam, included. It describes the CHSPE and goes, in  <br/>\ndetail, into everything covered on the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tutor kids who want to take the CHSPE.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, the CHSPE rules say the kid has to be 16 or in the 2nd  <br/>\nsemester of 10th grade to be eligible to take the test. Homeschoolers  <br/>\nget around that all the time by listing the kid&#39;s grade as 11th  <br/>\ngrade, no matter how old the kid is. My oldest daughter took it at 14  <br/>\nand passed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason you&#39;re having trouble getting information about &quot;credit&quot;  <br/>\nout of the college might be because they don&#39;t even fully understand  <br/>\nthe question. They have no authority to give &quot;high school credit.&quot;  <br/>\nThey are not a high school. If you (as a private high school, want to  <br/>\ngive high school credit for college courses, that&#39;s up to you, not  <br/>\nthem. They are a college - when they give &quot;credit&quot; it is college  <br/>\ncredit - the only distinction for them is whether it is  <br/>\n&quot;transferrable&quot; or &quot;nontransferrable&quot; to 4-year colleges and  <br/>\nuniversities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of homeschooled kids in California take the CHSPE because it  <br/>\nlets them enroll in community college just like any other college  <br/>\nstudent - as a &quot;high school graduate&quot; they don&#39;t have to get special  <br/>\nsignatures and fill out extra forms just because they are under age.  <br/>\nThey can still take community college classes, for credit, without  <br/>\nthe CHSPE, at most ccs, but having passed the CHSPE makes the  <br/>\napplication and registration process easier. On the other hand, most  <br/>\nof the cc&#39;s don&#39;t charge any tuition to nongraduated, under-age  <br/>\nstudents, so it is often worth jumping through the extra hoops in  <br/>\norder to save the $26 (soon to be $20) per unit fees.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other big thing passing the CHSPE does is allow them to work  <br/>\nwithout having to obtain a work permit or obey minor work hours/days  <br/>\nrestrictions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Nov 9, 2006, at 6:20 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:airokat@...\">airokat@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; My understanding is that if a child is under the age of 16, they  <br/>\n&gt; cannot get college credit for community college courses, only High  <br/>\n&gt; School Credit.

She wants to prep for the California High School Proficiency Exam, which is the legal equivalent of a diploma. I know that as a private school I can issue her a diploma, but somehow that seems wrong to me at this time, since I have nothing to put on a transcript, should I ever be asked to provide one for any reason. I am also not sure what kind of example that would set for my daughter to just say &quot;you want a transcript?&quot; Heres one. Right now she is completely unschooling, and enjoying it, but she chose to take a photography class at the community college and is a bit bugged by the fact that due to her age, she wont get college credit. All this is complicated by the fact that we are both deschooling and I know that both of us havent entirely shrugged off all the schoo<br/>\nlish notions. How do you deal with the diploma issue? Any feedback regarding this that will help me see things from an unschooling perspective is appreciated. <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18769,"nextTopicId":18828}}
