Like yours, he values <br/>\nthe evenings to unwind, watch TV, catch up with each other etc. etc.  <br/>\nIt was a real sticking point for us and he resisted A LOT!! I really <br/>\nstruggled with making sure everyone&#39;s needs were met during this <br/>\nparticular transition and confess to pretty much railroading my ever-<br/>\npatient partner on more than one occasion...*sigh* ;}<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that in the beginning, Savannah (5yo) was just so excited to <br/>\nbe up and about until SHE wanted to go to sleep that she spent a few <br/>\nweeks being fairly manic in the evenings...which drove hubby crazy <br/>\nand made it harder to convince him that this really WAS a good <br/>\nthing!  After several family discussions we agreed that it was <br/>\nimportant that everyone should be able to enjoy their evening in <br/>\ntheir own way, but not to infringe upon other family members <br/>\nenjoyment. ie. if Savannah was feeling bouncy, she should bounce <br/>\nsomewhere other than in front of the TV that Daddy was watching his <br/>\nnews program on.  Eventually, after the &#39;novelty&#39; of it wore off, <br/>\nSavannah started to naturally migrate up to her room for quiet time - <br/>\nwe would read or chat or watch TV...she would wander up and down the <br/>\nstairs from time to time, checking in on us but not in the <br/>\nold &#39;what&#39;s everyone else doing?&#39; way, just when she thought of <br/>\nsomething she wanted to tell us or to get a drink or snack...I guess <br/>\nshe finally realized we&#39;re not all that exciting after dark! ;}  <br/>\nAlso, she and dh started watching some TV programs together...they <br/>\nwatch the Simpsons, Iron Chef, stuff on the Discovery channel...they <br/>\nconnect really well that way. She asks a bezillion questions, they <br/>\ntalk, they learn, they spend quiet time together....<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the day came, not so long ago, that in the middle of a favourite <br/>\nshow, Savannah announced that she was tired and wanted me to go and <br/>\ntuck her into bed! I suppressed a triumphant grin as my hubby looked <br/>\nquite disappointed that she was leaving before the end of the <br/>\nprogram...;}<br/>\n<br/>\nTime and gradual transitioning I think is the key. I think my mistake <br/>\nwas trying to do everything at once.  I was so enthusiastic about the <br/>\nwhole idea, I wanted to do it all, RIGHT NOW!  Only when I stopped, <br/>\ntook a deep breath and slowed down, did things start to fall into <br/>\nplace. And it meant a lot of changes.  I&#39;ve made the choice to stay <br/>\nup until my kids are asleep..which at its latest is about <br/>\n11:30pm...not my ideal - I&#39;m an early-to-bed-early-to-rise type <br/>\nnaturally, so it&#39;s been a stretch out of my comfort zone to do this, <br/>\nbut it *feels* right to be with them right now. Given the conditions <br/>\nconducive to sleep, but without someone telling them WHEN they will <br/>\ncertainly begin to listen to the cues their bodies are giving them.  <br/>\nMy son, (3.75) prefers to fall asleep in the playroom while watching <br/>\na movie...we dim the lights, he picks his final movie and asks me <br/>\nto &#39;cozy up&#39;...snuggles, tucking in of blankets etc. then I leave him <br/>\nuntil he&#39;s asleep and carry him upstairs to bed. Because the playroom <br/>\nis in the basement I&#39;m not comfortable leaving him there as we are <br/>\ntwo stories above him, so I wait to carry him up before falling <br/>\ngratefully asleep myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the long post, but I wanted you to know that you&#39;re not <br/>\nalone in your struggles to help your hubby embrace this particular <br/>\naspect of unschooling.

This quote came up on  <br/>\nAlwaysLearning, generated on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site, which may be  <br/>\nappropriate here:<br/>\n<br/>\n~ It has more to do with why people are doing what they are doing and<br/>\nwhat they believe about it than WHAT they are doing.— Sandra Dodd ~<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really isn&#39;t about &quot;no bedtime&quot; in unschooling families. It  <br/>\ndefinitely doesn&#39;t mean leaving kids to their own devices. It&#39;s more  <br/>\nabout helping kids understand their bodies&#39; need for sleep, the cues  <br/>\ntheir bodies give them and also creating an environment conducive to  <br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anyone is saying that they don&#39;t take the family&#39;s  <br/>\n(including partner&#39;s) needs seriously. There are ways to get all your  <br/>\nneeds met, including yours. It takes some creativity and flexibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at what your children want and need (connection with you,  <br/>\nfun, attention, eventual sleep &lt;g&gt;), perhaps you can see it  <br/>\ndifferently. My dd had a natural late-night rhythm and a physically  <br/>\nactive period in the evening. However, she did want to settle down  <br/>\neventually and nurse to sleep because she craved that connection with  <br/>\nme. When she no longer nursed to sleep, I read to her and we snuggled  <br/>\nto sleep. It was rarely difficult because her needs were being met. I  <br/>\ncould even adjust the timing to a bit earlier in the evening if  <br/>\nnecessary, because we were together. She also slept with us for a long  <br/>\ntime, since she didn&#39;t want to sleep alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize meeting three kids&#39; needs is more challenging than one, but  <br/>\nI know families with more than one child have figured it out in ways  <br/>\nthat work for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould your three-year old be happy to bring her markers and paper into  <br/>\nbed while you settle the baby? This might require using old sheets  <br/>\nthat could be marked up, or you could give her fabric markers and she  <br/>\ncould make new and beautiful patterns. Give her old pillowcases that  <br/>\nshe can cut holes in, or soft fabric cords that wouldn&#39;t disturb your  <br/>\nsleep if you rolled over on them. This is where creativity can come in!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may sound completely wacky to you and it&#39;s only one of many  <br/>\navenues you could explore. But, it has a completely different feel to  <br/>\nit than her up by herself with markers, paper and scissors while you  <br/>\nare elsewhere. Could she play beside you, instead? You could then  <br/>\ntransition to reading to her and encouraging her sleepiness. You can  <br/>\nhelp her understand everyone&#39;s need for quiet and sleep time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your dh has a need for quiet time, can you move your sleep ritual  <br/>\nto another room? Maybe he will look at bedtime rituals as a way for  <br/>\nhim to connect with the kids, too, and still get his own time before  <br/>\nor after.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese aren&#39;t the only things you can do, but it might give you a start  <br/>\nof thinking of how to change things up for everyone. Most times, it&#39;s  <br/>\nadjusting our *ideas* about sleep (or food, or tv). It requires seeing  <br/>\nthings from a different point of view entirely and working within a  <br/>\nnew framework. Seeing your kids&#39; needs as something to work *with*  <br/>\ninstead of against is a big shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that same post on Always Learning, Sandra wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about when your kids go to sleep, it&#39;s about why they go to<br/>\nsleep, how they feel about it, whether they chose to or were forced<br/>\nto (as if you can force someone to sleep, not counting drugs, which<br/>\nmy mom&#39;s cousin used to do--and probably badillion others in the<br/>\n1940&#39;s; she gave them peregoric, which is opium).<br/>\n<br/>\nEwww.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, and (especially on unschooling lists &lt;g&gt;) it can also be important  <br/>\nto examine your thinking about children&#39;s needs by watching how you  <br/>\nsay things (language influences our thinking and vice versa). Saying  <br/>\nan infant &quot;has taken up a nasty habit&quot; shuts off the path to  <br/>\nunderstanding *why* a baby might have changed his or her sleep  <br/>\npatterns. You may have meant it innocently, but when you look at that  <br/>\nstatement, it seems you are saying your baby is doing something  <br/>\nexpressly to upset you. I don&#39;t imagine that&#39;s it at all :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342833460,"authorName":"Amanda Pillow","from":"Amanda Pillow &lt;funkymamaof4@...&gt;","profile":"funkymamaof4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: What should I do?","postDate":"1218038317","msgId":35167,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc1MzU4OC45NTYwMi5xbUB3ZWI1NzMwNi5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDBDRTdBQ0Y5MzkxNzRGMEZBRTkzNUY3QTJCNTA0MEY3QGRlbGw2Yzk5NzBhNDZjPg=="},"prevInTopic":35161,"nextInTopic":35172,"prevInTime":35166,"nextInTime":35168,"topicId":35110,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I totally feel you on the concern about what the little ones do when left to thier own devices.

If you can&#39;t stay up super late because of an early <br/>\nmorning  committment, then you need to explain that to the kids.  <br/>\nThat is real life learning and you&#39;re modeling life for them.  If <br/>\nthey choose to stay up late, the family needs to work together to <br/>\nmeet everyone&#39;s needs without disrespecting other family members.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn our home, the working parent is Dad (my husband).  He likes to go <br/>\nto bed around 10:30pm.  When he goes to bed, the rest of us do quiet <br/>\nthings so as not to disturb his sleep.  We can still watch tv, play <br/>\ngames together, read, be on the internet, etc.  Sometimes I go to bed <br/>\naround 11pm because I just can&#39;t keep my eyes open.  My kids can stay <br/>\nup, doing the same quiet things as when I&#39;m awake.  When we let go of <br/>\nbedtimes, it did seem like we were having a slumber party every <br/>\nnight.  The kids were so excited at being awake past bedtime!  But <br/>\nover time, the thrill has gone away and now we just do our own things <br/>\nand sleep when we feel ready to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also had to be creative to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  Sometimes <br/>\nmy kids want to stay up watching tv but they were uncomfortable in <br/>\nthe living room alone.  They have a tv, computer and video game <br/>\nsystem in their room along with their toys, books and collections.  <br/>\n<br/>\nExplaining unschooling to an unsupportive family member can be <br/>\ntricky.

Instead of say, 9pm, make it 10 or 11pm. Use that time to  <br/>\nplay and sew and craft. Then at that time ask about baths, snuggles,  <br/>\nstories. Also, if they were already laying around watching a movie, I  <br/>\nprobably would have just covered them with blankets and said, I&#39;m  <br/>\ngoing to bed, I&#39;ll see you in the morning. My five year old is  <br/>\nprobably the best for leaving alone...he knows the expectations: We  <br/>\ndon&#39;t go outside, we play quietly while others are sleeping, no  <br/>\ncooking without mom.

Finally, at 3:30<br/>\n&gt; am, I was sooooooo exhausted, I had to go to bed. (I get up every<br/>\n&gt; morning at 5:30 am because I have an online business, and I work on<br/>\n&gt; my craft and business at that time, before the kids are up, so I can<br/>\n&gt; spend the rest of the day with them.) So I told them we had to go<br/>\n&gt; ahead and go to bed. They were half asleep and were not happy about<br/>\n&gt; going to bed at 3:30am. Should I have let them stay up while I went<br/>\n&gt; to bed?

I introduced myself, but have not had a question til now.  I <br/>\nknow you all cover many, many topics in this group, but I have a <br/>\nspecific one for my situation.  Thanks for reading...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are a family of four kids, myself, and my husband.  We have for my <br/>\nyears now, been very &#39;mainstream&#39; in our parenting..ie, <br/>\npunishment/reward system, public school, curriculum based <br/>\nhomeschooling, etc.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  I found <br/>\nout about unschooling as regards to a method for *learning* and fell <br/>\nhard and fast for it, really feeling in my heart like it was how it <br/>\nshould have been all along.  More recently, I have began reading and <br/>\nlearning more about unschooling as a &#39;lifestyle&#39;....ie, respect, <br/>\nbedtimes, etc.  I had a hard time swallowing the *no bedtime* <br/>\nsuggestion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other evening, though, I decided I would try it. Let the kids <br/>\ndecide when they go to bed. (Now, I don&#39;t know if I went about this <br/>\nall wrong, and I hope you can tell me otherwise if I &#39;messed up&#39;) <br/>\nThey were thrilled.  They range in age from 5-10 and I stayed up with <br/>\nthem.  We had a great time.  We dug in my scrap box of fabric, picked <br/>\nout fabric, hand-sewed a little, watched a movie.  Finally, at 3:30 <br/>\nam, I was sooooooo exhausted, I had to go to bed. (I get up every <br/>\nmorning at 5:30 am because I have an online business, and I work on <br/>\nmy craft and business at that time, before the kids are up, so I can <br/>\nspend the rest of the day with them.) So I told them we had to go <br/>\nahead and go to bed.  They were half asleep and were not happy about <br/>\ngoing to bed at 3:30am.  Should I have let them stay up while I went <br/>\nto bed?  They are only 5,6,7 and 10, and I was afraid for their <br/>\nsafety, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, we told my husband about them staying up late and decided he <br/>\ndid not like the fact I was &quot;letting them do as they please&quot;, etc.  <br/>\nIt has caused problems in our relationship and I don&#39;t know how to <br/>\nexplain it to him, or how to &#39;get him on board&#39;.  He is very <br/>\ntraditional in his parenting &#39;skills&#39;... which from what I am <br/>\nlearning, we have BOTH been way off on our &#39;skills&#39;.  I am trying to <br/>\ndo better as a parent, but I don&#39;t know how to handle that he won&#39;t <br/>\nlisten to me about what I am trying to do. I caved in and for the <br/>\npast few nights have been putting them to bed at a &#39;decent&#39; hour, and <br/>\nit has been hell here.  They were instantly in great moods and even <br/>\n*gasp* getting along better just from that one night..(although my <br/>\nfollow-through with it failed.) Now, they are confused because I seem <br/>\nto be vascilating (sp?) back and forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried talking to my mother (who is normally very open-minded) and <br/>\nshe thinks the techniques for living this way will result in (and I <br/>\nquote) &#39;panty-waist kids who think they are entitled to every little <br/>\nwhim&#39;.  Well.. it ticked me off and I feel very frustrated and quite <br/>\nlonely right now.  If someone has any suggestions, it would be <br/>\nappreciated.
