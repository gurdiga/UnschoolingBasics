The quote above suggests a good example - there&#39;s a lot more hype about kids&#39; health and safety these days, and some of it is pretty over the top! The same kind of hype pervades all aspects of parenting: OMG, I&#39;ve Got to get my 3yo in a ballet class or I&#39;ll be Wasting her Potential! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a nice blog post by Ronnie Maier about being uncomfortable that I like, along this topic. Parenting isn&#39;t always smooth and effortless, but it can help a lot to step away from culturally induced messages of panic to something more like simple discomfort. Its okay to be uncomfortable with kids&#39; choices sometimes - better to be uncomfortable than freaked out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zombieprincess.blogspot.com/2010/06/joy-of-being-uncomfortable.html\">http://zombieprincess.blogspot.com/2010/06/joy-of-being-uncomfortable.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: deschooling from extreme thinking","postDate":"1300190921","msgId":46362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlsbmtzOSthY3RwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlsbHB1cis4ZG1yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46360,"nextInTopic":46363,"prevInTime":46361,"nextInTime":46363,"topicId":46358,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It was easier to start hsing and then unschooling because DS was so out-of-step at public school.

Parents feel pressure to make the most Perfect decisions about pregnancy, birth, nursing, sleep, diapers - and then good grief the pressure to choose the most perfect preschool so the kid will get into the most perfect college down the road. There&#39;s a looooot of pressure on parents to make not just thoughtful choices, but perfect ones, and that sets up a whole lot of extreme thinking. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of deschooling for parents often involves learning to step away from the extremes that pervade the way we relate to our kids. Its very common for folks new to unschooling to frame things in extreme terms - terms of obsession or poison that make decisions seem simple. Those kinds of ideas can get in the way of being able to see kids for who they are as people though. Decisions about people and relationships are nuancy.
