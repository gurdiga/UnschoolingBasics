And still  unschooling.  <br/>\nHe&#39;s able to do this because Goddard is extremely  non-traditional, and <br/>\nEVERYTHING comes from Julian. He has total flexibility and  options to switch gears <br/>\nwhen he wants to, and he is loving it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting -- I went to Hampshire College, a non-traditional, hippy  <br/>\nsorta place where everyone designs their own majors. And I adored it, and it  <br/>\nruined me for traditional education, which is one of the things that led me to  <br/>\nunschooling. That said, for unschoolers who don&#39;t care about a regular  <br/>\nresidential program, I think Goddard is the place to be. Amazing program (and  <br/>\nconsiderably more affordable than most other places.)<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn  <br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the  Northeast Unschooling conference Memorial Day Weekend, May 23-25 <br/>\n2008 in  Peabody, Massachusetts _www.northeastunschoolingconference.com_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************Check out AOL&#39;s list of 2007&#39;s hottest <br/>\nproducts.<br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)\">http://money.aol.com/special/hot-products-2007?NCID=aoltop00030000000001)</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28283,"nextTopicId":28287}}
