He is definately a touchy-feely kind of<br/>\nlearner. He has a one-on-one aide at school, thankfully, and can get up<br/>\nand move around when ever he wants to - they even leave the class room.<br/>\nI dont believe he would have gotten this help if it werent for state<br/>\nintervention. The school would have pushed for more medications and<br/>\nblame the parents. That is my experience anyway and one of the major<br/>\nreasons why I unschool my two youngest boys.<br/>\nI feel the same about the &quot;new label&quot; of bipolar. If a child holds it<br/>\ntogether/squashes their feelings for the most part, then &quot;looses it&quot; and<br/>\nbecome angry/rageful they are labelled bipolar and some people/adults<br/>\nbecome happy that the problem is solved. I have a stubborn bold streak<br/>\nand wouldnt take their label of one of my kids. After he was out of<br/>\nschool his symptoms completely disappeared. Imagine that. They had<br/>\nwanted him on Lithium. Something in me was screaming &quot;no&quot; even with all<br/>\nthe pressure of the school people telling me he was a lost cause. They<br/>\nalso blamed me and told me I was a very bad mother. The shame overtook<br/>\nme for awhile yet, I still knew in my gut that something was wrong with<br/>\nthe picture and was strong enough and courageous enough to follow my<br/>\ninstincts.
