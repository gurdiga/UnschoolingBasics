If you are going to hs why do an iep?  Especially if you are<br/>\ngoing to unschool?  We don&#39;t use a guideline to determine what our children<br/>\n&quot;need&quot; to know.  They learn what they need when they need it.  eip&#39;s are<br/>\nused by the school system so that they can &quot;catch up&quot; the &quot;special ed kids&quot;<br/>\nwith the rest of their grade level.

You have labeled her.  Your frustration has labelled<br/>\nher as well.  She probably has the mindset that she can&#39;t do it.  What are<br/>\nher interests?  What does she want to do?  My son wants to be a chef with a<br/>\nsmall garden. That&#39;s his life goal (at almost 8 yo and I wouldn&#39;t doubt it<br/>\nthat he achieves that goal!)  Guess what we do?  We do lots of cooking,<br/>\nbaking, poaching, kneading, boiling, and herb gardening.  He may never be<br/>\n&quot;on track&quot; with other people his age, but the boy will know how to cook :)<br/>\nWhat does your daughter want to do?  What interests her and sparks her<br/>\ncreativity?  Focus on that.  When she has need of working out problems she<br/>\nwill.  It might surprise you that she *can* work out problems like her math<br/>\nword problems, but they relate to the things that she is interested in.  We<br/>\ndo that as adults.  Most of us given a grade school word problem would<br/>\nprobably balk at it, but we can figure out how much food to make for dinner,<br/>\nhow many stitches we need to increase on a knitting project, and how much<br/>\nmoney it is going to take with the current gas prices to go on that vacation<br/>\nto grandma&#39;s house next month.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just have run out of<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make her understand concepts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What concepts do you think she is not getting?  Does she need those concepts<br/>\nor does the school system with its arbitrary list of &quot;should knows&quot; think<br/>\nshe needs those concepts?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering how not only will she get<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; &gt; a &quot;diploma&quot; but more importantly how is she going to make it in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; life if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she cant reason.She can not do any word problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does she need to be able to do word problems.  World problems are fairly<br/>\nabstract to many people.  &quot;Jenny has 5 peaches.  June has 7 peaches.  Mary<br/>\nhas 2 peaches.  A pie needs 3 peaches.  How many pies can Jenny, June and<br/>\nMary make with their peaches and how many pies does each girl get to take<br/>\nhome based on her contribution?&quot;  ACK!! Who the heck cares about Jenny, June<br/>\nand Mary, their pies or how many THEY can make??  We don&#39;t work that way in<br/>\nreal life.  In real life Jenny, June and Mary would get together and put all<br/>\ntheir peaches into as many pies as they could and most likely would evenly<br/>\ndivide them pu between the 3 of them because Mary may have donated the pie<br/>\nshells and all the cooking was done at June&#39;s house and the only thing Jenny<br/>\ncontributed was peaches!  See, for some of us there is a lot of missing<br/>\ninformation to this word problem.  There are other factors that aren&#39;t<br/>\nbrought up.  But a peach pie sounds really good right now.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether your daughter needs a &quot;diploma&quot; (which BTW can be printed on most<br/>\nany home computer)and the ability to figure out word problems is all going<br/>\nto depend on what SHE wants to do in life.  There are hundreds of careers<br/>\nthat she could go into (including motherhood) where a diploma and the<br/>\nability to solve word problems isn&#39;t going to be a factor at all!  And if<br/>\nshe does want to go into a career that requires she have a diploma and be<br/>\nable to solve word problems, then she will find a way to make that happen.<br/>\nMy middle child wants to take over the world and thinks that her best<br/>\nvantage point will be Switzerland, so she is teaching herself French,<br/>\nItalian and German so she will be able to better communicate in<br/>\nSwitzerland.  (Yes; Ren, be afraid!  Be very afraid!)  Since your daughter<br/>\nis a teenager, I would recommend the Teenage Liberation Handbook for both of<br/>\nyou!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCatch our new wave of color!<br/>\nBook a March show!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New- with some questions","postDate":"1142959345","msgId":10969,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzRDREQjU5LTNDOUMtNEE1QS05ODRBLUI5ODE0Rjg0MzNENkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGR2cDhuaitkMmNsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGR2cDhuaitkMmNsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10968,"nextInTopic":10970,"prevInTime":10968,"nextInTime":10970,"topicId":10953,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Two of mine were, i just sent a certified letter saying that effective on such and such date, I would be refusing special services as stated in our IEP.
