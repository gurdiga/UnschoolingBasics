Those things are <br/>\nhuge. <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep up what you are doing and help him learn what he likes. Kids who <br/>\nlive trying to appease unwell adults do not know what they like <br/>\nbecause so much of their energy is spent trying to keep the adult <br/>\nhappy. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo remember that once he begins to be able to open his little heart <br/>\nnot only may he learn what he likes he may also tap into all those <br/>\nbig negative feelings that had to be put on hold to take care of a <br/>\nmentally ill parent. Those can be big and overwhelming for the kid <br/>\nand us.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like right now he is in shock and honeymooning. Keep <br/>\nlistening, talking and identifying feelings. And remember you are not <br/>\nteaching but sharing by example what respectful life is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember whatever happens to this boy the respect, and dignity you <br/>\nshow him will not be lost. FOSTER CARE&lt; BTW THIS BOY IS NOT A FOSTER <br/>\nCHILD&lt; BUT A CHILD IN FOSTER CARE&gt; is meant to be temporary, but it <br/>\nis a  commitment to be significant in a childs lifetime. <br/>\n<br/>\nIT IS GREAT WORK!<br/>\n<br/>\nHUGS TO YOU ALL&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKathleen<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso caution, food becomes one of the biggest issues in parenting <br/>\nsomeone elses child.

My heart goes out to that boy you have. Is he your first ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2142933653\">Hi Lisa,<br/>\nI have some experience with fostering (I had two children for a combined<br/>\nfour years). My heart goes out to that boy you have. Is he your first<br/>\nplacement? From reading your description, there are a few things I can tell<br/>\nyou for sure:<br/>\n1. &quot;A few days&quot; tuns into a few weeks/months/and sometimes years a LOT of<br/>\nthe time. Just talk to other foster parents. Then again, he can be removed<br/>\nwithin very short notice at any point. If you want to be prepared to help<br/>\nthis child as much as possible (long term, short term) you need to plan for<br/>\nboth situations and everything in between, and &quot;strategize&quot; accordingly.<br/>\n2. All that acting out you&#39;re waiting for him to do? It will happen! He&#39;s in<br/>\nhis &quot;honeymoon stage&quot; now, and for him it sounds like being as unobtrusive<br/>\nas possible is his way to try and &quot;be good&quot;. For my daughter it was months<br/>\nof going out of her way to be super sweet and helpful ALL the time. For my<br/>\nson it was smiling and acting happy. Heartbreaking in every case, when you<br/>\nknew there was so much hurt inside of them. The honeymoon will eventually be<br/>\nover. Somehow, besides wondering how to help him NOW, which of course you<br/>\nmust, try to get ready for things to change (maybe gradually, maybe<br/>\nsuddenly, I&#39;ve seen it both ways, too).<br/>\n3. Yes, I believe there is a way to help a child gradually start functioning<br/>\nin a free environment, and yes, he definitely NEEDS to be treated not by his<br/>\nchronological age all the time, but his emotional age. He&#39;s giving you<br/>\npretty big hints right now of how he wants to be parented! This will be<br/>\nchallenging to say the least, and you may have to go way back to what his<br/>\ndevelopmental needs might have been at a very early age. Follow his lead. If<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t take a towel from the counter after you&#39;ve pointed them out,<br/>\nimagine having to SHOW a less-than-independent 2 year old (not once, but<br/>\nafter many repetitions maybe) how you take the towel and wrap him in it,<br/>\nthen dry himself up, get dressed and hang up the towel (or whatever the<br/>\nroutine is at your house - we use ours for several days then take them to<br/>\nthe laundry all at once and get new ones from the linen closet). Snack, same<br/>\nthing, sounds to me like he needs showing (as opposed to telling) and lots<br/>\nof reassuring that it&#39;s good to eat those snacks you put out. It&#39;s obvious<br/>\nhe hasn&#39;t had enough to eat before, from what you say about heaping his<br/>\nplate. Hoarding and binging are common among foster kids, along other eating<br/>\ndisorders. I think your approach about storing leftovers is very positive<br/>\nand will probably get through to him in time,  but it may take much longer<br/>\nthan two weeks for him to &quot;get it&quot;. At the same time it may help to model<br/>\nwhen you&#39;re helping yourself to food, even if it sounds obvious or<br/>\nmanipulative to you, just &quot;think outloud&quot; or have a conversation with one of<br/>\nyour other kids about &quot;how much X do you think would be enough&quot; as you serve<br/>\nyour own plate. Another thing that helped my kids was &quot;firsts&quot; and &quot;seconds&quot;<br/>\n- they knew they could always have seconds if they didn&#39;t get enough on<br/>\ntheir first serving. So whenever I&#39;d ask my son how many scoops of clam<br/>\nchowder did he want on his bowl, or how many meatballs on his spaghetti or<br/>\nwhatever (he loves numbers) you could see he had figured things out when he<br/>\nstarted saying &quot;two scoops, for firsts&quot; emphasizing to himself and the rest<br/>\nof us that he realized he&#39;d be able to get more later, then I&#39;d just scoop<br/>\ntwo scoops as he&#39;d asked and often that would fill him but he might still<br/>\ntest to see if he could get more, and of course he always could.<br/>\nI hope some of this helps. I have to run but feel free to ask more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Apr 23, 2008 at 6:40 AM, Lisa Blocker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlblock01@...\">jlblock01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   Has anyone here had experience with foster children and how to integrate<br/>\n&gt; them into your unschooling/attachment parenting lifestyle?<br/>\n&gt; Just for some background.... we have an 11 yr old boy placed with us<br/>\n&gt; temporarily (supposed to be for a few days we are now at two weeks!) as an<br/>\n&gt; emergency placement. The child has had alot of trauma (crazy mother even<br/>\n&gt; crazier step father who have done everything to prevent contact with very<br/>\n&gt; sane loving father) anyway he has no life skills, no independence, doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know anything about being free etc. He attends school (which is a huge pain<br/>\n&gt; in the ass!) but I just find it frustrating to try to give a child freedom<br/>\n&gt; and independence and he is just completely paralyzed. He doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>\n&gt; make a sandwich(and won&#39;t ask for someone else to make it)... won&#39;t ask for<br/>\n&gt; food if he is hungry ... I have shown him the snack basket which I keep in<br/>\n&gt; sight for any person in my house to help themselves to but he never takes<br/>\n&gt; anything out of there. I have asked him what he likes as far as food and<br/>\n&gt; snacks and he just says &quot;I like pretty much everything&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; have then said &quot;I would like to get something that you particularly like &quot;<br/>\n&gt; and he has no answer. When I prepare a meal and the kids are serving<br/>\n&gt; themselves he always takes an enormous amount... which I let him do without<br/>\n&gt; comment because I don&#39;t think he needs any negatives associated with<br/>\n&gt; independence... he can never eat all he takes and is then embarrassed and<br/>\n&gt; upset. I have started asking him if he would like to serve himself or have<br/>\n&gt; help and we have talked about how sometimes your eyes can be bigger than<br/>\n&gt; your tummy and that if that happens we can put the leftovers away for<br/>\n&gt; another time. He&#39;s just so wary of everyone and everything that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; heartbreaking! I have figured out that he never took a step at home that<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t dictated or instructed by others... but it&#39;s so disheartening to see<br/>\n&gt; a child when they are given freedom, a safe place and peace that they don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; know what to do. I would like him to DO something... act out, get mad, throw<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; fit, seize some freedom, play, dance SOMETHING! I asked him what he liked<br/>\n&gt; to do as far as sports or other activities and everything he told me he had<br/>\n&gt; done and liked his mother pulled him out of after a few months citing it was<br/>\n&gt; too expensive. It just seems he has been trained to expect disappointment<br/>\n&gt; and to just do whatever it takes to not call attention to himself.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I will say that he&#39;s stopped watching our hands and waiting to be hit so I<br/>\n&gt; do count that as some healing... I just really would like to know what to do<br/>\n&gt; to help him take some control of his life. He quite literally has NO life<br/>\n&gt; skills, can&#39;t make a sandwich, a bowl of cereal, doesn&#39;t throw trash away,<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t move from one place to another without being directly told where he<br/>\n&gt; should go, never asks for anything (I found out he had been using a balled<br/>\n&gt; up dirty towel from the bathroom floor for two days instead of taking the<br/>\n&gt; clean towels on the counter I put out for him ) It&#39;s really hard for me<br/>\n&gt; because I am not used to telling a child what to do and how and when to do<br/>\n&gt; it.... consequently I feel like I am neglecting him when I discover things<br/>\n&gt; like the towel or that he was hungry but didn&#39;t take a snack. How do I give<br/>\n&gt; him a safe place and freedom without neglecting him??

Just for some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2102689274\">Has anyone here had experience with foster children and how to integrate them into your unschooling/attachment parenting lifestyle?  <br/>\nJust for some background.... we have an 11 yr old boy placed with us temporarily (supposed to be for a few days we are now at two weeks!)  as an emergency placement.   The child has had alot of trauma (crazy mother even crazier step father who have done everything to prevent contact with very sane loving father)   anyway he has no life skills, no independence, doesn&#39;t know anything about being free etc.   He attends school (which is a huge pain in the ass!)  but I just find it frustrating to try to give a child freedom and independence and he is just completely paralyzed.   He doesn&#39;t know how to  make  a sandwich(and won&#39;t ask for someone else to make it)... won&#39;t ask for food if he is hungry ... I have shown him the snack basket which I keep in sight for any person in my house to help themselves to but he never takes anything out of there.  I have asked him what he likes as far as food and snacks and he just says &quot;I like pretty much everything&quot;   I<br/>\n have then said &quot;I would like to get something that you particularly like &quot;  and he has no answer.    When I prepare a meal and the kids are serving themselves he always takes an enormous amount... which I let him do without comment because I don&#39;t think he needs any negatives associated with independence... he can never eat all he takes and is then embarrassed and upset.   I have started asking him if he would like to serve himself or have help and we have talked about how sometimes your eyes can be bigger than your tummy and that if that happens we can put the leftovers away for another time.  He&#39;s just so wary of everyone and everything that it&#39;s heartbreaking!  I have figured out that he never took a step at home that wasn&#39;t dictated or instructed by others... but it&#39;s so disheartening to see a child when they are given freedom, a safe place and peace that they don&#39;t know what to do.   I would like him to DO something... act out, get mad, throw a<br/>\n fit, seize some freedom, play, dance SOMETHING!    I asked him what he liked to do as far as sports or other activities and everything he told me he had done and liked his mother pulled him out of after a few months citing it was too expensive.   It just seems he has been trained to expect disappointment and to just do whatever it takes to not call attention to himself.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that he&#39;s stopped watching our hands and waiting to be hit so I do count that as some healing... I just really would like to know what to do to help him take some control of his life.   He quite literally has NO life skills, can&#39;t make a sandwich, a bowl of cereal, doesn&#39;t throw trash away, doesn&#39;t move from one place to another without being directly told where he should go, never asks for anything (I found out he had been using a balled up dirty towel from the bathroom floor for two days instead of taking the clean towels on the counter I put out for him )     It&#39;s really hard for me because I am not used to telling a child what to do and how and when to do it.... consequently I feel like I am neglecting him when I discover things like the towel or that he was hungry but didn&#39;t take a snack.     How do I give him a safe place and freedom without neglecting him??  My children just naturally understood freedom ... of course my children had no<br/>\n trauma and have always lived in my home where they are loved and cared for.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I need to take a step back and just change my mindset in that he is not really  11 yrs old emotionally and needs much more help and guidance than I expect normally?   Is there any such thing as &quot;teaching&quot; (boy do I hate that word!) a child how to be free??    He sees my kids doing what they like when they like but he doesn&#39;t seem to equate anything others do with himself.    I want the time he spends here to be a time of healing and transition (mom has lost custody and will probably go to jail)  for when he is able to go home with his dad.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<br/>\nLisa Blocker <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
