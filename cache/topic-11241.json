When researching before buying, we found out that about a year ago EMachines was purchased by Gateway (did you notice the similarity of the desktop pic) so basically we bought a Gateway.  Did you get the $299. deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nShannon Sea <br/>\nMurfreesboro.

Seriously!:)<br/>\nI got an emachine for a great price and it&#39;s worked fabulous. Their<br/>\ntech support was great when we were setting it up and having trouble<br/>\nwith the router. Just get some cheap emachine from Best Buy and that<br/>\nwill save you all a lot of stress I bet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really can&#39;t do that, then consider allowing each person as<br/>\nlong as they want (reminding them that people are waiting) and get the<br/>\nother kids involved in some REALLY fun activity. Pull out clay or<br/>\nplaydough, put on a new movie, pull out some fun little toys or games<br/>\nyou&#39;ve been saving (because you planned ahead and buy little stashes<br/>\nof things for just such a day), bake a pizza, do whatever it takes to<br/>\nengage them so they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to be the full-time working parent. Maybe you could have<br/>\nsome activities set up ahead of time that you know they love, for dh<br/>\nto engage them with? I guess it depends how actively involved he is<br/>\nand how much tolerance he has for mess and such. I work full-time<br/>\nalso, but I&#39;m fortunate to have a dh that gets it now (not in the<br/>\npast) and invites the kids into whatever he is doing. Jalen has been<br/>\nhelping Daddy dig in dirt a lot lately, as Markus landscapes the front<br/>\nyard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, try to get more technology in your home if possible. Find ways<br/>\nto engage everyone if not. And try to give them as much time as they<br/>\nneed on these activities so they feel &quot;full&quot; and not needy.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSPONSORED LINKS Secondary school education Graduate school education Home school education <br/>\nGraduate school education online High school education Chicago school education <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
