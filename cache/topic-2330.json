Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n**I used to feel the same way, and I tried a bunch of things like you<br/>\ndescribed - knitting and pottery and all sorts of others.  Pretty much<br/>\nanything that crossed my path.  I think for me it was part of the process of<br/>\nopening myself up to having a passion.  For a while none of the things I<br/>\ntried held my interest.  But the more things I tried the more I enjoyed<br/>\ntrying things just for the sake of learning even a little bit.  Seeing my<br/>\nkids just jump in and try anything that seemed interesting and dropping it<br/>\nwhen it wasn&#39;t was very helpful for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen jewelry making came along I think I was at just the right place to grab<br/>\non and go with it.  I had learned that there was value for me in dabbling. I<br/>\nhad learned that becoming proficient in something takes time (I don&#39;t think<br/>\nI&#39;ll ever &#39;master&#39; it.  There&#39;s always more to learn, and that&#39;s a huge part<br/>\nof the fun.) and I had learned that I wasn&#39;t interested in putting that time<br/>\ninto just anything.   One day I announced to Jon that I felt ready to find<br/>\n&#39;the&#39; way to express myself, and very shortly thereafter I found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t stop dabbling.  It&#39;s ok if you think scrapbooking is it and then it<br/>\ncollects dust (although in that case I usually hand the supplies over to my<br/>\nkids :0) ).  You won&#39;t find &#39;it&#39; unless you keep that part of yourself open<br/>\nto seeing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and you might enjoy Ren&#39;s creativity e-list.

Following<br/>\nmy dd&#39;s lead has meant honoring what is not just a preference, but a need,<br/>\nfor her, to be home.  I was so antsy at first, feeling like we &quot;should&quot; be<br/>\n&quot;doing&quot; more, that I was depriving her somehow by not &quot;getting her out&quot;<br/>\netcetera.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut after making myself witness HER and turn away from my internal voices,<br/>\nand reassessing, I saw that home IS what she wants, it&#39;s where she feels<br/>\nsafe and comfortable to explore fully.  She has no boredom issues with<br/>\nstaying home all day and night for days on end.  (The only issues are my<br/>\nbalancing my own need to get out and my son&#39;s requests.)  She has an amazing<br/>\nimagination and interest in everything (spent 30 minutes one morning<br/>\npondering the pull cord on the light, how did they MAKE it like that, why<br/>\ndid they make it like that, had so many theories before she even got out of<br/>\nbed it made my head spin).  She gets her exercise on these days by running<br/>\nraces from room to room, jumping, spinning and flipping on the bed for ages<br/>\n(&quot;Mom, come see my tricks on the bed!&quot;)  She has so many interests, it&#39;s<br/>\nhard to keep track of them all (Ancient Egypt, Dinosaurs, the solar system<br/>\nabout which she asks questions that blow me away, any kind of animal<br/>\nespecially lizards right now and bugs, Dragons) and she explores most of<br/>\nthem from home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe times she wants to go out are times that she has a focused purpose.  For<br/>\ninstance, this summer she is determined to learn to swim on her own without<br/>\na vest or arm wings aiding her.  She&#39;d love to have a pool here in our yard<br/>\nso she doesn&#39;t have to go far, but since we don&#39;t she wants to go out a lot<br/>\nof days to find a pool.  What I find interesting is her personality of<br/>\nintensity and focus.  While this is driving her she wants to spend all day,<br/>\nevery day at the pool.  She wakes up in the morning and checks the weather<br/>\nto see if it&#39;s swimming weather.  Before swimming took over, she and her<br/>\nbrother were into the Usborne Young Puzzle books - when I say &quot;into&quot; I mean<br/>\nwe not only read all of them, we lived them.  She made card and other games<br/>\nout of the characters, made costumes from her artcart to wear of the<br/>\ncharacters, painted the characters, drew the characters with pencil, drew<br/>\nthem on the sidewalk with sidewalk chaulk, taped pieces of paper she drew on<br/>\ntogether to make stories about the characters from these books.  Etcetera.<br/>\nWhen the swimming phase ends, she&#39;ll move on to something with equal passion<br/>\nand intensity.  I love that about her, and I&#39;ve come to see how home is her<br/>\nsafe base where she springs off from, regroups, and decides on the things<br/>\nthat move her out into the world at her own pace and due to her own<br/>\ninterests (unless we are compromising to get her brother and/or me out!).<br/>\n<br/>\nToday is rainy here so we&#39;re home instead of heading to a pool.  We spent<br/>\nthe morning creating and performing rescues for my kids&#39; spider man rescue<br/>\nheroes.  Now they&#39;re watching Scooby Doo.  Little Bear plus my son&#39;s new<br/>\nfavorites, &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; on video and Dora&#39;s &quot;Pirate Adventure&quot; will<br/>\nlikely get asked for today also.  I&#39;d be surprised if they don&#39;t want to<br/>\nre-read two Usborne Young Puzzle Adventure books we got from the library the<br/>\nother day and who knows where that will lead to.  DD and her brother and<br/>\ncousin turned the last few books into a &quot;play&quot; on the bed, so maybe I&#39;ll be<br/>\ntreated to a performance.  We&#39;ll be trying to glue dd&#39;s piggy bank which she<br/>\ninadvertantly dropped yesterday back together.  And dd&#39;s been on a painting<br/>\nspree lately and declared it one of her favorite things right now ... her<br/>\ncousin was here yesterday and lost her first tooth here at our house (didn&#39;t<br/>\nknow they could come out so early, she&#39;s just turning 5!) and dd painted her<br/>\na picture of Daphne from Scooby to celebrate her tooth coming out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, we spend the vast majority of our days like this at home, but<br/>\nI&#39;d hardly call them &quot;down&quot;.

Lots of down <br/>\ntimes in southern Louisiana - it&#39;s just too hot to do anything else. <br/>\nIf we had too many days in a row where things had to be done away <br/>\nfrom home, Laurie would get grumpy and I&#39;d postpone anything else <br/>\nthat week. <br/>\n<br/>\nDown days at home are when Laurie learned best in her own way.

Even going out to eat is too much of a production for her. She <br/>\nwants to be home with no commitments and no plans.

The idea that merely beginning some project<br/>\nautomatically mandates completion of it is probably a leftover schoolthink.<br/>\nThat is when kids have so little time for their own stuff, what with<br/>\nhomework and essays and required reading, that none can afford to be wasted<br/>\non things that are simply experimental forays into possible future<br/>\ninterests. It doesn&#39;t have to still apply to us or our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing though: if you genuinely suspect that you won&#39;t get back into any<br/>\nof these crafty type things, tossing (or donating) the materials - what is<br/>\nactually nothing but clutter - will free you from the guilt of having them<br/>\n&quot;hanging over you&quot;. Believe me, I have found getting it out of the house is<br/>\nthe best way to get it out of mind also. BTW &quot;donating&quot; can also apply to<br/>\ngiving the items to the kids for some other creative use.<br/>\n<br/>\nVegging out in front of the tv, or the crossword, or the light romance<br/>\nnovel, or the garden bed full of weeds, or laps in the swimming pool, or the<br/>\ncomputer Solitaire, in some ways is like taking a nap and sometimes a<br/>\nmeditation. The conscious mind is at most lightly engaged and the emotions<br/>\nalso get a chance to relax. Maybe the subconscious is doing some processing.<br/>\nIf you read Jane Austen, you may start feeling that it is imperative to have<br/>\nbusy hands, like crocheting or knitting or quilting or mending while<br/>\nrelaxing. I say only if you really do enjoy those activities or really need<br/>\nthe mending done. Nor is this veg-out time necessarily the time that you<br/>\nwould be putting towards your passion-hobby in a fully emotionally and<br/>\nintellectually engaged way, especially if you are physically tired. Chances<br/>\nare you would still want to have periods of doing nothing (some call it<br/>\nconsolidation) in between periods of busy activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that just before a baby is due is the time when those of us<br/>\nwith hobbies we love necessarily discovered them. Personally I spent a good<br/>\ndeal of that time, when not reading child care and birthing books,<br/>\ncontemplating my navel, and reveling the excuse to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing out onto a limb, as usual, I want to suggest to you that this<br/>\nconcentrating on the &quot;shoulds&quot; is part of a pattern you have shown us of<br/>\nbeing really hard on yourself, and focusing on the negative - the not-done,<br/>\nthe mistake, the running mental litany of criticism installed by a parent or<br/>\nsome other authority figure. If you did have some immense enduring interest,<br/>\nthe danger would be that you would then feel guilty that it was being set<br/>\naside while you cared for your new baby and dd.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the startling joys of Unschooling, is that we can give ourselves the<br/>\nsame freedom to enjoy life that we are so rigorously ensuring for our<br/>\nchildren. It works in both directions - treating children with equal respect<br/>\nfor their capabilities, emotions and interests as we would treat another<br/>\nbeloved adult; and treating other adults and ourselves with the same freedom<br/>\nto experiment, be playful, acknowledging our right to sometimes *appear*<br/>\nunproductive, and explore diverse interests without needing to declare a<br/>\nlifetime commitment to any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n**I used to feel the same way, and I tried a bunch of things like you<br/>\ndescribed - knitting and pottery and all sorts of others.  Pretty much<br/>\nanything that crossed my path.  I think for me it was part of the process of<br/>\nopening myself up to having a passion.  For a while none of the things I<br/>\ntried held my interest.  But the more things I tried the more I enjoyed<br/>\ntrying things just for the sake of learning even a little bit.  Seeing my<br/>\nkids just jump in and try anything that seemed interesting and dropping it<br/>\nwhen it wasn&#39;t was very helpful for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen jewelry making came along I think I was at just the right place to grab<br/>\non and go with it.  I had learned that there was value for me in dabbling. I<br/>\nhad learned that becoming proficient in something takes time (I don&#39;t think<br/>\nI&#39;ll ever &#39;master&#39; it.  There&#39;s always more to learn, and that&#39;s a huge part<br/>\nof the fun.) and I had learned that I wasn&#39;t interested in putting that time<br/>\ninto just anything.   One day I announced to Jon that I felt ready to find<br/>\n&#39;the&#39; way to express myself, and very shortly thereafter I found it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t stop dabbling.  It&#39;s ok if you think scrapbooking is it and then it<br/>\ncollects dust (although in that case I usually hand the supplies over to my<br/>\nkids :0) ).  You won&#39;t find &#39;it&#39; unless you keep that part of yourself open<br/>\nto seeing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and you might enjoy Ren&#39;s creativity e-list.

When we got home from the circus, it was 9pm, which is usually the<br/>\ntime I try to get her into bed, but decided that I was just too beat and my<br/>\nfeet were too swollen to make the effort to do bedtime, so told her she<br/>\ncould stay up until I went to sleep too. So she was up later and slept in a<br/>\nbit and then today I just felt like I was getting an ear infection and that<br/>\nmight explain how tired I have been. So we had a lazy morning, then went out<br/>\nfor a few groceries and when we came home I set her up with pollypocket.com<br/>\nagain while I had a lay down and then she watched TV. Later in the afternoon<br/>\nI went out to pick peas for supper, she happily came with me not at my<br/>\nsuggestion, I just said I was going and she wanted to come. Then I went out<br/>\nand sat on the deck and she came out and wanted to skip rope. Well her idea<br/>\nof rope skipping has been for me to spin in and her to jump *near* it not in<br/>\nit:-)  So today I said how about we learn how properly and so she said yes<br/>\nand we spent a really happy time with her jumping rope. Slowly for sure but<br/>\nwhenever I said jump she did and she is now getting it. We laughed and had<br/>\nfun.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow she is helping her dad make supper (I asked him to cause I was so tired<br/>\nso I am doing email - see I am learning) and again, no fights, no stress<br/>\njust a wonderful loving day. I am liking this! The days are peaceful. I had<br/>\nmoments of guilt this afternoon while I rested, but I shooed them away<br/>\neventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal issue now is that if I am home, I find I am bored easily. I tend<br/>\nto fall into the trap of vegging in front of the TV instead of doing most<br/>\nanything else, except computer. I hear about when you are all at home you<br/>\nare doing crafts or reading or gardening or some other fantastic hobby or<br/>\ninterest you have and I can&#39;t seem to get up the gumption to do it. It is<br/>\nlike, if I am at home it is total down time otherwise we are out doing,<br/>\nthere is no happy medium. I think this might come from my restaurant<br/>\nmanagement days, when I was out working or partying, and then eventually<br/>\ncame home to recoup. But those days are gone and I don&#39;t seem to be able to<br/>\nfigure out how to change the pattern. I have plenty of interests, lots of<br/>\nthings I would like to know or know how to do but seem to be unable to take<br/>\nthe interest to any sort of completion. I thought I wanted to do scrap<br/>\nbooking, so took a course and got all the supplies and did one page and<br/>\nthere it sits. Thought I wanted to knit and took a course and got the<br/>\nsupplies and there it sits. This is not a new thing for me, I have lots of<br/>\ninterests, but get stalled in the learning stage, want to go straight to<br/>\nmastery I think.
