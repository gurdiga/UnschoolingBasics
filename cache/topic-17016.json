I know <br/>\nfor my DS, even if he&#39;s had 85 apples and a dozen tortillas, if he&#39;s <br/>\nhad no protein, he&#39;s still &quot;hungry&quot; in his body for that protein. <br/>\nEspecially if he&#39;s going through a growing time mentally or <br/>\nphsically. And, too, your DS may have eaten a bunch, but he was also <br/>\nexpending lots of energy at the same time. &quot;tired&quot; is not just a <br/>\nphysical thing sometimes - sometimes it&#39;s an accumulation of inputs <br/>\nover the day. I know sometimes I&#39;m physically rested but my brain is <br/>\ntired from lots of thinking and planning and absorbing and talking <br/>\nand all like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe sit down and talk together about what would help next time <br/>\n(debrief the situation with him) - more frequent checking in <br/>\nto &#39;remind&#39; him that he needs a bit of protein or a rest break or <br/>\nsomething. I&#39;ll use water breaks for that with DS if we&#39;re someplace <br/>\nwhere there&#39;s lots going on and he&#39;s on the move a bunch. I&#39;ll <br/>\nsuggest he stop for a drink of water to stay hydrated (which is <br/>\nanother issue, if he starts dehydrating he&#39;s more likely to fall <br/>\napart too). 2 minutes for a drink of water and he&#39;s hydrated a bit, <br/>\nhe gets to pause and regroup, and often that little  pause in the <br/>\naction alerts him to a need for food, bathroom break, or whatever, <br/>\nthat, if he just kept going he might miss the signals for until it <br/>\nbecame a critical issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle Leifur Reid","from":"&quot;Michelle Leifur Reid&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] It doesn&#39;t work! ... and then it does ::whew::","postDate":"1157673345","msgId":17131,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MDcxNjU1djM0YTE5NDRhczQwN2NkMDBhMzhjYTM2NmVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDYwOTAxMDc0Mnk2NjE5OTI4ZWtkZGE5ZDE0ZjBlOGU2NDAwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDYwOTAxMDc0Mnk2NjE5OTI4ZWtkZGE5ZDE0ZjBlOGU2NDAwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17130,"nextInTopic":17136,"prevInTime":17130,"nextInTime":17132,"topicId":17016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I never saw it come through<br/>\noriginally and only noticed it when Tyra posted her response.  Perhaps last<br/>\nweek wasn&#39;t a &quot;normal&quot; day.  Maybe last week he was tired from less sleep,<br/>\nactive play, not enough active play, etc.  And wat was he snacking on?<br/>\nPerhaps he had plenty of carbs (I&#39;m thinking lots of fruits and veggies) but<br/>\nnot enough protein?  Perhaps pack some nuts for the trip over or some cheese<br/>\nor something else with protein.  So he may have been honest.  He may have<br/>\nbeen tired and hungry for something he hadn&#39;t had yet.  Since he has done<br/>\nthis bounce house in the past without problems, I would chalk it up to an<br/>\noff day.  He&#39;s still SO little and still needs SO much from us.  Is there<br/>\nanyway that the bounce house could be something he does in the middle of<br/>\nyour shopping rather than the end or even at the beginning.  &quot;Let&#39;s go do<br/>\nthe bounce house and then we can do our shopping&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s take a break<br/>\nfrom shopping and do the bounce house.  We can finish up our shopping when<br/>\nyou are done.&quot; Seems like the bounce house equals time to go and he is<br/>\nhaving a hard time disconnecting from something so fun for a boring car<br/>\ntrip.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also would consider a better way of dealing with &quot;aftermath&quot; than<br/>\nexpressing disappointment in his actions.  Telling a child that you are<br/>\ndisappointed in them and can&#39;t trust them is just so negative.  While you<br/>\nmay be disappointed (or perhaps embarassed?) about the situation, think of<br/>\nbetter ways to talk about it than *your* feelings. What about *his*<br/>\nfeelings?  Maybe something like, &quot;You sure seemed to be having fun today.<br/>\nIt must have seemed like time really flew and you weren&#39;t ready to leave<br/>\nwhen the man said it was time.  It would be fun if we could just bound in<br/>\nthat house all day wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this week went better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nMichelle Leifur Reid<br/>\nYOUR Pampered Chef Consultant<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nCheck out my homeschool cooking classes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183015595,"authorName":"Tyra Olufemi","from":"Tyra Olufemi &lt;motherspirit@...&gt;","profile":"breastisbesttn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] It doesn&#39;t work! ... and then it does ::whew::","postDate":"1157671673","msgId":17130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwOTA3MjMyNzUzLlVEUVMyNDY5MC5pYm01OWFlYy5iZWxsc291dGgubmV0QG1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":17016,"nextInTopic":17131,"prevInTime":17129,"nextInTime":17131,"topicId":17016,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Peace Laureen!

I wanted to say that I feel that it was just that day with your son.  Age 4 tended to be an easier stage for me and my older son however, he still had his moments.  As a matter of fact, I remember there were times when his energy was so intense that he would literally fall on the ground and kick and scream when he had not done that since the twos.  I say just go with the flow.  I feel confident that he will move past these types of reactions.  Continuing with your response will probably provide him with continuity in knowing that you are still committed to peaceful parenting.  I never feel that peaceful parenting will render the exact results that I think it should.

Rowan, who is four, is a totally<br/>\ninvolved part of this.... helps me clean out the fridge, we talk about<br/>\nmeals, he helps pick out produce when we get there (and chows down on<br/>\nthe samples), and helps pay for things... it&#39;s a great time. When<br/>\nwe&#39;re done with the shopping, there&#39;s a bounce house set up, and he<br/>\ngets to go rampage around in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter the difficulty. Bounce house is a ticketed, time-limited event.<br/>\nHe&#39;s always understood this, and when the people running it say &quot;time<br/>\nto come out!&quot;, he&#39;s always done great.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot yesterday. Yesterday, he screamed, he railed, he totally flipped<br/>\nout, and when I tried to talk him down, with explaining the sitch,<br/>\nstatements of understanding, etc, I got &quot;No! Never!&quot;, and he hid on<br/>\ntop of the slide inside. Eventually, with the guy running the thing<br/>\ngetting more and more upset, I went in and pulled him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEeeeesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe walked back to the car, Rowan sobbing like a hysterical broken<br/>\nthing the whole way. Got him buckled in, gave him some water and some<br/>\ntime to calm down, I expressed how disappointed I was, that I had<br/>\nthought he understood that 1) we&#39;d spent all our money, 2) that it was<br/>\ntime for the really small kids to have their turn, that 3) we were all<br/>\nhungry and needed to go home to eat, and 4) that by doing what he did,<br/>\nhe&#39;d made it tough for us to trust him going in the bounce house<br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone was quiet for about three minutes. Then Rowan pipes up from<br/>\nthe back seat, &quot;I think that I was tired, and I was hungry, and I<br/>\nthink I need to go home and eat and go to bed, and we&#39;ll try again<br/>\nsome other time. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWoah. How incredibly cool is that?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I need is ideas for how to handle this in the future. Going<br/>\nin there after him was disrespectful, but hollering at him from<br/>\noutside would have been too. He&#39;d had snacks before we left, and had<br/>\nbeen chowing down on samples, so &quot;hungry&quot; wasn&#39;t all that much a<br/>\nfactor, I don&#39;t think. Tired, maybe, but I can&#39;t move the time of the<br/>\nfarmer&#39;s market (we were there around 5 pm), and besides, that&#39;s<br/>\nnormal playtime for him anyway. I&#39;ve explained how things work there,<br/>\nand it&#39;s never been an issue like yesterday. So I guess my toolbox is<br/>\ntotally empty, since being patient, rational, and honest has always<br/>\nserved just fine in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts? Help?
