I know I didn&#39;t have any homework other than have my mom help me with<br/>\nspelling words before fourth grade and then it was ONE subject a night.  I<br/>\nremember this so clearly.  Monday was Math.  Tuesday was Social Studies.<br/>\nWednesday was Reading.  Thursday was Spelling.  It wasn&#39;t until middle<br/>\nschool that we would have multiple subjects of homework each night but even<br/>\nthen it was usually only as much as could be completed in about an hour<br/>\ncombined!  High school is when I remember having several hours of homework a<br/>\nnight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd guess what?  Standardized tests have shown that students are not getting<br/>\nsmarter by doing excess homework!  It&#39;s my firm opinion that if you can&#39;t<br/>\nteach a child in 36-40 hours a week in something then doing it at home is<br/>\nNOT going to help.  I remember clearly that the work that I was assigned<br/>\nthat I understood I could crank out in 10-15 minutes, but if I didn&#39;t<br/>\nunderstand it before I went home I still didn&#39;t understand it.  My dad did a<br/>\nlot of helping me understand things that I just wasn&#39;t getting at school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAS far as your daughter wanting to go to school to get away from her brother<br/>\nI can only say that she is going to find undesirable children at school as<br/>\nwell and the other stresses that accompany going to school are going to<br/>\noutweigh her being away from her brother.  She probably can&#39;t comprehend<br/>\nweighing the two because they are sort of abstract in their comparisons at<br/>\nthat age.  Maybe you could write up the pros and cons on a sheet of paper<br/>\nand show her visually why staying home might better be in her interest.<br/>\nPros to going to school:  Being away from her brother.  Having homework.<br/>\nCons:  Being around other children who may be miserable to be around.  Not<br/>\ngetting to do fun things during school.  Excess homework.  Having to go to<br/>\nschool everyday even if you are tired.  Rules of school.  Limited free<br/>\ntime.  School food (if she were to eat in the cafeteria - at least my kids<br/>\nalways found it gross.)  etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11810,"nextTopicId":11982}}
