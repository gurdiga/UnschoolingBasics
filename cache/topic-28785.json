And we have a little &#39;resource room&#39; of officially educational stuff (our craft supplies are in there too) which we haven&#39;t touxched in years but now I see I have thought they were somehow too valuable-looking to throw out.

Thanks for that last comment to &quot;burn everything &#39;educational&#39; in our home!!
