He also left his self<br/>\ndirected learning very happy and most likely he&#39;ll come back for more! <br/>\n <br/>\nAll these conversations got me thinking about the math issue, too.<br/>\nWe live on a small farm so calculating fencing, depth of wells, birth<br/>\nof livestock happen all the time.

Making your choices based on fear<br/>\nis, in my opinion, never the way to go.  I find that joy based decisions<br/>\nalways point me in the best direction!  If I&#39;m making a choice based on my<br/>\nfear of something, I&#39;m starting to really stop and think carefully about<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m doing, and what the joy based choice would be.  I always go with<br/>\nthat one!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d also like to share with you something that I talk about often with other<br/>\nhomeschoolers in my local group who are concerned about grade level<br/>\nexpectations and performance.  I grew up moving around the country every few<br/>\nyears, constantly changing schools (not a military brat, an amusement park<br/>\nbrat!).  Every single school had a different curriculum and standards than<br/>\nthe previous one.  I was always either sitting around bored for 6 months<br/>\nbecause I&#39;d already learned everything we were doing, or doing extra<br/>\nhomework, getting up to speed with where the class was.  It was never a big<br/>\ndeal either way, honestly.  In fact, in all my years of changing schools,<br/>\nthe academic parts don&#39;t stand out much in my memory.  It was the challenge<br/>\nof creating new friendships, figuring out the new social order, the new<br/>\nslang terms (Texas was fun, figuring out what &quot;fixin&#39;&quot; meant as a verb!).  I<br/>\nalways did just fine academically.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps to ease your anxiety just a bit. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShell<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nPosted by: &quot;lschroeder106z&quot; lschroeder106z@<br/>\n&lt;mailto:lschroeder106z%40msn.com&gt; msn.com lschroeder106z <br/>\nWed Jan 16, 2008 3:21 pm (PST) <br/>\nAs a cancer survivor and primary homeschooling parent a question <br/>\narrised when I consider Unschooling.

The idea of them remembering me as the taskmaster, the teacher and not as the nurturer, the mother, that would haunt me far more than the idea of them having to go to school and play a little catch up. Although in my situation David would have to die to, he wouldn&#39;t send them to school. I think he would hold them so close to keep himself from flying apart. I know it is what I would do if he died. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you get life insurance that would help your husband to stay home with the kids for a while if you did die? If it is your own mortality that is keeping you from unschooling, you should try and address those fears. I don&#39;t think that Simon and Linnaea would do so badly in school academically. I think they would have a hard time dealing with the bullying and the structure much more than they would struggle with the academics. I don&#39;t know that they are academically gifted, but thinking is something they both do well, sitting down at someone else&#39;s behest, not so good. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n==========<br/>\nAs a cancer survivor and primary homeschooling parent a question <br/>\narrised when I consider Unschooling.
