I sometimes think that I broke my daughters heart<br/>\nand she is just starting to forgive me.  We have a family bed, (I should say<br/>\nmattresses lined up on the floor), now and no one is or ever will be<br/>\nexcluded.  She&#39;s finally, and she&#39;s 11, becoming more comfortable with sleep<br/>\nissues.  I can&#39;t look back at her very young childhood and feel good about<br/>\nanything I put her through, and when I ask myself why all I get for an<br/>\nanswer is that it was all out of my own selfishness.  My butt is black and<br/>\nblue from kicking myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnMarie<br/>\n************************<br/>\nOh, honey, just stop.<br/>\nI have regrets. I wish once we&#39;d finally decided to pull Julian out of school <br/>\nwe did it immediately rather than waiting until the end of the school year. <br/>\nThere are dozens more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am absolutely certain you&#39;ve done wonderful things with your daughter since <br/>\nbirth, and that they are all part of her. She&#39;s not that old now, and she can <br/>\nhave a wonderful childhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you won&#39;t be perfect. I&#39;m not. I mess up all the time. I will again. But <br/>\nI apologize and we move on. Parenting is a relationship, and relationships are <br/>\nmessy.  Sometimes we&#39;re jerks, sometimes our kids are jerks. It&#39;s life, it&#39;s <br/>\nmessy, and so cool and wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe gentle with yourself too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCome to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference August 27-29 in Peabody, MA!<br/>\nFor more information, go to www.LiveandLearnConference.org<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1215,"nextTopicId":1666}}
