It&#39;s biological  <br/>\ninstinct to want to feel competent. The schooled, conventionally  <br/>\nparented kids have an additional layer on top of that, like the  <br/>\nparent voices that keep reminding them they aren&#39;t competent (to make  <br/>\nchoices, to do what the parents think they should and so on.) When  <br/>\nyou&#39;re digging this deep for answers, I think control is too vague a  <br/>\nterm. Control could be a shackle or a cage that operates even when  <br/>\nthe parent is gone. For kids, control is very often about a parent in  <br/>\neffect saying a child isn&#39;t competent to make the right decisions so  <br/>\nthe parent needs to decide for the child. And that grates against the  <br/>\ndrive to feel competent and test one&#39;s own always-changing limitations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you tell a child, &quot;No, you can&#39;t jump off the slide, that&#39;s too  <br/>\nhigh,&quot; I don&#39;t think a child feels chained down. They feel -- and I&#39;m  <br/>\nprojecting from my own feelings as a child and my reactions as an  <br/>\nadult -- &quot;How do you know? I need to test that out and see. Maybe I  <br/>\ncan.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(A good unschooling approach would be, if you know your child isn&#39;t a  <br/>\ngreat jumper, to start off with some jumps that aren&#39;t quite as high  <br/>\nand work up to it. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so they enjoy reading about children acting independently<br/>\n&gt; without parents around.... its about independence from the need of<br/>\n&gt; parental help?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, I think it&#39;s need for competence and a movement toward  <br/>\nindependence rather than a fight against something in their way. It&#39;s  <br/>\nbiological.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you might be looking too much from the parents&#39; point of  <br/>\nview. All the work we as parents do is pretty much in the background  <br/>\nas far as young kids are concerned. We&#39;re providing what they expect  <br/>\nand need so they&#39;re not really consciously aware of 90% of what we  <br/>\ndo. (And when they do it&#39;s a momentary thing.) The time they most  <br/>\nnotice us is when we&#39;re in their way or not there when they need us ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we&#39;re attuned to them, we&#39;re providing the amount of help they  <br/>\nneed so it&#39;s not going to be a &quot;too much!&quot; or &quot;too little!&quot; alarm on  <br/>\ntheir radar. Sort of like when the furnace is working. It&#39;s not that  <br/>\nwe don&#39;t appreciate it. It&#39;s that we are hyper aware when it&#39;s not  <br/>\nshutting off or not coming on when it should ;-) (Of course there are  <br/>\nalways some kids whose drive exceeds their ability so it&#39;s not a  <br/>\nblanket statement.
