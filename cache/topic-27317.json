The better the <br/>\nvocabulary, the better the grammar, the better the comprehension.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeaving a child is a sterile room and only speaking through a hole in <br/>\nthe wall in &quot;baby talk&quot; and really bad grammar will not have the same <br/>\n&quot;results&quot; as taking him to interesting places and meeting lots of <br/>\nchatty people and watching movies with subtitles and rhyming and <br/>\nplaying words games and speaking with silly accents and talking about <br/>\nwhy things sound/mean certain ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not about &quot;teaching&quot; English---it&#39;s about USING it. Playing with <br/>\nit. Engaging in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn school, children are &quot;taught&quot; foreign languages the same way <br/>\nteachers &quot;teach&quot; everything else: sterile and with no context. *You* <br/>\nmay have been taught a foreign language that way! How much do you <br/>\nremember?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo any of you actually speak and understand a second language? How did <br/>\nyou learn *that*? With lectures and textbooks and worksheets and <br/>\nquizzes?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to learn a second language is the same way you learned the <br/>\nfirst! By being surrounded by others who speak that language. By asking <br/>\nsimple questions and having them answered in that language. By starting <br/>\nwith small, simple nouns (juice, cookie, store,...beer &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>\ngradually adding verbs (drink, go, want, find, look) and then adding <br/>\nadverbs and adjectives. Slowly making full sentences that make more and <br/>\nmore sense. Hearing different words in different contexts and making <br/>\nthose connections. Making mistakes and learning from them with no major <br/>\nsetbacks or embarassments because your &quot;guide&quot; was right there helping <br/>\nyou navigate the language.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling works the same way. It&#39;s not about&quot; teaching&quot; things out of <br/>\ncontext because he *might* need them some day or about dropping a ten <br/>\nyear old in Rome, Italy and saying, &quot;Go learn Italian!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about BEing with him and helping him find his way. About being <br/>\nWITH him and helping him navigate the world.
