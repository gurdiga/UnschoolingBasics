They want to gather with those who understand them. They want to share how hard this is with those who are on the journey too. They want to connect. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they assume -- from the list name, from their own desperation -- that this place offers what they need. They don&#39;t *want* it to be anything else. They want and need welcome. But what they get is the list doing what it promises to do: help people who want to change to examine deeply what&#39;s getting in their way and help them understand what will work better and why. Which gets perceived as criticism and attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to see this list as NOT a public gathering place where beginning unschoolers connect with each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will help to see it as a private home. A home owned by Meredith Novak, Kelly Lovejoy and Ren Allen. They&#39;ve created a space to offer the type of analytical help *they* found so helpful as beginning unschoolers. They&#39;ve opened the doors for anyone who would like to get that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect if anyone&#39;s kids mistook a gathering at someone&#39;s home for a birthday party and the child got upset when handed Legos rather than birthday cake that no one would support the child in reprimanding the hostess for not being a birthday party. <br/>\n<br/>\nI truly wish the purpose of the list were as easy to grasp as &quot;Lego club&quot;. I wish when we point out that they&#39;ve mistaken this place as something it isn&#39;t that it was as easy to grasp as &quot;I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t have birthday cake. All we have here is Legos.&quot; But when we hand them Legos, we&#39;re called mean. When we try to help them understand the list isn&#39;t a birthday party, we&#39;re called mean. And then they start railing about how birthday parties are what everyone wants and why can&#39;t we be the the birthday party they want us to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: How this list works","postDate":"1361279460","msgId":49614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtmdnRsNCs5ajhwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA1YzcwMWNlMGU0NiRmY2VhYTllMCRmNmJmZmRhMCRAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":49610,"nextInTopic":49619,"prevInTime":49613,"nextInTime":49615,"topicId":49551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So lists like this one split off so the messages could be focused on helping those who were ready to change. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like holding an AA meeting at a busy bar.

It&#39;s that it works best for certain learning types, for those who like to dissect ideas to see inside. That type might not be you. Or you might get more from just reading. Or maybe you&#39;ll find a list that focuses on support. Or maybe you&#39;ll get something from both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So, yes an online supportive community would be nice to find.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>State lists *might* offer what you need. The focus there might be on helping people connect with each other rather than discussing how to unschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has a good list:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/world\">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>\n<br/>\n(Scroll down to the bottom.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is the Radical Unschoolers Network:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com\">http://familyrun.ning.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Forums are much like this list. But the Groups are more about social networking I believe. Some may be more active than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with keeping support lists lively is that people have a greater need -- read that as a willingness to set aside time for it -- to receive support than they do to give it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn this list, people are *passionate* about explaining unschooling. Figuring out new ways to explain unschooling is itself rewarding. :-) It&#39;s well worth taking time from the day to do. Often that just isn&#39;t true of support lists. Answering questions is interesting, but giving support can be more draining than rewarding. So people take less time to offer it. The list gets less busy and they grow quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope you find a support list. IT&#39;s just been my experience that they start strong because there&#39;s a great need, but they die out because the people willing to write don&#39;t find it passionately engaging.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] How this list works","postDate":"1361215347","msgId":49585,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzRUQyQkVCLUYzMDAtNEQwRC1CNEQ3LUI1RTRDQ0Y0NDgyREB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFFMjg2Q0Q2LUU4OUUtNEY0RC05NjJELTY3REQ5ODE4OTkyM0BnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEFFMjg2Q0Q2LUU4OUUtNEY0RC05NjJELTY3REQ5ODE4OTkyM0BnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49584,"nextInTopic":49587,"prevInTime":49584,"nextInTime":49586,"topicId":49551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It helps me to think of it this way - <br/>\npretend this is a list for people seeking to live meat free to get vegetarian <br/>\ninformation and help in moving away from meat.  If you come on and say, &quot;I am a <br/>\nvegetarian for the most part, but I want to eat bacon. What should I do?&quot; Some <br/>\npeople might say, &quot;Have you tried soy bacon? Have you tried meeting your desire <br/>\nfor salty breakfast foods in another way? Here is a vegetarian recipe for <br/>\nbreakfast food. Etc.&quot;  That would HELP you move toward vegetarianism.  If people <br/>\ncame on and said, &quot;I know - it&#39;s so hard to stay away from bacon!  What I&#39;ve <br/>\nfound helpful is to just eat bacon on the weekends. . .&quot; or &quot;you can be a <br/>\nvegetarian and still eat bacon. . .&quot; That might make you feel better about your <br/>\nlove for bacon, but it wouldn&#39;t help you be a vegetarian.  This list will <br/>\n&quot;support&quot; your move toward radical unschooling, but it will not &quot;support&quot; you by <br/>\ntelling you that it&#39;s ok no matter what you do.  Support in that vein would not <br/>\nhelp you to move toward vegetarianism, it would tell you it&#39;s ok to eat meat. <br/>\n(As a side note, I&#39;m not a vegetarian, but this analgy works for me). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first came to this list, I was moving toward radical unschooling, but I <br/>\nwasn&#39;t there.  Everytime I read a post about bedtimes, for example, I thought, <br/>\n&quot;Sure, that&#39;s fine for them, but we need bedtimes because. . .&quot; And, I wanted <br/>\nposts to acknowledge that I was doing the right thing for my kids by keeping a <br/>\nbedtime.  But, the posts didn&#39;t say that.  They said that my relationship with <br/>\nmy kids would improve by my letting go of that requirement.  They said my kids <br/>\nwould leI hated hearing that because I want to believe that I&#39;m a good mom.  I <br/>\nfeel bad when I hear that I&#39;m doing something that is damaging to my kids.  But, <br/>\nI need to hear it sometimes.  Initially, I would dismiss the thoughts of Joyce, <br/>\nSandra, Meredith, etc. because they made me feel bad about myself.  I wanted <br/>\nthem say something that would make me feel better.  But, once I got through that <br/>\nand started to watch my kids more with what they&#39;d said in mind, I would realize <br/>\nthey were right.  And, it changed me.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the experienced folks on the list had told me that I was ok the way I was, I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have changed.  This list is to help those who want to change to <br/>\nchange.  It isn&#39;t to help those of us who want to feel better about the way <br/>\nwe&#39;re already doing things to feel better.  I think a lot of times we *think* we <br/>\nwant to change when in fact we are afraid to own up to the mistakes we&#39;re making <br/>\nand make changes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547850347,"authorName":"mgroom85","from":"&quot;mgroom85&quot; &lt;meghorvath85@...&gt;","profile":"mgroom85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: How this list works","postDate":"1361212414","msgId":49580,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtmdHM1dStpNGd1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGtmdG5xNytrcGIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49576,"nextInTopic":49581,"prevInTime":49579,"nextInTime":49581,"topicId":49551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Michele - I feel like I can help you out in understanding, I myself being somewhat newish to this group...

But since you didn&#39;t get how the list works from that writing, it obviously wasn&#39;t effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of how this list works is *SO* *SO* difficult to explain in words -- especially when someone is locked into the idea that groups must be for support (without being aware of it) -- that I keep challenging myself to make it clearer.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce people get it, they understand. But I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve once seen someone get how the list works from the explanations people have written over the 17+ years I&#39;ve been participating in such analysis groups.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am familiar with &quot;questioning the things that I already know&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something people choose to do. Then they might read ideas that challenge them. If they don&#39;t like the ideas, it&#39;s best to skip them. No one&#39;s forcing you to question what you know. People here are, though, using the posted ideas to *offer* the challenge to others who are reading. (But no one&#39;s making them read either!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another confusing thing about this list. Answers are directed at everyone reading not solely at the original poster. So what you aren&#39;t familiar with is using posted ideas as a jumping off point for analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe analysis is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. Some people prefer social give and take. But this list is built around providing analysis for those who do like it. Some people who don&#39;t like having their own ideas analyzed sometimes like to read analysis of other people&#39;s ideas. And some people find the whole process uncomfortable. If someone prefers Chinese, they don&#39;t go to a pizza parlor. And they especially don&#39;t get angry at the pizza place owners for not serving Chinese!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not, however interested in anger that goes along with the answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It helps hugely on lists like this to read with the gentle tone of your best friend offering ideas. If you read anger, it was what you added in your head. My writing tends to be very analytical. I&#39;m an engineer. Some people like it. Some don&#39;t. I suspect you&#39;re reading criticism into the analysis and projecting anger onto it as because in social groups no one would tear apart someone else&#39;s ideas unless they were angry. But none of that is true. I&#39;m just analyzing which is how this list works. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s valuable about the list is many people writing in different ways about the same ideas of how to live life AND grow relationships and support exploration. If someone doesn&#39;t like one person&#39;s voice, there&#39;s a half dozen or a dozen people saying the same thing but with different styles.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m all for alternative living and getting answers, but would prefer to see real answers, not just angry opinions, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is list isn&#39;t for alternative living. It&#39;s very specifically about putting relationships and learning first then fitting the rest of life around it. Alternative living folks can find ideas here that will work for them, but not all ideas will be useful for their own particular goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *am*, though, seeing anger in response to my analysis. I wasn&#39;t angry when I wrote it. (I&#39;m still not.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I can&#39;t be part of a group that uses hate when parents are searching for honest answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I honestly don&#39;t see hate. I didn&#39;t call anyone ornery or hateful. I may have said an idea from a child&#39;s perspective is hurtful. The hurt a child receives from his mother is MUCH deeper and more damaging than what a stranger can point out that a mom might be doing. If you felt hurt by the analysis from a perfect stranger, imagine how deep the hurt might be of your child who trusts you to be the one who puts him first? And if you&#39;re certain it doesn&#39;t apply to you, then politely be aware that it may have helped some other mother be kinder to her child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; There is a way to be honest, helpful, AND kind.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Then offer that :-) But be aware that if what you&#39;re offering isn&#39;t putting relationships and exploring freely first, it will be pulled out and held up for analysis. It&#39;s what the list promises to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":260690557,"authorName":"Amber Ripoll","from":"Amber Ripoll &lt;ambersrose@...&gt;","profile":"outofrange78","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: How this list works","postDate":"1361197263","msgId":49560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBRE1Fd2JmQ3ZxakJrUGNqZ3ZENWhVdTdXMDBvTWhRQ29rNG5xaHY5TzZzcWRnLXdVUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtmdDluciszN2xwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDJFMjQzRkI4LTZDOEUtNDExQy04RERCLTREODZGQ0VBNzJDOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4JPGtmdDluciszN2xwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49559,"nextInTopic":49561,"prevInTime":49559,"nextInTime":49561,"topicId":49551,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The problem is there are not real answers to most of the problems people post about.
