That&#39;s the answer right there. I cannot thank you enough!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have an almost 11 yr old DS and he&#39;s taught me a LOT over the years. And, I have an almost 41 yr old hubby who can have the same transition issues as well (I joke that they share a brain because they&#39;re so much alike). It was really helpful when DS was really little to be able to run an idea past DH and see what he thought because he could run it through his own &quot;when I was that age&quot; filter - both in the &#39;traditional&#39; mode as he was raised and how he felt about it and in the &quot;if I could be a kid again, this is what I&#39;d want to happen&quot; filter.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAs far as new stuff, relax. There&#39;s no reason ANYONE has to try anything new ever - really (okay well babies do eventually need to stop eating off momma at some point, for momma&#39;s sanity if nothing else). I often buy 4 pairs of the same exact jeans so I don&#39;t actually have to try anything &quot;new&quot; - I just grab &quot;pants&quot; and that&#39;s it. Part of trying something new is deciding - &quot;if I&#39;m not having my usual mac & cheese, then what exactly will I have? There are 30 things on this menu...&quot; It can be overwhelming, making the &quot;right&quot; choice - and yes, that&#39;s probably how it&#39;s being framed in his head - there&#39;s a &#39;right&#39; food and everything else isn&#39;t. Easier to stick to a known &#39;right answer&#39; than to risk a &#39;wrong&#39; answer (not that you&#39;re giving that impression, just relating what I&#39;ve learned from DS because he&#39;d verbalize these sorts of things). So, we&#39;ve had all sorts of strategies over time to sort this type of stuff out. A biggie is freeing him from the idea that there&#39;s no way out once a choice is made. We&#39;ve doggie bagged many an entr√©e because DS tried something new and didn&#39;t want it. He knew he was free to try it and then choose something else. We evolved a system for a while where I kept 3 &quot;cocktail toothpicks&quot; in my purse - each with a different color cellophane on it. He&#39;d look over the kid&#39;s menu (Or adult menu, his choice) and identify which 3 items were possible at that point (and we had variants on the strategy for &gt;3 options that were all possible). Each option was assigned to a toothpick. I&#39;d hide them, point up, in my hand, so it was a random selection. When he pulled the yellow (for example) we&#39;d look and see that mac & cheese was assigned to yellow. Then he&#39;d decide if that was his choice or if that was getting tossed aside. And so on. It was a way to bring the myriad options down to manageable. We&#39;ve also given him information - &#39;I had the tilapia last time and it was quite tasty. It had a buttery sauce on it that I liked, not too salty or spicy. The broccoli with it was cooked good - not mushy or hard.&quot; I might point out ways to adjust things or favorites he&#39;s had before (&quot;Oh look - the soup of the day is clam chowder! I know you like that so I thought I&#39;d mention it for you to think about&quot;). The freedom to change his mind even AFTER we&#39;ve ordered really helps him to be able to actually decide BEFORE we order (did that make sense? LOL) It&#39;s a lot like buying shoes - if you know you can return them even after wearing them for a day or two, it&#39;s a lot easier to decide than if you are &#39;stuck&#39; with whatever you pick right this minute. There are always OPTIONS but often having not enough AND having too many can both be problematic.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nOh, also, a good book was Parenting your Spirited Child. Don&#39;t agree with 100% of it but it was very helpful in making me consciously aware of some things I kind of knew but couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on KWIM? Once I was conscious of it, it was easier to make a habit of ways to address those areas (developing tools), instead of having to think about it every time a situation arose. I don&#39;t have to -think- about bringing along DS&#39; bag o&#39; stuff when we go someplace, it&#39;s a habit to make sure he&#39;s got water, snack, a few current favorite portable activities. And, now that DS is older, he actually goes and packs his bag himself some of the time. He&#39;s learned, from my habits, the things that are helpful skills/tools for his own self to use.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nDeb R\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n**********************************************************************\r<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and\r<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they\r<br/>\nare addressed.
