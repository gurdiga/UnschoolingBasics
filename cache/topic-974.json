I have told her that I will remind her, but she needs to make<br/>\n  herself do it.  She has requested that I brush my teeth with her, which I am<br/>\n  happy to do.  Looking back, I would have felt better if I had brushed my<br/>\n  teeth with her from the very beginning.  My feeling is that if that is what<br/>\n  you are doing, you are doing your best.  My daughter wanted us to brush her<br/>\n  teeth (at age 5), but we said she had to learn to do it herself.  This was<br/>\n  foolish of me, I should have brushed them as long as she wanted me to help<br/>\n  her.  Maybe you could just offer each night to brush her teeth and if she<br/>\n  declines, at least you tried.  You could make it a game of some sort.  There<br/>\n  are so many choices of tooth brushes and toothpaste, maybe you could<br/>\n  motivate her that way.  One positive parenting book suggests that you say<br/>\n  &quot;if you brush your teeth right away, I will have time to read three books to<br/>\n  you instead of just one&quot;.  My daughter lost a baby tooth to decay and I do<br/>\n  not think the consequence of that really had any effect on her whatsoever.<br/>\n  It was quite painful, and expensive.  She also had several fillings on her<br/>\n  baby teeth.  However, I know some children that have lots of cavity&#39;s<br/>\n  despite the fact that they brush and floss each day.  Our dentist said that<br/>\n  baby teeth are sometimes prone to decay, but are not an indication of what<br/>\n  the child&#39;s adult teeth will be like.  In addition, a child&#39;s diet has a lot<br/>\n  to do with cavity protection.  Any sugars that stick to the teeth usually do<br/>\n  damage within 20 minutes and no one brushes that often.  My son never had<br/>\n  cavities and now has one on his last baby tooth.  Unfortunately it may be<br/>\n  damaging an adult tooth that is next to it.  We will not know until it falls<br/>\n  out.  He is good at brushing his teeth, but this was an issue of not<br/>\n  flossing and sucking cough drops at night due to allergies.  So, there are<br/>\n  many factors involved and you just have to do your best.  When I was a child<br/>\n  they had us chew red tablets to show where we were not brushing very well.<br/>\n  It motivated me for a couple of days.  Sometimes I open my mouth to show my<br/>\n  children my own fillings.  This works as motivation some of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"brushing teeth","postDate":"1088142608","msgId":1019,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzYzMwMWM0NWE3OCQ0NTkzMTkyMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBmbG9zc2llPg=="},"prevInTopic":1018,"nextInTopic":1020,"prevInTime":1018,"nextInTime":1020,"topicId":974,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Robyn, Thanks for the post.

Sometimes she brushes mine and then I brush hers, a game we enjoy -<br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s really gentle. She brushes her teeth herself most times, and then I<br/>\n&gt; give them an extra go. Jayn has one cavity in the first molar, which she<br/>\n&gt; seems quite interested in. Her teeth came in very late (none til 12<br/>\nmonths)<br/>\n&gt; and I think she has been fortunate to inherit her father&#39;s strong teeth,<br/>\n&gt; instead of my cavity prone ones. All the brushing in the world when I was<br/>\n&gt; young and I still ended up with four rows of silver. Also she is still<br/>\n&gt; nursing.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I invite her to brush her teeth whenever I do (which is usually twice a<br/>\n&gt; day). I have talked about cavities in an honest way - &quot;if you don&#39;t brush<br/>\n&gt; your teeth they look yellow, and you *might* get more cavities&quot;. I have<br/>\n&gt; talked about how they will all come out and she will get new permanent<br/>\nones<br/>\n&gt; that she might want to brush more. She seems to like to floss when she<br/>\nsees<br/>\n&gt; me doing so, although of course with her milk teeth there is a lot of<br/>\nspace<br/>\n&gt; between them. We have looked at photos of bad teeth online and talked<br/>\nabout<br/>\n&gt; gum disease.

One child deliberately started trying to terrify<br/>\n&gt; her, talking about how the dentist puts you into a big chair in the dark,<br/>\n&gt; and your mommy can&#39;t be with you, and you scream. I immediately said,<br/>\n&quot;That<br/>\n&gt; is not the kind of dentist Jayn will go to&quot;.

I mean when you say &quot;unschooling&quot; food and bedtimes are almost automatically included, but there are several other things that might give some of us new people a bit more insight instead of running around the same bush over and over, if that makes sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am inclined to honour her wishes and just let it be.... she does willingly rinse with ozonated water each evening, so I know that the bad bacteria that cause cavities are being eliminated on the surface at least. BUT if she needs to go to the dentist, I know how much of a traumatic event this will be for her, from history and it is an additional expense that my dh and I will have to absorb. So the inclination is, unless you can pay for the dental work yourself you will brush your teeth as I say.. however I hate that. But when we are working out strategies for these things, isn&#39;t things like consequences (financial in this case) as well as future emotional trauma to be considered? And when she say &quot;oh I won&#39;t get one mama&quot; like she can will it to not happen, how do you honour that and let it going knowing what the probability is? <br/>\n<br/>\nSO there you go.... have fun and be gentle with me:)<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nLooking for safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: pam sorooshian <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Thursday, June 24, 2004 11:33 AM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] brushing teeth<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri you just cracked me up!!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  In your previous post you wanted to get away from discussion of <br/>\n  bedtimes and all that - but in this one you jumped right into the big <br/>\n  &quot;toothbrushing question&quot;!!! &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s how these topics get started - unschooling does get  those <br/>\n  &quot;question everything&quot; juices flowing, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n  -pam<br/>\n<br/>\n  On Jun 24, 2004, at 11:06 AM, Sherri-Lee Pressman wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; On my journey to discover the depths of unschooling, I heard lots <br/>\n  &gt; about bedtimes, food and choices.

And now I wonder about this... what do you do about the job of brushing teeth? Do your children decide for themselves if they are going to brush their teeth now, ever, at all? How do you handle this? If they don&#39;t and end up with cavities, do they pay for their own dental work? or do you?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a 4 year old, who rarely lets me brush her teeth, I have refused to get into a physical battle over teeth brushing in the evenings so have let her do her own.. she does a crappy job... chomps on the brush and very rarely lets me brush them for her. I tried all the fun games and for awhile the Winnie the Pooh characters lived in her mouth and had to be brushed out, this worked but didn&#39;t last for ever. So I know these are baby teeth and we wouldn&#39;t do any dental work unless it was causing her pain, she is completely horrified at the idea of seeing a dentist. So I try to explain to her the importance of brushing... I brush mine at the same time as her as well... and she responds... she just won&#39;t get any cavities (logic of a 4 year for you) so in an unschooling philosophy would you just leave it at that or would you (seeing as you know she will get cavities) be more forceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease notice I said *more* forceful. I am not going to get in the situation where one parent is holding her down and the other brushes her teeth even with her screaming etc... like some parents I know do... but how would you experienced unschoolers handle this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nLooking for safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44278,"nextTopicId":44129}}
