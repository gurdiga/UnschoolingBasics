I have been struggling to &quot;de school&quot; my mind and trust the process. My 7 yr old has Aspergers and sensory issues and I know that the unschool way works best for him. Most days I feel ok in my decisions, but I often wonder- does he know what he should? Is he behind his age group? Am I providing enough? Is he getting it? etc...etc... <br/>\nI know those are mostly &quot;school&quot; questions and I ask myself who is to say what you &quot;should&quot; know at what age and just why are you comparing your kids to anyone? But the doubt keeps coming.. <br/>\nI belong to some homeschool groups but they are like others have posted before (just doing school, but at home)  I really believe in more organic learning, so its hard to fit in at times. <br/>\nI am happy that I found this group and hope to get to know some of you better. <br/>\nIf anyone is in Oklahoma please let me know. We are just NW of OKC.<br/>\nStephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41747,"nextTopicId":41908}}
