That lasted for a whole 6 months<br/>\n&gt; when we realized<br/>\n&gt; that neither of us wanted to be the &quot;every other<br/>\n&gt; weekend parent.&quot;  We<br/>\n&gt; were also spending a lot of time together because we<br/>\n&gt; wanted to both be<br/>\n&gt; involved in our children&#39;s lives.  He would come<br/>\n&gt; over every weekend to<br/>\n&gt; do laundry (I took the washer and dryer) and have<br/>\n&gt; dinner with us or<br/>\n&gt; come over for some activity that was happening at<br/>\n&gt; the kids&#39; school or<br/>\n&gt; some other function that we were doing (art fairs,<br/>\n&gt; music concerts,<br/>\n&gt; days at the beach, etc.)  Finally we realized that<br/>\n&gt; we were paying<br/>\n&gt; twice the rent, twice the utilities and twice the<br/>\n&gt; insurance, so we<br/>\n&gt; bought a house together with 5 bedrooms (one for<br/>\n&gt; each person) and have<br/>\n&gt; lived this way for 2.5 years.  I think the important<br/>\n&gt; thing is that we<br/>\n&gt; *are* friends and care deeply for each other and<br/>\n&gt; each other&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; welfares.

We also both know that as the<br/>\n&gt; kids get older<br/>\n&gt; that we may decide to move on.  The other thing that<br/>\n&gt; we agreed on was<br/>\n&gt; that we didn&#39;t want other people to tear this odd<br/>\n&gt; little family apart.<br/>\n&gt;   That whoever we met that we wanted to have a<br/>\n&gt; relationship with would<br/>\n&gt; have to be absorbable into this family not divide<br/>\n&gt; this family up (at<br/>\n&gt; least for now).

I did have one friend who divorced who was<br/>\nhomeschooling and her now ex was at least supportive of their children<br/>\ncontinuing to homeschool.  They worked through their divorce through<br/>\nan mediator rather than going at it with the courts.  They agreed to<br/>\ncertain things so that when they did go in front of the judge for the<br/>\nfinal decree they were seen as parents who were working together and<br/>\nin agreement rather than fighting about nit picky little things.  You<br/>\nwould have to know how your dh would hand it.  Un/homeschooling can<br/>\ncontinue *if* the other parent will still be cooperative.  I had<br/>\nanother friend who lost the right to homeschool even though her ex was<br/>\nsupportive when they were married.  When they divorced he suddenly was<br/>\nopposed to homeschooling.  Not because he truly opposed it but it was<br/>\nhis way to be vindictive.  :(  It was all about him and not about the<br/>\nchildren.  :((((((<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205756159,"authorName":"Lesa ODaniel","from":"&quot;Lesa ODaniel&quot; &lt;lesaodaniel@...&gt;","profile":"lesao2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Divorce or separation and unschooling...","postDate":"1159543863","msgId":17666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEwMi1GMjExRTRFQTM4NDY3RkQxMjUzQjY3NUIwMTgwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA5MjkwNzM3bTNmM2FlOTQ4aGFmYTBjYTIxNWVmNTNlYTJAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":17664,"nextInTopic":17667,"prevInTime":17665,"nextInTime":17667,"topicId":17655,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-824281162\">&lt;&lt;Michelle wrote:<br/>\nWhen we first started this venture we felt like we were the only ones that <br/>\nwere in this unique situation, but since then we have met others who have <br/>\nsimilar stories.

From my observations, in  <br/>\nour family and in those of my friends, it&#39;s very very common for  <br/>\npeople to feel this way at some point in their marriage. The &#39;seven  <br/>\nyear&#39; itch may not go on that time period, but it&#39;s a fact that they  <br/>\noccur. Let&#39;s see, quote &quot;The first decline, Kurdek says, is probably  <br/>\na normal adjustment to new roles; the second decline is often related  <br/>\nto the birth of children. Couples experiencing the seven year itch  <br/>\ndisagree with each other more, become less affectionate, share fewer  <br/>\nactivities, and express overall dissatisfaction with their marriages,  <br/>\nsays Kurdek, whose study was published in the September 1999 issue of  <br/>\nthe journal Developmental Psychology.&quot; unquote. I wanted to say that  <br/>\nup front, just because it seems to be an issue hardly ever addressed,  <br/>\nand I would dislike to see anyone make a huge life change based on  <br/>\nodd emotions that they think are unusual (or unacceptable). It wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthat long ago when I looked at my husband one day and had no idea who  <br/>\nhe was, even his appearances seemed foreign to me. It would have been  <br/>\n(relatively) easy emotionally to leave him right then (and I say  <br/>\nrelative because I knew that life after divorce is very hard, and  <br/>\nbecause emotions change, and I&#39;d have kids who were struggling).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child of divorced parents, I can assure you there is a lot of  <br/>\nfall-out. As Ren mentioned your husband may feel betrayed and  <br/>\ndeserted. Your son may grow up wondering (no matter how amicable) if  <br/>\nit was something he did. You may regret it some day, but the  <br/>\nrelationship with your husband will never be the same. There are new  <br/>\npeople on each side of the equation, and everyone needs something.  <br/>\nThere are new houses for your son to adjust to, there are friends who  <br/>\nfeel like they have to choose sides, there are inlaws you may lose  <br/>\nthe friendship of. Just me saying to my husband some of the things I  <br/>\nwas thinking, changed our relationship (and not for the better  <br/>\ninitially). We&#39;ve spent the better part of the six months courting  <br/>\neach other again and trying to build a new connection. And in  <br/>\nhindsight, it&#39;s funny to me, because what it took was putting the  <br/>\nsame attention to my husband and my marriage as I do the kids. It&#39;s  <br/>\nquite easy, when the kids are young, to legitimize putting all your  <br/>\nattention and energy on them, but marriage is like a young child too.  <br/>\nThe L&L conference was rather like a honeymoon for us, to celebrate  <br/>\nrebuilding our relationship, and our new lives as unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Sandra was the one who mentioned abusive relationships. I  <br/>\nwould never say to stick it out to someone who was in a violent  <br/>\nrelationship and therapy was not an option. But I would encourage you  <br/>\nto look at why you are having strange thoughts, what exactly your  <br/>\nheart is asking for, and try to figure out how to get it from your  <br/>\nhusband. Give HIM what you need, and trust that it will come back to  <br/>\nyou, because if you&#39;re feeling this way, he&#39;s probably picking up on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this got longer than I thought.
