I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>\n    increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>\n  much<br/>\n    better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>\n    approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me<br/>\n  and<br/>\n    not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>\n    noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>\n<br/>\n    She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\n  ignore<br/>\n    it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>\n  articulating<br/>\n    it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my<br/>\n  opinion,<br/>\n    doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>\n    expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in<br/>\n  his<br/>\n    parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>\n    been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot.<br/>\n  He<br/>\n    spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>\n    her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>\n    appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>\n    that and did even more today.<br/>\n<br/>\n    I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after<br/>\n  the<br/>\n    baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>\n    house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that<br/>\n  I<br/>\n    am sure will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n    It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>\n  but<br/>\n    reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>\n    of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>\n  know?<br/>\n    Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n    I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>\n    harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>\n    your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>\n    this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>\n<br/>\n    I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>\n    unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had<br/>\n  done<br/>\n    recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable<br/>\n  of<br/>\n    dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the<br/>\n  case<br/>\n    I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>\n<br/>\n    Sherri-Lee<br/>\n    Need safe and natural health products?<br/>\n    http://www.aloeessence.com<br/>\n    -----Original Message-----<br/>\n    From: Robyn Coburn [mailto:dezigna@...] <br/>\n    Sent: Tuesday, September 14, 2004 3:14 AM<br/>\n    To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n    Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] help<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>\n    child<br/>\n    for me to be around and it seems so specific to me.

Sometimes I<br/>\n    mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when<br/>\n  she<br/>\n    spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>\n<br/>\n    When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce<br/>\n  off<br/>\n    me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge<br/>\n  on<br/>\n    you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\n    her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\n    still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She<br/>\n  will<br/>\n    go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\n    her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting<br/>\n  to<br/>\n    get angry.

Are you trying to do too<br/>\n    much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>\n    can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>\n    and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>\n    service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>\n    Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>\n    inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>\n    rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>\n    decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read<br/>\n  and<br/>\n    know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest<br/>\n  is<br/>\n    rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>\n    melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I<br/>\n  have<br/>\n    to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>\n    decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>\n    decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to<br/>\n  explain<br/>\n    anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear<br/>\n  you<br/>\n    now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>\n    personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>\n    communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n    hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>\n    solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>\n    coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>\n    responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>\n    emotional burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n    One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the<br/>\n  possibilities<br/>\n    for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>\n    you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>\n    after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>\n    (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the<br/>\n  meltdown<br/>\n    behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you<br/>\n  think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n    you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>\n    hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>\n    response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t<br/>\n    like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes<br/>\n  I<br/>\n    just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>\n    business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has<br/>\n  been<br/>\n    playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>\n    audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>\n    &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>\n    she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without<br/>\n  first<br/>\n    negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>\n    eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>\n    show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>\n    talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>\n    possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>\n    particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>\n    resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a<br/>\n  DVD<br/>\n    for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In<br/>\n  terms<br/>\n    of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>\n    attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>\n    attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>\n<br/>\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>\n    Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n    Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>\n    &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her<br/>\n  and<br/>\n    the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>\n    behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at<br/>\n  the<br/>\n    moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>\n    months ago. <br/>\n<br/>\n    This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>\n<br/>\n    Robyn L.

I love hearing that I am not alone. It is too easy to get<br/>\ninto talking about all the great things our kid do, which seems to be<br/>\nopposite to the mainstream way, that I sometimes forget that the people I<br/>\nadmire on my lists aren&#39;t always perfect parents:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI had never thought about a growth spurt causing melt downs but of course it<br/>\nmakes sense. I am stymied about the food thing, because she is so clearly<br/>\nhungry but simply will not eat unless I completely make her turn things off<br/>\nand come to the table. It has never been a battle before but all of a sudden<br/>\nshe is so interested in what she wants to do that she doesn&#39;t want to stop -<br/>\nI understand that, but simply she has to eat or she is screaming at me all<br/>\nthe time and I can&#39;t take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had hired a woman to come last fall with her daughter who was the same age<br/>\nas Hannah. They would come and play and I would either be upstairs working<br/>\nor go out to do something. It worked very well for awhile and then the girls<br/>\nstarted to have conflicts and the mom stopped being involved. I would come<br/>\nin and find her copying recipes out of a magazine I had left out, while the<br/>\ngirls were in the house running around and around the kitchen screaming at<br/>\nthe top of their lungs, until one of them just lost it. Not value for my<br/>\ndollar. So we stopped last Christmas and it was obvious it had just become<br/>\nthat Hannah was spending too much time with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen this spring when I found out I was pregnant, I asked my SIL (who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work) if she wanted to come over and spend time with Hannah 3 times<br/>\na week for 2 hours each time. They got along great and she made some money.<br/>\nThat lasted for awhile, but then it just became too much again. She is very<br/>\nrigid and stiff and unimaginative and Hannah would just get sick and tired<br/>\nof her rigidity and she was screaming at her too much. So we slowed that<br/>\ndown a lot. Now it is just rarely that we use her and although Hannah<br/>\nresists at the idea, they have fun once she gets here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo will try to get her in next week and see how that works... Hannah has<br/>\nagreed in theory so far so that is good. Believe me I have thought about<br/>\nsticking her in preschool just to get a break, but how can I do that, when I<br/>\ntotally disagree with school and have told her we homeschool for the last<br/>\nyear LOL... I can&#39;t be using it as a baby sitter service just because life<br/>\nis getting tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the comments, good to hear from you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: mamaaj2000 [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mamaaj2000@...\">mamaaj2000@...</a>] <br/>\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 2004 5:02 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: help<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri-<br/>\n-lee@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I will try to arrange his sister to come play with Hannah one day <br/>\n </span></blockquote>next week<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; so I can have some time alone upstairs at least, but she is someone <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; only ok on a very occasional basis, as we found out earlier in the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>year when<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we over used her LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s tough.

I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>\n  increased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a<br/>\nmuch<br/>\n  better day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>\n  approach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me<br/>\nand<br/>\n  not her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>\n  noticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>\n<br/>\n  She did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>\nignore<br/>\n  it, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for<br/>\narticulating<br/>\n  it because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my<br/>\nopinion,<br/>\n  doesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>\n  expect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in<br/>\nhis<br/>\n  parenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>\n  been pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot.<br/>\nHe<br/>\n  spends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>\n  her again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>\n  appreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>\n  that and did even more today.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  baby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>\n  house cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that<br/>\nI<br/>\n  am sure will help.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>\nbut<br/>\n  reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what colour<br/>\n  of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>\nknow?<br/>\n  Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I am breathing... and trying to not expect respect from her... that seems<br/>\n  harder when you are feeling resentful right? Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>\n  your thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>\n  this this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>\n<br/>\n  I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>\n  unschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had<br/>\ndone<br/>\n  recently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable<br/>\nof<br/>\n  dealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the<br/>\ncase<br/>\n  I guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sherri-Lee<br/>\n  Need safe and natural health products?<br/>\n  http://www.aloeessence.com<br/>\n  -----Original Message-----<br/>\n  From: Robyn Coburn [mailto:dezigna@...] <br/>\n  Sent: Tuesday, September 14, 2004 3:14 AM<br/>\n  To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n  Subject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] help<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>\n  child<br/>\n  for me to be around and it seems so specific to me. Maybe she is mad at<br/>\nme.<br/>\n  mad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of<br/>\nenergy<br/>\n  in the last month?<br/>\n  Situations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>\n  screams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>\n  &quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>\n  screaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she<br/>\nhas<br/>\n  ever had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>\n  one til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell<br/>\nInstitute<br/>\n  (and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>\n  irrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>\n  be relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>\n  typical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>\n  would be another matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>\n  but in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your<br/>\nvery<br/>\n  pregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>\n  physical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>\n  the upcoming baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>\n  I just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how<br/>\nthey<br/>\n  are issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>\n  this&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>\n  what to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong<br/>\nthing<br/>\n  (no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Look really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>\n  between &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n  If you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>\n  request cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does<br/>\ntake<br/>\n  the wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>\n  mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when<br/>\nshe<br/>\n  spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce<br/>\noff<br/>\n  me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge<br/>\non<br/>\n  you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\n  her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\n  still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She<br/>\nwill<br/>\n  go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\n  her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting<br/>\nto<br/>\n  get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>\n  she is often better.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in<br/>\nreaction<br/>\n  to<br/>\n  the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing<br/>\nwith<br/>\n  her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>\n  opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>\n  her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more<br/>\ntoys<br/>\n  all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>\n  lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>\n  to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>\n  your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>\n  much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>\n  can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>\n  and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>\n  service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>\n  Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>\n  inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>\n  rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>\n  decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read<br/>\nand<br/>\n  know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest<br/>\nis<br/>\n  rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>\n  melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I<br/>\nhave<br/>\n  to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>\n  decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>\n  decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to<br/>\nexplain<br/>\n  anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear<br/>\nyou<br/>\n  now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>\n  personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>\n  communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n  hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>\n  solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>\n  coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>\n  responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>\n  emotional burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the<br/>\npossibilities<br/>\n  for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>\n  you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>\n  after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>\n  (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the<br/>\nmeltdown<br/>\n  behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you<br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n  you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>\n  hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>\n  response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t<br/>\n  like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes<br/>\nI<br/>\n  just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>\n  business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has<br/>\nbeen<br/>\n  playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>\n  audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>\n  &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>\n  she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without<br/>\nfirst<br/>\n  negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>\n  eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>\n  show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>\n  talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>\n  possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>\n  particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>\n  resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a<br/>\nDVD<br/>\n  for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In<br/>\nterms<br/>\n  of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>\n  attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>\n  attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>\n  Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>\n  &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her<br/>\nand<br/>\n  the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>\n  behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at<br/>\nthe<br/>\n  moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>\n  months ago. <br/>\n<br/>\n  This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Robyn L.

I remembered it this morning as my dd ranted and railed<br/>\nbecause her father stopped playing with her after 30 minutes of wrestling,<br/>\nto go back to work. She was then over hungry and frustrated and mad and I<br/>\ngot the brunt of it. Screaming and shouting and kicking. Screaming go away<br/>\nand leave me alone, but the second I get up to do what she wants, she is<br/>\ngrabbing at me, tripping me and screaming &quot;please stay with me mommy!&quot; I<br/>\nfind this SO hard. But I think I did well. I literally folded my lips up<br/>\nbetween my teeth and just sat on the bed and listened. When she was rude to<br/>\nme I would say &quot;of course I will do so and so for you, but then I would do<br/>\nit if you asked politely too&quot;. This went on for over 30 minutes, hardly<br/>\nmakes 30 minutes of play seem well... worthwhile. Wanted desperately to say<br/>\n&quot;if you keep this up daddy won&#39;t play with you in the mornings anymore&quot; but<br/>\nI didn&#39;t. But I have to say I felt resentment at being left to deal with the<br/>\nfall out of the play.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe wanted me to carry her down the stairs, I said I would piggy back her,<br/>\nbut being this pregnant I wasn&#39;t comfortable carrying her on my front down<br/>\nstairs anymore. Well that set her off again. Totally refusing the piggy<br/>\nback. Finally she wanted me to go ask her dad to come get her, which he did,<br/>\nthankfully. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen when we got downstairs, she tells him how mean I am to her, because I<br/>\ngot mad at her upstairs. Which I did not. I am so damned hormonal, I just<br/>\nstarted to cry and looked at her told her that hurt my feelings and that it<br/>\nwas unfair. She just didn&#39;t care and went about her business. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot a great start to the day. It has not gotten a lot better except when she<br/>\nis on the computer playing her new Dora game. It is my computer though and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t get any time on it now, because asking her to share is like asking<br/>\nBush to leave Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to be detached from her emotions today, but it is hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know she is acting this way partly because she is hungry, but she won&#39;t<br/>\nstop on the computer to eat, so I get the end result. She won&#39;t leave the TV<br/>\nto eat so I get the fall out. I am feeling really angry and resentful that I<br/>\never let her on the computer or released limits on the TV when this is the<br/>\nend result. Yes she can eat in front of the TV and we do that, but I will<br/>\nnot let her eat while on the computer. It is my laptop that I worked long<br/>\nand hard to pay for and she will not eat while on it. So she says &quot;leave it<br/>\nover there and I will come and have a bite&quot; but then she doesn&#39;t and gets<br/>\ntoo hungry and I am the one who gets the fall out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry this is SO off topic and just a bunch of whining.

She was 4.5 and I was in my <br/>\n3rd trimester.  I was as drained and frustrated as you with the <br/>\nbehavior, demands and conflicts.  From the wise people on several <br/>\nboards and a myriad of parenting books, I learned that much of it  <br/>\nindeed was/is NORMAL for her age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI began to emotionally detach myself from it, which is a lifesaver.  <br/>\nIt is hard to let our child express their emotions when they make us <br/>\nuncomfortable, and not to take them personally.  It is also difficult <br/>\nto step away from the need to feel respected at all times, and work <br/>\non being respectful and accepting of the child no matter what.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe cannot expect them to act like adults, but the secret, really <br/>\nseems to be giving them the same acceptance and respect as other <br/>\nadults. We model what we want. The benefit in doing so, I am finding, <br/>\nis that it then frees me up to share wuth my dd how what she is doing <br/>\nmakes me feel.  It has really helped to let her in on my perspective -<br/>\n&quot;boy, when you yell at me like that it makes me feel sad&quot; or &quot;sure <br/>\nI&#39;ll try to help you but I would appreciate if you asked me nicly <br/>\nnext time&quot; or &quot;I need your understanding and help right now&quot; or &quot;it <br/>\nreally frustrates me when you ____&quot; or &quot;try that again sweetly, <br/>\nplease&quot;.  I just started talking and talking to her like she was/is <br/>\nanother adult, and she listens.  Her behavior did not immediately <br/>\nchange but over time, I am seeing that she is responding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also began naming/validating her feelings more without offering <br/>\na &quot;fix&quot; for the situation -- &quot;you seem really angry.  How can I help <br/>\nyou feel better?&quot;  And I have also been offering positive time-outs, <br/>\nas in &quot;I see you are very frustrated right now. Perhaps it will help <br/>\nif you take a break to calm down and feel better.  Can I help you to <br/>\nyour room (or other chosen place)?  Would you like to bring a toy?  <br/>\nWould you like me to sit with you for awhile?  When you feel better, <br/>\nwe can talk.  Come out when you are ready.&quot;  I also have been giving <br/>\nmyself time-outs - &quot;I am feeling very bothered right now, I think I <br/>\nneed to take a break in the other room until I feel better.&quot;  It has <br/>\nreally seemed to help for her to see me do this, and she almost <br/>\nalways shifts her focus away from herself out of concern for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like alot to undertake when very pregnant, but even though I <br/>\ntoo just wanted to be ALONE, I decided that since that was mostly not <br/>\nan option, I made it a mission to be carried out in slow motion.  I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do much else (had to let many things go, like housework) but <br/>\nit was worth it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe, pray about it.  I pray all day, at every neccessary <br/>\nmoment.  Sometimes she looks at me like I am crazy, because I have <br/>\nsuch a delayed reaction while I search for wisdom.  But it often <br/>\ndiffuses.  So does a blank look and &quot;I love you&quot; when she is <br/>\nshrieking for something or giving me a nasty look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played &quot;Everything&#39;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; by Deanna Carter and <br/>\nother inspirational music on repeat for all to hear many a day (still <br/>\ndo).<br/>\n<br/>\nBless you,<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] help","postDate":"1095274238","msgId":3162,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PDBJNDIwMEIwTUVVT1daQGwtZGFlbW9uPg=="},"prevInTopic":3161,"nextInTopic":3163,"prevInTime":3161,"nextInTime":3163,"topicId":3143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1165080934\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I read your post this morning and it energized me for our day.

Thank you for<br/>\narticulating<br/>\nit because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my opinion,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>\nexpect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in his<br/>\nparenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>\nbeen pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot. He<br/>\nspends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>\nher again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>\nappreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>\nthat and did even more today.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another illustration of the phenomenon that made the &quot;Mars/Venus&quot;<br/>\nguy a fortune. Men do seem to communicate differently than women do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh, James, just has to be asked for help. He will always assume that I am<br/>\nOK unless I tell him otherwise, and hints or irony go right past him. He<br/>\nalso assumes he is doing enough unless I ask for more help. Plus even the<br/>\ntiniest amount of appreciation goes a huge way with him, just as even the<br/>\ntiniest criticism just about destroys him - the broken little boy comes back<br/>\nand then gets defensive. It can be disconcerting to realize that our big,<br/>\ngrown husbands sometimes seem to respond best to the same strategies that a<br/>\ndoggie will respond to, rather than like a rational person. ;) <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an added bonus modeling gratitude, approval and appreciation as primary<br/>\ntechniques for maintaining a loving marital relationship is also good for<br/>\nour children.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;It is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating<br/>\nbut reassuring. It can really get to me, cause I really don&#39;t care what<br/>\ncolour of hair she gives polly pocket when she is playing on the website you<br/>\nknow? Maybe it is her way of trying to get me involved with what she is<br/>\ndoing?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nA sound notion. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Jayn just wants me to sit with her, and I really try to do so as<br/>\nmuch as possible, even though sometimes I feel driven crazy by boredom. I<br/>\nsometimes have a book with me. Picture us: I am sitting on one chair, with<br/>\nJayn sitting either on my lap or between my knees. She is using the computer<br/>\nmouse and key board, while I hold a book or magazine out to the side to<br/>\nread, while still answering her questions and helping her to read the<br/>\nscreen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I know all about that particular website believe me - one of Jayn&#39;s<br/>\nfavorites. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>\nunschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had done<br/>\nrecently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>\ndealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the case<br/>\nI guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes there is a certain appearance of wildness as the freedoms are<br/>\ngrasped, but things calm down over time. Sometimes it is a reaction to the<br/>\nfear that controls will be reinstituted and so &quot;let&#39;s grab all we can now&quot;,<br/>\nalthough that doesn&#39;t sound like the dynamic you have described.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you mean by pulling back? I mean what actions would you be then<br/>\ntaking? It might be counter-productive if it ends up being more work<br/>\n(emotionally draining) for you to have to enforce certain choices. Maybe<br/>\nlook back at why you wanted to live this way in the first place....<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Hannah just needs more practice at getting good at making choices and<br/>\ngaining the feeling of confidence in herself. I have to say that we have<br/>\nalways lived this utterly free way, so my thoughts in this area may be less<br/>\nhelpful than others who have been through the process of changing. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Sometimes I<br/>\n  mention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>\n  spoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>\n<br/>\n  When she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>\n  me, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>\n  you less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\n  her or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\n  still validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>\n  go on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\n  her go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Sometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>\n  get angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>\n  she is often better.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction<br/>\n  to<br/>\n  the baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>\n  her cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>\n  opposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>\n  her? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>\n  all something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  There is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>\n  lot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>\n  to day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>\n  your emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>\n  much, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>\n  can find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>\n  and your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>\n  service? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>\n  Home delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>\n  inability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>\n  rejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>\n  decision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>\n  know what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>\n  rejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>\n  melt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>\n  to do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>\n  decide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>\n  decide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>\n  anything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>\n  now&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  This indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>\n  personalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>\n  communicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n  hear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>\n  solution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>\n  coming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>\n  responsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>\n  emotional burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n  One of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>\n  for say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>\n  you think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>\n  after comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>\n  (without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>\n  behavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Just because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\n  you actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>\n  hours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Are you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>\n  response to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>\n  like it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>\n  just have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>\n  business call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>\n  playing quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>\n  audience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>\n  &quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>\n  she subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>\n  negotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>\n  eachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>\n  show, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>\n  talking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>\n  possible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>\n  particular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>\n  resigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>\n  for her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>\n  of interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>\n  attention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>\n  attention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>\n  Cause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Breathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>\n  &quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>\n  the other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>\n  behave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>\n  moment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>\n  months ago. <br/>\n<br/>\n  This is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Robyn L.

She was 4.5 and I was in my <br/>\n3rd trimester.  I was as drained and frustrated as you with the <br/>\nbehavior, demands and conflicts.  From the wise people on several <br/>\nboards and a myriad of parenting books, I learned that much of it  <br/>\nindeed was/is NORMAL for her age.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI began to emotionally detach myself from it, which is a lifesaver.  <br/>\nIt is hard to let our child express their emotions when they make us <br/>\nuncomfortable, and not to take them personally.  It is also difficult <br/>\nto step away from the need to feel respected at all times, and work <br/>\non being respectful and accepting of the child no matter what.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe cannot expect them to act like adults, but the secret, really <br/>\nseems to be giving them the same acceptance and respect as other <br/>\nadults. We model what we want. The benefit in doing so, I am finding, <br/>\nis that it then frees me up to share wuth my dd how what she is doing <br/>\nmakes me feel.  It has really helped to let her in on my perspective -<br/>\n&quot;boy, when you yell at me like that it makes me feel sad&quot; or &quot;sure <br/>\nI&#39;ll try to help you but I would appreciate if you asked me nicly <br/>\nnext time&quot; or &quot;I need your understanding and help right now&quot; or &quot;it <br/>\nreally frustrates me when you ____&quot; or &quot;try that again sweetly, <br/>\nplease&quot;.  I just started talking and talking to her like she was/is <br/>\nanother adult, and she listens.  Her behavior did not immediately <br/>\nchange but over time, I am seeing that she is responding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also began naming/validating her feelings more without offering <br/>\na &quot;fix&quot; for the situation -- &quot;you seem really angry.  How can I help <br/>\nyou feel better?&quot;  And I have also been offering positive time-outs, <br/>\nas in &quot;I see you are very frustrated right now. Perhaps it will help <br/>\nif you take a break to calm down and feel better.  Can I help you to <br/>\nyour room (or other chosen place)?  Would you like to bring a toy?  <br/>\nWould you like me to sit with you for awhile?  When you feel better, <br/>\nwe can talk.  Come out when you are ready.&quot;  I also have been giving <br/>\nmyself time-outs - &quot;I am feeling very bothered right now, I think I <br/>\nneed to take a break in the other room until I feel better.&quot;  It has <br/>\nreally seemed to help for her to see me do this, and she almost <br/>\nalways shifts her focus away from herself out of concern for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems like alot to undertake when very pregnant, but even though I <br/>\ntoo just wanted to be ALONE, I decided that since that was mostly not <br/>\nan option, I made it a mission to be carried out in slow motion.  I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t do much else (had to let many things go, like housework) but <br/>\nit was worth it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you believe, pray about it.  I pray all day, at every neccessary <br/>\nmoment.  Sometimes she looks at me like I am crazy, because I have <br/>\nsuch a delayed reaction while I search for wisdom.  But it often <br/>\ndiffuses.  So does a blank look and &quot;I love you&quot; when she is <br/>\nshrieking for something or giving me a nasty look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played &quot;Everything&#39;s Gonna Be Alright&quot; by Deanna Carter and <br/>\nother inspirational music on repeat for all to hear many a day (still <br/>\ndo).<br/>\n<br/>\nBless you,<br/>\nMelissa Z.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] help","postDate":"1095223457","msgId":3156,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJNDIwMEo0VkZVQThBQGwtZGFlbW9uPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNTYwMWM0OWE2ZiRmN2FlMjkxMCQwMjAwYThjMEB5b3VybzBrd2t3OWp3Yz4="},"prevInTopic":3155,"nextInTopic":3157,"prevInTime":3155,"nextInTime":3157,"topicId":3143,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Julie, You are so right, thank you!

He is my youngest child and <br/>\nnumber 4 will be here any day. This all started in my 3rd trimester, <br/>\nwhen he realized he wasn&#39;t going to be the baby any more. I know <br/>\nwhat you&#39;re going through. I&#39;m living it right now. All I can tell <br/>\nyou is that I have to seperate myself from him just to breath. Sorry <br/>\nthat I don&#39;t have good advise. I just wanted to let you know that <br/>\nI&#39;m in the same boat that you&#39;re in. <br/>\nGood Luck, and I hope that things get better soon. <br/>\nMila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sherri-Lee Pressman <br/>\n&lt;sherri--lee@s...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hi everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just didn&#39;t know what else to title this: &quot;She is driving me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>crazy&quot;? &quot;I am<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; loosing my mind&quot;? &quot;my beautiful daughter has become a misery&quot;?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What ever I thought it was all so negative, and maybe that is all <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I need is<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a good solid kicking of an attitude adjustment, that is <br/>\n </span></blockquote>administered gently<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; given my 8 months pregnancy situation?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know, I just know I am so sad at the way things are these <br/>\n </span></blockquote>days.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unpleasant child<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for me to be around and it seems so specific to me.

Once the <br/>\nbaby was born, though, I faithfully arranged to have at least an hour every <br/>\nday just with her, while the baby was napping, interacting with my husband, <br/>\netc.   That was very hard (because I wanted that time to just be ALONE), but<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it really  helped her adjustment to having another member of the <br/>\nfamily.  After the baby was born, I also spent 3 or 4 afternoons a week at <br/>\nthe house of friend with a child Lydia&#39;s age. The kids played, the baby and <br/>\nI napped on the couch, and the friend brought me juice at intervals.  That <br/>\nwas really a lifesaver for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is really to breathe and remain calm and cheerful, so that <br/>\nyou are not modelling unpleasant behavior to her, and wait it out.

I just didn&#39;t expect it to feel so personal. I guess that is<br/>\nincreased by my pregnancy hormones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read your post this morning and it energized me for our day. We had a much<br/>\nbetter day and in fact I managed to have more energy and a more positive<br/>\napproach. She asked me to get her water, when it was inconvenient for me and<br/>\nnot her, I just did it. The surprise and pleasure in her voice was<br/>\nnoticeable. Did it make her feel special?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did  not speak in an angry or demanding tone so I didn&#39;t have to ignore<br/>\nit, but perhaps that was because I wasn&#39;t so impatient.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes I am overwhelmed and feeling a bit resentful. Thank you for articulating<br/>\nit because it helped me to see it. My dh, works very hard and in my opinion,<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do all he could around here to help with the parenting. I don&#39;t<br/>\nexpect him to do housework or anything but he goes in fits and spurts in his<br/>\nparenting interests and that does add to my stress. Lately however, he has<br/>\nbeen pitching in more without my having to ask and that has helped a lot. He<br/>\nspends time with her each morning wrestling and playing and then time with<br/>\nher again each evening after dinner. This is new and has been very<br/>\nappreciated. I told him that today and he seemed to appreciate me saying<br/>\nthat and did even more today.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met with a woman yesterday to come in and help with house stuff after the<br/>\nbaby comes, but decided we will get her in once a week starting now to do<br/>\nhouse cleaning, laundry, making beds etc. So that is a good decision that I<br/>\nam sure will help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is good to hear the indecisiveness is normal too... still frustrating but<br/>\nreassuring.

Ok... thank you SO much for<br/>\nyour thoughts on this, it really was so helpful to come downstairs to read<br/>\nthis this morning, AND to hear it will pass hopefully fairly soon:) <br/>\n<br/>\nI was beginning to think that this behaviour was a result of our shift to<br/>\nunschooling as it was the only big change I could think of that we had done<br/>\nrecently. And with giving her more choices, she seemed to be less capable of<br/>\ndealing with them, almost overwhelmed by them (which still might be the case<br/>\nI guess)I was thinking of pulling back on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thank you again for your help today,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nNeed safe and natural health products?<br/>\nhttp://www.aloeessence.com<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Robyn Coburn [mailto:dezigna@...] <br/>\nSent: Tuesday, September 14, 2004 3:14 AM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: RE: [unschoolingbasics] help<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Hannah (4.5) has become the most difficult, uncooperative, unpleasant<br/>\nchild<br/>\nfor me to be around and it seems so specific to me.

Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>\nwould be another matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>\nbut in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your very<br/>\npregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>\nphysical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>\nthe upcoming baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything.

There is a huge difference<br/>\nbetween &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>\nrequest cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does take<br/>\nthe wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>\nmention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>\nspoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>\nme, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>\nyou less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\nher or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\nstill validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>\ngo on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\nher go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>\nget angry.

Are you trying to do too<br/>\nmuch, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>\ncan find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>\nand your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>\nservice? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>\nHome delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>\ninability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>\nrejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>\ndecision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>\nknow what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>\nrejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>\nmelt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>\nto do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndecide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>\ndecide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>\nanything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>\nnow&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>\npersonalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>\ncommunicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nhear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>\nsolution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>\ncoming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>\nresponsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>\nemotional burden.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>\nfor say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>\nyou think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>\nafter comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>\n(without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>\nbehavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nyou actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>\nhours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>\nresponse to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>\njust have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>\nbusiness call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>\nplaying quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>\naudience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>\n&quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>\nshe subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>\nnegotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>\neachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>\nshow, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>\ntalking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>\npossible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>\nparticular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>\nresigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>\nfor her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>\nof interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>\nattention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>\nattention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>\nCause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>\n&quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>\nthe other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>\nbehave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>\nmoment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>\nmonths ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

At nearly 7, she is not like that at all.  Once the <br/>\nbaby was born, though, I faithfully arranged to have at least an hour every <br/>\nday just with her, while the baby was napping, interacting with my husband, <br/>\netc.   That was very hard (because I wanted that time to just be ALONE), but <br/>\nI think it really  helped her adjustment to having another member of the <br/>\nfamily.  After the baby was born, I also spent 3 or 4 afternoons a week at <br/>\nthe house of friend with a child Lydia&#39;s age. The kids played, the baby and <br/>\nI napped on the couch, and the friend brought me juice at intervals.  That <br/>\nwas really a lifesaver for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best advice is really to breathe and remain calm and cheerful, so that <br/>\nyou are not modelling unpleasant behavior to her, and wait it out.

Maybe she is mad at me.<br/>\nmad about the baby she has been looking forward to? About my lack of energy<br/>\nin the last month?<br/>\nSituations: unless I give her exactly what she wants when she wants it she<br/>\nscreams and yells at me &quot;you promised&quot; (even if I didn&#39;t), &quot;you have to&quot;,<br/>\n&quot;but I WANNNTTTTT  you to/it&quot; etc. Anything I say &quot;no&quot; to is greeted with<br/>\nscreaming and hollering and yelling and the biggest temper tantrums she has<br/>\never had&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read some of the Child Development books (eg: &quot;Child Behavior from<br/>\none til ten&quot; or &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; by Louise Ames) from Gessell Institute<br/>\n(and don&#39;t read the school preparedness chapters because they are<br/>\nirrelevant, and ignore the Cry it out sleep suggestions obviously) you may<br/>\nbe relieved to learn that they consider much of this type of behavior<br/>\ntypical of 4.5 year olds. Whether their suggestions are of any use to you<br/>\nwould be another matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn (4.75) does many, in fact almost all of the same obnoxious behaviors,<br/>\nbut in your case I would guess that they are being exacerbated by your very<br/>\npregnant situation - both in terms of your emotionally vunerable state,<br/>\nphysical energy limitations, and Hannah&#39;s possible regressive reaction to<br/>\nthe upcoming baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t really say yes to everything. I try to say yes often, but<br/>\nI just can&#39;t and won&#39;t say yes to every demand of hers. And that is how they<br/>\nare issued these days. demands. not asking: &quot;mommy do this!&quot; &quot;mommy I need<br/>\nthis&quot; &quot;mommy I can&#39;t do this&quot; (with the assumption that I will just *know*<br/>\nwhat to do to fix it and then if I go and do something it is the wrong thing<br/>\n(no matter what I do) and she screams at me for that too.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLook really hard at the &quot;no&#39;s&quot; you are saying. There is a huge difference<br/>\nbetween &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can, absolutely ignore the demanding tone of voice and fulfill the<br/>\nrequest cheerfully anyway, which is what I do mostly with Jayn. It does take<br/>\nthe wind out of the incipient meltdown a lot of the time. Sometimes I<br/>\nmention in passing that she sounded really demanding or angry to me when she<br/>\nspoke, but I never reply in kind to her. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she has an angry blasting meltdown, I let Jayn&#39;s anger just bounce off<br/>\nme, like a beach ball you aren&#39;t catching - it will get less (or impinge on<br/>\nyou less). I&#39;m talking about &quot;detachment&quot; from her emotions, NOT ignoring<br/>\nher or her requests. Just not allowing her frenzy to get me upset, while<br/>\nstill validating emotions back - &quot;you sound very angry/frustrated&quot;. She will<br/>\ngo on and I will say something very neutral like &quot;What a shame.&quot; It helps<br/>\nher go through the meltdown, and restore her own balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I also remind Jayn to take some deep breaths if she is starting to<br/>\nget angry. Sometimes her only relief is still to shriek. One good one and<br/>\nshe is often better.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;She is asking me to do so much more for her too (is this also in reaction<br/>\nto<br/>\nthe baby coming?) &quot;mommy get me some water&quot; even though she is standing with<br/>\nher cup right beside the water tower and I have just sat down at the<br/>\nopposite end of the room. Am I really supposed to get up and get that for<br/>\nher? Every 10 minutes there is a new demand more food, more water, more toys<br/>\nall something I have to do for her, &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of overwhelm and resentment coming through in your post -<br/>\nlot&#39;s of emphatic negative words. Are you getting enough help with the day<br/>\nto day stuff like the housework? Are you getting any support from dh for<br/>\nyour emotional ups and downs as hormones shift? Are you trying to do too<br/>\nmuch, when all you want to do is sit and contemplate the new baby? If you<br/>\ncan find a way to transfer responsibility for everything other than Hannah<br/>\nand your own immediate comfort to someone else (a temporary house cleaning<br/>\nservice? Ordering in dinner? Paying someone to come in and do the laundry?<br/>\nHome delivery of groceries?) maybe you won&#39;t feel so overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and yet she has developed and complete<br/>\ninability to making decisions. She wants me to pick her clothes and then<br/>\nrejects everything I chose. When I ask her to do it. no she can&#39;t make a<br/>\ndecision. She will just say &quot;I am hungry&quot; and I am supposed to mind read and<br/>\nknow what she wants, because she can&#39;t decide, but every thing I suggest is<br/>\nrejected. When I give up after I run out of suggestions, we have another<br/>\nmelt down and anger at me and her screaming that she can&#39;t decide and I have<br/>\nto do it for her. Hell we even had a melt down today because she couldn&#39;t<br/>\ndecide which toys to bring with us to the grocery store and wanted me to<br/>\ndecide for her. She wants me to do all these things, but if I try to explain<br/>\nanything to her about anything, she screams at me &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear you<br/>\nnow&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis indecisiveness is also a kind of normal development phase with some<br/>\npersonalities, according to what I have read, although she *is*<br/>\ncommunicating clearly and definitively when she says she &quot;doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nhear you now&quot;. Short phrases, not long reasoned explanations, might be the<br/>\nsolution here. As much as you may want her to understand where you are<br/>\ncoming from, emotionally or intellectually, it shouldn&#39;t be her<br/>\nresponsibility to have to do so. She may feel your explaining as an<br/>\nemotional burden.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things I do with Jayn when she is rejecting all the possibilities<br/>\nfor say a snack, is just let it go, with &quot;well I don&#39;t know dear. What do<br/>\nyou think?&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s all we have.&quot; Then I wait it out. Usually she soon<br/>\nafter comes back with the phrase, &quot;I guess I could have .....&quot;. Waiting<br/>\n(without engaging) for the readiness to decide, with or without the meltdown<br/>\nbehavior, can seem like an eternity. It really is less time than you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because she is screaming that you have to do it for her, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>\nyou actually do have to decide for her. She really won&#39;t choose to starve.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;If I go on the phone she starts making noise, after being quiet for<br/>\nhours,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you interacting with her when she is quietly playing, or only in<br/>\nresponse to her getting loud or initiating requests? Jayn sometimes doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike it when my attention is diverted from her by the phone, but sometimes I<br/>\njust have to stick my finger in my spare ear, momentarily, when it is a<br/>\nbusiness call for dh (usually just taking a quick message). If she has been<br/>\nplaying quietly, I sometimes forget that she may be viewing me as an<br/>\naudience to her fantasy play and sees the phone as an interruption of our<br/>\n&quot;conversation&quot;. I ask her to please be quiet - I have to say that usually<br/>\nshe subsides to a point. However I rarely make outgoing calls without first<br/>\nnegotiating with her for some time to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;if I start to talk to my dh, she starts to sing loud so we can&#39;t hear<br/>\neachother, or talking or screaming about something. If I want to watch a<br/>\nshow, after hours of her watching her shows, she all of a sudden starts<br/>\ntalking and talking out loud about everything possible as loud as<br/>\npossible.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn switches the set off repeatedly - so we have stopped engaging in that<br/>\nparticular battle. Dh goes to watch in the other room. I have just become<br/>\nresigned to recording everything I hope to view. Sometimes if I put on a DVD<br/>\nfor her, I can go to the bedroom and watch TV with dh for a while. In terms<br/>\nof interrupting our conversations, it is usually because Jayn is after his<br/>\nattention rather than mine. Could your dh give her some intense playing<br/>\nattention for a while in the evening when you are most drained?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;How do I handle this and respect her and me.<br/>\nCause I don&#39;t feel very respected or respectful right now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathe and try to stay centered. One thing may be to stop expecting<br/>\n&quot;respect&quot; from her. The idea behind modeling respectful treatment of her and<br/>\nthe other family members to each other, is that *eventually* she will also<br/>\nbehave that kind way automatically and naturally. She is behaving 4.5 at the<br/>\nmoment. It will pass. Jayn is already less obnoxious than she was three<br/>\nmonths ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is going to sound dumb, but try and get some rest, OK?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Really, really. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;m looking at this from the Law of Attraction perspective. Hannah is<br/>\nmatching with her behaviour something that you are not aware of and<br/>\nacknowledging within yourself, most probably. At 8 months preggies you may<br/>\nwant to spend some time with yourself and with the little one to come. You<br/>\nmay want someone else to &#39;do&#39; things for you. You may feel very much out of<br/>\nsorts with yourself and this body that is not as you might define beautiful<br/>\nand lovable. And nothing fits! There may also be some thoughts of<br/>\napprehension. Quite a lot may not be the way you want it to be.<br/>\nAnd all of this is not appropriate because you want to be a good mother and<br/>\ndo all the other stuff which is &#39;right&#39; and according to the books.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you give yourself a break? Could you stop to beat up on yourself for a<br/>\nmoment? Could you acknowledge that you are doing great and the best you can<br/>\nunder the circumstances. Can you allow yourself a breather, knowing that the<br/>\nmost important person at this moment should be you (and baby) and that you<br/>\nget your needs met first. If your little one does not know what she wants,<br/>\ndo you know what you want? I don&#39;t say that you should follow her lead and<br/>\nthrow a temper tantrum, but you may allow yourself the knowing that you are<br/>\nworthy of being loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou feel disempowered because you see that even if you stood on your head<br/>\nshe would not be satisfied. This just shows us that is is never about the<br/>\nthings we do for others that make them happy. btw, it also not the things<br/>\nothers do that make us happy or unhappy. Not really! :) It is how we<br/>\ninterpret what happens that results in our feeling good or bad. And we can<br/>\nre-interpret everything to mean something better about ourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake the moment where she wants you to mind read her preferences and rejects<br/>\nall your suggestions. I could interpret that as &#39;If she does not know what<br/>\nshe wants I&#39;ve failed (again).&#39; or &#39;If she does not know what she wants I am<br/>\nresponsible.&#39; or &#39;If she does not know what she wants it&#39;s nothing to do<br/>\nwith me.&#39; or &#39;I would love to know what I want and go for it.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that Hannah shows all the symptoms of &#39;OMG I have to share mommy&#39;s<br/>\nlove.&#39; And that is something we can&#39;t live with. We want ALL the love to<br/>\nflow to us at all times. This cannot be rationalised ever. The only way to<br/>\nsoothe this pain is to love, unconditionally. First yourself and then<br/>\nHannah.
