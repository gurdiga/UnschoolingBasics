Since she has more than once been overcome by her<br/>\nneed to pour water, the biggest development here has been her growing<br/>\nability to stop herself from doing it into the bed from a drinking bottle,<br/>\nand go pour water in the bathroom instead. Initially asking her to go to the<br/>\nbathroom, and if she couldn&#39;t do that at least to use the floor instead of<br/>\nthe bed, was my first suggestion to her. Showing her what a pain in the neck<br/>\nit is to have to change all the sheets down to the mattress cover, and point<br/>\na loud hair dryer onto the mattress worked a lot better than getting angry.<br/>\nNot getting angry has been my struggle in this situation, and I&#39;m happy to<br/>\nsay I have overcome my anger with just choosing to understand, and *express*<br/>\nmy understanding, that for some reason she sometimes just NEEDS to pour<br/>\nwater out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is really proud of herself for gaining this much self-control -<br/>\nstopping and running to the bathroom with her container. What would happen<br/>\nif the bathroom door were locked? I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might be better to somehow help him remember he can ask you for<br/>\nassistance - such as if he finds a door latched when he wants to go outside.<br/>\nOne of us goes outside with Jayn whenever she wants to be in the rain. She<br/>\nknows she can ask for me to open the screen door for her if it is closed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn alternative, since one of your concerns is baby proofing, could be a gate<br/>\nthat is low enough for him to climb over, but sturdy enough to keep in the<br/>\nbaby.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the angry father, when Jayn has done something that might upset Daddy,<br/>\nI try to tell him about it without her around, so he can get his grumps or<br/>\npissiness out with me, and then calm down before they interact. He is almost<br/>\nnever angry at her. If he is angry with me in her presence, it also upsets<br/>\nher a lot. Resolving our adult differences of opinion is the biggest issue<br/>\nin our home for me.

How dare that man grab him for<br/>\nany reason.  He deserved a raspberry at the very least.  I had someone grab<br/>\nmy arm like that as an adult and attempt to detain me.  We were in a very<br/>\ncrowded social situation and I literally could not get away.  I finally said<br/>\nI had to pee NOW!  I am still enraged by brute force.  I am so grateful to<br/>\nhear of a child&#39;s power in getting away from a violent adult.  Spit, bite,<br/>\nhit do whatever you have to do to get away.  Bravo Keegan!  Bravo momma for<br/>\nnot making him apologize for honoring his own body.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157863786,"authorName":"kay alina","from":"&quot;kay alina&quot; &lt;angelsguard@...&gt;","profile":"angelsguardalways","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Digest Number 27","postDate":"1086919237","msgId":577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjcwMWM0NGY1NyRlNDFmZTBlMCQxYTkxZmVhOUBkZWZhdWx0Mjc1NThtMj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwODY4ODMwMzkuMTY2MS4zMjkxNi5tMjRAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":578,"prevInTime":576,"nextInTime":578,"topicId":577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And now for the BEST part - this morning I was in the kitchen washing dishes, kids happily playing in the living room, I go in to check on them and 5yo has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1755783226\">And now for the BEST part - this morning I was in the kitchen<br/>\nwashing dishes, kids happily playing in the living room, I go in to<br/>\ncheck on them and 5yo has completely ripped the screen door (the<br/>\nvery same screen door that my husband just fixed about a month ago).<br/>\nWhy did he rip the screen door? Because he wanted the water to come<br/>\nin (it&#39;s raining here today). Daddy is probably going to be very mad<br/>\nabout this, what are we going to do? Daddy can&#39;t find me if I hide<br/>\nunder my bed. You can&#39;t hide under your bed forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time have your 5yo help you with the dishes.  It keeps chaos at bay and<br/>\nit is fun to do dishes with young ones.  They feel they are contributing and<br/>\nno screens need to be replaced.<br/>\nKay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":616,"nextTopicId":613}}
