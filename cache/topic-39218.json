We took a peak last June and decided it was perfect for us!  Like you, I checked out the CO homeschooling laws before deciding to even take a peak.  As an unschooler, I wanted to continue doing what was working for us.  After reviewing CO law and talking with members from various support groups, I decided to go with an umbrella group called West River Academy.  This umbrella group is for unschoolers.  (I do not want to be bothered with testing as well.  That was another reason for going with an umbrella group.)    <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are planning to visit or move to this area of Colorado, and would like to connect, I&#39;d be happy to meet with you.  You are welcome to contact me directly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood Luck in your decision!<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy Valimaki    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">    --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Angela Berry&quot; &lt;berryajj@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; HI Everyone/Anyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We really love the idea of moving to Colorado in fact booked tickets today to take a week and peak in May.
