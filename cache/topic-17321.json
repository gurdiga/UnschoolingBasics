So now I&#39;ve found<br/>\nunschooling and I begin to see that the problem lies in the learning<br/>\nattitude itself. I know it will take decades for something to change<br/>\nor probably it won&#39;t. But I can&#39;t help to want the general public to<br/>\nbe better informed!

Cam thought that sounded like a long time. Sounds <br/>\n*just* around the corner to *me*! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut by then, Cam and other unschoolers will be grown with almost grown <br/>\nchildren who&#39;ve been unschooled. Duncan&#39;s unschooled contemporaries <br/>\nwill be having their children and unschooling as well. If the lifestyle <br/>\nkeeps growing as it has these last few years, we should have quite an <br/>\n&quot;army&quot; shortly! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may sound ridiculously optimistic, but I prefer to think of myself <br/>\nas a realist. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe proof will be in the pudding, but until this generation is out and <br/>\nabout in large (enough!) numbers, no one will trust that it &quot;works&quot; as <br/>\nwe say it does. Most people aren&#39;t that... um.... trusting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil then (or maybe even until 40 years! &lt;G&gt;) we&#39;ll have to go one <br/>\nperson at a time on lists ---or maybe a family or three at a conference.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Studies&quot; will be in the form of the adult &quot;proof&quot;---*after* the fact. <br/>\nSlow progress, but it will happen.

They have access to more diversity in life, in friendships, <br/>\n&gt; and in subjects to learn about.<br/>\n&gt; There are a lot of people against homeschooling, but there are also many <br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers and unschoolers who are just as adimantly against what she&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; doing with her kids.  The debate gois on with other aspects of parenting <br/>\n&gt; like breast vs. bottle, stay at home or work, vaccinate or not, homeschool <br/>\n&gt; or school, to spank or not.  On both sides of each debate, there is a lot of <br/>\n&gt; viciousness and not a lot of willingness to understand where the other is <br/>\n&gt; coming from.  I am TTC, but I am not sure this aspect of motherhood is <br/>\n&gt; something I look forward to- having every choice berated by other moms.

For those not familiar, about two years ago this Margaret<br/>\nBoyce of Saugatuck (MI) wrote an editorial slamming homeschoolers.  Based on<br/>\nmy Swiss-cheese memory I think there was a huge refutation from around the<br/>\ncountry (don&#39;t recall anyone writing in to support her view but could be<br/>\nwrong).  Well, she&#39;s back it again.  This was published in the Holland<br/>\nSentinel this morning (9/18/06) in the Opinion section:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMISSING OUT ON BACK TO SCHOOL<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the Editor:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a whiff of autumn in the air, and football has begun.  One can feel<br/>\nthe excitement.  Why?  Because it is back to school time!  I know many<br/>\nchildren who just can&#39;t wait to begin, from kindergarten to high school,<br/>\nlooking forward to seeing the friends, including teachers, that have been<br/>\nmissed during the summer.  New clothes, new books and a new start in the<br/>\nyear.  Truly one of life&#39;s greatest milestones when everything is filled<br/>\nwith promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n            However, there is a group of children being robbed of this<br/>\nincredible experience.  Their parents, probably that they are being<br/>\nespecially virtuous, have decided that they will keep their children and<br/>\n&quot;home school&quot; because they (the parents) believe that they are able to bring<br/>\nall knowledge and learning to their children.  One parent told me that she<br/>\nwas keeping her child at home because &quot;Well, he cried when I took him to<br/>\nkindergarten.&quot;  Apparently she had failed to give him any experiences that<br/>\nprepared both of them the ability to separate, so she would deprive him of<br/>\nthis education.<br/>\n<br/>\n            There are several new studies that deal with this overzealous<br/>\nparenting.  Too much home pressure, too much togetherness, no chance for the<br/>\nchildren to find their own way.  I have written in the past of a Harvard<br/>\nstudy that followed a flock of homeschooled children that found no<br/>\nsignificant difference in their academic achievements that the traditionally<br/>\nschooled children, with the exception of some gaps where the parents were<br/>\njust now knowledgeable.  However, the mothers do get a huge ego boost.  Is<br/>\nthat why we have children?  To boost a mother&#39;s ego?  As an experienced mom<br/>\nas well as a former teacher, I believe that this intense parenting can<br/>\nusually have two outcomes.  One, the child becomes very stifled, unable to<br/>\nfunction independently at all, or what often happens, the moment the child<br/>\nreaches 18 (or sometimes younger) they are gone.  If they go to college, it<br/>\nwill be very far away.  As adults they will remain far away.  I have spoken<br/>\nwith many grown children who would say &quot;I could never live near my parents&quot;<br/>\nand enumerate the controls put upon them as children.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Raising children demands time, attention, encouragement, and<br/>\nletting go.  The words from a song in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;-&quot;How do you hold<br/>\na moonbeam in your hand?&quot;-can be a good question for parents.  It isn&#39;t<br/>\neasy, but the ones that can let go enough to allow their children to grow<br/>\ntheir own wings are the most successful.<br/>\n<br/>\n            Margaret Boyce, Saugatuck<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Holland Sentinel<br/>\n<br/>\nMonday, September 18, 2006<br/>\n<br/>\nPage A4, Opinion<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those interested in writing a response:<br/>\n<br/>\nMailing address:  54 W.
