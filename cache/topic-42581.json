We try to encourage the kids to sit and eat with us or at least sit and talk with us. We try to make sure that we have plenty of stuff that the kids can prepare for themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;He thinks the kids should be in bed at a &quot;decent time&quot; and get up at a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;decent time.&quot; He hasn&#39;t said what that time is but I think generally <br/>\nthey should be in bed by 10 and up around 8 or 9, I think.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a big issue in our house. The kids like to stay up late and sometimes get noisy. I used to buffer things and try to keep my husband from getting mad and yelling at them. I realized that I was dismissing his feelings and putting the kids&#39; needs ahead of his. When I quit trying to interfere and let my husband get mad at the kids, things got better. One of the things that I was inadvertently doing was putting the kids needs above my husband&#39;s needs as well as my own. I found that the issue wasn&#39;t about the bed time as much as it was about validating my husband and his needs. When he gets mad at the kids and yells at them, I instead try to help the kids understand his perspective. &quot;Dad is tired and wants to go to bed but can&#39;t because you guys are being so loud. Dad doesn&#39;t have a problem with you staying up but he does have a problem with you being so noisy.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. He&#39;s been getting up around 5 - exercising, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>eating, showering, e-mailing, working all before we even roll over <br/>\naround 9.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way you could get somebody to drive him to work at 5 and then you and the kids could go pick him up when he gets done in the afternoon. Then, as soon as you get home, fix him a nice big meal. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We have always co-slept and now have 2 king sized <br/>\n </span></blockquote>beds put together and we all sleep in the bed together so he and I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t slept near each other in years because there is always a kid <br/>\nor 2 between us and he would like for them to sleep in their own beds.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe cosleep and have a king and a twin. One of the things that we have done is made sure that my husband and I are next to each other. I have read that sleeping next to someone helps you reconnect. When my husband and I don&#39;t get to sleep next to each other, I can see a difference in his moods. If a kid falls asleep between us, he will move them to the other side of the bed. Being next to each other also allows us to talk quietly and cuddle while the kids sleep around us. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;He also feels I should be teaching them something, which is where I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>need some suggestions.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you take the activities that the kids are doing and break them down into what the kids are learning from them? I was really bothered by my daughter playing too many computer games so I decided to sit down and watch what she was actually doing. I got a new perspective on how much she was actually learning. I have a blog where I try to translate daily activities into learning/teaching concepts. I don&#39;t do it often but whenever I get concerned about not &quot;teaching&quot; them something, it helps me to write it out. When my husband got a little nervous about what they were learning, we worked out a solution where he would come home and ask the kids what they learned today. We didn&#39;t change any activities. We talked to the kids about their dad&#39;s concerns. We talked about the different things they were learning from their everyday activities so that when my husband asked about their day, they could tell him that they practiced X, Y, Z while playing a video game or watching a TV program. Rather than changing our activities, we changed how we thought about those activities. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He believes all they do is play video <br/>\n </span></blockquote>games, watch TV, play make-believe games, play with their friends etc. <br/>\nbut no &quot;structured&quot; anything.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that what they are doing? That is what my kids do. The big difference is how you think about those activities. If you see those activities as mindless or worthless, then you won&#39;t value those activities for the learning that occurs. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He believes we are doing a great disservice to our children.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What are his specific concerns? There is a good chance that his concerns are valid and can be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He believes although I am a certified teacher <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have become complacent and lazy and can&#39;t teach them. That with the <br/>\n5 of them and their needs I can&#39;t keep up and get done what needs to <br/>\nbe done in the home and with schooling.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is another valid concern. From his perspective, he probably sees you as being overwhelmed. My husband has indicated that I am so caught up in taking care of the kids that I don&#39;t take time to take care of myself or our relationship. As a result, we are not on the same page and we have become adversaries rather than being the best friends that we were when we got married. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Over the last several years he has talked the talk in regards to <br/>\n </span></blockquote>unschooling and children learning but when we discuss it now and I <br/>\npoint out what they are learning through their play he says he knows <br/>\nthe talk but he doesn&#39;t believe it and that no matter how I &quot;dress it <br/>\nup&quot; it&#39;s still just play. I need to be teaching them something. <br/>\nSomething needs to change to satisfy his needs or he&#39;ll push the <br/>\nschool at least in the younger ones.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you find some more &quot;educational&quot; stuff to include in their play? Perhaps you could try to find a free online assessment and have your kids take it to show him that they do know stuff. I did that with my oldest once. We were concerned about whether or not she could read and comprehend so we found a free 5 minute assessment thing online and had her take it. While she didn&#39;t score at the level of her schooled peers, it showed us that she was indeed learning something. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I need some help. I don&#39;t want my kids to go to school and neither do <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they but when I ask them to do anything &quot;schooly&quot; even if it&#39;s <br/>\nsomething they enjoy like playing games, they balk - they&#39;re too busy <br/>\ndoing this or watching this show or playing this video game or what <br/>\never it is they are involved in - and they are always involved in <br/>\nsomething! I understand how they feel and hate pushing it and I&#39;m <br/>\nsure they feel that. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHas your husband talked to your kids? It sounds like you might have been filtering everything between your husband and your kids so that they do not value their dad or his opinions. I say this because that is what happened at our house. The kids took their cue from me when it came to their dad. I was so caught up in respecting the kids that I totally ignored my husband and failed to respect him. When I didn&#39;t respect him and his needs, then neither did the kids. We are working on it but there are still times when the kids come to me to tattle on their dad because he was mean to them or yelled at them even though they were in the wrong. Now, I try to encourage my husband to talk to the kids about his concerns. I also try to make the kids talk to their dad rather than being the buffer. If the kids get upset by his concerns, then I try to help them to understand his point of view. Likewise, I try to help him see the kids point of view. Yes, it has become very convoluted but we are trying to unravel it so that my husband is my equal once again rather than somebody that ranks below the kids. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still believe in unschooling and want to respect my kids as much as possible <br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I also need to respect my husband more and I believe our children <br/>\nwill benefit more from us working this out and being together as a <br/>\nfamily more than they will with me holding on to an &quot;ideal&quot; <br/>\nunschooling life and seeing him only every other weekend so any help <br/>\nyou can give would be greatly appreciated.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be way off but it sounds like the underlying issue is one of power. Your husband has no say in anything. Everything is about the kids. I have found that the more I try to respect my husband&#39;s needs, the more helpful he is and the easier it is for him to go along with whatever it is that I am doing. Small things like sleeping next to each other helps. Having a regular meal at the table helps a great deal. Allowing my husband to get pissed off at the kids helps. I was so afraid of trampling on my kids&#39; rights and interests that I had completely emasculated my husband. Every now and then we all have to compromise, including the kids. It sounds like your husband has been the only one that has been compromising and he has reached his end. Of course, all of this is speculation based on what has played out at my house. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula","from":"&quot;Krisula&quot; &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: finding common ground with my husband","postDate":"1262028039","msgId":42584,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhoYjBlNysxMTVwdEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEE2MkM3RDFCLTFCQ0UtNDY2NC04Q0EwLURDMzg4QjEzRTkwNUB3YXJyZW5idXNpbmVzc2Fzc29jaWF0ZXMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":42583,"nextInTopic":42585,"prevInTime":42583,"nextInTime":42585,"topicId":42581,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Perhaps you could ask him for the biggest thing (or maybe three things) that are really bugging him most right this minute.  Maybe it is the sleeping situation?

Sandra Dodd says something very similar in her &quot;Big Book of Unschooling&quot;, which I heartily recommend.<br/>\n   Unschooling can be a big leap for a lot of people, and I encourage you to give yourself, and your family their own growing time, and accept that the &quot;ideal unschooling life&quot; may never happen in your family. This is what I have done, and amazingly, it does seem true that once I let go of the ideal, our family begins moving more in that direction in some ways.<br/>\n   My dh feels the same about bedtimes, and food issues, and I have had to allow him to be the parent in these issues too, and give a little. This has meant me staying up with the kids while he goes to bed, and giving him extra time (if possible), hugs, kisses, attention... and still he negotiates with the kids to get them to bed at a time that he thinks is healthy, and they will be the least grumpy the next day.<br/>\n   I don&#39;t have time to talk about all the issues right now, you can email me at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:justmemomof6@...\">justmemomof6@...</a> if you&#39;d like.<br/>\n   But I can certainly relate. I have 6 children under the age of 13.5, and did not begin unschooling until about 4 years ago. It is a work in progress that I believe in. My changing in parenting issues has led to hurdle after hurdle for our marriage, yet we are committed to keeping together.

Back in June he announced that he&#39;d  <br/>\nhad enough and he was done so he started living elsewhere and asking  <br/>\nfor a divorce.  This was a complete shock for me (still is after so  <br/>\nmany months).  We&#39;ve been talking and I&#39;ve been trying to figure out  <br/>\nwhat the f---!!!  Over these months he&#39;s attempted to explained his  <br/>\npoint of view to me.  Aside from issues between he and I are the  <br/>\nissues of the kids which he equated to being &quot;the last straw.&quot;  He&#39;s  <br/>\ndone with unschooling - all of it.  He sees things differently than I  <br/>\ndo.  For example he sees the children as getting everything they want,  <br/>\nwhenever they want and however they want.  I know this isn&#39;t true and  <br/>\nI believe on some level he knows it to but he&#39;s very frustrated with  <br/>\nmany things and feels he&#39;s been put on the back burner so to speak and  <br/>\nthe kids have taken over.  There are 5 of them and they are young and  <br/>\nyes they are alot of work and can be overwhelming and (not that I&#39;m  <br/>\ntaking all the blame here so don&#39;t worry) but he is right - to a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some of the problems:<br/>\n<br/>\nHe feels they are too young to make their own choices in regards to  <br/>\nfood - that here (at home) they only eat candy and junk and that they  <br/>\neat all day long and we&#39;re short order cooks.  He would like to see  <br/>\nset meal plans and times - not necessarily strict - breakfast is  <br/>\nserved at 8, lunch at 12 and dinner at 6 with no exceptions, but much  <br/>\nless short order cooking so that our entire day isn&#39;t spent cooking  <br/>\nindividual meals.  Even as I type that sentence I&#39;m struck by the  <br/>\nhumor of it - if all they ate was candy and other junk how am I  <br/>\ncooking in the kitchen all day?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe thinks the kids should be in bed at a &quot;decent time&quot; and get up at a  <br/>\n&quot;decent time.&quot;  He hasn&#39;t said what that time is but I think generally  <br/>\nthey should be in bed by 10 and up around 8 or 9, I think.  He is  <br/>\nlegally blind and doesn&#39;t drive so the sleeping and waking is  <br/>\nparticularly irksome because he can&#39;t come and go as he needs, he is  <br/>\ndependent on us to drive him back and forth to work and the kids are  <br/>\ntoo young to stay by themselves and they don&#39;t want to stay by  <br/>\nthemselves.  So if they don&#39;t get up till 11 then he can&#39;t get to work  <br/>\nuntil 12 or so.  He is self employed but all of his equipment is at  <br/>\nhis office so he needs to be at his office and he deals with people  <br/>\nfrom all over who deal in &quot;business time&quot; so he would like to be in  <br/>\nthe office before 12. His office is a single wide trailer which is  <br/>\nwhere he&#39;s been living.  He&#39;s been getting up around 5 - exercising,  <br/>\neating, showering, e-mailing, working all before we even roll over  <br/>\naround 9.  We&#39;ve had a driver for him in the past who picked him up  <br/>\naround 8:30 but he&#39;s gotten so he really likes getting up early and  <br/>\ngetting moving.  We have always co-slept and now have 2 king sized  <br/>\nbeds put together and we all sleep in the bed together so he and I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t slept near each other in years because there is always a kid  <br/>\nor 2 between us and he would like for them to sleep in their own beds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also feels I should be teaching them something, which is where I  <br/>\nneed some suggestions.  Our 9 year old doesn&#39;t read at all.  Our 7  <br/>\nyear old dabbles in it.  He feels like when he agreed to all of this  <br/>\nhe agreed to homeschooling - even relaxed homeschooling - not  <br/>\nunschooling.  He feels like we haven&#39;t been doing anything in regards  <br/>\nto teaching our children.  He believes all they do is play video  <br/>\ngames, watch TV, play make-believe games, play with their friends etc.  <br/>\nbut no &quot;structured&quot; anything.  I believe in unschooling and know they  <br/>\nare learning and will learn to do whatever when they are ready.  He  <br/>\nbelieves we are doing a great disservice to our children.   He wants  <br/>\nto put them in school.  He believes although I am a certified teacher  <br/>\nI have become complacent and lazy and can&#39;t teach them.  That with the  <br/>\n5 of them and their needs I can&#39;t keep up and get done what needs to  <br/>\nbe done in the home and with schooling.  In his words, &quot;If we&#39;d been  <br/>\nschooling them at least some the older ones would be able to help  <br/>\nteach the younger ones and do more independent stuff while I was  <br/>\nnursing the baby to sleep or fixing food or whatever.&quot;  He thinks all  <br/>\nI want to do is play with them and be their friend, not their parent.   <br/>\nOver the last several years he has talked the talk in regards to  <br/>\nunschooling and children learning but when we discuss it now and I  <br/>\npoint out what they are learning through their play he says he knows  <br/>\nthe talk but he doesn&#39;t believe it and that no matter how I &quot;dress it  <br/>\nup&quot; it&#39;s still just play.  I need to be teaching them something.   <br/>\nSomething needs to change to satisfy his needs or he&#39;ll push the  <br/>\nschool at least in the younger ones.  He realizes that to put Nicholas  <br/>\nin school would be very traumatic - testing, special needs classrooms,  <br/>\npossible drug intervention to calm him, - he&#39;s a very active kids and  <br/>\nwould be in 4th grade where reading is so crucial in the school  <br/>\nsetting, there&#39;s no way he&#39;d be able to function in a 4th grade  <br/>\nclass.  He believes that Alessandra would adapt and that Dominic would  <br/>\nbe okay because he&#39;d only be in kindergarten and Carmella would go to  <br/>\nday care, I mean pre-school, so she would be able to be on track  <br/>\nwithout any intervention.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some help.  I don&#39;t want my kids to go to school and neither do  <br/>\nthey but when I ask them to do anything &quot;schooly&quot; even if it&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething they enjoy like playing games, they balk  - they&#39;re too busy  <br/>\ndoing this or watching this show or playing this video game or what  <br/>\never it is they are involved in - and they are always involved in  <br/>\nsomething!  I understand how they feel and hate pushing it and I&#39;m  <br/>\nsure they feel that.  But if we don&#39;t start doing something, showing  <br/>\nsome progress in &quot;learning&quot; he&#39;s going to put them in school.  And  <br/>\nwhen the kids and I talk about the options they want to do what it  <br/>\ntakes so they don&#39;t have to go to school but when it comes right down  <br/>\nto it they protest.  So how can I &quot;teach them something&quot; in a way that  <br/>\nthey will want to participate without me yelling and screaming or  <br/>\nthreatening them if we don&#39;t do this, you will end up in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know several of you IRL and many of you know my husband, I want this  <br/>\nto work out between us and don&#39;t want a divorce.

I still  <br/>\nbelieve in unschooling and want to respect my kids as much as possible  <br/>\nbut I also need to respect my husband more and I believe our children  <br/>\nwill benefit more from us working this out and being together as a  <br/>\nfamily more than they will with me holding on to an &quot;ideal&quot;  <br/>\nunschooling life and seeing him only every other weekend so any help  <br/>\nyou can give would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn, wife to Christopher, mother to Nicholas (9), Alessandra (7),  <br/>\nDominic (6), Carmella (3) and Francesca (1)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42571,"nextTopicId":42625}}
