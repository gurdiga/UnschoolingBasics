Anyway, I posted the video on a local AP list I&#39;m on, as well as a little blurb about the freedom we give our girls around food, and now some moms are asking for more resources, reading, etc. about the topic.  Aside from the unschooling lists, which I don&#39;t think is really what they&#39;re looking for, does anyone have suggestions?

He has a hard time accepting empirical evidence, as he is a <br/>\nscientist (well, that&#39;s waht he says &lt;g&gt;). Kohn is good to give a <br/>\nmore masculine approach. I think John Holt&#39;s stuff would appeal if I <br/>\ncan mine out the &#39;gems&#39;. He doesn&#39;t like reading much (dh), so while <br/>\nI am a voracious reader with fiction and non-fiction of all types on <br/>\nthe go, he doesn&#39;t tend to look further than the way he was parented. <br/>\nIn actual fact, he has toned down a lot at my request - he had been <br/>\nraised with some pretty punitive methods.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe you can help him see that unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>offer guidance.

Dh often says to me he couldn&#39;t have the <br/>\namount of patience as I do (which makes me laugh, because I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I&#39;m especially patient. I HAVE learned that going through a <br/>\nprocess wholeheartedly to the end takes just as long as trying to <br/>\nsupress or deny a child&#39;s reality and usually achieves more learning <br/>\nfor both of us &lt;g&gt; ).<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What does your husband mean by self discipline?

What is his worry?  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Look for articles or posts that address his specific concerns.  At <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  articles are <br/>\nlisted by topic and you might find just the thing there.  Joyce <br/>\nFetteroll has a really nice website too, www.joyfullyrejoycing.com <br/>\nsame deal, you can scroll through until you find the topic of <br/>\ninterest.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>^^^^^^^ He means that the parents &#39;discipline&#39; the child, by <br/>\nimposing &quot;consequences&quot;, with warnings of said consequences, such as <br/>\ntime outs, removing priviledges, etc. This then causes the child <br/>\nto &quot;get into the habit of doing the right thing&quot;. Eventually, they <br/>\nwill transfer this framework internally, to develop &quot;self-control&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; People will eventually sleep when they&#39;re tired&lt;g&gt;.  There&#39;s no way <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to get around it.  Lot&#39;s of adults have to juggle their sleep <br/>\nschedule to meet their work schedule, doctors, nurses, patrolmen, <br/>\nnight shifters and swing shifters.  A healthy sleep schedule will <br/>\nmean something different to each person and will probably change <br/>\nseveral times during one&#39;s lifetime.   Kids who get to experiment a <br/>\nlot at home with sleeping and waking and staying up late and staying <br/>\nup round the clock are getting lots of information about how sleep or <br/>\ntoo little sleep makes them feel.  You can&#39;t really learn good sleep <br/>\nhabits (whatever that is) by someone telling you how much sleep you <br/>\nshould have and when it should start and when it should end.  You can <br/>\nonly gain that information by experience.  It&#39;s a myth that everyone <br/>\nneeds the same amount of sleep and sleep needs can change depending <br/>\non hormones, season, stress, health, growth, activity...   <br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^All of which I have seen to be true when dh is not here and the <br/>\nchildren regulate their bedtimes in accordance with what they want to <br/>\ndo (or not) the following day. I am constantly amazed and delighted <br/>\nby how the kids live up to the trust placed in them and this, to me, <br/>\nis the living proof of an RU lifestyle. But then, I see it and dh, <br/>\nlooking at the same children, doesn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Find out what your husband means by a good work ethic.   My husband <br/>\n </span></blockquote>thought it meant going to work on time every day and doing a good <br/>\njob.  The other part of what he did was complain a lot about his co <br/>\nworkers, his job, his boss, his schedule... He thought he was being a <br/>\ngood example by going to work every day but he was really sending the <br/>\nmessage that work was horrible.  Ask your husband to describe to you <br/>\nwhat a good work ethic is and then pay attention to how he talks <br/>\nabout work in front of the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^^Good idea. I also find dh talks a lot about &quot;getting the boring <br/>\nstuff over and done with&quot; in relation to chores. He puts out quite a <br/>\ndifferent vibe when thar&#39;s workin&#39; to be done, which I find hard to <br/>\nadapt to when I have been used to being more relaxed with the kids <br/>\nand allowing a bit more ebb and flow around tasks and lots of <br/>\nattention on relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; People are respectful if they grow up receiving respect.  There&#39;s <br/>\n </span></blockquote>no magic to it.  The reason kids in school have special classes now <br/>\nto *teach* respect is because those kids don&#39;t receive respect and <br/>\nhave no idea of it&#39;s value.  *Teaching* respect won&#39;t work, the <br/>\nschools will continue to have problems with kids.   In your home, <br/>\nwhere you and your partner respect each other and where your kids are <br/>\ntreated respectfully, the kid will be able to see the value of <br/>\nrespect and will have lots of experience.  They&#39;ll be full of respect <br/>\nif you fill them with it.  They&#39;ll be respect-full &lt;g&gt; and will be <br/>\nable to show it to others. <br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^Yep....<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have family members from different cultural and religious <br/>\n </span></blockquote>backgrounds so we have talked a lot about what respect means to <br/>\ndifferent family members.   <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe if you talk more with your husband about what good manners <br/>\n </span></blockquote>look like to him and then talk about the ways your kids have and will <br/>\ncontinue to learn about manners he&#39;ll see that the kids will be <br/>\ngetting guidance from you both,  all along.   We were going to visit <br/>\nsome folks we haven&#39;t seen in awhile and I told Dylan, &quot;They&#39;ll <br/>\nexpect us to take our shoes off when we go in.&quot;   At home we take our <br/>\nshoes of when we want but not as a matter of routine for keeping the <br/>\nfloors clean, so I thought he&#39;d want that information, and want it <br/>\nbefore we got there in case he wanted to make a choice about which <br/>\nshoes or socks to wear. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n^^^^Totally agree. The problem is when dh, mostly in relation to his <br/>\nfamily, doesn&#39;t simply supply this information, but try and convince <br/>\nthe children of it&#39;s inherant &#39;rightness&#39;.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Study skills?

He came away more &quot;radical&quot; than I was.

He loved that they loved being<br/>\nthere with their families and socializing with the younger kids and the<br/>\nadults, that they often looked different (lots of punk type get-ups), and<br/>\nthat they seemed to have it so together.  He went to a couple of panel<br/>\nsessions with teens and learned that they were doing just fine in life.  He<br/>\nalso figured out that there&#39;s a lot less rebellion as a whole in the<br/>\npopulation of unschooled teens.

I know people who&#39;s ex&#39;s have taking them to court over the schooling issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone here read the Eckhart Tolle books - The New Earth and The Power of Now - I think it&#39;s maybe unfortunate that thewse books are on Oprah and all that because it may lead people to dismiss them as too mainstream, whatever - I think they are really excellent and their popularity may lead some people *not* to read them :-{  anyway, the books are about the nature of human consciousness - they are very buddhist really - he is talking about how we can free ourselves from what he calls the &quot;egoic&quot; mind - reactiveness and such - I have found these ideas to be a *huge* help when dealing with all these issues - they have helped me to find some peace and solidness with the idea that I am doing stuff with my children that my family of origin and my husband all think is wrong - that is a very hard thing to live with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, anyway, goodl luck in your own struggles - I know it is not easy, all the housework issues, the worry about whether it is the right thing when people around you are saying it is wrong, and all the regular marriage issues thrown in - hopefully being able to let it all out on this list will help!

My wife has <br/>\n  been <br/>\n  &gt; the cart driver in our journey toward unschooling and I am not sure <br/>\n  &gt; if she considers herself completely a RU. She does operate in a <br/>\n  very <br/>\n  &gt; similar way.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I had a difficult time accepting unschooling as a healthy <br/>\n  alternative <br/>\n  &gt; to public school. My wife seemed to have a negative attitude <br/>\n  towards <br/>\n  &gt; public school and that affected the way that I viewed unschooling. <br/>\n  I <br/>\n  &gt; had some great experiences in school and had some real good <br/>\n  teachers. <br/>\n  &gt; I did have some difficulties and begged my parents at one time to <br/>\n  let <br/>\n  &gt; me home school (it was a social issue, I did not like some of the <br/>\n  &gt; other children and the way that they emulated their parents) to no <br/>\n  &gt; avail.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; My wife did not try to force me to accept unschooling; she was in <br/>\n  &gt; charge of raising the children because I was unsure of how to be a <br/>\n  &gt; good parent. My parents were of the disciplinarian/punishment <br/>\n  &gt; persuasion and deep down I knew that to be the wrong path. I <br/>\n  thought <br/>\n  &gt; that spanking was alright in the context of loving and caring. Boy <br/>\n  &gt; was I WRONG on that! I think back to those times and can not <br/>\n  believe <br/>\n  &gt; that I was that person. My training and personal experience with <br/>\n  &gt; teaching myself to play music and do anything that interested in me <br/>\n  &gt; came from much rehearsal and rigid practice. SO... I came to <br/>\n  believe <br/>\n  &gt; that for my children to learn they HAD to practice in order to <br/>\n  learn <br/>\n  &gt; anything and thus the disciplinarian in me was raising its unwanted <br/>\n  &gt; head. My oldest child would just shut me out whenever I would try <br/>\n  to <br/>\n  &gt; convince her to practice anything. This was frustrating for me; I <br/>\n  &gt; wanted to share what I knew and teach her how to do things that <br/>\n  &gt; interested me. There is the problem right there. I wanted her to do <br/>\n  &gt; what I wanted. Not what she wanted. That was the hurdle that took <br/>\n  me <br/>\n  &gt; so long to get over. I wanted to do what I thought was appropriate <br/>\n  as <br/>\n  &gt; a parent so that my children could be what I had interpreted to be <br/>\n  &gt; acceptable people in society. My notions were based on very common <br/>\n  &gt; types of thinking and thoughts that are difficult for me to <br/>\n  &gt; comprehend in a healthy life affirming loving natural way. I was <br/>\n  &gt; terribly bogged down with negative thinking, I knew that I could <br/>\n  &gt; predict how things would go and could help force them into <br/>\n  existence <br/>\n  &gt; by focusing on them even to the point of obsession always to the <br/>\n  &gt; least favorable outcome. <br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; Getting past my negative way of looking at life has taken many <br/>\n  years <br/>\n  &gt; and even now I am still just emerging from the depths of doom. I <br/>\n  have <br/>\n  &gt; been rejected so many times by my wife when I wanted to force teach <br/>\n  &gt; or discipline. Every volley lobbed her way she managed to smash <br/>\n  back <br/>\n  &gt; at me. She remained strong no matter how much what I was doing was <br/>\n  &gt; hurting her and our children. She has fought the good fight and <br/>\n  &gt; thanks to her I am now on her team and we are playing together. But <br/>\n  &gt; it has been a long and painful road. I do not want to discourage <br/>\n  you <br/>\n  &gt; at the prospect of how much work it will take for your husband to <br/>\n  get <br/>\n  &gt; on board with you and RU but it truly is up to him to understand <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; make the decision to change his way of thinking. When I hit rock <br/>\n  &gt; bottom with my struggles to get my way and came to realize that I <br/>\n  &gt; would never succeed in forcing my family to do it my way. I read <br/>\n  for <br/>\n  &gt; the first time &quot;How children fail&quot; by John Holt, the truth that I <br/>\n  &gt; discovered from John Holt is that empowering children and freeing <br/>\n  &gt; them to make their own decisions and be the people that they are <br/>\n  &gt; without interference has a greater impact on how they develop than <br/>\n  &gt; trying to cookie cutter them into the people that traditional <br/>\n  &gt; parenting and schooling would have them be. It was a realization <br/>\n  that <br/>\n  &gt; helped me understand how I was programmed by the school system to <br/>\n  &gt; accept and tow the party line for the good of the order. I came to <br/>\n  &gt; understand how my spirit had been broken by competition in school <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; the demands of social interaction with people that knew mostly how <br/>\n  to <br/>\n  &gt; look out for themselves and step on anyone that got in the way. <br/>\n  This <br/>\n  &gt; led me to look into my past and discover what I was afraid of in <br/>\n  &gt; letting go of my selfish way of thinking. I discovered many <br/>\n  previous <br/>\n  &gt; events that caused me great agony to revisit but I let them heal in <br/>\n  &gt; me and now have moved forward from that person that I was.<br/>\n  &gt; I am trying to be as brief as I can and give a full representation <br/>\n  of <br/>\n  &gt; what it took for me to accept the unschooling philosophy and daily <br/>\n  &gt; practice. I have been unschooling myself my whole life I had not <br/>\n  &gt; realized it before now and I want to share it with my children and <br/>\n  by <br/>\n  &gt; my example of happy inner feelings that well up inside of me and <br/>\n  help <br/>\n  &gt; me float above the daily grind of having to go to work every day <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; do the dumb things I gotta do that they will benefit from a father <br/>\n  &gt; that loves, lives and gives into to positive thinking as opposed to <br/>\n  &gt; daddy downer.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I know that if people are to be happy it is up to them to decide to <br/>\n  &gt; be happy and not pushed into happiness. I hope that my experience <br/>\n  &gt; will help you on your journey with the simple fact that people can <br/>\n  &gt; change and I am an example of a very stubborn person who has made a <br/>\n  &gt; life changing transformation for the good of his family.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; johnny<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;elendil722003&quot; <br/>\n  &gt; &lt;chis31@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Hi all, <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I have lurked here for about a year now.

My two kids and I eagerly grasped <br/>\n  &gt; Natural <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Learning and since then we have had a slow but sure journey <br/>\n  towards <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; RU. I have to give so much credit to my beautiful children <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; for &#39;knowing&#39; and I am so glad to feel I can follow my heart and <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; embrace RU.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Okay, now the tricky bit - my husband is not in the same place <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; I <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; want to respect him and where he is, without compromising how my <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; journey is going. We still have times where he &#39;sets&#39; work for <br/>\n  the <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; kids, or expresses a lot of fears about the way I am &#39;teaching&#39; <br/>\n  &gt; them -<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; or not, as he often sees it, lol.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Being an instinctual person kind of discovering that this is okay <br/>\n  &gt; at <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; the age of 35, I still feel incredibly vulnerable in the face of <br/>\n  &gt; his <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; need to work it all out in long debates with me. I often just <br/>\n  &gt; crumple <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; emotionally in these situations, which is quite embarressing to <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; admit, because in my capacity of a volunteer for my home ed <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; organisation, I answer enquiries, run courses and info workshops, <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; etc. I feel much more comfortable reassuring other people&#39;s <br/>\n  family <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; members, of course!<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right <br/>\n  &gt; because <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; it makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming <br/>\n  the <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; authentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration <br/>\n  and <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; boundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be. (And I <br/>\n  &gt; agree <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; with others here - they do NOT go wild, because I don&#39;t try and <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; control and guide them and orchestrate &#39;learning&#39; for them and I <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; haven&#39;t noticed any delinquency yet - in fact much less of a need <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; to &#39;rebel&#39;).<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Can anyone offer suggestions or share experiences of how they <br/>\n  began <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; to fit into the RU paradigm in a way that enabled them to stop <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; feeling defensive, or &#39;wierd&#39; - I even suddenly feel odd even <br/>\n  with <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; home ed friends who say stuff like - &quot;well, they&#39;ve GOT to have <br/>\n  &gt; some <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; limits and shouldn&#39;t they help you around the house?&quot;. Or &quot;well <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; you&#39;re kids are older now (8 and 12), so they can be trusted with <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; more freedom. With little kids, parents just know more, have the <br/>\n  &gt; life <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; experience to help them make healthy choices&quot;.<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; I have been blessed that my kids are pretty good with helping <br/>\n  &gt; anyway, <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; but I am finding there is less getting done as I completely <br/>\n  release <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; them of ANY coercion to help. I know I could appeal to their good <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; nature at any time if I said I was feeling overwhelmed and they <br/>\n  &gt; would <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; jump into it, but I want to even past that and look at what would <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; happen if I released MYSELF from that experience. And I am NOT <br/>\n  the <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; best housekeeper in the world - but, I don&#39;t WANT to feel <br/>\n  &gt; overwhelmed <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; by tasks. I have been charactersied by some of my nearest and <br/>\n  &gt; dearest <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; that I am disorganised, easily distracted, out all the time with <br/>\n  &gt; the <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; kids, having fun, etc. <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; (sorry - tearful moment - my eight year old just rang me on the <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; mobile phone on her walk with the dog to the end of the street. <br/>\n  She <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; said &quot;I don&#39;t want you to worry Mum, but I am walking really <br/>\n  &gt; slowly, <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; so I will take longer to get back, okay?&quot;. Who says children <br/>\n  aren&#39;t <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; trustworthy and responsible people....awwww).<br/>\n  &gt; &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; Yes, so how do I embrace my own stuff and not miss the joy in the <br/>\n  &gt; day <br/>\n  &gt; &gt; when I see &#39;mess&#39;?

I came to <br/>\nunderstand how my spirit had been broken by competition in school and <br/>\nthe demands of social interaction with people that knew mostly how to <br/>\nlook out for themselves and step on anyone that got in the way. This <br/>\nled me to look into my past and discover what I was afraid of in <br/>\nletting go of my selfish way of thinking. I discovered many previous <br/>\nevents that caused me great agony to revisit but I let them heal in <br/>\nme and now have moved forward from that person that I was.<br/>\nI am trying to be as brief as I can and give a full representation of <br/>\nwhat it took for me to accept the unschooling philosophy and daily <br/>\npractice. I have been unschooling myself my whole life I had not <br/>\nrealized it before now and I want to share it with my children and by <br/>\nmy example of happy inner feelings that well up inside of me and help <br/>\nme float above the daily grind of having to go to work every day and <br/>\ndo the dumb things I gotta do that they will benefit from a father <br/>\nthat loves, lives and gives into to positive thinking as opposed to <br/>\ndaddy downer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that if people are to be happy it is up to them to decide to <br/>\nbe happy and not pushed into happiness. I hope that my experience <br/>\nwill help you on your journey with the simple fact that people can <br/>\nchange and I am an example of a very stubborn person who has made a <br/>\nlife changing transformation for the good of his family.<br/>\n<br/>\njohnny<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;elendil722003&quot; <br/>\n&lt;chis31@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi all, <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have lurked here for about a year now.

My husband didn&#39;t want to read a whole book but he&#39;d read a post over morning coffee.  Anything written by Pam Sorooshian made sense to him.&lt;g&gt;   Give him things to read that will appeal to him.  If the touchy, feely stuff you like won&#39;t do it, don&#39;t give him that stuff.   <br/>\n<br/>\nRead more yourself so that you gain confidence.   Think of his questions as concerns and not attacks.  He has a right to know his kids are ok.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe write down what the kids are doing, what you talk about, what they read or what you read to them or what they watch, what games they play so that he can see they&#39;re doing something with their time.  Give him a model to replace the school model he has in his head.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRemind him he trusts you.  He trusted you to take care of helpless babies and now he can trust you to take care of your bigger kids.  Reassure him you&#39;re not going to do anything that will hurt them.  Let him see you&#39;re a thinking person too so he can have some confidence in you. <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do I explain to a logical person that I feel RU is right because<br/>\nit makes my heart sing, it helps me to feel like I am becoming the<br/>\nauthentic me and that it is freeing my kids up from frustration and<br/>\nboundaries and releasing them to be who they need to be.***<br/>\n<br/>\nBy recognizing that sounds *CRAZY* to a logical person so you&#39;ll have to give him more than that.&lt;g&gt;   Some people *feel* the earth is flat, that doesn&#39;t make it so.&lt;g&gt;   If you already know he won&#39;t be reassured by your singing heart, give him what *he* needs.   There are logical reasons unschooling makes sense.  There are well documented problems with mainstream education and public schooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of times Joyce Fetteroll has used the analogy of a religious cult.  If your husband wanted to get the kids involved in some weird religion would it reassure you if he told you the reason he thought it would be good for the kids is because it made his heart sing?   You&#39;d want more information and reassurance than that, I&#39;m sure.   I know if my dh ever said something like that to me his singing heart would be quivering on the floor with a fork stuck in it. And not a tuning fork either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGet and read the John Holt books.  Unschooling lists today will give you more immediate help with modern unschooling but those books make the problems of schooling very clear.  They make a strong argument for natural learning.    <br/>\n<br/>\n***Can anyone offer suggestions or share experiences of how they began<br/>\nto fit into the RU paradigm in a way that enabled them to stop<br/>\nfeeling defensive, or &#39;wierd&#39; ***  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to &quot;fit into&quot; a new way of thinking.  You either think a certain way or you don&#39;t.  When you know what you think, and if you&#39;re thinking well, you won&#39;t feel insecure. &quot;Fit into&quot; sounds like you&#39;re trying something on, and if you don&#39;t know how it fits how do you expect folks around you to know it fits?  Read more.  Listen to your husband&#39;s concerns and address them.  The more you know the more confident you&#39;ll feel.  There&#39;s no magic.    <br/>\n<br/>\n*** When my husband says it&#39;s not fair of me to keep<br/>\nthe house in disorder at times, that I should compromise, what do I<br/>\nsay without starting world war three? ***<br/>\n<br/>\n  *** Am I being disrespectful of HIS needs<br/>\nfor order, or is it something he needs to work out on his own?***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s his house too, if he needs it more orderly then do what you can to meet his need.  Does he get a day off?  Would he be willing to spend a couple hours helping you clean? Would he take the kids to the park so you can clean?   Can you hire someone to come in once a week and clean?   Can you take a half hour before he gets home to tidy up?  Get up before the kids do and clean house then?  Stay up later than the kids and clean house?   I don&#39;t know what will work for your family but something will.  Find ways to make cleaning up easier.  Get better organized.   Make some cookies and ask a couple of friends to come over and help you organize one room.  Ask for ideas from a friend who&#39;s house keeping skills you admire.   Look at what works for other people and see if some of it might work for your home. <br/>\n<br/>\n***How do I change my<br/>\ndefensiveness and extend RU relating to him and others who are okay<br/>\nabout critiquing my journey? ***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more confident you become the more you&#39;ll be ok with the fact other people get to think what they want. &lt;g&gt;  Learn as much about unschooling and natural learning as you can.  Learn some of the arguments against mainstream education and public schooling and see if they seem valid to you.    Learn what others are concerned about regarding your choice and see if there&#39;s anything to it and if there is, address that.  If, after you&#39;ve considered it carefully there&#39;s nothing to their concerns, then let it go.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour husband deserves special consideration though.  He cares about his kids and you&#39;re stepping way outside his comfort zone.  Help him get comfortable with what you&#39;re doing by being more confident, more informed, more able to address his concerns and more sensitive to his needs.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to get him to a place where he agrees with you entirely.  Help him get comfortable knowing you won&#39;t do anything to hurt his kids.  Help him go along with you comfortably.  That might not be your ideal but it&#39;s worked well for many of us. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Wanting to be radical, lol.","postDate":"1210950382","msgId":32916,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQTg1N0Q4OTZDMjIwMS1CQzgtOTg4QFdFQk1BSUwtTUIwOS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGcwaXZwbytrNDUzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGcwaXZwbytrNDUzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":32915,"nextInTopic":32917,"prevInTime":32915,"nextInTime":32917,"topicId":32888,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
