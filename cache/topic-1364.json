Initially, I wanted it there for folks that had taken <br/>\nmy creativity workshop here in Pensacola, but realized it would just <br/>\nbe nice to have a safe place on the web in which we can explore our <br/>\ncreative genius selves!:)<br/>\nSince unschoolers are such creative individuals anyway, I thought <br/>\nI&#39;d share it with you all, maybe a few of you will feel a need for <br/>\nthat kind of support.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re a repressed creative, yearning to break out of your shell, <br/>\nor a fully creative genius exploring freely, I hope you&#39;ll join me <br/>\nand create a wonderful list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is the group description:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Imagination tribe is a group of people, interested in supporting <br/>\none another in our creative endeavors. Whether you&#39;re a repressed <br/>\ncreative, yearning to express yourself, or a successful <br/>\nartist/writer/dreamer/entrepreneur, join us as we discuss issues <br/>\nthat pertain to thinking, living and seeing more creatively.<br/>\nThis group has been started as a base of support for those that have <br/>\ntaken the &quot;Awakening the Dragon&quot; creativity workshop in Pensacola, <br/>\nbut is open to all creative souls, seeking other imaginative spirits <br/>\nfor support and idea sharing.<br/>\nThis is a safe place to share your dreams and goals. We ask that all <br/>\ninformation and advice will be shared in a spirit of friendship and <br/>\ntrue desire to enable one another. New members will be moderated to <br/>\nensure a supportive atmosphere. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the only one there so far...because I haven&#39;t done my workshop <br/>\nhere yet. So it looks rather lonely right now.:) After I get my <br/>\nbusiness up and running and do the workshop a few times, I expect it <br/>\nto get more lively!<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1353,"nextTopicId":1343}}
