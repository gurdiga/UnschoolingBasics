I have taken some of everything, and now I have archives <br/>\nfor the future. So the sleep problems aren&#39;t baby-related, they&#39;re from <br/>\nDD. She had peacefully, gradually and successfully transferred into her <br/>\nown bed in her own room at about 2 years old. She started have sleep <br/>\nproblems about three weeks ago, and sleeping with all four us in the <br/>\nqueen sized bed has not been getting anyone enough sleep, so we&#39;re <br/>\nworking figuring out better arrangements. Mostly it&#39;s about me <br/>\nreconnecting/reassuring her during the day. We&#39;re figuring it out though :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I posted we went to the mall (for an entirely differently <br/>\nreason....to fix the phone I had broken). It was DD&#39;s idea actually. <br/>\nWhen we got home, my husband was home (about two hours early) because he <br/>\nknew  how stressed I sounded. I went for a 15 minute walk by myself, and <br/>\nwhen I came back DH made dinner with the baby in the sling, and DD and I <br/>\nplayed on the trampoline, picked up the loose (empty) bee hives in the <br/>\nyard (don&#39;t ask), and played &quot;Oh no the Giants are Going to Get Us We <br/>\nHave to Run Far Far Away&quot; until it got dark out. Excellent reconnection. <br/>\nWhen I asked DD about her favorite part of the day and the thing she <br/>\nwould most like to do differently in the future (part of our standard <br/>\nbed time routine) she didn&#39;t even mention my &quot;hissy fit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day, we dropped everything and invited a friend to go blueberry <br/>\npicking. Another excellent day where I just relaxed.

I&#39;m tired and cranky because none of us are getting enough sleep, I&#39;m eating crap, and I&#39;m not exercising. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, it sounds like you&#39;ve identified some triggers already.....the sleep issue might not be something you can do much about with a little one, but you can choose to eat better and maybe take some walks with your little ones to get some fresh air and exercise. I find that getting outside and walking can really change the atomosphere when things get tense. The little ones can always find neat things to look at and observe whether you&#39;re in the city or country. Srap that baby to your body and GO.:)<br/>\nAnother good distractor when things are tense and I need a break, is pulling out some toys we&#39;ve had put away for a while, or some dollar store goodies I keep stashed (new pens, books, dolls, games etc...)<br/>\nNew food is another good distractor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I&#39;m wondering, is are you stating your feelings honestly to your child? It sounds like you&#39;re playing this Wizard of Oz when you really don&#39;t want to...that isn&#39;t being honest and might be building up resentment for you. If you really don&#39;t want to do something, tell her and offer some other choices. Use creative problem solving to find a middle ground. Negotiation doesn&#39;t mean discussing until one person gives in, it means trying to come to a common ground, or find a solution you can BOTH live with.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve got a lot to deal with just having a wee babe in arms....it takes a lot of prevention to take care of yourself and still give your older child what they need. And when you feel totally overwhelmed with nothing left to give, just know that others have felt the same way, that all is well and you&#39;re not going to have these feelings forever. Try to picture that little one as a teenager and just suck up every sweet moment while they&#39;re little.:)<br/>\nReading stories while cuddled up, or movies/tv is a great way to give an older child something interesting, while you can hold and nurse the baby. Use all the tools  you&#39;ve got!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I thought of, is myself in these situations. I tend to start feeling the stress and I bury it until I&#39;m a ticking time bomb. It&#39;s important to state your needs and desires before it gets to that point. WE are responsible to head this off at the pass, our families can&#39;t read our minds. I&#39;m sure you know all of this, but sometimes we all need a reminder to speak up and state our needs loudly.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn about unschooling at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195021197,"authorName":"becky_2765","from":"&quot;becky_2765&quot; &lt;becky_2765@...&gt;","profile":"becky_2765","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: First time Filing","postDate":"1092291769","msgId":2710,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmZjJicCthbjEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzZDIwMWM0N2ZkYiRiZTg0M2ZjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4="},"prevInTopic":2707,"nextInTopic":2711,"prevInTime":2709,"nextInTime":2711,"topicId":2700,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Without getting into <br/>\nspecifics, I didn&#39;t get my way and I had a fit. I&#39;m having such a hard <br/>\ntime trying to feel the joy with my daughter. I&#39;m sick of playing Wizard <br/>\nof Oz, I&#39;m tired of &quot;negotiations&quot; that end up feeling like I don&#39;t get <br/>\nmy needs met, and I feel like a total failure as a parent. I&#39;m tired and <br/>\ncranky because none of us are getting enough sleep, I&#39;m eating crap, and <br/>\nI&#39;m not exercising. (My problems, I know, not my daughter&#39;s). In short, <br/>\nI&#39;m somewhat depressed. Late baby blues from my 4 month old? I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow. My sister called in the middle of it and told me that my problem <br/>\nwas that I negotiate too much with my daughter and that she needs to <br/>\nlearn that my priorities (to go to the mall and get out of the house) <br/>\nare her priorities, and if I carry her kicking and screaming to the car, <br/>\nshe&#39;ll get over it and she&#39;ll end up having a good time once we get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DON&#39;T WANT TO DO THAT!!!  So, even though I f-ed up today by having my <br/>\nhissy fit, I&#39;m not so far gone that I&#39;m taking that &quot;advice&quot;.

I was looking around the house<br/>\nand instead of seeing &quot;messes&quot;, I was seeing &quot;play spots&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;experiements&quot;.  I realized how much more relaxed my own feelings and<br/>\nattitude about cleanup have gotten, and how I really only bother entering<br/>\ninto negotiations on the big messes anymore.  I think the key is what Ren<br/>\nkeeps saying about how if you put your focus on joy, everything else falls<br/>\ninto place.  I was sort of wondering how that worked exactly.  Now I see<br/>\nthat I have spent so much time recently focusing on my kids and my<br/>\nenjoyment, our relationships, our connections, that I just haven&#39;t even felt<br/>\nthe need to be bothered about ways to get cooperation if they don&#39;t feel<br/>\nlike helping on the smaller stuff (which they often do, but if they don&#39;t so<br/>\nwhat?).  It&#39;s just too much energy, and I realized that I&#39;ve become even<br/>\nmore sensitive to interrupting their playing, thinking, pondering,<br/>\nwondering, well, just their day - all that other stuff that they&#39;re doing<br/>\nthat seems more important than cleaning up or worrying if they make a mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a hallmark moment for me came when my daughter, who has picked up on<br/>\nmy own cues and tends to think a lot about &quot;messes&quot;, mirrored my new more<br/>\nrelaxed attitude by taking a page from her brother&#39;s page and smearing some<br/>\napplesauce I thought she was eating all over the TV tray.  I said curiously<br/>\n&quot;What are you doing?&quot;  She said &quot;An experiment&quot;, and I thought, &quot;All right!<br/>\nThank goodness I haven&#39;t made you too crazy about making a mess to<br/>\nexperiment.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am so thankful for this list.  It&#39;s amazing to me that this happened<br/>\nwithout my even being conscious of it until recently.  This really did feel<br/>\nlike it &quot;fell into place&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] First time Filing","postDate":"1092253523","msgId":2701,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAzZDIwMWM0N2ZkYiRiZTg0M2ZjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBsaXZpbmdyb29tMT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNmZHM2NitzM2EwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":2700,"nextInTopic":2702,"prevInTime":2700,"nextInTime":2702,"topicId":2700,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Becky - If you tell us what state you re in we can give you more accurate/helpful info.  ~Rue [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-28155953\">Hi Becky - If you tell us what state you&#39;re in we can give you more<br/>\naccurate/helpful info.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":195021197,"authorName":"becky_2765","from":"&quot;becky_2765&quot; &lt;becky_2765@...&gt;","profile":"becky_2765","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"First time Filing","postDate":"1092252678","msgId":2700,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNmZHM2NitzM2EwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2701,"prevInTime":2699,"nextInTime":2701,"topicId":2700,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is six and I m filing for the first time this year in Pembroke.
