It is a huge paradigm shift for even<br/>\nthose of us that are seeking the change - when you are asking for that<br/>\nin people that don&#39;t even want to, or have never considered it, it is<br/>\nmuch harder (for all). Some suggestions that come to mind to &#39;help&#39;<br/>\nget them thinking, or at least &#39;see&#39; where you are coming from -<br/>\n<br/>\n**Leave some simple reading material lying around. My family likes to<br/>\nread on the toilet. I leave magazines there (unschooling mags in<br/>\nparticular). Esp stuff that has really &#39;spoken&#39; to you. Maybe print<br/>\nstuff off the web & leave the article there.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Model, model, model. Treat your kids the way you want to without<br/>\nconsidering where they are or who is around or any other circumstance.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Talk to your kids a lot. Maybe even in front of your family. I talk<br/>\nto Nishay (ds7) & tell him why I am doing what I am doing, even if its<br/>\nright in front of my mom or dad or husband. They can understand too<br/>\n(hopefully). I tell him how others feel when he acts a certain way,<br/>\nand I validate his feelings if someone is not treating him properly<br/>\nand show him ways to extricate himself from that environment, or get<br/>\nhim out myself if necessary. I stand up for him even if it means a<br/>\nlittle unpleasantness with the rest of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Talk to your husband when you have time alone with him. If he can<br/>\nstart seeing where you are coming from, things will get much easier<br/>\nwith the rest of the family. You need him on your side, the sooner the<br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Hook up with other parents with similar parental philosophies. Hang<br/>\nout with them as a family. It helped my husband get on board faster. <br/>\n<br/>\n**When others ask about your homeschooling, let your husband answer.<br/>\nMove away discreetly and see what happens. He may look to you for more<br/>\ninfo & eventually &#39;get it&#39; the more you get into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few things I could think of right off the bat. I hope something<br/>\nhelps.

I live in Trinidad and Tobago and although I am sure that there are lots of things <br/>\ndifferent than life in India, I am sure that there are definitely some things that are the <br/>\nsame.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, getting to unschooling in a real way required me to go bit by bit.  And sometimes <br/>\nwe, as parents, have to pay attention to the big principles - complete respect, everyone <br/>\nhas the right to choose, rather than agonising about the fine points.  Scott Noelle&#39;s <br/>\nnewsletter &#39;the Daily Groove&#39; has been a big help to staying on track.  <br/>\n<br/>\nToday I was with my mother - and I have been definitely brought up with the &#39;respect your <br/>\nelders, talk about children in front of them, don&#39;t allow your children to embarass you&#39; <br/>\nlifestyle - and several times it was a bit tempting to go down the road of not doing what <br/>\nmade sense/parental guilt/ many apologies.  But then once I hold as critical that I really <br/>\nwant to treat my children with full respect, it becomes much easier.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when my 8 year old son was being adamant that he didn&#39;t want to stay at my parents I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t run screaming out the door behind him with car keys in my hand but I did sit down <br/>\nand hear his sadness and eventually he ran out the room to play with his cousins.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nrespond to my mother&#39;s comments but calmly went ahead and did what made sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoing our own personal/emotional work makes a big difference as a parent - examining <br/>\nhow you feel when you are getting confused, talking out your challenges with another <br/>\nadult.  And in addition setting up a zero tolerance in your self with authoritarian <br/>\nbehaviours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck Poonam and keep being motivated to create a different experience within your <br/>\nfamily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGillian<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, poonam kurani &lt;kidsdomain@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello to All,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; It takes a lot of courage to go against the wind.
