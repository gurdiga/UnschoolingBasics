Candy is a very high commodity here. My own food issues <br/>\nstarted with being denied candy as a child. I don&#39;t want to pass that issue on <br/>\nto our kids. Iam scared that they&#39;ll gorge themselves and only want to eat <br/>\ncandy. It&#39;s illogical, but that&#39;s my fear. I should go get some more and keep a <br/>\nstash hidden in the house somewhere, and when we&#39;re running low in the pantry I <br/>\ncan easily top it up. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t keep anything hidden. Keep a giant bowl of lollipops right where everyone can see and reach them. GIANT. BOWL. of LOLLIPOPS!<br/>\nYes, the bowl will be emptied probably six or seven times the first week. five or six times the second. But I bet that, if you kept that bowl topped off ALWAYS (Don&#39;t let it ever actually BE empty! If three are left, fill &#39;er up!), by week three or four, there will be candy still left at the end of the day/week. Eventually, it will stay full.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep giant bowls of M&Ms, Skittles, Jelly Bellies, pistachios, and almonds. The nuts seem to go fastest here. &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the candy went pretty fast the first few months. Guess who was eating all those M&Ms? ME! And my husband. The kids had their fill after a week or two. But I kept it FULL. No one here (even me!) eats M&Ms any more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the nuts go regularly still, but the candy stays until we have guests. &lt;G&gt; Then *they* eat all the candy. And you can tell the kids who are limited. They&#39;re the ones who are sneaking in and grabbing handfuls and stuffing them as fast as they can in their mouths.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we&#39;re expecting guests, I usually top the bowls off and keep a spare bag or two in the drawer to refill during the week.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids can have all the candy they want any time they want. They eat *very* little candy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI challenge you do this. The dollar store has lots and lots of candy---a buck a bag. By $20 or $30 worth...and give it MONTHS. But I guarantee you&#39;ll see them turn their noses up at it eventually. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT....you can&#39;t EVER let the bowl get empty.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh---and we&#39;ve had al sorts of candy. I found that wrapped candy (Kisses or Tootsie Roll Pops) makes it take a while to get at to eat, but I was constantly picking up wrappers. Loose candy (Skittles & M&Ms) have no wrappers to pick up, but a handful goes quickly. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&quot;There is no single effort more radical in its potential for saving the world than a transformation of the way we raise our children.&quot; Marianne Williamson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193064123,"authorName":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;marbleface@...&quot; &lt;marbleface@...&gt;","profile":"marbleface@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: 1 lollipop, 3 kids","postDate":"1285346758","msgId":44868,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk3aWtrNitvZGZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk3Z211MytlM3VuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44863,"nextInTopic":44872,"prevInTime":44867,"nextInTime":44869,"topicId":44844,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Banks give them away free here -- the main point of going to the bank per DN4 :) -- and the dollar store sells them for cheap.

How do you make it?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I meant quick and easy - quick and dirty is a colloquialism from my childhood, sorry. The easiest kind of candy to make is actually frosting - water whipped with confectioner&#39;s sugar (powdered sugar). It can also be made with butter, peanut butter, mashed potato (or mashed sweet potato or squash for that matter) in place of the water. The simplest is to drop little dots onto waxed paper - nearly instant candy! But you can also get clever with it and add things like food colors, flavors and sprinkles or add coco to the sugar - or coconut for that matter. You can use a cake-decorating tool to make little stars and flowers, or lay downn layers of different colors to make fancy candies that can be cut in squares or even rolled up like a jelly roll and then cut in discs. We had a couple years of being painfully broke most of the time, so frosting &quot;candy&quot; was a great way to deal with a child wanting sweets when there was no money for either sweets or gasoline!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother easy way to make your own sweet is to toast nuts in a skillet with oil or butter and sugar. And! you can sprinkle sugar over edible flower petals (roses and pansies for instance - fairy candy!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you want to really go nuts (as it were) with candy-making, look for books on the subject. Hard candies need a candy thermometer, and I found them stressful with little kids around - the liquid candy is Dangerously hot and cools slowly, but you can also drizzle the hot syrup into water and get long strings of candy that can be eaten right away.
