He can literally bounce on a mini trampoline (really saves<br/>\nthe furniture!) while playing videogames and keep track of his character<br/>\nand all the other players using split screen AND beat the shoes off<br/>\nthem. One time, just to test a theory I had, I waited until a usual<br/>\nsituation occurred - I was sitting at the table finishing reading an<br/>\narticle after dinner. He came in to tell me the plot of a story he was<br/>\nthinking about. As he was talking, he was walking circles around the<br/>\ntable, with occasional bounces thrown in at exciting parts. I casually<br/>\nslid my chair slightly so he had to stop to navigate by me. Sure enough<br/>\n(as I had hypothesized), he stopped talking when he stopped walking. As<br/>\nsoon as he was by me, he continued (I then moved my chair back out of<br/>\nhis way).  One of his current favorite things is to peddle our recumbent<br/>\nexercise bike while he&#39;s reading - he&#39;ll peddle for a chapter or two<br/>\nthen go back to doing something else.

The larger nuance affecting the &#39;diagnosis&#39; is <br/>\nsubjective to the test giver.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our eldest was twoish, we started getting pretty consistent <br/>\nfeedback from our teacherly friends and family that we ought get <br/>\nhim &quot;tested&quot; for giftedness.  When we asked, &quot;why?&quot; the answers <br/>\n*always* pertained to creating a coding trail to support him having <br/>\naccess to resources in the school system.  This became a big trigger <br/>\nfor us to begin investigating homeschooling, and ultimately, <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I&#39;m almost certain if we were to have him &quot;tested&quot;, he&#39;d <br/>\ndiagnose positive for ADHD.  We have a couch and a loveseat that are <br/>\nbeat to crud from being jumped on:  he bounces as he watches.  He <br/>\nbounces as he thinks.

Take away his ability to be kinesthetic <br/>\nwhile he&#39;s being &quot;gifted&quot; and I have no doubt a behaviour trail could <br/>\nlead to an ADHD conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nLabels -- pah!  I totally echo Pam&#39;s exhortation.  Do away with <br/>\nthem.  We&#39;ve never gotten our boys &quot;tested&quot;, coded, diagnosed ... <br/>\nbecause when we decided we weren&#39;t going to subject them to an <br/>\ninstitutionalized childhood, we understood how utterly meaningless <br/>\nlabels are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel this way about so many habits of institutionally-oriented <br/>\nwestern mainstream.  Our middler used to stutter, and well-meaning <br/>\nfriends and family repeatedly suggested we consider taking him to a <br/>\nspeech pathologist.  My boys&#39; dad even went so far as to take Tristan <br/>\nto our family doc for a referral.  He got the referral paperwork and <br/>\nI filed it under dust on my desktop for a year while Tristan <br/>\ncontinued developing his own voice, as I trusted he would all along.  <br/>\nOne day I suddenly realized, &#39;huh, Tristan doesn&#39;t stutter anymore.&#39;  <br/>\nWhen I imagined what damage could be done to his wee sense of growing <br/>\nSelf and ok-ness would we have subjected him to treatment to &#39;fix&#39; <br/>\nhis very voice ... oof.  I was glad I had the stubborn intuition to <br/>\njust wait out his own developing process of getting himself heard.  <br/>\nHis elder brother always had so very much to say, I always suspected <br/>\nthe stutter was a symptom of his own hurry to get &#39;it&#39; out before <br/>\nbeing interrupted.  Trusting and supporting Tristan to empower his <br/>\nown voice is one of those mothering triumphs I&#39;ll privately always <br/>\ncelebrate.  It was the right thing to do versus intervening with a <br/>\ndiagnosing &#39;fix&#39;.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thinking about it at all will only hold you back and only <br/>\n&gt; hurt him.

Advance notice is really important -<br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ll be leaving at 8:30 so we&#39;ve got 22 minutes&quot; (precision is<br/>\nimportant to him, not &quot;about 20 or 25 minutes&quot;) until we get shoes on&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Okay, 5 minutes until shoes&quot; &quot;Shoe time&quot; and on we go. Timers were good<br/>\nfor him for a time when he was around 5 or 6 years old - we&#39;d set a<br/>\ntimer until X, and he&#39;d go check it for himself. That independence was<br/>\nimportant - I wasn&#39;t telling him when to do something, the timer was and<br/>\nhe could check it whenever he wanted to. The amount of time would, as<br/>\nmuch as possible, be set in consultation with DS &quot;how long do you think<br/>\nwe should set the timer for before your bath?&quot; Things like bath, bed,<br/>\nmeals don&#39;t have set time frames for us so that&#39;s not so big an issue -<br/>\nwe work with his timeframe (his plan for the next few hours - does he<br/>\nwant to watch a particular show? Play a particular game? Etc) Also,<br/>\nlooking forward with him rather than &quot;leaving this game&quot; but instead<br/>\n&quot;going to take a bath&quot; was helpful sometimes - a big one for him back<br/>\nwhen was instead of &quot;leaving friends/playing&quot; after church on Wednesday<br/>\nnights, he was fine with leaving there if we were &quot;going to go check out<br/>\nthe bug zappers&quot; (one possible route home involved driving along/past an<br/>\nold industrial canal by some factories still in use so they had big<br/>\nindustrial bug zappers - we&#39;d roll down the windows and listen to the<br/>\nzap tzit zap bzzz sounds). We also used natural breaks in his own<br/>\nplans/play - commercials, changes of programs, and so on - &quot;since you&#39;re<br/>\ndone with the Legos, how about a bath before you start something else,<br/>\nthat way you&#39;ll be all fresh for &lt;playing whatever&gt; and you can play<br/>\nwith &lt;something&gt; while you&#39;re in the tub&quot; It&#39;s really helpful to remove<br/>\nas many arbitrarily set times as possible so that those few time<br/>\nconstrained situations are less of a fuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

I bought a Gameboy Advance for just $5 and it came with<br/>\nseveral games, and other games are much cheaper than DS games. You can<br/>\nfind them at yard sales, thrift stores or old game trading stores.  My<br/>\nson enjoys it and it&#39;s much easier on our budget to get him new games<br/>\nfor that than the DS. My sons most intense disagreements come about<br/>\nwhen we need to go somewhere and he&#39;s in the middle of a game. In that<br/>\nsituation, I try to catch him in a &#39;transitional&#39; portion of the game,<br/>\nlike he just defeated a level, or something.. to ask him to pause it<br/>\nand come back to it later. That has helped a lot.. it&#39;s much easier<br/>\nfor him to let go and come back later when the game itself had broken<br/>\n&#39;the zone&#39; with transitioning levels and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has also thrown destructive tantrums. But, he also likes to<br/>\nbreak things for fun. He&#39;s very rough and tumble. Instead of<br/>\ncombatting his urge to destroy something, I&#39;ve given him acceptable<br/>\noutlets that are more fun for him than breaking useful things..<br/>\nCardboard boxes drawn up like evil robots, the styrofoam inserts, thin<br/>\nsheets of ice made in pie tins (thats a big hit), leftover wood from<br/>\nprojects, old junk objects.

Nagging is about getting someone do to something that you want them to do. Unschooling is about facilitating to your child&#39;s desires and interests. Nagging shouldn&#39;t come into it, reminding, helping, but not nagging. And think about how wonderful an absence of nagging would be for both of you. I hate nagging, I feel whiney and powerless when I nag. Think about how much more he would trust you to be on his side if he knows that you are making an effort to make his life as easy as possible for him to focus on what he wants to focus on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t like timers, how does he feel about schedules? Can you be more flexible than a schedule would imply? Potential things to do with as few mandatory things as possible. And if possible, have the mandatory things be as flexible as possible. So if you need to go grocery shopping (if you can&#39;t get things delivered), have it be within that day, or within the next couple of days and instead of stopping him within an activity, move to go when he&#39;s done. Simon and Linnaea are good at looking for stopping points within a game or within whatever it is they are doing. But that has come over time and with me being willing to let them decide when it is we need to go. I also will wait to run errands for a time when David is home, if they are things that Simon and Linnaea don&#39;t want to come along for. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Tamara Griesel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:griesellists@...\">griesellists@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 22 February, 2009 10:42:39 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: New to unschooling, need ideas about bedtime and transitions<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re working on having a daily/weekly schedule.  One thing he asked for and I try to accomodate is one &quot;no nag day&quot; per week, in which he can do whatever he wants (within reason).  He has to brush his teeth and be reasonably civil to his sister, but I don&#39;t interrupt him or plan errands that day.  If he wants, he can sit and play Roblox or Zoo Tycoon all day long on that day.  I plan to bake or do projects at home (I try not to take break days myself, it makes me feel guilty when I let things go, since DH works such long hours.)  <br/>\n <br/>\nHe is afraid of timers and of being timed.  He would disagree with that way of putting it.  It&#39;s more that knowing he has a timer or a time limit makes him anxious and agitated.  Which is odd to me, since for me timers are a motivating tool (let&#39;s see if I can finish the dishes in 5 minutes).<br/>\n <br/>\nTamara<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to unschooling, need ideas about bedtime and transitions","postDate":"1235381022","msgId":38443,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwOTk0OS4yNTE2Ni5xbUB3ZWI4NjIxMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38442,"nextInTopic":38444,"prevInTime":38442,"nextInTime":38444,"topicId":38420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You wrote that he likes going skating, but hates the transition of waking and getting ready to go.

I<br/>\npiggyback them out sometimes, and at 11 and 8 they are getting pretty<br/>\nbig, or they run barefoot across the ground to the car and hop in, and<br/>\nget cozy. I also try and schedule nothing early in the day. Sometimes<br/>\nthere are things they want to do when they hear about it but they change their mind on the day. If our going is pivotal to the group happening, we still go, but if they aren&#39;t being dependent on then we don&#39;t go. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ve been doing this since November, have you really just relaxed and<br/>\nnot schedule anything for a couple of months? Can you do things without<br/>\nplanning? Offer the homeschooling coop as an option but not go if he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to? Same with ice skating? Can you help him to stay home? Get someone to come over so that you and your daughter can go? Or find really cool things that you and your daughter can do at home? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can get really frustrated having my plans changed at the last minute. It is a real trick for me to be comfortable with Simon, usually, wanting to stay home when I want to go and do the going out thing. I&#39;m much better than I used to be, but sometimes all my momentum is focused on going out and I get thrown when the plan changes. Everytime I stay with home we have a good time.

Like doctor&#39;s appointments, ice skating (which he really likes, he just hates getting up, putting on shoes, and getting in the car), sometimes other appointments I can&#39;t avoid, and his homeschool group (Also something he really enjoys, once he&#39;s there, because he has a chance to hang out with other kids who &quot;get&quot; him.)  And I do want him to bathe once a week (OK, I&#39;d prefer every other day, but I&#39;m willing to compromise there.)  I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to plan an activity that he and his younger sister both get excited about, then disappoint his younger sister because he doesn&#39;t feel like putting away his game and getting in the car.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] New to unschooling, need ideas about bedtime and transitions","postDate":"1235379919","msgId":38442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3OTMwMC4zNDY1My5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38441,"nextInTopic":38443,"prevInTime":38441,"nextInTime":38443,"topicId":38420,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam wrote really important things.

As much as possible, let him know <br/>\nyou understand that its hard to Want to do two totally different <br/>\nthings at exactly the same time. Its frustrating!

He needs time to Be - time to really dive deep <br/>\ninto whatever he&#39;s doing without worrying about how it will impact <br/>\nanything else. That sounds counter-intuitive, but think of it as <br/>\nthough he needs to know what &quot;full&quot; feels like - he needs to be <br/>\nbetter aquainted by the Internal motivation to move on. That will <br/>\nhelp him feel more in control, rather than being bullied by time <br/>\nitself. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do have plans, try some different strategies - talk to him <br/>\nabout this!

Like my husband, he doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;feel&quot; time.  <br/>\nMy husband deals with it with compulsive clock watching...Andrew <br/>\nseems to still be in denial that time&#39;s arrow actually applies to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tamara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38490,"nextTopicId":38537}}
