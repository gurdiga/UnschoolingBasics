I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Home Education&#39; magazine for years and always meant<br/>\n&gt; to join an unschooling group online, I am finally here. I need some support<br/>\n&gt; and ideas. No one else near me unschools, and I am coming up against<br/>\n&gt; hostility to the point where I have to respond with proof that our children<br/>\n&gt; are learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A brief history of our homeschool:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our girls were both adopted, both of them have trauma history, both of them<br/>\n&gt; were difficult children. 2 years ago, when they were 9 and 10, they finally<br/>\n&gt; began to settle down to where I could get them to cooperate with me. Before<br/>\n&gt; that, obviously, we were 100% unschooled. At ages 9 and 10, neither of them<br/>\n&gt; were reading and math was difficult for both of them, even though I&#39;d been<br/>\n&gt; talking about math in our daily lives for years. They&#39;ve known phonics since<br/>\n&gt; they were 5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Unless you&#39;ve experienced raising children who have trauma history, it is<br/>\n&gt; difficult to understand what it is like. We have family and friends who feel<br/>\n&gt; we were doing a poor job parenting because we didn&#39;t have control of our<br/>\n&gt; children like they thought we should. My girls&#39; emotional health has always<br/>\n&gt; been top priority for me and when I found an expert in parenting children<br/>\n&gt; with trauma history to follow, it helped a great deal. My children still<br/>\n&gt; have some issues, but for most part, they are doing well emotionally.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So, at 9 and 10, I took them to an eye doctor, looking for vision therapy<br/>\n&gt; since we were at the point where I felt like I could get the girls to work<br/>\n&gt; with me. This eye doctor was no help at all. So like a true unschooler, I<br/>\n&gt; set out to learn all I could about vision therapy. We ended up traveling 10<br/>\n&gt; hours to New York City to consult with the best optometrist I could find. I<br/>\n&gt; learned much through him and he did help the girls, but it was a very<br/>\n&gt; expensive undertaking and it was difficult to get to him. I&#39;ve now found a<br/>\n&gt; doctor who works with vision training an hour from home and because of our<br/>\n&gt; experience with the New York doctor, I am confidant that my children are<br/>\n&gt; getting the best I can get for them. During our recent visit with this<br/>\n&gt; optometrist, I looked at my children sitting very cooperatively in his<br/>\n&gt; office and though &quot;Wow, he can&#39;t tell at all because of their excellent<br/>\n&gt; behavior the behavioral difficulties we&#39;ve been through.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve worked with brain gym, I&#39;ve read books on teaching children who&#39;ve<br/>\n&gt; had difficulty learning to read and we&#39;ve followed the method set out in the<br/>\n&gt; book &quot;Reading Clinic&quot; most days throughout the school year. And now, just as<br/>\n&gt; the girls have turned 11 and 12, they are finally reading. Still beginners,<br/>\n&gt; but reading. In just the last 8 weeks, my twelve yo has made great strides.<br/>\n&gt; My 11 yo has is where her sister had been as she began to read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; The girls are finally catching on to arithmetic also. Again, daily<br/>\n&gt; throughout the school year, I&#39;ve worked with them. For several months we<br/>\n&gt; followed a workbook, then, when it became a real chore daily to get them to<br/>\n&gt; do their math, I started tailoring my own worksheets for them based on their<br/>\n&gt; level and using math books as a guide to be certain we were covering<br/>\n&gt; everything such as fractions, decimals, geometry and all the math vocabulary<br/>\n&gt; that children who do the workbooks are exposed to.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that I&#39;ve written this, I realize I probably don&#39;t have to defend<br/>\n&gt; myself to all of you, as you already understand that children learn as they<br/>\n&gt; are ready. We live in Ohio, where I can either report standardized test<br/>\n&gt; scores to the superintendent, or have a certified teacher sign that the<br/>\n&gt; child is working up to her potential, which is what I&#39;ve done in the past.<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve sent a summary of what we&#39;ve done for the year to a teacher whose<br/>\n&gt; children were homeschooled. I&#39;ve been very honest in the reports and he has<br/>\n&gt; always signed it for me, but with this hostility, we are not comfortable<br/>\n&gt; asking him to sign it without closely following what the girls are learning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am looking for a teacher who is certified in Ohio who understands<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and that some children read late to work with us. I&#39;ve also<br/>\n&gt; contacted a tutoring center, who I would have tried before if it weren&#39;t for<br/>\n&gt; the cost and my confidence that my girls will read and do math just fine as<br/>\n&gt; they are ready.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for listening, and please offer feedback.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jill K.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-- <br/>\nLove, Dawn<br/>\nHelpmeet to Aaron<br/>\nMommy to Thomas (14), Stephen (14), Naomi Ruth (12), Rebekah (10), Hannah<br/>\n(8), Miriam (7), Susanna (5), Benjamin (2), and Matthew (8mo)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":476609039,"authorName":"Jill Finkenbine","from":"Jill Finkenbine &lt;peace.goodwill@...&gt;","profile":"jillinmaplewood","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] In need of support","postDate":"1308530190","msgId":46919,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGltNlZFLWd2bnA9bkxlK1N6UjlES1FIVEhuQWlRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDREZDQ0QwQzg1MUYxQy0yM0UwLTYzNzZBQHdlYm1haWwtbTE2My5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGl0NmJoaCtyZ3R0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8OENERjhCM0U1N0E1QTRBLTExRTgtRkI2NEB3ZWJtYWlsLW0xNTAuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+CTxCQU5Ma1Rpa1pUOTdmOStyOWo0WFNLdGpaTVVNTkFkZVlMUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDhDREY4QkM5N0I5OTgyOS0xMUU4LTExNjkwQHdlYm1haWwtbTE1MC5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4JPEJBTkxrVGlrbkhPUndBQlNRLT1VQz1OWGktRzZRUmMyM19RQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8OENERkNDRDBDODUxRjFDLTIzRTAtNjM3NkFAd2VibWFpbC1tMTYzLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46916,"nextInTopic":46920,"prevInTime":46918,"nextInTime":46920,"topicId":46870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Kelly.

At school, I realized that I read more slowly than my classmates. And I was much distracted in class or when I was studying. I competely lost confidence and my love for learning and reading. When I was older, I was advised to undergo neurological examination and I got some stupid treatment with a cold high diploma docter. Now I still read slowly, but I learned that it has a purpose. I can only fully commit myself to reading what interests me, or what I find important, regarding the difficulty level. And what I read is much in depth and not superficial quick reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to add, not to get too much occupied with looking up docters and experts to investigate eyes and brains. If they need simple basic things like glasses, get them glasses. But apart from that, your girls will do better without special examinations, labels and treatments. <br/>\n<br/>\nHanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":452754049,"authorName":"melissa maranda","from":"melissa maranda &lt;love.gratitude@...&gt;","profile":"marandamelissa","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Re: In need of support","postDate":"1308076734","msgId":46882,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEyMS1XMTdCRUZGMDlBQkI2NTYwMUU5MkExN0Y0NjgwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0ODh1aytnc2xkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PENPTDEyMS1XMTRBNDY4NEZENDQwRkUyOTgzM0ExQkY0NjgwQHBoeC5nYmw+LDxpdDg4dWsrZ3NsZEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":46881,"nextInTopic":46883,"prevInTime":46881,"nextInTime":46883,"topicId":46870,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you so much Meredith!

They&#39;ve known phonics since they were <br/>\n&gt; 5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I don&#39;t know if this is the kind of feedback that you want, but <br/>\nit&#39;s useful for others beginning unschooling to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say your girls are not developmentally ready to read or do <br/>\narithmetic. There are still areas in their brains that need to mature. <br/>\nAnd that can only come with age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s understandable to assume that one difference causes <br/>\neverything that seems out of the norm. But that&#39;s not necessarily so. <br/>\nIt helps to read about the greater variety of norm among unschooled <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids, schooled or unschooled, have reading click for them in the <br/>\n6-8 range. But not being developmentally ready to read at 9 and 10 is <br/>\nnot unusual. Not being ready until 12 or 13 is also not unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids who can&#39;t read go about their lives, learning just <br/>\nfine in ways that are more natural to their brains. Hands on. <br/>\nListening. Picking up clues from pictures. Body movements. Taste and <br/>\nsmells. All are important ways of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooled kids who can&#39;t read are treated as though they were broken in <br/>\nneed of fixing. And they&#39;re subjected to all sorts of lessons to get <br/>\nthem to do what they supposedly haven&#39;t figured out yet. One of the <br/>\nside effects is some can end up feeling stupid. Or, to protect <br/>\nthemselves, feeling reading is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually most of the schooled kids read. So it seems like the <br/>\ninstruction worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, the unschooled kids also eventually read without the instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only common factor is they&#39;ve both gotten older.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Schools focus on reading not because it&#39;s the best way to learn <br/>\neverything but because it&#39;s the cheapest way to mass educate: one <br/>\nteacher can make 30 or more kids read what she wants them to learn and <br/>\nthen quiz them on their understanding. It would be too expensive, need <br/>\ntoo many teachers, to allow each child to learn in the ways that are <br/>\nbest for them. And since the focus is on reading, what kids learn is <br/>\nfocused on what&#39;s best acquired through reading, rather than on what <br/>\nit&#39;s best to learn. (Which is highly individual anyway!)<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is much much more than a mechanical process of applying <br/>\nknowledge to print -- despite what schools keep trying to get kids to <br/>\ndo. Despite the fact that it *seems* to make sense that reading is <br/>\njust sounding out letters and squishing them together into words.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will get phonics because that&#39;s how their brains work. But <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need phonics to figure out reading. They will figure out <br/>\nthe rules that help with whatever they&#39;re puzzling out as they go <br/>\nalong. And they&#39;ll do it without realizing they&#39;re doing it ;-) They <br/>\nwill absorb an understanding by reading and getting real feedback <br/>\n(whether the meaning they&#39;ve pulled from the black squiggles makes <br/>\nsense). Just as kids absorb an understanding of speech by speaking, by <br/>\ngetting feedback, by absorbing the interesting (to them) parts of <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for lots of kids, phonics is a layer of confusion between them and <br/>\nthe words.

I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Home Education&#39; magazine for years and always meant to <br/>\njoin an unschooling group online, I am finally here.  I need some support and <br/>\nideas.  No one else near me unschools, and I am coming up against hostility to <br/>\nthe point where I have to respond with proof that our children are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief history of our homeschool:<br/>\n<br/>\nOur girls were both adopted, both of them have trauma history, both of them were <br/>\ndifficult children.  2 years ago, when they were 9 and 10, they finally began to <br/>\nsettle down to where I could get them to cooperate with me.  Before that, <br/>\nobviously, we were 100% unschooled.  At ages 9 and 10, neither of them were <br/>\nreading and math was difficult for both of them, even though I&#39;d been talking <br/>\nabout math in our daily lives for years.  They&#39;ve known phonics since they were <br/>\n5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you&#39;ve experienced raising children who have trauma history, it is <br/>\ndifficult to understand what it is like.  We have family and friends who feel we <br/>\nwere doing a poor job parenting because we didn&#39;t have control of our children <br/>\nlike they thought we should.  My girls&#39; emotional health has always been top <br/>\npriority for me and when I found an expert in parenting children with trauma <br/>\nhistory to follow, it helped a great deal.  My children still have some issues, <br/>\nbut for most part, they are doing well emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at 9 and 10, I took them to an eye doctor, looking for vision therapy since <br/>\nwe were at the point where I felt like I could get the girls to work with me.  <br/>\nThis eye doctor was no help at all.  So like a true unschooler, I set out to <br/>\nlearn all I could about vision therapy.  We ended up traveling 10 hours to New <br/>\nYork City to consult with the best optometrist I could find.  I learned much <br/>\nthrough him and he did help the girls, but it was a very expensive undertaking <br/>\nand it was difficult to get to him.  I&#39;ve now found a doctor who works with <br/>\nvision training an hour from home and because of our experience with the New <br/>\nYork doctor, I am confidant that my children are getting the best I can get for <br/>\nthem.  During our recent visit with this optometrist, I looked at my children <br/>\nsitting very cooperatively in his office and though &quot;Wow, he can&#39;t tell at all <br/>\nbecause of their excellent behavior the behavioral difficulties we&#39;ve been <br/>\nthrough.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve worked with brain gym, I&#39;ve read books on teaching children who&#39;ve had <br/>\ndifficulty learning to read and we&#39;ve followed the method set out in the book <br/>\n&quot;Reading Clinic&quot; most days throughout the school year. And now, just as the <br/>\ngirls have turned 11 and 12, they are finally reading.  Still beginners, but <br/>\nreading.  In just the last 8 weeks, my twelve yo has made great strides.  My 11 <br/>\nyo has is where her sister had been as she began to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls are finally catching on to arithmetic also. Again, daily throughout <br/>\nthe school year, I&#39;ve worked with them. For several months we followed a <br/>\nworkbook, then, when it became a real chore daily to get them to do their math, <br/>\nI started tailoring my own worksheets for them based on their level and using <br/>\nmath books as a guide to be certain we were covering everything such as <br/>\nfractions, decimals, geometry and all the math vocabulary that children who do <br/>\nthe workbooks are exposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;ve written this, I realize I probably don&#39;t have to defend myself to <br/>\nall of you, as you already understand that children learn as they are ready.  We <br/>\nlive in Ohio, where I can either report standardized test scores to the <br/>\nsuperintendent, or have a certified teacher sign that the child is working up to <br/>\nher potential, which is what I&#39;ve done in the past.

There are still areas in their brains that need to mature.  <br/>\nAnd that can only come with age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s understandable to assume that  one difference causes  <br/>\neverything that seems out of the norm. But that&#39;s not necessarily so.  <br/>\nIt helps to read about the greater variety of norm among unschooled  <br/>\nkids.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost kids, schooled or unschooled, have reading click for them in the  <br/>\n6-8 range. But not being developmentally ready to read at 9 and 10 is  <br/>\nnot unusual. Not being ready until 12 or 13 is also not unusual.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids who can&#39;t read go about their lives, learning just  <br/>\nfine in ways that are more natural to their brains. Hands on.  <br/>\nListening. Picking up clues from pictures. Body movements. Taste and  <br/>\nsmells. All are important ways of learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooled kids who can&#39;t read are treated as though they were broken in  <br/>\nneed of fixing. And they&#39;re subjected to all sorts of lessons to get  <br/>\nthem to do what they supposedly haven&#39;t figured out yet. One of the  <br/>\nside effects is some can end up feeling stupid. Or, to protect  <br/>\nthemselves, feeling reading is stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually most of the schooled kids read. So it seems like the  <br/>\ninstruction worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, the unschooled kids also eventually read without the instruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only common factor is they&#39;ve both gotten older.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Schools focus on reading not because it&#39;s the best way to learn  <br/>\neverything but because it&#39;s the cheapest way to mass educate: one  <br/>\nteacher can make 30 or more kids read what she wants them to learn and  <br/>\nthen quiz them on their understanding. It would be too expensive, need  <br/>\ntoo many teachers, to allow each child to learn in the ways that are  <br/>\nbest for them. And since the focus is on reading, what kids learn is  <br/>\nfocused on what&#39;s best acquired through reading, rather than on what  <br/>\nit&#39;s best to learn. (Which is highly individual anyway!)<br/>\n<br/>\nReading is much much more than a mechanical process of applying  <br/>\nknowledge to print -- despite what schools keep trying to get kids to  <br/>\ndo. Despite the fact that it *seems* to make sense that reading is  <br/>\njust sounding out letters and squishing them together into words.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids will get phonics because that&#39;s how their brains work. But  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need phonics to figure out reading. They will figure out  <br/>\nthe rules that help with whatever they&#39;re puzzling out as they go  <br/>\nalong. And they&#39;ll do it without realizing they&#39;re doing it ;-) They  <br/>\nwill absorb an understanding by reading and getting real feedback  <br/>\n(whether the meaning they&#39;ve pulled from the black squiggles makes  <br/>\nsense). Just as kids absorb an understanding of speech by speaking, by  <br/>\ngetting feedback, by absorbing the interesting (to them) parts of  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for lots of kids, phonics is a layer of confusion between them and  <br/>\nthe words. Many kids absorb words whole. It sounds inefficient! But  <br/>\nit&#39;s how their brains work.

No one else near me unschools, and I am coming up against hostility to the point where I have to respond with proof that our children are learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief history of our homeschool:<br/>\n<br/>\nOur girls were both adopted, both of them have trauma history, both of them were difficult children.  2 years ago, when they were 9 and 10, they finally began to settle down to where I could get them to cooperate with me.  Before that, obviously, we were 100% unschooled.  At ages 9 and 10, neither of them were reading and math was difficult for both of them, even though I&#39;d been talking about math in our daily lives for years.  They&#39;ve known phonics since they were 5 and 6, but weren&#39;t applying it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you&#39;ve experienced raising children who have trauma history, it is difficult to understand what it is like.  We have family and friends who feel we were doing a poor job parenting because we didn&#39;t have control of our children like they thought we should.  My girls&#39; emotional health has always been top priority for me and when I found an expert in parenting children with trauma history to follow, it helped a great deal.  My children still have some issues, but for most part, they are doing well emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at 9 and 10, I took them to an eye doctor, looking for vision therapy since we were at the point where I felt like I could get the girls to work with me.  This eye doctor was no help at all.  So like a true unschooler, I set out to learn all I could about vision therapy.  We ended up traveling 10 hours to New York City to consult with the best optometrist I could find.  I learned much through him and he did help the girls, but it was a very expensive undertaking and it was difficult to get to him.  I&#39;ve now found a doctor who works with vision training an hour from home and because of our experience with the New York doctor, I am confidant that my children are getting the best I can get for them.  During our recent visit with this optometrist, I looked at my children sitting very cooperatively in his office and though &quot;Wow, he can&#39;t tell at all because of their excellent behavior the behavioral difficulties we&#39;ve been through.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve worked with brain gym, I&#39;ve read books on teaching children who&#39;ve had difficulty learning to read and we&#39;ve followed the method set out in the book &quot;Reading Clinic&quot; most days throughout the school year. And now, just as the girls have turned 11 and 12, they are finally reading.  Still beginners, but reading.  In just the last 8 weeks, my twelve yo has made great strides.  My 11 yo has is where her sister had been as she began to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls are finally catching on to arithmetic also. Again, daily throughout the school year, I&#39;ve worked with them. For several months we followed a workbook, then, when it became a real chore daily to get them to do their math, I started tailoring my own worksheets for them based on their level and using math books as a guide to be certain we were covering everything such as fractions, decimals, geometry and all the math vocabulary that children who do the workbooks are exposed to.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I&#39;ve written this, I realize I probably don&#39;t have to defend myself to all of you, as you already understand that children learn as they are ready.  We live in Ohio, where I can either report standardized test scores to the superintendent, or have a certified teacher sign that the child is working up to her potential, which is what I&#39;ve done in the past.  I&#39;ve sent a summary of what we&#39;ve done for the year to a teacher whose children were homeschooled.  I&#39;ve been very honest in the reports and he has always signed it for me, but with this hostility, we are not comfortable asking him to sign it without closely following what the girls are learning.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for a teacher who is certified in Ohio who understands unschooling and that some children read late to work with us.  I&#39;ve also contacted a tutoring center, who I would have tried before if it weren&#39;t for the cost and my confidence that my girls will read and do math just fine as they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening, and please offer feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nJill K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46899,"nextTopicId":46878}}
