She got good grades in school math but never liked it and never saw a<br/>\npoint to most of it (she is smart is she not?!). Her ds9 has been in school<br/>\nuntil this year and has a very poor image of himself due to his math<br/>\ndifficulties.&quot;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple things I notice here: one is that it is the parent, and not the son who is <br/>\nasking for help. Whether anything you suggest is going to be helpful or not is going to <br/>\ndepend on the context of their relationship. Is she an unschooling mother who seeking to <br/>\nhelp him to follow up an interest or pursue an ambition? Or is she a school-at home <br/>\nmother who is anxious about the fact that her son doesn&#39;t appear particularly interested in <br/>\nlearning or doing mathematics? If that is true then any &quot;help&quot; that you provide is likely to <br/>\nbe resented, and to persaude him not to like mathematics *permanently*.<br/>\nThe other is that you say that he &quot;has a very poor image of himself due to his math <br/>\ndifficulties&quot;. Having diifficulty at math is a reason to be frustrated or disappointed, not to <br/>\nhave a poor image of yourself. We all have our particular talents; we just need to find out <br/>\nwhat they are and to match them up with our interests. A better reason to feel good about <br/>\nyourself is to feel that you have something to offer to the world. Even if her son were able <br/>\nto improve his self-image by succeeding at learning some mathematics, what he would <br/>\nhave acquired is a rather fragile and I think ultimately harmful form of ego-based self-<br/>\nimage; a seemingly inevitable consequence would be to consider those less talented or <br/>\nskillful than he to be unworthy, possibly even contemptible.<br/>\nOn the other hand, if you have a personal relationship with him and wish to simply pique <br/>\nhis interest, I would suggest that you show him Thales&#39; proof that a triangle inscribed in a <br/>\ncircle whose base is a diameter of the circle is a right triangle. So far as we know it was <br/>\none of the first proofs ever given; and though it is incredibly simple it is to my mind <br/>\naesthetically spectacular. Also you can find some way of letting him know that you &quot;know&quot; <br/>\nstuff, in a way that will seem relatively accessible to him - like being able to interpret the <br/>\nimages taken of Titan or Enceladeus perhaps. Or how about a puzzle: I learned from Jacob <br/>\nBronowski&#39;s &quot;Ascent of Man&quot; series that during the industrial revolution in 18th century <br/>\nEngland, people were starting to do quite a lot of mining; and to go deeper they needed to <br/>\nbe able to pump the water out that would otherwise collect in the mines. During the <br/>\nprocess of doing that they discovered that they could only pump the water upward by a <br/>\ncertain amount (32 ft. I think it was); then they would have to empty it into a container, <br/>\nand set up another pump to get it up another 32 ft. and so on. It was a nice example of a <br/>\nsimple, quantitative pattern that the physicists were later able to explain. And in general: I <br/>\nthink the history of science and mathematics provides us with the simplest and most <br/>\naccessible examples.<br/>\nI got interested in science by first getting interested in science fiction around age 12; then <br/>\nI browsed the science section of a local bookstore and found George Gamov&#39;s <br/>\n&quot;1,2,3...infinity.&quot; I spent a couple years in college as a Physics major before discovering <br/>\nthat actually I was more interested in storytelling (!)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119968487,"authorName":"jenniferbreseman","from":"&quot;jenniferbreseman&quot; &lt;jen@...&gt;","profile":"jenniferbreseman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Real life math resources?","postDate":"1204726557","msgId":30520,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZxbTl1dCtnZGNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMzRjIyQzBCLjlCMjglem9hY29ubmVyQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":30519,"nextInTopic":30575,"prevInTime":30519,"nextInTime":30521,"topicId":30490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Living Math:  http://www.livingmath.net/ is a great resource.

I&#39;m<br/>\nnot sure of the name now, on the computer.  (They have a lot of<br/>\ndifferent Star Wars games) but games like Civilization would also work<br/>\nso would Zoo Tycoon or any of the Tycoon games.  Liam learned about<br/>\nbudgeting resources from playing.  If he needed war ships for a<br/>\nplanet, he had to build them somewhere else, and fly them to where he<br/>\nneeded them but while he was building war ships he couldn&#39;t build<br/>\nanything else so he really had to think about what was important (RL:<br/>\nbills and food) and what could wait (RL: recreation and toys) until he<br/>\nhad the things he needed built.  And the games all have an economy so<br/>\nthere is math involved there too.  It was the EASIEST way for it to<br/>\nclick for Liam.  Because he was doing it and in control of it and he<br/>\nsaw what happened when he failed to allocate resources properly (for<br/>\nthe way his game was going and the goals he was trying to accomplish)<br/>\nand so he&#39;d end up replaying until he got it right and just one day we<br/>\nwere talking about money etc and he could explain it to me because of<br/>\nthe game.  Much better for him to learn it himself one of those real<br/>\nlife lessons without it being real life you know?  And it was fun for<br/>\nhim, PLUS now he understands the concept and can apply it to other<br/>\ngames he plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":238795563,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;jlblock01@...&gt;","profile":"jlblock01","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Real life math resources?","postDate":"1204725867","msgId":30515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZxbTk5YitmOWdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEMzRjIyQzBCLjlCMjglem9hY29ubmVyQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":30490,"nextInTopic":30519,"prevInTime":30514,"nextInTime":30516,"topicId":30490,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There are tons of reasons for math... grocery shopping, sewing, cooking, finances etc that are fairly easy to discover...heck you will even do algebra in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1083339036\">There are tons of &quot;reasons&quot; for math... grocery shopping, sewing,<br/>\ncooking, finances etc that are fairly easy to discover...heck you will<br/>\neven do algebra in daily life now and then!
