I seem to always find the answers inside of<br/>\nme. The biggest part of my spiritual journey in life (as if there are<br/>\nseparate parts of life!) seems to be learning to trust My self, My<br/>\ninstincts, MY ideas. The real ones. So unschooling is another attitude or<br/>\nskill that helps me on this path.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What can I do to help me see my kids as people and not as my &#39;wards&#39;?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--remind myself that they are the younger versions of the adults they will<br/>\nbecome.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Will my kids ever trust me?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--right about the time I start trusting them, they start trusting me. It&#39;s<br/>\nbeen that quick.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the one that circulates in various forms and will earn me a lot of coins<br/>\nin my deschooling can:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;How can I make this big change? What if I mess up and regress and then what<br/>\nwill those kids think then? I certainly shouldn&#39;t tell them I am making this<br/>\nchange or they will hold me to it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Tell them! Open a dialogue with an open mind and share your trepidations<br/>\nand fears! Then you will hear how silly most of it is and they will glimpse<br/>\nyour process and share your progress!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you know what? It&#39;s working.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathing, breathing, breathing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMary Alice<br/>\n<br/>\nWho has been a nonsmoker for 7 days now. Here is a great illustration<br/>\nproving that it was a good idea to share my process with these kids: I asked<br/>\naloud, &quot;How do people ever do this and not go insane?&quot; The older child<br/>\nresponded, &quot;They don&#39;t quit smoking at the same time!&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15942,"nextTopicId":15966}}
