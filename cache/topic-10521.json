If a parent feels bad about making a screaming<br/>\nchild <br/>\n&gt; brush their teeth, how will that parent feel trying to comfort a<br/>\nscreaming child <br/>\n&gt; with an abscessed tooth, or getting a screaming child to the dentist<br/>\nto have a <br/>\n&gt; root canal?

He started it one day and handed me a toy to put in the bucket<br/>\nand said, &quot;what color?&quot; I told him and he handed me another asking - it<br/>\nbecame a routine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy issue was not about neglect for unschooling to me it is about treating<br/>\nchildren as people who have their own thoughts, opinions, feelings, tastes<br/>\nand agendas. He is very intelligent but no more so that an average five and<br/>\nhalf year old. He understand concepts that might be scary sometimes. He<br/>\nunderstands that safety is how we avoid getting hurt. He doesn&#39;t like to get<br/>\nhurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, some people might think that giving your child the freedom to discover<br/>\nthe world on his own, make his own mistakes, choose what he wants to eat,<br/>\nwhen he wants to eat, when he wants to sleep, etc I guess could be construed<br/>\nas neglect. I don&#39;t and it wasn&#39;t what I was even talking about. The only<br/>\nthing I originally posted was to ask couldn&#39;t I be held negligent?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will tell you DS has been a chunky boy from birth. He was 35 lbs before he<br/>\nwas a year. I called him my little mutant and my butterball turkey when he<br/>\nwas an infant. We controlled things very much - only allowed two cookies or<br/>\neat more meat before you can have more veggies. We stopped that and he has<br/>\nlost weight. I can&#39;t tell you how much lbs wise but to the point that we had<br/>\nto by smaller pants and a belt because even the pants that fit him are like<br/>\nan inch too big. It has been gradual, just like the letting go of control<br/>\nbut it has happened. I look forward to letting more go as he gets older and<br/>\nbecomes more capable and self reliant - of course I will always be here to<br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>] On Behalf Of <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:HMSL2@...\">HMSL2@...</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, March 10, 2006 8:56 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Safety issues<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t disagree more with the &quot;fear&quot;factor and what if&#39;s. <br/>\nToo close to the schools push of good grades or you will be a poor jobless  <br/>\nstay at home parent with loads of children and a looser husband.

I think a  <br/>\ndriver is allowed to have that rule--I&#39;m another mom who does. I  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t yet had to force my kids to wear seatbelts; it&#39;s a lifelong  <br/>\nhabit for them (well, OK, the little one is still in a car seat, so I  <br/>\nguess I&#39;m talking about my older one here). We&#39;ve never had a moment  <br/>\nof conflict about it, and it didn&#39;t sound like Shannon had a conflict  <br/>\nwith her own kid--but rather with the mother of another kid. I think  <br/>\none can be an unschooler and still have some non-negotiable safety  <br/>\nrules--but if I had a kid who didn&#39;t want to wear a seatbelt, I would  <br/>\ntalk to him about why he didn&#39;t want to wear it and try to find out  <br/>\nif there was a problem that could be fixed, or a solution that would  <br/>\nmeet my need to feel he was safe and his need to --what? be  <br/>\ncomfortable? not be strangled by the shoulder belt? be able to see  <br/>\nout the front window? feel autonomous? The answer wouldn&#39;t be, &quot;well,  <br/>\nbuster, you better buy a bus pas then because you&#39;re not getting in  <br/>\nmy car!&quot; Nor would it be, &quot;Oh, OK, then, just unbuckle yourself and  <br/>\nsit there, no problem.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Safety issues","postDate":"1141959577","msgId":10572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZhM2NlZGZhN2NjMy5mYTdjYzNmYTNjZWRAZGlyZWN3YXkuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10569,"nextInTopic":10574,"prevInTime":10571,"nextInTime":10573,"topicId":10521,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" Whoa, nelly!!

What about the kid who begins to notice that other <br/>\n&gt; parents require their <br/>\n&gt; kids to do what it takes to be safe while his parent does not?  <br/>\n&gt; What about the <br/>\n&gt; kid who sees that his parent is willing to break the law to <br/>\n&gt; accommodate him?    <br/>\n&gt; The brazen process of letting small children make uninformed <br/>\n&gt; choices about <br/>\n&gt; health and safety is the main issue that I really question in the <br/>\n&gt; UNschooling <br/>\n&gt; world.  It carries a good concept to extremes that can be very <br/>\n&gt; harmful.  How can <br/>\n&gt; a child predict how they would feel about a life of surgeries and <br/>\n&gt; painkillers, with one parent probably in jail, and the other <br/>\n&gt; financially strapped?  Over <br/>\n&gt; my 15 year journey through homeschooling/eclectic learning/child <br/>\n&gt; led <br/>\n&gt; unschooling, it has been confusing to me to hear parents equate <br/>\n&gt; their understandable <br/>\n&gt; disagreements about government schooling with letting their five <br/>\n&gt; year old eat <br/>\n&gt; all the sugar he wants, watch all the cable TV he wants, or <br/>\n&gt; dispute wearing a <br/>\n&gt; seatbelt.  This covers issues big and small that have more to do <br/>\n&gt; with the <br/>\n&gt; parents own self esteem and personal boundaries, than with any <br/>\n&gt; educational theory or <br/>\n&gt; life style choice.  If a parent feels bad about making a screaming <br/>\n&gt; child <br/>\n&gt; brush their teeth, how will that parent feel trying to comfort a <br/>\n&gt; screaming child <br/>\n&gt; with an abscessed tooth, or getting a screaming child to the <br/>\n&gt; dentist to have a <br/>\n&gt; root canal?

So, I agree that being <br/>\n&gt; safe is important. However, we don&#39;t have a rule that says &#39;hold <br/>\n&gt; hands crossing the street&#39;. Which street? What circumstances? What <br/>\n&gt; if *I* don&#39;t have a hand free (such as in the grocery parking lot <br/>\n&gt; when it&#39;s all I can do with two hands to maneuver the overloaded <br/>\n&gt; cart)? And so on - there are so many circumstances possible, not <br/>\n&gt; to <br/>\n&gt; mention he&#39;s simply growing up and maturing. We just do what it <br/>\n&gt; takes to be safe - a busy street, hold hands. Not so busy, maybe <br/>\n&gt; simply walking close together. Mom&#39;s hands occupied? Stay close or <br/>\n&gt; hold a sleeve or pocket or whatever. Sometimes I&#39;ll remind DS as <br/>\n&gt; we <br/>\n&gt; get out of the car what the environment we&#39;re entering looks to be <br/>\n&gt; like &quot;looks like the parking lot is busy today&quot; &quot;wow, there&#39;s no <br/>\n&gt; one <br/>\n&gt; here today&quot; &quot;gee, the road looks kind of slippery&quot; or whatever. <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes he&#39;ll simply put his arm around my waist instead of <br/>\n&gt; holding hands (and I lay my arm across his shoulders and we walk <br/>\n&gt; close together - I love those times!) We&#39;ve never had a rebellion <br/>\n&gt; on <br/>\n&gt; this because there&#39;s no rule to rebel against.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now seatbelts...from the time he could talk, we&#39;ve given him free <br/>\n&gt; rein to YELL at any grownup that started the car if he was not <br/>\n&gt; buckled in. It was a rare occurrence when we were doing the <br/>\n&gt; buckling, but every once in a while, DH and I would both have our <br/>\n&gt; arms full of stuff, get DS into the car, I thought he buckled, he <br/>\n&gt; though I buckled, we&#39;d not get more than an inch and we&#39;d <br/>\n&gt; hear &quot;BUCKLEBUCKLEBUCKLE!!!&quot; and stop the car as soon as safe  <br/>\n&gt; (sometimes you can&#39;t just stop midstream) and buckle him in. Now <br/>\n&gt; that he can buckle his own seatbelt, he&#39;ll let us know when he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; ready to go.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Part of *my* issue with safety is that sometimes what I think is <br/>\n&gt; hazardous or bound to cause injury, really is not so bad and some <br/>\n&gt; things I know DS can handle safely, he&#39;s not so sure of. I think <br/>\n&gt; of <br/>\n&gt; all that can go wrong on something but often DS has already worked <br/>\n&gt; that out in his own way and knows exactly what needs doing and <br/>\n&gt; how. <br/>\n&gt; For instance, vaulting/rolling over the back of the couch - yikes. <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; can see him bouncing and hitting the hardwood floor, I can see him <br/>\n&gt; bumping and bruising on the arms or back if he hits a little off, <br/>\n&gt; I <br/>\n&gt; can see a bad landing causing all sorts of damage. But, he knows <br/>\n&gt; what he&#39;s doing. I&#39;ll suggest safety improvements on occasion or <br/>\n&gt; other ways to reach the same type goal if it is really unsafe but <br/>\n&gt; sometimes it&#39;s just MY issue and that&#39;s all. So, I make sure we&#39;ve <br/>\n&gt; got insurance, good first aid kits, first aid and CPR training, <br/>\n&gt; gas <br/>\n&gt; in the car at all times that is enough to get to an emergency <br/>\n&gt; room, <br/>\n&gt; location of nearest hospital and two routes minimum to get there, <br/>\n&gt; and so on (can you tell this is a &#39;thing&#39; with me? lol) Then I let <br/>\n&gt; life happen. He&#39;s already had two broken arms in the most <br/>\n&gt; innocuous <br/>\n&gt; ways I could imagine - in one case, he was about 18 months old and <br/>\n&gt; doing what 18 month olds do - he was running and playing. He was <br/>\n&gt; also on indoor/outdoor carpet over concrete and he tripped somehow <br/>\n&gt; (not sure how, it wasn&#39;t over or on anything, just one of those <br/>\n&gt; caught his shoe on the carpet things) and landed oddly and broke <br/>\n&gt; (cleanly) his right radius near the wrist. The flip side is that I <br/>\n&gt; know he can manage a table knife just fine. We have two kinds - <br/>\n&gt; black handled and silver handled. We also have black handled steak <br/>\n&gt; knives. They are kept in separate locations so there&#39;s no question <br/>\n&gt; of which is which (and the handles and blades are visibly <br/>\n&gt; different <br/>\n&gt; styles, despite the color). Still, DS will not touch ANY black <br/>\n&gt; handled knife just in case - he feels safer that way. So sometimes <br/>\n&gt; what I think is okay is not okay with him. So while I do talk and <br/>\n&gt; discuss and impart information on the situation, we don&#39;t do <br/>\n&gt; &#39;safety <br/>\n&gt; rules&#39; - just a basic principle to cover the whole lot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday, on a highway right near us, they had a &#39;seatbelt <br/>\n&gt; checkpoint&#39;. Since wearing them is mandatory and a primary item <br/>\n&gt; (they can pull you over for that on its own, not just in <br/>\n&gt; conjunction <br/>\n&gt; with other driving infractions), they would stop and ticket anyone <br/>\n&gt; not wearing a seatbelt. So, your friend would have a problem in <br/>\n&gt; those type circumstances - which might be a point to bring up when <br/>\n&gt; discussing the situation with her (if you do).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; --Deb<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I had <br/>\nvisions of the punishment/discussion or fear she would consider  instilling in <br/>\nher child (said she had one 18 months old) bc of  the DANGEROUS windows.<br/>\nI looked at her and said &quot;Oh yes! Thank you but it&#39;s ok my husband can fix  <br/>\nanything.&quot; She said &quot;Oh, no.. I meant that they may get their heads stuck or  <br/>\nworse.&quot; Worse??? <br/>\nLOL yeah my kids roll their heads up in windows.. To which I said &quot;If their  <br/>\nhappy im happy and they look to be having fun.&quot;  I was thinking that it was  <br/>\nfar better than the tears my son shed in BJ&#39;s bc some man touched him to  <br/>\nredirect him to me calling his name. <br/>\n**<br/>\nMy MIL gave me flack for not forcing my son to sit in the back seat. I told  <br/>\nher she was in far worse danger sitting so close to the steering wheel than my <br/>\n son (who was 10 at the time).<br/>\n <br/>\nLots of people have fears of the unknown. Many I have relaxed after having  <br/>\nfour and seeing what didn&#39;t happen. <br/>\nI do see some (many) rules that can conflict with unschooling(radical). <br/>\n <br/>\nAs a parent you have a choice on how you parent and how far you go into  <br/>\nunschooling no one can make those choices for you. Rules do conflict with  <br/>\nunschooling but not the same as safety. I don&#39;t force my children to hold my  hand in <br/>\na parking lot if they don&#39;t want to. I often have my hand on a sleeve or  <br/>\nanything that would save them from an accident and I will get them out of harms  <br/>\nway (which means move them but not to include hit or scold them).<br/>\nI think to break it down, more thought goes into how they feel vs my need  to <br/>\ncontrol them. <br/>\nSome days they want to hold hands and others not. What&#39;s ok for one child  is <br/>\nnot the same for all.<br/>\nAs for seatbelts..Yes they are a safety issue but with independent  children <br/>\nwho buckle themselves there have been a couple times i looked back to  see one <br/>\nnot buckled. He&#39;s still alive but I look more now..  As an  <br/>\nunschooler/peaceful parent I would not force another persons child to  buckle up. I may not <br/>\ndrive until they are buckled but I have yet to see a  situation that cannot be <br/>\ndiscussed and worked through.. I think my kids as free  thinking beings may <br/>\nchallenge a rule but they would not go against another  family&#39;s &quot;rules&quot;. I can&#39;t <br/>\nknow what the mothers position was but respecting  children doesn&#39;t mean on <br/>\nwhoever&#39;s terms. I wouldn&#39;t say no more rides unless  the friendship wasn&#39;t <br/>\nworking but I would discuss it before a trip. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem is everyone has their own set of triggers. People with lots of  <br/>\ntriggers/rules will never be ok with unschooling , unschoolers or anyone that  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t follow mainstream.<br/>\nSome unschoolers don&#39;t allow their children to go to bed when they want bc  <br/>\nof their &quot;trigger&quot; or rule that it can cause illness,low growth  or..or..<br/>\nI&#39;ve even heard a mom say, as a radical  unschooler, that a fruit snack was <br/>\npoison and run across a room to  save their child from it. <br/>\nSooo... They are your children and no matter how good a parent you feel you  <br/>\nare inside you wont please everyone. It&#39;s all in the company you plan to  keep.<br/>\n <br/>\nNegligent for not wearing a helmet? I guess it depends where? <br/>\nComfort levels change/relax as we get older and or have more  children.<br/>\n <br/>\nLaura<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Safety issues are non-negotiable for me... like holding hands  when you <br/>\ncross<br/>\nthe street and bucking up in the car. So I was with another  unschooler. She<br/>\nand her child were riding with us and her daughter didn&#39;t  want to put on her<br/>\nseat belt. Her mother was fine with this but I wasn&#39;t  and I told her<br/>\ndaughter that I while I respect her right to make her own  choices and<br/>\ndecisions that if she wanted to ride with me that she would  have to put her<br/>\nseat beat on. That it wasn&#39;t safe to ride in a car without  your seat belt.<br/>\nIn the end it was my son who convinced her to put it on but  I don&#39;t turn the<br/>\ncar on unless everyone is buckled. The mother was not  happy that I &quot;forced&quot;<br/>\nher daughter to wear a seat belt and I am personally  appalled that she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. I think we both will have to think long and hard  about riding<br/>\ntogether next time.<br/>\nHas anyone else had issues with a  safety situation? I was not prepared this<br/>\ntime around for the situation.  Safety is really my one and only issue. If<br/>\nthere is something I don&#39;t want  my son to do it is because it isn&#39;t safe. As<br/>\nmy son is only five and half  and her daughter under eight - I think she is<br/>\nseven. I think safety should  be an issue - if my son gets hurt because I let<br/>\nhim do something that isn&#39;t  safe (like not wearing a helmet or his seat<br/>\nbeat), doesn&#39;t that make me  negligent?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere does unschooling sit on this subject?

We&#39;ve never really had buckling be an  <br/>\nissue either. But only because when my oldest was three and really  <br/>\nresisting the issue, I drove about a block down the street and did a  <br/>\n&#39;momentum check&#39;. Yes, momentum still works, and yes, you do fly  <br/>\nforward and hit the seat in front of you. It wasn&#39;t hard, it didn&#39;t  <br/>\nhurt him, but it did help him understand why buckling in is helpful ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow whenever one of the younger ones won&#39;t buckle in, we have a big  <br/>\ndiscussion about the laws of physics and momentum. We do the check  <br/>\nfor fun sometimes. We also learned about centripetal force at an  <br/>\nautocross one saturday...and on the roller coaster, and the  <br/>\nzipper....lol! Those are great ways to explain to kids why belts are  <br/>\nimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have the right to have people buckle in your car. As you  <br/>\nmention, it is more than just safety, it&#39;s the law as well. I think  <br/>\nyou handled it well, staying calm and saying the car doesn&#39;t go until  <br/>\nthe seats are buckled.

The mother was not happy that I &quot;forced&quot;<br/>\nher daughter to wear a seat belt and I am personally appalled that she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t. I think we both will have to think long and hard about riding<br/>\ntogether next time.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone else had issues with a safety situation? I was not prepared this<br/>\ntime around for the situation. Safety is really my one and only issue. If<br/>\nthere is something I don&#39;t want my son to do it is because it isn&#39;t safe. As<br/>\nmy son is only five and half and her daughter under eight - I think she is<br/>\nseven. I think safety should be an issue - if my son gets hurt because I let<br/>\nhim do something that isn&#39;t safe (like not wearing a helmet or his seat<br/>\nbeat), doesn&#39;t that make me negligent?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhere does unschooling sit on this subject?
