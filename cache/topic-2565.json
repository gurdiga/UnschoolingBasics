Last couple of months I think.<br/>\nLyle posted it I believe...it was about an intense conversation with his SIL at a restaraunt where she was going on about future success and how important a good education was and college and blah, blah, blah.<br/>\nApparently she knew the owner of this very successful restaraunt (but not well enough) and called him over to help make her point. She asked him to relate how important school is to success and his reply was something like &quot;This is America, you don&#39;t need school, I dropped out of High school...you just need to do what you love&quot; or something like that.<br/>\nDropped her jaw and ended the conversation I suppose.
