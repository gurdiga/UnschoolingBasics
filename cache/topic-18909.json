It is much more fun to head into the countryside and pet the cows when you pick up your raw milk, choose your veggies and fresh cut flowers at the farmer&#39;s market, and pick out your meat from the local butchers and chatting about all the yummy meals you&#39;ll make.<br/>\nI try to ask questions like, What do you feed them? Are they penned, pastured, barned? How many animals do you have? do you use Antibiotics? Can I come visit the farm? Personally, &quot;certified organic&quot; doesn&#39;t mean whit to me, other than the grower can afford the fees to the gov&#39;t. <br/>\nThis spring we plan on ordering about 25 broilers as I love chicken and refuse to buy it at a store and it can be expensive to buy natural. We have 7 (down from 10) hens that lay. (Well, they are supposed to lay but they just molted, and the days are shorter so they seem to have taken a hiatus. Lazy wenches) Broilers are a good animal to start with as they are not very sociable, are only around for a short time before taken to be processed and if you decide not to continue, the cost was not that high.<br/>\nThose not in the eastern panhandle of WV can ignorte the rest.<br/>\nShepherdstown Farmers market, which run through to December is fantastic. It&#39;s held on Sundays behing the library from 9 until 1&#39;ish<br/>\nD&D Meats on Rt 51 almost to Inwood provides  naturally raised meats from it&#39;s own farm. Prices are good. <br/>\nRidgefield orchards off Rt 230 between Charles Town and Sh-town is one place I like to go. The owners are friendly and knowledgeable about their produce and they have pick your own apples and pumpkins.<br/>\nI buy milk and butter from Tudor Hall Farm Market. They sell Trickling Springs Creamery  products which can be found all over the place. I&#39;m looking for a raw milk provider in the county if you ever come across one.<br/>\nThere are a few CSA&#39;s in the county too.<br/>\nElissa Jill<br/>\nA Kindersher saychel iz oychet a saychel.<br/>\n&quot;A Child&#39;s wisdom is also wisdom.&quot; ~Yiddish Proverb<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":268622920,"authorName":"Amy Mason","from":"Amy Mason &lt;doodlemakers@...&gt;","profile":"doodlemakers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re:OT - was The Green Life and Simple Living - vegetarian and more","postDate":"1163727063","msgId":18998,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ1NUQxMEQ3LjMwMDAwMDZAYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2NjMxNS41MzIzNi5xbUB3ZWIzMjQxMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDg2NjMxNS41MzIzNi5xbUB3ZWIzMjQxMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":18983,"nextInTopic":19005,"prevInTime":18997,"nextInTime":18999,"topicId":18909,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Leslie for that site...it s a real life altering read...along with other vegan sites I ve visited.
