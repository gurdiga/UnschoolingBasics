I had no idea how much time it would <br/>\ntake to &quot;deschool,&quot; I think we&#39;re still recovering from the <br/>\nexperience.  You mentioned that some of the social aspects of school <br/>\nwere less than ideal.  If your son was exposed to any kind of <br/>\nbullying - physical or psychological - this could also be <br/>\ncontributing to his moods.  And of course, there are plenty of what <br/>\nmy neighbor calls &quot;preteen moments.&quot; I&#39;ve done lots of reading to try <br/>\nto understand my daughter&#39;s negative school experiences (ever read <br/>\nabout the hidden culture of aggression in girls?) and help her <br/>\novercome some of the depression and uncomfortable feelings.  My son <br/>\nhates to write, and said he &quot;:hated learning&quot; at the end of the last <br/>\nschool year.  So I, too, have been swinging between &quot;should I push <br/>\nit?&quot; and &quot;Let him get to it in his own time, don&#39;t put him off.&quot;  <br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to stay in the latter end of the swing, but it&#39;s <br/>\nhard with that feeling that Big Brother is watching you.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave answers, just more questions, but I thought you might like to <br/>\nknow you&#39;re not the only one experiencing this and I have a feeling <br/>\nit may be a normal reaction to the &quot;healing from school&quot; process.  If <br/>\nit&#39;s any consolation, I think things have been getting easier - I&#39;ve <br/>\nespecially felt better since joining this group! It really does take <br/>\na long time, though.  I wish you the best.<br/>\nJennie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4860,"nextTopicId":4904}}
