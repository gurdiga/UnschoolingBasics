We have a house guest this week... a friend of my 14 yr old&#39;s <br/>\nis visiting us. The plan was for them to attend a zookeeper day camp <br/>\nthis week that they were both excited about. Today on the way my <br/>\ndaughter became ill , immediately our guest wanted to know if she HAD <br/>\nto attend the day camp alone (she is a very shy, anxious child who <br/>\nattends public school) . I asked her if she wanted to... her response <br/>\nwas &quot;No but you paid for me to go and I am not sick, my mom would <br/>\nmake me go but I don&#39;t want to go without Anna&quot; So I told her she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to go and that if Anna was well they could both go <br/>\ntomorrow (we were basically within sight of the zoo when Anna&#39;s <br/>\nnausea turned ugly so we drove in to tell them we were ill and <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t attend today) <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway this led to a discussion on the way home about arbitrary <br/>\n </span></blockquote>rules and respect etc. Every time this child comes to my house her <br/>\nmother says things like &quot;Well I told her she had to do this or that <br/>\nor to make sure with you about this or that etc... but she said it <br/>\nwould be fine because you are &#39;cool&#39; &quot; Not sure my friend likes that <br/>\nbut that is the view of her child regarding me. I asked B today on <br/>\nthe way back in the car how all the rules at her house made her feel. <br/>\nShe said they make her feel anxious and untrusted , that her mother <br/>\ntells her she is a good kid and then makes all kinds of rules and <br/>\nthat makes her feel like her mother is lying. Then I asked her about <br/>\nthe rules at my house....she said well the rules at your house make <br/>\nsense, they are rules that make everyone feel safe, protected and <br/>\ntrusted. We have very few rules and mostly they are rules of <br/>\nconsideration and rules of safety (like if you light a candle it <br/>\nshould be resting on something<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; inflammable like a saucer or candle holder.... my friend&#39;s rule <br/>\n </span></blockquote>would be don&#39;t light candles). Anyway I thought that was really <br/>\ninteresting since so many people say kids need rules they like rules <br/>\netc. A.S Neill (Summerhill) does say that kids like rules and will <br/>\nmake lots of rules for themselves (so we don&#39;t need to I think is <br/>\nwhat he is saying!). For years I have heard if kids don&#39;t have rules <br/>\nand limits they are unhappy. What I have seen proved to me over and <br/>\nover is that if kids are given arbitrary rules they feel untrusted ! <br/>\nNow I have proof directly from the mouth of a child who lives her <br/>\nlife bound by rules all made by other people. Interestingly enough <br/>\nshe lives with a step sister (same age) that sneaks, lies, cheats, <br/>\nbreaks rules, skips school, runs away, has been asked to leave two <br/>\nschools, and so on.... the parents&#39; answer to her behavior is to make <br/>\nmore rules! UGH! <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It just seems to me that if we give kids so many rules about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>sleeping, eating, behaving and everything else how will they ever <br/>\nlearn to make their own decisions?

Though she and I seem to think a lot alike, our kids have been raised very differently. Schedules and rules are the order of the day in her house, whereas in mine we fly by the seat of our pants most (okay, all) of the time. Our only rules are related to safety, consideration for others, and only recently have I needed to make a rule about staying seated while eating ( mealtime has been a little wild lately.) My son thinks, reasons things out, most all of the time, makes very good decisions. My niece, on the other hand, spends most of her time testing authority and rebelling against it. Thus, she is in &#39;time-out&#39; so often I can&#39;t help but shake my head. At this point, it seems past the point of no return. She has no sense of power, except through rebellion, which the adults want to squash, which leads to more powerlessness<br/>\n and rebellion, and on, and on. <br/>\n  One interesting note I&#39;d like to mention...I&#39;m a very free-flowing kind-of mom. But when she&#39;s here, she almost makes me want to impose strict rules on her, just to squeeze out some kind of reasonable behavior from her. (That implies she&#39;s not a bright kid... she is a VERY intelligent 4yo.) We&#39;ll be spending more time together now that it&#39;s summer,(I have her for a week in July) so wish me luck. I admit, I am eager to kind-of experiment with her to see if her behaviors would change in a different environment.    <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa Blocker &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jlblock01@...\">jlblock01@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          Just wanted to share an interesting situation with you guys.

My father is a <br/>\ngood man nevertheless and we loved him and respected him deeply, so <br/>\nwe didn&#39;t cheat, nor lie, but what I remember from my childhood is <br/>\nthis very strong feeling of powerlessness as I was completely <br/>\ndependant from other&#39;s judgement to know if what I was doing was good <br/>\nor bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reaction to that is that I try to limit the number of rules at <br/>\nhome with my kids and not to be too strict with them. I have <br/>\nrealised, though, that it is much more difficult than I thought and <br/>\nthat they also live in a place where they can be &quot;blamed&quot; for <br/>\nmistakes without really knowing why before.
