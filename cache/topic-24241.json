I play *both* roles (sometimes three or four, depending on the <br/>\nconversation! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a way for me to work out what I&#39;m thinking about. I examine things <br/>\nbetter when I can see it in my own handwriting and when I can hear my <br/>\nvoice. So I write and talk a LOT! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m with my animals (and years ago when I was with my babies), <br/>\nit&#39;s easy to claim that I&#39;m just talking to them. &lt;g&gt; But mostly, it&#39;s <br/>\njust *me*!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe ask your son what he&#39;s talking about. He may (or may not) have a <br/>\ndirect answer for you. But it helps me to concentrate and not lose my <br/>\ntrain of thought.

I think it is the best thing you can do for your kid. <br/>\n  I have a few questions for you. How long has your son been behaving this way?<br/>\n  Has your husband supported you in the beginning? If yes, what was his reasoning behind that? Remind him of those original views he had.<br/>\n  I know it is hard having to listen to a family member, specially a mother-in-law, who undermines your decision. Mine told me a few years ago, that once my children hit high school -age, I would not be smart enough to homeschool.<br/>\n  I am a college educated woman, a ordained minister, with my own business, and speak four languages, so you can see, that statements from others are not based on  facts, or your truth, but more from the fact, that they are defending their own truth. Go with your gut feeling. Do you feel, that your son is going through a stage? Do you feel there is something wrong with him? Quiet yourself for a moment, and see to what conclusion your intuition brings you.<br/>\n  If you want, you can e-mail me privately, and I can answer some of your questions in more detail. But most importantly, believe in yourself. I believe in you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Have a blessed day.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Rev.
