I&#39;ll <br/>\ntry to cover all the bases here!<br/>\n  When we 1st started Unschooling over a year ago, I felt exactly as <br/>\nyou do.  Even before that, it was like all I ever do is pick up after <br/>\neveryone all the time.  Clean here clean there, cook, laundry, etc.  <br/>\nBut the light at the end of the tunnel came when I was gone one day <br/>\nand came back home to find that my ds11 was loading the dishwasher <br/>\nand washing some pans in the sink.  He had cleaned the kitchen.  <br/>\nTotally came as a shock to me, but boy was I grateful for his help!  <br/>\nHe also cooks for us when the mood strikes, cleans his room , <br/>\nsometimes, and loves making cookies and homemade tortillas! And yes, <br/>\nI do just let him be, not &quot;making&quot; him do anything.  If I do need <br/>\nhelp, I ask, and since he is so busy all day, I ask in a way that <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t interfere with what he and his little brother are doing.  <br/>\nWhen he is online, I just remind him after so long that someone might <br/>\ncall or I need to use the phone, and when he gets to a stopping place <br/>\nto please find something else to do.  And all the while he is busy on <br/>\nline, usually with ds6, I have lots of time for me.  In fact i&#39;ve run <br/>\ninto days that I have almost too much time for me!  This is really <br/>\nnew, since it wasn&#39;t this way till I let go. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;I cleaned houses before I realized how much my family needed me <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and I needed them!  So I know that if you are like me, you probably <br/>\nsee more dirt then most people!  Now everyone else please don&#39;t take <br/>\nthat wrong, it seems to come with the territory.  So hearing your <br/>\ndaughter doesn&#39;t get all the places makes me think of this.  I know <br/>\nat her age I didn&#39;t get all my work done perfectly, and took alot of <br/>\nshort cuts to get out of it!  So maybe just ease up on her a bit when <br/>\nshe does help, letting her know you appriciate what she has done. And <br/>\ninstead of the roster, just explain that the more help you get from <br/>\nthem the more time you have to play, shop, or whatever it is you all <br/>\nenjoy doing together!  Its not 100% foolproof, we all have our days <br/>\nwhen we just don&#39;t want to do housework or chores.  But I bet if you <br/>\ngive it a try at least things will be more relaxed in the house. In <br/>\nthe meantime, keep reminding yourself that we all see more &quot;messes&quot; <br/>\nin our own homes then anyone comeing into them.  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Keep in mind also what you felt like at her age!  Can you imagin <br/>\n </span></blockquote>your mom talking to you like you are an adult and that your feelings <br/>\nof wanting to or not wanting to do something mattered?  I wish my <br/>\nparents had known about all this.  <br/>\n  I don&#39;t know if every woman feels this way, but I loved every one <br/>\nof my babies before birth.  I am sorry you lost yours. I don&#39;t feel a <br/>\nmiscarriage is any less then the loss of a person that does make it <br/>\ninto the world.  I lost one of my boys, my 1st born, at the age of <br/>\n18.  It&#39;ll be 4 years in February.  And I have to say, that if you <br/>\nknew what I know now, you probably would do anything and everything <br/>\nfor your dd. Learn to love the mess (on in my case, the very loud <br/>\nmusic, the guitar that played non stop ) becuz it can ALL stop in the <br/>\nblink of an eye. And so now, with his brothers, all those things that <br/>\nbothered me so much before and things that remind me that they are <br/>\nhere, and healthy, and ohhhh so busy!  And even though it gets to me <br/>\non days to have to be the one to take care of it all, I just look at <br/>\na photo on the wall, smile, and keep picking up their &quot;stuff&quot;<br/>\nSyndi and sons, Kaleb 11 and Isaiah 6  and our angel Josh, now 23, <br/>\nplayin that sweet sweet music for the Lord now.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Laundry; was consensus or: her freedom versus mine? long-sorry","postDate":"1101500777","msgId":4147,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMTI2MjAyNjA4LkNHVlYxNDQzOC5tdGE5LmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDVGMTU4OTExLTNGQTItMTFEOS04N0I1LTAwMDM5M0RBMjZGMkBwYXJhZGlzZS5uZXQubno+"},"prevInTopic":4146,"nextInTopic":4149,"prevInTime":4146,"nextInTime":4148,"topicId":4081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wish I had more time right now to respond, but I don t.

Yes, I agree that <br/>\nit isn&#39;t worth ruining one&#39;s relationship over chores issues, but I <br/>\nfeel there has to be a balance. I&#39;m reading S. Neill&#39;s Freedom not <br/>\nlicence at the moment. I agree with S. Neill that children should have <br/>\nfreedom to make choices but that doesn&#39;t mean they choose to do nothing <br/>\nand  I have to do all the work for them. I have the same freedom too.<br/>\nIf my dd is on the internet for hours and blocks the phone line my <br/>\nfriends can&#39;t get hold of me. That&#39;s my freedom to have use of that <br/>\nphone line gone. When she doesn&#39;t help I end up spending my little <br/>\nspare time doing it for her when I want to have a little &#39;freedom&#39; time <br/>\nfor me too. When they&#39;re babies, I clothes them, but as soon as they&#39;re <br/>\nable to do it themselves, I stop  because they tell me to. My 5.5yo dd <br/>\nloves helping me. She loves cleaning etc, but after a while that wears <br/>\noff when they get older.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I don&#39;t actually mind doing household jobs despite cleaning other <br/>\npeoples houses for 4 hours a week to finance my 5.5yo dd violin <br/>\nlessons, I still don&#39;t mind doing it. What I mind is when I&#39;m the only <br/>\none and loose out on time for my hobbys etc.  I feel I have a right too <br/>\nto a little time for my own interests  just like all other members of <br/>\nthe fam. If my dd has a busy time, I help her and do things for her, <br/>\njust like I do for my dh or my younger dd. But when they&#39;re not busy, I <br/>\ncan&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with working out a roster so that everyone does <br/>\ntheir bit in the running of the household. I don&#39;t like going round <br/>\ntelling my dd what to do.She usually does what I ask for but I want  <br/>\nall of us to work out who does what so things get done without me <br/>\nhaving to do them or ask people/remind them. My dd agrees with me that <br/>\nit is only fair that we all do our share. Problem is, that&#39;s the <br/>\ntheory. In practice she chooses to spend her time reading or being on <br/>\nthe pc etc rather than doing the bit she has agreed to do. We went <br/>\nthrough all the jobs that need doing and talked about who could do <br/>\nwhat. She volunteered to do the laundry but in practice she really <br/>\nisn&#39;t able to do it as she&#39;s not here in the day to do it. So that left <br/>\nonly the jobs she doesn&#39;t like doing. I&#39;m more than happy to do the <br/>\njobs she doesn&#39;t like if she does something else instead. Trouble is, <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t like doing anything else either.  So now we take turns to <br/>\ndo the chores. Every 3rd week it&#39;s her turn to do the vacuuming for <br/>\nexample (the other 2 it&#39;s me and dh), but she never does it unless I <br/>\nask her to.  Even then, she says yes but doesn&#39;t start. Then she <br/>\nstarts, but leaves out lots of areas (she says she forgets, but she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to write herself a list either so she doesn&#39;t forget). <br/>\nWhen we talked about what other job she&#39;d like to do because she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like vaccuuming, she couldn&#39;t think about anything. I was very <br/>\nopen to brainstorming innovative solutions but she doesn&#39;t participate. <br/>\nSo the active listening and win win solutions stuff form the P.E.T. <br/>\nbook by T. Gordon didn&#39;t work for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above logic (I choose to remember that messes around me equal love <br/>\naround me ..)reminds me of the saying : eat up because there&#39;s lots of <br/>\npeople starving. Be thankful that you have a child, that&#39;s she&#39;s <br/>\nhealthy, that they live with you. Yes, I am. Does that mean I forgo my <br/>\nneeds and do everything my kids don&#39;t feel like doing?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a personal story too. I had a miscarriage and the day after 14 <br/>\nyoung people died not far from us because a viewing platform collapsed. <br/>\nI was talking to my midwife and said  that I almost felt I had no right <br/>\nto grieve over my loss as I never knew this child, it was never born, <br/>\nnever lived and I had another chance. Yet here were 14 sets of parents <br/>\ngrieving over the loss of their children. Children they had lived with <br/>\nfor 17 plus years. My midwife said that just because there was other <br/>\ntragedy in life it didn&#39;t mean my loss was less real, was less <br/>\njustified, was less acute.<br/>\nJust because I love my dd to bits, am thankful that she is in my life, <br/>\nthat she is healthy and happy doesn&#39;t mean I need to do everything for <br/>\nher, does it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is probably premature, but this week I started the food freedom <br/>\nthing. We had some left over chocolate from making Santa Sleighs with <br/>\ncandy sticks :-) and divided them up. My 5.5.yo dd told me today she <br/>\nwant&#39;s to go back to being aloud only some after dinner because she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like it that she eats them up all at once and then has nothing <br/>\nleft the rest of the days.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not writing all this because I&#39;m convinced that my argument is <br/>\nright.<br/>\nThat&#39;s just how I see it atm but I like to see another view on things.  <br/>\nI would much rather that I give my dc as much freedom as possible, if <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t mean I pick the short straw.....<br/>\nAm I  premature in  my expectation that my 14yo dd can take on more of <br/>\na share of the household jobs as her freedom in her life also <br/>\nincreases? Can&#39;t freedom and responsibility go hand in hand?<br/>\nI could choose to do the jobs for her, pick up her stuff, put away her <br/>\nstuff.

I&#39;ll be <br/>\nbrief.<br/>\nI was doing laundry one night, at my parents house while we were <br/>\nvisiting Alaska. I was tired and not feeling like doing laundry at <br/>\nthe moment, but we all needed clothes. I started folding some of my <br/>\nMums laundry and had one of those lovely paradigm shifts.<br/>\nIt was a bittersweet moment....all that jumbled laundry suddenly <br/>\ntook on a new significance. It represented all of my loved ones and <br/>\nthe fact that they were with me. I realized I might not have the <br/>\nprivilege of caring for my mother and doing her laundry much longer <br/>\n(she was battling breast cancer at the time).<br/>\nNow that my mother is gone, I remember that moment. I&#39;d fold her <br/>\nlaundry joyfully every day if it meant having her with me again. I <br/>\nknow laundry is such a pitifully small thing when in light of death.<br/>\nI don&#39;t always remember this lesson, but if I slow down and treat <br/>\neach moment mindfully, I know that the love we share, the good <br/>\nmemories I help create and all the time we spend together, should <br/>\nnever be marred by dirty laundry.<br/>\nRelationships are interesting things....you can add to them or take <br/>\naway, each day, each moment we have choices about this.<br/>\nI choose to make laundry less important than my relationship with my <br/>\nchildren.<br/>\nI choose joy, even in the mundane tasks.<br/>\nI choose to remember that messes around me equal love around me.:)<br/>\nEach toy, each dirty shirt, each dish, a powerful reminder that <br/>\ntheir are living beings with me that I love spending my days with.<br/>\nI thank the stars for these daily reminders.<br/>\n(yeah, and sometimes at night, I exhaustedly pick up toys and sigh. <br/>\nBeing mindful takes a bit of effort and I&#39;m certainly not perfect)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all perspective.<br/>\nAnd interestingly enough, my children who are ALWAYS free to choose <br/>\nwhatever food they want, will ask for healthy foods. They listen to <br/>\ntheir bodies quite beautifully. My children with no chores will <br/>\nhappily help me when I request it. They&#39;ll even do stuff without <br/>\nbeing asked, because they ARE truly free.<br/>\nWe have another unshcooling Mum staying here temporarily and she <br/>\nasked the boys to let her know when they were done in the kitchen so <br/>\nshe could clean up.<br/>\nA bit later,she realized that the water had been running. She looks <br/>\ninto the kitchen and Trevor and Jared are washing dishes. No one <br/>\nasked them to, they just knew it was a nice thing to do for this <br/>\nperson. <br/>\nIt comes from within, they have a desire to help because no one is <br/>\nforcing things on them.<br/>\nThey trust my advice because I try to truly give them ALL <br/>\nalternative and they know when I say &quot;I think this is best&quot;, I&#39;m not <br/>\ntrying to manipulate them, I&#39;m trying to help.<br/>\nThat trust took a long time to build,because I wasn&#39;t always like <br/>\nthis. I had to undo a lot of damage in order to build the kind of <br/>\ntrust we talk about here at this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I&#39;ll be a bit coercive if my child is truly in danger. So far <br/>\nthey haven&#39;t balked when their bodies need help.<br/>\nOh wait, there was one time a Dr. wanted to have a urine sample and <br/>\none of my kids refused. We went home and never did get that urine <br/>\nsample...he&#39;s fine. If he&#39;d been in pain, it might have changed his <br/>\nmind, he wasn&#39;t.<br/>\nAnyhoo, I know the level of respect we talk about here can be <br/>\nbaffling sometimes. That&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to clarify though, you ARE an unschooler if you don&#39;t do <br/>\nschool and allow your children to learn through life. These other <br/>\nissues are an extension of unschooling and the philosophies we hold <br/>\ndear. But they greatly affect how unschooling unfolds and this list <br/>\nis here to help people explore this kind of parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know several of the people here from real life, and they would <br/>\nnever allow their child to truly endanger themselves. I think most <br/>\nof us would say that psychological trauma is far more toxic than <br/>\nmany other forms of &quot;endangerment&quot; (like teeth problems). My kids <br/>\nare smart, capable human beings. They will make good choices (with <br/>\nguidance) for their own lives. Maybe different choices than I&#39;d <br/>\nmake, but I trust that they know themselves. So far, my trust has <br/>\nbeen proven right on, over and over and over again. Their trust in <br/>\nme has grown because of that and we have a very good environment for <br/>\ntrue discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I&#39;ve gotten off the laundry issue quite a bit! sorry.<br/>\nBut there&#39;s been a lot of talk suddenly and all these thoughts are <br/>\nswirling around in my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nFreedom doesn&#39;t equal kids eating crappy foods all the time, or <br/>\nmaking crappy choices about their health. It&#39;s hard to describe just <br/>\nhow it works, but it DOES work. I&#39;ve seen it in my own family, and <br/>\nhundreds of others. <br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4143,"nextTopicId":4161}}
