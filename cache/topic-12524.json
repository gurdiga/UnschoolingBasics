Nice to meet you! <br/>\n <br/>\nto get started, well for me, it took a few things (and I consider myself  <br/>\nstill in the act of starting, too). <br/>\n <br/>\n1. Acknowledging your child&#39;s needs (you got that!)<br/>\n2. Knowing options are there (you got that too!)<br/>\n3. Having the confidence to trust and be open, so you can continue to  listen <br/>\nto your son with more than your ears - so you can say to those naysayers,  <br/>\n&quot;Ha! This&#39;ll be great. Just you watch!&quot; ;) (and you WILL have that,  really!)<br/>\n <br/>\nHonestly? Keep reading. Here, other lists maybe, books, all the blogs fro  <br/>\nthe parents here...and let your son just BE for a bit. He may need 4-5 months or <br/>\n longer before he sees his own sense of trust and love of learning return. (I <br/>\n heard an average type number is as many years as they were conventionally  <br/>\nschooled, will be as many months as they need to decompress - give or take - <br/>\nand  I THINK that&#39;s what I heard, lol!) <br/>\n <br/>\nFamily members can be told, &quot;I appreciate your concern and I will take that  <br/>\ninto consideration.&quot; and then be DONE with it. <br/>\n <br/>\nThis is fun. I&#39;ve never been able to let go and love and enjoy my children  <br/>\nin this way before. I was too busy molding them...or so I thought. Now, they  <br/>\nhelp mold me. We are a unit in our individuality. <br/>\n <br/>\nHave fun with this new direction your lives are taking. It&#39;s a wonderful  <br/>\nride.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140736384,"authorName":"Debi","from":"&quot;Debi&quot; &lt;liddledevlangel@...&gt;","profile":"ohnomyhalosliped","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"My introduction","postDate":"1186505583","msgId":25572,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5YTgxZitlZGtpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":12748,"nextInTopic":25577,"prevInTime":25571,"nextInTime":25573,"topicId":12524,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My name is Debi.

They  have a <br/>\nbody intelligence most of us do not, standardized tests might tell these  <br/>\npeople that they are dumb.  Someone else might be *gifted* to work with  elderly <br/>\nor people with diminished mental capacity and make an amazing  contribution to <br/>\nthe world, but still be less intelligence in reading and  math.....basically <br/>\nthe only two intelligences that are standardized  tested.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere is a great essay about standardized testing by David  Albert.  It is in <br/>\nhis book &quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of  Self-Discovery&quot;.   It is very <br/>\nfunny; he is taking questions in his  daughter&#39;s test and showing how every <br/>\nquestion could have multiple correct  answers or be completely ridiculous to ask a <br/>\nfourth grader.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI remember taking a standardized test in sixth grade and getting a taste of  <br/>\n&quot;what does this have to do with anything????&quot;  The question asked which  <br/>\nmilitary rank was the highest from four choices.  I remember being quite  angry, <br/>\nhow the hell was I supposed to know?  I knew no one in the military  and my only <br/>\nexposure was watching the show m*a*s*h*.  We hadn&#39;t been  studying military <br/>\nrank in school, either.  I went home and probably cried  to my mother that I <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t be penalized for just not being exposed to  something yet!<br/>\n <br/>\nPreparing my ground for unschooling, probably!  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nOh, also read some John Taylor Gatto.

My name is Daneyl and I am married to a wonderful man, George, for 11 years now. I have 2 children, 10 yo dd, Kaylee, and 8 yo ds, Colton. Right now my children go to a very small (2 classrooms per grade) public school. I am very happy with this school, they have the highest test scores in the county. However, next year is my dd&#39;s last year at this school and she will be traveling 30 minutes one way to go to the middle school. I am not looking forward to this at all.  I have been doing some research on the unschooling method and I am very interested in it. So basically I&#39;m starting from the beginning on this: figuring out exactly what unschooling is, how it works, what is the outcome of families who have done it for years, etc. So basically I&#39;m looking for any information, suggestions, tips, anything you all can give me. Thank you so much for letting me be a part of this group and I look forward to talking to all of you.<br/>\n    Daneyl<br/>\n<br/>\n              <br/>\n  ---------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!
