I  am not sure I can put it into words. I<br/>\nguess I just mean that they spend ALOT of time playing &quot;make believe&quot;<br/>\nand while their game are really cool and I know they are learning I am<br/>\nsometimes afraid that the younger one doesn&#39;t get to do alot of what<br/>\nshe is interested in because the older is very dominate. The only time<br/>\nthey seperate is if they are not getting along and that is mostly<br/>\nbecause my younger( Maddy) is fed up with  ( Sara&#39;s) control over all<br/>\ntheir games. Does that make any sense?<br/>\nDanette<br/>\nSorry I son&#39;t know how to just highlight the part that I am responding<br/>\nto. Can anyone tell me hoe to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &lt;aycock@b...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Danette - Welcome to the group!
