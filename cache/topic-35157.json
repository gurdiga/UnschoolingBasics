I have the same thing and there are still sometimes I have<br/>\nproblems or I make up words usually the blending of two similar meaning<br/>\nwords to fit my meaning but not done intentionally. My son has taken to<br/>\nenunciating words for me when I miss something which I need to not let me<br/>\nupset me because he is only doing what I have done for him and he is only<br/>\ntrying to help. It is not just the motor it is the conduit from the brain to<br/>\nthe mouth. Imagine a subway with too many people so full that the people<br/>\ncannot move. Practice helped me a lot but I was only receptive when I found<br/>\nsomething I wanted. Doctor Seuss books read aloud helped a lot and we still<br/>\ndo - now my son is taking joy in taking turns doing it and no one can do an<br/>\nentire book at an insane pace perfectly. Getting the word in the eye to the<br/>\nbrain, process, translate and to the mouth is a lot of work so find things<br/>\nthat make it fun or at least make it a mommy/daddy and me thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShannon <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n[mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of gailbrocop@...<br/>\nSent: Wednesday, August 06, 2008 12:07 PM<br/>\nTo: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Looking for insight! - Long!
