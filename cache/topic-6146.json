He lives with  <br/>\nhis feminist lesbian moms, and he&#39;s a musician into heavy metal music. I&#39;ll  <br/>\nlisten to music he wants to share, we have long conversations about who has  <br/>\ntalent and who doesn&#39;t, etc. The other night he put on an MTV show called Metal  <br/>\nAsylum with videos. We watched a couple, including one song with the disturbing <br/>\n title &quot;Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads&quot; by It Dies Today. <br/>\n <br/>\nNow, despite his taste in music, Julian is a sweet, mellow guy. Not being a  <br/>\nproponent of violence against women, he wasn&#39;t impressed with the message in <br/>\nthe  song. Plus, he added, the band really sucks. LOL<br/>\n <br/>\nListen with her, let her teach you stuff, and talk. Julian is NOT into  <br/>\nhip-hop, but we were very impressed recently when Kanye West called for rappers  <br/>\nand hip-hoppers to stop gay bashing.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6145,"nextTopicId":6152}}
