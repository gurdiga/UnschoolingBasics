I definitely rephrased what you said poorly<br/>\nusing the word &quot;have&quot;, and in my mind I definitely wasn&#39;t thinking that you<br/>\nsaid or that I would believe that the adult would choose what&#39;s too scary<br/>\nand what&#39;s not, just that the adult would be aware and talk about it with<br/>\ntheir child.  I would not stop my daughter from watching something she<br/>\nwished to if she wanted to try it because I thought it was too scary.  I<br/>\nwould only explain why I was concerned about it - it would definitely be up<br/>\nto her to choose unless there was an issue with her brother feeling<br/>\nthreatened by it which might mean seeing it while he was asleep or<br/>\ndistracting him or some such.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is my own ongoing challenge that my daughter is more sensitive than any<br/>\nother child I have met so far in regards not only to TV, but to books and<br/>\nother materials.  She is not reading yet, and before asking for anything to<br/>\nbe read to her insists on looking through it at all the pictures to see if<br/>\nshe thinks it would be &quot;too scary&quot;.  For this reason, much to my husband&#39;s<br/>\ndismay as he is a librarian, she has no interest in storytime at the<br/>\nlibrary - too big of a risk it might be something scary.  If I read a book<br/>\naloud to my son and she doesn&#39;t want to hear it, she goes to another room<br/>\nand I make sure I read softly.  Because she not only watches, but feels she<br/>\nis living in the video, like the books, she finds an amazing (to me) list of<br/>\nthings scary including even some of the mildest children&#39;s videos out<br/>\nthere - even one Little Bear episode made her list.  Anything representative<br/>\nof adult crankiness and insensitivity seems to set her off, although she<br/>\noften asks and we discuss &quot;why&quot; it happened that way if she happens to see<br/>\nit.  As she gets older, she seems to take some of it more in stride.<br/>\nPersonally I do not question what she finds scary or not scary - if she<br/>\nfinds it scary, then it is and we go from there, although sometimes I see if<br/>\nshe would like to discuss what she finds scary about it to see if that helps<br/>\nher feel better in a given situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has not had anything on a video that has given her nightmares for weeks,<br/>\nalthough she has seen things that have sent her out of the room screaming<br/>\n(like the mean witch on &quot;Dora Saves the Prince&quot;), and by saying that in my<br/>\npost, I may simply be expressing an unrealistic worry of mine - we are<br/>\ncurrently trying to handle a situation where she felt threatened by the<br/>\nbehavior of some other children while in a childcare situation during<br/>\nregular 3 hour meetings we attended - she found the behavior scary and the<br/>\nproviders there did not help her feel safe, and she has had recurrent<br/>\nnightmares about that going on 3 months now.  So I have likely put my own<br/>\nstruggles and fears into my rephrase and not anything well thought out about<br/>\nvideos, and certainly not anything reflective of what you wrote!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Ren Allen [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, June 18, 2004 11:33 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] TV-issues of impact beyond good and evil<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In our house we have found several<br/>\nissues -<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; in addition to the one Ren talked about - the fact that you<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; your sensitive children watch things that would traumatize them and<br/>\n </span></blockquote>give<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them nightmares for weeks (and my daughter gets too scared to watch<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Disney<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; movies so that is a big consideration around here).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I need to clarify.<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; my child watch anything.
