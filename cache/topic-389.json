The kids and I discussed the options that were suggested by the group, and they chose to lock their door to the crowd of kids. They were so much more content before, during, and afterwards. My 10yo dd enjoyed herself, without trying to protect all her things. My 8yo ds felt good about because he didn&#39;t have to clean up his room.

I thought that was a wonderful decision they made. Because it was thoughtful, informed, and their own decision. They were able to enjoy the people they were with. They have matured so much in the short time I have stepped into this world (2 months). Well, more like plunged in. I have been reading ferociously on this board and several others you folks have mentioned. I can&#39;t seem to get enough... So as a new idea makes sense, which at this point in my life it is a short trip, we add that idea in to our life. My family and friends think I have gone off into the deep end, since things have changed so suddenly, in their eyes. And I have! No apologies. <br/>\nI couldn&#39;t possibly go into all the areas radical unschooling has affected. The most important part is our relationship has gone through a lot of healing since I took the unschooling/radicle unschooling red pill. My dd feels free to bring up LOTS of older things I used to do that she saw as unjust. And there are lots more she could say if she remembered them :( The kids are more understanding with one another, and their little sister... <br/>\nI just appreciate all the help you all give. All the honest experiences, the time it takes to reply to everyone. My kids are happy with their home life, which, to be completely honest, is something I never thought a parent could experience. Especially a home schooling parent. Especially Charlotte Mason method following parent from a pretty hard core Mason group. The kids just withered. They were miserable. To the fullest sense of the word. There was so much resentment towards me. After a long grueling day of lessons, we all fled from one another to find our routes to happiness. Now we simply enjoy the whole day together. No strings attached. They are just beginning to trust that I am not about to lecture them, sneak a lesson in, guilt trip them, grill them on what they know about a book (narration is the code word for it)... I could go on and on about how there natures are flourishing... But from the deepest part of my heart, thank you. <br/>\nI have spent way to long on this post. Better go hang out with my kiddos :)<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nMelissa in AL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Thanks","postDate":"1167942955","msgId":20257,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVuam9mYitvazJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMjAwMWM3MmZiOCQ0NjdiNmI5MCQ2NDAxYThjMEBUZXJyaT4="},"prevInTopic":20245,"nextInTopic":48157,"prevInTime":20256,"nextInTime":20258,"topicId":389,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Terri, May I suggest reading some of the older threads and also poking around the link section?

After reading your responses, I started to think <br/>\nabout dinner time not in terms of how to make it happen the way I <br/>\nwant, but in terms of how what we do has been making us all feel. I <br/>\nrealized we&#39;ve been separating the family (so that one parent can <br/>\ncook while the other keeps the kids occupied) at the end of the day <br/>\nwhen dh has just come home from work. We&#39;re going to try bringing the <br/>\nkids into the kitchen/dining room and cooking together while they <br/>\nstart eating. <br/>\n<br/>\nthanks again,<br/>\naj</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48159,"nextTopicId":48115}}
