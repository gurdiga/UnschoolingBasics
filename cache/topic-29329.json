While the swearing itself is no longer an issue, I think its<br/>\npretty likely that she&#39;s having contact with other adults in the<br/>\nworld, and perhaps even other children, who are demanding that she<br/>\nstop doing this or that, and providing no other reason than that they<br/>\ndon&#39;t like it.<br/>\nSo it is as if she is asking you &quot;How do you deal with this?&quot; in<br/>\nexperiential terms, since she perhaps is not yet capable of<br/>\nconceptualizing and verbalizing this.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if it is possible to tell whether this is what is really<br/>\ngoing on, but thinking of it as if it were may lead to some<br/>\ninteresting new choices about how to respond to her. For example, I<br/>\nwould be inclined to explain that we are sometimes willing to change<br/>\nour behavior for someone whom we are in a relationship with for no<br/>\nbetter reason than that they don&#39;t like it, because we value our<br/>\nrelationship with them and want them to feel comfortable with us;<br/>\nother times we feel it is too much to ask for us to change our<br/>\nbehavior, and we prefer them to change theirs instead - in the form of<br/>\nlearning to accept ours. And as a parent we sometimes ask our children<br/>\nto change their behavior, or even insist that they do, not only<br/>\nbecause it bugs us, but because we believe it will be helpful or even<br/>\nnecessary for them to get along in the world. So at this point asking<br/>\nyour daughter to accept your swearing is another request to change her<br/>\nbehavior; partly because it bugs you, but also because its pretty<br/>\nclear that that kind of behavior is going to bug other people too. Its<br/>\na bit awkward, in that its a reversal of your previous request/demand,<br/>\nbut perhaps that can also be used as an opportunity to admit that yes,<br/>\nmom makes mistakes sometimes, or at any rate needs to fine-tune her<br/>\nrequests (what was appropriate for one age may not be appropriate for<br/>\nanother) and that her feedback about this is valued.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Mark V.<br/>\n(still working on creating a profile/blogspot)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Amanda Horein&quot; &lt;horein@...&gt;<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; When my oldest (7.5) was just starting to talk we did the &quot;no,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>that&#39;s a bad<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; word&quot; thing and she caught on REALLY fast.

Extended <br/>\nfamily members might use something at times but, it seems, as long <br/>\nas it didn&#39;t come from *us* (me and DH), DS ignored it. Then, when <br/>\nhe was maybe 6ish, we had guests over one evening for dinner. DH, <br/>\nDS, and one of the guests were playing a videogame and DS&#39; <br/>\ncharacter &quot;died&quot;. He said &#39;Damn&#39; - startled the heck out of me since <br/>\nI&#39;d NEVER heard him say that EVER before then. The sudden <br/>\ngrownup &#39;hush&#39; that fell over the room upset DS and he went to his <br/>\nroom and requested privacy for a bit (I checked on him and that&#39;s <br/>\nwhat he wanted). He came down a bit later and still beat both adults <br/>\nat the game even with the time gap:-) For days afterward, though, he <br/>\nwas quite rude and unusually aggressive with DH.

DS was <br/>\nupset that there were some words grownups could say but kids <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t - apparently during a vexing repair around the house, DH <br/>\nhad said Damn. I told DS that sometimes things slip out, adults or <br/>\nkids, and what should we do about that situation. He said we should <br/>\nuse food words because kids can say them - so things like Popcorn! <br/>\nFudge! Peanut butter! were okay. Fine and dandy with me. Also, we <br/>\nagreed that anything he heard us say, he was free to say as well. I <br/>\nrelayed the info to DH and he was fine with it too.
