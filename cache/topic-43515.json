Please feel free to share the information!<br/>\nGreat Big Happy Life Unschooling Conference Retreat News    <br/>\nFrom: Jennifer Johnson <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Pnkn314@...\">Pnkn314@...</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nHello to Unschooling Families Everywhere!<br/>\n<br/>\nHi- I am Jen - unschooling mama to two always unschooled kids -and we are<br/>\nexpecting our third this fall.<br/>\nMy husband Chris and I (along with all the others who are helping to pull<br/>\nthis together!) are delighted to announce that 2nd annual Great Big Happy Life Unschoolers Conference Retreat is ON! <br/>\n<br/>\nJune 7-10, 2010.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis extraordinary gathering of unschooling families has a new home this<br/>\nyear- a gorgeous camp in West Milford NJ. The accommodations are perfect for<br/>\nfamilies as we will be taking over the building which holds the dining hall,<br/>\na fireplace, 3 sunny workrooms, a comfy loft with many couches and huge TV<br/>\nand a beautiful wraparound deck for sitting and enjoying your morning. We<br/>\nwill enjoy private, simple, spotless dormitory style rooms.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe camp has a beautiful lake and waterfront activities will be an option<br/>\nfor all of us to enjoy. <br/>\nImagine three nights on a beautiful campus with hiking trails, abundant<br/>\nwildlife, simple & pleasant accommodations and 3 delicious catered family friendly meals prepared by our cherished caterer! <br/>\n<br/>\nThe festivities begin on Monday afternoon with a welcome gathering and<br/>\nsnack. <br/>\nWe plan to offer massages by the minute on arrival day so that you can<br/>\ncompletely feel like you are really away on vacation! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe will, once again, host 8 minute dating for families Monday evening <br/>\n(which everyone loved participating in!)- followed by delicious dinner and a<br/>\ncampfire. <br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday and Wednesday will be a combination of planned and spontaneous<br/>\ngatherings for kids and parents. There will be a 24 hour gaming room,<br/>\ndesignated teen hangout, funshops on everything from firebuilding to Qi<br/>\nGong, unschooling lifeshops, discussion rings centered on peaceful<br/>\npartnerships, chances to deepen your exploration of unschooling while<br/>\nsharing meals and wide open spaces with other like-minded families, and<br/>\nopportunities to ask questions as you absorb the joy, at least for a few<br/>\ndays, of living in a little Unschooling Village. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be whole sections of the day for exploration and just being with<br/>\nour families- sort of an unconference feel. This year we are emphasizing the<br/>\nretreat experience of Great Big Happy Life- use this time as a chance to<br/>\nboth reignite your unschooling spirit and reconnect with yourself and your<br/>\nchildren in a free and unbounded environment. Think of it as a chance to<br/>\ntake a really DEEP breath and EXHALE. Ahh...<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Big Happy Life would like to extend our joyful invitation to ALL<br/>\npersons and families who would like to deepen their unschooling experience-<br/>\nWe strive to create a conference retreat that will embrace people of all<br/>\nsizes, colors, ethnic backgrounds, religious/spiritual choices, sexual<br/>\norientations, genders, abilities and cultures. We also wish to extend an<br/>\ninvitation to all unschooling families- regardless of where you are on your<br/>\njourney.<br/>\nOur website is www.greatbighappylife.com and registration is open. We are<br/>\nadding exciting things each day!<br/>\nOur yahoo group is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJUC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NJUC/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a deadline to register of May 1st, 2010, but if you want an indoor<br/>\nroom (vs tent camping), we suggest booking your accommodations before then because there are only 20 family rooms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope to see you in June - It&#39;s A Great Big Happy Life!<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer & Chris<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Pnkn314@...\">Pnkn314@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43513,"nextTopicId":43472}}
