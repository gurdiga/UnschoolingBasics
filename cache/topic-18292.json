My parents would help me define my <br/>\nemotions, using terms like, &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel&quot; at the right time. <br/>\nInstead of saying &quot;I feel like he&#39;s being mean.&quot; I would be asked <br/>\nif &quot;I felt mad and thought he was being mean&quot; was more what I was <br/>\ntrying to say. They were real big on helping me find the real issue. <br/>\nIt was fine if I wanted to smack my brother in the head, but I <br/>\nlearned to tell him instead of do it most times. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny part is, that when all else failed, and because of <br/>\nviolence or failed discussion, my parents were brought in, we <br/>\nthought that was punishment! We all agreed on one thing, that it was <br/>\neasier to work it out somehow, even if it meant a difficult <br/>\ncompromise. Not because my parent would be angry or anything, it was <br/>\njust that they had us work it out with so much talking and listening <br/>\nto each other. We were even taught the old, &quot;hit the pillow instead <br/>\nof the person&quot;. I still use that when I release the urge for <br/>\nphysical anger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if I think that is good or bad, I still use all of it <br/>\nin my own way with my children. But I didn&#39;t know I was an <br/>\nunschooler until my oldest was in 2nd grade, I just thought I was a <br/>\nbad homeschooler! :)<br/>\n<br/>\npeace,<br/>\nWildflower</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18305,"nextTopicId":18097}}
