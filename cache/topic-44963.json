I don&#39;t like how I can become so reactive to her and it is true, I need to be more attentive. I feel so fed up at times that all I want to do is sit with my laptop while she and her brother seem to be getting along but it quickly escalates and usually ends in her screaming at him, hitting and then running to a different room and him crying for me. It seems like she is starting to see herself in a negative light and I&#39;m so sad because I know that it coming from how I respond to her lately. Ironically, I am now on the computer seeking the support from you guys when I probably need to be with her...but I&#39;m trying to learn new ways to respond to her to stop damaging our relationship...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am definitely going to post about the sibling issues when I get a chance.

She has big feelings, so she uses the biggest words and phrases she has, in terms of their impact, to express them. In 4yo terms, &quot;bad mommy&quot; is about the worst cuss imaginable! So its important to respond to all that emotion without getting tangled up in the grown-up baggage tied to those words.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s a little bitty person in a world that&#39;s too big and complex for her to deal with all on her own - that&#39;s rough. Its easy to forget that its hard to be a little kid, and some kids have a much harder time Being little, being children! than others. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you ever swear? If not, maybe you could start - when something goes wrong from her perspective, exclaim &quot;Tartar Sauce&quot; or whatever you like. That&#39;s something for you to experiment with, rather than trying to explain to her that you don&#39;t like her words - offer her different words by the simple expedient of exclaiming them yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I cringe frequently around others...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you ever heard a cop say &quot;you can&#39;t let other people do your driving for you&quot;? That&#39;s a line I&#39;ve held in mind more than once! And really, it doesn&#39;t Help to think about what others are thinking and saying - what helps is focusing on the needs of your child in the moment. Its so easy to get wrapped up in grown-up thoughts and expectations and forget how the world can seem to someone who&#39;s little and relatively helpless still - easy to forget just How helpless a 4yo still is! She doesn&#39;t get to forget that, though - and she doesn&#39;t appreciate your forgetting either because that leaves her even more helpless. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I feel embarrassed when she makes remarks like &quot;Eww that&#39;s gross&quot; after a friend makes her a dinner that she said she wanted or &quot;I hate ___&quot; if they do something she does not care for.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nSay the kinder thing for your daughter. She&#39;s not ready to manage her big feelings and being polite about others&#39; feelings yet, so help her out - say &quot;woops, I&#39;m sorry, its not what she thought it would be&quot; or words to that effect. Mo&#39;s a veeeeery conservative eater, so I&#39;ve developed some practice at soothing the ruffled feelings of ladies who want to cook for her. It does take some practice not to take the traditional path of &quot;she made it so you have to eat it&quot; but it absolutely makes for warmer relationships over time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; And I&#39;m so tired of her hitting and pushing her brother - I&#39;m also not reacting well to that. Advice sorely needed!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat might be better for another post - can you lay out some details? When and how does she hit and push? Is she frustrated? Hungry? Need attention? Over enthusiastic and trying to play?<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond the specifics, though, it can make a big big difference in your relationship to actively look for things to love about your girl. Every day, several times a day, make a point of thinking about things that are wonderful and amazing about her. It can take practice, if you&#39;ve slipped into defensive mode, I know! With time and practice, you may well come to see these big feelings as one of the amazing parts of her - she&#39;s a vital, sensitive soul who feels things deeply. If you can see her that way more, her falling apart and saying the wrong things will seem more like a bump in the road than a defect. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"s.waynforth@btinternet.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] &quot;Bad Mommy&quot;","postDate":"1287222763","msgId":44964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1NDk1NC4yMjY5My5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwMy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGk5YWt1bitjbW9kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk5YWt1bitjbW9kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44963,"nextInTopic":44966,"prevInTime":44963,"nextInTime":44965,"topicId":44963,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yelling bad mommy doesn t sound experimental, it sounds like something borne from frustration or tiredness or hunger.
