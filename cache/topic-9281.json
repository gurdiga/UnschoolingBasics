Some of them are happy but there are a lot of<br/>\nthem that aren&#39;t.<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say here, sorry.<br/>\n****We have a friend that is wheel chair bound. We had him over this<br/>\npast weekend and one of the things that came up was that if you love<br/>\nwhat you do, you will never work a day in your life. Doing what you love<br/>\nwill put bread on the table just as quick as doing what you hate will.<br/>\nThe only difference is that you might accidently be happy if you get to<br/>\ndo what you love.<br/>\nIn my experience that&#39;s not necessarily true.  In my experience doing<br/>\nwhat you love offers immediate gratification, often at the expense of<br/>\nlong term satisfaction.  If I could make a living smoking pot and<br/>\nplaying armchair psychoanalyst for various people I encounter online I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t lack for anything.  Except maybe money to pay the bills and buy<br/>\nfood.  In other words, it&#39;s a nice idea, just do what you like and it<br/>\nwill all come together for the good, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that<br/>\nsimple.  At least, I&#39;ve yet to find it work out that conveniently. <br/>\nInstead, I&#39;m trying to analyze what it is about unschooling that works<br/>\nbecause, again in my experience, the effects are more rewarding than<br/>\nconventional school. However, I don&#39;t have the experience with<br/>\nunschooling as I do with conventional education, and I simply cannot<br/>\nabide by well-meaning advice that suggests I just trust someone because<br/>\nthey say so.  I don&#39;t vote that way, I don&#39;t explore spiritual beliefs<br/>\nthat way, I don&#39;t raise my children that way.  I&#39;m curious as to the<br/>\n&quot;mechanics&quot; if you will, of unschooling.  I want to know *how* it &quot;all<br/>\nworks out in the end.&quot;  I want to know what box am I comfortably sitting<br/>\nin that I don&#39;t know about and how can I learn to recognize it so my<br/>\nchildren need not be squished in here with me if they don&#39;t choose. <br/>\nGathering more information is my goal, not judging anyone.<br/>\n  In asking about tv, I&#39;m learning so much more than tv limitations or<br/>\nlack of limitations.  This has been a rewarding exploration for me in<br/>\njust this one question.  My mind is grabbing all kinds of examples of<br/>\nall kinds of events and I&#39;m learning to reinterpret things in a new (and<br/>\nhopefully) more accurate way.  For example, I&#39;m learning to watch my<br/>\nkids&#39; tv habits in hopes of finding out what roll it serves for them. <br/>\nI&#39;m finding they watch it during the day but by the evening, they&#39;ve got<br/>\ntoo many ideas to explore to be cooped up on the couch.  I&#39;m spending my<br/>\ntime thinking about what they watch and what it might offer them, and<br/>\nI&#39;m looking around my area to see if there are any other resources that<br/>\nmight be inspiring and satisfying for them in the same general area of<br/>\ninterest.  I&#39;m learning what my kids&#39; needs are beyond educational<br/>\npreparation for college and I&#39;m learning that I don&#39;t need to give up<br/>\nthe idea of college for the enjoyment of having a nice relationship with<br/>\nthem now.  I&#39;m learning that exploration of ideas leads to seeking out<br/>\nmentors in those fields and this is a natural developmental evolution<br/>\nfor children/young adults.  I&#39;m learning *why* I can let go of the idea<br/>\nthat professional teachers are better equipped to tend to the needs of<br/>\nmy children seeking mentors, not because someone tells me so, but<br/>\nbecause it makes sense when I look at the details.  I recognize my<br/>\nquestions are going to be frustrating to those who have btdt more times<br/>\nthan they care to recall, but at the same time, it&#39;s helpful *for me*<br/>\nand I assume for others reading, as well.  I&#39;ve not btdt.  I appreciate<br/>\nall the insight and concrete idea&#39;s that have been shared with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n****Practical is good but I would like to give my kids the time to enjoy<br/>\nlife and not worry about being practical. I want them to enjoy being a<br/>\nkid.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Connie<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So do I.  However, I will not set them up for failure if I can help it,<br/>\nand I think not having practical skills would be setting them up for<br/>\nfailure.  I&#39;m exploring how unschooling works so I can discover for<br/>\nmyself if indeed they will be denied those practical skills, and I&#39;m<br/>\nfinding evidence to suggest those skills can be met in other ways.  I&#39;m<br/>\nalso finding these skills, when naturally developed, are stronger than<br/>\nwhen taught as from a lesson.  I find that very intriguing and want to<br/>\nlearn more.  I hope that makes sense.<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163621138,"authorName":"odiniella","from":"&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt;","profile":"odiniella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: question about tv","postDate":"1302187752","msgId":46464,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlua2l0OCt2YXBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2NjIyNy45ODk2Ny5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNi5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46463,"nextInTopic":46465,"prevInTime":46463,"nextInTime":46465,"topicId":9281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Pokemon pretty much  <br/>\nshaped her life. :-) She played Pokemon. She collected Pokemon. She  <br/>\ndrew and sculpted Pokemon. She created databases of Pokemon. She  <br/>\ncreated her own Pokemon like creatures and drew comics and other  <br/>\nstories about them.

Try and imagine any other resource that brings <br/>\nthe level of entertainment and engagement and information with seemingly so <br/>\nlittle effort. There is only the internet that I can think of. And that, too, is <br/>\na wonderful thing. However it has been labelled and maligned by lots of folks in <br/>\nlots of ways. And, so, to err on the side of caution parents create boundaries <br/>\nand rules to try and limit access to this amazing and fabulous thing. So what&#39;s <br/>\nwrong with that? Well, I can tell you that one of the things that you fail to do <br/>\nif you limit access to something that your children find enjoyable, interesting, <br/>\nstimulating, engaging is that you don&#39;t trust them to recognise value. And from <br/>\nan unschooling perspective, that&#39;s a pretty big failure. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I thought about addiction. I don&#39;t really buy into the idea of <br/>\naddiction. I know there are substances that have addictive properties, the <br/>\nlonger you ingest them the more you need to maintain the same response, <br/>\nsubstances that cross the blood-brain barrier and change (if only temporarily) <br/>\nthe chemistry of the brain. But, I am a Bruce Alexander <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/)\">http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/)</a> believer. I <br/>\nbelieve that environment is the key factor in addiction and not the substance. <br/>\nWe have lots of things in our home that others might find addictive, but none of <br/>\nus do. We have recently unsubscribed from satellite television because nobody <br/>\nwas watching it and we chose, instead, to put the money into buying series or <br/>\nmovies that we wanted to watch on dvd. And I am not using the word &quot;we&quot; <br/>\nincorrectly. There were discussions and it was unanimous, not with me leading.

It might not make  <br/>\nyou like reading less, but it would certainly make you like reading  <br/>\naround him less, and probably whittle away at your relationship with  <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the thing is, he would be doing it for what he believes are very  <br/>\ngood reasons. He would be wanting the best for you and trying to steer  <br/>\nyou in the right direction. But it wouldn&#39;t feel right or good, would  <br/>\nit?

To me, there is nothing wrong with somebody working all day and coming home and relaxing in the evenings. Some people come home from work and read. Some people get on the computer. Some people garden. Why is there a problem with doing something that you enjoy from after dinner until bedtime? Your parents were obviously able to work and pay the bills. If you are used to living a life doing what other people tell you to do, then when you get a bit of free time, it is only natural to want to relax and focus your energy on something that you enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not surrounded by interesting people but that&#39;s only because I&#39;m not surrounded by many people.

Just because you don&#39;t think those people are interesting doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t interesting. My husband and I recently had a discussion about the small things. A lot of small things in life can be interesting if you take the time to notice them and see them from a different perspective.

Check and see if there is a Chamber of Commerce or visitor&#39;s bureau in your area. They are great sources of things to do locally. I get kind of burned out on the notion that everything has to be big in order for it to count. A family trip to the grocery store can be fun. A family drive through the countryside is always nice. There are tons of things that could be considered boring or mundane that are full of cool and interesting stuff. If your kids like lots of activities, then find them lots of activities. If your kids would rather hang out at home and pursue their interests that way, then give them the time and space to hang out at home. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I was raised to get a degree to have a job.

Some of them are happy but there are a lot of them that aren&#39;t. We have a friend that is wheel chair bound. We had him over this past weekend and one of the things that came up was that if you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life. Doing what you love will put bread on the table just as quick as doing what you hate will. The only difference is that you might accidently be happy if you get to do what you love. Practical is good but I would like to give my kids the time to enjoy life and not worry about being practical.

Hopefully their <br/>\ninterests in these other areas will grow enough that their interest in zoning <br/>\nout in front of the TV will wane all on its own, as they find how much fun it is <br/>\nto engage their bodies and their active, imaginative minds in these other <br/>\nactivities. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\n Would you tell your child he needed to read less because everything needs to be <br/>\ndone in moderation?<br/>\nTV watching can probably wane for Helen&#39;s kids unless she decides to limit them <br/>\nand then  keep going back and forth between trusting them and rationing ( <br/>\nintervening) with their TV watching. I agree that given time and support they <br/>\nwill find things they love to do, after they have been able to deschool, but <br/>\nthey may  love TV and still watch more than Helen is comfortable with. Maybe <br/>\ntheir career will have something to do with TV. Or maybe TV will lead them to <br/>\nsomething they love. Maybe one day while being bored they will be changing <br/>\nchannels and come upon something they decide to try out and that will lead them <br/>\nto a lot of joy and learning.

For your own sanity as much as anything else - you&#39;ll be the one doing all the deschooling (and you will be, even if you start now, things in your child&#39;s life will trigger thoughts and feelings from your past and you&#39;ll be deschooling again, I promise!) so set yourself up to say Yes with an open heart, and then stretch a little and say Yes some more. That&#39;s better for you And for your relationship with your child. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in terms of tv (or sugar, or video games, the other two scaries), start where you&#39;re comfortable, but with the understanding that this is an issue where you&#39;ll eventually be doing some stretching. Read stories of happy, busy unschoolers who happen to use tv as one of the tools in their life to help you relax on the subject. Expect to be a helper, not a barricade. That&#39;s enough to get you started ;) The Good news about tv is that its changing so much right now that there are more choices all the time - its not a case of 700 channels or nothing, and there&#39;s no goal to get to 700 channels. <br/>\n<br/>\nEasing in is still good advice for people coming to unschooling with older kids, by the way. It&#39;s better to say yes more and build up trust than to dump all the rules at once and panic everyone in the family, yourself included - but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way! Some kids catch on to &quot;say yes more&quot; and want to know what&#39;s up. And some kids really do need to have their parents step away from the wall, as it were, and get right out and swim in the deep water so they have time to heal and grow a bit before they&#39;re grown. Older kids need you to stretch as much as you possibly can Right Now!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;their interest in zoning out in front of the TV <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s a place to start easing ;) Question that assumption. It helped me, when I was new to unschooling, to turn assumptions like that on their head and ask &quot;if that&#39;s Not what&#39;s happening, what Else could be going on?&quot; If they aren&#39;t zoning out....? Some people have very flat affect when they are concentrating. Others take in a lot of information in a more relaxed state - zoning &quot;in&quot; if you like. And there&#39;s a looooooot of information in the combination of audio and visual input from a show or movie, lots going on, which means there&#39;s often a lot of learning happening while someone is watching tv - whether watching a sitcom or nature show, cartoon, adventure, history, action flick..... &quot;tv&quot; isn&#39;t a monolithic thing, after all, its a conglomeration of resources especially in this time when &quot;tv&quot; can include movies and internet as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: question about tv","postDate":"1302132875","msgId":46446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGluaXRhYitqbDBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGluaWo1cStiM2hsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46445,"nextInTopic":46447,"prevInTime":46445,"nextInTime":46447,"topicId":9281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ******************* Something that helps a lot with unschooling is starting from the assumption that independence in adulthood is something that s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1941925040\">&quot;odiniella&quot; &lt;hgaimari@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;From the outside, the idea of watching tv all day<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t correspond to the skills needed for independence in adulthood<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that helps a lot with unschooling is starting from the assumption that &quot;independence in adulthood&quot; is something that&#39;s natural for people to want. You don&#39;t have to push the hatchlings out of the nest, when they&#39;re ready, they&#39;ll go! It also helps to keep in mind that real life doesn&#39;t look like school. It&#39;s not a matter of slowly building skills and independence at a dull grind, its more like physical growth where things seem to happen in spurts. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf creativity is an important idea to you, then think of watching tv as soaking up artwork and context. Tv is chock full of audio and visual art and like a lot of art the good stuff is full of context and references to other art. Tv is also a wonderful source of information in and of itself - not always accurate, but neither is any one source. Interest in a particular subject leads to cross-checking sources, anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;giving them the skills they&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; need to do what interests them as adults.

By valuing what they value so that they are empowered to pursue their interests right now. By helping them overcome hurdles between them and what they want so that they get used to the idea that limits and problems are hurdles to be overcome, not brick walls to batter against in vain. And because it&#39;s natural for kids to want more independence and more of a sense of personal competence, over time they&#39;ll take on more of the problem solving and use you more as one of many resources. But it likely won&#39;t be schoolish, steady progress! It will be jumps and rests, big growing periods and times of lying fallow, waiting for spring, with no way to know when spring will come until its here. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: question about tv","postDate":"1302131550","msgId":46445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGluaXMwdStoZGM3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGluaWMyOCthcnNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46444,"nextInTopic":46446,"prevInTime":46444,"nextInTime":46446,"topicId":9281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s not a matter of *either* being responsive *or* being creative - creativity itself depends on inspiration. It can help to think about the way various arts are classically taught - people are encouraged to imitate other artists at first (selected artists, anyway) and use that as a basis for developing skills and ideas. Without directive teaching, though, people do that naturally - they discover &quot;influences&quot; from observing a range of art that has already been produced in the medium of interest. More sophisticated artists spend a lot of time taking in others&#39; works - in the same medium and others. Do you see what I mean? Your input is important, but it isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s important or even the most important thing (which can be a crushing blow to parental egos - are you feeling strong?). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Unschooling, and in particular removing *my*<br/>\n&gt; judgments on things of value, ought to develop a far more creative kind<br/>\n&gt; of adult<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on what you mean by &quot;judgements&quot;. Discernment matters! and it can be a source of valuable information. It&#39;s knee-jerk criticism that you want to avoid. Jumping to &quot;this is stupid&quot; will get in your kids way.

I&#39;m new to unschooling as well -- actually, just exploring it at this point as an alternative for our child-to-be. TV is obviously a hot topic with unschoolers; I&#39;ve been on a few of these discussion boards for about two weeks now, and already this topic has come up three times.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is that even if I let my kids self-direct their education, it&#39;s still my job as a parent to provide guidance. If you&#39;re concerned that your kids are spending too much time in front of the TV, I see nothing wrong with encouraging them to find something else to do, whether it&#39;s read a book, go on a bike ride, start a craft project, load the dishwasher, whatever. If it gets to the point where they&#39;re spending most or all of the day in front of the tube, I&#39;d have no problem rationing their viewing time. I look at TV as a very addictive drug (and scientific studies tend to bear this out, in terms of TV&#39;s physical effect on the brain), and sometimes even grown adults need some amount of &quot;intervention&quot; to get them to hit the off button.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear in mind that I come from a point of view of having little use for TV in the first place. My wife and I were talking about pulling the plug before we even had a child on the way. Our TV goes on maybe two or three times a month, and then it&#39;s almost always to watch a sporting event. It&#39;s just not worth the $90-a-month cable bill. So our decision is practical as much as it is ethical (and I won&#39;t drone on about that here). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you&#39;re a TV family, I really think it just boils down to common sense. Moderation in all things. You need a healthy balance. If you&#39;re worried about the boredom factor, just help your kids find other interests and outlets. It sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job of that already. Hopefully their interests in these other areas will grow enough that their interest in zoning out in front of the TV will wane all on its own, as they find how much fun it is to engage their bodies and their active, imaginative minds in these other activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdrian</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196677035,"authorName":"Tina Tarbutton","from":"Tina Tarbutton &lt;tina.tarbutton@...&gt;","profile":"dravensmomhome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: question about tv","postDate":"1302118093","msgId":46441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGluT2RjZHpSNFZZaW9PPWtpenRNaEJDTjFiNFlRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGluaWMyOCthcnNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGluZzJiTUNQVmZlZ1BVdzZBbzFhb0pFODc4NDlRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8aW5pYzI4K2Fyc29AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":46440,"nextInTopic":46442,"prevInTime":46440,"nextInTime":46442,"topicId":9281,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m on the computer at least 10 minutes<br/>\nout of every waking hour, and frequently spend 2-3 hours at a time in front<br/>\nof it.  To some that&#39;s way too much, if I had a small child it<br/>\nwould certainly be way too much, for me it&#39;s the right amount of time.  My<br/>\npartner spends about 1 hour a day or less on the computer.  Draven spends<br/>\nlots of 5 minute spurts on the computer.  Which one is right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI watch maybe 2 hours of TV per week.  My partner watches 2-3 hours a day or<br/>\nmore, and Draven has the TV or video games on constantly.  Which one is<br/>\nright?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up with very little restriction on TV time, Parker had a moderate<br/>\namount of restriction, but also spent 3 years in another country without<br/>\nmuch access to TV.  My parents watch way more TV than I do.  I don&#39;t think<br/>\nany of that really affected our adult decisions about TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExpecting your children to develop the same values as you in regards to<br/>\nmedia is unreasonable no matter what form of lifestyle you lead (unschooling<br/>\nor traditional parenting) because individual people have different values.<br/>\n Children who are raised in strict households may adhere to their parents<br/>\nvalues until they move out, but then they develop their own values anyway.<br/>\n Unschooled children have the freedom to develop those values in a more<br/>\nnatural way over a longer period of time, without fighting against the<br/>\nimposed authority of their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example that is away from TV.  I&#39;m living with my parents right now.  We<br/>\nmoved in to help out with my stepfather, who had a stroke.  He is a very<br/>\nstrict, negative man and while he says very little about our lifestyle, and<br/>\nhas finally stopped trying to correct Draven for every little thing, it&#39;s<br/>\nstill hard living with him.  He and my mom are leaving this evening for an<br/>\nextended RV trip.  We probably won&#39;t change anything about the way we live<br/>\nonce they&#39;re gone, however we&#39;re looking forward to living without being<br/>\njudged for our every move.  We&#39;re also planning on being in our own place<br/>\nagain by the time that they get back, now that our help is no longer needed.<br/>\n Financially there is a huge benefit to living here, and my mother loves<br/>\nhaving us here, but living with my stepfather&#39;s constant, silent, negative,<br/>\njudgement looming over us is too much to bear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing to me, with unschooling, is that Draven never feel<br/>\nlike that towards us.  I want him always to feel welcome in our home,<br/>\nwithout judgement, without negativity, no matter how old or young he is.<br/>\n That&#39;s not saying I don&#39;t want him to eventually have his own home and his<br/>\nown life separate from me, but I don&#39;t want him longing for that life the<br/>\ncloser he gets to 18.  I want our home to always be his home too, instead of<br/>\nsome place he feels stuck until he hits some magical age, or until he saves<br/>\nup enough money or until whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t unschool so he develops my value system, I don&#39;t unschool so he<br/>\ncontrols his own TV use.

He&#39;s either<br/>\nplaying on Xbox live, or watching YouTube videos about any number of things<br/>\nor watching TV while playing with something else.  Sometimes more than one<br/>\nof those things are happening at the same time (he&#39;s often watching YouTube<br/>\nwhile watching TV).  He also falls asleep while watching TV and only<br/>\nsometimes remembers to set the sleep timer.  Since he goes to bed long after<br/>\nme, I typically turn it off when I wake up if he seems to be sleeping<br/>\nsoundly (otherwise the silence wakes him up).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis developed over time though, we&#39;re about two years into unschooling at<br/>\nthis point, maybe less.  At first when we lifted TV restriction there was<br/>\nlots of what I thought was boredom TV watching, but really it was him trying<br/>\nto get in as much as he could before I replaced the restrictions.  There<br/>\nwere many hours of very passive &quot;couch potato&quot; type behavior.  Now that he&#39;s<br/>\npretty comfortable with the idea that I won&#39;t restrict it anymore, he&#39;s more<br/>\ncomfortable using it as background noise, or as something to get ideas from<br/>\nto further his imaginative play.  When TV is playing he&#39;s normally standing<br/>\nup in front of his bed setting up some huge battle scene with halo figures.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I would have constantly tried to redirect his attention away from that<br/>\npassive watching, I think he would have gotten the impression that I was<br/>\nstill judging his TV time and TV use, and he wouldn&#39;t have had the<br/>\nopportunity to develop his own relationship with that particular medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids were instead sitting on the couch passively reading when they<br/>\nwere bored, would you have the same reaction?  Treat TV the same way you<br/>\ntreat anything else, it&#39;s just one of many options that they have in the<br/>\nday, provide an exciting environment for them to choose from and then don&#39;t<br/>\njudge their choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I found some cork board and magnetic dry erase board squares on<br/>\nclearance at Walmart.  I also found some neat looking notebooks and pencils,<br/>\nalso on clearance.  We put up the boards in his room and played with the<br/>\nmagnets and push pins for awhile.  When I went to bed he was playing with<br/>\naction figures and watching TV.  This morning when I checked on him he had<br/>\nmany drawings and things he&#39;d written up on the cork boards and some designs<br/>\non the dry erase boards.  I&#39;m pretty sure these things happened with the TV<br/>\non in the background (it was still on this morning).  I provided something I<br/>\nthought he&#39;d be interested in, and helped him hang it up, but then I left<br/>\nit, he chose how to use it and when.  I feel the same way about TV, I<br/>\nprovide the TV and the cable, he chooses how to use it and when.  If I try<br/>\nto direct his use of the things I provide he won&#39;t have the chance to<br/>\ndevelop his own relationship with those things.
