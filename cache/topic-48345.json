In<br/>\ndoing so, a memory came up for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was about 9 years old, broke, and ate beans & rice every night.  I was<br/>\nso tired of eating beans & rice and told my Mom so.  She told me to get<br/>\nover it, eat it, or go to bed hungry.  So, I went to my room, stomach<br/>\nrambling and became so, so angry.  I started throwing my records on the<br/>\nfloor, breaking them.  Anything to get her attention and more<br/>\nimportantly, understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI allowed myself the moments to breathe that memory in and out.  I tell<br/>\nmyself that today I have a choice.  Today, as Mom in this scenario, I<br/>\nwould have taken me aside and listened to my complaints about the food<br/>\nand deeper issues that the food manifested.  I would ask if anything in<br/>\nthe kitchen we could find to make that would give me something different<br/>\nto eat.  I would ask about item I could purchase that would give me a<br/>\nfeeling of being satisfied with my nourishment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAHH..felt better already.  And so, giving my son these loving<br/>\nexperiences IS giving them to myself.

The parent needs to &quot;get it out&quot; and can keep me on the phone for hours. &lt;g&gt; It may take weeks or months or years to get over the trauma, but slowly the parent can heal and start seeing the *benefits* of home/unschooling instead of the anger at school.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s part of the healing process.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWork it out yourself.
