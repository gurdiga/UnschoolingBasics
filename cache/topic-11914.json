I remember living and learning with a pair of one year <br/>\nolds, a 9 year old, and a 15 year old. Lots of conflicting needs and very little <br/>\nconvergence of desires!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my twins were toddlers, we time shifted what we could. When my husband <br/>\ngot home from work I&#39;d take the older kids to the library or whatever <br/>\nbusinesses they wanted to go to. We also did way more things on the weekends than I&#39;d <br/>\nhave wished, not enjoying the weekend crowds. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n**We live in a rural area and by the time we drive where he wants to go and<br/>\n<br/>\nbrowse around for a bit, it&#39;s time for James&#39; nap (he still takes 2<br/>\n<br/>\n2-hr naps a day). And when we sacrifice the nap to do fun stuff, James<br/>\n<br/>\nis miserable for the evening.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s really tough. Will he sleep in the car? Any chance of napping in a <br/>\nstroller? If you&#39;re not already slinging him it might be hard to start, but it <br/>\nwould be worth trying - I know quite a few toddlers who nap well in a sling. If <br/>\nhe&#39;ll sleep in the car, any chance of hiring an older homeschooler to sit with <br/>\nhim while he sleeps while you browse with Connor? That way he could be safe <br/>\nnapping in the car and if he woke you&#39;d be available. Any friends in town you <br/>\ncould visit for nap time, and if so would the little one settle down there into <br/>\na nap?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":203677783,"authorName":"trektheory","from":"&quot;trektheory&quot; &lt;trektheory@...&gt;","profile":"trektheory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: unschooling with children with a large age gap","postDate":"1145061526","msgId":11933,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxcGZhbSt0NDF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDA0MTQyMDA2MjMzNC4xMTkwMS40NDQwMzE5QTAwMDNEQ0ExMDAwMDJFN0QyMjA3MzAwMDMzMEUwMzAzMDEwMzAyMEE5NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":11932,"nextInTopic":12073,"prevInTime":11932,"nextInTime":11934,"topicId":11914,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
