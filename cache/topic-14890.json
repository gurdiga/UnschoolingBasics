I loved your story about learning each other.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been taking in foster kids in MA for about 5 years. The decisions about <br/>\nschool ultimately fall to the parent, or pre-adoptive parent, you.   If the <br/>\nstate is placing Jackie with you then you have met their parenting criteria as <br/>\nan adoptive home and you will receive paperwork that gives you the authority <br/>\nto make educational decisions on her behalf.  There are many reasons one might <br/>\nchoose not to send a child to K that have nothing to do with freedom or <br/>\nunschooling.  Things that social workers will understand.  Like that Jackie will be <br/>\ntransitioning to her new life and she&#39;ll need to be with her family during <br/>\nthis time with as little interruption as possible.  If the social workers give <br/>\nyou any grief about K,  I&#39;m sure you can find a doctor, therapist, psychiatrist <br/>\nor other clinical expert (any friends in the business?) who can advocate for <br/>\nJackie and help you show them (DSS) that it is in her best interest to keep her <br/>\nout of Kindergarten until after the adoption, when you can do what you want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoy to all of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nRobin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":244360311,"authorName":"Deb","from":"&quot;Deb&quot; &lt;soggyboysmom@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Our Last Few weeks","postDate":"1151351446","msgId":14945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3cGRxbStvdmM2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzNy4xNGNmMjhiLjMxZDE4NjdkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14944,"nextInTopic":14979,"prevInTime":14944,"nextInTime":14946,"topicId":14890,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She is going to need us <br/>\nto make a lot of decisions for her to help her feel safe and cared <br/>\nfor. &quot;Academic&quot; unschooling should be easy -- she&#39;s only 5 and she <br/>\nlikes to play and explore and that&#39;s all natural for her. &quot;Life&quot; <br/>\nunschooling is probably going to take a couple years or more of <br/>\ngradually ...I don&#39;t know ...de-hard-lifing? NOT giving her more <br/>\nfreedom from the start may be a challenge for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she is very nice, funny, and cute. We are really excited.<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14976,"nextTopicId":14969}}
