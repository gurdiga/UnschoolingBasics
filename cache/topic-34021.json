I didn&#39;t realize all of this discussion on diet and TV was<br/>\nin the RU category, though it makes sense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRemoving the school paradigm makes a huge amount of sense to me.  I<br/>\nteach at large public university and must spend a significant amount<br/>\nof time getting my students to understand how to take the initiative<br/>\nin their own education and to learn how to learn.  The major<br/>\nimpediment to student success at my university is - a complete<br/>\ninability to manage one&#39;s time - because students have never been<br/>\nresponsible for their own time before.  Unschooling, in my mind, would<br/>\navoid this &quot;learned helplessness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the parenting discussion has been really interesting as I have<br/>\nnever really seen this type of parenting, but am already changing some<br/>\nof my approach and the resulting payoff in an improved relationsihp<br/>\nwith my son has been amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the clarification,<br/>\nKerry<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Debra Rossing&quot;<br/>\n&lt;debra.rossing@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; The simplest answer is that unschooling is removing the school paradigm<br/>\n&gt; educationally - trusting that children will learn to read, add, etc. as<br/>\n&gt; they need to in their own time and their own ways. &quot;Radical&quot;<br/>\n&gt; unschooling, aka whole life unschooling among other alternate<br/>\n&gt; appellations, is extending that trust to the rest of life - sleep, food,<br/>\n&gt; hygiene, clothing, media (TV, computers, videogames, and such like<br/>\n&gt; that), etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"Debra Rossing","from":"&quot;Debra Rossing&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:newbie question about RU","postDate":"1214401891","msgId":34047,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2Q0U5M0ZFMjRGMTcwNEM4QkIyOEQ1RkM5MTNENEQ1NEFEOTMwQEJPWC5DTkNTT0ZUV0FSRS5DT00+"},"prevInTopic":34021,"nextInTopic":34065,"prevInTime":34046,"nextInTime":34048,"topicId":34021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The simplest answer is that unschooling is removing the school paradigm educationally - trusting that children will learn to read, add, etc. as they need to in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-877183974\">The simplest answer is that unschooling is removing the school paradigm<br/>\neducationally - trusting that children will learn to read, add, etc. as<br/>\nthey need to in their own time and their own ways. &quot;Radical&quot;<br/>\nunschooling, aka whole life unschooling among other alternate<br/>\nappellations, is extending that trust to the rest of life - sleep, food,<br/>\nhygiene, clothing, media (TV, computers, videogames, and such like<br/>\nthat), etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.
