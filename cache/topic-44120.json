I am using  <br/>\nit to find every possible opportunity to build my relationship with my  <br/>\nson.  It&#39;s been fascinating.  I&#39;m learning about him and my daughter  <br/>\nbut even more about myself, and my amazing ability to make  &quot;yes&quot;   <br/>\nsound negative.   (i.e.  Yes, but only if......     Yes, but be  <br/>\ncareful to.........  Yes, but I expect.........  etc. etc.)  I think  <br/>\nin  my own childhood I internalized a bit of guilt about feeling joy  <br/>\nor pleasure for following one&#39;s heart (after all, joy and pleasure are  <br/>\nsupposed to result from hard work, doing a good job, mastering  <br/>\nimpulses and serving others; indulging yourself is....... well,  <br/>\nindulgent!)  and attaching downers to everything has been my sort of  <br/>\npsychic compromise between what I carry around subconsciously and what  <br/>\nmakes sense to me now.  Now that I see that, of course, I&#39;m dropping  <br/>\nit, and making sure my kids know that when I say  Yes  it&#39;s not coming  <br/>\nwith a grudge but with love and joy and total support.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat helps some -- there&#39;s been a lot of joy and generosity around  <br/>\nhere recently, since these things are contagious!!  Even so, though,  <br/>\nthere are times when my son&#39;s desires simply can&#39;t be met, and until  <br/>\nhe trusts that I really and truly want to do all I can to facilitate  <br/>\nhim getting what he wants, these unavoidable  &quot;no&#39;s&quot;  are likely to  <br/>\nset him off on one of his horrible tantrums.  (This is my theory right  <br/>\nnow, at least -- that once he can get past the conviction that the  <br/>\nwhole world is out to get him, he&#39;ll be able to handle the times when  <br/>\nhe is let down better.)  So for the past several days I&#39;ve been  <br/>\nrepeating to myself,  &quot;it&#39;s about the relationship&quot;  almost like a  <br/>\nmantra, in hopes that when tempers flare I can focus my response on  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s broken or breaking in the relationship and attempt to set that  <br/>\nright, rather than trying to fix the situation that seems to have  <br/>\ntriggered the anger.  I&#39;ve had a couple opportunities to practice this  <br/>\napproach in the last couple days, and am encouraged that even my  <br/>\nclumsy attempts seem to help some.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks again for all the suggestions.  I really, really  <br/>\nappreciate the support!<br/>\n<br/>\nstephanie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44031,"nextTopicId":44128}}
