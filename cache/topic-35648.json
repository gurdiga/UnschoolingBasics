If I&#39;m being unreasonable (from their  <br/>\npoint of view), then they&#39;re saying/thinking silently - &quot;She&#39;s so  <br/>\nunfair,&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s not listening,&quot; or &quot;She doesn&#39;t even care about  <br/>\nME,&quot; or &quot;She cares about them more than about me,&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s pushing  <br/>\nme around just because she&#39;s a grown-up,&quot; or even, worst case, &quot;I HATE  <br/>\nher!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nParents seem to think they can control children&#39;s thoughts. When they  <br/>\nsnap at them to stop splashing, they think the kid is thinking, &quot;Oh -  <br/>\nMom&#39;s right - I should stop splashing people walking by, that&#39;s not  <br/>\nthoughtful of me to do that.&quot; But, most likely, they&#39;re thinking, &quot;She  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want me to have any fun.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid is already mature enough/developed enough to care to be  <br/>\nthoughtful of others in that situation, then they&#39;ll appreciate a  <br/>\nreminder that other people are walking by. That means just saying,  <br/>\n&quot;Oh, there are people getting splashed,&quot; or even just a nod in the  <br/>\npeople&#39;s direction is enough because THEN the kid will think, &quot;Whoops,  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t want to get splashed,&quot; and will change their own behavior  <br/>\nof their own choice because of their OWN thoughtfulness. Sometimes  <br/>\nthey might even have the fleeting thought - &quot;Glad mom noticed and  <br/>\ninformed me.&quot; (Not in those words, but the sense of that idea, anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid isn&#39;t mature enough/developed enough to be thoughtful and  <br/>\ncaring in that kind of situation, yet, then parents telling them to be  <br/>\nthoughtful won&#39;t make them so. Parents who don&#39;t want to flat-out  <br/>\ncontrol kids through the blunt-force methods (spanking, yelling,  <br/>\nnagging, time-outs, take-aways, shaming, threatening) have to be  <br/>\nprepared with other alternatives to control-methods - many of those  <br/>\nways involve planning ahead and setting the stage for successful happy  <br/>\noutcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see, over and over, parents setting the stage for conflict. Going to  <br/>\nthat fountain in the first place was probably an example of setting  <br/>\nthe stage for conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I was in the mall, sitting at a table sipping coffee, waiting  <br/>\nfor my girls who were shopping. I watched a parent with a couple of  <br/>\nyoung children, as she ran into a friend. They stopped RIGHT at the  <br/>\nbottom of the escalator and started to chat. She ignored her two  <br/>\nlittle boys - about 3 and 5ish. Pretty soon they were playing at the  <br/>\nfoot of the escalator, then stepping up onto it and trying to go up  <br/>\n(it was coming down). She was oblivious, talking to her friend. For a  <br/>\nfew minutes there were no people coming down. The boys were running up  <br/>\nit, getting better and better at it. It was a little dangerous because  <br/>\nthe younger boy was really not steady and the older one kept bumping  <br/>\nhim - I was having the urge to go stand right there to soften his  <br/>\nfall, if he went down a few steps. But then there were people coming  <br/>\ndown. The first ones had to squeeze around the boys. Mom didn&#39;t  <br/>\nnotice. The second group had shopping bags and couldn&#39;t get easily  <br/>\npast the boys - one of them sharply said, &quot;This is for going DOWN, not  <br/>\nUP!&quot; That got mom&#39;s embarrassed attention and she turned around and  <br/>\ngrabbed the little one and yanked him out of the way and sharply said  <br/>\nto the older one, &quot;You KNOW better than that. Get over here and stand  <br/>\nright next to me and don&#39;t move.&quot; Turned back to her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a very very normal everyday interaction that would not be  <br/>\nconsidered harsh at all, by most parents. Sit in a busy mall and you  <br/>\ncan see an equivalent scenario played out every few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that the mom set the stage for the problem to occur - it  <br/>\nwas ENTIRELY her doing. I could see it coming the minute she stopped  <br/>\nthere to talk to her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternative - &quot;Hi. Oh it IS good to see you. Give me a call so we can  <br/>\ntalk sometime, I&#39;d love to hear from you.&quot; Move on. Or, &quot;It is SO  <br/>\ngreat to see you. Here - let&#39;s move over here in front of the pet  <br/>\nstore so the boys can look at the puppies while we talk for a minute.&quot;  <br/>\nOr maybe you buy them a frozen yogurt or a pretzel or something. OR  <br/>\nyou sit at a table (remember, I was sitting nearby at a coffee place  <br/>\nwith tables) and pull out the games/toys/etc that you keep in your bag  <br/>\nJUST for this kind of purpose. And, you say to the boys, &quot;This is my  <br/>\nfriend Jane - I haven&#39;t seen her for a while and would really like to  <br/>\ntalk to her for a few minutes, if that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBe prepared - think ahead - treat the children with the utmost  <br/>\ncourtesy - where do you think they&#39;ll learn it, otherwise?<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":87710633,"authorName":"juillet727","from":"&quot;juillet727&quot; &lt;juillet727@...&gt;","profile":"juillet727","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Still to many &quot;no&quot;s","postDate":"1220369721","msgId":35660,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc5am1mcCttYXFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGc5amZjMSthdjEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35659,"nextInTopic":35661,"prevInTime":35659,"nextInTime":35661,"topicId":35648,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"That s one of my re-framing tools.

I have to work on this daily.  I know <br/>\nwhat I went through as a child and I think once in a while I feel resentful that my children <br/>\nhave it soooo good.  Not of my children personally, but I think some of you understand?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just keep putting one foot in front of the the other as my kids continue to be the dear, <br/>\nsweet, loving souls they are...and continue to remind myself that they are just kids still <br/>\nlearning and so am I.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Labor Day we went to the community park to picnic and have fun.  There were kittens <br/>\n(maybe 4-6 months old, so not too kitteny) that had been dumped off there sometime <br/>\nbetween Monday of last week when we had been there and yesterday.  There is just <br/>\nsomething about an animal or person in need that we are completely unable to avoid.  <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  So now we have 4 cats instead of two.  My eldest son found the first one.  He had <br/>\nbeen praying for another pet (his dog died of rat poisioning this past Feb and we are still <br/>\nbroken up about it as we don&#39;t have anything like that here in our home....) and this kitty <br/>\nwalked right up to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second kitty my other son found.  He has such a dear sweet heart and when the kitty <br/>\nwanted to get down, he did so...but she ran away and he couldn&#39;t find her again.  I was <br/>\nable to let him stay at the picnic area with some friends of ours to continue to look for the <br/>\nkitty. The young woman who he stayed with is from Russia and she wanted me to know <br/>\nhow sweet my son was for caring for one of God&#39;s creatures in such a way.  A creature he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t &quot;know&quot;.  That she was excited that I would &quot;let&quot; my son continue to look even <br/>\nthough there was a strong chance that the kitty was gone.  She thanked me for seeing <br/>\nwhat my son needed and not saying &quot;no&quot; or dragging him home.  All I could think of was <br/>\nwhat parent would do that....but she also made me realize that we made the right decision <br/>\nfor us to unschool.  He eventually went back and sat in the area where he found Kara the <br/>\nkitty originally and she came to him.  How many people would see this child as weak for <br/>\nstanding up for the &quot;little guy&quot; or being a protector of the weak?  How many would see his <br/>\ntears and believe we didn&#39;t toughen him up enough? How many would have taken this <br/>\nalmost 10 year old and told him to &quot;straighten up&quot; or &quot;quit being a baby&quot; or &quot;stop your <br/>\nblabbering&quot; or said the cat was just a stupid animal and would find a way to survive.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like to think about how many.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very thankful for this list and having found you all.  Your words of wisdom have been <br/>\ninsightful and helpful!

That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll like getting splashed because the splasher was <br/>\nonly six.  It you don&#39;t want to be splashed it doesn&#39;t matter who <br/>\ndoes the splashing.  It feels wrong and bad.   But generally, people <br/>\nare going to understand about a little kid.  <br/>\n <br/>\nNot so about a fourteen year old or a sixteen year old.   So I&#39;m not <br/>\nat all advocating that this or any mom should relax and ignore her <br/>\nkids while they splash folks who are not participating in the water <br/>\nplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur kids will be living on this planet their whole lives and we <br/>\nshould be helping them learn the things that will make living here <br/>\nbetter and easier for them.    Consideration for others is important <br/>\non a planet with six billion people.  It&#39;s not cool to let our kids <br/>\ninfringe on the rights of others.   <br/>\n <br/>\nThe original poster felt out of control and overwhelmed and even <br/>\ncried.  That seemed to me to be more about what others would think of <br/>\nher parenting than about the actual splashing.   Our fear of what <br/>\nothers will think of us can lead us to make some crappy choices about <br/>\nhow we treat our kids.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen Dylan was younger, and our ideas were new to people, (and new to <br/>\nus!) no one agreed with us.

I still have one neighbor who talks about our family... <br/>\nnot to me, but to the people in her art club and at her church and I <br/>\nhear about it because I know other people from her art club and <br/>\nchurch.&lt;g&gt;   Of all the people on her street that she might talk <br/>\nabout, (and we have some interesting folks here!)  she talks about <br/>\nus.  But we must seem very warped to her, she&#39;s a former teacher, she <br/>\nruns the adult literacy program here in town and she does tutoring <br/>\nand helps people get ready for tests like the GED.   She&#39;d call me <br/>\nsometimes to tell me Dylan was playing outside (as if I might not <br/>\nhave noticed) and, &quot;shouldn&#39;t he be doing his school work?&quot;&lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n <br/>\nNo one ever called CPS or organized an intervention and few bothered <br/>\nto talk in any meaningful way *to us* about what they thought was <br/>\nwrong.   Part of that must have been because of Dylan.  There he was, <br/>\nobviously happy, a nice kid, undeniably smart.   So they had some <br/>\nvague fears but no evidence, and they snorted and huffed but they <br/>\ndidn&#39;t *hurt* us.   And that&#39;s how it will be for most of the rest of <br/>\nyou, too.   The more confident you are in your choices the more you <br/>\nwill inspire others to leave you alone. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nIt helps if you accept that other people have a right to their wrong <br/>\nopinions.&lt;g&gt;   <br/>\n <br/>\nI very much feel entitled to think what I think about my neighbor AND <br/>\nher kids and grand kids.&lt;g&gt;     <br/>\n <br/>\nIf I had cared what all those people thought of my parenting I might <br/>\nhave been a mom who spanked and used time out.  I might have enforced <br/>\nTV limits and bedtimes and food rules.  I might have sent my kid to <br/>\nschool.   Because that&#39;s what parents do here .  That&#39;s how it is.   <br/>\nMy way&#39;s better.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nIf we&#39;re going to do what&#39;s best for our kids then we have to be <br/>\nlooking at our kids.  Not all around at the neighbors and strangers <br/>\nand in-laws but right at our kids. In fifteen years it won&#39;t matter <br/>\nwhat a stranger thought of  you one hot summer afternoon but it will <br/>\nmatter what your kids think of you.  And what they will think of you <br/>\nin fifteen years will be made up of all the little moments between <br/>\nnow and then.   <br/>\n <br/>\n Deb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":66450781,"authorName":"Lisa Russell","from":"Lisa Russell &lt;lisalisarussell@...&gt;","profile":"lisalisarussell","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Still to many &quot;no&quot;s","postDate":"1220321405","msgId":35653,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5NTk5LjUwNDI1LnFtQHdlYjM3OTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35651,"nextInTopic":35656,"prevInTime":35652,"nextInTime":35654,"topicId":35648,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"that is so good, it should be printed on a card & handed out to the parents of kids freaking out in the grocery store http://www.lisarussell.org   because .com","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-573613554\">that is so good, it should be printed on a card & handed out to the parents of kids freaking out in the grocery store<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lisarussell.org\">http://www.lisarussell.org</a>   because .com and .net were taken<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Jodi Bezzola &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jodibezzola@...\">jodibezzola@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Monday, September 1, 2008 6:36:52 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Still to many &quot;no&quot;s<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~~What those strangers think about you as a parent isn&#39;t nearly as important as what your kids think about you.~~<br/>\n <br/>\nI just thought I&#39;d repeat my favourite line from your kick-ass response, thanks Deb.

Give yourself something else to do instead of nagging and shouting.   In that moment when you&#39;re about to say something to your kids in frustration - pause -  breathe, and make a better choice.   You&#39;ll yell a few more times before you remember to take a moment before you speak but it will come to you to pause a moment before you speak and choose better words and a better tone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe belittling maybe a leftover thing from your own childhood and you can stop that too.  If it&#39;s in your mind or on your tongue to say something harsh just don&#39;t speak at all.   And then, in your head, turn it into something else.  If you were about to say &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, why can&#39;t you listen?&quot;  In your head, instead, turn that into, &quot;He&#39;s so busy and engrossed, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s feeling so happy right now.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to force the door against its hinges***<br/>\n<br/>\nDistract them away.  Someone once wrote, &quot;delight&quot; them away.  Offer up something better and more interesting than the door.  That shouldn&#39;t be too hard.  Don&#39;t explain to them again about the hinges.  They&#39;re too little to care about hinges.  Just move them on to something fun and happy.  And get used to the idea that houses require maintenance and repairs for these very reasons.  Humans can be hard on houses. &lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s reality.  Hinges are not more important than these little boys.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*** not to wave the broom above their heads indoors***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe put away your fragile things for now.  Think realistically about whether that broom is really going to hurt anything.   Is the broom a sword?  A club?   Get or make swords or clubs they can wave around. <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to touch the walls with paint on their hands***<br/>\n<br/>\nWalls can be washed and or repainted.   But you can set up a painting place that&#39;s more convenient to them, more convenient for clean up, and you can stay close by to help them and intercept.   If they&#39;re liking the idea of putting their hand prints on things give them an old sheet or bedspread and let them put their hand prints there.  Hang it on the wall as art.  Let them print the sidewalk in front of your house. <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to slosh gallons of water out of the tub***<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are going to slosh.  I think some of your problem is that you have unrealistic expectations.   Kid&#39;s will slosh.  Tell yourself that.  Put a bunch of towels on the floor and reconcile yourself to that reality.  Get them a little pool for water play outside, too.  Reprogram your brain.  Water good.  Grouchy mom, bad. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to open the oven door***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy not?  If they just want to see what&#39;s in there, and it has a glass door, leave the light on so they can peek in the window.  Are you afraid they&#39;ll get hurt?  Not sure I understand the oven door issue.  Are they climbing on it, sitting on it?  Put a stool or two in the kitchen for them to use for climbing and sitting instead. <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to leave the fridge door open***<br/>\n<br/>\nJust close the door when you find it open.  They&#39;re too little to consistently remember that.  Did you grow up with parents who didn&#39;t want you standing there with the fridge door open while you decided what you wanted?   I did.  My folks were depression era people .  They had ice boxes and their parents hounded them about keeping the icebox door closed.  That&#39;s because they had to walk for more ice or wait for the delivery guy to come  and if the ice was gone before they could get more they were buggered.   We don&#39;t have ice boxes.  Our food will not spoil if little boys forget to close the door.   Think about why these things are bugging you and use some logic.   *You* close the door and get over the idea that it&#39;s a crime for it to be left open.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n***not to hit***<br/>\n<br/>\nBe with them more so you can step in before it gets to the hitting point.   They&#39;re both too little to have mastered self control.  *You* haven&#39;t even mastered it if you&#39;re yelling, so expecting little kids to have perfect control over big emotions is an unrealistic expectation.  They will hit unless you&#39;re there to intervene, redirect, distract.  As they get older they&#39;ll be better able to find  other solutions to problems, especially if you are a consistent good example of peaceful problem solving. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I explain why these things are important but I&#39;m being ignored and<br/>\nsneered at. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnored maybe and that&#39;s an indication that you&#39;re nagging.  Every smart person will tune out a nag, so take comfort in the knowledge your kids are smart. &lt;g&gt;   But they&#39;re really not sneering at you.  They have no malice.  That feeling that you&#39;re being sneered at is from someplace inside of you from times past and it&#39;s not fair for you to pin the responsibility for that on your kids.  They love you and they would love for you to be as happy as they are.  Really.<br/>\n<br/>\n***The other day we were out and my children were playing in<br/>\nthe fountain (not disallowed by the town). DS1 (6) was deliberately<br/>\nsplashing passers by.***<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes when I&#39;m watering trees in my front yard and someone walks by I have a powerful urge to spray them with the hose.  Last weekend when I was watering my garden my dh came to the kitchen screen door and was teasing me.  He got blasted.  I&#39;m forty five. &lt;g&gt;   There&#39;s just something nearly irresistable about surprising people with water.  If you&#39;re a water splashing person then six is too little to have good control over that impulse.   <br/>\n<br/>\nTake them to the fountain when there are fewer people about.  Stay near them to either redirect them or warn unsuspecting passersby away.  Take them other places for water play.  Set up a pool in the yard.  Get him a super soaker gun and ask him to water the garden.   Turn him loose in the yard with the hose. <br/>\n<br/>\n***When I approached the fountain and called his<br/>\nname to come and talk to me he ran away laughing. I felt so out of<br/>\ncontrol and helpless I just wept. Later when I talked about it with<br/>\nhim he told me he ran away because he knew I was just going to tell<br/>\nhim off.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry.  It feels terrible to feel that forlorn and overwhelmed.  But people getting splashed with water by a happy kid is not the worst thing that can happen.  When he&#39;s grown up it will be one of the funny and delightful stories you tell about him.   What those strangers think about you as a parent isn&#39;t nearly as important as what your kids think about you.   Try to avoid situations where he can splash other folks, *definitely* because that&#39;s not cool, but don&#39;t make this bigger than it is.    <br/>\n<br/>\n*** Instead of cooking three<br/>\nmeals a day I am always preparing snacks and different meals for<br/>\neveryone. Instead of having time to recharge in the evening, the<br/>\nchildren are still up beyond my saturation point.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s better for your kids than sit down meals.  Be glad you can give them what they want and need.  Lots of moms in the world can&#39;t feed their kids.   Make sit down meals for you and your husband if that feels good to you.   Sometimes (maybe) your kids will come join you, but expect them to like grazing and snacking more right now.  Change your expectation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I realise as I&#39;m writing this that I am feeling resentful - I am<br/>\ndoing everything I can, feeling overwhelmed, and it&#39;s not enough - it<br/>\nfeels like I can never satisfy them.***<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you&#39;re feeling better today.   It takes a lot of energy to be a mom.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it&#39;s not fair or realistic to think of your kids as energy suckers.   They are kids and they need a lot of attention and food and help and support for their play and activates but there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  That is the way of kids.  Stop thinking of them as demanding of you and start thinking of them as your partners on a really fun (unpredictable, wacky) expedition.&lt;g&gt;    <br/>\n<br/>\n***And however much I am trying to<br/>\nrespect their own autonomy they do not respect (OK - obey) the things<br/>\nI do ask.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are *so* little.  So little.  And if you&#39;re making everything feel like a struggle or a fight they are going to struggle and fight with you.  That&#39;s human nature.  If *you* stop fighting and struggling with them you&#39;ll see things change.  Don&#39;t ask more of them than they can do.  If *you* can&#39;t stay patient and calm and happy, if you can&#39;t cope well  then you can&#39;t expect it from them.   You are the barometer.  Your pressure, what you&#39;re feeling inside and what you&#39;re putting on them, is the thing they have to react to.  If you give them a more calm and positive mom you&#39;ll see their reactions, over time, become more calm and positive too. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe secret is not to get them to be more obedient, calmer kids.  The secret is to make yourself more calm and positive and flexible and mindful.  You can never control another person for very long.  You can only control your self, your choices, your reactions, your attitude.   <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am finding it very hard to justify to others (eg my mother) my move<br/>\ntowards unschooling because it does not seem to be making my family<br/>\nany happier.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a hard thing to justify to others even when your family is happy.&lt;g&gt;   Even if your life was as perfect right now as you wish for there would be people telling you how wrong, misguided, irresponsible, negligent and just plain stupid you are.  You can decide to get used to it.&lt;g&gt;    Focus on what your kids think of you instead.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***I&#39;m  worried that we are just not creative enough, or energetic enough or<br/>\ngood enough to offer our children this lifestyle.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does take energy and creativity.  Come here or to other lists more often with specific questions.  After a few weeks or months of reading suggestions you will start thinking of more creative solutions on your own, but we&#39;re always here.    <br/>\n<br/>\n***I can hear the negativity in my voice, and I am so churned up to have<br/>\nto admit this, but I feel far from living joyfully.***<br/>\n<br/>\nChange is hard.  It&#39;s hard to change ourselves and our thinking but you&#39;re on a list full of people who&#39;ve done just that and we can give you ideas and suggestions whenever you need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Where am I going wrong?***<br/>\n<br/>\nSpend more time thinking about what&#39;s right.   You have two happy kids.  You have husband who&#39;s on board with unschooling.  You have a fountain to play in! (How cool is that?!)  You have a couple thousand people at your service here on this list. &lt;g&gt;  You have access to lots of unschooling websites and books.   You have permission to let that darn refrigerator door stand open. &lt;g&gt;  You can let go of ideas and conditioning that are not useful (and probably never were.)   <br/>\n<br/>\nGo stand in front of a full length mirror and see what your kids see.  Smile.  Relax.  Adopt some really positive self talk.  Think about what&#39;s playing in your head and switch off the negative stuff.  Choose to be positive.  Choose to think of yourself as a mom getting better at her job every moment.  Choose to think of your kids as just right.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you think of all the things that seem wrong you will get overwhelmed.  It will feel impossible to change.    Think of the moment.  What can you do this moment to make a little more peace in your house.  What can you say to your kids to add a little more joy to their play.   What can you think about to feel a little more positive right now?    Take it moment by moment and in each moment make a positive choice. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\nmom to Dylan, 16, always unschooled<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35668,"nextTopicId":35654}}
