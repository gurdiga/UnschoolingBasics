And I know<br/>\nthat for me, I give so much because I care of course, often deferring my own<br/>\ndesires and needs, so that when I have something that feels really<br/>\nimportant - like the bathroom situation you described for you - that is<br/>\nabout my needs, I often feel quite frustrated that my kids seem unable to<br/>\njust &quot;get it&quot; that yes I do need this!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found out through trial and error that my kids can&#39;t tune in like<br/>\nanother adult to sense my needs, much as I&#39;d like them to, but that if I<br/>\ntalk to them and make the needs clear in a way they can understand then<br/>\ntheir ability to care about my needs and respond to them is amazing.  So if<br/>\nI had the stress of your bathroom situation and I wanted to get rid of that<br/>\nstress but get my privacy, I&#39;d find a time when I was feeling better to talk<br/>\nto my daughter about the situation - I&#39;d let my daughter know that I<br/>\nunderstand her desire to be with me and know what&#39;s going on behind a closed<br/>\ndoor.  Then to take the mystery away I&#39;d describe that I was sick and<br/>\nfeeling awful and that I needed some time alone and ask her if there was<br/>\nsomething she could do while Mommy was feeling that way so that I could have<br/>\nthat privacy.  Even if we didn&#39;t come up with something that felt<br/>\ndefinitive, my experience is that I&#39;d hear how much she cared, I&#39;d her<br/>\ntrying as best she could and that would likely be enough to take the edge<br/>\noff my frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day we had a scenario where my daughter, 5.7, defied my<br/>\nexpectations with her ability to choose to defer her wants to meet her 3 yr<br/>\nold brother&#39;s and mine.  My husband had just come home from work and I was<br/>\ntrying to get out to go jogging.  I&#39;d already deferred the jog from the<br/>\nmorning before when my son, who is usually touchy but okay with me going,<br/>\nhad really dug in his heels and wailed and expressed how much he needed me<br/>\nto not go.  He&#39;d agreed that this evening when Daddy got home would work<br/>\nbetter so I&#39;d agreed to wait a day.  I&#39;d reminded him about it, and he<br/>\nseemed fine.  Then Dad got home with a video from the library (where he<br/>\nworks) for each kid.  My daughter put hers on to watch.  A few minutes later<br/>\nmy son came in to where I was putting on my jogging things and said &quot;Bill<br/>\nNye is too long, Mama&quot;.  I said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re waiting to watch your video and<br/>\nyou feel like Aline&#39;s Bill Nye video is too long for you to wait?&quot;  He said<br/>\n&quot;Yes&quot;.  I said &quot;Well Aline&#39;s video has two stories.  How about if she<br/>\nwatches one story, you watch your video, then she watches the other story?&quot;<br/>\nThis has worked in the past and he trotted off seemingly happy enough.  A<br/>\nfew minutes later I heard him bawling to my confused husband in front of the<br/>\nTV set.  I went in and asked him what was going on.  He kept crying.  I said<br/>\n&quot;Are you just wanting to watch your video first?&quot;  He cried &quot;Yes!&quot;  I<br/>\nexpressed his desire to my daughter who said &quot;Well I want to watch mine<br/>\nfirst&quot;.  So I offered what we do a lot - a &quot;fair&quot; way of deciding where I<br/>\nput the videos under a towel or behind my back and a kid picks which hand or<br/>\ntowel and that one is first.  That usually works, but today Nicky was having<br/>\na tough time and just wasn&#39;t going for it.  He wanted to know which hand his<br/>\nvideo was in.  He just wanted it NOW.  I was getting frustrated - would I<br/>\never get out on this run?  What about my needs?  I could choose to just walk<br/>\nout, and leave them to Dad who is not as patient as I, but I know the trauma<br/>\nthat would feel like to my child.  So I said to my daughter, &quot;Aline, I know<br/>\nwhat I&#39;m about to ask you is not the fair way.  But Nicky is super cranky,<br/>\nhe really wants his video first today and is having a tough time.  I&#39;d<br/>\nreally like to get out on my run now which I&#39;ve been waiting to go on.  I&#39;d<br/>\nreally appreciate it if you could reconsider and let him have his video<br/>\nfirst.  What do you say?&quot;  And she shocked me and said &quot;Well, okay, Mom.&quot;<br/>\nI&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t blow my top.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":100027905,"authorName":"TreeGoddess","from":"TreeGoddess &lt;treegoddess@...&gt;","profile":"odrade7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Everyone is Different -- Bed Times","postDate":"1088256024","msgId":1088,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1MkQ4Q0Y0LUM3NzMtMTFEOC1CQTUyLTAwMDM5M0E1REE2NkBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGNiaXRkZytkcG1iQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNiaXRkZytkcG1iQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":1087,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":1087,"nextInTime":1089,"topicId":1030,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I know before <br/>\nCrystal used to get very upset at 5pm when Daddy normally came home <br/>\nbut then didn&#39;t. Now with him working double shift, we have no idea <br/>\nwhen he will start or come home.

So trying to change my <br/>\ndaughters sleep patterns is not likely to work. I have to leave her <br/>\nto learn for herself by providing a good example. I think that going <br/>\nto bed and staying awake to listen is worth trying. If nothing else I <br/>\nread in bed as is, and it could provide me good wind down time on her <br/>\nscedual. I can change myself, though the will power has not been my <br/>\nstrong point in this battle against the sleep demon! I always asumed <br/>\nI had to go to bed after her.... {shaked head free of clouds} it <br/>\nstill amazes me how many things I asume about life must be true <br/>\nsimply because that is how I saw things growing up. <br/>\n<br/>\n I do want my child to have choices, and to know that her needs and <br/>\nwants are just as important as mine.

Perhaps you mis-identified the cause of the grumpiness, since it is<br/>\nstill there, and the real cause is something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nJayn gets really grumpy with her Daddy when he has been spending a lot of<br/>\ntime out of the house (while she is awake). He makes a special effort to<br/>\nreconnect with her, pretty much not reacting emotionally to her &quot;go aways&quot;<br/>\nand raspberries, in favor of asking her if she is upset, and why, and would<br/>\nshe like to go wrestle (their special game) for a while (&quot;Yes! Let&#39;s<br/>\nwrestle!&quot;). That helps more than getting angry at her for being<br/>\ndevelopmentally unable to just say, &quot;Gee I missed you, can you give me some<br/>\nof your time and attention for a while?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Everyone is different, and I am seeing it as a great danger to my <br/>\nfamily to be so unstructered. My daughter does not seem to like <br/>\nhaving all these choices.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI only saw you mention one relaxed choice - bedtimes. It seems that in one<br/>\nother important area, when she can get your attention, she has no choices<br/>\nwhatsoever. That sounds harsh. I don&#39;t mean it to be, because it sounds to<br/>\nme like you are on the right track of asking your loved ones to help YOU get<br/>\nback into rhythm with your child. Demanding that *she* change may not be as<br/>\nworkable. Is she getting enough sleep? Is there some external factor waking<br/>\nher at 9am? Is she in the same bed as you are? What is keeping *you* up if<br/>\nshe is going to bed between 2 and 3, other than just being on a bad<br/>\nschedule? Was there some major event to push you to 7am?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot getting much day/sunlight also makes me feel more tired than otherwise,<br/>\nbut we are on a rotating schedule so my night living is brief. When I am<br/>\nextra tired I make an effort to move more gently, to keep reminding myself<br/>\nthat I am tired and so to think carefully before I speak. I also tell Jayn<br/>\nand dh that I am feeling tired, so that I can stem some of the requests that<br/>\nway. Nor do I bother with tidying up Jayn&#39;s last couple of games before bed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who has done a lot of odd changing shift work in my time,<br/>\nincluding working graveyard for a long time in an all night café, I can tell<br/>\nyou that in trying to switch your schedule, going to bed before you are<br/>\nsleepy is futile without pharmaceutical help of some kind. My dh swears by<br/>\nmelatonin. The best thing I and many of my colleagues in the film biz have<br/>\nfound, is to force yourself to stay awake &quot;around the clock&quot; once, until the<br/>\ndesired &quot;normal&quot; bedtime is reached. In your case that might be when your dd<br/>\nis going to bed - at around 2am. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion would be to organize your baby-sitter just for the around<br/>\nthree hours of overlap from when she gets up at 9am until you want to get up<br/>\nat 12.00, if you still need 10 hours. Sometimes sleeping a lot longer than<br/>\nusual is a sign of depression.<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally sympathize with the desire to be near dd when she is awake. I<br/>\nmentioned in my other post that I lie down on the sofa near Jayn. Can you<br/>\nhave a really special enjoyable activity that she can do in the bedroom near<br/>\nyour bed (if that is where you sleep) to allow you to at least snooze? <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I know personally, I do not always know <br/>\nwhat is good for me or how to get it. I know I am asking friend and <br/>\nfamily to help me get my day time night time life back together for <br/>\nthe betterment of all. Some kids do not know how to ask for that <br/>\nhelp, does not mean they do not need it!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m worried that you are mixing a bunch of issues into one maelstrom of<br/>\ndifficulty. You may not be aware of how much you are using some very<br/>\nnegative self-talk and negative self-labeling, and that you are sliding<br/>\nthese across to your kids - possibly without real foundation. Being<br/>\n&quot;contrary&quot; is a great part of being almost 5 years old. It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>\nshe will always lack self control. Do you have a friend or someone with whom<br/>\nyou could talk about your own issues, outside of parenting?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Getting no sleep or giving up time during the day to sleep<br/>\nyourself, and living with a grumpy daughter is certainly a situation I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t want to be in.  I can understand why you are feeling like limits<br/>\nwere better!  If you sincerely feel that you just need to go back to setting<br/>\na bedtime, then I respect that is where you are at.  If you feel you&#39;d like<br/>\nto find some kind of alternate arrangement where your daughter can still<br/>\nhave some choice and autonomy and where you can also get your needs met,<br/>\nthen I have a few thoughts for you to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned that you feel compelled to stay up with your daughter to make<br/>\nsure she is safe.  One of the things that works well for me to get my kids<br/>\n(5 & 3) to bed in a non-coercive way when they really do seem flat out tired<br/>\nis for me to head to bed myself.  How would you feel about trying that for a<br/>\nfew nights and seeing if she follows?  You can lie there awake and listen<br/>\nfor any problems - certainly if my kids are not tired they could care less<br/>\nif I&#39;m in bed generally, but if they are tired (and it sounds like with her<br/>\nclock set off to get up early all the time, your daughter could be<br/>\novertired) mine do follow and I&#39;m wondering if your daughter might do the<br/>\nsame.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option I&#39;d explore in your situation which I&#39;ve been in with other<br/>\nissues, but not bedtime ones, is talking to her about the situation and your<br/>\nfeelings.  Let her know what you observe about her grumpiness, that it&#39;s<br/>\nmore fun for Mom when she is not grumpy, that you need more sleep, and see<br/>\nif you can all come up with a solution together.  Maybe you can agree on a<br/>\ntime at night to start &quot;winding down&quot; in bed.  I know for me agreements that<br/>\ntake into consideration all our needs may feel better than my imposing rules<br/>\nand they leave the door open to changes and future discussions.  Could be<br/>\nthat after a while your daughter&#39;s clock will get deregulated and allow her<br/>\nto sleep in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you do not feel that these suggestions are attacking your decisions.<br/>\nI respect whatever decision you feel you need to make, but it sounds like<br/>\nyou see some benefit to your daughter having choices and feeling involved<br/>\nand I think you may be able to get your needs met without going back to<br/>\nsetting a bedtime if you desire to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJoan<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kimberly [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Kontessa_Rose@...\">Kontessa_Rose@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 24, 2004 11:42 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Everyone is Different -- Bed Times<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I has been reading both sides of this.
