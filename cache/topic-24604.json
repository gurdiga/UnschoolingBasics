I was <br/>\nthinking of taking him to the doctor when I realized that we had <br/>\njust read over a book on anatomy that he loves (mainly because it <br/>\nexplains where poop comes from) and he was enthralled by the books <br/>\ndescription of bones, xrays, and breaks.  He was making broken bones <br/>\nmake sense in his mind and body by having the problem with his leg.  <br/>\nI am sad to say that it took me hours before I realized it, even <br/>\nthough he chose to express his pain in the exact same spot and the <br/>\nexact same bone that the book showed with a break.  So I just got <br/>\nhim ice and helped him rest his leg until he decided it had healed.  <br/>\nHe needed me to take him seriously and the old me would have told <br/>\nhim it wasn&#39;t anything and tried to reason him out of his &quot;pain&quot;.  <br/>\nBut trying to get in tune to his way of thinking is important to <br/>\nknowing who he is and what he is trying to do even though he <br/>\ncommunicates it differently than I would.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"hammy454","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Behavior problem(?)","postDate":"1182783102","msgId":24688,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1b2twdStra291QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY1Y2RpZCtzY2NoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24606,"nextInTopic":24713,"prevInTime":24687,"nextInTime":24689,"topicId":24604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... just turned 3.

Help!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Hi I wanted to chime in here. I have a daughter who is also very <br/>\nintune with her body. When her dad was deployed to Iraq I noticed <br/>\nthat when she was having a bad day she was full of hurts (tiny <br/>\nlittle ones) and when she was having a good day the hurts all went <br/>\naway. I think maybe she is expressing the emotions by her body. <br/>\nThink about when we are sad how does that feel in the body? Just by <br/>\nlots of cheap bandaids and hand them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sounds JUST like my daughter and i have heard the same things <br/>\nthat I let her get away with everything. I respond with she is a <br/>\nperson too and kids can have a bad time and situation too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I hear the demanding voice it is usually because she is trying <br/>\nto get what she wants NOW and I use that Mom voice too. So is she <br/>\nrepeating what she is hearing. Do you use a SLIGHTLY different tone <br/>\nwith her when you really want something done now and she is modeling <br/>\nthat back. I just say &quot;yes I would love to get you this or that&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMeet her where she is and just love her to death, talk about what is <br/>\nbugging her and really listen. If her foot hurts ask her what she <br/>\nneeds and if she doesnot know then make it game to figure out what <br/>\nwill help her foot and by doing that with heal her heart as well<br/>\n<br/>\nhope that helps</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142317298,"authorName":"tracy","from":"&quot;tracy&quot; &lt;tracyliebmann@...&gt;","profile":"blessedinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Behavior problem(?)","postDate":"1182396557","msgId":24606,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY1Y3JhZCtja3J0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGY1Y2RpZCtzY2NoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24604,"nextInTopic":24688,"prevInTime":24605,"nextInTime":24607,"topicId":24604,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sylvia~ ...

If this is an isolated thing <br/>\nwith your DD I would wonder what the underlying need is? I would just <br/>\nvalidate and not try to &quot;fix&quot; the problem. Tell her about some odd <br/>\npain you had that bothered you for no apparent reason, then just went <br/>\naway. If you feel sure there is no &quot;medical&quot; problem, listen, love <br/>\nand keep things low key. Try not to put all your energy into trying <br/>\nto figure out &quot;whats wrong&quot;, put all your energy into validating and <br/>\nbeing with your daughter.
