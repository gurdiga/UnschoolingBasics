Finally updated and with the correct address. Look forward to all the feedback I can get. This is my first blog. I am a member of a lot of homeschool groups, so if you leave a comment, please let me know which group you are from so I can reply to you!<br/>\n  Oh yeah, and there&#39;s suppose to be a way to add this link to the resource page of each group, but I don&#39;t know how. Anyone with that ability, please feel free to do so. Don&#39;t forget to check out archives.<br/>\n  Looking forward to getting to know you all a bit better through this blog.<br/>\n  Tracy in Ohio<br/>\n  Mom of Sadie and Foster parent.<br/>\n  God Bless<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNeed Mail bonding?<br/>\nGo to the Yahoo!
