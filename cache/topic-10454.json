I had never wanted him to go to PS but my <br/>\nhusband Disagreed strongly and because of the typical &quot;social needs&quot; <br/>\ntheory we kept him there (what a crock that was). He is home with us <br/>\nnow after a suicide attempt at school and we are learning about <br/>\nUnschooling. The Points of view shared on this list have been <br/>\nwonderful for us to discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough our son has to finish out the &quot;school year&quot; in the <br/>\nhomebound program in order to pass the state tests this year we are <br/>\nprepairing for when that is over with. He is already a much happier <br/>\nperson than I have seen in years, he is making friends with people <br/>\nin a local hs/us group we have joined and I simply can not express <br/>\nhow my happy my husband and I am. <br/>\n Next &quot;school year&quot; we are going to register our son with the <br/>\nHomelife Acadamy Umbrella school and let them handle the paperwork <br/>\nand such.<br/>\nAlthough doing so we will be going directly against the wishes of <br/>\nour parents and the recomendation of Galens specalist- who is a jerk <br/>\nand said if we took Galen from school he would die, not only did he <br/>\nnot DIE he is thriving! and we are changing dr.s<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read posts from people who come to this list askig how to do <br/>\nUnschooling and I find for myself and my family that unschooling is <br/>\nnot somthing we would &quot;do&quot; but more of a change in lifestyle for the <br/>\nwhole family. Slowly things are changing here and I think it is <br/>\ngood, while we have always been a family without many &quot;rules&quot; we <br/>\nhave some so deeply ingrained in us that I never stopped to even <br/>\nthink they were &quot;rules&quot;. those are the things we are slowly <br/>\nchanging, like no sweets till you eat somthing good. That was <br/>\ningrained into me as a young teen when it was discovered I had a <br/>\nblood sugar problem and so thats been the unspoken &quot;rule&quot; at our <br/>\nhome, untill I joined here I never thought to even think twice about <br/>\nit. (I wonder how it is that we can be so blind to things?)<br/>\nBut I find that stepping away from the &#39;rules&quot; slowly instead of all <br/>\nat once works well for us,I think everything all at once would be a <br/>\nhuge shock to the system and cause a lot of chaos.<br/>\nWe do not have many things to change, like perhaps many others would <br/>\nso I suppose I am thnakful that the idea does not seem overwhelming.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband who was always very negitive about keeping our son home <br/>\nis now not only agreable to homeschooling but activly discussing and <br/>\ninterested in changing our lifestyle to a more unschooling approach.<br/>\nThat is how we see it, a lifestyle not a method..<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for my son, he is a darling boy, very sweet & polite and I think <br/>\nit will take time away from the &#39;school&#39; enviroment for him to stop <br/>\nasking me &quot;can I go to the bathroom&quot; &quot;can I (whatever)&quot; I am just <br/>\ngoing to be patient and say yes as much as I possibly can and I <br/>\nthink with time he will stop asking about the silly things (like the <br/>\nbathroom!!)and just go on about his buisness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe came to me last week when he ran out of birthday money and asked <br/>\nme if he could do the dishes for us in exchange for cash. (he knows <br/>\nthe dishes creep me out) I was kind of surprised by that, okay not <br/>\nkind of, more like very-- but willing to give him money so I dont <br/>\nhave to do them. I wondered briefly if that would be looked down <br/>\nuppon in the unschooling comunity and then I figured if he wanted to <br/>\nand I wanted to then it didnt matter if someone else thought it was <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe only major problem I forsee is our familys I know they will be <br/>\ncalling and asking &quot;what did you learn today&quot; &quot;do you know what 763 <br/>\ndevided by 8 is? &quot;when did pearl harbor get bombed?&quot; They could <br/>\nnever in a million years understand unschooling and would never be <br/>\nwilling to accept that I was doing that, I have already been <br/>\nthreatened to put my son back in PS next year &quot;or else&quot; thankfully <br/>\nthey live in another state and I doubt they could sue me for <br/>\ncustody. I hope they can&#39;t I suppose I had ebtter check the laws.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nso thank you all for sharing your wisdom I am learning a lot here.<br/>\nDiana</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":10518,"nextTopicId":10507}}
