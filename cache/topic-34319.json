Also he has now (at six and three) gotten pretty good at just making another toy that he would not want but things his brother might really like seem VERY interesting. That will often get him distracted enough, or be willing to trade for the other thing. I tried to never take anything forcibly, but wait until the younger one was willing to give up the coveted toy. Distraction worked best, or finding something similar or the same - or doing/playing something else with the older that he really liked.<br/>\nTry as best as you can not to ever pry things out of their hands, because I think as long as they see that it works for you, it will work for them. Talking about how it feels if someone grabs from you can help. My younger one still needs gentle  reminders sometimes that he can just ask or talk to me if he wants something badly that the other one has.<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Jeanette Crichton &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jeanettec_99@...\">jeanettec_99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, July 2, 2008 10:30:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [unschoolingbasics] Some parenting questions<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne phrase that I help both of my boys use is &quot;may I please use that next&quot;.

Two year <br/>\nold sees sib playing with cool toy, put it down and considers it <br/>\nfairplay. Four year old not done and sees two year old as taking her <br/>\nstuff. Help them turn it. &quot; I think (dd 2)Kim thinks your baby is <br/>\nreally awesome. Lets help her find a really awesome toy to play with. <br/>\nI think she thought you were done. &quot; We had lots of little ones at <br/>\none and it really seemed to help when we had a policy of not taking <br/>\nsomething without trading something else. If a baby picked up <br/>\nsomething we would negotiate a trade off. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had toys, not mine and your toys but our toys. We still kind <br/>\nof do. The kids are way older and have personal possessions, but they <br/>\nenjoy sharing. Like one kid owns a ps2 the other the game Rock Band. <br/>\nIt works great for them to work together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this was a little bit helpful.
