I started <br/>\n experiencing depression and anxiety a year ago when we moved and  <br/>\n got into a huge remodeling project.  I was (and still am) trying to <br/>\n help my son with autism with special diets and such as well.  <br/>\n Anyway, it just hit me like a train and I had feelings I had never <br/>\n felt before.  I felt sweaty, scared, anxious and had huge adrenaline <br/>\n surges.  I would be soaking wet when I woke up from anxiety.  Later, <br/>\n I actually went on Paxil to try to get some help after talking to a <br/>\n psychiatrist.  It was the best thing I did to go see a <br/>\n professional.  The Paxil made all the anxiety and depression go away <br/>\n and I was on a very low dose.  I am not necessarily advocating Paxil <br/>\n (and I don&#39;t do meds with my son), but I reluctantly tried it at <br/>\n that time.  After 3 weeks of being on it, I felt like my old self <br/>\n and decided to go off of it, and I was so happy to realize that I <br/>\n didn&#39;t need it...but I know it&#39;s there if I ever feel that bad <br/>\n again.  <br/>\n <br/>\n There are some wonderful books out there as well that list many <br/>\n techniques for dealing with anxiety and depression.  I love &quot;Coping <br/>\n with Anxiety:  10 simple ways to relieve anxiety, fear and worry&quot;.  <br/>\n It is a PB that isn&#39;t too long and wordy (found in local bookstore <br/>\n less than a year ago).  The biggest thing that will help right now <br/>\n is major exercise.  It really makes a huge difference!  The book <br/>\n also discusses diet and how important eating right is right now.  <br/>\n There are also many herbs such as St. John&#39;s Wort (I started <br/>\n drinking Kava tea at bedtime) that the book discusses.  <br/>\n <br/>\n I think you are very wise to take her feeling this bad seriously.  <br/>\n It is very scary to feel miserable and in fight/flight mode all the <br/>\n time.  You feel like you will never enjoy life or be happy again.  <br/>\n And the nights were the worst!  I was also subscribed sleeping <br/>\n pills, which I used several times.  They worked effectively and so I <br/>\n wasn&#39;t so worried about the night and able to face it without <br/>\n dread.  I would also consider taking her to a doctor to check out <br/>\n hormone levels and such.  My dr. put me on progesterone cream, which <br/>\n helps with cortisol and adrenaline levels.  There is a ton of info <br/>\n if you check out &quot;anxiety and worry&quot; online.  <br/>\n <br/>\n In a way, I am glad I went through this, because I have learned many <br/>\n techniques to help me deal with scary and depressing situations.  I <br/>\n feel stronger with many tools available to cope with whatever the <br/>\n future holds.  I hope I helped in some way.  <br/>\n <br/>\n Beth--<br/>\n <br/>\n - In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;errika1990&quot; <br/>\n &lt;kkringle63@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;<br/>\n &gt; I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on dealing with <br/>\n </span></blockquote> depression<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt; in an adolescent.
