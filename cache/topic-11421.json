School doesnt allow children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-580649866\">Am I wrong to take him out so it&#39;s easier? &gt;&gt;&gt;I dont mean this as an insult ( Ill explain more in a minute) Easier for you or him? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  School doesnt allow children to question rules and some of their rules are downright stupid ( they arent allowed to eat their dessert untill they eat at least half the rest of their food) so in my opinion unless you want to raise your child to be a robot then send him to school to learn to follow rules is pointless. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  How does your son feel ? Has he always been in a school environment? Does he say he does not want to be homeschooled? Have you talked about the pro&#39;s and cons? <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My daughter has OCD and generalized anxiety disorder. I took her out in the middle of this year and she is making plans to go back to first grade at school and insisting on it. I hate that! I hope that at some point ( sooner better than later ) she will want to come home and stay home. I feel that its about freedom to allow children to think for themselves , make choices and learn from them........a natural way of learning not the you do what I tell you not to or sit in time out. It would be a lot easier for me not to have her up at the school at 7:15 every morning. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Ok bear with me and my scatter thoughts a minute longer. I want to share a story of my neighbors son that might give you and your son an idea of what school could be. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  JJ is a very bright 7 year old boy with adhd. He is doing great in baseball for his 2nd year, is great in math, dosent like reading much but he can tell some great stories about his &quot;adventures&quot; <br/>\n   <br/>\n  There is a creek that runs behind our backyards that he is fasinated with . ( well we call it the creek but its a big ditch really) He Loves to go down there . His mom does not love it and he has gotten spanking after spanking over this ditch . <br/>\n  My heart just bleeds for this little boy because I can just see the spark and wonder in his eyes , the excitement in his voice when I find him down there. He likes the sound of the water running over the rocks, the feel of the cold water on his feet. He likes trying to find different animals down there and is basicly making himself a refence quide with numerous sheets he has asked me to print on different animals ...esp snakes and turtles. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Mom says absolutely not no creek he might get bitten by a snake ( imo...true could happen but he could get hit in the head by a baseball, could fall off the playground equipment at school and break his neck if he landed just right..........) <br/>\n  and Im thinking ......................map skillls......sure would be neat to get a town map and see just exactly where the ditch goes to ........science .......could be identifying different creatures, taking water samples....looking at under a microscope, testing for different chemicals.........talking about what effect people throwing their old stuff in there could be having on the environment....math will just naturaly fall in when looking into how long the creek is, how many parts per billion there are of arsenic in the water sample. ....and on and on............<br/>\n   <br/>\n  You of course will know what is best for you and your family but Id suggest trying it for a year ( one semester bare minimum) and see how it goes. Unless a kid has been legaly suspended I dont think a US public school can ever refuse to re-enroll a child. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
