Could you recommend some websites, books,  <br/>\netc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have two hives. I got the hives themselves last Christmas and the bees  for <br/>\nthe following (early) Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you&#39;re going to have them *this* year, buy NOW! Get your hives asap and  <br/>\npaint them and get them ready for your &quot;girls.&quot; You need to hive your girls  in <br/>\nMarch/April, depending on your location---so it&#39;s time now to start making  <br/>\nplans!<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are some awful pests and diseases that are attacking bees right  <br/>\nnow---mites, hive beetles, and wax moths----just to name a few. Getting your  bees <br/>\ncan be hard because there&#39;s a severe shortage. I&#39;m trying to avoid  chemicals <br/>\nand pesticides, so I use teatree oil and powdered sugar and pipe  tobacco to <br/>\nkeep them healthy. You don&#39;t HAVE to use chemicals!<br/>\n <br/>\nThere are TONS of books and websites . I use Brushy Mountain Bee Farm ---  <br/>\n_www.beeequipment.com_ (http://www.beeequipment.com)  and their phone number is <br/>\n1-800-BEESWAX  &lt;g&gt; for  supplies AND bees.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut my best advice is to find a local beekeeper  who will help you.  Our <br/>\nbeekeepers association has a monthly  meeting with timely topics----and several <br/>\noldtimers volunteer to come out  and help you set up or check your bees or be on <br/>\ncall for all sorts of pathetic  questions! &lt;g&gt; They offer classes every <br/>\nspring for new and potential  keepers.<br/>\n <br/>\nAsk around---maybe with your local Agricultural department.<br/>\n <br/>\nI started with two hives, one smaller English Garden Hive and a larger  <br/>\n&quot;regular&quot; hive. I put 2 lbs of bees in the smaller hive and 3 lbs in the  larger <br/>\none, with marked queens. All together, I spent maybe $300? A friend gave  me her <br/>\nheavy duty bee suit----but some thick cover-alls and duct tape will  work.  <br/>\nMy BEEginner&#39;s Kit came with gloves and a veil as well as all the  hives tools.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey are (to me) absolutely the most fascinating creatures on the planet! I  <br/>\ncan sit out there all day and watch them fly out to forage---and when I enter  <br/>\nthe hives, I probably spend WAAAAY too much time just poking around! &lt;G&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nWe didn&#39;t rob them last year because I was more concerned with their having  <br/>\nenough food through their first winter. But they had loads of honey in there  <br/>\nyesterday when I checked---AND are already foraging in this stupid SC weather  <br/>\n(79 yesterday----but it&#39;ll be down to 19 this weekend). But it&#39;s standard  <br/>\npractice NOT to rob them the first year. You get a little honey the second; the  <br/>\nthird year on, you can plan on bumper crops! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nMy gardens were more vibrant and productive last year than ever before (I  <br/>\nhave fruit, vegetable, herb, and flower gardens) ----and I know it was  due to <br/>\nthe girls. I&#39;m the only one to have been stung (three times). The girls  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t bothered the children/pets at all.<br/>\n <br/>\nYour library should have numerous bee books, but if they don&#39;t, I&#39;d ask  <br/>\nBrushy Mountain what they&#39;d recommend. The web is chocked full, but I have none  <br/>\nbookmarked. But my best advice is another, experienced beekeeper. Jack and <br/>\nFrank  and Mike have been invaluable to me!<br/>\n <br/>\nOH! and just DOING it! &lt;g&gt; You&#39;ll learn SO much just by being  IN the hive! <br/>\n <br/>\n~Kelly, happy beekeeper<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4624,"nextTopicId":4618}}
