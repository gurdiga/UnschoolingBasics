There&#39;s a very sweet <br/>\nlullaby I learned that I&#39;ll still sing to them when they&#39;re sick or <br/>\nreally sleepy, but struggling. And a &quot;hopping&quot; rhyme for bouncing on <br/>\nyour knee. They&#39;re easier to remember too---with the rhymes and <br/>\npatterns and rhythms. I wish I knew more! But a children&#39;s book with <br/>\nlots of short rhymes would be a good investment---you know---like the <br/>\nGerman version of The Itsy Bitsy Spider? That kind of thing, with hand <br/>\nmotions too!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about the acquisition of the language---verb placement and...the <br/>\n...*rhythm* of the language is the best &quot;description&quot; I can come up <br/>\nwith---it&#39;s the *rhythm* that&#39;s important.

We were learning Attic Greek, translating <br/>\nEuripides and Plato and throwing in a little New Testament Greek for <br/>\nthe students who were planning on going to Seminary.  Greek was such <br/>\na logical, precise, yet poetic language - the most amazing <br/>\ncombination of reason and poetry that I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my pet theories of why English is such a complicated language <br/>\nis that there&#39;s a tremendous gap between our concrete, everyday <br/>\nlanguage (Anglo-Saxon) and our abstract, technical languages <br/>\n(stemming mostly from Greek and Latin).  What was wonderful about <br/>\nGreek was that the most abstract language of Plato grew directly out <br/>\nof the most concrete everyday language.  Even the most complex ideas <br/>\nhave a physical, experiential grounding in Greek that is sadly <br/>\nlacking in English.  Psyche means &quot;breath&quot;, and if you pronounce it <br/>\nin the Greek way it actually sounds like breathing in and breathing <br/>\nout - psoo kay.  The breath is the spirit of a person, the soul, the <br/>\ncenter.  Makes perfect sense when you think of it that way!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, kbcdlovejo@... wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>\n&gt; From: Debra Rossing &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a common root sort of - Catalan, Spanish, French, Italian <br/>\n(and<br/>\n&gt; others) are called the &quot;Romance&quot; languages because they are tied to<br/>\n&gt; Latin (&quot;Roman&quot;) language origins.

When we arrived in Spain we didnt <br/>\nknow a word of each langauge, but I have picked up quite a lot in the <br/>\npast few month. The one problem is I seem to be learning what I refer to <br/>\nas &#39;Spatalan&#39; - so strange hibrid mix of the 2 languages as I am picking <br/>\nit up form the people round me - shop keepers etc. I supose I am <br/>\nlearning they way small children do - hearing a sound and associating it <br/>\nwith an object or action - give me a whole new persepctive of what an <br/>\namazing job little ones do just learning to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find reading the langauge much easier -whichever one it is- and I <br/>\nthink that is because firtsly I am not rushed, with speach you hear it <br/>\nonce and have to try work it out - with something written you can keep <br/>\nlooking at it till you work it out, and secondly both Castillian and <br/>\nCatalan must havbe a similar &#39;root&#39; to at least some of English as if <br/>\nyou think about it you can sort of work it out - for example cuina is <br/>\ncooking - kind of like culinary, and a lot of words just look the same, <br/>\ntelevision and foto are quite easy to work out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I have got half a dozen words in a sentance it becomes more of a <br/>\n&#39;code breaking&#39; exercise, trying to work out the missing bits by <br/>\nthinking of what would make a logical sentance - things like if it has a <br/>\nquestion mark or exclamation mark help too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have been doing which is helping loads is reading Harry <br/>\nPotter. I am a great fan of the boy wizard and have read all the book so <br/>\nmany times that I know them quite well. So I have borrowed the books in <br/>\nCatalan from the local library and am &#39;reading&#39; them again. It really <br/>\nhelps that I know what it should be saying - I can always refer to the <br/>\nEnglish copy if I get stuck, and it a good way to pick up those everyday <br/>\nwords we use so much - and, but, also, perhaps, etc. and it shows the <br/>\ndifferences in verb structure too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the idea from  Swedish Home Ed family we met last year whose <br/>\nchildren had learnt English because they couldn&#39;t wait for the then next <br/>\nharry potter book to be published in Swedish!<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31780,"nextTopicId":31815}}
