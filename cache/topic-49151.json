There&#39;s even a handy acronym:HALT (hungry, antsy, lonely, tired) to help you remember those. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes if you&#39;re aware of things like that, you can head off a melt down before it happens - you see things getting tense and remember the kids are probably hungry so you swoop in with a snack. Or you know someone&#39;s probably tired and suggest something like a movie or a bath... something calming to your specific kids. Or maybe you do a mental check and realize your daughter may need some more attention - it&#39;s entirely possible that&#39;s a huge factor in her big reactions, if she&#39;s not getting enough attention (from her perspective, not yours) and is afraid you don&#39;t take her feelings seriously. All that drama may be her way of saying &quot;You&#39;re Not Seeing/Hearing Me!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;She is very demanding, always has to have her way or &quot;IM not playing!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You also said her brothers do things she doesn&#39;t like most of the time - that sounds pretty stressful to her! She&#39;s getting the short end of the stick from her perspective. Look for ways to play with her more and let her be in charge of things - do it her way for her so she has some sense of control over her life. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre her brothers older or younger? If they&#39;re older, you may be able to talk with them and ask them to try and do things her way now and then, as a way of keeping the peace. It can&#39;t be pleasant for them to have a sister having a huge melt down! If you&#39;ve treated it as a matter of her &quot;getting her way&quot; in the past, they may need some coaching to Let her get her way as an experiment to see if it makes home life more pleasant. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Dramatic 5 yr old daughter","postDate":"1350424615","msgId":49155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTA0MjQ2MTUuMzU1OTkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs1a2RxMyttMWEyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs1aTQ3NSthbWFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8azVrZHEzK20xYTJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":49154,"nextInTopic":49157,"prevInTime":49154,"nextInTime":49156,"topicId":49151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Start here: http://sandradodd.com/help Now this pare is great and at the bottom there is a sound file that is awesome:| ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1576761731\">Start here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/help\">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow this pare is great and at the bottom there is a sound file that is awesome:|<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand Pam Laricchia has a great series of emails for newbies that I highly recommend together with her book.<br/>\nSign up for the daily emails.

This doesn t help you help her and it s dismissive of her feelings.  She s having big feelings and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-379416245\">The first step is to stop labeling your child as dramatic.  This doesn&#39;t help you help her and it&#39;s dismissive of her feelings.  She&#39;s having big feelings and she&#39;s expressing them loudly, and possibly hurtfully.  Her distress increases when you send her to her room because what she needs is not isolation, but proof that someone loves and cares and will be there for her when she&#39;s feeling out of control.  It gets so much scarier to feel like you&#39;re unable to control yourself and also feel like no one has your back...no one cares...no one will help.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I&#39;m guessing that your goal is to get her to be quieter and less hurtful when things don&#39;t go her way.  That may not happen.  If your goal becomes to help her feel supported and protect her from her own out of control (out of her own control... not yours) behavior... helping her not get hurt, helping her maintain relationships she&#39;d like to keep, helping her emotions flow past instead of getting stuck.... then there are options.  And when that is addressed the emotions seem to pass more quickly.  In general I don&#39;t like making assumptions about what my children want...but during those times of intense emotions she may not be able to connect with what she really wants/needs...or she&#39;s stuck on a specific WAY that she sees it happening and can&#39;t see it in any other way...I&#39;ll assume that my child does not want to hurt anyone, does not want to be unfair (or be treated unfairly)- I go by what I know of her in &quot;normal&quot; situations.   It usually doesn&#39;t help to look at other options until the emotions have passed...but here it always comes back to finding solutions that work for everyone.  When my own child was 5 I&#39;d boil it all down to &quot;she&#39;d like this, how can we make this happen in a way that feels good to everyone&quot;.  Sometimes the rest of us would brainstorm possibilities while she was still stuck and present them as soon as she could hear them.  I&#39;d try to imagine what she is saying as if it wasn&#39;t being screamed...and translated into what I might say in a similar situation &quot;I don&#39;t like what my brother is doing and I&#39;d like him to stop&quot;.  Sometimes I translate for my kids into language that isn&#39;t emotionally charged  &quot;She doesn&#39;t like that and would like you to stop&quot;- and we whittle down to what the real issue is &quot;oh, it&#39;s the noise? Can you do that in another room?  Or outside?&quot;  Until we find a reasonable and agreeable solution.  Living with other people can be a challenge!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mainstream a common response is to take whatever the child wants off the table as an option....it&#39;s often called &quot;consequences&quot; but what it really is is punishment for having big emotions and expressing them.  Here we look for the need inside the desire and simply allow the emotions.  I don&#39;t try to stop them any more than I&#39;d try to stop a thunderstorm....and honestly I don&#39;t have that power any more than I would with a thunderstorm.  But I do address what&#39;s bringing the emotions up.  Sometimes it&#39;s a buildup of stresses that come to a head and it all just needs to release (it&#39;s been weeks since a blow up here, but yesterday my parents left after visiting for nearly 2 weeks......and there were a few other things that just became too much... though my child&#39;s expressed focus was &quot;I&#39;m bored, there isn&#39;t anything to do&quot; and &quot;what I want to do isn&#39;t available to me right now&quot;- which is a sort of default for her- and the whole thing was triggered by some normal everyday question I asked her- she&#39;s 12, I think I asked if she&#39;d empty the dishwasher...and was perfectly willing to accept a no).  Sometimes it IS her brain&#39;s tendency to stick on one specific idea....but that&#39;s decreasing over time.  A neurotypical child (and your child probably is...this honestly sounds pretty standard for a 5yo) will mature out of the screaming pretty quickly...likely when the neurological structures develop that allow her to make logical connections between the things that are happening so that she&#39;s not emotionally overwhelmed by them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe books Joyce mentioned are helpful, but are from a mainstream perspective.  Most of the things they suggest, if you&#39;re an unschooler, you&#39;re probably already doing.  For me the relief in them was knowing there were other kids like my kid... and knowing that what we were already doing was the best option anyone had come up with so far....and that this isn&#39;t caused by connected, kind, loving parenting like so many &quot;muggles&quot; would seem to believe....plenty of kids raised in the mainstream are challenged with this as well and frankly are doing much worse because of the attempts to use force and punishment to change their behavior.  What I&#39;m finding most helpful is understanding emotions and the purposes they serve- Karla McLaren writes very eloquently and deeply on emotions and emotional sensitivity.   For whatever reason, some children&#39;s emotions seem amplified.... I&#39;m beginning to suspect that with my own child there are some BIG sensory processing differences that may underlie all of it.   But that may not be your situation at all.   Again, some small kids scream....and 5yo is  a pretty typical age for this.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLesley <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://euphorialifedesignstudio.com\">http://euphorialifedesignstudio.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Dramatic 5 yr old daughter","postDate":"1350379489","msgId":49152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY1Qjc4ODQ2LUU5QTMtNDAxRi1BNEYzLUVGMTdGMjk5NDJDOUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGs1aTQ3NSthbWFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGs1aTQ3NSthbWFqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49151,"nextInTopic":49153,"prevInTime":49151,"nextInTime":49153,"topicId":49151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
