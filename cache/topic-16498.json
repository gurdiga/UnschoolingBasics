Thanks so much for your reply!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I just unpacked all of our books though and I <br/>\n&gt; think that&#39;s what put me into panic mode. I&#39;m feeling more relaxed <br/>\n&gt; now. Breathing helps. ;-)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Put all those books on a shelf - some of them might be handy <br/>\nreferences for answering questions you don&#39;t know the answers to <br/>\n(but I&#39;m betting in about a year they&#39;ll be all dusty and ready to <br/>\ngo up onto ebay). If any of them really makes you get nervous <br/>\nrepeatedly, get rid of it fast. I gave away a few things I had <br/>\naccumulated when DS was a baby &quot;just in case&quot; (like 100EZ lessons - <br/>\nhey I found it on sale brand new for 30% off!lol) to our homeschool <br/>\ngroup&#39;s lending library. I figure someone might want to look at it <br/>\nbefore buying for themselves (and maybe they&#39;ll look at it and <br/>\ndecide not to buy any reading lessons at all lol).<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is something that my hubby and I both need to work on. I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; usually pretty relaxed about stuff, but sometimes I say &quot;no&quot; for <br/>\n&gt;no <br/>\n&gt; good reason, because I don&#39;t want to be bothered at that moment. <br/>\n&gt; Then the kids start to argue with me and their dad gets upset <br/>\n&gt; because they don&#39;t &quot;respect&quot; us and before you know it we&#39;re all <br/>\n&gt; upset. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an excellent start at it - recognizing that sometimes you say <br/>\nno simply for your own convenience. If DS asks and I say No, it&#39;s <br/>\nusually because I just don&#39;t want to do that. And that&#39;s okay - I&#39;ll <br/>\nthink about it, maybe ask a couple questions to define exactly what <br/>\nit is he wants my participation to be, and decide if it is something <br/>\nI am willing to do. Since No is considered and not constant <br/>\n(sometimes I play, sometimes not, it depends on many factors, <br/>\nincluding things like if he&#39;s asking me to play something long like <br/>\nMonopoly or Risk at 10 pm). <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So, basically just be available right?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Exactly - think about how you and DH lived before kids. You didn&#39;t <br/>\nhover over each other but you probably hung out together. I remember <br/>\ncurling up on the bed in the spare room to read while DH played <br/>\ncomputer games on the computer in there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does this mean I no longer have an excuse for the dirty dishes in <br/>\n&gt; the sink?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>LOL - usually DH does the dishes at our house (he&#39;s home, I&#39;m at <br/>\nwork) but sometimes I&#39;ll do them. I make sure we&#39;ve got the dish <br/>\nsoap I like (the orange oil scented ones) and I&#39;ll treat it *as* a <br/>\ntreat - my guys will usually head off to play somewhere and I get <br/>\nsome quiet and I get to look out the back window and think long slow <br/>\nthoughts. Sometimes I&#39;ll even use the time to pray if there&#39;s <br/>\nsomething I need to really spend time praying on. Sometimes just <br/>\nseeing the residue on the dishes can remind me of things <br/>\nlike &quot;that&#39;s the leftovers of DH&#39;s birthday cake - that was a nice <br/>\nparty - I&#39;m so glad to have him...&quot; or &quot;boy that chili was spicy!&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;I&#39;m glad we had company over for pizza the other day&quot;. Sort of <br/>\ntriggers to being thankful instead of seeing it as a chore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; See, this is part of the reason I&#39;m looking for another way to do <br/>\n&gt; things. The kids aren&#39;t asking as many questions as they used to. <br/>\n&gt;I <br/>\n&gt; know it&#39;s my fault because I was always trying to turn every <br/>\n&gt; question they had into some kind of a lesson. So I&#39;ve backed off <br/>\n&gt;and <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll start asking again. How do I handle it when <br/>\n&gt;they <br/>\n&gt; do ask? Just give a simple, strait-forward answer, then asking <br/>\n&gt;them <br/>\n&gt; if they&#39;d like to learn more? <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>KISS lol &quot;Keep it simple Stacey&quot; If they want to know more, they&#39;ll <br/>\nask more. If the same types of questions keep coming up (for <br/>\ninstance, my DS kept asking why it&#39;s called... a window, a door, a <br/>\nceiling, a pillow, an armada, etc), find resources they can use - I <br/>\nfound a cool website that gives the etymology of hundreds of words <br/>\n(you can search specifically or hit the first letter and scroll <br/>\nthrough the list) and I bookmarked it on DS&#39; computer so he can <br/>\ncheck stuff at will - he&#39;s somewhat independent from me (as <br/>\nindependent as he chooses - he can look it up, he can ask me if I <br/>\nknow, he can ask me to look it up). If you keep getting questions <br/>\nabout spiders, get a good field guide to spiders or bookmark a <br/>\nwebsite (or both).<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212934673,"authorName":"Michelle/Melbrigða","from":"&quot;=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Michelle/Melbrig=F0a?=&quot; &lt;pamperedmichelle@...&gt;","profile":"scrapgal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Newbie to list and unschooling :-)","postDate":"1155838911","msgId":16545,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MTcxMTIxbjVjZGYyM2QzcmIwMDRlZjNkMGJmYWIzYjFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGVjMGFyZys0MTA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY4NWIyZjIwNjA4MTUxMzEycjUzZmQyYjdlaGU3ZjkzMjEzOTczNTExNDBAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8ZWMwYXJnKzQxMDdAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":16542,"nextInTopic":16548,"prevInTime":16544,"nextInTime":16546,"topicId":16498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Seriously, this is a great unschooling movie.<br/>\nHere&#39;s a &quot;kid&quot; who looks 30 and he knows toys best.  He gets a job<br/>\ndesigning and testing toys.  My brother would have been great at a job<br/>\nlike that!  No college education, no high school education for that<br/>\nmatter.  Just a kid who &quot;grew up&quot; too fast.

If <br/>\nyou&#39;re in panic mode, learning can&#39;t get in and you&#39;re more likely <br/>\nto cling onto the flimsy branch you know than let go and FLY.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing is don&#39;t do anything suddenly. Except maybe dropping the <br/>\ntextbook/workbook/&#39;school day&#39; stuff. That can go away and it can <br/>\nbe &#39;vacation time&#39;. All the rest of the control stuff (food, <br/>\nbedtime, etc) needs to go slowly for everyone&#39;s sake or it&#39;ll get <br/>\nreally confusing and frustrating. Instead of an &quot;okay there are no <br/>\nmore rules&quot; pronouncement, just say Yes a whole lot more - &quot;Can we <br/>\nstay up to watch one more show? Yes&quot; &quot;Can I have another freeze pop? <br/>\nYes&quot; and so on. Take a breath or two and think before answering No <br/>\nto anything (except maybe &quot;No, don&#39;t use the baby as a speed bump&quot; <br/>\nlol)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What they need&quot;? What *they* need or what the school system (which <br/>\nis playing in your head) says they need? Those are usually different <br/>\nthings. The school system tapes say &quot;They have to learn <br/>\nmultiplication at age 8 and reading by age 6 and...&quot; Reality is that <br/>\nthose are tools to reach a goal not an end in themselves - which is <br/>\nthe way school is - you learn multiplication or reading because <br/>\nsomeone else says so, not because you have a real life need for it <br/>\nat the time. Do you go out and pound a dozen nails every day &quot;just <br/>\nin case&quot; you need to do a bit of carpentry in 10 years? You&#39;ve <br/>\nprobably got plenty of other stuff to do I&#39;m sure - stuff that is <br/>\nreal and now and important to *you*.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat to do with yourself: definitely spend some time with the kids. <br/>\nBe involved with them sometimes. Be nearby sometimes - maybe read or <br/>\nwhatever in the big comfy chair while they&#39;re sprawled around the <br/>\nliving room watching Spongebob or snakes or Unwrapped or whatever. <br/>\nAlso spend time for yourself - get out the knitting or bonsai trees <br/>\nor the bagpipes or whatever - something you&#39;ve put aside maybe or <br/>\nsomething you&#39;ve wanted to explore for yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nLive as though every day were vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What if they only want to play barbies<br/>\n </span></blockquote>hmm fashion design, interior design, graphics, cosmetology, <br/>\nscreenwriting (soap operas for sure), and so on are all potential <br/>\ndirections that a love of barbies could go (and there are probably <br/>\nzillions more. Get them barbie magazines. Find barbie websites for <br/>\nthem. And so on. barbie collectibles bring big bucks on ebay <br/>\nsometimes. Oh and don&#39;t forget that sewing might be in there when <br/>\nthey want to expand the wardrobes and possibly carpentry (to make <br/>\nminiature furnishings and such)...there&#39;s a whole world all <br/>\nconnected to barbie (where is malibu and why is malibu barbie so tan <br/>\nand won&#39;t she get skin cancer and what is in sunscreen and ....) Be <br/>\nprepared for lots of questions that you don&#39;t know the answers to <br/>\n(there&#39;s no answer key to living life).

Do you know for sure what they&#39;ll <br/>\nned to know 10 years from now? Could you have imagined surfing the <br/>\nInternet when you were their age? Computer skills are critical <br/>\ntoday - and I graduated high school before the IBM PC was invented <br/>\nand when I graduated college, I got a &quot;top of the line personal <br/>\ncomputer&quot; as a gift - it was a Commodore 64! My college degree is in <br/>\nInformation Systems. Guess what I learned? Punch cards and IBM <br/>\nAssembly language and Pascal and COBOL. Virtually NONE of what I <br/>\ntook in *college* has any relation to my current career. DH waited a <br/>\nfull decade after high school to consider college and choose to <br/>\nleave a 5 figure salary to pursue something he was passionate about <br/>\nvia a college degree (that&#39;s where the resources he wanted were <br/>\nlumped so that&#39;s where he went). Now he&#39;s a full time at home Dad, <br/>\nby choice. He uses his degree on occasion. If you had asked him when <br/>\nhe graduated high school if he&#39;d ever have a college degree he&#39;d <br/>\nhave laughed at you. He got his high paying high tech job(s) without <br/>\nso much as an ITT Tech certificate. The skills that got him those <br/>\njobs were those he learned *outside of school*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you spend all your time now worrying about 10 years from now, <br/>\npretty soon it will BE 10 years from now and you&#39;ll have missed all <br/>\nthe now.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276785111,"authorName":"Stacy","from":"&quot;Stacy&quot; &lt;smurphygt@...&gt;","profile":"smurphygt","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Newbie to list and unschooling :-)","postDate":"1155662457","msgId":16498,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVic3ZwcCtrNHJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16500,"prevInTime":16497,"nextInTime":16499,"topicId":16498,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello list!

My name&#39;s Stacy and I&#39;m mom to 3 great kids, Aidan 9, <br/>\nAshlyn 7, & Kian 13mos. We&#39;ve homeschooled from the beginning, but <br/>\nafter 4 years of relaxed school-at-home, we&#39;ve got issues. Somehow I <br/>\ncan take anything my kids are interested in and make it boring. <br/>\nMention a favorite game might have educational value, and they never <br/>\ntouch it again. Ask them to sit and do spelling or math, you know <br/>\nthe real important stuff ;), I get arguments and/or tears. This <br/>\nisn&#39;t what I envisioned when I decided to educate my children at <br/>\nhome.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we just recently moved from a state with yearly testing to a <br/>\nstate that has very few restrictions, and I&#39;m thinking we should try <br/>\nunschooling. I discounted it in the past as a really nice theory, <br/>\nbut something that wouldn&#39;t work for my family. I guess I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally believe that my kids would learn what they needed by <br/>\nunschooling. After reading several personal stories and lurking on <br/>\nthis list, I now realize that my idea of what my kids should be <br/>\nlearning is a little skewed and my assumption that unschooling was <br/>\njust about education was completely off the mark. We&#39;re talking <br/>\ntotal lifestyle change here! I don&#39;t have to only stop controlling <br/>\ntheir education, I need to stop trying to control them!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my problem is how do you just suddenly let go and TRUST that <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing the right thing and the kids will learn what they need? <br/>\nWhat should I be doing with myself? Should I be right there with <br/>\nthem all day long while they&#39;re playing? Should I encourage them to <br/>\nwatch a show with me or offer to read to them or play math games? <br/>\nFor instance, they&#39;ve been cooped up in my daughter&#39;s room since <br/>\nyesterday playing barbies, only coming out occasionally to get a <br/>\nsnack or feed the pets. I can&#39;t go in there because the baby likes <br/>\nto eat all those great barbie accessories, but I feel so guilty just <br/>\nhanging out, surfing the net. I&#39;m really not sure they want me in <br/>\nthere anyway. What if they only want to play barbies and never show <br/>\nan interest in the learning they&#39;ll need to get into college some <br/>\nday (provided they want to go to college)? Please help, I feel like <br/>\nI&#39;m on the verge of an anxiety attack!
