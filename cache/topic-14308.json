I&#39;ve  <br/>\nbeen the HSC (HomeSchool Association of California) county contact  <br/>\nfor Orange County for many years and it is my experience that it is  <br/>\nextremely unlikely that you could homeschool independently in  <br/>\nCalifornia and be able to participate in any school-based activities.  <br/>\nHowever, some people get around this by enrolling in a school  <br/>\ndistrict independent study program. It doesn&#39;t always work - seems to  <br/>\nwork when the coach really wants the player, if you know what I mean.  <br/>\nIt is sometimes possible to unschool and still be enrolled in a  <br/>\npublic school isp - you have to be a little creative and figure out  <br/>\nhow to report on your child&#39;s learning, just like people do in states  <br/>\nthat have homeschooling reporting requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - if this is important to you - don&#39;t entirely despair, it might  <br/>\nbe possible. But you won&#39;t get anywhere fighting the school or CIF.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people do not find it is important enough to go through the  <br/>\nhassle - most find other sports outlets such as club play or  <br/>\nrecreational organizations such as AYSO.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":813395,"authorName":"Willa Ryan","from":"&quot;Willa Ryan&quot; &lt;willa@...&gt;","profile":"willary2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] high school sports","postDate":"1149970746","msgId":14332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwODgwMWM2OGNjYiQxZmRmZDNkMCQwNzAwMDAwYUBERVNBTEVTPg==","referencesHeader":"PDA2MTAyMDA2MTMzNi4yNjMwNC40NDhBQ0FDNjAwMDY4MzU3MDAwMDY2QzAyMjA2NDI0NDEzQ0VDN0NBQzgwODBFOUQwRTlDQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":14308,"nextInTopic":14340,"prevInTime":14331,"nextInTime":14333,"topicId":14308,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Has anyone had luck with their kids playing sports at the local high school as homeschoolers?
