We have a tiny little <br/>\nhouse and not much budget, but we&#39;ve collected a bunch of stuff at <br/>\nyardsales and dollar stores over the years. We sort of rotate <br/>\nthrough toys as Mo loses interest - sometimes we have a skateboard <br/>\nin the house, other times the sit-n-spin, others a big ball with a <br/>\nhandle for bouncing. When she was smaller we even had a small slide <br/>\nin the house for awhile. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting this as an *alternative* to him being on the <br/>\ncomputer, if that&#39;s what he wants to be doing right now.

They find <br/>\nways to get their physical needs met *and* spend plenty of time <br/>\nwatching tv and playing computer and video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; is he not loosing a part of <br/>\n&gt; his imagination (you know all this about brain damage, loosing <br/>\n&gt; interest in books.....).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of brain damage or loss of imagination <br/>\nwith my kids. They are pretty creative, imaginative people. This <br/>\nmorning my 6yo was making chains of paper dolls that were gargoyles <br/>\nand fairies - both of which she saw on cartoons, but is that so <br/>\nterrible? She could just as easily have learned about them from a <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of my kids are big fans of books, but I don&#39;t think tv or <br/>\ngames are the cause. Its more a matter of their personalities and <br/>\nthe ways they learn things. Ray prefers more interactive learning <br/>\nand entertainment, like games, and Mo is so visually oriented that <br/>\nshe&#39;d rather *see* a story than *hear* one read - and she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nread well enough to get through the kinds of stories that interest <br/>\nher.

Yesterday I spent a lot of the day playing on World of Warcraft with Simon and Linnaea. I worked on getting my newest character to level 10 and managed to hit level 11 as well. That was cool. World of Warcraft is different than the games I played with Simon when he was 3 and 4. We played a lot of Blues Clues and Tonka Construction games. He would sit on my lap and I&#39;d lean back and watch him play. It helped me to feel connected to what he was doing to be so present. When Linnaea came into the picture, when she was tiny, it was easy for me to sit with him while he was playing and hold her and bounce her and hang out with him. So I got to still to see the joy and the learning and the pleasure in what he was doing. There was only a brief time when I worried about Simon and games and that was in the leap from computer games to video games. But it quickly passed and he joyfully moved between mediums. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is so much going on in the games. So many different levels of experience. There is storytelling and art and puzzle solving and music and so many other things, and so much involvement offered to the player. One of my favorite websites aimed at younger players is the Boobahs website: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.boohbah.com/zone.html.\">http://www.boohbah.com/zone.html.</a> I can remember sitting for hours with a friend&#39;s daughter on my lap playing on the Boobah site. Neopets is great and there are some really interesting games at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.funny-games.biz/main.html\">http://www.funny-games.biz/main.html</a> that Simon and Linnaea play for ages. Line rider (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://linerider.com/play-line-rider-online)\">http://linerider.com/play-line-rider-online)</a> is another amazing site. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/arts/wingedsandals/\">http://www.abc.net.au/arts/wingedsandals/</a> is a fantastic story-telling site with games based on Greek mythology. <br/>\n<br/>\nScreen time is such a dismissive term for such an amazing way to spend some time exploring the world. It is visual and kinesthetic and audial all at once. I love playing along with Simon and Linnaea, they&#39;ve opened so many doors to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Katharine &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:anja_27_99@...\">anja_27_99@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 18 April, 2008 9:45:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] Need Advice on computer times<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Everybody,<br/>\nI am reading on this list on and of for about a year. My friend gave <br/>\nme the idea about unschooling and homeschooling and so I started to <br/>\nget some information. Let me tell you, it is not easy to understand <br/>\nthis way of life but I am getting better, I hope lol. But now I need <br/>\nan advice; my son ist 3,5 yo and all into computer games. He started <br/>\nover a year ago when he saw me play Myst, so I showed him games on <br/>\nnickjr and noggin.com. In the beginning he would play once a week, <br/>\nmaybe twice. But as he was getting better he wanted to play more and <br/>\nmore and I was getting worried about the time he was/is spending in <br/>\nfront of the computer. We still had our playtimes with his friend, <br/>\nplaytimes with me or his dad. In January his brother was born and <br/>\nduring the day I was/am not able anymore to play with him all the <br/>\ntime. He has little interested in playing by himself, he needs <br/>\nrunning and jumping and moving and with the baby I am not able to <br/>\ngive him this kind of play, at least not all the time. So he ended up <br/>\nwith the games on the computer. And I am worried, mostly because I <br/>\nthink that to much screen time at his age is not good. My friend who <br/>\nstarted me on the ideaof unschooling thinks the same and she is able <br/>\nto set time limits on TV with her 2,5 yo. I tried but it would end up <br/>\nwith fighting, and this is not something that I would like to do. Can <br/>\nI really trust my son with this, how can I do it when I myself think <br/>\nthat is not good for him. On the other hand I can see how much better <br/>\nhe is with those games but than again, is he not loosing a part of <br/>\nhis imagination (you know all this about brain damage, loosing <br/>\ninterest in books.....). I know that if he getts his needs met with <br/>\nan active play, he will not be interested in games so much, but right <br/>\nnow I am not able to do it all day long, and I am short on other <br/>\nideas (we bake and cook together, he loves to play with water and <br/>\ndirt, mixing stuff, making paint but it is nothing for 12 h a day. <br/>\nWhat can I do or at least how can I be not so worried with this. Any <br/>\nhelp would be great.<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\nsorry for my english,I am not a native speaker<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!
