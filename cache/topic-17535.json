Just an example, a mom brought candy to the park  one day, <br/>\nthis was like 3 years ago so my youngest was probably around 6.   Every child <br/>\nhad a piece and as my youngest was walking away he dropped a piece  of candy <br/>\nwrapper on the ground, he didn&#39;t know this.  One mom said &quot;you  need to pick up <br/>\nyour trash, we don&#39;t want to pollute this beautiful park etc  etc.&quot; My son <br/>\nlooked at her and I think was a bit confused but he just walked  away.  I just <br/>\nreached down and picked it up for him.  After all there  were a bunch of us <br/>\nsitting around, he wasn&#39;t the only one in the park that could  pick it up.  LOL.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway she started saying that &quot;I was not trying to get  mom to pick up the <br/>\ntrash, I was trying to get the child to pick up the  trash&quot;.  All I said was <br/>\n&quot;so really you were not wanting the trash picked up  to not pollute the park as <br/>\nyou stated, you were trying to *teach* my child a  lesson.&quot;  She got the hint <br/>\nand was quiet.  LOL.<br/>\n <br/>\nI might have asked my MIL what she really wanted, &quot;do  you really want help <br/>\nwith your chair, if you do I am more than willing to help  you with your chair, <br/>\nI am just sitting here and then my daughter can enjoy the  time she has hear <br/>\nand play with the others, we so enjoy coming here and enjoy  the company.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\nThat might have diffused the situation.  So you  wouldn&#39;t get into it with <br/>\nher at all.  Where you see them frequently maybe  it would be easier to see her <br/>\nwhen there are not a lot of other adults  around.  I think sometimes older <br/>\npeople feel a need to &quot;take control&quot; and  &quot;be right&quot; in front of others.  Like <br/>\nsome pack mentality, have to stay on  top.<br/>\n <br/>\nAlso talk with your daughter at home, let her express her feelings and her  <br/>\nwants and needs in a situation like that.  Maybe roll play some other ways  of <br/>\ncommunicating.<br/>\nJust a thought,<br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17527,"nextTopicId":17541}}
