I&#39;d give him 2 sprays in the mouth of the sour spray and he was far less oral (mouthing things) for a couple of hours.  THe speech therapist said that it would stimulate his mouth so he would not feel the need to but things in his mouth.  Eventually he grew out of mouthing things.  Since then I have used this on other children who had oral tendencies and it has worked on every child I used it on.  It is spray candy, so if you use this technique on a child, you may want to brush his teeth a little more often than you would ordinarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnn <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jamie&quot; &lt;jamielsowers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Guys!<br/>\n&gt;  My son is 4 and has had a habit of fixing his clothes over and over and now he has started licking and biting his fingers(compulsively?)for about 2 weeks.

I still have the problem and I am 30! It did stop for a period of time, then came back. I have no recollection of what was going on in my life at the time to examine why it may have stopped:( I am not certain why but its just this feeling like I can&#39;t handle the way my hands feel (irked) sometimes and licking makes it feel better or more under control. I also had issues with wearing socks and jeans because I couldn&#39;t handle the way they felt. I grew out of that for the most part but jeans still bug me a little or on certain occasions. My mom used to keep a bottle of lotion around for me and that used to &#39;irk&#39; me as well but eventually I found that this served as a good replacement sometimes, maybe give it a try until its resolved so germs are not an issue.<br/>\nAnyway hope to hear more on this topic.<br/>\nChristina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":139136574,"authorName":"Jeanette","from":"Jeanette &lt;jeanettec_99@...&gt;","profile":"jeanettec_99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] compulsively licking fingers","postDate":"1289560894","msgId":45299,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5OTg1LjkzMDI4LnFtQHdlYjM2MTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":45297,"nextInTopic":45302,"prevInTime":45298,"nextInTime":45300,"topicId":45297,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my son was 4 he went through a major spitting stage.

An occupational therapist suggested some mouth activities.....blowing bubbles, blowing on toy flutes or blowers (there are tons of them out there!!!!), chewing crunchy food like pretzels, chewing huge gumballs, drinking from straws, etc. We bought our son a toy flute that he played with for several hours....the spitting (all over everything,playing with his spit, letting drip down his chin) all stopped. A few months later he started it again and I got the flute back out...went away again and he has never done it again. I can&#39;t remember what the OT called this, but it had to do with sensory problems.
