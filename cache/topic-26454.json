Most of our  <br/>\nkids have or could have labels, so I can imagine what it must look  <br/>\nlike in your house. It was very hard to deschool in our house, not  <br/>\njust because of me, but because the kids were already so brainwashed  <br/>\ninto believing what the school said. What truly helped me was telling  <br/>\nmyself that my kids needed me now, more than ever, to let them heal.  <br/>\nThere have been serious injuries to their spirit and their mind, and  <br/>\nit took my twelve yo (who was ten when we started) almost two years  <br/>\nto deschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have to do portfolios, so I&#39;m lucky there. But I seem to  <br/>\ntranslate naturally in my head to keep my family off my back.  When I  <br/>\nfirst started, I used &#39;notebook&#39; on my computer. Then try to  <br/>\ncategorize. For example, last night and today we played with lego&#39;s  <br/>\nmost of the time. As Breanna was snapping another layer onto her  <br/>\nmontage (she makes patterns with the blocks and colors) I was amazed  <br/>\nat how she was figuring ratio&#39;s, how many small blocks to fill a  <br/>\nspace, how she was making patterns, how she was balancing color,  <br/>\nthere were several subjects that we could define this really cool  <br/>\nactivity under. *If* I was trying to track for my portfolio (I assume  <br/>\nthat you have to do it for legal reasons) I would be quick to write  <br/>\nit down. The best thing for ME has been to stop keeping track. Of  <br/>\ncourse, it probably did help me keep my nagging under control in the  <br/>\nbeginning, because I could see how they were engaged every day with  <br/>\nreally cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t worry about the portfolio, when do you have to show it  <br/>\nto someone? Is it yearly? It would be at the end of the school year,  <br/>\nyes? So don&#39;t worry about having masterpieces or signs of genius,  <br/>\nnumber one, keep everything, number two, and then pick out some  <br/>\nfavorites.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, lost track of where I was going with this, really cool  <br/>\nconstruction trucks in front of our house! Have a nice day....<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sep 24, 2007, at 9:04 AM, Shannon wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi!
