There are many groups with people new to<br/>\nhomeschooling, or new to the area, who haven&#39;t created connections<br/>\nwith other homeschoolers. So, last month I put together a list of<br/>\nweekly activities that worked for me and our friends, and posted it<br/>\naround to many of the local groups and invited all to join us. It has<br/>\ngrown to now include weekly park days, and partnering with the library<br/>\nfor space to meet weekly for Fun Clubs and Game Days. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe activities include area parks, state parks, bike days, hiking,<br/>\nmuseum outings, picnicking, and weekend family events such as camping,<br/>\nfestivals, parades, gem shows, etc. There is no age restriction for<br/>\nparticipation, all family members are welcome. We are focused on fun<br/>\nand connecting with others. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe template for our Fun Clubs is &quot;Do What You Love! Share What You<br/>\nLove!&quot; Clubs will be led by adults or kids about their passions. Here<br/>\nare some ideas to start brainstorming, what do you and your kids<br/>\nLOVE?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnime, art/drawing Club<br/>\nATC-Artist Trading Cards Club<br/>\nAstronomy Club<br/>\nBook Club<br/>\nCamera Club<br/>\nChess Club<br/>\nCooking Club<br/>\nDrama Club/skits<br/>\nEarth Connections-Ecology Club<br/>\nEntrepreneurs Club<br/>\nGem-Mineral Club<br/>\nGuitar Club<br/>\nInventions Club<br/>\nJewelry Making Club<br/>\nKnitting Club<br/>\nLego Club<br/>\nMovie Making Club<br/>\nPoetry Club<br/>\nRobot Club<br/>\nScience Experiment Club<br/>\nScrapbooking Club<br/>\nSewing Club<br/>\nSign Language Club<br/>\nStock Market Club<br/>\nTelescopes and the Night Sky<br/>\nWorld Travel Club<br/>\nVideo Game Club<br/>\nYoga<br/>\nYu-Gi-Oh!
