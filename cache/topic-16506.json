If they are, that&#39;s ok,<br/>\nyou will probably still find useful ideas here. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say she has to go over concepts what exactly do you mean?   Can<br/>\nyou give an example from her childhood? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she played with trucks did she have to drive them and drive them<br/>\nbefore she could drive them? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n   <br/>\n***Over the years we have just done math from &quot;daily life.&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you thinking of it as math?  <br/>\n<br/>\n***My daughter wanted to start doing math from a book.

What conversations did you have with your<br/>\ndaughter when she asked for a book for math?   Why did she think a text<br/>\nbook would be the best way to learn math?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have to tell you, if I picked up a Saxon 8/7 I&#39;d find it hard, too.<br/>\nThose books are bland and repetitive and awful.  That seems the fastest<br/>\npossible way to kill interest.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling that you weren&#39;t always unschooling.   Not in the way we<br/>\ntalk about unschooling here.  That&#39;s not an accusation.   When people say<br/>\nthey have always unschooled we get a picture in our head but my picture<br/>\ngets fuzzy when you talk about concepts and Saxon.&lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s a hard<br/>\nconcept for me.   And we need to know what you want from us.

All people, kids in public school, kids in private<br/>\nschool, kids in home schools,  unschoolers and adults will at once be<br/>\nahead of and behind others in some areas or abilities.   I am way ahead<br/>\nof my friend Ellen in vegetable canning.  I am way behind my friend Sue<br/>\nin birch bark canoe building.   I would find out where she got the idea<br/>\nthat a specific kind of learning from a book would be a better way to<br/>\nlearn.

It has very<br/>\nlittle to do with what any of us does in real life.  Very few people<br/>\nuse &quot;math&quot; the way it was taught in high school (let alone elementary<br/>\nschool).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she need to &quot;finish high school?&quot;  Is college her goal?  Is it<br/>\nher goal right now?  Does she need to &quot;finish&quot; high school when she is<br/>\n13 or even 18?  We have the arbitrary time limits that are imposed by<br/>\n&quot;the system&quot; that don&#39;t correlate to anything that is real.  We assume<br/>\nthat a child is an &quot;adult&quot; when they are 18.  that they are mature<br/>\nenough to drink when they are 21.  Senior citizens are considered<br/>\npeople who are 50 (or 55) or older and in many companies mandatory<br/>\nretirement is 72.  Do any of those ages have anything to do at all<br/>\nwith a person&#39;s ability or understanding?  No.  My father is 74 and is<br/>\nsharp as a tack.  Dan&#39;s dad is 86 and has just started to slow down<br/>\n(he&#39;s decided that it might not be a good idea for him to go<br/>\nmotorcycle riding in the mountains on his own anymore!)  I have<br/>\nfriends who are in their 30&#39;s yet I wouldn&#39;t trust them to make a<br/>\nmature decision if their lives depended on it (and in the past it<br/>\nhas!)  Yet I know other people who are under 18 who have the maturity<br/>\nand understanding of several lifetimes who I would entrust my life to<br/>\nif needed!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter doesn&#39;t need to &quot;finish&quot; high school anytime soon.<br/>\nShe&#39;s *only* 13.  that&#39;s still very young.  When your daughter has the<br/>\nneed for the understanding of mathematics it will work itself out for<br/>\nher.  It seems like the math workbooks are only causing her more<br/>\nstress.  Get her a calculator and move past this back into joyful<br/>\nliving!  Assure her that arithmetic has very little to do with the<br/>\nunderstanding of mathematics. I bet she understands math better than<br/>\nshe thinks she does.
