I know it probably<br/>\nseems like a little thing, just a baby step, especially to those of<br/>\nyou who have been unschooling for years, but I was so happy about<br/>\nthis! It was great to interact with the kids in this way, to validate<br/>\ntheir ideas, to empower them and take them seriously, and treat their<br/>\nwishes with utmost care.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday we got home late from grocery shopping and as we were pulling<br/>\nin the driveway my daughter said, &quot;Mom, I want to help you unload the<br/>\ngroceries.&quot; I laughed and said, &quot;You just want to unpack the honey we<br/>\nbought!&quot; (She&#39;d been diligent about making sure we bought honey and<br/>\nmentioned wanting some when we got home.) She said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t care<br/>\nabout the honey, really.&quot; So I replied jokingly, &quot;Ah, you&#39;re not<br/>\nsleepy and want something to do.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;Nope. You look<br/>\ntired and I just want to help, that&#39;s all.&quot; (A year ago I would have<br/>\ninsisted she go straight to bed and probably thought she was just<br/>\nusing stall tactics.) But I went with it and said I&#39;d love to have her<br/>\nhelp if she wanted to do that. After I carried DS to bed (he&#39;d fallen<br/>\nasleep in the car) she helped me unload every single bag from the car<br/>\n(there were a lot) and then we sorted the food together and she took<br/>\ncharge of putting all the frozen stuff away. It was actually fun to do<br/>\nit together, I really enjoyed having this time with her and I think<br/>\nshe enjoyed it to - she felt helpful and appreciated. Of course, I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t expect her to any of this (and I wouldn&#39;t have even asked). As<br/>\nsoon as the last bag was empty she gave me a hug and said &quot;good night<br/>\nmom!&quot; and went to bed. I just stood there for a few minutes afterwards<br/>\nwith a big stupid, happy grin on my face and thought about what an<br/>\namazing kid she is. I also realized that it *shouldn&#39;t* be surprising<br/>\nto me, but coming from a conventional mindset it was wonderfully<br/>\nrefreshing to break away from that mold and trust her intentions and<br/>\nenjoy the moment, to find joy in putting the groceries away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen yesterday the kids asked if we could take a walk to our<br/>\nneighborhood creek. My first inclination was to say no - I had just<br/>\nstarted a rather complicated project, my mind was preoccupied and I<br/>\nfelt pushed for time. Then two of those mantras came zooming into my<br/>\nhead (find a way to say yes and the relationship is what matters).<br/>\nThey clearly wanted this experience I should be honored to share it<br/>\nwith them. I realized that there was nothing happening that I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nwalk away from and come back to later, and that my kids were asking<br/>\nfor my attention right now and they were certainly more important than<br/>\nthe project I was working on. So I told them it was great idea and to<br/>\ngive me just 5 minutes to put some stuff away.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I came into the hallway I found my son waiting at the door with a<br/>\nbackpack full of stuff and it looked pretty heavy. He said that he&#39;d<br/>\npacked a blanket, a bottle of juice, 3 cups, some books, and a<br/>\nnotebook for drawing. I had the urge to tell him &quot;no&quot; about the juice<br/>\nand to talk him out of taking the heavy books, for no real reason - my<br/>\nobjections totally fell apart when I examined them more closely. Why<br/>\nhas my first instinct been to say &quot;no&quot;? Anyways, it occurred to me<br/>\nthat these things were clearly part of his plan for spending time at<br/>\nthe creek, he felt they added something important to his adventure,<br/>\nand it was very thoughtful of him to anticipate what our needs might<br/>\nbe and plan accordingly. (I find myself actually having these<br/>\nconversations in my head lately but at least they&#39;re helping me from<br/>\nblurting out the first thing that comes to mind.) He also had the dogs<br/>\nhooked up to their leashes. I wasn&#39;t planning to take the dogs but<br/>\nthere really wasn&#39;t any reason not to and he wanted to walk them, so<br/>\nout the door we went. We had a lovely walk and enjoyed a leisurely<br/>\ntime at the creek, where DS spread out the blanket and kept us<br/>\nhydrated and refreshed with juice. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the way back he wanted to run so he asked if I would carry the<br/>\nbackpack and take the dogs. I could literally hear the words of my<br/>\nprevious mentality (echoing the words of my mother) saying, &quot;It was<br/>\nyour choice to bring the dogs and you insisted on carrying that<br/>\nbackpack, so that&#39;s what you need to do.&quot; Fortunately I didn&#39;t say<br/>\nthat! Instead I held out my hands and he handed me everything. As I<br/>\nwatched him run ahead in that excited, joyous way children do, I felt<br/>\nthis huge weight lift off me. In my mind&#39;s eye I could picture those<br/>\nawful words floating above me like a banner and then they just cracked<br/>\nand dissipated into little tiny specks until they were totally gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoments like these just make me want them more, to do things better<br/>\neach day.
