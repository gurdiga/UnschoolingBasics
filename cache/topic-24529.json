We do make some stuff at home but<br/>\nI&#39;ve slowly drifted away from that over the years as our lives got<br/>\nbusier - I&#39;m going back to baking more which will help. We do use<br/>\nbrown rice, beans, and lentils but I&#39;ve realized they could all be<br/>\nmade more frequently, especially since they are enjoyed so. Last night<br/>\nI made the kids Mud Soup (black bean base) which they love (and it&#39;s<br/>\nso simple to make). I&#39;m wondering why I haven&#39;t made it more often,<br/>\nbut that will change. We were making trips to Whole Foods every few<br/>\nmonths to stock up but with gas prices right now we wouldn&#39;t be saving<br/>\nmuch. Sometimes it&#39;s just fun to go shopping at Whole Foods, though<br/>\nand it&#39;s neat day trip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone who has responded to my request for suggestions &<br/>\nadvice. The past two weekends (when we do our grocery shopping) I&#39;ve<br/>\nmade a point to buy more of their favorite foods. Since we ran out of<br/>\ntheir soy ice cream halfway through last week I made sure to buy<br/>\ndouble this week. They liked the cookies & brownies we made Thursday,<br/>\nso I stocked up on the ingredients. I&#39;ve talked to 2 of my local<br/>\ngrocery stores to see if they can start to carry (or at least order<br/>\nfor me) a few of their favorite products, like soy yogurt and rice<br/>\n&quot;graham&quot; crackers. I&#39;m willing to buy a case at a time if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis experience has also given me a chance to reflect on another<br/>\nthread from several months ago about making errands and similar things<br/>\nenjoyable for kids, such as grocery shopping. It&#39;s what would normally<br/>\nbe considered a tedious, boring task, but each week I&#39;ve been finding<br/>\na few more small ways to make it enjoyable for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Susan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24511,"nextTopicId":24318}}
