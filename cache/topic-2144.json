Uh-uh. Not at all. If you have work where you only do what someone says and they squash down your ideas, you&#39;re not doing anything good in the world by staying! Yucko.<br/>\nMy work is also my creativity. I am encouraged to voice my ideas and opinions and use my creative side, I am in charge of when and where I work and for how long. School never gave me that freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kind of views like the above, and about school being like work, are VERY schoolish points of view and not shared by this gal. Only those that still have their school glasses on would think like that. <br/>\nIt&#39;s pervasive, and unhealthy and not at all truthful.<br/>\nYou CAN choose your life.
