My kids get frustrated when we are doing something <br/>\nthat requires math skills and they don&#39;t know how to do it (like the <br/>\nwhole concept of multiplication instead of adding) but not <br/>\nfrustrated enough that they ask &quot;I want to learn how to....&quot;.  I <br/>\nhave chalked it up to their ages (11 and 8) and that they are just <br/>\nnot old enough to understand that it is helpful to figure things out <br/>\nwhen you have a mathematical procedure to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight on this?
