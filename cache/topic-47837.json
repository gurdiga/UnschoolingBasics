I have an 18yo and a 10yo - the elder went through school and home-ed before we wised up and got him out of school, the younger never had to deal with anything but unschooling.

They get to dive in and spend hours and hours reading, or drawing comics, or playing video games, or skateboarding, or building with legos, or watching movies.... It&#39;s exciting to watch and see just how much they pull out of whatever they&#39;re doing Because they&#39;re doing what they&#39;ve chosen to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; because he is such a skilled reader, he understands sarcasm and irony already.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m going to quibble ;) It&#39;s just as likely the same brain development which lets him understand sarcasm and irony contributes to his being a skilled reader. The skills needed to read fluently are diverse and somewhat idiosyncratic (like my spelling... is that how that&#39;s spelled?). The &quot;normal&quot; range for learning to read is something like 4-14 - no kidding! So while some 7yos will be very skilled readers, some kids won&#39;t read much of anything until they&#39;re teens - no matter what you do. So if your 3yo isn&#39;t an early reader, don&#39;t fret, he&#39;ll have a different set of genes and learn when he&#39;s ready, too - and in any case he&#39;ll be learning so much in so many ways reading will get to be just one more skill, like riding a bike. Ray learned to ride a bike at 4. Mo&#39;s 10 and doesn&#39;t ride yet. She read at 4, he read closer to 8. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;right now, he is addicted to the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books by R. A. Montgomery<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n <br/>\nIf he likes computer games, too, I&#39;d check out some of the longer, more complex games like... er, I&#39;m blanking. Fable. Myst. Elder Scrolls. In video games he might like something like God of War or Shadow of the Collossus or Okami. <br/>\n<br/>\nHappy unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":12299440,"authorName":"amari28may","from":"&quot;amari28may&quot; &lt;juniorburchall@...&gt;","profile":"amari28may","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"unschooling makes sense.","postDate":"1326821707","msgId":47837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmNGJnYis1MW5lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":47840,"prevInTime":47836,"nextInTime":47838,"topicId":47837,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"howdy, y all! we ve been doing unschooling w/ our two boys (aged 7 and) since 2011...and we freakin LOVE it! our first-born was getting bored with grade 1 and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-796208262\">howdy, y&#39;all!<br/>\n<br/>\nwe&#39;ve been doing unschooling w/ our two boys (aged 7 and) since 2011...and we freakin&#39; LOVE it!<br/>\n<br/>\nour first-born was getting bored with grade 1 and said as much to anyone who would listen (when he was in kindergarten, he was reading comfortably at grade 6 level), even though his teacher was very attentive and gave him &#39;advanced&#39; work. <br/>\n<br/>\nwe took him out, we read EVERYTHING that we could get our hands on about unschooling/ life learning...and jumped in! the boys are now enjoying themselves and the stress that we weren&#39;t even aware that we had (around getting them to school on time, completing hwk, etc.) simply vanished.<br/>\n<br/>\nour oldest now spends at least five hours per day, EVERY DAY, reading on his own. he also does math problems using fractions and percentages (which i throw out to him while we are walking to basketball or in the woods), in his head. nothing is written down.<br/>\n<br/>\nbecause he is such a skilled reader, he understands sarcasm and irony already. and our conversations about the books that he is reading (right now, he is addicted to the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books by R.
