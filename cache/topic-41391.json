I can&#39;t, but I wish I could. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been through some serious episodes of hell. Most of which I could have avoided if I&#39;d been better informed and if I hadn&#39;t had to learn through the school of hard knocks. I believe in the power of education and honesty and logical consequences - on the logic that a small bump, early on, saves you a hard fall later on. Makes you more aware. <br/>\n <br/>\nAgain, I&#39;m VERY sorry you went through all that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 9/14/09, Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: Karen Swanay &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:luvbullbreeds@...\">luvbullbreeds@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [unschoolingbasics] (Was) Daughter&#39;s weight gain (Now) Who has suffered the most?
