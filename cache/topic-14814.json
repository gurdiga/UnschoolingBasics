Perhaps it has to do with issues I have had<br/>\nwith snakes and rats (although lizards are cool I coul do lizards).<br/>\nWhen I was a child we had a pond down by my grandparents house.  My<br/>\ngrandmother told me to go down and tell my uncle (who was on the pond<br/>\nfishing) to come in for dinner.  When I went down to the water&#39;s edge<br/>\nI looked down and my foot was right beside a freshly hatched nest of<br/>\nbaby corral snakes!!  I truly think my heart stopped beating!  And<br/>\nthen a few years ago when Dan and I were going through the divorce I<br/>\nwas renting a small house which was infested with rats.  They were<br/>\ncrawling through the walls.  The landlord refused to do anything about<br/>\nit.  I tried several different attempts to get rid of them to little<br/>\navail.  So when I moved out I made an anonymous call to the health<br/>\ninspector.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpiders though are cool.  I have a small house spider that lives in my<br/>\nkitchen window.  Interestingly I have had such a spider (sometimes a<br/>\nsmall jumping spider) that has lived in my kitchen windows since oh,<br/>\nprobably 1985 or 86!  I make a deal with them.  They don&#39;t jump on me<br/>\nand I won&#39;t smoosh them.  So far so good.  In fact one of my spiders<br/>\nused to come out and sit on the edge of my African violets when I<br/>\nwould do the dishes.  She was always curious as to what I was doing.<br/>\nI talked to her and like to think she would talk back if she could.<br/>\nShe was my Charlotte.  I figure if there is a spider living in the<br/>\nhouse then that means there are enough small enough bugs to satisfy<br/>\ntheir tastes.  I have been known to move egg sacks outside though to<br/>\nkeep an infestation from growing.  And we sometimes get the loveliest<br/>\norb weavers building nests around the house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":253937257,"authorName":"April Morris","from":"&quot;April Morris&quot; &lt;klkb624@...&gt;","profile":"klkb624","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] We Have A Tarantula In The House","postDate":"1150846501","msgId":14820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFlMjZhNTcxMDYwNjIwMTYzNW4xNTVmNjc4MGgzMGEwNjQxNmVkZTFkMDFlQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwNjIwMjAyMDM2LjE5NjgyLnFtYWlsQHdlYjM0MTExLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGU3OWY2ZSsxMDA4dUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JIDwyMDA2MDYyMDIwMjAzNi4xOTY4Mi5xbWFpbEB3ZWIzNDExMS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":14817,"nextInTopic":14821,"prevInTime":14819,"nextInTime":14821,"topicId":14814,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m with you on that one!
