Her difficulites in school drove me to find the &quot;answer&quot; <br/>\nand I eventually came to homeschooling and unschooling (which I had <br/>\nnever heard of 3 or 4 years ago).

Have you read any books etc about unschooling? The book <br/>\nthat first that &quot;did it&quot; for me was &quot;Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden <br/>\nCurriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot; by John Taylor Gatto&quot;.   Others <br/>\nare &quot;Guerrilla Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With <br/>\nor Without School&quot; By Grace Llewellyn and &quot;The Teenage Liberation <br/>\nHandbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education&quot; By <br/>\nGrace Llewellyn.  Anything by John Holt (Learning All The Time, How <br/>\nChildren Learn, How Children Fail, Teach your own etc).<br/>\n&quot;Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life&quot; by Rue Kream is <br/>\nwonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some great websites as well (hopefully someone can post <br/>\nthem quicker than I can, I can&#39;t find my list!).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow old is your son?  How long has he been out of school?   He needs <br/>\nto deschool.   The common &quot;rule&quot; is one month of deschooling for <br/>\nevery year he was in school.   (I included K and day care!).    Let <br/>\nhim heal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely a paradigm shift.  You will find YOU need to deschool <br/>\neven more than your child, to change the way you look at learning.   <br/>\nBefore I started reading and understanding, I, too, thought that my <br/>\ndd had to fit into the way the schools were &quot;teaching&quot;.   What I know <br/>\nnow is that she is not &quot;broken&quot; and does not need to be &quot;fixed&quot;!<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231323296,"authorName":"Tina","from":"&quot;Tina&quot; &lt;fae_dragonfly@...&gt;","profile":"fae_dragonfly","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Getting started from a newbie...","postDate":"1169773769","msgId":21051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVwYmtjOStxNjJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":21084,"prevInTime":21050,"nextInTime":21052,"topicId":21051,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone!
