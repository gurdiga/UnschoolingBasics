There were some great responses from others too, I am just reposting mine because that is easy for me &lt;g&gt;!  If you are on the Yahoo UnschoolingDiscussion group or want to join it, in the files section at the website there is a folder titled CPS contacts that has some great info that helped me when I was dealing with them.  Good luck.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J.  from NM   (reposts follow)<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thanx for your reply:) Your daughter does seem alot like mine:) I read the  <br/>\narticle from Kathy Ward &quot;Unschooling with ADD&quot; and totally agree with it. It <br/>\nwas  amazing. I have decided to unschool (deschool first) and was wondering what <br/>\ndo  you say when people (more so relatives) ask what your doing? And also <br/>\nwhen my  son is asked and he says,&quot;I play video games and ride my bike, etc...&quot; I <br/>\nhave  DYFS (CPS) coming to meet with me tommorrow because of my other son <br/>\n(who is  autistic) who has been running off(out of the house and then downtown) <br/>\nfor the  last month or two. I know HS&#39;ing is legal ,but what about  <br/>\nde-schooling/unschooling? a little nervous...should I post these  questions/concerns <br/>\nseperate?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanx for sharing your experience.....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this was my (Katy J.) response:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hello, I have been there, done that with CPS, except mine was because someone turned me in for my unschooling and sorta messy house.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to know your state laws.  If you need a curriculum Sandra Dodd&#39;s website has a great one.  It is general and unschooly, but when I gave it to my CPS officer she was kind of blown away by it!  I copied the second link (below) to Word, then I just changed the name of course, to my son&#39;s name, and changed the specific things to things that we actually have done and resources that are in my area.  My state doesn&#39;t require a curriculum, or much of anything, and I made sure that I let my CPS officer know that I knew that, and as it turned out I knew more of the homeschooling regulations than she did.  I gave her a copy of the regulations off of the internet for her info &lt;g&gt;.  Being confident that you are doing all that is required by your state goes a long way, and as I was reminded on another list when I was worried about my visit, unschooling IS homeschooling.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t mention unschooling, just say homeschooling and use a loose, general curriculum, if you need it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/acme1&lt;http://sandradodd.com/acme1&gt;&lt;http://sandradodd.com/acme1&lt;http://sandradodd.com/acme1&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&lt;http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&gt;&lt;http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&lt;http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, that is so stressful, I know.  <br/>\nKaty J. in NM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nand <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And also when my  son is asked and he says,&quot;I play video games and ride my bike, etc...&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this, you can prompt him, &quot;remember when we saw the wolves at the zoo....&quot;, or &quot;Remember those great rocks we saw (or picked up) on our nature walk the other day?&quot; etc.  Then you could let the CPS officer know that you are collecting rocks to later identify their composition or some such thing.   <br/>\nHave you ever heard or experienced public schooled kids being asked &quot;what did you learn today?&quot;  The answers are usually along the lines of &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t remember&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;Nothing.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty J. in NM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Brenda&lt;mailto:yourhealthyfamily@...&gt; <br/>\n  To: unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com&lt;mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 14, 2005 2:06 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] Re: CPS, CYFD, DYFS, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m sorry but I looked for the start of this message and can&#39;t find it <br/>\n  anywhere :((  Can you please tell me where it is or repost it because I <br/>\n  have my dumb X calling CYS on me all the time and would really like all <br/>\n  the info in this area that I can get!

If you need a curriculum Sandra Dodd&#39;s website has a great one.  It is general and unschooly, but when I gave it to my CPS officer she was kind of blown away by it!  I copied the second link (below) to Word, then I just changed the name of course, to my son&#39;s name, and changed the specific things to things that we actually have done and resources that are in my area.  My state doesn&#39;t require a curriculum, or much of anything, and I made sure that I let my CPS officer know that I knew that, and as it turned out I knew more of the homeschooling regulations than she did.  I gave her a copy of the regulations off of the internet for her info &lt;g&gt;.  Being confident that you are doing all that is required by your state goes a long way, and as I was reminded on another list when I was worried about my visit, unschooling IS homeschooling.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t mention unschooling, just say homeschooling and use a loose, general curriculum, if you need it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/acme1&lt;http://sandradodd.com/acme1\">http://sandradodd.com/acme1&lt;http://sandradodd.com/acme1</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&lt;http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html\">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html&lt;http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, that is so stressful, I know.  <br/>\nKaty J. in NM<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7116,"nextTopicId":7072}}
