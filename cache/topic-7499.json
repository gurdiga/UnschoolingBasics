I feel like I<br/>\nreally need that time because I don&#39;t usually get it during the day. <br/>\nAt this point in my kids lives they still want me to play with them or<br/>\njust sit with them while they are watching tv or whatever.  So I feel<br/>\nif I stop with the bedtime then I will lose my quiet, alone time.  Is<br/>\nthat a selfish reason?  How can there be a balance?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nThey&#39;re still *really* little. I can&#39;t imagine that they&#39;re even able to stay up too late! But <br/>\nI have two big sleepers, so I&#39;m always amazed at how late other kids can keep going! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI think it&#39;s much more important that they learn to give you space when you need it than to set<br/>\nup arbitrary bedtimes in order to get it. But they are really little! I&#39;ll use my Aunt Celie&#39;s <br/>\nadvice: enjoy it while you got it &#39;cause you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone!<br/>\n <br/>\nENJOY the time you play with them and sit with them while they watch tv! It won&#39;t last forever!<br/>\nAnd you WILL miss it when they move on to bigger and better things! <br/>\n <br/>\nI understand the need to have alone time. I get mine mostly in the mornings---no one&#39;s awake at <br/>\n6:30 but me & the dogs! &lt;G&gt; You may need to alter your scheduled alone time! &lt;g&gt; But you can <br/>\nalso explain to them how you need some quiet time in the evenings. They may want to just fall <br/>\nasleep in your arms as you watch tv or read. But again---they are sooo little! I bet with a <br/>\nlittle warm milk (or nursing), a bath, and a few books or songs, they would be asleep anyway <br/>\nwithin 1/2 hour!<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re NOT saying that such young children should be awake until you retire @ midnight! But you <br/>\n*can* make bedtime a pleasant time FOR them---something they look forward to---even if that <br/>\nmeans you get 1/2 hour less time for yourself alone. <br/>\n <br/>\nAre they not tired at the end of the day? Do they *want* to stay up? Do they fight sleep? Do <br/>\n*you* understand that they&#39;ll sleep when they&#39;re tired? Won&#39;t they???<br/>\n~Kelly Kelly LovejoyConference CoordinatorLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7358,"nextTopicId":7408}}
