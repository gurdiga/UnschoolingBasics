It&#39;s nearly impossible to live a life and not do math. We *live* math every day, in every moment. As I&#39;m sitting here, I see two windows in front of me. Each of those windows has a blind, and pulled halfway, I can see 19 slats on each. I have one computer screen in front of me, and the ratio of my screen size to my firefox window size is about 1:.75. I had to stop to count the slats, but by being here, sitting here and having open eyes and a fully functioning brain, I already *knew* that. Our brain takes in so much, all the time!<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, doing math is really just putting what you already know down in words and symbols. It&#39;s using a specific language to express the *idea* of math. Unfortunately, schools have caused people to believe that math IS the symbols, which couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Unschooling allows kids the time and space to take in all of this beautiful math, all around us, in their own way. They are LIVING math, by being alive, and being allowed the time to process what they live. It all comes together, eventually, what they live and the language used to express it. We don&#39;t have to rush the language part, the abstract portion of it. Just be alive. Do stuff. Take time to just BE, and breathe, and dream. Watch the dust motes in a sunbeam - the number of them, how they play around each other. It can make music, if you let it! That&#39;s ALL math. You don&#39;t have to count the dust particles - just watch them, your brain will KNOW how many there are. You don&#39;t have to access the part of your brain that knows, to benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich makes me think of this video, which makes me very happy:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/6428069\">http://vimeo.com/6428069</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI know your daughters were asking for help with the language, specifically, and I think a lot of the games and books recommended will help. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t support them in this - just remember, they already KNOW. Keep it fun! And light! And if they&#39;re not ready for any part of the language, writey-downy stuff, it doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t know math, it means they need to grow a little more, live a little longer.

I like that the language of the units doesn&#39;t talk down to the learner, but is still understandable. They are geared to young adults and above, yet they assume no prior knowledge. Catering for life-long learners, these courses also start with a pre-test so that you&#39;re daughters can decide for themselves where they would like to put their efforts. Most importantly (for me) there is the acknowledgement that the learner is just wanting to get this done to get on with other more interesting stuff.<br/>\nThis is just one free bridging course that I found online, there are many more. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/numeracy/mums.html\">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/numeracy/mums.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree that &quot;The Number Devil&quot; is a great book.
