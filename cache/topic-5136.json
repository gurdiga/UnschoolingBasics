She needs help to remember and keep up with <br/>\n  all the stuff she chooses to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  She asks me to make her a list the night before to help her stay on task the <br/>\n  next day.  For example, she might forget to medicate her bunny who is <br/>\n  fighting ear mites and she would feel badly about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Of course, this is also the kid that has asked for a full curriculum after 6 <br/>\n  years of radical unschooling and is having a ball with it.  Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Julie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: &quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n  To: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\n  Sent: Friday, March 11, 2005 3:47 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [unschoolingbasics] demanding structure? was help!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;some children demand structure.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n  &gt;<br/>\n  &gt; People post this idea quite a lot.
