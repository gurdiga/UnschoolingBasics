Once","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-212456694\">Hello,<br/>\nOur family sleeping arrangements have varied since the children were born.  After our first son was born he slept in the big bed with me and DH.  Once our second son was born we split into two rooms, a parent and a child in each.  Except for a couple of short periods of time when we tried having the whole family in one room (with a couple of beds pushed together to make one big bed- but no one slept well so we resumed the old arrangement) we&#39;ve mostly been split into two rooms with one parent and one child each.  For the most part this has been a comfortable arrangement for all of and there has been no pressing reason to change it. My children are now 10 and 12! <br/>\nMy 10 yr old has recently expressed interest in moving into his own room soon, and would like his older brother to share that room, however my 12 yr old is still feeling he wants to sleep with a parent. <br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t bother me or my husband if he sleeps with us. I have never pushed my kids to do things (giving up bottles, toilet training, etc..,) but rather I always went with the idea that when the time was right and they were ready, these things would happen naturally and easily.  So far that philosophy has worked for our kids. Recently however, I have found myself wondering if I shouldn&#39;t be encouraging my older son to have his own room too.  I&#39;ve mentioned it gently once or twice in the past couple of years but he has resisted and I haven&#39;t wanted to make a big issue of it because i feel that if he has some need for the security of sleeping with a parent, then I want to honor that. He is otherwise very well-adjusted and independent.  We&#39;ve been unschooling all along except for a year of kindergarten for my oldest before I made the decision to keep him home. <br/>\nDoes anyone have any input?  Should I allow the co-sleeping to continue until HE asks to have his own room (with or without my other ds)? Or should I be gently encouraging him to also consider sharing a room with his brother or having his own room? <br/>\nThanks so much in advance for your response.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43312,"nextTopicId":43321}}
