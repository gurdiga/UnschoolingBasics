I&#39;m realizing more and more as I read <br/>\npeople&#39;s suggestions that this only became a problem for me during <br/>\npregnancy. I seem to have pretty short circuit&#39;s now and need a lot <br/>\nmore time to sleep, sit or lie down, not have pressures around me. <br/>\nNausea takes a lot of energy and ability to think as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nDs does play video games and watch movies, but he usually wants me to <br/>\nparticipate -- I&#39;m either playing the game with him or answering <br/>\nquestions/responding during movies. He hardly ever watches TV <br/>\nanymore, because all of the kid&#39;s shows are in French, German or <br/>\nItalian. <br/>\n<br/>\nWeekends go really well for me, because my husband is usually home <br/>\nand taking over playing with ds -- I think I need to nurture myself <br/>\nbetter and/or get a babysitter during the week. I like the babysitter <br/>\nidea, because we can take time to get to know one person so that he <br/>\nfeels comfortable with her and she can give him all of her attention. <br/>\nFor so many reasons (that he communicates to me in many ways), I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think I&#39;ll find any sort of school or class that he will feel <br/>\ncomfortable with. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I know several other moms here, I guess I just need to ask if <br/>\nthey would be okay to take ds sometimes. That used to work out when <br/>\nwe lived in Seattle with a couple of my friends and their kids, <br/>\nbecause we had already done several playdates at their homes and ds <br/>\nknew them well enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me get all these ideas on paper and for offering <br/>\nsuggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJolene  =)<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;cherapple&quot; <br/>\n&lt;mosaicknits@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- &quot;Jolene&quot; &lt;joyauxjo@&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; My 3 1/2yo son is very talkative ...<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m slightly more introverted than extraverted and do not talk <br/>\n </span></blockquote>much <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; at all. ...
