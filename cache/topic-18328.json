So far I did not have to forbid<br/>\nmy sons playing with things other than the kitchen<br/>\nknives (which they can use under supervision), which<br/>\nthey understand. Now they both (5 and 2) got new<br/>\nswords at a recend Medieval Fair. The 5 year old got a<br/>\nbig wooden axe and the 2 year old a rather large<br/>\nwooden sword. I so regret that we gave in to buying<br/>\nthem, but we had been there all day and they wanted<br/>\nthem so much, and it seemed like many others were<br/>\nhaving then ...anyways. They do have lots of soft<br/>\nswords that the 2 year old is still learning not to<br/>\nhit people with it. Since he takes it everywhere I<br/>\nhave to follow in his every step so as to protect<br/>\nothers that he&#39;might&#39; hit.  He watches a lot of<br/>\nswordfighting on video (Peter Pan, Mulan, Aladdin etc.<br/>\netc.) and on the playground when his older brother<br/>\nplays with swords or sticks with his friends. <br/>\nNow they have these hard dangerous wooden weapons and<br/>\nI thought I could sort of bring them out to play at<br/>\ncertain times and then put them away again when I need<br/>\nto do other stuff (like empty the dishwasher etc..).<br/>\nNow of course they don&#39;t want to do that and carry<br/>\nthem everywhere - my 5 y.o. is very good. He would not<br/>\never intentionally hurt someone, but even when I am<br/>\nthere he has sometime gotten too close with that<br/>\nthing. My 2 y.o. I can not trust with it. He is good<br/>\nwhen I am around but he might &#39;forget&#39; and hit his<br/>\nbrother when he isn&#39;t looking  - <br/>\nMy husband suggested they be &#39;outside&#39; toys, but they<br/>\nwon&#39;t have that either. Now I am in the dilemma of<br/>\nhaving to leave them alone with their weapons for<br/>\nmoments at a time, or keep taking them away at various<br/>\ntimes during the day, which does not feel right<br/>\neither, as I don&#39;t want to suddenly become the monster<br/>\nmoma who takes away their favorite toys &#39;randomly&#39; as<br/>\nit would be understood by the 2 y.o. Also, I do trust<br/>\nmy 5 y.o. but I can not just take away the 2 y.o,<br/>\nbecause to him that would be pure injustice. <br/>\nI don&#39;t let them take them into the bedroom or to the<br/>\nmall or playground, they have their soft ones for<br/>\nthat, and that has not been a problem. At night they<br/>\norganize their weapons into their &#39;weapon chambers&#39;. <br/>\nThey are not a at all  violent boys. They are<br/>\ngenerally careful and compassionate with each other,<br/>\nit is just the 2 y.o. I am worried about and then I am<br/>\nworried about the 5 y.o. accidentally hurting his<br/>\nyounger brother which has happened before (even when I<br/>\nwas right there -) <br/>\nNothing has happened, I am just so worried that it<br/>\nmight that it really stresses me out when I watch them<br/>\nplay with it. <br/>\nI also have this antipathy (is that a word in english)<br/>\nfor weapons in general and yesterday I told my 5 y.o.<br/>\n&#39;I only fight with you because I love you, and you<br/>\nlike it so much -&quot;  <br/>\nHe loves playing the bad guy but is really very sweet<br/>\nand kind and would never REALLY hurt a living soul.<br/>\nI am just confused as to what to do - tell them it was<br/>\na mistake, I should not have bought them, because it<br/>\nstresses me so much?<br/>\nJust try to be there ALL the time and let the house go<br/>\nto the dumps until they do something else (build<br/>\nlegos, watch a video etc.) and just relax about it<br/>\nsome more ? Even if they play peacefully with<br/>\nsomething else and I go do something, I still won&#39;t<br/>\nknow if the 2 y.o. wont pick it up again and want to<br/>\nfight etc.<br/>\nWhat kind of principles do you use with weapon toys? <br/>\nI hope this is comprehensible - it clearly is my<br/>\nbiggest &#39;issue&#39; otherwise we are having a wonderful<br/>\nlife and of course do lots of other things. The only<br/>\nthing being that they take their &#39;soft&#39; swords<br/>\neverywhere, and even that stresses me out  (even if<br/>\nthey do not hurt others, my 2 y.o. has knocked over<br/>\nthings when I wasn&#39;t fast enough, and did hit another<br/>\nchild that was near the one playing swordfighting with<br/>\nhim, he just can not discern  that yet. On the<br/>\nplayground the other day another unschooled kid loved<br/>\nplaying with him, saying &#39;hit me&#39; and having him run <br/>\nafter him, my 2 y.o. was having the greatest fun, and<br/>\nyet, how is he to understand when and when not to<br/>\nhit?) <br/>\nAny help with this is highly appreciated.<br/>\nLots of love to you all,<br/>\nMara<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
