I feel you are right on track with what you just wrote above! I LOVE <br/>\nit!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest daughter was just in a similar situation a couple days ago with <br/>\nsome kid she used to go to school with. The girl had gotten her screen name from <br/>\nan old friend and while IM&#39;ing and chatting back and forth, the kid started <br/>\nsaying some pretty rude things about homeschoolers (telling her the nasty <br/>\n&quot;labels&quot; that everyone at school had for homeschoolers etc.) I told my dd that by <br/>\ngetting angry from the girls words she was only giving the girl control over <br/>\nher. I suggested that if she wanted to respond to the girl, that she try to use <br/>\nher words in kindness as best she could to explain where she is coming from as <br/>\na hs&#39;er. To try and &quot;educate&quot; the girl about hs&#39;ers in a positive way instead <br/>\nof reacting in anger. She ended up writing back to the kid that she was sorry <br/>\nshe felt that way about hs&#39;ers. That she understood and remembers how it was <br/>\nbeing in a place that tends to put labels on everyone, but, that among her & <br/>\nher hs friends they don&#39;t really have the need for those labels at all and she&#39;s <br/>\nsorry that the kid felt that labels were so important to her. My dd turned to <br/>\ntell me what she wrote back and then said &quot;Ya know, I feel so sorry for kids <br/>\nlike her. They seem so angry and sad. I wouldn&#39;t want to be inside of her.&quot; <br/>\nWow, that was my kid saying that, the one who was so frustrated, stressed, etc., <br/>\na year ago when she was in school. I cannot believe what unschooling has done <br/>\nfor us in our lives. <br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate what you wrote and I am forwarding it on to my kids.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"7"},"subject":"strategy for deflecting ignorance with grace","postDate":"1141565144","msgId":10450,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR1ZW9zbytlZzRrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10447,"nextInTopic":10459,"prevInTime":10449,"nextInTime":10451,"topicId":10430,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I truly believe that experiences with rude cashiers and the like are wonderful teaching moments.

I have <br/>\ndiscovered that taking the focus off other people and placing it <br/>\nsquarely on us serves as a lesson.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe experience ignorance on a regular basis.  I tell my children that <br/>\nthese experiences are like little tests of our patience and <br/>\ncompassion. If my children are annoyed or angered by someone&#39;s <br/>\ncomment I have learned to ask them why they would want to give other <br/>\npeople the power to effect their emotions.  I explain that we are <br/>\nthe captains of our own ships.  I remind them not to turn the <br/>\ncontrol of their ship over to some one else.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWould it work to say &quot;We home school.&quot; You could reply with a <br/>\nconfident & joyful expression. People that don&#39;t home school <br/>\nnormally just don&#39;t get it.  Have compassion for them and rejoice in <br/>\nthe fact that YOU do get it!!
