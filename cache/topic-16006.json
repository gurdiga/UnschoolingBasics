I see it as working it out so  that <br/>\nboth people get what they want.  I don&#39;t see it as giving up what you  initially <br/>\nwanted.  Remember it is OK to change your mind for something more  <br/>\npreferable.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But meeting needs in the long-term is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what I&#39;m more  concerned about rather than in each moment.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nFor us all needs are important, long term and moment to moment. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, we work it out until we come to a mutually agreeable  solution,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but that often means compromise..but that often means compromise..&lt;WBR&gt;.<br/>\nright now, but she gets it on the way back or some similar  compromise.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nAs long as it is agreeable then is she really giving up anything?   That is <br/>\npart of living in a loving family where you are confident that your  needs are <br/>\ntaken seriously and that you will work, when conflict arises, to see  that <br/>\neveryone&#39;s needs are met.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t choose to use the word compromise but sometimes I do use it, just  as <br/>\nmost unschoolers choose not to use the word &quot;teach&quot; but sometimes do use the  <br/>\nword.  It is the feeling that it gives off.  And like I said before I  don&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve it is the word as much as it is the meaning behind the word.   I <br/>\nprefer not to use the word teach because of the &quot;vibe&quot; it gives off and the  <br/>\nmeaning it has for me and I also choose not to use the word &quot;compromise&quot;.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt isn&#39;t a &quot;right&quot;-&quot;wrong&quot; here.  This is what we have found that  really <br/>\nworks for our family.  Finding agreeable solutions works for  us.  Taking <br/>\neveryone seriously, everyone&#39;s wants, needs, feelings, ideas,  thoughts etc helps <br/>\nbring us closer.  It works in our family and works in  our dealings outside the <br/>\nfamily as well.  These are tools that work in so  many different situations.  <br/>\nThe ability to know that a solution is out  there that can meet the needs of <br/>\nall involved is very empowering.

I don&#39;t think compromise is a bad word. Sometimes when I <br/>\nread  about consensual living it sounds like the solution comes only after one  <br/>\nperson &#39;consents&#39; to want what the others want -- or to give the others what  <br/>\nthey want. I know it wouldn&#39;t take long for me to resent always consenting to <br/>\n the other person&#39;s preference. In compromise, each person gives a little --  <br/>\nnot in sacrifice to the other&#39;s whims, but from a genuine desire to see  <br/>\neveryone have some joy. So it&#39;s not a bad thing, but a choice.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\nFor me it would depend on what compromise means.  CL isn&#39;t really  about <br/>\nusing predefined words as much as it is about discussing what people  mean by the <br/>\nwords they use.  Different people can have a different image of  what <br/>\ncompromise means in their own head.  Just like many other words.   In CL it is not <br/>\nabout giving up what you want or consenting to what others want  (unless of <br/>\ncourse you want to....I mean I can&#39;t change what other want but  sometimes with <br/>\nmore information something that my children or dh wants may be  more appealing to <br/>\nme than what I originally wanted).  There are no  martyrs in CL.  But I <br/>\ntotally believe that there is always a solution out  there where everyone gets what <br/>\nthey want.  I also recognize that it is OK  to change your mind.  I may <br/>\ninitially think that I want X and only X will  work for me at this particular point <br/>\nin time.  But after exploring some  options I may see that Y is also pretty <br/>\ncool and would work as well.  CL  means being really creative and willing to <br/>\nexplore all options when there are  conflicting wants or needs and work out a <br/>\nsolution where everyone gets what they  want. <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I have found when there seems to be no solution  that seems to work is <br/>\nthat we (whoever is involved) just haven&#39;t come up with  the solution, not that <br/>\nthere isn&#39;t one there.  And that happens too.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think by saying that there is just no workable  solution where everyone&#39;s <br/>\nneeds/wants are met it just makes it acceptable to use  coercion in one form or <br/>\nanother.  That doesn&#39;t work for us.  May work  for others but just not for <br/>\nus.  Living Consensually is what works for our  family.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut if any of you would like more information or would  like to check it out <br/>\nfurther you are more than welcome to pop over to the CL  yahoo list.  I think <br/>\nwe have posted the link a few times here.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPam G<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209676473,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;oh.kneel@...&gt;","profile":"kc2ark","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Consensual Living","postDate":"1153967087","msgId":16006,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGVhOTg1ZithdmduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19082,"prevInTime":16005,"nextInTime":16007,"topicId":16006,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have found another yahoo group which I am enjoying so I thought I would pass on to anyone else who might like to check it out.
