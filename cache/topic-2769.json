He IS still reading. And I am amazed at what he HAS <br/>\nread over the past years even though he&#39;s not quite 8. Hmmm...so I&#39;ll be happy <br/>\nwith that. <br/>\n  <br/>\n - Also he is his OWN person with his OWN interests and passions. <br/>\n&quot;I&quot; detest comic books, but he loves them! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n - He listens to an enormous amount of books on tape each night before bed. I <br/>\nforgot that! And it&#39;s good literature too...and mostly all unabridged ! <br/>\n<br/>\n - He does read alot of things ONLINE. Forgot about that one too!<br/>\n<br/>\n It&#39;s hard to ignore my feelings completely...because &quot;you feel what you <br/>\nfeel&quot; but I think I understand now.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  And I love the idea about talking to him about and helping him find books <br/>\nhe wants to read and even reading them myself. I know my son absolutely &quot;glows&quot; <br/>\nwhen I ask him about Yugioh and Star Wars and Harry Potter. But honestly <br/>\nafter 10 minutes my eyes glaze over...but Shhh! ..He need not know that &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again !<br/>\n~Marcia in MA   ...who still needs a bit of help from time to time on this <br/>\nwonderful journey..Unschooling :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2485,"nextTopicId":2731}}
