I agree that 2 year olds need a lot of activity - lots  <br/>\nof hands-on experience - lots of outdoor play for all that big muscle  <br/>\nstuff and lots of pretend play and lots of opportunity to do things  <br/>\nlike sorting and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t limit tv, either though. I&#39;d start FROM the tv - I&#39;d add  <br/>\nto it. For example, when my little one was all thrilled with Arthur -  <br/>\nwe got every Arthur book, we got Arthur toys, we had an Arthur lunch  <br/>\nbox which she loved to pack up with various supplies to go outside on  <br/>\nthe patio and have lunch with all her Arthur dolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus - do things 2 year olds can really get into. Making playdough is  <br/>\nthe most wonderful thing - let him choose the colors and the flavors  <br/>\n(try peppermint or pineapple flavoring). Make a HUGE bowl of instant  <br/>\npudding and put it in the bathtub with him along with a bunch of  <br/>\npaintbrushes or plastic dishes. Don&#39;t try to drag him away from the  <br/>\ntv to do these things - offer them during a lull - not when you know  <br/>\nhis favorite show is on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND - do what Ren said about having things out in the tv area. LOTS  <br/>\nof things. We always had all kinds of things like duplos and building  <br/>\nblocks and stuff like that. Big stuff for a 2 year old, right? Those  <br/>\ncardboard bricks. OR - pull the cushions off the couch and pile them  <br/>\non the floor with some blankets. He&#39;ll play with them. Plastic toy  <br/>\ndishes, pretend play stuff to use as dress-ups, there is an infinite  <br/>\namount of stuff you could put right out with him. If it isn&#39;t there,  <br/>\nhe might be too pre-occupied with the tv to think, for himself, of  <br/>\ndoing those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"young children, tv and choices","postDate":"1152018097","msgId":15318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU4ZG9yaCsxOTR2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15328,"prevInTime":15317,"nextInTime":15319,"topicId":15318,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So, my 4 y.o. has been doing pretty well with the self-regulating.

He watches on average about<br/>\n1-2 videos a day. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know your question is about the younger child, but this jumped out<br/>\nat me. You were hoping for a specific result. That isn&#39;t trust. If you<br/>\napprove of his &quot;self-regulating&quot; because it falls into your comfort<br/>\nzone, that&#39;s not really trusting him in regards to television.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he was reading 1-2 books a day, would you say he&#39;s &quot;been doing<br/>\npretty well with the self-regulating&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the younger child, if tv has been kept away from them for a<br/>\nwhile, or regulated in the past, it will be more fascinating for a<br/>\nwhile. Probably not as long as a child that has had it limited for<br/>\nyears (like my oldest child, who spent a year heavily watching) but<br/>\nhe&#39;s getting filled up with something that is interesting, that he<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have as much of before.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and the 4y.o. can be doing other things while he watches, isn&#39;t<br/>\nthat great?:)  And you can sit and watch with him some too. It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhave to be tv or nothing. You can bring toys, games, food into the<br/>\nroom while he&#39;s watching and there can be simultaneous activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe may not want to do anything other than the tv for a little while,<br/>\nbut eventuall you might find him playing legos while watching, coming<br/>\nand going from a show or dancing/talking etc...while watching.<br/>\nRight now, he&#39;s just very, very fascinated it sounds like.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep lotsa tactile stuff that young children need available, but trust<br/>\nthat tv can only hold power over people if you make it a bigger deal<br/>\nthan it needs to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;self-regulation&quot; isn&#39;t the goal.
