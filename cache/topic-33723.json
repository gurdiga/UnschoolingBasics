But the child sees the world  <br/>\ndifferently. Imposing an adult viewpoint (and solution) won&#39;t force  <br/>\nhim to change from a child&#39;s viewpoint to an adult&#39;s. Time, age,  <br/>\ngrowth, maturity will do that. He&#39;ll have an adult&#39;s view point when  <br/>\nhe&#39;s an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will understand better if our solutions match their view of the  <br/>\nworld. To a child, parents have money that they spend on stuff the  <br/>\nparents want all the time. And the parents have an &quot;It&#39;s mine!&quot;  <br/>\nattitude towards the money. Occasionally they&#39;ll begrudgingly share a  <br/>\nbit, if they agree with what the child wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it&#39;s not a completely accurate picture (though more accurate  <br/>\nthan adults will admit!) it&#39;s not a picture a child can be argued out  <br/>\nof. It&#39;s just how they&#39;ll view the world until they&#39;re older.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an adult lived that way, having to go through the process of  <br/>\nconvincing their partner that every purchase was worthy and then wait  <br/>\nfor approval, not only would it be frustrating but it wouldn&#39;t do  <br/>\nmuch for the relationship!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy should kids feel differently? Kids see parents spending hundreds  <br/>\nof dollars at the grocery store for stuff the parents want (and stuff  <br/>\nthe parents approve of for the kids) and the kids can&#39;t have a candy  <br/>\nbar at the check out?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside of holding tight to our money until a child jumps  <br/>\nthrough a hoop for it is that it models being closed and Scroogy with  <br/>\nothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe upside of generosity is that 1) it models that behavior for kids  <br/>\nand 2) they feel full rather than needy. When they&#39;re full, they are  <br/>\nway more likely to feel generous (with their time, money, patience,  <br/>\netc.) with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd generous doesn&#39;t mean just handing to them whatever they ask.  <br/>\nGenerous means seeing their needs as important and showing the child  <br/>\nthat you are willing to work to get those needs met. If, for  <br/>\ninstance, there&#39;s a limited food budget and my daughter wanted  <br/>\nsomething, we could talk about what to cut back on so she could get  <br/>\nthat thing. When they see us working hard, they know things don&#39;t  <br/>\ncome for free. When they see us working hard for what they want, they  <br/>\nwill be generous and work hard to help us get what we want. (Not just  <br/>\na theory! Lots of parents will corroborate this! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something I wrote a while ago that might help:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; #3. I make him do chores for money to EARN a toy<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While from an adult point of view it seems reasonable, what you&#39;re<br/>\nmodeling is &quot;This is mine. [The money.] And if you want any of it,<br/>\nI&#39;m going to make you jump through hoops to get it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture this: sister asks brother if she can borrow his box of 64<br/>\ncrayons and he says &quot;If you clean up my room, I&#39;ll let you have 3.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what you&#39;re modeling for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re on a budget, be patient with him as he struggles to<br/>\nunderstand how the world works. (You can discuss how you and he can<br/>\ncut down on food expenses so the money can be shifted to other<br/>\nthings. You can help him become a savvy shopper :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut explaining why you can&#39;t do such and such isn&#39;t enough.** He has<br/>\nto be old enough to really get the concepts. He might understand the<br/>\nwords, but when mom says she doesn&#39;t have the money when she&#39;s<br/>\nhanding over money left and right for things *she* wants (food,<br/>\nclothing that&#39;s supposedly a gift for him that he doesn&#39;t even want,<br/>\netc.) then the world seems hugely confusing.  (Even worse is &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to spend the money on that,&quot; which, from his viewpoint, he&#39;d get<br/>\npunished for saying because it&#39;s been drilled into his head that *he*<br/>\nhas to share what&#39;s his when others ask.)<br/>\n<br/>\n** (And often it isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s that we don&#39;t want to, eg, we don&#39;t<br/>\nwant to eat beans and rice instead of meat one night to help him get<br/>\na toy. But the more we *help* them, the more they feel that we&#39;re on<br/>\ntheir team working with them to help them get what they want, the<br/>\nmore we model generosity.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":151505017,"authorName":"carenkh","from":"&quot;carenkh&quot; &lt;carenkh@...&gt;","profile":"carenkh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Hi All - need a link or something","postDate":"1213206333","msgId":33724,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcycDJ2dCtzZjRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcycDBxNCt0bzBwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33723,"nextInTopic":33725,"prevInTime":33723,"nextInTime":33725,"topicId":33723,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This doesn t go into the issue specifically, but this blog entry from Pam G says a lot, I think: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1059407125\">This doesn&#39;t go into the issue specifically, but this blog entry from<br/>\nPam G says a lot, I think:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-youngest-phil-has-been-experimenting.html\">http://gentlegull.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-youngest-phil-has-been-experimenting.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nor, if that gets cut off - <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3t3laz\">http://tinyurl.com/3t3laz</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always admired how she handles finances with her family.

I was <br/>\ntrying to point out that if you applied the same logic in an adult-<br/>\nadult situation (for example, an at-home mom earning the money to buy <br/>\na pair of shoes by scrubbing and waxing the kitchen floor) it doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfly really well but it&#39;s considered perfectly okay in an adult-child <br/>\nrelationship.

I said Well, what if she makes $10K <br/>\nper year and you make $5K per year (easy numbers to work with) - does <br/>\nthat mean that she has $5K to spend as she pleases and if you want <br/>\nmore than your own $5K that you earned at your employment, you have <br/>\nto ask her to pay you for &#39;chores&#39; around the house? His response was <br/>\nthat in a couple, the money is shared in common. I said, well then <br/>\nwhy doesn&#39;t that apply to any children in the household too since <br/>\nthey are in the same position, economically, as the non-employed <br/>\npartner?
