What can I say, just when I thought I&#39;ve understood enough to <br/>\nmake that all important decision to homeschool our 6 year old son, <br/>\nand then, when researching the all important &quot;do I or do I not limit <br/>\nthe playstation?&quot;, I&#39;ve stumbled into the &quot;world of unschooling&quot;, a <br/>\ntotally different segment of homeschooling, only deeper! I like <br/>\nwhat&#39;ve I&#39;ve read so far about unschooling, it makes sense to me as <br/>\nI was one a little child too but it is too scary/radical for me as <br/>\nmother, to accept??!! Strange how it all makes perfect sense to me <br/>\non one side but yet hard to let go on the other. But as always, for <br/>\nme and my kid, common sense rules and wins all the time!   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the playstation? Well, I&#39;ve read enough to understand that it <br/>\ncan be educational too, and if we don&#39;t put time limit on it, it <br/>\nwon&#39;t be that &#39;unforbidden fruit&#39; and will lose it&#39;s novelty <br/>\neventually, as did the tv and the pc! <br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to have found your world and will be staying for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith best regards,<br/>\nSharonC</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22246,"nextTopicId":22255}}
