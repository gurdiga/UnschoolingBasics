I used to have a lot of fear <br/>\n<br/>\nabout him wanting to go to school before I had a chance to get us to <br/>\n<br/>\nthe free and happy unschooling life I had embraced in theory but not <br/>\n<br/>\nyet fully in practice. Initially, joining a homeschool co-op helped <br/>\n<br/>\nsome as he had/has a place he can call his &quot;school&quot; with a &quot;teacher&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n(he does a Spanish class) and a playground. But I would feel <br/>\n<br/>\nthreatened when he talked about wanting to go back to preschool or <br/>\n<br/>\neventually to a school for bigger kids- I could feel it in the pit of <br/>\n<br/>\nmy stomach and knew my visceral reaction meant my thinking around <br/>\n<br/>\nthis was not clear and positive and he fully picked up on that <br/>\n<br/>\nenergy. But for a long time I had a really hard time figuring out how <br/>\n<br/>\nto shift it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve actually just recognized recently what a big shift has happened <br/>\n<br/>\nfor us in this and it was reflected in a conversation we just had as <br/>\n<br/>\nhe&#39;s reacting to all the talk of friends going back to school soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt went something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;Mom, I&#39;m not going to go to the school yet where I ride the <br/>\n<br/>\nschool bus, right?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Yeah, you want to go back to your school in Munster&quot; (our weekly <br/>\n<br/>\nhomeschool co-op)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;yeah&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;I was thinking you don&#39;t ever have to go to that school where <br/>\n<br/>\nyou ride the school bus because you&#39;d have to go every day, all day <br/>\n<br/>\nlong. But you don&#39;t have to go to that school to ride a school bus. <br/>\n<br/>\nHey, how about we ride a school bus to go to the fair today? <br/>\n<br/>\n(Beautiful serendipity- we had plans to go to the county fair and I <br/>\n<br/>\nknew they were running school buses as shuttles from the remote <br/>\n<br/>\nparking)<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;But I want to ride one that picks us up at our house&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;Well, they do that for kids that go to school every day- it <br/>\n<br/>\npicks up everyone at their house and takes them to their school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;So should we check out the school bus that will take us to the <br/>\n<br/>\nfair?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;Yeah!&quot; (with big excited smile)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe loved it btw and I loved him loving it. I don&#39;t know if that <br/>\n<br/>\ndialogue depicts the ease and lightness I felt in this conversation <br/>\n<br/>\nwith him, but that was the big difference. I feel much more confident <br/>\n<br/>\nabout the life we&#39;re creating and the fear of him wanting school has <br/>\n<br/>\ndissipated over this year or so as we moved toward unschooling. We <br/>\n<br/>\nhad come from a pretty controlling place so I think trust-building <br/>\n<br/>\nhas been a big part of it and of course actually living what I *Know* <br/>\n<br/>\nto be a free and happy life is the other part. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how we might have come to this place faster since it&#39;s <br/>\n<br/>\nsuch a path and a process. But I know your question really helped me <br/>\n<br/>\nto analyze where I was (and wasn&#39;t) in a way I couldn&#39;t at the time, <br/>\n<br/>\nso maybe that will help you in some way. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In unschoolingbasics@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Rebecca De Hate&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;rebeccadehate@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; OK that subject line doesn&#39;t sound quite right but I think you&#39;ll<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; understand my &quot;mental&quot; dilemma.

I think it maybe <br/>\n<br/>\nthe &#39;words&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; he has heard from his not for homeschooling/ unschooling grandma and<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; his dad (who he see often -every other weekend for sure -- even <br/>\n<br/>\nthough<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; he was ok with me homeschooling since I have a teaching degree:)  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s my mental dilemma -- send him to school or not!!

But if he is feeling like<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; he is missing something by not going to school I don&#39;t want to do <br/>\n<br/>\nthat<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; either.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve thought to myself --well I&#39;m the mother and we haven&#39;t even <br/>\n<br/>\ngiven<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; it a full year -- blah, blah<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Yet...  I&#39;m also worried I&#39;ll send him then he will want to come <br/>\n<br/>\nhome<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; yet again and that will bring big attention to me from the school, <br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; dad etc..... <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; any thoughts mine are becoming jumbled....<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t <br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342833460,"authorName":"Amanda Pillow","from":"Amanda Pillow &lt;funkymamaof4@...&gt;","profile":"funkymamaof4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] my mental dilemma and some other thoughts...","postDate":"1218474173","msgId":35349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExMjU3MC44MDI0OC5xbUB3ZWI1NzMwMy5tYWlsLnJlMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35333,"nextInTopic":35350,"prevInTime":35348,"nextInTime":35350,"topicId":35294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi!

I also had the experience of placing my two older children in public school and they suffered more than they excelled.  The youngest of the two (who was normally a very energetic, exciting child) absolutely lost hisexcitement and enthusiasm for life in general.  He constantly used the words &#39;dumb&#39; and &#39;stupid&#39; to describe himself and was in tears at home trying to do his three hours of &#39;homework&#39; IN KINDERGARTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!  The oldest of the two (who was previously homeschooled for K and First grade) was told after three weeks of second grade that he would have to return to first grade.  When asked why, we were told that theteacher was unable to teach him because he needed toooooo much &#39;hands on&#39; and he asked tooooo many questions.<br/>\n (Although when given the right &#39;learning environment&#39; he was considered well beyond his &#39;age level&#39;). Since bringing them back home, I have seen the enthusiasm for learning reappear over time,and the only thing the seem to miss about school is the &#39;equipment&#39;  that comes with goingto school.  And this has rubbed off on the younger two children, who have never attendedpublic school.  How I have helped their longings for riding a bus is we go occassionally on the city bus, back packs filled with &#39;school&#39; stuff, ie notebooks, pencils, crayons, coloringbooks, etc., their lunch boxes full of goodies, and we ride around for a while and getdropped off at parks, the beach, etc.  It&#39;s  a great fun day, it satisfies their need forbuses, backpacks, and lunch boxes, and we all come home tired, but happy.  ~Amanda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":260941796,"authorName":"Heather Barahona","from":"&quot;Heather Barahona&quot; &lt;hlbarahona@...&gt;","profile":"heather_barahona","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] my mental dilemma and some other thoughts...","postDate":"1218467736","msgId":35350,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMjAwMWM4ZmJjNSQxY2I0MGNiMCQ1NjFjMjYxMCRAY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNzNCRjZGLTNCM0QtNDQyNi1BQzZFLTkzMjBERENCQTRDQ0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ2MzUwMS45MjMwLnFtQHdlYjUyODA5Lm1haWwucmUyLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDAxNDIwMWM4ZmIwYSRmNmU0NDk2MCRlNGFjZGMyMCRAY29tPiA8MTE3M0JGNkYtM0IzRC00NDI2LUFDNkUtOTMyMEREQ0JBNENDQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":35349,"nextInTopic":35355,"prevInTime":35349,"nextInTime":35351,"topicId":35294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"At first unschooling looks like a way to trick kids into learning by placing fun things around them they could learn from.

But it will  <br/>\nhelp people grasp unschooling faster to keep their own agenda to fun  <br/>\nand feeding the kids&#39; interests and giving them opportunities to  <br/>\nexpand their interests. Treat a book about George Washington the same  <br/>\nway you would a new cartoon. Is it something they might enjoy? If  <br/>\nthey say &quot;No, thanks&quot; will you have some emotional attachment to  <br/>\ntheir answer?<br/>\n<br/>\nPrecisely. :) I put things in their environment that they can learn from if<br/>\nthey want to and if they are interested in it. I have just seen homes where<br/>\nthere aren&#39;t many toys, videos, games & books (especially families that have<br/>\nkids with special needs. I have worked with children with special needs and<br/>\ntheir families for a few years now and they often get discouraged by their<br/>\nchild&#39;s lack of engagement/interest with stuff and stop buying it). It makes<br/>\nme really sad. That&#39;s not relying on the child&#39;s interest, that&#39;s just<br/>\nneglect, I think. I wanted to make the distinction that you never know what<br/>\nis going to spark your child&#39;s interest and to enrich it as much as<br/>\npossible. You couldn&#39;t expect them to want to learn to read (about George<br/>\nWashington even) if they never came into contact with a book. I feel like<br/>\nit&#39;s my job to make the world available to my children, so they can decide<br/>\nwhen and what they want to pursue further. I would never respond emotionally<br/>\nif they didn&#39;t like a toy or book I bought them. But, maybe because of our<br/>\nhistory together, that rarely (if ever) happens. Not only am I pretty<br/>\nfamiliar with their interests, I try to make everything as fun and relevant<br/>\nas possible for my kids. (And a lot of times, I think kids are looking for a<br/>\nway to interact with their parents. That interaction is what they enjoy, not<br/>\nnecessarily the book or game or whatever.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, on your website I read a discussion about grocery shopping (I<br/>\nLOVE your website! It&#39;s a wealth of useful information). For our family,<br/>\nwhen my girls were little, shopping was done first thing when we woke up in<br/>\nthe morning and the first stop we made was at the powdered donuts. They<br/>\nmunched happily as I raced through the store. As a single parent, sometimes<br/>\nI have to get a little creative about maintaining our home. But, I let<br/>\nnatural consequences take effect. When my girls wake up and want chocolate<br/>\nmilk and waffles, they become concerned when we don&#39;t have any. It is highly<br/>\nrelevant to them and really important that we have their favorite foods! So,<br/>\nthey say, &quot;Mom, we need to go to the grocery store.&quot; Yes, we do. :) When my<br/>\ngirls got older, we made grocery lists together using pictures of their<br/>\nfavorite foods. Then they helped me find the food at the store, put it in<br/>\nthe basket, and check it off the list (only if they wanted to, but they<br/>\nenjoyed it, so they usually did). Now, they can read and write, so we just<br/>\nwrite the list. I don&#39;t make them do it, though. If they don&#39;t want to<br/>\nwrite, I write it for them. But, they connect our lifestyle to the things<br/>\nthat make our lifestyle possible (like grocery shopping), and those things<br/>\nhave become important to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was long winded, but I wanted to relate that just because something<br/>\nisn&#39;t inherently enjoyable doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make it enjoyable (with<br/>\nenthusiasm and some sugar:). And if you can show a child the relevance of<br/>\nthings that aren&#39;t inherently enjoyable, they might still become important<br/>\n(even to the little ones, though they will obviously have less tolerance for<br/>\nsuch endeavors). I feel like *I* understand what you&#39;re saying about choice<br/>\nand I really, really appreciate it. But, I can understand why people think<br/>\nthat unschoolers take a &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to parenting. They see, for<br/>\nexample, watching tv as a passive activity. They don&#39;t see the active effort<br/>\nyou put into it as a parent. Yesterday, while watching tv, we looked up the<br/>\npatella, what vitamins were in blueberries that made them good for you, and<br/>\nmartial arts (where we subsequently researched capoeira, kung fu, and tai<br/>\nchi). This happened because my kids asked me questions that I didn&#39;t know<br/>\nthe answer to. (At one point during a show, my older daughter shouted, &quot;This<br/>\nthing in my leg moves! What is it?&quot; It was very cute. She realized for the<br/>\nfirst time that her knee wiggles. From there we learned that tendons connect<br/>\nmuscle to bone, and she giggled as I tickled her thigh right about where her<br/>\nknee attaches to it.) They know that we can research things, so they ask to.<br/>\nAnd next time we have blueberries for snack, or see Skunk Fu, or whatever<br/>\nelse relates, we will talk about the stuff we learned yesterday. That&#39;s not<br/>\npassive learning at all. I would say we did a lot! (Not that passive<br/>\nlearning doesn&#39;t happen, it definitely does! I just think you are a much<br/>\nmore involved parent than some might think because you say your kid can<br/>\nwatch tv all day long if she wants. They neglect to read the part about you<br/>\nbeing there acting as her guide.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for letting me wax philosophical and stuff. :)<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG. <br/>\nVersion: 7.5.524 / Virus Database: 270.6.0/1604 - Release Date: 8/11/2008<br/>\n5:50 AM</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":184269211,"authorName":"rebecca de","from":"rebecca de &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt;","profile":"rebeccadehate","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] my mental dilemma and some other thoughts...","postDate":"1218457772","msgId":35331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyNTQyOC4yMTcyOS5xbUB3ZWI1NjEwOC5tYWlsLnJlMy55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxNDIwMWM4ZmIwYSRmNmU0NDk2MCRlNGFjZGMyMCRAY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35330,"nextInTopic":35333,"prevInTime":35330,"nextInTime":35332,"topicId":35294,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Heather, that reply was just the kind I needed thank you!!

This post is long and kinda goes off on tangents,<br/>\n&gt; but it’s good.<br/>\n&gt; I’m excited and refreshed and thought I would share my<br/>\n&gt; enthusiasm. J I’m new<br/>\n&gt; to this list and unschooling, though not necessarily<br/>\n&gt; homeschooling. My<br/>\n&gt; daughters, 6 & 8 years old, were both diagnosed with<br/>\n&gt; ASD as toddlers as<br/>\n&gt; well. I spent the first several years doing much of the<br/>\n&gt; “therapy” in our<br/>\n&gt; home by myself. My children have always benefitted from<br/>\n&gt; child-directed<br/>\n&gt; learning. In fact, they resisted anything else. I am<br/>\n&gt; currently finishing a<br/>\n&gt; master’s degree in behavior analysis (which I also have<br/>\n&gt; an undergrad degree<br/>\n&gt; in). I would set up simple contingencies for my children<br/>\n&gt; (something like,<br/>\n&gt; “say nana” and if they did they could have the banana)<br/>\n&gt; and their behavior<br/>\n&gt; patterns looked like behavior under aversive control<br/>\n&gt; (coercion), which is<br/>\n&gt; not at all what I meant to do. I just wanted to help my<br/>\n&gt; kids learn to talk.<br/>\n&gt; I learned quickly to set up our environment in a way that<br/>\n&gt; promoted learning<br/>\n&gt; and to gently lead my children to activities that might<br/>\n&gt; interest them (“Hey<br/>\n&gt; girls, I found this neat butterfly art kit at the store!<br/>\n&gt; Wanna play with<br/>\n&gt; me?”). If they *were* interested, I used that opportunity<br/>\n&gt; to help them<br/>\n&gt; expand their language and knowledge. So, the unschooling<br/>\n&gt; philosophy<br/>\n&gt; resonates with me because it appears to involve placing<br/>\n&gt; things in your<br/>\n&gt; child’s environment that will promote learning and<br/>\n&gt; helping them expand their<br/>\n&gt; repertoire based on their interests and assent, and also<br/>\n&gt; rapport building<br/>\n&gt; (or, always putting the relationship first). Those are two<br/>\n&gt; of my favorite<br/>\n&gt; parts of behavior analytic technologies. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However, the school years have been very hard on all of us<br/>\n&gt; so far. I was<br/>\n&gt; constantly having to advocate for my children (which<br/>\n&gt; parents always do, but<br/>\n&gt; jeez… it gets tiresome to always be at odds with the<br/>\n&gt; school district), and<br/>\n&gt; my older one especially was suffering physically and<br/>\n&gt; mentally from her<br/>\n&gt; experience. She had stomach problems, behavior issues, she<br/>\n&gt; was sick ALL the<br/>\n&gt; time… It was totally different from when they were home<br/>\n&gt; with me until<br/>\n&gt; kindergarten and during the summers. She did not like<br/>\n&gt; school. She found it<br/>\n&gt; incredibly aversive. To have come so far, despite all of<br/>\n&gt; the challenges<br/>\n&gt; she’s faced, made me so proud of her. It hurt my heart to<br/>\n&gt; see all her<br/>\n&gt; sparkle and love for life disappear. Last year was my<br/>\n&gt; younger daughter’s<br/>\n&gt; first year of school. She felt compelled to keep up with<br/>\n&gt; her classmates. If<br/>\n&gt; she couldn’t read as well as one of her classmates, for<br/>\n&gt; example, she would<br/>\n&gt; steal his reading assignment  and try to decode it under<br/>\n&gt; the table during<br/>\n&gt; “free” time. She was also suffering mentally from the<br/>\n&gt; pressures and<br/>\n&gt; expectations. So, school is not okay for us. I want my<br/>\n&gt; children to be able<br/>\n&gt; to choose whatever they want, but when my older daughter<br/>\n&gt; says she wants to<br/>\n&gt; go back to school, I know she is not choosing academic<br/>\n&gt; pressure and stomach<br/>\n&gt; aches and coercion. In her case, I know she just misses her<br/>\n&gt; friends. I take<br/>\n&gt; that as a cue that she doesn’t feel like she’s had<br/>\n&gt; enough socialization<br/>\n&gt; lately and make a lot of effort to connect with old friends<br/>\n&gt; or make new<br/>\n&gt; ones. (Interestingly, my younger daughter does not have the<br/>\n&gt; intense need for<br/>\n&gt; socialization that my older one does and, despite having a<br/>\n&gt; natural affinity<br/>\n&gt; for all things academic, has NO desire to go back to school<br/>\n&gt; this fall.) So,<br/>\n&gt; perhaps your son is just experiencing something similar. I<br/>\n&gt; thought everyone<br/>\n&gt; gave really great advice, and I’m sure you have a bunch<br/>\n&gt; of ideas now. I just<br/>\n&gt; wanted to let you know you’re not alone. J<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now I will go off on a tangent… I’ve read a lot of well<br/>\n&gt; controlled,<br/>\n&gt; convincing research over the last 8 years or so, and I feel<br/>\n&gt; like sharing (I<br/>\n&gt; hope that’s ok). The unschooling philosophy appears to be<br/>\n&gt; extremely<br/>\n&gt; consistent with what I’ve learned at university about<br/>\n&gt; behavior. People that<br/>\n&gt; operate under aversive control (threats), to escape or<br/>\n&gt; avoid negative<br/>\n&gt; consequences (“Johnny, if you don’t stop right now,<br/>\n&gt; you’re going to time<br/>\n&gt; out”), often engage in behavior that is hostile or<br/>\n&gt; aggressive; have strong<br/>\n&gt; emotional responses; and seek to counter-control (either<br/>\n&gt; overtly by saying<br/>\n&gt; “you can’t make me!”, or covertly through sabotage or<br/>\n&gt; under-achievement).<br/>\n&gt; People that operate under punishment contingencies (instead<br/>\n&gt; of threatening<br/>\n&gt; to put Johnny in time out, mom spanks him) seek to AVOID<br/>\n&gt; the punisher.<br/>\n&gt; That’s so powerful to me. Do I really want my children to<br/>\n&gt; associate me with<br/>\n&gt; power struggles? Do I want them to associate me with<br/>\n&gt; punishment, so that *I*<br/>\n&gt; become a punisher and they seek to avoid me? I’ve learned<br/>\n&gt; that antecedent<br/>\n&gt; strategies (putting something in the environment that will<br/>\n&gt; promote behavior)<br/>\n&gt; is much more desirable than placing consequences (good or<br/>\n&gt; bad) on behavior.<br/>\n&gt; By loving children unconditionally and allowing the<br/>\n&gt; environment to produce<br/>\n&gt; the consequences instead of socially mediating, parents can<br/>\n&gt; associate<br/>\n&gt; themselves with joy. J The environment then, according to<br/>\n&gt; the child’s<br/>\n&gt; interests and talents, will select behaviors that function<br/>\n&gt; for the child. If<br/>\n&gt; a child is not inherently “sporty”, the environment<br/>\n&gt; will probably not select<br/>\n&gt; “sporty” behaviors, even if the child is exposed to<br/>\n&gt; sports. By that, I mean,<br/>\n&gt; the environment (sports) will not provide consequences that<br/>\n&gt; are valuable to<br/>\n&gt; the child.  By *making* the child be involved in sports<br/>\n&gt; against their will<br/>\n&gt; to teach them “teamwork” or whatever else feels<br/>\n&gt; justified, people create an<br/>\n&gt; aversive environment that the child will work to avoid. By<br/>\n&gt; allowing the<br/>\n&gt; environment to provide the consequences, children do not<br/>\n&gt; rely on socially<br/>\n&gt; mediated (arbitrary) consequences. You can be sure, then,<br/>\n&gt; that everything<br/>\n&gt; they pursue is intrinsically valuable to them. They will be<br/>\n&gt; much happier and<br/>\n&gt; their families will be much happier as a result. Everyone<br/>\n&gt; still operates<br/>\n&gt; under *some* aversive control (like speeding tickets.<br/>\n&gt; Basically every law we<br/>\n&gt; have is enforced by aversive control). There is no way to<br/>\n&gt; avoid it<br/>\n&gt; completely. But, I can avoid being the source of aversive<br/>\n&gt; control for my<br/>\n&gt; children and create an environment that promotes mutual<br/>\n&gt; respect (instead of<br/>\n&gt; fear) and trust. *I* choose that!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for reading.

J I’m new ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-225568832\">Hi there! This post is long and kinda goes off on tangents, but it�s good.<br/>\nI�m excited and refreshed and thought I would share my enthusiasm. J I�m new<br/>\nto this list and unschooling, though not necessarily homeschooling. My<br/>\ndaughters, 6 & 8 years old, were both diagnosed with ASD as toddlers as<br/>\nwell. I spent the first several years doing much of the �therapy� in our<br/>\nhome by myself. My children have always benefitted from child-directed<br/>\nlearning. In fact, they resisted anything else. I am currently finishing a<br/>\nmaster�s degree in behavior analysis (which I also have an undergrad degree<br/>\nin). I would set up simple contingencies for my children (something like,<br/>\n�say nana� and if they did they could have the banana) and their behavior<br/>\npatterns looked like behavior under aversive control (coercion), which is<br/>\nnot at all what I meant to do. I just wanted to help my kids learn to talk.<br/>\nI learned quickly to set up our environment in a way that promoted learning<br/>\nand to gently lead my children to activities that might interest them (�Hey<br/>\ngirls, I found this neat butterfly art kit at the store! Wanna play with<br/>\nme?�). If they *were* interested, I used that opportunity to help them<br/>\nexpand their language and knowledge. So, the unschooling philosophy<br/>\nresonates with me because it appears to involve placing things in your<br/>\nchild�s environment that will promote learning and helping them expand their<br/>\nrepertoire based on their interests and assent, and also rapport building<br/>\n(or, always putting the relationship first). Those are two of my favorite<br/>\nparts of behavior analytic technologies. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the school years have been very hard on all of us so far. I was<br/>\nconstantly having to advocate for my children (which parents always do, but<br/>\njeez� it gets tiresome to always be at odds with the school district), and<br/>\nmy older one especially was suffering physically and mentally from her<br/>\nexperience. She had stomach problems, behavior issues, she was sick ALL the<br/>\ntime� It was totally different from when they were home with me until<br/>\nkindergarten and during the summers. She did not like school. She found it<br/>\nincredibly aversive. To have come so far, despite all of the challenges<br/>\nshe�s faced, made me so proud of her. It hurt my heart to see all her<br/>\nsparkle and love for life disappear. Last year was my younger daughter�s<br/>\nfirst year of school. She felt compelled to keep up with her classmates. If<br/>\nshe couldn�t read as well as one of her classmates, for example, she would<br/>\nsteal his reading assignment  and try to decode it under the table during<br/>\n�free� time. She was also suffering mentally from the pressures and<br/>\nexpectations. So, school is not okay for us. I want my children to be able<br/>\nto choose whatever they want, but when my older daughter says she wants to<br/>\ngo back to school, I know she is not choosing academic pressure and stomach<br/>\naches and coercion. In her case, I know she just misses her friends. I take<br/>\nthat as a cue that she doesn�t feel like she�s had enough socialization<br/>\nlately and make a lot of effort to connect with old friends or make new<br/>\nones. (Interestingly, my younger daughter does not have the intense need for<br/>\nsocialization that my older one does and, despite having a natural affinity<br/>\nfor all things academic, has NO desire to go back to school this fall.)

I used to have a lot of fear <br/>\nabout him wanting to go to school before I had a chance to get us to <br/>\nthe free and happy unschooling life I had embraced in theory but not <br/>\nyet fully in practice. Initially, joining a homeschool co-op helped <br/>\nsome as he had/has a place he can call his &quot;school&quot; with a &quot;teacher&quot; <br/>\n(he does a Spanish class) and a playground. But I would feel <br/>\nthreatened when he talked about wanting to go back to preschool or <br/>\neventually to a school for bigger kids- I could feel it in the pit of <br/>\nmy stomach and knew my visceral reaction meant my thinking around <br/>\nthis was not clear and positive and he fully picked up on that <br/>\nenergy. But for a long time I had a really hard time figuring out how <br/>\nto shift it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve actually just recognized recently what a big shift has happened <br/>\nfor us in this and it was reflected in a conversation we just had as <br/>\nhe&#39;s reacting to all the talk of friends going back to school soon. <br/>\nIt went something like:<br/>\n<br/>\nJ: &quot;Mom, I&#39;m not going to go to the school yet where I ride the <br/>\nschool bus, right?&quot; <br/>\nMe: &quot;Yeah, you want to go back to your school in Munster&quot; (our weekly <br/>\nhomeschool co-op)<br/>\nJ: &quot;yeah&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;I was thinking you don&#39;t ever have to go to that school where <br/>\nyou ride the school bus because you&#39;d have to go every day, all day <br/>\nlong. But you don&#39;t have to go to that school to ride a school bus. <br/>\nHey, how about we ride a school bus to go to the fair today? <br/>\n(Beautiful serendipity- we had plans to go to the county fair and I <br/>\nknew they were running school buses as shuttles from the remote <br/>\nparking)<br/>\nJ: &quot;But I want to ride one that picks us up at our house&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;Well, they do that for kids that go to school every day- it <br/>\npicks up everyone at their house and takes them to their school.&quot;<br/>\nJ: &quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>\nMe: &quot;So should we check out the school bus that will take us to the <br/>\nfair?&quot;<br/>\nJ: &quot;Yeah!&quot; (with big excited smile)<br/>\n <br/>\nHe loved it btw and I loved him loving it. I don&#39;t know if that <br/>\ndialogue depicts the ease and lightness I felt in this conversation <br/>\nwith him, but that was the big difference. I feel much more confident <br/>\nabout the life we&#39;re creating and the fear of him wanting school has <br/>\ndissipated over this year or so as we moved toward unschooling.

I&#39;m not there but it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t sound like pride.  When children go to school a big part of the<br/>\nfeelings about their own competence become related in their minds with<br/>\nschool performance and academics.  It takes quite a bit of adjustment to<br/>\nfigure out what he wants.  Just go toward what he finds enjoyable or<br/>\nrelaxing or FUN: swimming, playing in any way he likes whether it&#39;s with<br/>\nlegos, in the dirt, video games, TV, talking, fingerpainting, blowing<br/>\nbubbles, whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he seems to be missing his school friends, you might be able to arrange<br/>\nfor some get togethers.  Other than that if it were me, I would continue<br/>\nmeeting with other kids-- but only if he seems to want to.  Sometimes<br/>\nchanging everything all at once (which is ideal in most ways) is a lot to<br/>\nacclimate to.  All of a sudden, his friends are back in school and he&#39;s<br/>\nnot.  It&#39;s normal to feel out of sorts with wholesale changes, and children<br/>\nare either in school or they&#39;re not.  Not much middle ground to gradually<br/>\nmove through.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have experience dealing with taking a child out of school because<br/>\nKarl has never gone to school.  There are plenty of others here who do have<br/>\nexperience with it and are now unschooling.  Kelly Lovejoy, for one.  She<br/>\nand others post frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might look up Rue Kream&#39;s book Parenting a Free Child (<br/>\nhttp://www.freechild.info/) where she chronicles her experience of switching<br/>\nfrom school to unschooling with her daughter Dagny.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/9/08, rebecca de &lt;rebeccadehate@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I have tired asking this -- at first I get the I don&#39;t know! then I<br/>\n&gt; start asking questions or talking to much!!  any suggestions on how to &quot;get&quot;<br/>\n&gt; him to open up on the why?<br/>\n&gt; I really think he just liked all the kids/friends.  but I do have him<br/>\n&gt; around a group and other kids.

But if he is feeling like<br/>\nhe is missing something by not going to school I don&#39;t want to do that<br/>\neither.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve thought to myself --well I&#39;m the mother and we haven&#39;t even given<br/>\nit a full year -- blah, blah<br/>\n<br/>\nYet...  I&#39;m also worried I&#39;ll send him then he will want to come home<br/>\nyet again and that will bring big attention to me from the school, and<br/>\ndad etc..... <br/>\n<br/>\nany thoughts mine are becoming jumbled....</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35182,"nextTopicId":35335}}
