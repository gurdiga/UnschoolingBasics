The range of employers is as broad as the range of people. There  <br/>\nwill be some jobs -- mostly corporate -- closed off to those without  <br/>\na degree. There are jobs closed off to those with a degree! But there  <br/>\nare lots of people with small businesses willing to hire eager workers.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I worked for a small (100 person) company and someone with a Harvard  <br/>\ndegree applied for work in the finance department. The manager was  <br/>\ndazzled. The rest of us could see the work was not Harvard level  <br/>\nchallenging and she just wanted the experience and would be gone in a  <br/>\nyear. (Or just wanted the experience interviewing! ;-) I remember a  <br/>\nfew decades ago the &quot;brain glut&quot; when there were too many  <br/>\noverqualified people and they wouldn&#39;t get hired for jobs they had  <br/>\ntoo much education for.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut unschooling does *NOT* get in the way of someone going onto  <br/>\ncollege! The unschoolers who want to go onto college, do so. (My  <br/>\ndaughter took some college classes starting at 14 with no problems.)  <br/>\nBut unlike schooled kids, they see it as one way to pursue their  <br/>\ninterests rather than as 4 more years of hoops to jump through to get  <br/>\nsome job with a good salary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that a lot of unschooling parents only see things from their  <br/>\n&gt; perspective.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty safe to say that all unschoolers have both schooling and  <br/>\nunschooler perspective. Very few were raised as unschoolers!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to expect to find support *on an  <br/>\nunschooling list* for ideas outside of unschooling. This is a place  <br/>\nto find what it&#39;s like to be an unschooler and help on putting  <br/>\nunschooling into practice. It&#39;s not a support list for anyone who  <br/>\nhappens along. Everyone is welcome who wants to come here to find out  <br/>\nmore about unschooling, but it&#39;s unreasonable to expect anything  <br/>\nbeyond &quot;Welcome! Glad you want to find out more.&quot; Just as a vegan  <br/>\nmeeting might be supportive of an omnivore who came to find out more,  <br/>\nthe meeting needs to focus on the needs of those who came for the  <br/>\nvegan information or risk losing the audience it&#39;s targeting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s loads of support here for someone&#39;s *need* to find out more  <br/>\nabout unschooling, even if they only go part way.

I don&#39;t push  <br/>\nthe ideas on anyone, but do offer information about learning that  <br/>\njust isn&#39;t readily available. (Like putting out the information that  <br/>\nunschooled children learn to read without being taught because the  <br/>\nonly other information people have is from schools who have no clue  <br/>\nthat kids don&#39;t need taught.

That&#39;s its reason for  <br/>\nbeing. That&#39;s what Ren and Kelly liked about the lists they were on  <br/>\nand that&#39;s what they designed this list around. Information lists  <br/>\ntend to retain those who love information and those who come for  <br/>\nsupport drift away (or storm off because they think everyone is  <br/>\nmean!) So lists tend to become more and more the way they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere I a newbie using teach and learn interchangeably I&#39;d *want* to  <br/>\nknow there&#39;s a strong belief that seeing the differences between the  <br/>\ntwo words will help me think about unschooling clearer and help me  <br/>\nput it into practice. (And I get to turn the ideas over and think  <br/>\nabout them in lots of different ways, not just accept them!) That&#39;s  <br/>\nwhat I like about informational lists. When starting out I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed support. I needed was information on how to do it, help on  <br/>\ncleaning out the old ways of looking at things, help on building a  <br/>\nnew approach, help on clarifying new ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, unschooling is intuitive.

That&#39;s why people should try several lists to find one  <br/>\nwith the flavor they like.

Instead of just saying what you feel and think, you have to watch what you say because you might not phrase it quite right. Example being, when in one group, someone said they were taught to read at age 4, for example, and someone else replied with you weren&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; to read, you &quot;learned&quot; to read all on your own. True, but must we be so callous that we have to respond back with harsh criticism of what another says. In this case, I am not referring to the original responder to me but to the responder to her. And I realize that you were just defending me which I appreciate but I am able to defend myself if I feel that something didn&#39;t come across right through my post. <br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps alot to remember that people aren&#39;t directly replying to you. They are taking your words and ideas and replying to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen someone talks about &quot;teaching&quot; versus &quot;learning&quot; they are changing who the actor is. If I am taught something, I am passive to the experience, whereas when I learn something I am actively doing something. If someone masters reading and attributes it to their teacher it means that reading becomes something that can only be handed on to the next person. If someone masters reading and attributes that mastery to themselves, than reading is something that is part of the human experience and given the right environment is something that can be learned without needing to be instructed. It is a powerful and a key understanding for unschooling. It isn&#39;t just semantics, it isn&#39;t just being petty or mean or politically correct to work to get that piece of the philosophy across. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teaching/%c2%a0is\">http://sandradodd.com/teaching/%c2%a0is</a> a series of perspectives on why there is a discussion whenever teaching comes up.

Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about.

I suppose that I can help my daughter learn these things. I actually already do. She asks me to spell different words all the time or she tells me letters and asks me what they spell. I guess that since I went through public school, even though I like the idea of unschooling, I am still just a tiny tad bit skeptical that my children, especially the youngest, will be able to learn all she needs to. I do understand what you are saying though about who determines what my children need to learn or not learn. I guess that they will learn everything that they need to know all on their own. The problem being that society doesn&#39;t always agree with that. Society wants to see the diploma, the degree, or the certification.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my children have learned a lot of what you are calling &quot;the basics&quot; from a life without instruction or school. And they own it. They have this amazing knowledge that it didn&#39;t take someone else to give them knowledge, they got it by living and learning in the world at large. They don&#39;t have to believe that &quot;the basics&quot; were so complicated that they owe their understanding of them to someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote &quot;a lot&quot; rather than just &quot;the basics&quot; because they are still learning, always learning. They don&#39;t have to master one set of knowledge by some age and be judged as having completed that level well enough to move forward with the rest of the class. They get to wander and amble through the halls of knowledge skipping around and lingering wherever they want. They get to work to whatever proficiency they want to have and then find something else or move to the next tangent. It is truly an amazing thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote: <br/>\n&quot;I am still just a tiny tad bit skeptical that my children, especially the youngest, will be able to learn all she needs to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really hard to see a life that isn&#39;t filled with &quot;needs to&quot;. But life isn&#39;t all that full of them. So much of it is really &quot;chooses to&quot;. I&#39;m choosing to write this even though the landlord&#39;s representative is coming over for our 6 month checkup and there is still a bit of cleaning to be done. Neither is a &quot;needs to&quot; choice. Without the cleaning we wouldn&#39;t be kicked out, but it makes it easier for our relationship with our landlord. Without this e-mail my life would be just as full, but there are things I want to say, so here I am. Reading and writing and &#39;rithmatic aren&#39;t in themselves &quot;needs tos&quot;, they are tools to access other things. They are different ways of exploring the world. I have two children who have read at very different ages. Linnaea, my daughter, began reading at 5. Simon, my son, began reading at 11 or just 12. His fluency has come on much more slowly than Linnaea&#39;s did. But that may have more to do with the material he is working<br/>\n to read than it does with his fluency. Having Simon not read until later really showed me how much reading narrows your vision. He sees things that I don&#39;t even look for. If there are written instructions, I read those first before looking at something. Simon looks and explores and then may ask what the words say. He listens so much better than I do. And he remembers. Reading works as blinders in some ways. And early reading is only really a good skill when others aren&#39;t there and willing to help you to get access to information that is reading only. For schools that&#39;s pivotal. When you have a classroom of 20 to 30 children, having them all be able to work on their own and read the material to themselves is really key. But when you have a lower child to adult ratio, when you have a parent and their children, reading early is far less important to the adult. And, as Ren Allen has written, I don&#39;t know any adult unschoolers who are illiterate. But I know<br/>\n a lot of adults who were schooled who hate to read or who are afraid of math. This drive to force people to learn what the state believes are &quot;needs to&quot; know things destroys the curiousity and joy in learning that people start with. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: more questions from a newbie","postDate":"1250029395","msgId":40977,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg1c3IwaituZzNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg1cXBlaCthM3E3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40976,"nextInTopic":40978,"prevInTime":40976,"nextInTime":40978,"topicId":40935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~Under the law the children in these programs ...

Anyone in TN who uses a cover school is listed as a &quot;private schooled&quot; not a homeschooler. The classifications have to do with government and do not necessarily have anything to do with how/what you choose to do in your home.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, when we first started homeschooling in WA state in &#39;95-<br/>\n96, we signed up with a cyber school called &quot;Home-link&quot;. It&#39;s changed a lot since we were there, but at the time it was run completely by homeschool parents and kids. We could sign up for 1-3 classes per week (maximum) and learn things like computer, sign language, gardening, music etc... the classes being decided by whomever had something to share and willing to run it. I was set to teach a music/art class but then we chose to move.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe weren&#39;t unschoolers, but the school would have worked for unschoolers because it was completely and entirely up to the kids and parents what they wanted to learn. If you didn&#39;t like a class you could leave at any time. If you wanted to learn something you could get a class started. There were quite a few mainstream types there but overall it was very, very  eclectic and swirly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were classified as &quot;public school&quot;. Even though my kids were home with me and we took a couple of classes each term, we weren&#39;t labeled as homeschoolers.

Not all Cyber schools are public school curriculum done at home. Not at all. What JJ is referring to (I believe...correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is the very divisive document that the Hegeners were very supportive of, saying that if anyone used ANY cyber school or public school funds of ANY kind, they were not homeschoolers. It was a poorly worded document and caused a lot of irritation and grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to read my take on it, you can go to the discussions from the very beginning of this list, when Helen used to be a member here and weighed in with her opinion. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is at home, doing any kind of education it is homeschooling in my opinion. It matters not one whit whether they are using public school curriculum or not. Do I think that&#39;s a great way to educate? NO. Do I think it&#39;s confusing? Somewhat...sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know of cyber schools and public funds in which the parents and children still have complete control over how they want to use it and what they learn. In Alaska, there are many schools that give the homeschooling parents money for supplies and don&#39;t require it be curriculum at ALL. My sister bought a ton of cool, fun books and bikes/trampoline etc...for her children through one of the programs for years. According to that document the Hegeners signed, my sister was not a homeschooler even though her kids NEVER used any kind of curriculum nor stepped foot in a school. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s divisive and unecessary. <br/>\nHomeschooling is school at home. I don&#39;t care for school at home but you could still consider it all homeschooling regardless of the curriculum. Unschooling is a whole other ball-o-wax and that&#39;s what we need to stick with discussing anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just figured a lot of folks may not know about some of the divisiveness that has sprung up around this issue and not realize how people want to turn this into a black and white when it&#39;s very grey.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think most of the time homeschoolers of all kinds are better off not taking money from the government because you slowly get more and more erosion of your freedom. Are you still a homeschooler just because you use some of those funds?

I was merely stating that my mother and sister are opposed to unschooling. I just wanted to know what information I could give them to make them understand that this is what is best for my kids. Also, I am a single mom so I have no spouse to have any say. My ex-husband passed away last year, he was the father of my oldest two children. My youngest daughter&#39;s father and I were never married. He is not in her life at all so I am the only one making the decisions. Hence, why I still respect my mother&#39;s and sister&#39;s thoughts but I still get to make the final decision on my own.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:***You can educate your children at home in all 50 states. You may educate them in any way that that works for your family, including unschooling. Different states have difference accountability laws. Some states are tougher than others. States like NV are very easy and places like PA and NY have a lot of hurdles...BUT it is still possible to follow your heart and allow your children to follow theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I realize that you can homeschool in all 50 states. I said that I didn&#39;t remember what I read but that for some reason I thought that it would be more difficult to homeschool in Ohio. I can&#39;t cite what I read because I don&#39;t recall where I read it now. However, I have read more now and have found all the steps that I need to take in order to satisfy the state&#39;s &quot;legal&quot; requirements for homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:***These sound like cyber schools?

I never claimed that these online public schools had anything to do with homeschooling, you did.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:***That all sounds like you are on the right track for what works for your<br/>\n<br/>\nfamily. Unschooling would be taking that a few steps further.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of using NAScar to &quot;teach&quot; your son things, unschooling would have<br/>\n<br/>\nyou supporting your sons interest in NAScar without using it as teachable<br/>\n<br/>\nmoments or to fit your agenda. He will learn from his interests (everyone<br/>\n<br/>\ndoes!). But the focus would be on his enjoyment of NAScar as a whole rather<br/>\n<br/>\nthan breaking interests down in to neat little subject areas, like math,<br/>\n<br/>\nreading or history. Through a natural exploration of a passion (NAScar) he<br/>\n<br/>\nwill likely tough on everything you can think of an more. It will (joyfully)<br/>\n<br/>\nlead him on to other thoughts and ideas and places/things to explore. He<br/>\n<br/>\nwill love his life and learn. Because that what humans do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:*** I have grown to apply unschooling thought to my whole life. Why do you need to go to school to explore this subject at all? You can study death in a variety of ways that may interest you more than fulfilling someone else&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nrequirements. Can you just take the online courses you want and scrap the<br/>\n<br/>\nrest? If you are looking for a certain job that requires a certain credintial than explore it further. I have had any job I have ever wanted. AND I am a high school drop out. I am also an autodidact. I have learned everything I need to on my own. I can figure out ways to help others understand what I know and how I can be an asset to them. You can too, we all can.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I would love to take the online courses as you have suggested but if you read my post you would have seen that financial aid will not cover taking the online courses. I do not have the resources to pay for these courses. If I go to Kent State, I qualify for financial aid to cover everything. I would love to get any job that I have ever wanted. However, I wonder how you have done so. When they ask where you learned whatever you needed in order to do the job, and you told them that you just learned it &quot;on your own&quot;, are you telling me that they just hired you on the spot? I find it hard to believe that a business will hire someone that says they learned the trade or whatever on their own without having a degree or certification of some sort. I am not saying that it is right. You may know just as much as the next guy that went to college. I am just saying that I find it hard to believe. If I could get whatever job I wanted without having to go to college, I probably would have done it by now. Please tell me how I can do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:***It would help you to clarify it. Why do you fear that your 7 year old<br/>\n<br/>\nwill never learn the &quot;basics&quot;? Write it out. Examine it and see if it is<br/>\n<br/>\nreally the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ As I said above, I am considering the basics to be reading, writing, and basic math. I suppose that I can help my daughter learn these things. I actually already do. She asks me to spell different words all the time or she tells me letters and asks me what they spell. I guess that since I went through public school, even though I like the idea of unschooling, I am still just a tiny tad bit skeptical that my children, especially the youngest, will be able to learn all she needs to. I do understand what you are saying though about who determines what my children need to learn or not learn. I guess that they will learn everything that they need to know all on their own.

It might help to get yourself to an unschooling gathering or conference. See, meet and chat with REAL LIVE unschoolers. You can see for yourself the depth and intelligence of these amazing children who parents support and nurture their passions without controlling it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ I did say in my post that I live in Ohio. Quite frankly though, I&#39;m not sure if I want to go to a gathering or conference because it seems that, from reading a lot of these posts, that a lot of unschooling parents only see things from their perspective. And although I appreciate that perspective seeing as I want to know why I should unschool, I also don&#39;t like being knocked for things that I may or may not agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOP:***I am thinking that you are taking this a little too seriously, to where you are working yourself up a little. Ask yourself... How would supporting and<br/>\n<br/>\nrespecting your children and helping them find joyous ways to live and love<br/>\n<br/>\nlife be detrimental? Unschooling is about connecting, exploring, enjoying,<br/>\n<br/>\nloving, respecting, passion, these things are not going to hurt anyone.

I also never claimed to be homeschooling my children when I said that they attended online school. I did say that I homeschooled my son in NC for a year before moving back to Ohio. I then said that my son went to the online school, Connections Academy for the next almost 3 years when he switched to Buckeye Online School for Success in March 2009. I also said that my oldest daughter went to the local public school until December of 2008 when she switched to BOSS. I know that both of these online schools are considered public schools.

Instead of just saying what you feel and think, you have to watch what you say because you might not phrase it quite right. Example being, when in one group, someone said they were taught to read at age 4, for example, and someone else replied with you weren&#39;t &quot;taught&quot; to read, you &quot;learned&quot; to read all on your own. True, but must we be so callous that we have to respond back with harsh criticism of what another says. In this case, I am not referring to the original responder to me but to the responder to her. And I realize that you were just defending me which I appreciate but I am able to defend myself if I feel that something didn&#39;t come across right through my post. <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, I had someone respond to a post of mine by criticizing me for saying &quot;you&#39;ll never use this, I didn&#39;t&quot; just as an example of the things that schools are teaching my children that they don&#39;t care about or want to learn. I never said that it pertained to everything or that I wouldn&#39;t support my children if they did want to learn it. Wow! I just wanted a few answers to my questions about unschooling and now I am just feeling the tension in these groups, that I&#39;m not so sure that I&#39;d want to go meet anyone, for fear of what I might say that would not be considered &quot;unschooling&quot; talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do appreciate all of the advice and suggestions.

She will be entering second grade at the local public<br/>\nelementary school. I&#39;m debating whether I want to unschool her as well.<br/>\nPart of me feels like it is the right thing to do but the other part of<br/>\nme is worried that I will not be able to help her learn the basics. You<br/>\nguys think that my mom and sister freaked over my two older children,<br/>\nwait until they hear that I&#39;m thinking of unschooling my youngest! LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Unschooling while still a verb is also a mindset. What are you thinking<br/>\nof as &quot;the basics&quot;? You write about it as though there is a set of knowledge<br/>\nthat every single person needs. If there is such a body of knowledge that is<br/>\nso important to us all then why would it be unfathomable for her to pick up<br/>\nup through life and through a joyous existence? If it is something so basic<br/>\nthat everyone needs to know it then you *should* know it, that would make<br/>\nyou qualified to share your knowledge with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t believe that such a body of knowledge exists. I am<br/>\nconfident that my children can and will learn everything *they* need to be<br/>\nsuccessful and happy on the life path they chose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, why are you allowing your sister to have a say in how you parent? They<br/>\nare your children. You don&#39;t have to answer to anyone, though your spouse<br/>\nhas some say :-)<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: My son, the 14 year old, started homeschooling in the 5th grade. It was<br/>\nhis choice. At first, I was against it but then I read all about<br/>\nhomeschooling and the more I read, the more it made sense. I made up<br/>\nthe curriculum myself that year. We lived in North Carolina at the<br/>\ntime. We then moved back to our home state of Ohio and for some reason<br/>\nI thought that it was going to be more difficult to homeschool. I don&#39;t<br/>\nremember what I read at the time but I didn&#39;t think I could homeschool<br/>\nwithout a lot of hassle from the system so I enrolled him in the online<br/>\nschool Connections Academy. He was at CA for 6th, 7th, and most of 8th<br/>\ngrade.<br/>\n<br/>\n***You can educate your children at home in all 50 states. You may educate<br/>\nthem in any way that that works for your family, including unschooling.<br/>\nDifferent states have difference accountability laws. Some states are<br/>\ntougher than others. States like NV are very easy and places like PA and NY<br/>\nhave a lot of hurdles...BUT it is still possible to follow your heart and<br/>\nallow your children to follow theirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: My oldest daughter, 16, attended public school all the way until half<br/>\nway through her 10th grade year by her choice. She then decided that<br/>\nshe&#39;d like to try the online school but she didn&#39;t want to go to CA.<br/>\nShe had heard about a school called Buckeye Online School for Success<br/>\nfrom a friend so she started there in December 2008. My son wasn&#39;t<br/>\nhappy with CA so he switched to BOSS as well in March of 2009 to finish<br/>\nout his 8th grade school year.<br/>\n<br/>\n***These sound like cyber schools? That is public school online. That isn&#39;t<br/>\neven homeschool though physically your children are at home. They are<br/>\naccountable to<br/>\nthe public school system.<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOP: In the end, neither one of them was happy with what they were learning.<br/>\nAnd whenever I helped them, I didn&#39;t quite understand why they had to<br/>\nlearn some of the things that they were learning. I&#39;d tell them &quot;you&#39;re<br/>\nnever going to use this, I never did&quot;. So many useless things memorized<br/>\njust to pass a test so the system can say that we are learning as we<br/>\nshould be. I did well in school but that is all I did, memorized things<br/>\nto pass the test, and then forgot them. The only things that I<br/>\nremembered were the things important to me. Well, those and some other<br/>\nuseless facts. I said to my sister the other day that if someone asked<br/>\nme who the 10th President of the United States was, I could tell them<br/>\nthat it was John Tyler but who really cares. Unless I was going on to<br/>\nbe a historian or a history teacher, etc., then who really cares if I<br/>\nknow some meaningless historical facts. I think that my son did best<br/>\nthe year in NC that I homeschooled. I made up math lessons<br/>\nincorporating his favorite sport, Nascar racing. He loved that! Reading<br/>\nand writing consisted of more of Nascar, as well as other things he was<br/>\ninterested in such as music, guitar playing, bicycle repair, etc. He<br/>\ndid so much better when learning about things that he liked than being<br/>\nforced to learn. We even went to Lowe&#39;s Motor Speedway (an hour from us<br/>\nat the time) and to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (about 30 to 40 minutes away<br/>\nfrom us). And I also worked at Doug Herbert Performance (he&#39;s a<br/>\ndragster) for a while so my son got to learn and see first hand about<br/>\nthe world of racing which our whole family loves.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That all sounds like you are on the right track for what works for your<br/>\nfamily. Unschooling would be taking that a few steps further.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of using NAScar to &quot;teach&quot; your son things, unschooling would have<br/>\nyou supporting your sons interest in NAScar without using it as teachable<br/>\nmoments or to fit your agenda. He will learn from his interests (everyone<br/>\ndoes!). But the focus would be on his enjoyment of NAScar as a whole rather<br/>\nthan breaking interests down in to neat little subject areas, like math,<br/>\nreading or history. Through a natural exploration of a passion (NAScar) he<br/>\nwill likely tough on everything you can think of an more. It will (joyfully)<br/>\nlead him on to other thoughts and ideas and places/things to explore. He<br/>\nwill love his life and learn. Because that what humans do.<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am starting Kent State at the end of this month. I am not<br/>\ntaking my first choice. I wanted to take Thanatology but that is not<br/>\noffered at any Ohio school. The closest school that I could find<br/>\noffering it was in Maryland. My other choice would be to take an online<br/>\ncourse in Thanatology. However, I can not get financial aid for the<br/>\nonline course. So I have had to find a close substitution. I am going<br/>\nto be taking Sociology which covers way more than Thanatology but does<br/>\noffer one semester in it. I don&#39;t know what I want to do once I<br/>\ngraduate but I am just interested in both Thanatology and Sociology.<br/>\nThe problem that I have is all the extra courses that I &quot;must&quot; take in<br/>\norder to graduate. Why do I need 4 semesters of a foreign language? I&#39;m<br/>\nnot moving to another country. I took 3 years of Spanish in high school<br/>\nbecause I wanted to but now I don&#39;t want to, lol. Also, I have to take<br/>\nCollege Writing which I do like but don&#39;t find necessary to take as<br/>\nwell as music and history classes that have nothing to do with<br/>\nSociology. I just don&#39;t understand why we have to take all of these<br/>\nextra classes. But since I do want to learn about Sociology, I am<br/>\nmaking the &quot;choice&quot; to take all of these other required courses in<br/>\norder to graduate.<br/>\n<br/>\n*** I have grown to apply unschooling thought to my whole life. Why do you<br/>\nneed to go to school to explore this subject at all? You can study death in<br/>\na variety of ways that may interest you more than fulfilling someone else&#39;s<br/>\nrequirements. Can you just take the online courses you want and scrap the<br/>\nrest? If you are looking for a certain job that requires a certain<br/>\ncredintial than explore it further. I have had any job I have ever wanted.<br/>\nAND I am a high school drop out. I am also an autodidact. I have learned<br/>\neverything I need to on my own. I can figure out ways to help others<br/>\nunderstand what I know and how I can be an asset to them. You can too, we<br/>\nall can.<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I guess that I kind of got off topic there, lol. I tend to be<br/>\nvery long-winded as all the thoughts in my head come down my arms and<br/>\nthrough my fingers to the keyboard, lol. I guess what I am trying to<br/>\nsay above is that I feel that my older two learned the &quot;basics&quot; such as<br/>\nreading, writing, and basic math. I am worried that taking my 7 year<br/>\nold out of school now that she will have a harder time learning the<br/>\nbasics. Also, there is a part of me that is still trying to &quot;deschool&quot;<br/>\nmyself. I am feeling that it is &quot;wrong&quot; to take my 7 year old out of<br/>\nschool for some reason that I can&#39;t quite explain. But then there is<br/>\nanother part of me that is pulling me to do so just the same. I only<br/>\nwant to do what is best for all 3 of my children. I just don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake the wrong choice that may or may not have detrimental effects on<br/>\ntheir future. Any advice on what to do about my 7 year old attending<br/>\npublic school or being unschooled (or even homeschooled)??<br/>\n<br/>\n***It would help you to clarify it. Why do you fear that your 7 year old<br/>\nwill never learn the &quot;basics&quot;? Write it out. Examine it and see if it is<br/>\nreally the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do you live? It might help to get yourself to an unschooling gathering<br/>\nor conference. See, meet and chat with REAL LIVE unschoolers. You can see<br/>\nfor yourself the depth and intelligence of these amazing children who<br/>\nparents support and nurture their passions without controlling it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one in MA this month NorthEast Unschoolers Conference *<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/</a><br/>\n*There is one in September in MD Enjoy Life Unschooling Conference *<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/*\">http://enjoylifeunschooling.com/*</a><br/>\nThere are several others in other states almost every month! It is amazing<br/>\nhow absolutely life changing it is to see unschooling in action if you have<br/>\nnever experienced it before.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking that you are taking this a little too seriously, to where you<br/>\nare working yourself up a little. Ask yourself... How would supporting and<br/>\nrespecting your children and helping them find joyous ways to live and love<br/>\nlife be detrimental? Unschooling is about connecting, exploring, enjoying,<br/>\nloving, respecting, passion, these things are not going to hurt anyone. You<br/>\ncan&#39;t go wrong respecting your children.<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":330448208,"authorName":"KaitKalKenz3@aol.com","from":"KaitKalKenz3@...","profile":"kaitkalkenz3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: more questions from a newbie","postDate":"1249837263","msgId":40966,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDQkU3MkExRDI4RTdEQy1EODAtNDY4REBXRUJNQUlMLU1aMjkuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":40964,"nextInTopic":40967,"prevInTime":40965,"nextInTime":40967,"topicId":40935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I just wanted to thank everyone that has responded to my post.

Reading<br/>\nand writing consisted of more of Nascar, as well as other things he was<br/>\ninterested in such as music, guitar playing, bicycle repair, etc. He<br/>\ndid so much better when learning about things that he liked than being<br/>\nforced to learn. We even went to Lowe&#39;s Motor Speedway (an hour from us<br/>\nat the time) and to Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (about 30 to 40 minutes away<br/>\nfrom us). And I also worked at Doug Herbert Performance (he&#39;s a<br/>\ndragster) for a while so my son got to learn and see first hand about<br/>\nthe world of racing which our whole family loves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am starting Kent State at the end of this month. I am not<br/>\ntaking my first choice. I wanted to take Thanatology but that is not<br/>\noffered at any Ohio school. The closest school that I could find<br/>\noffering it was in Maryland. My other choice would be to take an online<br/>\ncourse in Thanatology. However, I can not get financial aid for the<br/>\nonline course. So I have had to find a close substitution. I am going<br/>\nto be taking Sociology which covers way more than Thanatology but does<br/>\noffer one semester in it. I don&#39;t know what I want to do once I<br/>\ngraduate but I am just interested in both Thanatology and Sociology.<br/>\nThe problem that I have is all the extra courses that I &quot;must&quot; take in<br/>\norder to graduate. Why do I need 4 semesters of a foreign language? I&#39;m<br/>\nnot moving to another country. I took 3 years of Spanish in high school<br/>\nbecause I wanted to but now I don&#39;t want to, lol. Also, I have to take<br/>\nCollege Writing which I do like but don&#39;t find necessary to take as<br/>\nwell as music and history classes that have nothing to do with<br/>\nSociology. I just don&#39;t understand why we have to take all of these<br/>\nextra classes. But since I do want to learn about Sociology, I am<br/>\nmaking the &quot;choice&quot; to take all of these other required courses in<br/>\norder to graduate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I guess that I kind of got off topic there, lol. I tend to be<br/>\nvery long-winded as all the thoughts in my head come down my arms and<br/>\nthrough my fingers to the keyboard, lol. I guess what I am trying to<br/>\nsay above is that I feel that my older two learned the &quot;basics&quot; such as<br/>\nreading, writing, and basic math. I am worried that taking my 7 year<br/>\nold out of school now that she will have a harder time learning the<br/>\nbasics. Also, there is a part of me that is still trying to &quot;deschool&quot;<br/>\nmyself. I am feeling that it is &quot;wrong&quot; to take my 7 year old out of<br/>\nschool for some reason that I can&#39;t quite explain. But then there is<br/>\nanother part of me that is pulling me to do so just the same. I only<br/>\nwant to do what is best for all 3 of my children. I just don&#39;t want to<br/>\nmake the wrong choice that may or may not have detrimental effects on<br/>\ntheir future. Any advice on what to do about my 7 year old attending<br/>\npublic school or being unschooled (or even homeschooled)??<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all of your advice with this matter. I really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ Ross","from":"&quot;JJ Ross&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re:more questions from a newbie","postDate":"1249699626","msgId":40964,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg1aW92YStpYTI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg1aG1mNStlMjJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40963,"nextInTopic":40966,"prevInTime":40963,"nextInTime":40965,"topicId":40935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Having just sent a child off to Europe with no tour group or adult planning whatsoever, for five weeks with a friend younger than SHE is, I can attest to the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-823557659\">Having just sent a child off to Europe with no tour group or adult planning whatsoever, for five weeks with a friend younger than SHE is, I can attest to the importance of Ren&#39;s wise words!

I sent him one homeschool link - A to Z&#39;s Home&#39;s cool (sorry, not at my regular computer so I don&#39;t have the book mark). Its a ginormous site, which I think calmed him down a good deal. <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge&#39;s mom and my Aunty (who doubles as a mom for me, since mine died before I ever had kids) were less antagonistic, so I&#39;ve offered them little bits of information here and there, as they seem interested.

We have parents with PhDs, parents who are self employed, parents who are anarchists living in busses. Some unschooled kids go to college, others don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n My partner never finished high school, but ran his own business until he was injured and had to change professions. Now he&#39;s a stay at home dad. I have a BS, but currently work in a factory. I&#39;ve yet to find a reason to go to grad school. One of the differences I tend to see between unschooling families and others is there&#39;s less of an attitude that a career is something permanent. My partner has changed careers a couple times, and so have I - and I expect to change at least two more times in my life, maybe more! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If you didn&#39;t get a GED, and didn&#39;t go to college either, what information have you been able to give to a perspective employer to prove that you are what they would consider &quot;educated&quot;?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>\n<br/>\nMy partner doesn&#39;t have a GED, either. They didn&#39;t ask for it when he got a business license ;) Homeschoolers can create their own diplomas, if necessary. Our umbrella school will provide one if Ray wants. If he goes on in metalworking, though, I don&#39;t suspect a diploma will be one of the really important questions he&#39;s asked. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t really considered the matter for Mo, yet, since she&#39;s only 7. She may take community college classes before she &quot;graduates&quot; or she may do some interning, or other kinds of work that can be used on transcripts. Right now she&#39;s interested in animal rescue, so I&#39;m looking for ways for her to do that Now - looking for shelters that need volunteers, for example. Colleges like that sort of thing, but that&#39;s not the point. SHE wants to do something important Right Now, not ten years from now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s another big difference with unschoolers (I&#39;ve been pointing this out to grandma and Aunty, too) - looking at what kids can do and are doing, Now, rather than thinking in terms of kid-life as preparation for adult life. Its ironic, but it seems to lead to kids being Better prepared for adult life. They don&#39;t have to spend a dozen years doing some kind of half-a..ed practice, they get to live real life right now. It makes a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I sent my sister a list of famous people that had been homeschooled, unschooled, or quit school that have gone on to do great things in their lives.

A whole lot of people just don&#39;t know anything but popular myths about homeschooling - much less unschooling! So if she&#39;s willing, send her little dribs and drabs about what homeschoolers in general are up to. Links to resources are good, too, for extended family. It gives them ideas for gifts that are &quot;educational&quot; which helps them feel connected to you and your kids. They&#39;re trying to connect and be helpful, they&#39;re just doing it badly! If connection is something you want, help them see that, even if they don&#39;t agree, this isn&#39;t something you&#39;ve made up, its not a weird cult, its not a disaster waiting to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 7, Ray 15)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":367169565,"authorName":"Melissa Gray","from":"Melissa Gray &lt;melissagr8@...&gt;","profile":"graymamacita","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] more questions from a newbie","postDate":"1249585888","msgId":40938,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2NzdBNzNGLUFEQkEtNERFNy1BNDNFLUQ0NkNEQ0I2MEJGQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg1ZXZtNSs3YTgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg1ZXZtNSs3YTgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":40935,"nextInTopic":40945,"prevInTime":40937,"nextInTime":40939,"topicId":40935,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sherri, There is absolutely nothing you can say to your mom or your sister that will change their minds.

I&#39;m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the first things I had to realize was that it didn&#39;t matter  <br/>\nwhat others thought, if seeking their approval was the way I lived my  <br/>\nlife, I wouldn&#39;t have my life (which I love BTW) With my family I  <br/>\nhave just told them that it&#39;s not up for discussion. It&#39;s not up for  <br/>\nnegotiations. These are the children I was given, and I am going to  <br/>\ndo what I feel is best for them. Not for my parents. Not for my  <br/>\nsiblings (esp my SIL, she has SUCH issues with homeschooling anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is short, I have a nursling who wants me right now. just wanted  <br/>\nto get in something short, sweet and to the point. You can&#39;t change  <br/>\nsomeone&#39;s mind. You can just live for yourself and your children and  <br/>\ntell them to pass the potatoes!<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Joshua, Breanna, Emily, Rachel, Samuel, Daniel, Avari, and  <br/>\nbaby Nathan!<br/>\nWife to Zane<br/>\n<br/>\nblog me at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/\">http://startlinglives.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com\">http://startlinglives365.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 6, 2009, at 11:17 AM, kaitkalkenz3 wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m sorry for being so long-winded, lol.

My mother and my sister are totally against unschooling. I&#39;ve tried to explain the benefits but they just don&#39;t see it. Every thing that I say, they come back with an answer to! What have you all told your family and friends when you decided to unschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have told my mom that I&#39;ve read a lot about unschooling and I&#39;ve asked questions in these groups. She asked me what everyone did for a living on here. I personally don&#39;t see what you do for a living has anything to do with unschooling your children. I think that she may have meant &quot;what have the unschoolers gone on to do as far as careers go?&quot;. Have any of you been unschooled yourself? If so, how many of you went on to college? If so, how many of you got a GED? If not, how did you get accepted to college? If you didn&#39;t get a GED, and didn&#39;t go to college either, what information have you been able to give to a perspective employer to prove that you are what they would consider &quot;educated&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that my mom&#39;s and my sister&#39;s biggest concern is that my children won&#39;t be able to go on to college or get a &quot;good&quot; job if they don&#39;t get a high school diploma. I tried to tell them that I&#39;ve got a high school diploma and I&#39;ve only been asked to show it to an employer once in the past 20 years that I&#39;ve been out of school. My sister has a GED so I don&#39;t know why she even has a right to say anything. She quit school when she was 17 and got her GED. She didn&#39;t homeschool or unschool. She just quit. But now, she decided to go back to school a few years ago and she just graduated summa cum laude with highest honors from Kent State last March with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree majoring in English and minoring in Writing. Now, she is a graduate student going for her Master&#39;s Degree in Liberal Arts concentrating on Women&#39;s Studies. Look at all that she has done without a high school diploma! I&#39;m so proud of her. But isn&#39;t it hypocritical of her to not agree about my children being unschooled when she didn&#39;t finish &quot;traditional&quot; high school either? And she has gone on to do a lot with only a GED!<br/>\n<br/>\nI sent my sister a list of famous people that had been homeschooled, unschooled, or quit school that have gone on to do great things in their lives. She didn&#39;t respond to my e-mail, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that my mom just wants to know what any of you, as unschoolers, or if any of your grown children, if you have grown children, that were unschooled have gone on to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister keeps going on about how everyone that she works with at Kent is against homeschooling. She went on to tell me that her boss has a PhD. Well, la de da! I told her that I was proud of her boss&#39;s accomplishments but maybe my children don&#39;t want a PhD! My son is also in a rock band. He&#39;s played two &quot;real&quot; gigs so far and has two more scheduled this fall. He&#39;s really excited and I&#39;m so proud of him and his bandmates. My sister told me that she talked to a guy she works with that used to want to be a &quot;rock star&quot; and that he said that the chance of making it was a long shot. I told her that my son and I realize that. But I bet that was also said to all the great bands out there like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, etc. If they would have listened to everyone else&#39;s doubts, they wouldn&#39;t have made it. My son knows that he may not make it &quot;big&quot; but he&#39;s doing what he enjoys and he also has two other big interests to fall back on if the music doesn&#39;t work out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for being so long-winded, lol. I guess I just basically want to know what I can say to my mom and my sister to convince them that this is the best option for my children?
