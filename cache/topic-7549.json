I DO think parents ought to  <br/>\nlet kids know when they&#39;re being discourteous  and actually talk to  <br/>\nthem about why courtesy is useful in lubricating social interactions  <br/>\nand so on. In other words, I think my kids (who are generally very  <br/>\nwell-mannered) learned mostly from just living with parents who  <br/>\nbehaved with good manners, but I do think there are times for  <br/>\ndiscussions AND times to bring things directly to kids&#39; attention.  <br/>\nAnd I do not think parents should let kids be really disruptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child IS being rude, for example, in a restaurant, and  <br/>\ndisturbing other customers - I would not punish the child, no hand- <br/>\nslapping, no verbal reprimand (how many times have we seen parents  <br/>\nbeing INCREDIBLY rude in telling their kids not to BE rude?). But I&#39;d  <br/>\nsay, &quot;Honey, that wasn&#39;t polite, it is bothering other customers.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd if a child kept it up, I&#39;d take him/her outside to run around a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting that parents do the &quot;Go tell Mrs. Brown thank  <br/>\nyou,&quot; routine so much as giving information such as &quot;Mrs. Brown would  <br/>\nprobably like it if you thanked her.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even with much older kids, there are times they just don&#39;t think/ <br/>\nrealize what effect they might be having on others. So it isn&#39;t  <br/>\noften, but occasionally I might STILL say, &quot;So-and-so went to a lot  <br/>\nof work for you, did you thank her enough?&quot;  And I might point out to  <br/>\nthem how other people&#39;s lack of manners impacts how people respond to  <br/>\nthem - point out how people are more eager to do things for those who  <br/>\nshow their gratitude, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - be careful that you&#39;re not misleading your husband into thinking  <br/>\nthat radical unschooling is so hands off that we withhold information  <br/>\nand expect kids to learn ONLY from our modeling.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":201952787,"authorName":"polykow","from":"&quot;polykow&quot; &lt;polykow@...&gt;","profile":"polykow","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] A Few Issues","postDate":"1131227109","msgId":7555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWM1ZTI1MiQzNzE0NGM4MCQzYjYyOWYwNEBwYXZpbGlvbj4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMS41NmEyM2Y3Yy4zMDllNzY4MUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7552,"nextInTopic":7558,"prevInTime":7554,"nextInTime":7556,"topicId":7549,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I agree with the book recomendation.

Make it easy for them<br/>\nto do the right thing.  Be with them and help them to make good choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my children were small they loved baths.  As they go older, it became<br/>\nmore of a chore to have a bath because the bath took time out from other fun<br/>\nthings. My kids can get away with a bath every 5 to 7 days now without<br/>\nsmelling noticably bad or having hair so tangly that it is a pain.  They can<br/>\ngo longer in the summer when we swim often.  The best motivation to bathe<br/>\nhas come from smelling other people who need a bath.  :)  They don&#39;t want to<br/>\nsmell that bad and I warn them when they are getting kind of ripe.  As much<br/>\nas they&#39;d rather not bathe, they rather not smell bad even worse, so they<br/>\nbathe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTeeth brushing was never a big issue for us. When the kids didn&#39;t want to do<br/>\nit, I just brought the brush to them and did it for them where ever they<br/>\nwere playing.  It wasn&#39;t so much that they didn&#39;t want clean teeth as it was<br/>\nthat they didn&#39;t want to take the time out to brush them.<br/>\n<br/>\nManners...hmm.  Kids really learn these by example.  If you are polite, your<br/>\nchildren will learn to be polite.  It drives me nuts now when people<br/>\ninterupt kids to tell them to say please or thank you, even though I did it<br/>\nwhen my kids were small. (I&#39;ve learned a lot) You can ask something nicely<br/>\nwithout saying please.  Just the other day dh told one of the kids to say<br/>\nplease even though they asked for something quite politely.  But he didn&#39;t<br/>\nsay thank you after eating the dinner I cooked and served.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223965924,"authorName":"Andrea L.
