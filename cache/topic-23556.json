Buffet-style resaurants would be <br/>\na good option for the child in the OP - he can take as many <br/>\nplates/silverware as he needs without going into &quot;employee space&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They also hate it when kids run around in a restaurant <br/>\n&gt; unsupervised while the parents are totally oblivious to what their <br/>\n </span></blockquote>kids are <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; doing. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t about being &quot;totally oblivious to what...kids are <br/>\ndoing,&quot; though. Its about being engaged with and responsive to our <br/>\nchildrens&#39; needs and passions. I always expect to do a certain <br/>\namount of exploring at a restaurant *with* my younger child. That <br/>\nway I can help her stay out of the way of employees, while answering <br/>\nher questions and pointing out items of interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the few occasions we&#39;ve gone to fancier restaurants with <br/>\nrelatives we&#39;ve called ahead and explained that we&#39;ll be dining with <br/>\na young child - do they have a more secluded table, out of the flow <br/>\nof traffic so we can bring a few toys to keep her occupied? <br/>\nRestaurants meals can be dull for children, so being proactive helps <br/>\nthings go more smoothly for everyone (kid, parents, staff).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Do yourself a favor though and give your son some <br/>\n&gt; structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The good news with unschooling is that chaos and structure are not <br/>\nthe only options. I&#39;ve found it most helpful, wrt finding other <br/>\noptions, to change my expectations about resaurant eating. Its not <br/>\ngoing to be the same with a younger child as it is with a group of <br/>\nadults. *I&#39;m* not going to be able to kick back and let someone else <br/>\ndo all the work - I&#39;ll be helping my kid understand the environment, <br/>\nan understanding that includes the needs of the wait-staff. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":295439124,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;wisdom1133@...&gt;","profile":"hammy454","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Silverware example","postDate":"1178333224","msgId":23557,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGYxZ3I3OCtrNmh0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGYxZ280ZytrbHJ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23556,"nextInTopic":23558,"prevInTime":23556,"nextInTime":23558,"topicId":23556,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Take a deep breath- it is ok for your kids to do things within reason that may bother you and others but IS okay.
