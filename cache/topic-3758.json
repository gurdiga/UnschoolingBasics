Your son and dh are allergic to cats, and the limited effect of the current cat is likely to increase as their bodies&#39; resistance to the cat&#39;s dander increases. This was my experience with our rats: When we first got them, I could cuddle them all day long with no problem. After we&#39;d had them for a while, they made me wheeze just as much as cats do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso--although I really hate being the big meanie who says it--do it sooner rather than later. After we gave away our cats (before we got the rats), it took a couple of years for all the dander to work its way out of the house. (The rat dander took less time because it was contained to one room.) But now, my asthma is basically gone. I only need my inhalers when I visit people who have pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with a tough decision.<br/>\nRonnie<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/\">http://sites.google.com/site/dragonflykaizen/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224673445,"authorName":"staceywhetstone@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;staceywhetstone@...&quot; &lt;staceywhetstone@...&gt;","profile":"staceywhetstone@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Asthma","postDate":"1258288045","msgId":42066,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhkb3MzZCt0bGYzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwMTY5MC4zNjA3Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MDQwOC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":42053,"nextInTopic":42071,"prevInTime":42065,"nextInTime":42067,"topicId":3758,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Any suggestions on keeping the cat and keeping my son healthy?

Or, should we get rid of the cat? <br/>\n<br/>\nSingulair has been a life saver for us.  When my son (6) was around 2 or 3 he became ill and we spent a night with him coughing so much he caused himself to throw up.  We took him to the doctor and his doctor gave him a breathing treatment at his office.  He sent us home with a prescription for Singulair daily and also sent a nebulizer machine with Xopenex and Pulmicort for when he has flare ups.  He told us that more than likely our son would grow out of his problem.  The Asthmatic problem that is.  He will most likely always suffer from allergies that is if he stays in East Tennessee where we live because this area seems to be prone to have allergens especially in Spring and Fall.  Now thankfully, we have not had to use the nebulizer for sometime but we are still taking the Singulair which seems to manage his symptoms nicely.  We have two dogs in the house as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.  I know how scary it can be to see your child not being able to breathe properly.

Her first hospitalization was before she was on any medication and directly after we had the floors steam cleaned. Her second hospitalization was after we had the vents in the house cleaned.  So we&#39;re living with slightly dirty floors and dusty vents :-)  Just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first started our asthma journey she hated taking her daily meds.  We worked with the doctor and got a daily steroid that could be used in the nebulizer.  We gave her the medication through a mask after she had gone to sleep.  That way, she got her medication, but it wasn&#39;t anything that caused annoyance or discomfort on her part.  I also offer her Flovent several times a day until she meets her daily dose. Her sister is awesome in keeping the mood light when Zoe needs to take her meds.  We&#39;ve &quot;given&quot; the meds to dolls and stuffed animals too. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve acquired a pulse oximeter to measure how much oxygen she&#39;s getting.  It gives me a huge sense of security to know that, even if she sounds horrible (wheezing & coughing) that she&#39;s still getting plenty of oxygen. It also helps me determine when to bring her into the ER or doctor&#39;s office. We&#39;ve also worked out a plan with our doctor to use prednisone under certain circumstances without taking her to the ER first. The people at the ER have been wonderful, but it is still scary & disruptive & we like to avoid it if we can.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes her longer to get over colds - a flare up can keep us close to<br/>\nhome for a month (1 week where she&#39;s getting sick. 1 week where she&#39;s<br/>\nactually sick. 1 week for recovery. And 1 week because I&#39;m still<br/>\nfreaking out a little).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a cat who is over ten years old.  We bought a rabbit shortly before we decided to move to Oregon (oh, about 45 minutes before the option became available, lol). We added a now 10 month old puppy about 5 months ago. Zoe doesn&#39;t have reactions to any of our animals. If she did, we&#39;d find new homes for them. When Auggie (our cat) passes on, we likely won&#39;t replace him (although I am a huge cat lover and would have 4!). If I&#39;d known we were moving, I wouldn&#39;t have added the rabbit (although he&#39;s an awesome pet!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMegan (8) is a big animal lover.  She started volunteering at a no-kill animal shelter almost a year ago.  We go weekly to socialize cats.  She is slightly reactive to cats (if she pets a cat, it is best if she doesn&#39;t rub her eyes), but Zoe is not. So we all get our cat/kitten fix every week.  Megan also has asthma, but it is extremely mild.  If either of the kids have a cold or cough, we skip the cat shelter than week as a precaution.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve looked into getting dust mite covers for the beds.  I&#39;ve read that magnesium, Zinc,Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and omega 3&#39;s can be helpful in alleviating asthma symptoms, but that is new information to me and I haven&#39;t had time to research it. I&#39;ve also wondered if adding foods that are supposed to have anti-inflammatory properties would help? Not in an &quot;eat this now&quot; kind of way.  More like making sure those types of foods are part of our regular options.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s asthma is much worse (and also non-existent in NM).  I don&#39;t clean or vacuum when he is home if I can avoid it. He&#39;s going to see an allergist next week to determine if there is anything that might be a trigger for him.  Zoe saw an allergist about a year ago and we know she is allergic to peanuts.  We&#39;ve opted not to do another test for awhile because it involves drawing blood and the allergist is satisfied with her previous skin prick test.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsthma is going to be a part of her life for now, but I don&#39;t want it to be any bigger than it needs to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Fri, 11/13/09, sharon &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:1drflmthr@...\">1drflmthr@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions on alternative ways to treat asthma?

They all seemed to cause problems for son and hubby. Finally, in August, we got a kitten. She does seem to cause some problems for my son and hubby, but not severe. She is band from going into my son&#39;s room and our family bedroom. Any suggestions on keeping the cat and keeping my son healthy? Or, should we get rid of the cat? <br/>\nSharon</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Asthma","postDate":"1098124956","msgId":3759,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE4MTg0MjM0Lk9TRkMxODQ1NC5tdGExMC5hZGVscGhpYS5uZXRAbGVpZ2g+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDE4MTgwNTQzLkVWV1QyMzQ4LmltZjIwYWVjLm1haWwuYmVsbHNvdXRoLm5ldEBtYWlsLmJlbGxzb3V0aC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":3758,"nextInTopic":42037,"prevInTime":3758,"nextInTime":3760,"topicId":3758,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Our homes are becoming our illness.

Most of our newer homes (built from the 1980&#39;s til now) are so air tight that they don&#39;t breathe.  We recycle the same air over and over.  This is why mold is becoming such an issue.  Since houses don&#39;t breathe, water gets caught in the house and creates a problem.  Our houses are more energy efficient, but they are making us ill.  This is primarily why I looked for an older house when we were house hunting.  I wanted something that wasn&#39;t shrunk wrapped.  My allergies and asthma has greatly improved since moving here and my son has only had one asthmatic episode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived in a spanking brand new house when we lived in Oregon and I was sick all the time.  I never associated it with my house until just a few years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46514,"nextTopicId":46554}}
