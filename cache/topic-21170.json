Wild <br/>\ncarrots don&#39;t taste very good and are only edible (if you can even call it <br/>\nthat)  when they&#39;re very young and tender.   The beautiful Queen Anne&#39;s Lace <br/>\nis the flower of the wild carrot.  If you go into your local florists shop <br/>\nyou might find it there.  I have a gangly bunch of it shedding tiny petals <br/>\non my table right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCarrots won&#39;t overwinter in my part of the country but I know some gardeners <br/>\nwho dig the roots and store them just so they can have their own seeds.
