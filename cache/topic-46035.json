Clearly, there are many differing interpretations.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The fundamental basis of unschooling is the idea that people (including children) learn as a natural result of living life, that while people may choose to be taught, learning does not require teaching. Motivation to learn is an essential part of our human nature. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help, when the lists get off on tangents and people start describing what will help unschooling, to go back and touch base with that fundamental. Kids don&#39;t &quot;need to learn&quot; kids learn, by nature. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a handy page of principles which help learning here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles\">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; read that there is nothing wrong with having all sorts of activities  <br/>\n&gt; planned, and so I wonder, how is this different from school at home?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What is the purpose of all those activities? Is it to entice your child to learn or to support that natural drive toward exploration and discovery? If &quot;activities&quot; are set out/planned with a specific agenda or expectation, that&#39;s a kind of school at home - there&#39;s an underlying curriculum in mom&#39;s head, even if she&#39;s winging the details. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe get a catalog from Dover books regularly, and order things now and then. Mo likes to look at catalogs, and sometimes will go through and circle things. As I have the money, I&#39;ll go through and get things she wants, but I&#39;ll also look and see if there are other things she might like. This last time I got her a book on hand shadow games since she enjoys that kind of fun. Last night I pointed out an article in National Geographic about dinosaur feathers because she likes dinosaurs and also recently watched a BBC series about birds. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You also said that some define unschooling at giving a child freedom -  <br/>\n&gt; and that this is different from the radical unschooling... Is this  <br/>\n&gt; because in this other definition of unschooling, the parent&#39;s comfort  <br/>\n&gt; zone is not being stretched?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it has more to do with the fact that &quot;freedom&quot; is a pretty vague term! It can mean anything from &quot;the blue sweater or the red one&quot; to &quot;tear down the house, I don&#39;t care.&quot; It&#39;s not a very useful word. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearning happens best when a person is choosing what to focus on, what to learn. So it&#39;s helpful to set kids up with things from which to choose, *and* it&#39;s helpful to get out of the way and let them choose, *and* it&#39;s helpful to be engaged and involved in whatever manner is comfortable/fun for your child. REcently Mo has been building motorized K&#39;nex kits and sometimes needs help getting all the bits to line up right so the thing will actually work. That&#39;s not &quot;giving her freedom&quot; in the sense of stepping back, it&#39;s helping her get what she wants. Similarly, the other day Ray wanted to cook something in the crock-pot but didn&#39;t realize how Long it would take to cook - so I let him know that his stew wouldn&#39;t be done in time for dinner if he did it that way. That wasn&#39;t &quot;giving him freedom&quot; or even letting him choose what to learn, it was offering him a valuable piece of information out of kindness. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in both those examples you can see that relationship issues play a big part in learning - and that&#39;s why discussions of radical unschooling (unschooling at its most fundamental) often focus on the relationship. When parents are kind and thoughtful, learning flows more freely. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have heard unschooling be described as &#39;Saturday afternoon in  <br/>\n&gt; July&#39;.

That unschooling is giving  <br/>\nkids as much<br/>\nfreedom as a parent can comfortably bear?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler covered that but I have heard others describe unschooling as  <br/>\ngiving children full freedom. I think that&#39;s very misleading.<br/>\n<br/>\nA *piece* of unschooling is providing a rich environment where kids  <br/>\ncan explore their interests and discover new interests. But that puts  <br/>\nthe parents in the background as providers of the environment. Parents  <br/>\nshould be<br/>\n<br/>\nA bigger piece of unschooling is parents -- though usually mom --  <br/>\nbeing connected to the kids. Being with them to know who they are,  <br/>\nunderstand enough about their interests to participate or at least  <br/>\nhave a conversation, to see the world through their eyes. An  <br/>\nunschooling parent has chosen unschooling because she want to be her  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s partner in their explorations.

It&#39;s not what you see or how it looks but what it feels like inside and how you think about it. Here&#39;s some (hopefully not tedious) personal snapshots in which I see the difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you part of an organized whirlwind European tour packed with predigested group activities all planned out by professionals and paid for in a lump sum and you just sign up and then do as you&#39;re told, stay on schedule, eat when and where the group eats, sleep when and where the group sleeps, etc. <br/>\nIf it&#39;s Tuesday this must be Belgium . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are you unschooling Europe? <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/favorite-daughter-wasnt-kidding/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/favorite-daughter-wasnt-kidding/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It&#39;s as they want it, flying solo, no family, chaperones or guides, not even a travel agent to help plan and book. Nobody told me truly individual unschooling would sometimes feel so radical. But maybe it&#39;s the parenting, period, and not any particular education method that feels like what my dad used to call the &#39;white-knuckle trip&#39; through life as a parent of intelligent life on planet earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning there was Favorite Daughter and she gave me life as a mom . . .so this is THEIR story and in truth, I guess it always been. I am more audience than author.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd at least it&#39;s illustrated. :D&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSO yes, freedom and yes, parent involvement, but our always-unschooled daughter from the very beginning has been been deeply involved in her OWN life, even when as she often does, she chooses anotherwise standrad schoolish experience. Her very-unschooled trip to Europe one July grew organically out of a tightly regimented group dance trip she was experiencing her own way for her own reasons. (She wound up in college the same different-on-the-inside way, but let&#39;s not focus on traditional schooling while deschooling is the issue. Could be confusing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Europe. This is how it started:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-europe-unschooling-culture/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-europe-unschooling-culture/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe were in a hotel room, on a trip with a larger group, thrown together as roommates by random assignment. Kiki, trying to be nice, pulled out a CD to play as we got ready to go out, and I got my first taste of Edith Piaf. Hers was a strangely enchanting music, not technically proficient or classically beautiful, but nonetheless compelling and rich.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I like this,&quot; I remember saying, &quot;What is it?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\nMy involvement looked like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/next-chapter-in-which-favorite-daughter-received-her-own-first-passport/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/next-chapter-in-which-favorite-daughter-received-her-own-first-passport/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;So she needed a passport and we had been reading about the months-long wait and all the extra wartime security checks, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight after Thanksgiving we went together to the local clerk&#39;s office, with all the stuff one needs, birth certificate and picture ID which in this case was her driver&#39;s license, etc. But then it turned out they can&#39;t take her learner&#39;s permit as a &quot;real&quot; driver&#39;s license . . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand also like this, as good for me as it was for her:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/jjs-beloved-gator-nation-makes-nyt-for-education-culture-history/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/jjs-beloved-gator-nation-makes-nyt-for-education-culture-history/</a><br/>\n&quot;We&#39;ve been reading travel pieces because Favorite Daughter is off for Europe this summer, not on a group tour and not even with the help of a travel agent. She and a friend are doing it all themselves, learning about trains and planes, pickpockets and hostels, visas and VATs, as they go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was reading this wonderful NYT piece about train travel for peaceful, non-commercial and educational green tourism  through America on Amtrak as it happens, but still it&#39;s helping us picture what riding the Eurails might be like  when I stumbled across travel power of story about my very own home town. . .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is how it looked to her through her own eyes, in her own words from her dispatches home, on some amazing Saturday afternoons one July:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/favd-and-friend-name-their-favorite-scots/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/favd-and-friend-name-their-favorite-scots/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Then we went to a diner that has Breakfast All Day, and then we checked out the National Museum of Scotland, which is a top-notch institution, and let me tell you why: There is a &quot;discovery zone&quot; for kids on the first floor, which features what appears to be THE ACTUAL TAXIDERMIED CORPSE OF DOLLY THE SHEEP, ROTATING IN A GLASS CASE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some historical things as well, but we were frankly very taken with Dolly, who is herself from just outside Edinburgh.. .&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have heard unschooling be described as &#39;Saturday afternoon in  <br/>\n&gt; July&#39;.

Clearly, there are many differing interpretations.  I have  <br/>\nread that there is nothing wrong with having all sorts of activities  <br/>\nplanned, and so I wonder, how is this different from school at home?  <br/>\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool at home is a system wherein one replicates school at home. Often there is <br/>\ndesk work or worksheets or tests and follow up work. There is a structure, a <br/>\ncurriculum, a goal that is created either by the parent or by whomever they have <br/>\npurchased the curriculum from. It is an educational system that starts with the <br/>\nbelief that there are certain pieces of knowledge that must be handed down from <br/>\nan instructor to a student for an adulthood to ever be successful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can contain bits that may look like that. Maybe some kids like to do <br/>\nworksheets or assignments. Simon used to love having me type out math problems <br/>\nfor him to do. Linnaea liked spelling tests. We&#39;ve played with worksheets in a <br/>\nsimilar way to using colouring books. But within that description are big pieces <br/>\nof difference. Linnaea asked me to ask her how to spell words. Simon asked me to <br/>\ngive him typewritten math problems. The worksheets were used as something <br/>\nmomentarily engaging. The games stopped when they stopped being fun. And other <br/>\nthings were found to engage. Whatever I may have suggested they could say no to. <br/>\nNothing was a mandatory activity. Which is a pretty major difference from my <br/>\nexperience with school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling starts far away from the first steps of school at home. It starts <br/>\nwith a trust that people learn all the time and that children operate like the <br/>\nrest of the population. They are engaged by the world around them and engage <br/>\nwith it. They learn about the things that interest them and from those things <br/>\nthey find out lots of tangential information and that cumulative process <br/>\nproduces a greater understanding of the world. I find myself doing that a lot of <br/>\nthe time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched an episode of Hercules yesterday that lead to an exploration of not <br/>\nonly who Hercules was but about Prometheus and Ioleus and Iphicles and I am now <br/>\nreading the Illustrated Bullfinch&#39;s Mythology Alex sent us a while ago (thanks <br/>\nAlex). It lead to looking at Egyptian mythology because Simon was curious as to <br/>\nwho had a larger pantheon, the Greeks or the Egyptians. It lead to discussions <br/>\nabout why the Greeks and the Romans were the more focussed on polytheistic <br/>\ntraditions among television programmes. And then it moved away from a big <br/>\ndiscussion to me still being curious and following up on my own. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon and Linnaea do a lot of that and a lot of that is moved forward by <br/>\nengagement with David or with me. Sometimes they mention something and I know <br/>\nsomething else that could add to that. Sometimes I mention something and they <br/>\nknow something else that could add to that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were littler it helped a lot to have things to do, have ideas of ways <br/>\nof moving a day into interesting and engaging things. For Simon it was a lot of <br/>\nthings like Asterix and Obelix computer games, for Linnaea it was more things <br/>\nlike playdoh or painting although both could enjoy either thing. When Simon was <br/>\n2, before Linnaea was born, I used to take big sheets and put them on the ground <br/>\nand we&#39;d finger paint with glitter and paints and glue and make a big giant mess <br/>\nand it was a moment to clean it. I wasn&#39;t teaching him how to play with glitter <br/>\nand paint and glue, I was playing with him in a way he really enjoyed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\nYou also said that some define unschooling at giving a child freedom -  <br/>\nand that this is different from the radical unschooling... Is this  <br/>\nbecause in this other definition of unschooling, the parent&#39;s comfort  <br/>\nzone is not being stretched?<br/>\n<br/>\n======================<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure I understand this. I think something may have gotten confused <br/>\nsomewhere. Unschooling is certainly about giving a child freedom to explore. <br/>\nTraditionally unschooling covers things like reading and math and history and <br/>\nwriting. Radical unschooling is about extending the freedom from those things <br/>\nthey see as educational to things like food or television or staying up late at <br/>\nnight. It is about trusting that learning happens not just in reading but also <br/>\nin diet, for example. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce mentioned that  &quot;Pat Farenga&#39;s definition of unschooling is giving kids as <br/>\nmuch freedom as a parent can comfortably bear.&quot; Is that where the confusion <br/>\nlies? If unschooling is giving a child only as much freedom as a parent can bear <br/>\nand a parent cannot bear their child not to marry the husband who they were <br/>\nbetrothed to at birth is that still an unschooling approach to parenting? If an <br/>\nhonour killing of a child is the comfort level of the parent does that make it <br/>\nunschooling? or is Pat Farenga wrong? I would argue that Pat Farenga is wrong in <br/>\npart because he isn&#39;t thinking about what he&#39;s saying, at least not really. He <br/>\nis reassuring those parents that he sees are doing the best they can with what <br/>\nthey have to be good unschooling parents. But his phrasing makes any parenting <br/>\napproach unschooling. Presumably all parents are giving their kids as much <br/>\nfreedom as they can comfortably bear. But that doesn&#39;t make what they are doing <br/>\nunschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling may not have an easy description, but there are certainly conditions <br/>\nin which it isn&#39;t happening. It isn&#39;t unschooling when your child is at school. <br/>\nEven if you are doing all that you can to make their school experience their own <br/>\nand not letting the dictates of the school be all that defines it. Sandra has a <br/>\nnice piece on public school on your own terms: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice.\">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice.</a> But even that isn&#39;t unschooling. Unschooling <br/>\nisn&#39;t pick and choose subjects, like &quot;we are unschooling everything but reading, <br/>\nshe does reading assignments for an hour a day, but I trust her to get maths on <br/>\nher own.&quot; Or &quot; we are unschooling, I let them choose to stay on a subject for as <br/>\nlong as they want, once they&#39;ve done their minimum work.&quot; That&#39;s possibly <br/>\neclectic homeschooling, some pasting of different approaches in the fear and the <br/>\nhope that it will achieve a balanced and well educated adult who will achieve at <br/>\nwhatever levels in whatever fields they want. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a kind of game of trust. You keep closing your eyes and falling <br/>\nback and hoping that the unschooling won&#39;t let you hit the floor. You keep <br/>\njumping off the ledge and hoping that the huge long fall that you see before you <br/>\nis either an illusion or has a lovely warm and powerful updraft that will allow <br/>\nyou to drift gently to the earth. Lots of people come to the edge and try and <br/>\nrepel down, they hope that if they tie themselves on to the old system, the <br/>\nseemingly tried and true system of schooled education, they can make the descent <br/>\na safer one. Unfortunately they are just handicapping themselves and they may <br/>\nnever make it anywhere except to the next ledge. The next ledge may be better <br/>\nthan at the upper edge, but it isn&#39;t as fabulous as all the way down here. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Question about deschooling myself","postDate":"1296659154","msgId":46045,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM0RDQzMTQ2LUQ5QjgtNEVFQi05MzhCLTc2MDlFM0E0RkQyNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwMDQ3RDc2LTRBQzMtNEZEMy1CMjRELURGQTM2N0NBRUQ4MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PEYwMDQ3RDc2LTRBQzMtNEZEMy1CMjRELURGQTM2N0NBRUQ4MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":46043,"nextInTopic":46046,"prevInTime":46044,"nextInTime":46046,"topicId":46035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s some follow up questions from the person who prefers to be anonymous -- Joyce ...

Feels scary!<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\nWhy wouldn&#39;t you have activities planned or brilliant suggestions for things to <br/>\ndo? Those things are totally a part of an unschooling life. Experiments, <br/>\nengagements, cool explorations, all of that. The difference is that your kids <br/>\nget to say no to the stuff they don&#39;t want to do. <br/>\n*****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if this is what the original poster meant but I am going to share some of my frustrations that are in a similar vein because it may be closely related. One of the things that I keep running into is the fact that my kids get to do cool arts and crafts all the time. We don&#39;t have activities planned per se but we do lots of fun stuff. It&#39;s hard because my girls want to get together with people and just hang out. They don&#39;t like the idea that play time with a friend has to be structured. My 6 year old met a friend that she really likes. My family met her friend&#39;s family at the park and they played for several hours. There were a few road bumps but it wasn&#39;t anything bad. After that day, I never heard from the mom again. When we parted ways, the mom said she would call and we would do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband continued to take my 6 year old to the place where she met her friend but after a while, her friend stopped going. I got an e-mail out of the blue inviting us to a Valentine&#39;s Card making get together. Making cards isn&#39;t a big deal to my daughter. She would rather just play. Making cool stuff is common place to my kids. Having other parents plan and schedule every little thing is not common place in our house so it can sometimes be difficult. It sometimes feels like you have to be able to organize a structured activity in order for your kids to have playmates. Where I live, it seems like the free play at play groups and park days have become opportunities for other moms to find a way to structure things. It seems like a competition as to who can organize the coolest activity/experiment/whatever. It is just another venue for moms to compete to be the &quot;best&quot; mom. The play group that we used to go to has been putting out messages about attendance requirements and more and more of the play groups are at museums and zoos or are being planned around a specific activity. More and more of the messages are about how you need to control what your children are doing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI dropped out of a group that hosted park days because it seemed like it went from being a place where homeschooler/unschoolers met up to play to a place where moms got together to talk about all of the activities and curricula that they were cramming into the lives of their children. It was a good resource when I thought my girls wanted a bunch of structured activities but when I realized that my girls really want to hang out and have fun without other people telling them how to do it, I backed off the organized activities. Now, we do lots of fun stuff at home and as a family. We are doing all kinds of experiments and crafts, we are just doing them at home or on our terms. It is hard at times because it can sometimes feel like you aren&#39;t doing anything because you don&#39;t have a wall calendar with every day filled up with activities. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn activity does not have to be formally scheduled and planned in order to be counted as an activity. An experiment or a craft does not have to come out of a book. It doesn&#39;t have to be fancy or elaborate either. It doesn&#39;t have to be formal or structured. Experiments and crafts cover so much more than what most people think of when they think of an experiment or a craft. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":209361242,"authorName":"JJ","from":"&quot;JJ&quot; &lt;jrossedd@...&gt;","profile":"jrossedd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Question about deschooling myself","postDate":"1296500891","msgId":46038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpNzFhcitzZzE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwMDQ3RDc2LTRBQzMtNEZEMy1CMjRELURGQTM2N0NBRUQ4MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":46037,"nextInTopic":46039,"prevInTime":46037,"nextInTime":46039,"topicId":46035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The easy answer is: what an amazing unschool writer your friend might become one day! Reminds me of that old Haley Mills movie, the Trouble With Angels, do you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1646269233\">The easy answer is: what an amazing unschool writer your friend might become one day! Reminds me of that old Haley Mills movie, the Trouble With Angels, do you remember? She was the Catholic school student who didn&#39;t need anybody or anything, had to do it her own way, didn&#39;t want any part of the school or church, a rebel getting others ito trouble and resisting the deeper meanings all around her, right up until graduation -- when she shocked her classmates and most of the nuns by staying to take vows and be a nun. She had learned more than anyone else through challenging it all so hard, engaging the ideas to fight against them and in the end not being able to deny its power. So she surrendered to it and simultaneously became more powerful than she could possibly imagine (no wait, that&#39;s Star Wars, hmmm . . .)<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like that anyway. ;-)<br/>\nThe point I saw in it, was that it can be the person who struggles hardest that learns the most. It is one good way if not the only way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe longer answer is that I was like that, too, in some sense. A doctorate in public schooling and all my friends/family with advanced degrees and sharing a reverence for education and public service. Also I was making much more money in a high state-level position than my partner was as a newspaper reporter, when I came home with our first. For years I made homeschoolers and then unschoolers really annoyed by trying to talk to them about &quot;school&quot; stuff. I&#39;ll think back and try to pull out some specifics that speak to these questions but in the meantime I&#39;ve thought and written a lot about it less specifically, in ways that might get your friend&#39;s own thoughts unstuck and flowing again. The first thing that came to mind was this, three years ago when a group of us decided to imagine what our lives would be like if we hadn&#39;t had children at all:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/05/31/without-kids-what-would-i-know-worth-knowing/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/2008/05/31/without-kids-what-would-i-know-worth-knowing/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWithout Kids, What Would I Know Worth Knowing?<br/>\n31 05 2008<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would I be doing now without kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my life parenting has been a real education. So I guess without kids, I&#39;d just be uneducated!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is funny to me now, in light of all the formal schooling I had under my belt before I had kids. By 30 I had earned my doctorate and some worldly responsibility for other people&#39;s children, for the structure and process of THEIR educations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I didn&#39;t have children of my own to think about, I&#39;d still be thinking about kids and education and getting paid for it, but my own education would have a big black light-sucking hole in it and I&#39;d probably never even know it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd without having kids who changed my life, would I be a systems thinker? What I&#39;ve learned by living this life as mom to these children, is that moms don&#39;t only give life to their kids. We give life to ourselves in the process. Family life IS life itself, not a separate unit or system apart from the real world, not a straight line with ancestors and descendants going up and down in a family &quot;tree.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily is organic process, not inert structure. Ever see the movie &quot;Mindwalk&quot; with Sam Waterston, John Heard and Liv Ullmann?<br/>\n<br/>\n    A Cartesian would conceptually take the tree to pieces but a systems thinker would see the seasonal exchange between tree and earth, earth and sky, the breadth of life, the life of the tree in relation to the life of the forest, and as a home for insects and the fruits it produces  not as something separate, but a member of a larger living system.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Interdependence.<br/>\n    Web of relationships is the essence of all living things.<br/>\n<br/>\n    This is a scientific fact. The theory of living systems is an outline of an answer to &quot;what is life?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t know without actually having them but I&#39;ve learned well by now, that being a mom to these kids is the essence of my life, the central hub for my web of relationships. I can&#39;t take it to pieces to see how it works, or swap the parts around, put it back together again in alternate form to see what might have been.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in the process of learning so much from having these kids, I&#39;ve learned to respect the unknowable, to be humble before its power. That isn&#39;t a religious statement to me. It&#39;s just life as I know it. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m posting this for someone else who is reading on the list and would  <br/>\n&gt; like your input. :-) -- Joyce<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; =================<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hi<br/>\n&gt; I would like to hear about people&#39;s experiences with unschooling and  <br/>\n&gt; deschooling themselves.

Those things are totally a part of an unschooling life. Experiments, <br/>\nengagements, cool explorations, all of that. The difference is that your kids <br/>\nget to say no to the stuff they don&#39;t want to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Question about deschooling myself","postDate":"1296498808","msgId":46035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYwMDQ3RDc2LTRBQzMtNEZEMy1CMjRELURGQTM2N0NBRUQ4MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46036,"prevInTime":46034,"nextInTime":46036,"topicId":46035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m posting this for someone else who is reading on the list and would like your input. :-) -- Joyce ================= Hi I would like to hear about people s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1671327576\">I&#39;m posting this for someone else who is reading on the list and would  <br/>\nlike your input. :-) -- Joyce<br/>\n<br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\nHi<br/>\nI would like to hear about people&#39;s experiences with unschooling and  <br/>\ndeschooling themselves.  I think that is behind my feeling conflicted  <br/>\nand wanting to have intellectual stimulation.  I feel that I am not  <br/>\nproductive, etc., feel a lot of pressure to be doing me, pressure even  <br/>\nthat I&#39;m wasting my life and brains by homeschooling here in Canada.   <br/>\nAnd I am not very self-assured that the folks saying this aren&#39;t  <br/>\nright... I mean, I do know the value of unschooling and feel strongly  <br/>\nabout it, and still I get swamped with doubts in this bigger context  <br/>\nof worrying about not being productive - I was raised by very  <br/>\nhardworking immigtant parents who think I&#39;m wasting my education and  <br/>\nchance at greater material success...
