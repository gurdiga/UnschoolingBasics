The trust that you have to have that your child will be OK if you don&#39;t control them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs your children&#39;s happiness one of the most important things to you?    Is their joy in life the goal in your parenting?  For me, joy and happiness is more important than what they end up being when they grow up, or if they are learning enough or reading at the right age.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did limit TV years ago.  My oldest 2 kids may have watched TV more after I decided that we didn&#39;t want to do limits anymore.  And there still may be days that my youngest, who has never been limited, will watch a few hours of TV.  But there will also be days that the TV doesn&#39;t get turned on at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we moved to a new town,  I think all of them watched more.  There wasn&#39;t as much in our lives at that time and maybe they needed that safe thing, as far as it wasn&#39;t changing like their home or town.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, TV is just another resource in our life.  It&#39;s just like a book or a computer or a sewing machine.  If there&#39;s something on that they want to watch they&#39;ll watch it.  If they feel like laying around a bit,  they might watch it or they might not.  We do other things too so they will often choose to do something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet go of time limits and what is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;.  Some days Kyra (dd10) will play (talk, write, watch music/videos) on the computer for a few hours, some days she won&#39;t be on it at all.  When we first got our sewing machine she&#39;d get up and sew and sew.  But now she hasn&#39;t been on the sewing machine that much.  My son (14) will hardly ever turn on the TV.  But he will play World of Warcraft right now for hours.  He has some goals that he wants to attain in that game right now and it&#39;s important to him.  So that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.  He will come up and go with us to walk the dog, he will watch a video or 2 with his sister also,  but he will spend hours playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look at his gaming right now as his &quot;specialty&quot;. ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it will take some time to see all they are learning, with and without TV.  Maybe it will take some time to see that TV isn&#39;t bad, look at the happiness and joy that&#39;s in their faces.  For me,  the joy and happiness transcended the worry.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\nKelli~   mom to Alec 14, Abbi 12 and Kyra 10<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can read about us at:  ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better Heartthrob.

I can see <br/>\nespecially in the last few days with my struggles with it that I have <br/>\nnot totally flipped my internal paradigm with it even though I <br/>\nthought <br/>\nI had....I still have the same fears come up.  I go back to various <br/>\nposts about TV I have bookmarked like off Sandra&#39;s website, and read <br/>\nthem and it sinks in for awhile, but I really see areas my thoughts <br/>\nhave not changed.  I have a 7 yr old dd who has always watched shows <br/>\n*I* deem acceptable (I am ashamed to even say this on an unschooling <br/>\nlist...but I have realized I have been thinking this way deep <br/>\ndown...leave it to my kids to point out things like that) like <br/>\nTreehouse TV, Discovery Kids, etc but lately has discovered channels <br/>\nlike YTv and &quot;older&quot; kids shows, ones that show characters with <br/>\nflippant attitudes, older themes, etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wandering into territory with this that is making me <br/>\nuncomfortable, and really making me realize I need to put my money <br/>\nwhere my mouth is, do I really trust my kids and trust natural <br/>\nlearning?<br/>\nI find myself cringing when I keep thinking she needs &quot;something <br/>\nbetter <br/>\nto do&quot; (who am I to judge that?) or feeling like the whole day has <br/>\ngone <br/>\nby with her &quot;just watching TV.&quot;  She makes many plans and asks about <br/>\nthings she wants to do with me, such as puzzles, baking cookies, etc <br/>\nbut it seems to go by the wayside and the tv is on all day and she <br/>\nhas <br/>\nwatched like literally 7-8 shows in a row., then she complains we <br/>\nnever <br/>\ndo anything together..  I find myself swinging widely on <br/>\nthis...there&#39;s <br/>\ndays I feel angry at myself because I have not been more proactive in <br/>\noffering other options and she is watching TV and I am off doing my <br/>\nown <br/>\nthing and not watching with her(this is painful for me to admit), <br/>\ndays I want to throw out the <br/>\ntv completely, etc  We have brainstormed possibly getting an on-paper <br/>\ntv guide and picking out what she wants to watch each day, and making <br/>\na <br/>\nlist of things we want to do together (me stopping what I am doing <br/>\nand <br/>\nher turning it off), etc but so far that has not materialized. I also <br/>\nfeel she may do this just to &quot;please&quot; me if that makes sense. It&#39;s <br/>\nlike <br/>\nI am quiet about it, and then end up nagging when I try to express my <br/>\nthought to her about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am more relaxed than I used to be, as I described above I have <br/>\ntimes <br/>\nI generally feel fine with the tv but then days I feel like this.  <br/>\nThe <br/>\nwhole &quot;doing nothing but watching TV&quot; feeling ties into an <br/>\nundercurrent <br/>\nof doubt I am feeling at present about unschooling.  When I have a dd <br/>\nwho struggles with reading for example and shows very little interest <br/>\nin writing (although when I compare her with &quot;her&quot; and not others she <br/>\nis growing by leaps and bounds) and a 4 yr old ds who is awaiting <br/>\ngenetic testing and has been diagnosed with developmental delay  with <br/>\nbeing in size/gross motor skills/speech like an 18 mo-2 yr old, (and <br/>\nwith the OT freaking out for example that he is not doing more <br/>\ncoloring <br/>\nor playdough or whatever...why I got him a diagnosis is a whole other <br/>\npost that I will put up someday but basically his physical challenges <br/>\nwere causing him alot of difficulty in his life) it is hard to <br/>\nsilence <br/>\nthose schooly voices in my head that they are watching it &quot;too much&quot; <br/>\nand that &quot;all those studies&quot; are right or that maybe she would be <br/>\nreading better if she didn&#39;t watch so much, etc.  I am just trying to <br/>\nreconcile that voice with the realization that if I TRULY believe <br/>\nthat <br/>\neverything in my children&#39;s lives is valuable and they can learn from <br/>\nit, that I would not limit TV now would I?<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I need serious help here!
