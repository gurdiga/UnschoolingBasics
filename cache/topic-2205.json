The worst part is that <br/>\nI don&#39;t even think she read it  :-( <br/>\n <br/>\nAgnes Lestico wrote I Learn Better By Teaching Myself  and  Still Teaching <br/>\nOurselves.  I got both books in one volume from FUN  Books at a discount.  She <br/>\ntalks about following a childs  interests in learning.  Maybe not strictly <br/>\nUNschooling to some on the list  here, the children used some textbooks, but only <br/>\nif they wanted to.  Still  an interesting read. Published by Holt GWS.<br/>\n <br/>\nIn Their Own Way by Thomas Armstrong is also not an unschooling  book.  He <br/>\ndiscusses Gardners theory of multiple intelligences and how  families and <br/>\nteachers can use the theory to help kids learn.  He advocates  following a childs <br/>\nlead and keeping the stress level low in learning  situations.  Which in turn <br/>\nlead me to think that the best way to do this  would be ......UNSCHOOLING!<br/>\n <br/>\nGeorge Dennison wrote The Lives of Children describing the First  Street <br/>\nSchool.  The students were a group of challenging poor city kids,  sort of an <br/>\nunschooling day school if such a thing is possible.  John Holt  taked about it in <br/>\nat least one of his books but I can&#39;t recall which one right  now.  But I <br/>\nthought it was really interesting how they let these kids from  different minority <br/>\ngroups work out their agressions and come to terms with each  other without <br/>\nalot of interference.  I have to admit that these kids would  have frightened <br/>\nme.  But it helped me to let go of some of the little daily  conflicts that my <br/>\nkids get involved in and see that the best was to help kids  resolve their <br/>\ncomflicts is to let them work through them on their own.   Trust kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for the recommendations.  I&#39;m adding them to my list.  I  try to get <br/>\nas many books as I can from used book stores, yard sales, ebay.   But I do <br/>\norder a couple a month from my local book store.  I use the  library too, but <br/>\nsometimes my reading habits don&#39;t always meld with library due  dates.  I&#39;ve been <br/>\nreading Magical Child for TEN YEARS now ;-)  <br/>\n <br/>\nCheryl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170364620,"authorName":"we3deeves@aol.com","from":"we3deeves@...","profile":"emmasmama99","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Reading List","postDate":"1090162269","msgId":2205,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFkNi4yNjY3YmM5OC4yZTJiZTg1ZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2223,"prevInTime":2204,"nextInTime":2206,"topicId":2205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 7/18/2004 4:33:16 AM Central Standard Time, ...
