She is too big for an umbrella stroller (they only go to 35lbs, and she is nearly 50lbs) and they don&#39;t function well in many of the places we go to. A stroller is also very restrictive for her, when she is used to being free within our home and in other places like the playground. I try to not use it very often, but sometimes it&#39;s necessary.
