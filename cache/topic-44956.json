Some are healed through and<br/>\nothers still hold jewelry. I have never had an issue with any piercing<br/>\nwhether I did it myself or with a professional (many of my friends are pro<br/>\npiercers/tattooists).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also many kits available online that have videos and the piercing<br/>\nequipment if someone should really want to do it themselves.

And it isn&#39;t a new thing, people<br/>\nhave been doing it for thousands of year. I think it would be respectful to<br/>\ndiscuss it with him and listen to his concerns. Hear what they really are.<br/>\nBecause it is unlikely that he just doesn&#39;t agree with non-ear piercings. Is<br/>\nhe concerned with the healing/care/infections? or does he find that &quot;ugly&quot;,<br/>\nunappealing, etc? Is he worried of what others might think? Does he<br/>\nassociate other piercings with a certain kind of person he finds<br/>\ndistasteful? These and other issues can be worked through. It seems<br/>\ndishonest to hid it from a family member.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Oct 14, 2010 at 4:50 PM, Marla &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:marla@...\">marla@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t mind her getting her bellybutton pierced (o.k.
