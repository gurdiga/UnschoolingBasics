We spent a miserable evening at a famiy&#39;s house last <br/>\nnight. We knew it was going to be miserable, but felt compelled to <br/>\ngo because it was a birthday celebration for a friend of Laurie&#39;s <br/>\n(he lives with us) at his parents home. His mother and sil yelled at <br/>\nthe two boys the entire evening. Every move they made was criticized.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne grandson is 9 and hearing and sight impaired and a few other <br/>\nproblems. He walked into a solid glass storm door and the <br/>\ngrandmother yelled, &quot;You idiot! How many times are you going to do <br/>\nthat?&quot; My bf said, &quot;Maybe putting some kind of sticker on the door <br/>\nat eye level would help him see it.&quot; (we were ready to tackle this <br/>\nwoman and put duct tape on her mouth) She said, &quot;He&#39;s done it 1000 <br/>\ntimes. I&#39;m not messing up my door with a sticker just because he&#39;s <br/>\nstupid.&quot; Our mouths dropped open and I said, &quot;Why are you all so <br/>\nmean to the children?&quot;  She replied, &quot;Because they&#39;re hell spawn.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe two boys were so sweet - not even rambunctious in the least. My <br/>\nheart was breaking. I agree with Deb. No one would have remained <br/>\nsilent if that witch was talking to an adult like that. Why should <br/>\nwe remain silent when it&#39;s a child being abused? The kids need us to <br/>\nspeak out for them. They have NO power in their own homes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve said it before after visiting them (twice in seven years) that <br/>\nI will NEVER go there again, but last night was the clincher. I will <br/>\nNEVER go there again. <br/>\n***Okay, I&#39;m going out on a limb here, but I have to believe if we REALLY <br/>\nwant to do something that is going to help the child/change the parents, you have <br/>\nto come across to the parent in a gentler/nonjudgmental way.  YES, we are <br/>\nhorrified, but if we react to their parenting style by telling them indignantly, <br/>\nin essense what bad parents they are, then all they will feel is hostile and <br/>\nthey will only be able to focus on the attack of their parenting, not on how <br/>\nthey could parent differently.  I think rather than that we need to try to find <br/>\na way to open the door for change....not have it slammed in your face (which <br/>\nonly leaves the child behind in the same situation).  Being indignant would <br/>\nonly be sort of a way to make yourself feel like you&#39;d reacted...but it wouldn&#39;t <br/>\ngo far in creating a change in the child&#39;s life, YKWIM?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1596,"nextTopicId":1659}}
