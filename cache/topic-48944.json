I say, if you feel like you would be happier<br/>\ndoing something *more* or *different*, then do it!  You&#39;re not working to<br/>\nfulfill anyone&#39;s expectations but your own :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time where I thought TV rots brains (I am totally exaggerating)<br/>\nand filled my kids&#39; days with as much fun activities as distractions to<br/>\nthem needing tv as possible.  That was fine then, it worked for us and made<br/>\nus happy, but this changed and that&#39;s ok too.  It is ok to change your mind<br/>\nabout what&#39;s good for parenting.  Over a year ago I began to see the merits<br/>\nof them enjoying tv and *Chose* to change the way I look and feel about<br/>\nit.  We picked two programs from netflix - The Last Airbender and Phineas &<br/>\nFerb - and TOGETHER we watched every single episode.  These shows are so<br/>\nfull of intelligent and enjoyable content.  The quality time we spent<br/>\nwatching them was priceless and amazing.  We&#39;ve since moved on to the<br/>\nentire family LOVING a video game - Little Big Planet - together.  We all<br/>\nplay and laugh and have a great time.   A year prior I would have scoffed<br/>\nat encouraging so much screen time.  But I chose to see it differently and<br/>\nnow I feel peace about meeting their needs differently than I would have<br/>\nthought appropriate before.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the point of the anecdote is that as much as I understood that thinking<br/>\noutside the box was important to unschooling before, I was still stuck in<br/>\nthe thought that all moms had similar responsibilities - wake early,<br/>\nencourage schedules and consistency, manage things that children can&#39;t be<br/>\ngiven full trust over (sleep habits, eating, media).  I had to make a<br/>\nchoice to get unstuck, and had to ask myself for a while if I really<br/>\nbelieved it was the right way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a nutshell, you&#39;re probably still needing to deschool yourself from the<br/>\nideas of what you &quot;should&quot; or &quot;should not&quot; be doing as a mom.  To find out<br/>\nthe mom you want to be and your kids truly need and to know that it changes<br/>\nand its ok to change with it :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 21, 2012 10:56 AM, &quot;messy_boys&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:messy_boys@...\">messy_boys@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Are there certain things that I, as the unschooling mom, need to be doing?<br/>\n&gt; For example, do I need to have more structure and order for myself in order<br/>\n&gt; to meet the needs of my kids?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now, I do not have any set schedule for myself.
