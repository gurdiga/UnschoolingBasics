I was a<br/>\nlittle heart broken, because we had such a great nursing relationship, and<br/>\nit was something we both really enjoyed. Lila is someone who is extremely<br/>\nengaged by the world around her, and in non-stop motion from the time she<br/>\nwakes up to the time she goes to sleep. I honestly think she just ran out of<br/>\ntime during her very busy days to remember to nurse LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe had our 2nd child 2 wks before Lila&#39;s 3rd birthday. When she saw Pippa<br/>\nnursing, she became very interested in being a part of this experience. She<br/>\nwould talk about what she remembered about nursing (a truly surprising<br/>\namount, IMO!), and how much she enjoyed nursing, and that she missed it. I<br/>\nlet her know, every time she mentioned missing her &quot;nummies&quot; that she was<br/>\nwelcome to nurse again. She was really funny about it. At first she was like<br/>\n&quot;Nooooooooo!!!!! You&#39;re silly!&quot; Then, little by little, she started playing<br/>\nat nursing again. After about 3 weeks of this little &quot;courtship with the<br/>\nboob,&quot; she latched on again, a little awkwardly at first, but now, several<br/>\ntimes a week, she latches like the pro she&#39;s always been. Up until about a<br/>\nweek ago, she always wanted to nurse when Pippa was nursing, and she had to<br/>\ndecide who got which side (Lila always wanted the fuller one, of course<br/>\n:-)). Fortunately, Pippa, who is 10 months now, LOVES when Lila nurses at<br/>\nthe same time as her. This week, Lila also wanted to nurse on her own a few<br/>\ntimes. So I think at first, Lila, in one sense, wanted what Pippa was<br/>\ngetting (I know there is more to it than that, but I&#39;m exhausted, so that&#39;s<br/>\nall I&#39;ve got to offer right now LOL!), and now, I feel she has just really<br/>\nre-connected in her own right. I couldn&#39;t be happier. Lila was really<br/>\ninterested in &quot;people&quot; food by the age of 6 months, demanding it, really.<br/>\nPippa, on the other hand, at 10 months has NO interest whatsoever. I laugh<br/>\nto myself when I hear people saying, in response to someone else&#39;s concerns<br/>\nabout when to wean that &quot;don&#39;t worry about it .they won&#39;t be nursing when<br/>\nthey go off to college/get their driver&#39;s license/reach puberty/etc,&quot;<br/>\nbecause sometimes I think Pippa will, she loves it so much LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a very dear friend (a fellow unschooler) who still nurses her 5<br/>\nand 7 year old, only a few times a week, but that bond is still there. The 7<br/>\nyr old seems about ready to stop (and may have, by now) but the 5 yr old<br/>\nstill wants that &quot;once-a-day to unwind&quot; nursing session. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nurse on, I say. The benefits are immeasurable.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"WAS: Re: McD&#39;s NOW: Bfeeding, lol!","postDate":"1183081592","msgId":24764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY2MW85bytqazU5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ3Y2Q5MGUyMDcwNjI4MTgyNHEzN2E4ZDlkOHgzNGY3N2NkMDUzM2VmNzcxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":24762,"nextInTopic":24766,"prevInTime":24763,"nextInTime":24765,"topicId":24662,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~I can t picture nursing my 5 year old at the moment but that s mainly because we haven t had a breastfeeding relationship for many years, but if he d been","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1578279708\">~~I can&#39;t picture nursing my 5 year old at the moment but that&#39;s mainly<br/>\nbecause we haven&#39;t had a breastfeeding relationship for many years,<br/>\nbut if he&#39;d been nursing the whole time it would feel natural. ~~<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it does.

My youngest son just weaned a few weeks ago and he was 5 in april. For him it had nothing to do with nourishment the past few years and was all about comfort and bonding. I never thought I would nurse this long, my other 3 kids weaned much earlier, but as the time went by it just continued to feel natural. As he got older he was only allowed to nurse one time a day and his favorite time was nap time. <br/>\nHe has asthma and I totally believe breastfeeding has kept him from having worse issues with it. Now that he has been weaned for a few weeks he has had one asthma attack on top of the other but when he was nursing he very rarely had any problems.<br/>\nHe totally weaned by himself. One day he said he was done and he never asked for it again. I am glad he is done in a way but am a bit sad that that part of my life is done with. I will not be having any more babies and will never nurse another baby...<br/>\nI really think that it just depends on what you are comfortable with. Our dr always told us to breastfeed as long as it was mutually agreed upon...so not me forcing him to and not him making me continue past what I felt comfortable with. I was always certain though that he would reach a point that he decided he no longer wanted to nurse...<br/>\nAs far as hurting, it very rarely hurt, once in awhile if he had a cold he would latch a bit odd and I would tell him it was hurting and he would relatch,<br/>\nI think it was a total comfort to him and to me was something special that only I could give him. It was a nursng relationship between the 2 of us. My body responded to him by producing the amount of milk he needed. It is quite amazing when you think of how the body works to produce milk for a baby.<br/>\nIf it would be uncomfortable to nurse an older child then it would not be the right thing for you to do, but for some people it is just a natural part of life and is not looked upon any differently then other stages of life.<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I&#39;m &quot;new&quot; to this but I have a 6 year old daughter and the thought <br/>\n  of her breastfeeding from me blows me away.

Although he doesn&#39;t nurse everyday anymore. But he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;probably asks everyday. I do try to distract him since honestly I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sometimes not comfortable with it anymore. It comes and goes. The<br/>\n&gt; &gt;most difficult time for me (and him) is first thing in the morning.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;He&#39;s one of those kids who has pretty well always woken up crying or<br/>\n&gt; &gt;moaning. When he was a baby, it usually didn&#39;t get that far since<br/>\n&gt; &gt;he&#39;d nurse right away. But then his brother was born...and usually my<br/>\n&gt; &gt;little one would be nursing when my older boy woke up crying for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;milk. All four of us are in the bed together so I would be right next<br/>\n&gt; &gt;to him. I know many moms tandem nurse in really bizarre positions but<br/>\n&gt; &gt;that was not what Sam wanted, he wanted me all to himself. Nothing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;but solo-me-facing-him nursing would do. The mornings became<br/>\n&gt; &gt;unbearable since all the crying would wake up Quinn who would have<br/>\n&gt; &gt;slept for a couple more hours otherwise. Eventually, I started<br/>\n&gt; &gt;replying Sam could nurse after he had breakfast and dh would get up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;with him. As soon as Sam was up and on the couch reading with dh, he<br/>\n&gt; &gt;was as happy as could be. And he usually wouldn&#39;t ask for milk for<br/>\n&gt; &gt;several hours afterwards.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;But this was all heart-wrenching for me. It was clearly a need on<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Sam&#39;s part but I couldn&#39;t meet it in the way he needed or wanted it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;Within days of making the rule &quot;after breakfast&quot; he started waking up<br/>\n&gt; &gt;less unhappily. I don&#39;t necessarily think this is a good thing,<br/>\n&gt; &gt;possibly just a sign that he interpreted it as, &quot;don&#39;t tell us about<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it&quot;.

It&#39;s just who he is, and I&#39;m doing all I can to help him be his  <br/>\ntruest self. For us, that means nursing until he is done. Not so much with the <br/>\n DH, who is still uncomfy with children who are able to ask, lol, but I&#39;m <br/>\nworking  n a slow training of that handsome and wonderful man ;) I am also <br/>\nnursing my  baby that will be 2 in late July. I also nursed my other 3 from my first <br/>\n marriage - my oldest until 3.5 (I asked her to stop and she did) and the <br/>\nother  two were nearly 3 when they quit themselves. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s definitely not a snack or a food issue, though it was when they both  <br/>\nhad the rotovirus and couldn&#39;t keep anything but my milk down. I do believe it  <br/>\nsaved us from hospitalization. It&#39;s a time for Julian to feel calm, to feel  <br/>\nconnected to me, to feel special in this wild house of 5 kids and to help him  <br/>\nfall asleep. When his feelings are hurt, or his body is hurt, it&#39;s quick, easy <br/>\n and loving comfort. It&#39;s just an extension of our relationship, and it has <br/>\ngrown  with us - changed as time has passed. The positioning, the reasoning, <br/>\nthe style,  then whens and wheres...At times, it DOES hurt. But I ask him to <br/>\nrelatch and  usually it&#39;s ok. Recently, the sensation hasn&#39;t been psychologically <br/>\ncomfortable  for me, and so we are talking more about weaning and what types <br/>\nof differences  there will be as that happens. I always assure him that his <br/>\nfavorite time to  nurse will remain as long as he needs it, but the early <br/>\nmorning and occasional  times in the night need to be gone. We have a &quot;rule&quot; (don&#39;t <br/>\nlaugh, all you RUs,  lol! ;) ) that we nurse one time in the day, and often he <br/>\nforgets about it, or  is too busy to do so - and that&#39;s fine with me! I&#39;m not <br/>\ntoo ridged with it  however, but it&#39;s rarely asked for more than one time a <br/>\nday. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf you are interested in why and how of nursing preschool age children  (ack! <br/>\nI just caught myself!), of nursing the very young child ;) , there are a  few <br/>\ngreat things out there. Kellymom.com has some, lalecheleague.org does too,  <br/>\nand the book, &quot;Mothering Your Nursing Toddler by Norma Bumgarner has some more  <br/>\ninvolved info on it. But I admit - this group and my in-person homeschooling  <br/>\ngroup I belong to, has been the MOST informative and helpful in my &quot;dark <br/>\nhours&quot;  of wanting to rip them off and chuck &#39;em out the window! ;)<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m glad you asked, Jen, because 1) I like talking about it, as I consider  <br/>\nmyself a lactavist and an LC with no letters behind her name (I am self  <br/>\neducated, lol!

When the <br/>\nthird baby was born I ended up with too much bleeding and had to stay <br/>\nin hospital for four days. New baby had jaundice and needed as much <br/>\nmilk as possible. It was really terrible as they had never really <br/>\nbeen away from me. This ended up being an adult led almost weaning <br/>\nfor my almost five year old. I still feel very sad about it. She was <br/>\nstill allowed to occasionally nurse, but the first month I had to <br/>\ntell her no so many times. After that it was an only occasional <br/>\nthing. This wasn&#39;t the child led weaning that I had wanted for her. <br/>\nMaybe it was good for her to know that the baby and the toddler <br/>\nneeded it more. Maybe it has made her feel a little displaced. I go <br/>\nback and forth with my thinking about it. With three under five maybe <br/>\nthere is no perfect solution. Nursing was such a happy time for her. <br/>\nI wish it hadn&#39;t ended in a sad way.
