I have 4 children ans have been homeschooling for nine years.  I have never consciously chosen to unschooling before but did fall into with the birth of my babies, illnesses, etc.  We ha e sort of been unschooling for six months this time since my baby was born.  I have only recently considered unschooling as a full-time way of schooling my children.  I was wondering if anyone could give me ideas or suggestions for beginning a full-time unschooling lifestyle?
