Just &quot;google&quot; Girl Scouts in <br/>\nXXXX County (whatever county you are in).  We went through a couple <br/>\nof troops before my older daughter found one she was comfortable <br/>\nwith.  You would have thought she would have wanted to be with <br/>\nother &quot;homeschoolers&quot;, but her current troop actually has some girls <br/>\nwho &quot;swim&quot; like she does... on competitive swim teams.  So I would <br/>\nsay if you visit some local troops, maybe your daughter will find a <br/>\ntroop with some girls who share some of her passions.  I don&#39;t know <br/>\nthat the &quot;unschooling&quot; is that important when it comes to making <br/>\nfriends as it is to find others who enjoy the same things you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough GS troops do charge a fee (ours is $5 a month & $10 annual <br/>\nregistration), they can&#39;t force you to purchase a uniform (recommend <br/>\nbut not required).  Our service area also has &quot;loaners&quot; for those <br/>\nwho don&#39;t want or can&#39;t buy a uniform.  As I mentioned there is <br/>\nusually a troop dues amount, but if you have a financial hardship, <br/>\nthey should be able to waive this fee.  I know that we are <br/>\nencouraged to sponsor and give for this purpose; and it is nice to <br/>\nknow that there are girls out there who are using these funds that <br/>\nwould not have the chance to join otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck to you and your daughter!<br/>\n-Patty<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;thisismaggiesemailaddress&quot; <br/>\n&lt;thisismaggiesemailaddress@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hello :-)<br/>\n&gt; I was wondering if someone could give me some ideas?

Supply a few crafty items (markers, crayon, paper, <br/>\nglitter, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nDungeons and Dragons Saturdays. Find some dad who was the dungeon <br/>\nmaster in high school. &lt;bwg&gt; Again, supply refreshments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you build it, they will come.
