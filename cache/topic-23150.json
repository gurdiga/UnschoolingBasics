The trouble is deciding on how<br/>\nto homeschool.  <br/>\n <br/>\n*****  How about homeschooling with what *you* feel is good for your<br/>\nfamily?  Having a rigid box that you need to stay in will not make your<br/>\nbig family happy all the time.  Having different ressources for<br/>\ndifferent kids is what will work for you.  If your blind child wants to<br/>\nlearn specific things and he needs specific tools, why not make them/<br/>\nbuy them for him?  If your kids love to read, bring them to the library<br/>\nmore often.  I have friends who say &quot;I can&#39;t unschool since I&#39;m not<br/>\ncomfortable doing this or that&quot;, but I know, watching them, that they<br/>\nare unschoolers, but they don&#39;t listen to themselves, they listen to<br/>\nthat stiff box where you can&#39;t get out unless...  One day, they&#39;ll find<br/>\nthe crack in their box and find out the real unschooler in them :-)  <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nI might also mention that I&#39;m halfway to being crunchy and, well, I<br/>\nwant to make my decisions based one what I believe to be right, not<br/>\njust because it fits with my newly crunchy life. (Homeschooling,<br/>\ncooking from scratch, breastfeeding, cloth diapering, baby wearing,<br/>\ndelaying and very selectively vaccinating- perhaps non-vaxing,<br/>\nhomebirthing, and having a slew of kids...If only I had money I&#39;d go<br/>\norganic too.) So, I am trying to sort out what is right. Please<br/>\ndon&#39;t attack me as if I&#39;m anti unschooling. I am looking for<br/>\ninformation and trying to figure out what is right.  <br/>\n <br/>\nLive for the simple pleasures of life, and make your children live it<br/>\nwith you.  Answer their questions, initiate fun stuff.  Make a garden,<br/>\nit&#39;ll be food for the family,  a way of having children close by, and<br/>\neven find a passion for your 5 yo.  All kids love to play in a garden,<br/>\nfor some it&#39;s watering the plants, for others it&#39;s watching the carrots<br/>\ngrow, others it&#39;s picking the ripe veggies, digging and planting,<br/>\ncollecting seeds.  Different kids.  Make a smell and touch garden for<br/>\nyour blind child.   Build a tee-pee with branches found on in your yard<br/>\nor in a nearby forest.  If all the kids participate, great!  If no-one<br/>\nhelps make it but they love play in it, the goal is attained too!<br/>\nMake *your* life fun, their&#39;s will follow.  <br/>\n <br/>\nGenevieve, mom to 4 boys, <br/>\nFelix-9-, Jonathan-8-, Xavier and Robin-5-<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZS\">http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZS</a>&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171305668,"authorName":"Beth Fleming","from":"Beth Fleming &lt;momofwc@...&gt;","profile":"momofwc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Looking for success stories","postDate":"1176813195","msgId":23220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzMjkxNC45MzI2My5xbUB3ZWIzMDAxNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGV2dW9vbys4cmdmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23211,"nextInTopic":23345,"prevInTime":23219,"nextInTime":23221,"topicId":23150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Thanks, Melissa, for posting this blog!

When I ask for ideas on how to teach something or<br/>\nother people tend to give me some curriculum I ought to use to teach<br/>\nmy childrem.  One lady is very much against teaching math without a<br/>\ncurriculum because apparently you have to teach it in a certain order<br/>\nso that the child won&#39;t become confused later on.  Many ladies<br/>\nrecommend looking at the worldbook website to determine what the<br/>\nchildren should be learning in each grade.  One lady is against<br/>\nchildren reading young because it will mess up their eyes.  (I&#39;d hate<br/>\nto keep my children from reading when it is something they want,<br/>\nthough.)  I&#39;m just bombarded with curriculums, structured, life, and<br/>\nall of that.  There was an unschooler on this board for about a week<br/>\nbefore she had been attacked to death and decided to leave.  The<br/>\ncurriculum users have good points and so do the unschoolers.  It is<br/>\ndifficult to decide.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat good points did the curriculum users have?<br/>\n<br/>\nNevermind.

(And when my older son was in <br/>\nschool, I watched him learn to hate to learn---YUCK!) They grow and <br/>\nlearn---it just happens! It&#39;s natural. It&#39;s organic.

He wants more<br/>\neducation, but since he needs to support a family of 7 he has to work<br/>\nfull time and therefore we have no time or money for him to get the<br/>\neducation he needs and wants.  We already wasted money on some &quot;get<br/>\neducation quick&quot; scheme that he failed at.  He never got anything out<br/>\nof it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t &quot;get education&quot;---&quot;quick&quot; or otherwise. It&#39;s a process. And <br/>\nit never ends. He&#39;s learning NOW, but maybe he&#39;s not ready to see that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not looking for them to have overabundance.  I don&#39;t want it<br/>\neither.  I don&#39;t want my kids to have kids on medicaid (like us) or<br/>\nrely on wic as a source of food (they don&#39;t give you enough to live<br/>\non, especially if the kids are allergic to milk and peanuts).  Sure<br/>\npenny pinching, living frugally, learning to cook from scratch, and<br/>\ncloth diapering are all worthwhile things to learn and experience.<br/>\nEven humbling oneself to accept aid for a short time is okay.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant them living bummer lives, being unhappy because they don&#39;t have<br/>\nsufficient means to support themselves and/or a family.  Neither do I<br/>\nwant them to make welfare a way of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThen enable them to see that they need to pursue what they love. Help <br/>\nthem know that the ability to learn is what will make them marketable.<br/>\n<br/>\nShow them that you *can* be grateful for even the smallest thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever your situation---no matter how horrible---it&#39;s not as bad as <br/>\nyou think. It *could* get worse. Really and truly be grateful for what <br/>\nyou do have. And I don&#39;t mean that in a &quot;Pursuit of Happyness&quot; way <br/>\n(depressing movie, if you ask me!)----but that there are others <br/>\nslugging through worse (several families on this list!).

Her brain is wired differently than others.<br/>\nHer play is always quite similar to whatever she did in days past.<br/>\nSge used to play a game she titled &quot;pegasus, pegasus fly away&quot;.  Now<br/>\nshe plays one called &quot;Peter Pan, Peter Pan fly away&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat she actually does. She does collect bugs and she will read books<br/>\nabout them if I get the book from the library.  She never decides she<br/>\nwants any sort of book.  She never asks &quot;Why?&quot; either.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are so many Aspie kids who are unschooled. Why not ask specific <br/>\nquestions of parents with Aspie kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nGet her books---all sorts. She may find others she likes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because she doesn&#39;t *ask* doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not working through <br/>\nthat in her own mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old is one of those competitive children who is really only<br/>\ninterested in being better than everyone else.  She has no real<br/>\ninterests of her own.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGod, I hope you&#39;re not saying that in front her her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet she DOES. Maybe she&#39;s not willing to share them with you for some <br/>\nreason. In order to actually BE competitive, she needs to be interested <br/>\nin that one thing for at least a little while!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n 7 year old is obsessed with Peter Pan, readimg,<br/>\nstrings, and loves bugs and horses.  She is interested enough that she<br/>\nwill read books about them if the books are at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe back off the &quot;obsessed&quot; label. Let&#39;s just say she really likes <br/>\nPeter Pan.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if she will read then stock the house with books! What&#39;s the <br/>\nproblem?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n 5 year old will read a book if older sister has read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=--<br/>\n<br/>\nCool. So she&#39;s interested in books.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n7 year old plays with horses (the plastic kind).  5 year old will play <br/>\nhorses with her.  The<br/>\nonly time 5 year old draws the line in doing what older sister does is<br/>\nwhen she plays trains.  Then 5 year old goes and plays dolls with 2<br/>\nyear old sister.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo she&#39;s also into horses and dolls, but not trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to admit that with 4 kids aged 2-7 and a small baby with a<br/>\nhouse and an unhelping husband (as well as kids) I just don&#39;t have the<br/>\ntime to do a whole lot with the kids.  My house is no where near<br/>\nspotless either.  In fact others would call it a pig stye.  I&#39;m<br/>\ndrowning in laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning, everything...  I still<br/>\nhave Thank You notes to write...  I wish my kids would help out<br/>\nwithout me having to yell at them.  (I don&#39;t like yelling, so they<br/>\ndon&#39;t help.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently taught them a new card game because they love games and I<br/>\nhate having pieces all over the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGet over that. Seriously. It&#39;s great that they have a new card game, <br/>\nbut could you have possibly shown them the card game just to show them <br/>\nsomething new and fun and not because of your negative view of game <br/>\npieces???<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThey love the card game and it happens to deal with numbers and which <br/>\none is more (War).  That is<br/>\nokay to do then?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSure it&#39;s OK. But it would help your relationship if you did it because <br/>\nyou wanted to share a fun game, not because it has to do with numbers <br/>\nor fewer game pieces on the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I ask is because A Thomas Jefferson Education seems to do<br/>\nthat.  I&#39;m still not quite sure because you have to buy their books to<br/>\nfind out more.  Every time I ask the TJeders a question they tell me<br/>\nto read some book or pamphlet which the public library doesn&#39;t own.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of curricula out there available for purchase. No <br/>\none&#39;s selling anything here but a wonderful life with children. We <br/>\nwon&#39;t make you buy a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have issues with family members always wanting updates and<br/>\nsuch.  They tell me I&#39;m ruining my kids just by homeschooling (and<br/>\nthey all believe I make them do &quot;school&quot; every day too.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou owe them nothing. They don&#39;t need &quot;updates.&quot; Just tell everyone <br/>\nthat all is well in your world.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m failing my dd with asperger&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nHow? And, if so, what are you willing to do to change that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;m sure my blind son will be at an extreme disadvantage too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sure a lot of parents think that, but the blind are AMAZING! <br/>\nBlindness is only a disadvantage if he thinks it is. Really, it&#39;s just <br/>\na hindrance to some things. He can do BRILLIANT things!

No mean feat for a family of <br/>\n7, especially homeschoolers. Do you let him know on a regular basis <br/>\nhow much you appreciate that? That&#39;s really really important. He <br/>\nneeds to know that he&#39;s not pissing his life down a toilet - he&#39;s <br/>\nmaking his family Possible.

I&#39;ve been there. Cultivating a sense <br/>\nof abundance is vital, though. Right now, your sense of lack is <br/>\nstanding between you and your family. Its preventing you from <br/>\ndiscovering alternatives and solutions. Its part of why you aren&#39;t <br/>\nconnecting with your kids.

Can you believe that it does get better? By allowing my son the <br/>\nspace and time he needed to do the same thing &#39;over and over&#39;, he was able to branch out <br/>\nin a way that was comfortable for him. I was there to provide support and help him find <br/>\nthose little branches. He still tends to immerse himself, and I love it. Now that he&#39;s 12, he&#39;s <br/>\nimmersed in computer programming.

She&#39;s dabbling in all kinds of interesting stuff, and she&#39;ll find <br/>\nstuff as she goes along that is cool, and she&#39;ll want to stick longer with it. She&#39;s only five <br/>\nand still exploring the world. <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have to admit that with 4 kids aged 2-7 and a small baby with a<br/>\n&gt; house and an unhelping husband (as well as kids) I just don&#39;t have the<br/>\n&gt; time to do a whole lot with the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Said in compassion...you DO have the time.

A quick phone call saying &quot;You <br/>\nknow, I was going to write a note to thank you for blahblah, but wanted to take the time <br/>\ninstead to tell you personally how wonderful blah was.&quot; You could even do it while pushing <br/>\na baby in the swing, or changing laundry loads, or bathing children. If you really want <br/>\npaper notes, buy some cards from walmart that say thank you on front, sign your name <br/>\nand let it go.

Would you mind taking this basket to the laundry <br/>\nroom?&quot; or &quot;Josh, I am late starting dinner, when you get a break would you chop the <br/>\nveggies?&quot; or &quot;Rachel, I&#39;m worried someone might get hurt on the hotwheels, would you <br/>\nthrow them back in the bin?&quot; or my favorite from today &quot;Sam! Your dirty underwear really <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t belong in the kitchen floor. Would you find a better place for them?&quot; It&#39;s not all <br/>\nday, it&#39;s not constant and it&#39;s always okay for them to say not right now, or i&#39;m busy, or <br/>\nsomething like that. At which point I&#39;ll holler, &quot;I NEED SOME HELP FROM ANYONE <br/>\nAVAILABLE! I&#39;M MAKING CHOCOLATE COOKIES!&quot; And we do. and let the rest go. But <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s low key, and I&#39;m not complaining or stressed about it, then they are very <br/>\nwilling to help. Sam is five, Dan is three, they love to help. I have the cleanest windows <br/>\nEVER because they love to help ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also have issues with family members always wanting updates and<br/>\n&gt; such.  They tell me I&#39;m ruining my kids just by homeschooling (and<br/>\n&gt; they all believe I make them do &quot;school&quot; every day too.)  I&#39;m failing<br/>\n&gt; my dd with asperger&#39;s.  I&#39;m sure my blind son will be at an extreme<br/>\n&gt; disadvantage too.  Whenever my mother visits she likes to tell the<br/>\n&gt; kids they need to do their schoolwork before they can play.  (What<br/>\n&gt; schoolwork?)  Of course, my mom being a teacher only visits when her<br/>\n&gt; school is on break.  I don&#39;t know why homeschoolers don&#39;t deserve such<br/>\n&gt; breaks.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t let her come over. Put a note on the door saying you&#39;re busy. Make plans to go to <br/>\nthe park. Go to the library. Tell her the kids are busy learning. She has no right to visit and <br/>\ntell the kids what to do. They don&#39;t &#39;deserve&#39; an update, and certainly not details. Leave it <br/>\nat we&#39;re doing fine. I learned some time ago to never tell family our struggles, because <br/>\nthey don&#39;t understand, and don&#39;t care too. They&#39;re stuck in mainstream and won&#39;t let go. <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry for them that they are missing out on a terrific life.

He didn&#39;t do homework except a little in calculus because he<br/>\n thought it was fun. He did really really well on the SAT and yet he<br/>\n barely (as in right at 2.0 I believe) graduated from high school. He<br/>\n had no interest in college- except for his math classes and musical<br/>\n organizations. He dropped out of college with no intent to go back.<br/>\n It wasn&#39;t until we were married, had a baby, and were living poorly<br/>\n off of his walmart income that he decided to go to college. Still he<br/>\n was thinking of how to get a high paying job quickly, so he went into<br/>\n computers. It was five years later that he got a walmart computer<br/>\n job. Two years later and he&#39;s got a computer job with another company<br/>\n that doesn&#39;t pay much better and the hours are aweful. Yet, my<br/>\n husband is brilliant! He wants a better job, earning more money and<br/>\n working normal hours so that we can have normal family relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  He went to school though. He bought into the grades thang. He believed <br/>\nwhat school folks told him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  He wasn&#39;t thinking at ALL about what he loved. What DOES he love? If <br/>\nmoney were no object, what would he do for fun?<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you give your children that gift: to know that they can do what <br/>\nthey love and the money will follow (and it DOES!), they will have all <br/>\nthey need.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I would like my boys to get good educations so that they can go<br/>\n into whatever field they want and make enough money to support however<br/>\n people are in his family (be it 1 or 12). I want my daughters to be<br/>\n able to have the education they need to do what they want to do in<br/>\n life. I want them to have this education even if they plan to be<br/>\n homemakers just like me.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n If you want them to be school-educated, send them to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n  If you believe in the philosophy of unschooling: that people are <br/>\nhard-wired to learn, they will get all that and more.<br/>\n<br/>\n  But if you don&#39;t believe that, if you think that school is the best <br/>\nroute for your kids, send them to school. That mentality will sabotage <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n That&#39;s all. If my artistic child wants to be an auto mechanic that is<br/>\n fine. If my performer son wants to be a florist he can go ahead. I<br/>\n just don&#39;t want them stuck in jobs that don&#39;t pay the bills because<br/>\n they haven&#39;t got the education or skills for anything better.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough unschooling, a child learns that he can learn anything at any <br/>\ntime. He learns that he is NOT stuck---ever. He learns that he can <br/>\nmaster whatever he needs to get what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.

I don&#39;t want my kids to have kids on medicaid (like us) or<br/>\nrely on wic as a source of food (they don&#39;t give you enough to live<br/>\non, especially if the kids are allergic to milk and peanuts).  Sure<br/>\npenny pinching, living frugally, learning to cook from scratch, and<br/>\ncloth diapering are all worthwhile things to learn and experience. <br/>\nEven humbling oneself to accept aid for a short time is okay.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nwant them living bummer lives, being unhappy because they don&#39;t have<br/>\nsufficient means to support themselves and/or a family.  Neither do I<br/>\nwant them to make welfare a way of life.  I also don&#39;t want them<br/>\nliving off of me (like my younger brother), nor do I want them to<br/>\nspend their money unwisely so that they have none (as dh&#39;s siblings do<br/>\nand dh would do if he did not have me).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; One of the things that hampers so many people is a terribly feeling <br/>\n&gt; that there&#39;s not enough - love, time, money, support - so that even <br/>\n&gt; those who &quot;objectively&quot; have plenty don&#39;t see or feel that.

Her brain is wired differently than others. <br/>\nHer play is always quite similar to whatever she did in days past. <br/>\nSge used to play a game she titled &quot;pegasus, pegasus fly away&quot;.  Now<br/>\nshe plays one called &quot;Peter Pan, Peter Pan fly away&quot;.  I don&#39;t know<br/>\nwhat she actually does. She does collect bugs and she will read books<br/>\nabout them if I get the book from the library.  She never decides she<br/>\nwants any sort of book.  She never asks &quot;Why?&quot; either.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old is one of those competitive children who is really only<br/>\ninterested in being better than everyone else.  She has no real<br/>\ninterests of her own.  7 year old is obsessed with Peter Pan, readimg,<br/>\nstrings, and loves bugs and horses.  She is interested enough that she<br/>\nwill read books about them if the books are at our house.  5 year old<br/>\nwill read a book if older sister has read it.  7 year old plays with<br/>\nhorses (the plastic kind).  5 year old will play horses with her.

They can be who they are, and <br/>\nsucceed at that. If I felt I had to prove anything to mainstream homeschoolers, I&#39;ve seen <br/>\ntwo kids learn to read by themselves, I&#39;ve witnessed five kids figure out multiplication and <br/>\ndivision on their own, and I&#39;ve heard all kinds of wisdom and knowledge concerning arts, <br/>\nhistory, social studies, etc. <br/>\nIt&#39;s really not as black and white as &#39;leading&#39; the kids vs letting them do &#39;whatever&#39;.

(i&#39;m more ethical<br/>\nthan this now.)  i&#39;m really not saying this to brag, but to explain that<br/>\nit&#39;s because everything i did, everything i knew, i learned from books that<br/>\ni read on my own, that i feel confident letting my kids unschool.  i learned<br/>\nnext to nothing in school.  i guess i learned some basic math skills.  i<br/>\nwent through higher math because it was necessary in pre-med, but i don&#39;t<br/>\nremember an ounce of it.  i can barely subtract well.  and why is that?<br/>\nbecause it BORES me.  it&#39;s extremely difficult for me to learn something i&#39;m<br/>\nnot interested in, and impossible for me to retain it.  i learned enough to<br/>\npass the tests, and then promptly forgot it...which is EXACTLY what public<br/>\nschool teaches kids to do with EVERYTHING they &quot;learn.&quot;  i was a lucky one<br/>\nbecause i loved to read and i was voracious for information and knowledge<br/>\nabout anything and everything that occurred to me to think about.  but i<br/>\nthink that&#39;s pretty rare amongst kids who are public-schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\noh, and everything i know about grammar, spelling, etc., i learned from<br/>\nreading.  (this whole not-using-capitals thing is just a quirk, not because<br/>\ni don&#39;t know how to use them.  :)  )  from 1st grade on my teachers didn&#39;t<br/>\neven bother trying to get me to do reading/spelling worksheets.  i went to<br/>\nreading classes with the 6th graders and let them copy off me.  so i<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t worry about your daughter.  sounds to me like she knows what she&#39;s<br/>\ndoing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Looking for success stories","postDate":"1176490689","msgId":23155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFFNDY3MTU1LUJGRjgtNDNEQS1CQkQxLTRCREMwQTYxQzFENkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGV2bWV1dStsYmduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGV2bWV1dStsYmduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23150,"nextInTopic":23156,"prevInTime":23154,"nextInTime":23156,"topicId":23150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It just happens when the body&#39;s biology causes it to  <br/>\nhappen.

Though they were doing  <br/>\nwhat looked academic, what looked like something they&#39;d be made to do  <br/>\nin school, they were still playing. Kids need support in exploring  <br/>\nwhat interests *them* not in pursuing what makes parents comfortable  <br/>\nor proud. That can be a hard part of unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My Early reading<br/>\n&gt; child is now 5 and hasn&#39;t seemed t progress in her reading skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the most helpful things someone attempting unschooling can do  <br/>\nis look at the delight their child is finding in what they&#39;re doing  <br/>\nand not even look at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nLive as though school didn&#39;t exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf school didn&#39;t exist, would you be worried about progress? And who  <br/>\nwould be determining what is progress?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt feels good to have kids who are shining stars against some  <br/>\nstandard. It feels like an indication of how well we&#39;re doing as  <br/>\nparents. But if that standard isn&#39;t useful for the child, then we do  <br/>\nour children way more harm than good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile schools want every child reading independently by 4th grade no  <br/>\nchild needs to read by 4th grade in order to be a better 9 yo. What  <br/>\nthey need to be the best *person* they are is access to what  <br/>\ninterests them, access to potential new interests, a supportive  <br/>\nenvironment and parents who have their own passions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m sure she will go far<br/>\n&gt; with her artistic talents,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What if she doesn&#39;t live up to your expectation and vision of her?  <br/>\nWhat if she decides to be an auto mechanic?<br/>\n<br/>\n(You don&#39;t need to answer.

What helps kids spell better is wanting to communicate  <br/>\nand *wanting* to spell better.

Unschooling approaches  <br/>\nlearning from a totally different direction. Kids learn what they  <br/>\nneed to pursue their interests and absorb everything else as a side  <br/>\neffect. With school the side effect stuff is stuffed into them in  <br/>\ncase they need it. If someone is thinking in school terms of how to  <br/>\nget all that school stuff in, unschooling doesn&#39;t seem to make much  <br/>\nsense.

We&#39;re not putting stuff in  <br/>\nfront of them that will lead them in a direction we feel would be  <br/>\ngood for them. We&#39;re helping them find parts of the world we think  <br/>\nthey&#39;d be interested in exploring. It&#39;s the difference between  <br/>\npushing stuff in and a child reaching out and pulling it in because  <br/>\nthey find it fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you saw a book at the library or a TV show coming up or a favorite  <br/>\npersonage coming to town that your husband might be interested in,  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t you pick it up, record it or mention it to him? Unschooling  <br/>\nis like that except more so since kids aren&#39;t living independently  <br/>\nyet. They depend on us to filter out the boring stuff from the  <br/>\ninteresting stuff and run the interesting stuff by them so they can  <br/>\npick it up or not as interest strikes them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does anyone unschool until a certain age such as 12 and then change<br/>\n&gt; over to something more classical?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Lots of people undoubtedly. But if they do then they don&#39;t trust and  <br/>\ndon&#39;t understand unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do is up to you. The list is here to help people who want to  <br/>\nfigure out how to do unschooling, how to figure out how to keep going  <br/>\nafter age 12 (or 6 or 14 or whatever). Sorry that&#39;s unfortunately  <br/>\nsounding rude. What I mean is if someone asks &quot;Do some people learn  <br/>\nto knit but go no further than scarves?&quot;, the answer is yes, of  <br/>\ncourse. But the purpose of a knitting list isn&#39;t to help people feel  <br/>\ngood about stopping at scarves. It&#39;s to help people figure out how to  <br/>\nknit! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232478607,"authorName":"Christine","from":"&quot;Christine&quot; &lt;christineka@...&gt;","profile":"cncurry1111","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Looking for success stories","postDate":"1176420126","msgId":23150,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV2bWV1dStsYmduQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23155,"prevInTime":23149,"nextInTime":23151,"topicId":23150,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m the mother of five children aged 2 months up to age 7.
