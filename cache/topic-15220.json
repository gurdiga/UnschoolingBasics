I just bought a new treadmill. Sarah wants to walk on it and eventually run, working up to where she can run the mile for the Young Marines Physical Training Tests with a good time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  She played around with the speed, the timer, and the distance; she asked questions and I gave her answers. She asked some of herself and figured out the answers as she walked. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  She now has a better understanding of tenths and hundredths as well as percentages (this distance is 15% of a mile, or it&#39;s a quarter to my goal or 80% towards my goal) because she is using them towards her own goals. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Hope that helps!

They learned how to add and subtract and  <br/>\nmultiply and divide fractions. They know how to convert decimals to  <br/>\nfractions vice versa. They understand percentages and their  <br/>\nequivalent decimal formats. They can figure out percentages of numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPast that - they picked up a pretty good understanding of probability  <br/>\n- but not formal algorithms about how to compute probabilities (I  <br/>\ndoubt most adults know that, either).<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve picked up a good sense of measurement, a bit of geometry, and  <br/>\na little algebra - not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, I think math requires more conscious effort to learn - I  <br/>\ndoubt anybody is going to pick up advanced algebra or calculus in  <br/>\ntheir daily life - but lots of kids decide to learn it because they  <br/>\nwant to do so for a specific reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a good story about how Roxana learned long division, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was passionately interested in CATS - the musical. For years we  <br/>\nlived and breathed CATS. I think I saw it live something like 12  <br/>\ntimes - and watched the video many more times. We made costumes. We  <br/>\nlearned to do the make-up. She learned to play the songs on the  <br/>\npiano. She wrote CATS fan fiction. We read T.S. Elliot. We listened  <br/>\nto CATS in different languages.  My mother took Roxana to London and  <br/>\nthey went to see CATS there. It was the longest-running show, ever,  <br/>\non Broadway. And we talked about going to see it there. But then - OH  <br/>\nNO - it was scheduled to close on Broadway. Roxana was REALLY wanting  <br/>\nto go see it, before it closed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I was doing laundry and she asked me, &quot;Hey, Mom, how far away is  <br/>\nNew York City?&quot; I said, &quot;Around 3,000 miles.&quot; Then she asked, &quot;How  <br/>\nfar could we drive in a day?&quot; I told her some number - I think it was  <br/>\n350 miles per day. I was busy, folding laundry, and when I looked at  <br/>\nwhat she was doing, she had put 3,000 at the top of a paper and was  <br/>\nsubtracting 350 from it, over and over. I asked her what she was  <br/>\ndoing and she said she was figuring out how many 350&#39;s there were in  <br/>\n3,000 because that&#39;s how many days it would take us to drive to NYC.  <br/>\nBUT - she&#39;d made a subtraction mistake, early on, and had just  <br/>\nrealized it. So she was a little frustrated and I said, &quot;I can show  <br/>\nyou an easier way to do that.&quot; She jumped at the chance to do it  <br/>\neasier - but I told her I&#39;d have to show her some simpler ones first.  <br/>\nShe was okay with that - so I started with 6 divided by 3 and then 60  <br/>\ndivided by 3 and then 60 dividid by 30 and so on - just showed her  <br/>\nexamples, progressively more complex, and then said, &quot;Okay, you  <br/>\nshould be able to divide 3,000 by 350 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - she did it. And then asked for more problems to practice on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire process took less than 30 minutes, including the time she  <br/>\nspent working problems she asked me to write down for her.<br/>\n<br/>\n From then on, she always knew how to do long division. The other day  <br/>\nI saw her doing it - and it involved decimals - she had no problem  <br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 1, 2006, at 9:54 AM, Trudy wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just curious about how the more difficult math concepts (i.e.<br/>\n&gt; multiplication, division, percentages, etc.) are &quot;unschoolingly<br/>\n&gt; learned&quot; as time goes on.
