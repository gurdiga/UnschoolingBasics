He often asks for it and we say yes <br/>\n&gt; whenever we can. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time, with 2 other kids also wanting <br/>\n&gt; the 1:1 time. I try to schedule it in, but sometimes he asks for it, verbally <br/>\n&gt; or non, and it just can&#39;t happen. He&#39;s actually said to me, &quot;Why can&#39;t we have <br/>\n&gt; time together when they have quiet time?&quot; It makes perfect sense, so we do. <br/>\n&gt; Some days I just need 10 minutes on my own and he respects that and then we do <br/>\n&gt; something. When he&#39;s had the 1:1 time, he is so much happier - all the kids <br/>\n&gt; are. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I undertstand that it&#39;s harder with more than one.

Today was a better day though. <br/>\n&gt; We kept busy finishing a read-aloud, burning things, Lego building. I made a <br/>\n&gt; point of asking him what he wanted to do - go to Target and buy the Firestation <br/>\n&gt; Lego set he saved up for. We went, found it and came home. While he built it I <br/>\n&gt; sat in the same room and read to his sister. When he got tired of building, I <br/>\n&gt; helped him finish. He was thrilled. When hubby got home they played Civ. IV <br/>\n&gt; and then I layed down with him at bedtime. He was pretty content. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>See?

I realize there are/were good reasons for child <br/>\nlabor laws- but  compulsory schooling only seems to be minimal <br/>\nimprovement- perhaps(though not always) the kids are at least physically <br/>\nsafe and can get outside a little more. In my daily life I am repeatedly <br/>\nstruck by the disrespectful things people say about young people and <br/>\neven their own children (most of these are homeschooling families).  I <br/>\ncringe especially when people say negative things about teens in <br/>\ngeneral- to the effect of: oh, now that you are a teenager you are <br/>\ndestined to become even more annoying and useless. I would say that my <br/>\nson, who is 14 has better skills at getting along with all kinds of <br/>\npeople and being helpful and seeing what needs to be done in a situation <br/>\nthan many adults I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that is transition from childhood is made difficult by arbitrary <br/>\nlimits- for example kids not being able to hold jobs until they are 14. <br/>\nWhen if an environment is safe and the young person is choosing to work <br/>\nand has enough to eat and time to sleep and rest and not work, that <br/>\ncould really be the absolute best thing for that young person- to be <br/>\ninvolved in a work environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is frustrating not be allowed to do things because of your age. Young <br/>\npeople of many ages can do real and significant things - they often <br/>\naren&#39;t allowed to. They are in a holding tank where they are supposed to <br/>\nlearn first all things other things which they are supposed to need to <br/>\nknow before they are able to do something real.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of interesting things out there that adults are doing <br/>\nfor pay or for fun or to help someone, or all three. It is a challenge <br/>\nand requires some persistence in the parent&#39;s part in convincing other <br/>\nadults to allow a young person to participate. We have found some great <br/>\npeople willing to allow our son to do real things- he has also been <br/>\ninvolved in situations where he thinks he will be able to do something <br/>\nreal but actually isn&#39;t- this is very frustrating. I do see a trend at <br/>\nleast in our area towards recognizing that teens at least benefit from <br/>\nbeing involved with adults in work situations- which is encouraging. <br/>\nThere are many more things available to our son now that he is 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****I&#39;m glad you brought this up, my oldest just turned 12 and he has<br/>\nbeen having that feeling.

He often asks for it and we say yes whenever we can.  It doesn&#39;t happen all the time, with 2 other kids also wanting the 1:1 time.  I try to schedule it in, but sometimes he asks for it, verbally or non, and it just can&#39;t happen.  He&#39;s actually said to me, &quot;Why can&#39;t we have time together when they have quiet time?&quot;  It makes perfect sense, so we do.  Some days I just need 10 minutes on my own and he respects that and then we do something.  When he&#39;s had the 1:1 time, he is so much happier - all the kids are.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  He has always been sensitive and when he&#39;s feeling not right, it is obvious to all.  We are not giving him what he needs here at home so he&#39;s looking elsewhere for it - school could be the place (he thinks).  Today was a better day though.  We kept busy finishing a read-aloud, burning things, Lego building.  I made a point of asking him what he wanted to do - go to Target and buy the Firestation Lego set he saved up for.  We went, found it and came home.  While he built it I sat in the same room and read to his sister.  When he got tired of building, I helped him finish.  He was thrilled.  When hubby got home they played Civ. IV and then I layed down with him at bedtime.  He was pretty content.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As for quantifying his learning, I understand that by pointing out the learning I was  making him feel inadequate (I&#39;m sure that if I asked him, he&#39;d tell me it&#39;s so.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for all the food-for-thought.

Though it&#39;s aimed at teens, there&#39;s a wealth <br/>\nof knowledge applicable to all ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I read this part: <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I  would prefer him to stay home, but in all honesty, it&#39;s easier at home with <br/>\n&gt; the  younger 2 without him here. That&#39;s awful to say, and it hurts to admit it, <br/>\n&gt; but  he is sooo difficult at home right now (and has been in the past).<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; snip&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Please don&#39;t think we don&#39;t include him, we always ask him to join, always leave it open for him <br/>\n&gt; to  join, but his response is usually &quot;That&#39;s stupid!&quot; or some such comment and he <br/>\n&gt; messes up what we&#39;re doing or demands my attention. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Gosh, it sounds like Thomas is a monster - he not! He&#39;s sweet, kind and <br/>\n&gt; caring when all is settled in his mind. But at times of uncertainty, he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; rude,  disrepectful, angry and destructive. He has made huge leaps in dealing with <br/>\n&gt; his feelings more appropriately, but not all the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like more is going on here than school vs unschooling.  He&#39;s been in school while<br/>\nyounger ones have been home, right?  Do you think that maybe he might really *need* more attention?  He could be feeling wrong or different and if he&#39;s sensitive (and it appears to me that he might be) he&#39;ll feel this keenly, whether anything is said aloud or not. Kids who feel<br/>\n&quot;not right&quot; are going to look for alternatives to feeling bad. That might mean school...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two more book recommendations, in this case: The Highly Sensitive Child <br/>\nby Elaine Aron and The Explosive Child by Ross Greene. Both of these books <br/>\n(though they do have chapters that focus on dealing with school) helped me understand <br/>\nmore about who my dd is and what I can do as a parent to help her. There is <br/>\ngreat informatiion about how to see a child in a different light. They helped me see the <br/>\nunderlying &quot;sweet, kind and caring&quot; person she is in the midst of difficult moments.  I realized <br/>\nthat if it&#39;s hard for me during these times, it&#39;s even harder for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am better able to understand her triggers, her sensitivities and notice my own unconscious<br/>\nbehaviors that were making things worse. I&#39;m not expert at it, yet, but I try to change for the<br/>\nbetter each interaction that I&#39;m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, can you spend time with him and just him?  He&#39;s only 10 (still young).  He may need as much of your love and attention as your younger ones.  Some focused doing-what-he-wants-to-do time might help.  But don&#39;t make it a &quot;learning experience,&quot; just connecting time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of learning, my sensitive dd would be really annoyed by me pointing <br/>\nout how much and what she&#39;s learning, even if she was talking about &quot;not learning enough&quot;.  She <br/>\noften just wants to be heard - to have attention paid to how she&#39;s feeling.  It would be pointing out ( at least, to her) where she might be deficient, if I did otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s better for her that I&#39;m interested in what she&#39;s doing and what she wants to tell me without the commentary. Her learning is her learning and my quantifying it diminishes her experience. This may not be true for your ds, but it&#39;s something to consider. I make a mental note of what I see, but I usually refrain from &quot;framing&quot; her activities in terms of &quot;education&quot; to her.  &quot;Hearing&quot; her is more important.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":40304322,"authorName":"Jen Anderson","from":"Jen Anderson &lt;jen_d_anderson@...&gt;","profile":"jen_d_anderson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: Going back to School","postDate":"1187624840","msgId":25903,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUxMDUxNy43MTAyNC5xbUB3ZWI1MjgwNy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGZhYzhwNCs5OGFpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25901,"nextInTopic":25909,"prevInTime":25902,"nextInTime":25904,"topicId":25866,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, yeah.

It sounds like he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel connected to what&#39;s going on in the family so he&#39;s <br/>\nlooking to school to provide a sense of connection. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m stuck especially by the comments that &quot;we always ask him to <br/>\njoin&quot; and that he has to &quot;demand... attention&quot;. That makes it sound <br/>\nlike there&#39;s an us-and-him mentality in the house. Worse, the &quot;us&quot; <br/>\nis frequently making the decisions about what&#39;s going on in the home <br/>\nand &quot;he&quot; can only agree or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to unschool with your guy, he&#39;s going to need to feel like <br/>\na valued member of the family. When Ray moved in with us, it was <br/>\neasy for me to see that one of the things &quot;we&quot; needed to do was to <br/>\nhelp him feel valued and a part of the family as much as possible <br/>\nright from the start. It may be that since your guy has lived with <br/>\nyou all along it didn&#39;t occur to you that you&#39;d have to go through a <br/>\nsimilar process. You may have just assumed it was a matter <br/>\nof &quot;fitting him in&quot;. Oops.<br/>\n<br/>\nBringing a new kid into an already unschooling family is similar to <br/>\nhaving a new baby. There needs to be a whole lot of thought and <br/>\nenergy and time given to the new unschooler - his emotional needs <br/>\nare going to be greater for awhile. He&#39;s going to need more support <br/>\nand more attention for awhile. He&#39;s going to need &quot;babying&quot; to some <br/>\nextent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Ray first moved in, I was shocked at how little he seemed to be <br/>\nable to do independenly, compared to Mo. Some of that is personality <br/>\n(Ray is very social) but a lot of it, especially at first, had to do <br/>\nwith the fact that he wasn&#39;t used to having much autonomy. At 13 he <br/>\nneeded at whole lot more help - and the gentlest most non-<br/>\njudgemental help possible - than a much younger child. Its possible <br/>\nyour guy needs waaaaay more help than you&#39;ve been offerring him. <br/>\nSchool has trashed his self-confidence and he needs mom and dad to <br/>\nhelp him build it back, through tons of non-judgemental support. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool has also trained him that the *last* thing he wants to do is <br/>\nask for help, so the closest he can get to that is by being <br/>\ndemanding or obstructive. Sound familiar? <br/>\n<br/>\n*************************<br/>\nDo you think there are kids who have been &#39;damaged&#39; by school to <br/>\nsuch an<br/>\nextent that they cannot find themselves again? He was in school for <br/>\njust over 3<br/>\nyears and he changed so much in those years. I want my pre-<br/>\nkindergarten Thomas<br/>\nback!<br/>\n*************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he&#39;s still plenty young enough to heal from his schooling, <br/>\nbut he&#39;s going to need a whole lot of really tangible support. <br/>\nMaybe, rather than arguing with him about school, you can go to him <br/>\nand say &quot;Look, I think we (mom and dad) really messed up, here. We <br/>\nhaven&#39;t been paying enough attention to you and your needs and <br/>\nthat&#39;s why it seems like you haven&#39;t been learning anything. Can we <br/>\nplease have another chance?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, as Deb said, find a gazillion things to do with him. And maybe <br/>\n*for* him as well. Are there little ways you can show some care and <br/>\nthoughtfulness? Spend a little extra of the family budget on him for <br/>\nawhile? Get/do more things just for him?

I have talked to other parents of <br/>\nkids this age who<br/>\nhave experienced something similar- a period of restlessness and boredom <br/>\nwhile their child searches<br/>\naround for themselves and moves into a new phase. This is sometimes when <br/>\na child might<br/>\ndecide to go to school- as it is something new and challenging out there <br/>\nto attempt- especially if<br/>\nnothing else is readily apparent.  I know Thomas has been in school <br/>\nbefore, so this isn&#39;t new for him.<br/>\n A friend of mine with a son who is goinginto school for the first time <br/>\nsaid something like this- he needs a new challenge, and that is where he <br/>\nsees it. She wishes he would find some other interests such as my son <br/>\nhas but just hasn&#39;t seen<br/>\nanything else that interests him. Maybe she doesn&#39;t realize that is her <br/>\njob to search things out- or maybe<br/>\nhe really doesn&#39;t know yet- or possibly school is where he will find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son started to feel like he wanted to measure up in some more <br/>\ntraditional way at that time. He began to<br/>\nbe around more schooled kids here and there. He insisted that we buy a <br/>\nmath text book- I really<br/>\ntried to suggest other ways to meet whatever need he had there but he <br/>\nwas very clear. He has had one<br/>\naround since then and picks it up when he wants.  This is really not <br/>\nimportant, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly he has made huge incredible leaps into the world out there and <br/>\ngotten involved in many<br/>\nways with older kids and adults who share interests. He has been very <br/>\nlucky in meeting people willing to<br/>\nwork with him, and his ability to focus on the task at hand and behave <br/>\nresponsibly has really<br/>\nimpressed people- it is almost comical how much positive feedback he <br/>\ngets.

Make life at home more interesting than school. <br/>\nFill him up at home so that he doesn&#39;t feel the need to look to <br/>\nschool to fill him up. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  He loves to read and be read to, work on his Legoland in the basement, play Pokemon on his DSLite, play Civilization IV with his dad, do science experiments (but not from a book! - from his &#39;What will happen if I do this? perspective&quot;, take things apart and not try to fix them or put them back together (he was in heaven when the VCR, vacuum and hand mixer broke all within a month!), loves to experiment with lit candles and various combinations of paper, pretzels and skewers, enjoys rock climbing, wrestling, biking, possibly skateboarding(is thinking about trying it), loves to go the physiotherapist with his dad (&quot;It&#39;s cool all the stuff they use to make Daddy&#39;s back better, and to watch him squirm!), outdoor activities like hikes with a purpose, bugs, animals, loves historical documentaries about wars, ancient civilizations, shows like Mythbusters, How&#39;s It Made and Dirty Jobs, Survivor, Amazing Race, music (piano and guitar)<br/>\n   <br/>\n  The one thing I would ask you to keep in mind is that it isn&#39;t just Thomas here.  We have a daughter who is 8 and another son who is 6.  They both love Thomas but wonder why he&#39;s so angry and nasty at times.  They are thrilled when he gives them a hug or kiss or does something special for them (&quot;He loves me, he really loves me!&quot; my little guy said in awe one day.)

He was soo excited about cooking and he did it passionately for about 3 weeks and now he&#39;s done - no problem.  He and his sister spent 3 or 4 days making catapults out of scrap wood and clothes pins and hot glue.  We talked about what they had figured out on their own and then I asked how he thought it would have been presented a school.  He had a lot of fun telling me how those lessons would look in a school.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Can you tell him that he doesn&#39;t have to start school at the <br/>\nbeginning of the year, that he could join any time? Ask him to wait <br/>\nbecause you had so many things you wanted to do together and school <br/>\nwould get in the way. Then, get busy finding things to do and <br/>\nplaces to go to make his life at home with you so busy and fun he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have time to think about school.  If he still wants to start school make sure he knows he can come home any time. <br/>\n<br/>\n  He knows he can come home anytime but he wants to start with his friends, or thinks he does.  He thinks it&#39;ll be harder to start late.  I agree with him.  If he waits and he&#39;s not feeling good about hsing then he&#39;ll be angry about not starting in Sept.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Do you think there are kids who have been &#39;damaged&#39; by school to such an extent that they cannot find themselves again?

He doesn&#39;t need any classes, he needs to unschool more fully.  He needs to realize that learning doesn&#39;t mean the painful lessons from school.  He needs to realize that everything he does has meaning, to trust that he is fine.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  But how do I help him to learn to trust himself?  I can talk to him until I&#39;m blue in the face and what he&#39;s doing is learning, but until he internalizes it, he still thinks of his days as wasted.  He also hates when I point out that something is &#39;educational&#39; or that he &#39;learned something from it&#39;.  He tells me that I ruin all his fun by pointing those things out.  I don&#39;t do it in a &quot;Ha ha, you just learned xyz by watching that show/playing Pokemon!&quot; kind of way.  I do it off-handedly, just casually, usually when we are chatting at bedtime.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  And, if he really wants to go to school, should I allow him?  We&#39;ve looked into a private school that is much more open and relaxed.  It opens the week after ps so he has time to experience ps and check out the private one.   I would prefer him to stay home, but in all honesty, it&#39;s easier at home with the younger 2 without him here.  That&#39;s awful to say, and it hurts to admit it, but he is sooo difficult at home right now (and has been in the past).  I&#39;m certainly not giving up on him and I want him home, his brother and sister want him home, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t looking forward to time with the other 2 without him raining on our parade or interrupting.  Please don&#39;t think we don&#39;t include him, we always ask him to join, always leave it open for him to join, but his response is usually &quot;That&#39;s stupid!&quot; or some such comment and he messes up what we&#39;re doing or demands my attention.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Gosh, it sounds like Thomas is a monster - he not!  He&#39;s sweet, kind and caring when all is settled in his mind.  But at times of uncertainty, he&#39;s rude, disrepectful, angry and destructive.    He has made huge leaps in dealing with his feelings more appropriately, but not all the time.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jen<br/>\n  <br/>\nDeb Lewis &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:d.lewis@...\">d.lewis@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          This case is not &quot;the right reason&quot; for classes.
