I<br/>\ncan say &quot;no&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s do something else&quot;, and I always must pick him<br/>\nup.  This results in him throwing himself down for a nice tantrum in the<br/>\nmiddle of the street.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;redirect&quot; method was easier when my son was younger, but now that he<br/>\nis nearly two-years old, he has definitely developed a single-mindedness.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately, military housing has little traffic.  But I don&#39;t want to<br/>\ntake chances.  It seems there must be some rules and enforcement of them,<br/>\nat least as long as children are toddlers and still learning what is<br/>\nright and wrong, what is safe and what is dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like my son to be able to do what he wants - providing it is safe<br/>\n- but I think we are still in those early stages of him learning about<br/>\nthe world around him, and that he can&#39;t &quot;run wild&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn example of something less nerve-wracking is the other night, when my<br/>\nson decided that banging his fork forcefully against the dining room<br/>\ntable produced the most beautiful of music... To him at least!  lol  I<br/>\nsaid &quot;no&quot; and tried to look serious, like I meant business.  But I just<br/>\nended up laughing and figured he wasn&#39;t hurting anything or anyone, so<br/>\nwhy not make fork-music?  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I try not to say &quot;no&quot; too much.  That worked out well,<br/>\nbecause my son waited until very recently to even pick up the word &quot;no&quot;,<br/>\nbut I know other children who started using &quot;no&quot; months earlier!   So I<br/>\nsimply pick him up from his middle-of-the-street tantrum, and try to<br/>\nexplain why the street is no place to play.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even before that, I try to prevent any situation which might make me<br/>\nfeel as though I must say &quot;no&quot;.

There are some shows that are more mature than my younger ones<br/>\ncan handle. I know that because they may watch but then have nightmares or<br/>\ntake a long time to get to sleep.Some are too stimulating for my youngest or<br/>\nscarrey. I want to give them the option to choose but sometimes I need to<br/>\nsay no or not this one how about another one? I think I may have confused<br/>\nthe idea of giving kids freedom means never saying no...like I did with<br/>\ndiscipline meaning punishment. I am still learning. Some of this is new and<br/>\nI still make mistakes. Pieces fit together and I understand and we move on<br/>\nUntil I really understand a concept it doesn&#39;t all make sense to me or fit<br/>\ntogether. Once I do it&#39;s no problem.\r<br/>\n  The idea of no chores, letting them choose bedtimes, when to eat etc. is<br/>\ntaking me time to see it practically or in better words how to put it into<br/>\nour daily lives and I have confused it with no limits. \r<br/>\n  If I have this mixed up please help me to see the picture clearer.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n sharon\r<br/>\nI&#39;m still working on it. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"saying &quot;no&quot; and conveying &quot;no&quot;","postDate":"1091575480","msgId":2483,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMTYwMWM0NzliMSQwZDJkNDc2MCQ2ODAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PGNlb3UwNSthYzNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDExMDEwQzYuMDAwMDAxLjAyMTcyQEpJTS0yV01TVVFFUUpYRz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":2484,"prevInTime":2482,"nextInTime":2484,"topicId":2483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hmmm....not sure what you meant by this.
