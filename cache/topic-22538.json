They had been playing D&D together for a long while.  When they stopped my 7yo went to the pinball game and 10yo (almost 11yo) got upset.  Apparently he&#39;d been wanting to play for awhile.  So I come out of the kitchen where I was fixing dinner to see 7yo playing pinball and 10yo very upset.  10yo would definitely have negotiated a way to take turns, but 7yo just wouldn&#39;t speak.  Kept playing (including starting over several times... it wasn&#39;t that he was in the middle of a game and didn&#39;t want to lose) with a slight grin on his face.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI tried asking 7yo to hold the ball and stop playing while we talked, but he just kept playing.  A year ago I would probably have held the balls myself so that one child didn&#39;t already have the power of having the item in question in their possession because I found that that made them less willing to negotiate, but I&#39;ve learned that that&#39;s likely to send my 7yo into an aggressive rage which really doesn&#39;t help anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I just comforted 10yo, accepting the reality that 7yo was playing and he clearly wasn&#39;t ready to negotiate at that time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I&#39;m realizing there are two pieces here I struggle with...  One is trying to negotiate with a child who want participate.  (Sometimes he does, but he frequently clams up this way.)  The other is handling a situation where one child (always my 7yo) has an item in his possession -- which may or may not be rightfully his (for another instance, if he&#39;s mad at 4yo, he&#39;ll grab something of 4yo&#39;s -- that 4yo&#39;s playing with -- and hold onto it tight or hide it).  I don&#39;t want to physically take it from him -- model grabbing or force -- but I also feel uncomfortable with 4yo&#39;s learning that since his brother&#39;s bigger he can take his things away and not give them back (for hours).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nKatharine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe fish are biting. <br/>\nGet more visitors on your site using Yahoo!
