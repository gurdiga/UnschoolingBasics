I&#39;ve consistently found that <br/>\nmy kids do better (in terms of *not* being overwelmed or <br/>\noverwhelming) if I make an effort to be focused and present with <br/>\nthem rather than get all wrapped up in adult conversation. That can <br/>\nbe challenging if &quot;adult conversation&quot; is the reason for the visit! <br/>\nYou might want to find ways to get your &quot;adult time&quot; needs in other <br/>\nways. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am just wondering how to explain this to my Mom, and Sister...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you spend a lot of time with them?

Are they used to you taking their <br/>\nadvice? Do they see you as &quot;going off the deep end?&quot; maybe? From <br/>\ntheir perspective, this radical unschooling stuff probably sounds <br/>\ncrazy - heck, it did to me at first! If you are close to them, work <br/>\non addressing the underlying needs and issues - they are concerned <br/>\nbecause they care about you.

And trying will be as effective as their attempts to  <br/>\nchange you! And probably rouse the same feelings of irritation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just as unschoolers don&#39;t turn their kids toward a college path,  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean your actions can&#39;t influence them. Unschooled kids do go  <br/>\nto college when it feels like the right path to them.

Live your life as you  <br/>\nbelieve right, let them live theirs. It will help you live more  <br/>\npeacefully with your life if you&#39;re not trying to change them and  <br/>\naccept that they can&#39;t change you unless you let them.
