It is one that pops up a lot with those that don&#39;t really <br/>\nunderstand radical unschooling, that is why this list exists, so we <br/>\ncan expand our viewpoints and understand radical unschooling better!!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those that just hear about radical unschooling it might sound a <br/>\nlittle like unparenting.  I remember when Ren first started <br/>\npresenting me with the radical unschooling philosophy I would think <br/>\nto myself that she was just being a lazy parent.  It wasn&#39;t until I <br/>\nsaw it put into practice that I realized it is not unparenting, it <br/>\nis about letting go of ARBITRARY rules, letting go of controling our <br/>\nchildren.  It is about trusting our children, having a joyful <br/>\nrelationship with our children, being involved with our children&#39;s <br/>\nlives in a very direct way, HELPING our children make their OWN <br/>\nchoices by being there for them ALL the time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on and on!  I pulled this quote off of a website of Robyn <br/>\nPosin&#39;s that I think is very good on this subject:  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;*This deep self, our wise and knowing simple animal being, <br/>\nwhen not interfered with -unerringly, instinctively moves us <br/>\ntoward that which grows and nurtures us.  Just as unfailing, it <br/>\nmoves us away from all that endangers us on any level.     <br/>\nRobyn Posin&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of food, TV, etc. , limiting our children in <br/>\nanything.  When we give that control to our children they learn to <br/>\nlisten to their bodies and they don&#39;t hoard like they will never <br/>\nhave that privilege again.  They know that they have control over <br/>\nthose things and they do that which makes them feel good and <br/>\nnurtured.  Just yesterday I asked Kevin if he wanted me to make him <br/>\nsome coffee (he drinks it every so often) and he said &quot;No, I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink I am going to drink it anymore because it makes me feel queazy <br/>\nand it kind of gives me a stomache ache.&quot;  My kids often turn down <br/>\nsweets that other kids would gorge on because they know that if they <br/>\nwant it later they can have it.  The trick is to make sure that <br/>\nhealthy stuff is out and easy to grab because they will eat that <br/>\nstuff if it is accesssible.  The problem is that most parents don&#39;t <br/>\nmake the healthy stuff easy to grab and go.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes with TV, computer, etc.  Make your home interesting <br/>\nand fun and then let them choose.  Sometimes they will choose TV or <br/>\ncomputer or games for several days but, most likely, if the world <br/>\naround them is interesting they will choose other things too and if <br/>\nthey don&#39;t it is because it is fulfilling some need they have.  We <br/>\ngrew up without TV and my kids didn&#39;t have TV until about 4 years <br/>\nago.  When we first got it they watched it 24/7 for about a year.  <br/>\nWhen they realized that it wasn&#39;t going to go away and they could <br/>\nwatch it whenever they wanted to, they quit watching it 24/7 and <br/>\nwent on to other intersting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, hope that helps a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":236897304,"authorName":"frozenandcold","from":"&quot;frozenandcold&quot; &lt;fivefreebirds@...&gt;","profile":"frozenandcold","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"re: unparenting criticism","postDate":"1140717467","msgId":10130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGR0a3QycithZnI5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10129,"nextInTopic":10131,"prevInTime":10129,"nextInTime":10131,"topicId":10117,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-681825150\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am not an unschooling mom yet, and I am curious.

With unschooling, and no<br/>\nlimits on the computer, do you find that he goes through spurts of spending<br/>\nall his time on the PC, and then other times when he is doing other stuff?<br/>\nIs the other stuff that he is interested in learning mostly learned from the<br/>\nPC - researching the internet, etc.?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I am not unschooling yet and I am still trying to learn how it<br/>\ncan really work, I do not have any specific limits - at least time-based<br/>\nlimits - on my 7 yo sons when it comes to the XBox and the PC. Because they<br/>\nare still in public school and have homework, I do have &quot;rules&quot; about not<br/>\nbeing allowed to play XBox if it&#39;s time for homework. I do give them the<br/>\nchoice of homework before or after dinner, and if they choose after dinner,<br/>\nthen they often play XBox before dinner. Then after dinner, no TV or video<br/>\ngames until the homework is finished. With them being in public school<br/>\nstill, I see no other way to work this out - if I let them guide themselves,<br/>\ntheir choice would be to never do the homework - of course. The whole<br/>\nhomework issue is one of the reasons I hate public school - especially for<br/>\nkids this young!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal this year, preferrably in the first half of this year, is to pull<br/>\nthem out of ps and start homeschooling of somekind - eclectic, or<br/>\nunschooling, or some other level that I find that will work for me.
