Thank you! Thank you!  I  really needed to hear this  today!<br/>\nI just hopped on this list to read(and do  my usual lurking - I  am new<br/>\nto the group)but was going to write today about  my concerns  with my<br/>\nson (that I just found out happen to be very similar to  what  you went<br/>\nthrough).  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome,  Kim!<br/>\n<br/>\nI seems I get the most fan mail when I say how tough it was!   &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*********************************<br/>\nI often lead a parenting workshop through churches I work at. One of  the <br/>\nmost powerful experiences of it is when parents start telling the truth  about <br/>\nhow hard it is sometimes. Typically people talk about the successes they  have, <br/>\nso when other parents you really respect say, &quot;Yeah, this has been really  <br/>\nhard for me,&quot; it can be liberating.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen we started looking seriously at homeschooling, I got books. One of  them <br/>\nwas Nancy Wallace&#39;s Better Than School. Great book, really inspirational.  <br/>\nVita and Ishmael spent hours writing operas, becoming musical prodigies, raising <br/>\n livestock. They never seemed to argue with each other or their parents. It  <br/>\nsounded really cool.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow, I admit I have an easy kid. He doesn&#39;t have any health issues or  <br/>\nlearning disabilities, is easy to get along with, etc. I am VERY aware that this  is <br/>\njust his personality and has nothing to do with my superior parenting skills. <br/>\n But he&#39;s no Ishmael and Vita. <br/>\n <br/>\nI doubt they are. I&#39;m sure Nancy had days when she wanted them to just  leave <br/>\nthe damned violins alone and be quiet. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt does help when we share the hard times as well as the amazing ones.  <br/>\nBecause relationships are messy, and sometimes we (and the kids) are just cranky  <br/>\nand obnoxious. Our houses might be messy (well, maybe that&#39;s just me) and the  <br/>\nmusic the kids like is no longer the stuff you like, and that dish has been  <br/>\nunder the desk for a week. (Why don&#39;t I just pick it up? I don&#39;t know. Lazy,  <br/>\ncrampy, and cranky.) The really cute kitten keeps biting and it&#39;s annoying. And <br/>\n Beth is a crappy painter and there are drips all over the floor of the  <br/>\nbathroom.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut most of the time I don&#39;t care if the house is messy, I&#39;m starting to  <br/>\nlike some of Julian&#39;s music (although some of it is just truly awful, I am not  <br/>\ntheir demographic. I&#39;ve never been a 15 year old boy), someone seems to have  <br/>\npicked up the dish (or it went deeper, and is no longer visible). The kitten is <br/>\n totally sweet despite the biting, and likes to cuddle. And Beth DID paint <br/>\nthe  bathroom, and is looks awesome despite the drips.<br/>\n <br/>\nKnowing we&#39;re not the only ones who sometimes struggle makes it feel less  <br/>\nlonely and scary. It also helps us trust that it&#39;ll be okay. If Kelly could have <br/>\n gome through this, there&#39;s hope for all of us.<br/>\n <br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":78282269,"authorName":"soggyboysmom","from":"&quot;soggyboysmom&quot; &lt;debra.rossing@...&gt;","profile":"soggyboysmom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: pros-cons","postDate":"1105043096","msgId":4586,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyazZxbytkaDRmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGNyZXJjait0ZXBlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4557,"nextInTopic":4671,"prevInTime":4585,"nextInTime":4587,"topicId":4538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I see this all the time with DS - but since my desk often resembles Daniel s (I m guessing lol) - I prefer to think of it as a buffet.

How in the world can you be interested in unschooling---even  <br/>\nfleetingly---and think a child won&#39;t want to learn?<br/>\n <br/>\nTenet ONE of unschooling: Humans are hard-wired to learn. We CRAVE  <br/>\nlearning.We NEED to learn. It&#39;s part of our make-up.That&#39;s how we invented  spaceships <br/>\nand bulldozers and cameras and the cotton gin and pencils and  LANGUAGE! We <br/>\nneed to know more about our environment and how things work and how  to make <br/>\nthem work better. How to communicate and get places faster and heal  ourselves. <br/>\nThis is what we DO.<br/>\n <br/>\nA child who wants to go to college will prepare himself to go. If he wants  <br/>\nto learn to spell better, he will. If he wants to build skyscrapers or be a  <br/>\nhorse whisperer, he&#39;ll do what&#39;s needed to reach that goal. It&#39;s what we  DO.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat are your passions? What do you love to do most? How did you learn it?  <br/>\nWhy? Who helped you learn it? What could have stopped you from  learning it?<br/>\n <br/>\nOur goal in unschooling is to have children who LOVE TO LEARN. Who can find  <br/>\nthe answers to their questions.Who think of themselves as  <br/>\nlife-learners/doers/experimenters/ Who have happy, rich, fulfilled lives. Who  know they are <br/>\ncapable.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe goal is not a good college and a well-paying job (although both  are <br/>\nquite possible and quite common). But neither of those is a guarantee of  anything.<br/>\n <br/>\nThat &quot;never cared to learn&quot; statement is the one that&#39;s bugging me  most. I <br/>\ncan&#39;t seem to get it out of my head.<br/>\n <br/>\nI watched bright, eager children go into school at four years old as  <br/>\nsponges----THRILLED to be at school. I watched them year after year after year  get <br/>\nmore and more disillusioned. Many eventually learned to hate learning.  (I&#39;m <br/>\nnot the only one to have seen this; ask around. YOU seem like one of these  <br/>\nkids!) My child, at 12 was almost completely turned off to learning. He healed.  <br/>\nSo can you.<br/>\n <br/>\nTry to keep your child from walking. Talking. Asking questions. Try it. You  <br/>\n*can* do it! Schools do it all the time. It&#39;s their specialty.

He&#39;s hard-wired that  <br/>\nway.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou need to do some more reading about unschooling. Hell, no you don&#39;t! You  <br/>\nNEED to look at your child! He&#39;s the expert!

Yep - number 3 just signed up <br/>\nfor her first two college courses - a beginning voice class and a <br/>\nmusical theater techniques class. My oldest is starting at the <br/>\nuniversity - as a junior and my second is continuing at the community <br/>\ncollege - this is her 4th year taking courses there. All are &quot;A&quot; <br/>\nstudents. They have not done any school work - no assignments, no <br/>\ntests, no grades, no essays, no worksheets, no textbooks --- absolutely <br/>\nnothing like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal has been to nurture their love of learning - not worrying much <br/>\nabout what they were learning, just that the interests they had were <br/>\nsupported and that I filled their lives with opportunities to satisfy <br/>\ntheir natural desire to expand their knowledge base.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve learned. Not exactly what the schools claim they &quot;should&quot; learn <br/>\n- much more and much less. More about the things they&#39;re interested in <br/>\nand a lot less than what you&#39;d see on the lists of school standards. <br/>\nBut, not even the top students in school really learn all that stuff - <br/>\nthey just memorize and spit it out on tests and forget it. What bits <br/>\nstay stuck in their heads are useless fragments - not helpful in really <br/>\nbeing able to THINK about things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":111733540,"authorName":"cartoontv5","from":"&quot;cartoontv5&quot; &lt;LJeanne28@...&gt;","profile":"cartoontv5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"pros-cons","postDate":"1104544507","msgId":4538,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNyNHZ0cisyZXAxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":4540,"prevInTime":4537,"nextInTime":4539,"topicId":4538,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam, Thanks for your interest.My point was that my husband spent very little time at school.But-he did learn auto mechanics from his father and has a career","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1039032487\">Pam,<br/>\n  Thanks for your interest.My point was that my husband spent very <br/>\nlittle time at school.But-he did learn auto mechanics from his father <br/>\nand has a career doing that(he never did get his h/s diploma)which is <br/>\ngood!<br/>\n  I know the school system let him down as it does many but what do <br/>\nyou do when your child wants to go to college and can hardly spell or <br/>\nthings like that because he never cared to learn?<br/>\n                             Jeanne</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4609,"nextTopicId":4679}}
