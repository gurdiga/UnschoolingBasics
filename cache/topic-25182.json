Flowers with sweet <br/>\nfragrance are advertising.  Birds that gain colorful spring plumage <br/>\nare advertising.  Plants that make bright tasty berries are <br/>\nadvertising.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumans have been advertising and responding to advertising since <br/>\nlong  before there were evil corporate plots to take over the world, <br/>\none dryer sheet at a time.  We have painted our hair and faces, <br/>\ntattooed our bodies, pierced our parts and sucked in our guts since <br/>\nthe first hairy chick laid eyes on the Neanderthal of her dreams.  <br/>\nWe have made jewelry to adorn ourselves with and twirled up our hair <br/>\nand grown spectacular mustaches (you should see mine!) since before <br/>\nthere was MTV or Vogue.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nWe looked for animal tracks or droppings as a sign of potential <br/>\ntasty dinner as surely as we look for a Subway sign today.  We <br/>\nsalivated over ripe fruit or a clutch of eggs or a juicy grasshopper <br/>\neven before Olive Garden showed us fettuccini alfredo.   We respond <br/>\nto advertising and always have.  It was in our best interest to do <br/>\nso and still is.  Some people want to be scared (of anything) <br/>\nbecause it makes them feel more alert and in a world where most of <br/>\nus ( at least on this list) are pretty darn safe, I guess we create <br/>\nour boogie men where we can.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI have indeed purchased items because I was impressed with the <br/>\nadvertising claims.  But like Joyce, I would not and have not <br/>\ncontinued to purchase or use a product that I didn&#39;t like or that <br/>\ndidn&#39;t work the way I wanted it to work.    I&#39;m glad for advertising <br/>\nbecause it lets me know which baking powders are aluminum free, <br/>\nwhich lettuce is organic, which corn is non gmo and which laundry <br/>\nsoap smells like the old lady at the antique store. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m forty four years old and I&#39;ve seen lots of advertisements for <br/>\nmake up and nail polish and hair goo and I have not purchased makeup <br/>\nor nail polish since I was thirteen.  I buy whatever shampoo is on <br/>\nsale and is free of critter squeezin&#39;s (and I know because of <br/>\nadvertising) and I have a ninety nine cent bottle of something or <br/>\nother in the shower right now.  I don&#39;t remember what brand I <br/>\nbought, but I remember the price. <br/>\nAnd I knew it was ninety nine cents because it was advertised.  I <br/>\nhave heard Mr. Clean will do wonders for my house and I still <br/>\nscrubbed my tub with baking soda last night.  I have heard Pledge <br/>\nwill shine my piano but I still wiped it off with a dry dish towel.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that can really hurt our kids.  Yelling, slapping, <br/>\nspanking, yanking, shaming, pressure, coercion, meanness, neglect.  <br/>\nThere are real dangers in the world.  One real danger might be <br/>\nfeeling so helpless and weak minded so as to be at the mercy of <br/>\nmadmen, or, er, ad men.     ; )<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Why is it a positive to not have a tv?
