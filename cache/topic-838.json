My public school days were very segregated, and that was in the 70&#39;s.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSure, in more recent years my son had a more diverse circle of friends and classmates in public school than I did, but that was more about us and our family style than about public school.  Of course, my perspective is different because my kids&#39; family is like the UN.  My dh is Asian-American, so our kids are hapa (half).  My Dad&#39;s second current wife is African-American. His last wife (who was close to my oldest son) is Isreali -- Dad converted to Judaism when he married her.  In our homeschool circles, there&#39;s quite a bit of diversity -- other multi-ethnic families like ours, hispanic, African-American, friends from two or three different pueblos, and neighbors who are diverse.   The same is true of our area LaLeche groupl  It&#39;s not just racial diversity, either -- we also have friends all over the religious spectrum, and of varying income levels.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI do think segregation might be an issue in fundamental Christian homeschooling circles, but likely those parents would control their children&#39;s contacts anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

I mean that she is not taking classes at community<br/>\ncollege, or seeking part-time work at this stage in her life. Her life and<br/>\nactivities do revolve around her family and nearest friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that I did upon choosing to be a homeschooler when Jayn was<br/>\nabout a year old, was join some online lists. The next thing was to join a<br/>\nnewly formed (when Jayn was 18 months old) local inclusive support group. My<br/>\ngroup has many people of different faiths, industry affiliations, family<br/>\nsizes and homeschooling styles. Our *only* commonality is home schooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople put themselves into networks, seeking like minded folk, or people<br/>\nwith like goals. Some of the networks I have been/are involved in are (in no<br/>\nparticular order): my local homeschoolers group; unschoolers; women<br/>\nprofessionals in the film industry who are my friends (from before I had<br/>\nJayn); associates of my husband who are part of my new career as a<br/>\nscreenwriter; theater people locally, in Texas and back in Australia; the<br/>\npeople in my building who are my neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think actually being segregated from society means a lot of hard work to<br/>\naccomplish. It might be easier if you kept your children in the house,<br/>\nsitting around a table mimicking a classroom. That doesn&#39;t sound like<br/>\nunschooling. Jayn pretty much comes with me whenever I go out for any reason<br/>\nincluding the rare occasions when I work outside of my home office. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, I do actively seek out homeschooled kids for her to play<br/>\nwith most of the time, mostly because there is a greater culture of freedom,<br/>\nno school propaganda or toxic behaviors for either of us to deal with, and I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have to listen to parental school bashing conversations (a sinkhole of<br/>\nmisery waiting to trap the unwary not unlike the delicious sin of gossip).<br/>\nWe have a couple of families that are schoolers that Jayn likes the kids. I<br/>\nthink the mothers don&#39;t tell me their school stories anymore, because I<br/>\nalways say, &quot;You have another choice.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel pity that this man feels that his real life is hell.

So you have college prep diplomas and a basic or general diploma, and it&#39;s not at all the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I went to school and it wasn&#39;t all that long ago, the start of high school was a clean slate and that was when it started counting, not anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even really see how school prepares you for real life.  It&#39;s a very different thing from working a real job unless you are a teacher!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew and Improved Yahoo!

I found this to be an interesting perspective and one I hadn&#39;t heard before and really had nothing to say in reply. He continued to comment that sure school might be hell but it prepares you for the hell of real life (ok his bias there) and I have heard this one before and don&#39;t agree... but what do you think about the thought that homeshooling is segregationist?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughts,<br/>\n<br/>\nSherri-Lee<br/>\nLooking for safe and natural health products?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aloeessence.com\">http://www.aloeessence.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":870,"nextTopicId":816}}
