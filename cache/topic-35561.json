Sorry about the length of this but it will <br/>\nhelp to get an idea of where we&#39;re at.<br/>\n    <br/>\nSome basic history     ~      Until the end of June he attended our <br/>\nlocal state school who were as supportive as they could be.     They <br/>\nprovided a very modified curriculum and he was exempted from the <br/>\nyear 7 diagnostic testing all kids are supposed to do.    We have <br/>\nalways wanted them to focus more on his social learning rather than <br/>\nacademics which they have done.     Because we were going overseas <br/>\nfor 6 weeks we decided it would be best if we pulled him out of <br/>\nschool 2 weeks before we left so he finished state school mid <br/>\nJune.     We&#39;ve been approved to homeschool by The Dept of <br/>\nEducation, Qld based on the lesson & curriculum plan and philosophy <br/>\nstatement I supplied (borrowed from another HS parent).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe government in Queensland now demands that ALL children be taught <br/>\nusing the Rich Task concept which means producing heaps of exercise <br/>\nbooks, projects and completed worksheets.     The paperwork I <br/>\nsubmitted to the government basically said we would follow this <br/>\nconcept  (only way to guarantee we would be given permission).   We <br/>\nsaid we would use combined elements of Natural Learning (Holt) and <br/>\nSteiner with thematic projects based on Carol Gray&#39;s social <br/>\nstories.    Also, as he hates writing we will encourage him to use a <br/>\ncomputer and keep reading, spelling and comprehension to his <br/>\neducational level rather than his year level. <br/>\n<br/>\nStupidly I said we would teach him from 9 Â– 12 each morning during <br/>\nthe week and that at the end of each month if the rich tasks have <br/>\nbeen met he gets a reward (trip out that&#39;s fun for him) and that we <br/>\nwill be having monthly tests again with rewards for success.    They <br/>\nalso have the address of our blog in which I complete a brief <br/>\noutline of the past week  ( http://threlfall-<br/>\nhomeschool.blogspot.com/ ).   On the plus side I did say that he <br/>\nshows preference for retaining information delivered in a natural <br/>\nand non-educative way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, My problem     ~      10 months  from June the Qld Dept of <br/>\nEducation Home School Unit is going to want to see the results of <br/>\nthe &quot;rich tasks curriculum&quot; that I&#39;ve said we&#39;re doing.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are very aware that, in regards to learning, Liam needs to get <br/>\nthe system out of his system, anything that even remotely stinks <br/>\nof `school&#39; causes him to stut down, I&#39;ve tried getting him to do a <br/>\nfew work sheets with little success.    <br/>\n<br/>\nRequested help    ~    Anyone got any ideas on how I can put <br/>\ntogether a portfolio of rich tasks that will keep Qld Education <br/>\nhappy whilst allowing Liam to destress and deschool himself? <br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks<br/>\nPenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35036,"nextTopicId":35570}}
