My oldest is a prime example of that.  Red dye #40 sets her off big time.  When we took red dye #40 out of her diet when she was two she became a totally different child!  I actually consider red dye #40 as an environmental allergy that is hurting our children.  I think we would have very differently behaved children if they weren&#39;t getting all the chemicals and food additives that they are bombarded with.  We don&#39;t run a completely whole foods natural home, but I am very aware of what comes into my house.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And it breaks my heart to hear people say &quot;I&#39;m ADD&quot; as if that is their<br/>\n&gt; identity, not just one facet of who they are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I grew up in the society where children excluded themselves because of asthma.  I grew up hearing my mom say, &quot;Oh, she can&#39;t do that because she is asthmatic.&quot;  When in actuality the things that my mom was excluding me from were the very things that would have actually helped me (like soccer and track and field.)  We will always have people making excuses whether it is ADD, asthma, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95670547,"authorName":"Sherri-Lee Pressman","from":"Sherri-Lee Pressman &lt;sherri--lee@...&gt;","profile":"sherrileepr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Learning at their own pace was...college=bad was: opinions wanted","postDate":"1097876943","msgId":3704,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBJNU4wMDY1MEI5WEw3QGwtZGFlbW9uPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhGRUI4OTNELTFFNjQtMTFEOS1BNTVBLTAwMEE5NTdFRkU0NkBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3680,"nextInTopic":3705,"prevInTime":3703,"nextInTime":3705,"topicId":3657,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Pam, I think the really sad thing is the epidemic is in the need to label.
