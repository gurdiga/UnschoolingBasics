I just lost a series of posts that finally showed <br/>\nup two days later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *your* posts were waiting in the moderator&#39;s file here at the <br/>\ngroup. We moderate new members&#39; posts for a while until we&#39;re sure they <br/>\naren&#39;t spammers or trolls---or just writing posts meant to incite or <br/>\nanger.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the owners and moderators *do* have lives outside this list <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;, we don&#39;t always get to them immediately. Mostly we *do*---with <br/>\nfour of us, usually someone comes in, reads, and clicks quite <br/>\nregularly---often *just* after you post, so you may never know you&#39;re <br/>\non moderation (but all newbies *are* unless we know you from a <br/>\ndifferent list). But occasionally, we&#39;re all asleep or cooking supper <br/>\nor playing in the yard or out of town. Then it takes a while longer to <br/>\nshow up. But we get to it as fast as we can! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************************************<br/>\nSee what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":281851436,"authorName":"Hema A.
