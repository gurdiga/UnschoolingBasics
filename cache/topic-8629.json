Ren, I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen all over the Path to Freedom website and it is absolutely REEKING <br/>\nwith great stuff :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDierdre, I&#39;ve checked out the square foot gardening website and it <br/>\nlooks like something I can actually do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also found an inexpensive little pamphlet in a seed magazine with a <br/>\nchecklist of things that can and cannot go in a compost pile.  I&#39;ll <br/>\ncheck out the redworms too.  I&#39;ve found a couple sites that explain how <br/>\nthey work. They sell them in the same catalog.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8618,"nextTopicId":8589}}
