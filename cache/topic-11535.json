Make it easy for him to access things that interest him.  <br/>\nThink of yourself as his partner. You&#39;re helping him with *his*  <br/>\ninterests, not trying to funnel what you feel is important into him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s much like you might come across something your husband might  <br/>\nlike and bring it home for him. But in the case of your son it&#39;s just  <br/>\nratched up more since your son doesn&#39;t have the freedom or ability  <br/>\nyour husband does to get out into the world. Think of yourself as  <br/>\nyour son&#39;s arms and legs and eyes to help him reach out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Similarly if he enjoys reading about dragons it would be OK to offer<br/>\n&gt; him books or movies on dragons<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the situation but if it&#39;s stuff from the library, I&#39;d just  <br/>\nbring it home. Offer to read them to him, offer to watch the movies  <br/>\nwith him. If he says no, leave them accessible and then go get more.  <br/>\nMake sure he always has access to things he might enjoy. Mix it up  <br/>\nwith other stuff that you think he might like** so he as access to  <br/>\nnew interests when he needs them.<br/>\n<br/>\n(**Note the &quot;think he might like&quot; part. It&#39;s not &quot;think might be good  <br/>\nfor him&quot; ;-) Most people divide the world into educational and  <br/>\nentertainment. Try to see it all the same. Spongebob is as good as  <br/>\nShakespeare. It isn&#39;t the what that&#39;s important, it&#39;s the interest  <br/>\nsomeone has in it that&#39;s important.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course take him to the library and bookstore too if he enjoys  <br/>\nit to pick out his own stuff. (My daughter didn&#39;t like the process of  <br/>\npicking. It was overwhelming to her and she preferred to have me do  <br/>\nthe initial picking so she could go through it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and since he likes to write stories,<br/>\n&gt; I could ask if he wanted to write me a story about the dragon he<br/>\n&gt; just learned about?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No and no. It will help to not think of him learning things but doing  <br/>\nthings he finds interesting. Think of it more as summer vacation.  <br/>\nLearning will happen as a side effect of living. Your role is to make  <br/>\na life he enjoys possible for him :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him free access to paper and pencils and pens and markers and  <br/>\nstapler and anything else that will spark his creativity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he has stories in him he wants to write but finds writing  <br/>\ndifficult, take dictation. Give him a tape recorder and let him tape  <br/>\nthem and you transcribe them. Let him use the computer to type them.  <br/>\nShow him how they can be made into books.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He likes to work in &quot;workbook&quot; type books and do word searches, etc.<br/>\n&gt; So is it OK to make those available to him as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anything he&#39;s enjoying is okay. If *you* see them as more important  <br/>\nthan coloring books, then store them with the coloring books and  <br/>\nforget about them<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He also likes to help me cook so as we are doing that, it&#39;s ok to<br/>\n&gt; mention that a 1/4 cup is really 25% of a cup, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sort of. But you&#39;ll never see percent used that way in cooking.  <br/>\n(Maybe in a math problem! ;-) but not in the real world.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo what&#39;s natural to the situation. Often what happens to us is one  <br/>\ncup gets dirty and we need to cobble a measurement together from the  <br/>\ncups we have left like &quot;The 1 cup is dirty, how can we measure 1 1/2  <br/>\ncups?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d play things like that by ear though. My daughter saw those as  <br/>\ninteresting challenges. A child who has been in school might hear  <br/>\nthat as a quiz and shut down. It should be fun and intriguing, not  <br/>\npressure to get a child from where they are to where you think they  <br/>\nneed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He also likes to play with is globe & have us ask him to find<br/>\n&gt; countries on it so as we do that I could talk to him about the<br/>\n&gt; country he found as long as he expresses an interest to know more<br/>\n&gt; information?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, play it by ear. If he&#39;s interested, yes give him more  <br/>\ninformation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut see it according to interest rather than what he&#39;s interested in.  <br/>\nYou&#39;ve chosen something -- the globe -- that most people would put in  <br/>\nthe &quot;educational&quot; category. What would you do if you were going  <br/>\nthrough an album of your old family pictures and he pointed to you as  <br/>\na baby and asked about it. How would you respond? Would you try to  <br/>\nget your whole family history in because you were afraid he might  <br/>\nnever ask again? ;-) Gauge your answer by *him*, by his interest, by  <br/>\nwhat *he* wants from the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":65697424,"authorName":"Michelle Thedaker","from":"&quot;Michelle Thedaker&quot; &lt;pamperedthed@...&gt;","profile":"pamperedthed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [unschoolingbasics] Making sure I understand","postDate":"1144727254","msgId":11544,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNDExMDM0NzI5LldGUkYyNjk2NC5mZWQxcm1tdGFvMDguY294Lm5ldEBtZXJsaW4+","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxZjZ2aCtuMzE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11543,"nextInTopic":11564,"prevInTime":11543,"nextInTime":11545,"topicId":11535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ellen, I m really new at this unschooling path also - isn t it interesting trying to figure it all out? :-)  From what I understand, all of what you are saying","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1105597402\">Ellen,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really new at this unschooling path also - isn&#39;t it interesting trying<br/>\nto figure it all out? :-)  From what I understand, all of what you are<br/>\nsaying here is great, so long as your son has the free choice to say, &quot;No<br/>\nthanks, I don&#39;t want to do that right now&quot; and you respect his choice to do<br/>\nsomething else.

They&#39;ve seen<br/>\nthem in the store and look at these things like puzzles.  Sometimes they<br/>\nwill get one of these workbooks down and spend hours doing every page and<br/>\nthen put them up for months before lookin at them again.  I don&#39;t buy them<br/>\nto &quot;tempt&quot; them but because I know that sometimes they like doing them (just<br/>\nlike they like coloring sometimes or cutting paper with scissors or planting<br/>\nseeds or building Legos!)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also likes to help me cook so as we are doing that, it&#39;s ok to<br/>\n&gt; mention that a 1/4 cup is really 25% of a cup, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSure.  Although I find that perCENTs make much more sense with money.  25Â¢<br/>\nis 25% of $1.00.  If your child enjoys cooking he will learn through<br/>\nexperimentation and following recipes (or making them up) fractions<br/>\neventually and naturally.  My dd has these mashed potatoes that she likes to<br/>\nmake.  There are two packages in a box and sometimes she makes only one if<br/>\nshe just wants some but if the whole family wants some she makes two<br/>\npackages.  She&#39;s been making these for the past few months.  When she makes<br/>\ntwo packages she has just been measuring twice.  So she would put in 2/3 cup<br/>\nof milk and then another 2/3 cup of milk.  1/4 cup of water and another 1/4<br/>\ncup of water.  I&#39;ve let her do it that way because it makes sense and the<br/>\npotatoes turn out the correct consistancy.  So tonight she is staring at the<br/>\nbox and looking at the measuring cups and is suddenly hit with an &quot;ah-ha&quot;<br/>\nmoment.  &quot;Mom!  2/3 cup plus another 2/3 cup is 1-1/3 cup!  Hey that&#39;s<br/>\npretty cool.&quot;  No; the cool part is that no one told her that!  She then<br/>\nwent on to tell me what the other measurements were if she were to double it<br/>\nrather than add the ingredients twice.  How cool is that?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also likes to play with is globe & have us ask him to find<br/>\n&gt; countries on it so as we do that I could talk to him about the<br/>\n&gt; country he found as long as he expresses an interest to know more<br/>\n&gt; information?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe key is that you stop thinking of everything you do as an &quot;educational<br/>\nmoment&quot; and start thinking of it as living.  As adults we don&#39;t (or maybe I<br/>\nshould say as an adult I don&#39;t) think when we get the new National<br/>\nGeographic in terms of &quot;What will I learn from this months&#39; issue?&quot;  Instead<br/>\nI see that brown envelope in the mailbox and think, &quot;Oh goodie!!  I wonder<br/>\nwhat wonderful things they have to share with me this month!&quot;   Sure I&#39;m<br/>\nlearning but I don&#39;t think of reading NG as an &quot;educational moment.&quot;  I like<br/>\nreading NG because it stretches my brain, gives me new ideas and insights to<br/>\nplaces I have yet to go (but have an ever growing list of places I want to<br/>\ngo!)  I feel alive when I read NG.  I also enjoy getting several other<br/>\nmagazines each month.  While interesting and maybe I learn something from<br/>\nthem, they don&#39;t excite me like NG does.  That doesn&#39;t lessen their<br/>\nimportance in my life, just that I use them for different things.  Sort of<br/>\nlike food.  I eat cake because I enjoy cake.  I enjoy other foods as well,<br/>\nbut I eat them for different reasons.  I know if all I ate was cake I would<br/>\nfeel slow, tired, and lithless.  And if I only eat beans and rice and cheese<br/>\nand salad I will get bored.  So I have a variety of foods that I eat to meet<br/>\nthe variety of needs that I have.  And I&#39;m trying to apply that to more<br/>\nareas of my life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nMichelle<br/>\nIndependent Kitchen Consultant #413652<br/>\nThe Pampered Chef<br/>\n850-474-0817<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr\">http://www.pamperedchef.biz/michellelr</a><br/>\nAsk me how you can save 60% on some of our most favorite products!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124939329,"authorName":"Ellen LaFleche-Christian","from":"&quot;Ellen LaFleche-Christian&quot; &lt;scentednights2002@...&gt;","profile":"scentednights2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Making sure I understand","postDate":"1144725297","msgId":11535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxZjZ2aCtuMzE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11543,"prevInTime":11534,"nextInTime":11536,"topicId":11535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been doing more reading about unschooling and want to make sure I understand this correctly.
