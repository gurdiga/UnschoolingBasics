I&#39;ve <br/>\nreceived some good responses, in fact, I&#39;ve connected in the past by <br/>\nemail with both Rue and Kathryn, Rue sent me her narrative, which is <br/>\na big help.  I also realized I&#39;ve got a lot of info saved in word <br/>\nthat I&#39;ve been collecting since I started this journey to <br/>\nunschooling, I need to go back and organize it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s more of an internal mental mindset issue for me, knowing in my <br/>\nheart that unschooling is what&#39;s best for my child, and also knowing <br/>\nthat I will do whatever is necessary to satisfy my town.  Because I <br/>\nbelieve I&#39;m the first unschooler (but I&#39;m not telling the super <br/>\nthat!) in my town, and the only homeschooler above elem level, I&#39;m <br/>\nbreaking new ground.  And it&#39;s also about &quot;not knowing&quot; - I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nrelax once I had submitted my LOI in Aug until I heard back (got <br/>\nmy &quot;approval&quot; one week later!   Short and sweet).  I was afraid <br/>\nthey&#39;d make an issue of me wanting to do a narrative (ie try to <br/>\nsuggest testing).  So, until I submit my first narrative next year, I <br/>\nwon&#39;t know how they&#39;ll be about it.    I tend to overanalyze <br/>\nsometimes!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had MANY conversations/emails with her teachers, guidance counselor <br/>\n(what do they DO to actually help kids???!!??), vice principal, <br/>\nprincipal all last year, kept getting &quot;yessed&quot; to death, falling on <br/>\ndeaf ears.  I emailed the guidance counselor, vp, p to let them know <br/>\nI would be homeschooling, reiterated my concerns about her learning <br/>\nstyle not working, she needs more time to finish a task to <br/>\ncompletion, concerned about increase in migraines, will benefit with <br/>\nmore one on one time blah blah blah, thanked them and the teachers <br/>\nfor their efforts with her last year etc etc.  I included the email <br/>\nwith my LOI.  The super doesn&#39;t know my child from the next one <br/>\n(although he DOES know me as I volunteer to play piano with the <br/>\nschool choruses when needed, the music teachers are friends, my <br/>\ndegree is in music, done it for MANY years even long before I had my <br/>\ndd).  I like to think it made it easier for him to send <br/>\nthe &quot;approval&quot; letter back, sort of a &quot;the rest of the story&quot; <br/>\nmoment.

She hates math because of school and even though I put on <br/>\nmy &quot;curriculum&quot; list (that I submitted with my letter of intent)the <br/>\nbooks/DVDs/online sources we will be using, I have no intention of <br/>\nreviewing the things she had trouble with last year (common <br/>\ndenominators, fractions, etc).  History will be easy, language arts <br/>\nand science do-able.  She hates to read for pleasure, but I can even <br/>\nwork around that (books on tape in the car, reading TO her or just <br/>\nlisting books that she &quot;read&quot; - she forgets most of what she&#39;s read <br/>\nwhen &quot;forced&quot; to read a book in school during &quot;sustained silent <br/>\nreading&quot; time and I know she CAN read, so who cares how many, if any, <br/>\nbooks she&#39;s read.  They just like to see a list).  I worried a lot <br/>\nuntil I submitted my letter, not knowing how they would respond, and <br/>\nI got my letter of &quot;approval&quot; back a week after I submitted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that THAT is accomplished, I&#39;m thinking about my narrative (I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to be writing it last minute and have been jotting done <br/>\nthings that we&#39;ve done, talked about etc, more as a memory jogger for <br/>\nme). I&#39;ve got a lot of samples from unschooling sites, a few from <br/>\nsome unschoolers, lists of educationese wording to use.  This is more <br/>\nof a vent, and maybe a request for some &quot;suggestions&quot; from those who <br/>\nhave to submit something more &quot;substantial&quot; in their states.   I want <br/>\nto be ready to submit my narrative in a way that will satisfy the <br/>\ntown, but I almost feel like I have to make things up or lie.   Part <br/>\nof this is because we are at the beginning of this new life style and <br/>\nI&#39;m very mindful of not pushing her to &quot;do this or that&quot; in the name <br/>\nof &quot;homeschooling&quot;.   Just call it my &quot;control freak&quot; factor, wanting <br/>\nto be prepared.  I&#39;m trusting the process, and I know many of you <br/>\nhave always unschooled, so maybe can&#39;t relate to my situation, but I <br/>\nalso know there are others out there who HAVE pulled a kid out of <br/>\nschool (just finished 6th grade), so I&#39;m not looking for the pep <br/>\ntalks about unschooling, there have been a lot of great posts, all of <br/>\nwhich I&#39;ve embraced (and continue to embrace).   This isn&#39;t about my <br/>\nview of unschooling, only about the requirements of my state.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you can get through this rambling post, I&#39;d appreciate any <br/>\nthoughts.  Thanks for letting me vent!<br/>\nJann</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6516,"nextTopicId":6536}}
