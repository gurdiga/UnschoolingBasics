I have a theory that I have<br/>\nput together after years of looking at ADD/ADHD.  I believe that the<br/>\nmajority of people, especially adults, who have been labelled ADD/ADHD<br/>\nactually are BORED.  They are working in professions that bring them little<br/>\nor no joy.  They think they are ADD because they can&#39;t pay attention.  Yet<br/>\nthey go home and spend all weekend tying flies, gardening, reading, building<br/>\nmodel railroads, dinking with their computers, etc etc etc and have no<br/>\nproblem paying attention.  We also are a society that is conditioned to<br/>\nthink of life in 30 minute intervals.  We are a &quot;sitcom society.&quot;  And to<br/>\nmake it worse we need at least one &quot;commercial break&quot; for every 30 minutes<br/>\nof our life!  We&#39;ve made ourselves distractable.  And then there is the<br/>\nwhole food influence.  Look at all the additives, preservatives, colorings,<br/>\nflavorings, and fillers we have added to our food to make them fit into that<br/>\n30 minute sitcom life.  We can make dinner in 20 minutes because we just<br/>\nhave to &quot;fix it and forget it.&quot;  Fast food makes up a good portion of the US<br/>\ndiet.  Who can think when they have been saturated with fat, cholesterol,<br/>\nempty complex carbohydrates, and lacking in fresh vegetables, fruits and<br/>\n*real* foods?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beautiful part of bringing your children home is that you get to be on<br/>\nvacation for the rest of your life.  Think of it like that.  You are free to<br/>\ndo whatever you want.  You can play, sing, laugh, dance, and get totally<br/>\nengrossed in the things that you and your children want to do.  Don&#39;t<br/>\ncategorize things into &quot;adult things&quot; and &quot;kid things.&quot;  Enjoy getting down<br/>\non the floor and playing with building blocks.  Relive the joy of digging in<br/>\nthe dirt.  Go ride your bike and get into a &quot;children&#39;s book&quot;  And on the<br/>\nreverse, invite your children to get into your world.  Let them meet the<br/>\ncharacters of West Wing, read to them from a book that you have enjoyed (The<br/>\nDaVinci code is a current favorite in our house), invite them into the<br/>\nkitchen to help prepare meals, and if they would like let them stay for an<br/>\n&quot;adult&quot; service at church.  The church we used to attend did not require<br/>\nchildren leave for the children&#39;s building during church and our oldest<br/>\nenjoyed many services.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that there are people who truly do have ADD.

I truly think that if my son had been in ps all <br/>\nalong, they would have tried to slap that label on him.  That <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean that your son isn&#39;t ADD -- and if he is, I have heard <br/>\nthere are lots of ways in dealing with it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I also think that my son would have gotten phenomenally <br/>\nmediocre grades if he were in school.  It is hard to pay attention <br/>\nwhen you already know the material....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll they want is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; more meds.

A lot of folk there worry about <br/>\nthose issues, too.  My son is 14, and although I know I can&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand/teach everything he wants to learn, he is capable of <br/>\nreading and understanding a LOT.  You can also find others in the <br/>\narea who might serve as mentors if your son has a particular <br/>\ninterest in depth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about homeschooling is that they CAN follow <br/>\ntheir passions, even if it isn&#39;t something that schools teach.  My <br/>\nson could tell you a fair bit about codes and the enigma machine -- <br/>\nmore than I know about!  If he were in school, he probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave had the time to learn about this, because he would have had 6 <br/>\nhours there, plus a good 2 hours or more homework.  (Do you read the <br/>\ncomics?  Zits?  There was a series of strips about how Jeremy was so <br/>\ntired, and his mother asked how did they expect kids to learn if <br/>\nthey are so tired from doing so much homework.  Jeremy said that <br/>\nthey don&#39;t go to school to learn, they go to get their homework <br/>\nassignments!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  All children will learn on  their <br/>\n&gt; own schedule has been my opinion for many years,  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I agree!  Asking them to learn lockstep is kind of like asking them <br/>\nto grow and develop lockstep.  My son is 14, but looks 12.  He <br/>\nhasn&#39;t hit puberty yet, but the majority of 14 yr olds have.  So, <br/>\ndoes he need remedial growth classes?  (I say no -- I know he will <br/>\nbe taller than me within a year without hitting that classic growth <br/>\nspurt, and I don&#39;t want to be shorter than him any sooner than I <br/>\nneed to!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you have lots of really good reasons to want to <br/>\nhomeschool.  I would say, go ahead and do it.  They are unhappy in <br/>\nschool -- and so often that causes spill-over behavior at home.  You <br/>\nare unhappy with their school experiences.  The worries about <br/>\nhandling things down the road when they are older -- I know I had <br/>\nthem, but somehow,it seems to work out okay!  At least, it has so <br/>\nfar for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":264026771,"authorName":"LuvnMomma24boys@aol.com","from":"LuvnMomma24boys@...","profile":"prettypainthorsies","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Questions from a scaredy cat.....LOL","postDate":"1144729284","msgId":11576,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1OS4yMDlmODU0LjMxNmM4OGM0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11574,"nextInTopic":11578,"prevInTime":11575,"nextInTime":11577,"topicId":11530,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/10/2006 10:25:25 P.M.

Welcome to the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s normal to be a little scared when thinking about venturing off into something so new. After all, most of us went to school. Some of us went for 16+ years! It&#39;s what we know. It&#39;s what society tells us is important over and over again. But if you&#39;re considering something different for your family you must have a reason. There must be something about this system of schooling that&#39;s not working for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo try to relax and focus on why you&#39;re asking the kinds of questions you are regarding schooling. Read all you can about unschooling here and at other sites. www.sandradodd.com/unschooling is a really complete site with tons of info. Think about what you hope to give your family by releasing them from school. Think about the joy of having them home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was once in your situation. My son went to school through 4th grade.  I was scared too, but bringing my son home and giving him the freedom to learn has been the best decision I&#39;ve made for him. He&#39;s 16 now and every bit as intelligent, self-assured, caring and interesting as I knew he was way back when school told me I needed to &quot;fix&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/\">http://zenmommasgarden.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water.

They are 9, 7, 3,  and 2.  I <br/>\nwant to take them out of school because I don&#39;t think they are  living up to <br/>\ntheir potential and I don&#39;t think they are learning as easily as  they could be. <br/>\n Learning has become a chore for them and I don&#39;t like  that.  I have one son <br/>\n(my 7 year old) that has ADD.  But it is  extremely manageable if you can <br/>\ntake the time.  I do not believe he needs  meds for this.  I just think he needs <br/>\na different approach to learning and  life.  He is a bright and intelligent <br/>\nboy, but that is not being  appreciated by his current school.  All they want is <br/>\nmore meds.  I  tried meds and did not like who he became on them, so I <br/>\nquickly removed him as  soon as I could possibly do so.  MY 9 yr old is a bright and <br/>\nvery  inquisitive boy.  Extremely intelligent, I worry if I can keep up with  <br/>\nhim.  My 3 year old is a normal healthy happy young child.  My 2 year  old <br/>\nhas colaboma and was diagnosed with something called CHARGE syndrome, which  <br/>\nseems like a crock to me (don&#39;t get offended if your child has this!), but to me  <br/>\nit seems like a syndrome for parents to put a &quot;label&quot; on their child.  My  <br/>\nchild has a slight abnormality, but nothing that should put him in the learning  <br/>\ndisabled category.  He may not speak on schedule, but he has been able to  <br/>\nput puzzles together since he was 6 mos. old.  All children will learn on  their <br/>\nown schedule has been my opinion for many years,  but until someone  told me <br/>\nof this group, it never occurred to me that there was a way to continue  <br/>\nteaching my child in this way!<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks, and I hope I have provided enough information.<br/>\n <br/>\nMandy<br/>\n <br/>\n (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185550057,"authorName":"Joanne","from":"&quot;Joanne&quot; &lt;billyandjoanne@...&gt;","profile":"billyandjoanne","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Questions from a scaredy cat.....LOL","postDate":"1144722019","msgId":11533,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxZjNwMytnaGM4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM2OS4xY2VkODE0LjMxNmM0OWE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11532,"nextInTopic":11537,"prevInTime":11532,"nextInTime":11534,"topicId":11530,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Mandy...welcome!

Hyperventilating really <br/>\nmesses up the ability to think clearly!  Then -- take them home.  I <br/>\ndon&#39;t know what ages you have or anything, but if you have started <br/>\nto consider it, consider this: I really wish I had started <br/>\nhomeschooling sooner.  We have been at it nearly 4 years.  My son <br/>\nlearned all sorts of things at school.  He learned to memorize and <br/>\nspit back info, rather than to think about it, analyze it, <br/>\nextrapolate from it.  (He could extrapolate beyond the facts before, <br/>\nand when I realized that he shut down when asked non-factual <br/>\nquestions, I panicked that he was ruined for life.  The <br/>\nextrapolative ability came back within a year -- from a rather <br/>\nquirky direction, but I didn&#39;t care where, just that he had it <br/>\nagain!)  He learned to take frequent mental breaks, to dawdle, to <br/>\nnot focus on his tasks, and to stretch them out.  Not beneficial to <br/>\nhim, imo!  (Nothing wrong with mental breaks, but when a 10 minute <br/>\ntask takes hours, there is something wrong!)  This is NOT an ADD <br/>\nkid, mind you -- and we are JUST getting that focus back.  He had to <br/>\nfind the right motivation and instigate it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe lost a love of reading, due to reading requirements and rewards. <br/>\n(Ever read Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn?)  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe learned how to manipulate a teacher (he never did anything bad, <br/>\nbut got away with a lot of silliness, and really got away with <br/>\nthings I wish he hadn&#39;t.)  (The teacher was very sweet, but my son&#39;s <br/>\nsense of humor and out-of-the-box thinking tended to be a half-step <br/>\nor so ahead of her...)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have your kids home, hug them.  Tell them how happy you are <br/>\nto have them with you at home.  Connect with others, find out what <br/>\nthey want to do, build a fort, go for a walk, go to the library (my <br/>\nhome away from home), connect with your kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what prompted you to consider taking your kids out, but <br/>\nwhatever the reason is, I suspect that after you have been doing it <br/>\na while, you will find lots of other reasons to keep them home.  My <br/>\nson has NO desire to go back to school (though he says he wants to <br/>\ngo to college at some point), and I know I love having him at home, <br/>\nlove the freedom, the conversations we have, seeing his perspective <br/>\non things, having his help on occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;ll be amazed at what it can be like.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":264026771,"authorName":"LuvnMomma24boys@aol.com","from":"LuvnMomma24boys@...","profile":"prettypainthorsies","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Questions from a scaredy cat.....LOL","postDate":"1144713126","msgId":11530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM2OS4xY2VkODE0LjMxNmM0OWE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11532,"prevInTime":11529,"nextInTime":11531,"topicId":11530,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m fairly new to the group,  I m thinking of taking my kids out  of school......do you have any advice for me..........i m  scared........lol Mandy ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1801801470\">Hi, I&#39;m fairly new to the group,  I&#39;m thinking of taking my kids out  of <br/>\nschool......do you have any advice for me..........i&#39;m  scared........lol<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nMandy<br/>\n <br/>\n (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a>  (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.baby-gaga.com/)\">http://www.baby-gaga.com/)</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11698,"nextTopicId":11699}}
