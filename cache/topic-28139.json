I&#39;m new to this group, but I get the same reaction from my parents (especially father).  I don&#39;t agree with past or even current social expectations.  I believe kids should enjoy being kids.  In fact, I think most adults could stand to live a little more free from the social constraints and enjoy life.  What are we here for?  Is it to please the restrictive ideas of others?  Not in my book.  We are here to enjoy the life we&#39;ve been given, and to honor those we have opportunity to love and enjoy along the way.  (Don&#39;t misunderstand me - I do not believe in hurting others by using them to get what I want.  I believe in honoring others so much that I wouldn&#39;t dare mistreat them.)  Usually when we&#39;re over-concerned about social constraints, we are merely concerned about what others think about us.  What a waste of time!  This is coming from a reformed people-pleaser, who was a member of all honor rolls, Who&#39;s Who both in high school and college, and who gained more honors than she sought.  It doesn&#39;t amount to a &quot;hill of beans&quot; if you don&#39;t have someone to share life with.  I was always afraid to &quot;rock the boat,&quot; but I hope before I die to rock a lot of boats!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing!  I really love hearing what all unschoolers say.

I love that<br/>\n  people can witness the fruits of their labor...how<br/>\n  things turned out alright with the type of<br/>\n  interactions/way you lived with your family. However,<br/>\n  how do you handle it when you do try to live a<br/>\n  somewhat ru lifestyle and guests visit and there are<br/>\n  difficult times? There seemed to be no &quot;proof&quot; of my<br/>\n  dear children getting along and feeling happy, etc. -<br/>\n  at least for some of the visit. <br/>\n<br/>\n  For example, we had some relatives visit recently<br/>\n  (first my dad only, then my dad and step-mother who<br/>\n  happens to be a teacher, then they left and my mother<br/>\n  and brother came). The kids were not always<br/>\n  &quot;well-behaved&quot; ....my son lost it when my dad was here<br/>\n  (a complete meltdown), my older two fought and my<br/>\n  younger two were very loud at times. I honestly don&#39;t<br/>\n  hear my kids being excessively loud, but it seems that<br/>\n  it bothers our guests. When we went out to eat..and<br/>\n  even at home, my mother kept trying to make them talk<br/>\n  in their &quot;little&quot; voices as I guess she needed more<br/>\n  quiet. (Truly I didn&#39;t think they were disruptive in<br/>\n  the restaurant or I would have explained/talked to<br/>\n  them. And at home they are just excited and being<br/>\n  kids.) <br/>\n<br/>\n  And my father totally thinks my son should behave.&quot; <br/>\n  They both would raise the kids totally differently. <br/>\n  My father I think thinks rules and consequences and<br/>\n  being tough on kids make them become fit to live in<br/>\n  our world where not everyone is nice. I think<br/>\n  sometimes that my mom focuses on what other people<br/>\n  think so much that she forgets who and what are really<br/>\n  important (ie. worries about appearances, cultural<br/>\n  expectations....wanted child to let someone cut up his<br/>\n  pancakes when child wanted to use fork w/o cutting<br/>\n  it.....wanted child to just sit where told and seemed<br/>\n  almost embarrassed at the amount of negotiating about<br/>\n  seats). <br/>\n<br/>\n  I guess I sometimes would like to &quot;prove&quot; it to them<br/>\n  that the way we are trying to parent is beneficial for<br/>\n  our family. I find the ru lifestyle is being<br/>\n  respectful, treating each person regardless of age as<br/>\n  partners, negotiating to find a win/win solution, and <br/>\n  accepting of children being children (or people being<br/>\n  who they are). <br/>\n<br/>\n  I am sure my mother and father and step-mother do not<br/>\n  necessarily agree with how I raise/live with my kids<br/>\n  because I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them quiet and compliant. My<br/>\n  kids are loud (ages 2, 6, and 10) and my older two<br/>\n  seem to keep fighting with each other. Anyway, I know<br/>\n  that the way I choose to parent/live is far different<br/>\n  from the way my father would. However, I feel sad<br/>\n  that we went through a couple of hard times with my<br/>\n  son while he was here. That is because I wish he<br/>\n  could see the wonderful things about our kids and I<br/>\n  guess I wish he would be proud of me for being patient<br/>\n  or respectful or really caring to treat everyone fair<br/>\n  and as important as I would wish them to treat me. <br/>\n  But he is seeing some of the hard times we go through.<br/>\n  And I am thinking (and caring...know I need to let go<br/>\n  of this!) about how he perceives me and my parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n  How do I let go of this? Just know that I am doing<br/>\n  what I feel is in the best interest of our family and<br/>\n  that not everyone will agree or trust the approach to<br/>\n  life we take?

So, now you know that their voices seem loud to  <br/>\nyour mother, in a restaurant. Don&#39;t GO to restaurants with her  <br/>\nanymore. You control the environment to make it possible for your kids  <br/>\nto be as successful as they can be. Going to a restaurant with grandma  <br/>\nmight be reserved for a time when only one child goes and it is a time  <br/>\nto get dressed up and practice more formal manners.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your kids are rambunctious types, plan to meet relatives at a park,  <br/>\nhave a picnic. The kids can run around and be wild, it will be  <br/>\nconsidered appropriate. When they run over and interact with the  <br/>\nadults, they&#39;ll just have to do that for a few minutes and can then  <br/>\nrun back and play more. If you have them in your living room where  <br/>\nyour own kids are used to doing things their way, don&#39;t expect the  <br/>\nkids to behave according to someone else&#39;s expectations.
