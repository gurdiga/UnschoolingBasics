I will try to keep it short.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 6 kids.  Before my divorce we owned and<br/>\noperated an organic farm.  We have always had a<br/>\n&quot;healthy&quot; lifestyle and my ex-husband has many issues<br/>\nwith food resulting in his being the biggest food Nazi<br/>\nalive.  Everything was &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; right down<br/>\nto the shampoo, toothpaste, cleaning products, etc. <br/>\nSo safe and healthy it was almost insane.  Despite it<br/>\nall, on May 25, 2005 my 8 year old daughter Jossilyn<br/>\nwas diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML which<br/>\nis more rare than ALL to which Hannah Jenner so<br/>\nrecently succombed.)   In Aug. 2005, she received a<br/>\nBMT (bone marrow transplant) courtesy of my 4 year old<br/>\ndaughter Kaylin.  We have been very fortunate and she<br/>\nis doing very well, though it has been a long road to<br/>\ntravel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point here is that life is just too damn short. <br/>\nDespite all the precautions you may take, stuff<br/>\nhappens.  I am not usually one to dwell on the<br/>\n&quot;why&quot;--especially when our focus had to be on getting<br/>\nher well.  But all this discussion insinuates itself<br/>\ninto my brain and tries to make me feel guilty.  (OMG<br/>\nwhat did I do wrong that caused Jossil to get<br/>\ncancer?!)  That is pointless and unproductive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you make a big deal out of food it will become a<br/>\nbig deal.  If you don&#39;t want your 2 year old<br/>\noverloading on sugar, just don&#39;t have it in the house,<br/>\nbut don&#39;t make it &quot;forbidden fruit.&quot;  Everything in<br/>\nmoderation is fine.  It is easy to instill a love of<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; (read &quot;healthy&quot;) food in most kids.  After we<br/>\nmoved away from our farm and their father, my kids had<br/>\na couple of months of sugar overload.  If they wanted<br/>\nit, I bought it.  If they wanted to eat ice cream for<br/>\nbreakfast, I let &#39;em.  But I still have the same<br/>\n&quot;healthy&quot; habits and buy the stuff we always have.  It<br/>\nsoon became a non-issue.  Even the 2 and 4 year olds<br/>\nwill turn down ice cream or candy in favor of sliced<br/>\ntomatoes  or cucumbers or grapes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy children are smart children.  I trust them to make<br/>\ntheir OWN choices with no qualifiers attached (as in<br/>\n&quot;good&quot; meaning the choices I want them to make)  It is<br/>\nnot always easy having 7 independent people in one<br/>\nhouse but I will take it over the alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe path my daughter&#39;s cancer took us down gave new<br/>\nmeaning to living in the moment.  Things can take a<br/>\nturn for the worse and in a heartbeat, you are<br/>\nwatching your child deteriorate right before your<br/>\neyes.  And there really is no rhyme nor reason to it. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nReading about Hannah was tough for me.  It could so<br/>\neasily have been my child.  I read the blog.  It<br/>\nbrought everything back so clearly.  Although protocol<br/>\ndiffers for AML and ALL (AML protocol proceeds faster)<br/>\nJossilyn received many of the same chemo meds, had the<br/>\nsame reactions, etc.  I was very much reminded, IT<br/>\nCOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHILD.  And we are not out of the<br/>\nwoods yet.  The threat of GVH haunts me, even at this<br/>\ndate.  The thought that there could be a relapse never<br/>\nleaves my mind. It STILL COULD be my child.  I think<br/>\nit is a good thing that I am not a control freak.  One<br/>\nwould be a complete basket case.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have meandered from the topic, I suppose.  But I<br/>\nhope my point has been made.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarge<br/>\nmother to Kelsey (14) Jacob (13) Kaleb (11) Jossilyn<br/>\n(almost 9) Kaylin (4) and Josie (almost 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 1         <br/>\n&gt;    Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2006 08:31:52 EST<br/>\n&gt;    From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:barndogzzz@...\">barndogzzz@...</a><br/>\n&gt; Subject: Fwd: Food choices<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 2/27/2006 3:10:18 PM Eastern<br/>\n&gt; Standard Time, <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:starsuncloud@...\">starsuncloud@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Any oil you are eating that isn&#39;t IN the food is<br/>\n&gt; processed in some<br/>\n&gt; &gt; manner. That&#39;s not a bad thing. It takes<br/>\n&gt; processing to get Olive oil<br/>\n&gt; &gt; or butter or any other pure fat. That in itself<br/>\n&gt; does not make<br/>\n&gt; &gt; something less healthy.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; ****Well there are exceptions to everything. Ya<br/>\n&gt; got me there! :o) I guess I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; should have clarified that a bit more. Obviously,<br/>\n&gt; to eat butter and olive <br/>\n&gt; &gt; oil, you have to eat something that has been<br/>\n&gt; &quot;processed.&quot; You can also buy olive <br/>\n&gt; &gt; oil & butter with pesticides and, etc., OR you can<br/>\n&gt; buy organic olive oil & <br/>\n&gt; &gt; butter. I was meaning for example, say, farina,<br/>\n&gt; (and oatmeal too) you can buy <br/>\n&gt; &gt; certain brands and they will say their ingredients<br/>\n&gt; are just plain 100% farina <br/>\n&gt; &gt; or oatmeal but the way that it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; can<br/>\n&gt; (maybe not always, but can) <br/>\n&gt; &gt; leave little to nutrition along with the fact that<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s &quot;processed&quot; with <br/>\n&gt; &gt; pesticides as opposed to &quot;processed&quot; organically.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  just joined a local hs&#39;s food co-op recently<br/>\n&gt; and I was happy to see when <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I ordered some farina the label said &quot;.....Organic<br/>\n&gt; and is complete in every <br/>\n&gt; &gt; respect. It contains all the wheat germ with it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; precious oil, all the fiber <br/>\n&gt; &gt; from the outer bran layer of the wheat and all the<br/>\n&gt; protein from the inner <br/>\n&gt; &gt; endosperm.&quot; There are other brands that, with<br/>\n&gt; their processing, may end up <br/>\n&gt; &gt; stripping the wheat germ of a lot of those<br/>\n&gt; nutrients.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    We are also lucky enough to live near an old mill<br/>\n&gt; (built back in the late <br/>\n&gt; 1800s, SO        cool) that a local family bought a<br/>\n&gt; few yrs. back, got it up <br/>\n&gt; and running again and farms all organic, grinds and<br/>\n&gt; sells it&#39;s own flours, <br/>\n&gt; oatmeal, herbs, legumes, meat, etc. They also sell<br/>\n&gt; other local farmers organic <br/>\n&gt; goods too. Talking to them about what goes on with<br/>\n&gt; the way that our food source <br/>\n&gt; is so over processed can be depressing.&lt;big sigh&gt;<br/>\n&gt; How sad it is.<br/>\n&gt; Although we have never made the kids eat anything<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t like, food has <br/>\n&gt; been a bit of an issue in our home with this<br/>\n&gt; wonderful unschooling lifestyle <br/>\n&gt; and I&#39;m trying to find some balance within it all,<br/>\n&gt; that is, without making too <br/>\n&gt; much of a big deal of it to my kids, which is not<br/>\n&gt; always easy!
