My other daughter (also adopted) has Asperger&#39;s and Sensory Processing Disorder.  What is NLD?  Non Verbal Learning Disability?  I am new to Unschooling, but am finding ways to make it work with my AS/SPD child.  How long have you been Unschooling your 14 year old?  Now you say he does not want to do much of anything, but what are the things he is doing?  What does he like to do?  Does he have any passions?  I know a lot of people here do not like the ADHD labels and such, so I&#39;m not sure what kind of responses you will get.  I know for us it&#39;s not that I like to label my daughter with Asperger&#39;s or Sensory Processing Disorder, but it&#39;s really the only way I can explain her.  Lot&#39;s of people don&#39;t understand her behavior and her huge lack of social skills, and by explaining that she has AS/SPD is the only way I can make people understand.

I wish you lived closer to Los Angeles because it <br/>\nsounds like the boys would really enjoy hanging out together. My son sounds <br/>\nexactly like yours - loves all the same things: cars, trucks, balls, water, <br/>\ncooking, play-doh, etc. He always wants me to play with him, too, and I do <br/>\nfor the most part. Sometimes when I am &quot;played out&quot; I have explained that to <br/>\nhim but tell him that I&#39;m happy to sit beside him while he plays (I&#39;ll <br/>\nsometimes knit or just sit and drink coffee while he&#39;s playing). He likes <br/>\nthat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are giving him opportunities already but maybe there is a <br/>\ntime before your husband comes home where you can do a quick pick-up (at <br/>\nleast clear a path). When my son is feeling particularly messy, I&#39;ll suggest <br/>\nwe take all the messy things outside (any crafts, painting, play-doh, etc., <br/>\nwe do outside so I can just hose things down) or we&#39;ll play in the bathtub. <br/>\nRight now I&#39;m doing a few outdoor landscaping projects in our yard so he&#39;s <br/>\nright there beside me with his little shovel or spade and helping dig dirt <br/>\nor pull weeds, pick up leaves, cut leaves, etc. He loves that and is making <br/>\nconnections with what Bob the Builder does and what mommy is doing. He&#39;ll <br/>\ndig some dirt and say, &quot;whew - that&#39;s really hard work!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, I&#39;m still getting used to this unschooling thing, but it feels <br/>\nright and I&#39;m always looking for new things to offer my son. If he&#39;s not <br/>\nfeeling up to it, he tells me and I&#39;ll offer something else. This weekend <br/>\nwe&#39;re planning on going to the L.A. county fair. Today we went to the <br/>\narboretum and fed all the peacocks and geese that roam freely there.

I would like to learn and my son may join in as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently tried to enroll him in a ballet class. They would like the<br/>\nparents to leave them alone after the second class and he is not ready<br/>\nfor that, so we will probably get some videos from the library again<br/>\nthat he can watch if he likes. The only way he will be going to the<br/>\nballet class is if they start one for kids who don&#39;t want to leave<br/>\ntheir parents, as I suggested. The class he was in was over-crowded<br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has a lot of fears, especially of sounds and darkness. I have<br/>\ntrouble getting my son to go outside. He seems to be very sensitive to<br/>\nthe sounds we hear out there. Like cicadas, cows, trucks, crows, etc.<br/>\nWhen we are outside we walk around, play in the dirt, find and name<br/>\nplants, pick things from the garden, throw/hit balls, play with<br/>\nsand/water, take him on bike rides, and whatever else we can find. My<br/>\nhusband&#39;s parents live 500 feet away and he ALWAYS wants to go to<br/>\ntheir house. I have trouble keeping at home actually. They except his<br/>\nvisits, but at the same time they get exhausted and complain about<br/>\nbeing tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have recently been trying to get together with other homeschoolers<br/>\nin Northern Louisiana, since I just started identifying myself as a<br/>\nhomeschooler. We have made a few friends so far, but I would say that<br/>\nthat are not into unschooling at this time. Though most people with<br/>\npreschoolers are not terrible structured, nor have they completely<br/>\nfigured out what method they with use (like me).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have always practiced some level of attachment parenting.<br/>\nBreastfeeding, baby wearing, co-sleeping, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\ntalia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21995,"nextTopicId":21985}}
