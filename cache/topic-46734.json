And even though he was screaming let me go, putting your hands on him anyway wasn&#39;t holding the intention of invasion. You were taking him to a safer place and space where he can let it all out. Being with family is so tricky. My parents and siblings would not have been looking at my child lovingly and with compassion if my child were screaming, they would be uncomfortable and(this has happened) they would be looking with judgement(their stuff) and i would be feeling their judgement(my stuff, which would affect the way i parent in front of them) So I would need to take my child out of the space so I wouldn&#39;t feel and my child wouldn&#39;t feel that kind of energy. It also wouldn&#39;t be fair to ask everyone else at the table to endure the sounds of screaming.
