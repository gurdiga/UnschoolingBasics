The laws in IA <br/>\ndo not make it easy for the unschooling home schooler.  Here we have <br/>\n3 choices which consist of annual testing, portfolio review or <br/>\nsupervising teacher.  Believe it or not I actually have chosen the <br/>\nsupervising teacher because a home schooling friend also happens to <br/>\nbe a licensed teacher (she left teaching to home school several years <br/>\nago but keeps her license current to supervise other home learning <br/>\nfamilies).  These options wouldn&#39;t be so bad for the unschooler <br/>\nexcept that when we file our paperwork each year with the district (a <br/>\nform called the CPI--competent private instruction) we also have to <br/>\nlist our curriculum choices for math, phonics and language arts up to <br/>\n4th grade and then after that we also have to list science and social <br/>\nstudies.  The funny thing is that although we are required to list <br/>\nthe choices the district has no legal right to approve or disapprove <br/>\nof our choice.  Of course when we moved here I said &quot;what the <br/>\nbleeping point of that?&quot;  But whatever...  In any event, I do have <br/>\nanother unschooling mom who lists Ruth Beechicks 3 R&#39;s books as her <br/>\ncurriculum to satisfy this requirement.  We also have an attendance <br/>\nrequirement of 150 days per year.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIL on the other hand is like Texas.  In fact I would love to jump the <br/>\nriver and move!  They do not have any requirements of any kind (at <br/>\nleast that what my IL friends tell me).  They are considered private <br/>\nschools but their rights are not protected by legislation but rather <br/>\nby a state supreme court case decided in 1950 so things don&#39;t really <br/>\nchange for them over there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKristi in IA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12877,"nextTopicId":12889}}
