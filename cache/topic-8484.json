Math is chess and sudoku and cooking and building and <br/>\nguessing and designing and art and.......<br/>\nWhere are the steps for that?  In school, we are taught in a linear <br/>\nfashion.

Linear &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>\nstunts the mind...I want my kids to have no part of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s all part of our journey as schooled minds.

They don&#39;t even know <br/>\nwhat&#39;s available out there if we don&#39;t share enough of the world <br/>\nwith them. But sharing interesting people, places and events is part <br/>\nof building a LIFE, I don&#39;t do it to try and get them to some <br/>\nillusory &quot;next step&quot; or to cover some &quot;gap&quot; in their learning. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the difference between contrived and natural to me....I agree <br/>\nwith Deb on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8485,"nextTopicId":8498}}
