He&#39;s <br/>\nnow living in a much smaller space with more limitations on his behaviour. He&#39;s <br/>\nliving with your mom and your sick step-dad and he&#39;s finding joy in new <br/>\nrelationships with folks on the Xbox. Give it to him. Give it to him and more. <br/>\nBe generous with this more than generous child of yours. Think about how sweetly <br/>\nhe is accommodating you and your needs. Try and see it as part of how he is <br/>\ndealing with a radical change in his life and make it easier and better for him. <br/>\nTry not to ask for his help for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIs part of the problem about the fact that you are also having to change your <br/>\nlife? You are also living in a more confined way, a more circumspect way with <br/>\nyour mom and your sick step-dad? Maybe if you can factor that into how you <br/>\nassess your difficulties, recognise your own additional stress, you may feel <br/>\nless that this is about him and that it is contextual for you as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you may have to figure out how to get over the swearing thing. These <br/>\ngames are totally intense and playing them with buddies on-line, well, the <br/>\nswearing and the shouting and the saying things, man that&#39;s just part of the <br/>\ndeal. Simon says that it&#39;s part of the game, part of what makes it fun. Simon <br/>\nsaid his best experience when playing was while playing Black Ops there was a <br/>\nlittle boy singing. It seems Draven is aware of who he&#39;s playing with and when <br/>\nit&#39;s appropriate. Simon and Linnaea have the same kind of skill. Breathe and be <br/>\nkind and generous and relax, he&#39;s adapting to your newly implemented changes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196677035,"authorName":"Tina Tarbutton","from":"Tina Tarbutton &lt;tina.tarbutton@...&gt;","profile":"dravensmomhome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Xbox live gold","postDate":"1294202722","msgId":45769,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9MjdVMWN5OGRKOHJSanhFYUxCaGMtRThqd21oX25feEZrNzRRbUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":45770,"prevInTime":45768,"nextInTime":45770,"topicId":45769,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As I mentioned in a previous post, one benefit of moving in with my parents is that we have high speed wireless internet here.
