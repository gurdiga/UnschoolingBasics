Well, yes, just like adults, kids<br/>\nWILL sometimes choose what is not good for them. Do WE always do what<br/>\nwe know is good for us?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy shouldn&#39;t parents control their children&#39;s lives, making sure<br/>\nthey only do what the parents think is &quot;good for them?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is because the &quot;choosing&quot; is really important in the child&#39;s<br/>\npsychological development, both individually, to move toward self-<br/>\nactualization in his/her own life, and socially, to function as a<br/>\nvaluable member of a democratic society. And if a person can&#39;t make<br/>\n&quot;real&quot; choices, then his/her so-called freedom is not real. It is a<br/>\ndelusion to believe you are free, if your choices are limited to<br/>\nthose that someone else has determined are healthy for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe see too many people, these days, willing to give up their own<br/>\nfreedoms, in exchange for protection or security or even just for<br/>\nconvenience. A society composed of compliant people is orderly, and,<br/>\nfor some, reassuring and comforting - this is the allure of a<br/>\ndictator! Independence and liberty are messy and risky. This is as<br/>\ntrue within a family as it is for society as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany parenting books talk about offering children limited choices,<br/>\nsuch as asking: &quot;Do you want the red shirt or the blue shirt today?&quot;<br/>\nThe point of these &quot;choices&quot; is not to give real choice, but to fake<br/>\nthe kid out - to give the child the illusion of having a choice. This<br/>\nis done for the convenience of the parent whose motivation is to get<br/>\nthe child dressed quickly, usually in order to more efficiently get<br/>\nout the door to school or daycare. But this kind of control over<br/>\nchildren&#39;s lives, carried on throughout childhood at home and at<br/>\nschool, often leads to dangerous levels of passivity and apathy,<br/>\nunengaged teenagers who don&#39;t think for themselves and are too easily<br/>\nled by others, or to passive resistance or even active rebellion,<br/>\nwhich we see in teenagers who flaunt their rejection of all authority<br/>\nand engage in dangerous antisocial behaviors. Unschoolers are<br/>\nstriving for something different - our goal is raising truly free<br/>\nchildren who will grow up to insist on thinking for themselves and<br/>\nwill never be easily controlled by others. Unschoolers around the<br/>\nworld are demonstrating that parents and kids, together, can, in<br/>\nfact, set up a home environment that supports true freedom and<br/>\nprovides MANY options - real choices, not &quot;fake&quot; ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents do not abdicate parental responsibility, they do<br/>\nnot deprive their children of their protection and care, but they do<br/>\ngo far beyond most parents, now or historically, in choosing support<br/>\nof freedom over parental control and convenience, as they offer real<br/>\nchoices in an environment that does not focus on limiting a child&#39;s<br/>\noptions, but provides nearly boundless opportunity. A friend of mine<br/>\nonce said that unschooling can feel a lot like jumping off a cliff,<br/>\nnot knowing if you have wings to fly.
