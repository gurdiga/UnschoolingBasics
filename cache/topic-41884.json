I do not want to push anything on my son. I believe in providing rich opportunities and let him pick what he likes but it is very important for him to learn both languages because my family lives here in LA and their English is limited, especially my dad. So, he needs to be able to speak both, since my husband doesn&#39;t speak Spanish and we live in the US. <br/>\nI guess I, myself, answer that question. I am bilingual since I moved in the USA when I was 22 in 1999. I can read/write and speak both languages and my only contact to English before US was the TV and some in high school.

However, we both make a point to read and bring life in from both languages. She also understands that daddy has French words and mommy has English words. But her English is a bit more advanced because I spend more time with her overall and we play with friends in English. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat language do you and your husband speak at home? That alone has a huge bearing on the language of choice for kids. You may find also that your son will at some point not want to even speak in Spanish. A friend went through that even though she spoke Spanish 100% of the time to him, her and her husband spoke in English and he had English outside. She would have to literally rush the Spanish and then say it in English. So he naturally gravitated towards English because that was what he heard the majority of the time and what he used to communicate with friends. You may eventually find that you want to spend time in Argentine simply to be sure his Spanish is coming along :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHave your husband spend time reading with him as well and playing math games or incorporating numbers etc. Just make it fun and go with the flow. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso one thing I did was read a lot about raising bilingual kids. While those resources weren&#39;t necessarily unschooly, they gave me a lot more insight into how kids minds function in bilingual or multilingual households. <br/>\n<br/>\nLaura Z<br/>\nhttp://arippleintheocean.typepad.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com, Monica Van Stelton &lt;tatyland_usa@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi ALex,<br/>\n&gt; hahaha!!
