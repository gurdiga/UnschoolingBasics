My children and I have been gradually introducing more <br/>\ntypes of food into our home and today they reminded me of the book &#39;The Hungry <br/>\nCaterpillar&#39; by Eric Carle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 3 yr old daughter and I went to the supermarket and almost everything that she put in <br/>\nthe cart remained there. ( I am still not all the way but getting there).  Within 2 hours of <br/>\ngetting home she had eaten:<br/>\n3 lollipops with bubblegum inside.<br/>\n1 Yogurt smoothie<br/>\nSome of my baby Spinach/Mushroom salad<br/>\n1/2 pack of Goldfish<br/>\nA small box of strawberry soy milk<br/>\nSome pieces of Chocolate<br/>\n1/2 of a Palmier (a kind of pastry)<br/>\n1 slice of Monterey Jack cheese<br/>\n6 slices of Veggie Ham<br/>\nA few bites of a strawberry lollie<br/>\nStuffed olives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s what I saw - there may be more.  She was certainly getting into trying the <br/>\ndifferent things, putting them half-eaten into the fridge, switching to something else, <br/>\ngoing back to the original food, and more.  It was quite interesting to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old son, on the other hand, is going to take some time to remove the internal <br/>\nvoice of restriction.  I can see that he is holding himself back and trying to limit his <br/>\nenjoyment of the &#39;junky&#39; items.  He even said that he doesn&#39;t like me buying all of this stuff <br/>\nand that he prefers if it is not around.  I am not necessarily seeing this as a sign of his <br/>\n&#39;clarity&#39; around food.  I think that he probably had to rationalize all the restrictions and <br/>\nnow can&#39;t let himself go.  It was a bit sad to see how he was struggling (it showed on his <br/>\nface and in his taking something and putting it back and then taking it again).  I said <br/>\nnothing and I&#39;m just going to continue to let this thing unfold.  I trust that it will get <br/>\nfigured out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the main challenge remains that in a small community where when I go to the <br/>\ngrocery store I see 20 people that I know - and there are others who know me from <br/>\nhealthy eating TV shows - I continue to feel a bit self-conscious.  In a small place you are <br/>\nmuch more visible and I am sometimes &#39;relied&#39; on to show the direction around food.  <br/>\nAnyhow, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get accustomed.<br/>\nGillian<br/>\n<br/>\nGillian</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35058,"nextTopicId":15004}}
