I&#39;m not a fan of  <br/>\n&quot;tests&quot;. I need to make up an list of what he knows now (boy, is that ever <br/>\nhard  to go into &quot;school&quot; mode to think of everything he &quot;knows&quot; per subject!) <br/>\nand  then will go along as he learned something new. We&#39;ll see how it turns out. <br/>\n Right now he&#39;s playing with the big Legos that the girls dumped out all over <br/>\nthe  living room.
