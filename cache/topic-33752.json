I have learned a lot so far and look forward<br/>\nto learning even more.  I have not called it babysitting except for in my<br/>\ninitial email and I wouldn&#39;t call it that when describing it to Seth (he<br/>\nwould make that determination on his own).  I have also heard many stories<br/>\nof people saying the kid(s) are 15 and either getting away with it OR the<br/>\nmost extreme was that the child was connecting flights and they asked for<br/>\nher ID, when she couldn&#39;t produce proof of being 15 they held her at the<br/>\nairport until her father flew to get her and escort her to her final<br/>\ndestination.  It ended up costing the family much more than the fee they<br/>\nwere trying to avoid.  <br/>\nMy biggest beef with the escort is the cost.  I understand the protection<br/>\nand peace of mind it might provide and that it is kind of a CYA thing for<br/>\nthe airlines but Seth is fully capable of flying alone and overcoming any<br/>\nhiccups that might happen along the way.  Since I know he will do just fine<br/>\non his own, I find it irritating that we would have to pay a fee just<br/>\nbecause they think we need it - let us make that determination.  If we had<br/>\nthe &quot;extra&quot; $200 laying around it wouldn&#39;t be this huge of a deal but with<br/>\nbuying a house, a baby on the way and the rising cost of everything - $200<br/>\nis a big deal when it is not a necessity. There has been mention of a<br/>\npossible waiver and I will look into that as well.  <br/>\nI have looked online at several of the airlines and there are at least 3<br/>\nthat do require the &#39;escort&#39; and the fees have been the same ($100 each<br/>\nway).  But there are 2 so far that don&#39;t require it for those over 11 or 12<br/>\n(Seth will be 14 at time of travel).  One is Southwest but they do not fly<br/>\ninto Eugene, OR - it doesn&#39;t rule them out, rather it opens options of<br/>\npossibly finding other campers coming from Portland that are willing to<br/>\ntransport him to and from camp.  The other is United and they do fly into<br/>\nEugene, OR making them an easier choice though not necessarily the best.  <br/>\nI still have a ton of research to do, connections to make (I did request<br/>\njoining the Portland, OR Unschooling yahoo group and will be contacting NBTS<br/>\ncampers in the Portland area), and discussions to have.  I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>\ncome this far so quickly without everyone&#39;s input and I am so very grateful!<br/>\nThanks again to everyone.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Utmost Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nFunschooling Mom to Seth (13) , Aden (3) & Baby Putnam (arriving 8/08)<br/>\nFunloving Wife to Chet (7/4/04) <br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/\">http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; My New Blogspot<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/</a>&gt; Funschooling Young Individuals:<br/>\nFYI-OKC<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/</a>&gt; OKC Metro Teen Group - OAHAT<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am of a &quot;free-lance educator&quot; variety.

(xposted)<br/>\n <br/>\nSeth is going to NBTSC this year (in Oregon) and we are discovering that for<br/>\na minor under 15 to travel alone (unaccompanied minor) the airlines require<br/>\nan additional fee of $100 both ways and will escort the kids from gate to<br/>\ngate and basically babysit them.  All that would be great if Seth weren&#39;t a<br/>\npretty independent and competent kid who will be 14 at the time of travel<br/>\nand would find having a babysitter appalling.  My first inclination is to<br/>\njust say he is 15 and hope for the best but I worry that they will ask for<br/>\nbirth certificate for proof.  I am wondering if anyone here has experience<br/>\nwith this or knows someone who does?  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Utmost Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nFunschooling Mom to Seth (13) , Aden (3) & Baby Putnam (arriving 8/08)<br/>\nFunloving Wife to Chet (7/4/04) <br/>\nMy New Blogspot &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/\">http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; <br/>\nFunschooling &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/</a>&gt;  Young Individuals:<br/>\nFYI-OKC<br/>\nOKC Metro Teen Group - OAHAT &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I am of a &quot;free-lance educator&quot; variety.
