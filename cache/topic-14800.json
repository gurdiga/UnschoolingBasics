It&#39;s called &quot;Mommy Time&quot; (we<br/>\nalso have &quot;Daddy Time&quot; but it is a bit different from &quot;Mommy Time&quot;)<br/>\nMommy Time is usually initiated by the child and it is my clue that I<br/>\nhave a child that has something that needs working out.  It may not<br/>\nhappen verbally, but there is something going on that this child needs<br/>\ntime with just me in order to work something through.  I usually<br/>\nnotice after one of these Mommy Times some sort of change in the child<br/>\n- whether developmentally, physically, comprehensively, emotionally,<br/>\netc.  Sometimes I initiate Mommy Time in little spurts such as &quot;I need<br/>\nto run to the store, would you like to join me?&quot;  It&#39;s nothing special<br/>\nor grand, just time with mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also highly recommend it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nMichelle<br/>\naka Melbrigða<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com\">http://eventualknitting.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MedHS@yahoogroups.com\">MedHS@yahoogroups.com</a> - Homeschooling for the Medieval Recreationist</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"not OT--having more kids","postDate":"1150777256","msgId":14800,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGU3N3QzOCtzOWVyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14804,"prevInTime":14799,"nextInTime":14801,"topicId":14800,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-93088440\">~&lt;&lt; We do everything together as a group- I don&#39;t take one child at a<br/>\ntime for a &quot;special outing&quot; or for &quot;boy&#39;s day out&quot; or &quot;girl&#39;s day out&quot;.~<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do.<br/>\nI highly recommend outings with children one on one.
