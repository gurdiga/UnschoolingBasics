So we get Rice  <br/>\nDream instead of Ice Cream - for example. Some of the stuff we get is  <br/>\nREALLY good and everybody loves it - but it IS more expensive. I&#39;d  <br/>\nrather get regular ice cream sandwiches for others and keep the  <br/>\ntofuti cuties for Roya and me AND I admit it can be annoying when I  <br/>\nopen the freezer and it is full of ice cream, but the soy or rice- <br/>\nbased stuff is empty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I get the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other members of our family realizes that if there is ice cream  <br/>\nand Rice Dream in the freezer - those of us with allergies will get  <br/>\nthe short end of the stick if they eat the Rice Dream and leave the  <br/>\nice cream. So they just won&#39;t do that to us. They might have a bit of  <br/>\nit, but they wouldn&#39;t clean us out. One of my other kids asked me to  <br/>\nget her one certain type of Rice Dream that she really likes. That&#39;s  <br/>\nfine - it is all a process - the goal is to be as considerate and  <br/>\nkind to each other as possible - not to get the most ice cream &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill - it might be useful to you to think of this in terms of  <br/>\neverybody &quot;getting&quot; what they need - rather than in terms of what is  <br/>\n&quot;fair&quot; -- that word, &quot;fair,&quot; has a lot of baggage for most people.   <br/>\nJust a little perspective change....<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":205483142,"authorName":"Melissa","from":"Melissa &lt;autismhelp@...&gt;","profile":"multimomma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Food limits","postDate":"1152566607","msgId":15556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3QkRENTJBLTM4NEEtNEJEQi05NTRELTk1NEU0OEM5MkZENEBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGU4dWNxMSs5N3ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGU4dWNxMSs5N3ZqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":15552,"nextInTopic":15560,"prevInTime":15555,"nextInTime":15557,"topicId":15547,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Okay, the rest of the paragraph was important to discussion.

We have  <br/>\nthree kids with food allergies, one to corn products, two have celiac  <br/>\ndisease, both potentially fatal. So when we talk about food that is  <br/>\nfair or not fair, we&#39;re discussing that Sam and Dan can only have  <br/>\nfood with no wheat starch, gluten, germ, etc. So yes, it&#39;s fair that  <br/>\nRachel and Emily eat the regular graham crackers, and leave the wheat  <br/>\nfree ones for Sam and Dan. They are asking because they want to be  <br/>\nfair to their brothers, they want to ensure that they are not eating  <br/>\nthe safe food.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople in our family get what they want to a certain extent. We work  <br/>\nvery hard to provide alternatives to what is available to everyone  <br/>\nelse. It does not have to do with controlling portions or exact  <br/>\namounts, it has to do with not eating all the food that is safe for  <br/>\nthe boys, or if Breanna can only have goldfish, it&#39;s really uncool to  <br/>\neat all the goldfish, leaving only crackers and snacks with corn  <br/>\nstarch and corn syrup. Hopefully that will make things more clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families go all wheat free, but honestly that will not work.  <br/>\nWhen the generic graham crackers are a dollar a box, the wheat-free  <br/>\nones are approximately $12 for the same amount. So we buy a box of  <br/>\nwheat free for the boys, a box of corn free for Bre, and a couple of  <br/>\nboxes for everyone else.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose<br/>\n<br/>\nshare our lives at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma\">http://360.yahoo.com/multimomma</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 10, 2006, at 3:20 PM, Ren Allen wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; ~I&#39;m sure if any RU&#39;ers heard our house, they would be<br/>\n&gt; uncomfortable, but it&#39;s not really from control, it&#39;s from everyone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; concern that things are fair for everyone.~<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Controlling food for children is what leads to the idea of &quot;fair&quot; or<br/>\n&gt; &quot;not fair&quot;.
