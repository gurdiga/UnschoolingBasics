I think it&#39;s more the <br/>\nmoms that need the interaction than the kids.  I know that&#39;s the case <br/>\nfor me.  I needed to get out and talk with other adults, so it was just <br/>\neasier to do it with moms that had kids who were the same age.  If you <br/>\nreally watch 2yos playing, they&#39;re really playing independently, or <br/>\nside-by-side and not really &quot;with each other.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just at a playdate on Wednesday with a bunch of other moms I <br/>\nknow.  All of the kids, except for my oldest, were under 3.  All of <br/>\ntheir older kids were either at preschool or Kindergarten.  If you <br/>\nwatched, the kids played independently.  None of them said, &quot;Let&#39;s go <br/>\nblow bubbles together,&quot; but when a mom started blowing the bubbles, a <br/>\nfew of them came over to play with the bubbles, but none of them grabbed <br/>\nanother kid and pulled them over to play with the bubbles.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I don&#39;t think kids *want* or *need* to play with other kids <br/>\nuntil they are older, like 4 or 5, depending on their verbal skills and <br/>\ntheir maturity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, listen to your gut!

You should be doing. You need to be right  <br/>\nthere next to her at all times because you&#39;ve chosen to put her in a  <br/>\nsocial situation she isn&#39;t ready to handle. It&#39;s your responsibility  <br/>\nto prevent her from hitting either by not putting her near children  <br/>\nshe can hit or being right there paying attention. Treat this as  <br/>\nthough it were a busy road next to a playground that she had a  <br/>\npenchant for running towards. You wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Well, I try to stop  <br/>\nher but it isn&#39;t always easy.&quot; You either don&#39;t go to that playground  <br/>\nor you get better at being on top of her keeping her safe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also try to take this into consideration, but even if one of  <br/>\n&gt; those is the<br/>\n&gt; culprit I feel she needs to learn that it&#39;s never okay to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is your sticking point. You&#39;re trying to teach her but  <br/>\nshe isn&#39;t ready. She may understand your words but she isn&#39;t ready to  <br/>\nmake rational decisions about the emotions that well up in her. Which  <br/>\nmeans she isn&#39;t ready to learn. Do give her information. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nneed to be an explanation. No is good in this case. Let the actions  <br/>\n-- removing yourself, your husband or her -- speak.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the times you may have had more cookies than you really  <br/>\nwanted, or read longer than you meant to, or zoned in front of the  <br/>\nTV, or spent more than you thought you should on something, or got  <br/>\nmore angry than a situation called for. You&#39;ve had 20+ years of  <br/>\npractice and still haven&#39;t entirely mastered your emotional  <br/>\nresponses. And you&#39;re expecting better from your daughter after only  <br/>\n2.5 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If I were to drop playgroups, I think I&#39;d go crazy. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It needs to be about and for your daughter. If you have needs to  <br/>\nconnect with other adults or to be away to refresh, you&#39;ll need to  <br/>\nfind another way, one that isn&#39;t at your daughter&#39;s or other  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s expense. (Ask on the list!

Ask what other parents have done  <br/>\nwith emotional 2 yos. Unless you&#39;re asking about hitting then I don&#39;t  <br/>\nthink she needs cooling off. She needs more of what others have  <br/>\nsuggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is *really* hard not to judge kids abilities by their verbal  <br/>\nabilities. I&#39;ve done it with my daughter without her being verbally  <br/>\nprecoscious, just with age average abilties.
