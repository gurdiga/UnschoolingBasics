There&#39;s nothing wrong with <br/>\nthat but it&#39;s not unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious though,.... what happens if she wants to stay on the <br/>\ncomputer for 90 minutes or she doesn&#39;t feel like reading the bible <br/>\none day. And also, what happens if she wants to cook on Wednesday? <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand I&#39;m not finding fault with what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;m <br/>\nonly questioning the use of the word unschooling in your <br/>\ndescription. You said it&#39;s a combination of unschooling and relaxed <br/>\nhomeschooling and I&#39;m guessing that the relaxed homeschooling part <br/>\nis what you posted, the scheduled and required school work and the <br/>\nunschooling part is letting her do whatever she wants from 11:30 on. <br/>\nThe first part is correct, that seems like relaxed/eclectic <br/>\nhomeschooling BUT the other part is not unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;d like to move towards unschooling, you&#39;ve come to the right <br/>\nplace. <br/>\n<br/>\n~ Joanne ~<br/>\nMom to Jacqueline (7), Shawna (10) & Cimion (13)<br/>\nAdopted into our hearts October 30, 2003<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/\">http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":131056296,"authorName":"Deana Brown","from":"Deana Brown &lt;squeekyme@...&gt;","profile":"deanabrown1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"New member unsure if i posted before","postDate":"1142523567","msgId":10828,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ0MTk4NkFGLjEwMDA5MDhAY2hhcnRlci5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":10832,"prevInTime":10827,"nextInTime":10829,"topicId":10828,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello I am not sure if i had posted a newcommer message or not to this list since I belong to a few lists.
