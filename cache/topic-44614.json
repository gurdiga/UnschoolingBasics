My <br/>\nintention is to create a space for unschoolers/radical unschoolers (and <br/>\nthose of similar mind, open to, and/or interested in unschooling) to be <br/>\ntogether informally for a couple days.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are invited to come camp for the weekend. We live just outside the <br/>\npark and the sites are about a half mile walk/bike ride from our home <br/>\nvia a park road that empties out into our neighborhood. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have reserved  site  #28 loop 1 for Friday-Sunday, Sept 17-19. There <br/>\nare currently numerous vacant sites immediately adjacent to ours that <br/>\nyou can reserve at the link below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a self-directed weekend where you&#39;ll need to bring everything <br/>\nyou need or want with you, including activities. Make your reservation <br/>\nat the site below and send me your email so you can be part of <br/>\npre-weekend discussions. My role is to put out a date and location and <br/>\nto host a pre-weekend conversation. As the date gets closer I will keep <br/>\nin touch with those who reply they are joining us to discuss what we <br/>\nwant to do while together. This may (or may not) include shared meals or <br/>\nactivities, or whatever else will be of interest to those coming. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease reply to me at the email below when you make your reservations so <br/>\nI can add you to the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are welcome to come up for the day as well, just let me know when <br/>\nyou&#39;d like to join us so we can include you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention is for further planning conversations to not clutter the <br/>\nvarious lists I&#39;m announcing this on. I&#39;ll post additional announcements <br/>\nbetween now and the weekend on the lists, but please move pre-weekend <br/>\nconversations off-list among those attending. If you aren&#39;t sure you can <br/>\nattend but want to be part of that discussion, sent me an email and <br/>\nyou&#39;ll be included.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to see many of you there for the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the reservation site:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Sampson_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NY&parkId=232&topTabIndex=CampingSpot\">http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Sampson_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NY&parkId=232&topTabIndex=CampingSpot</a> <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Sampson_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NY&parkId=232&topTabIndex=CampingSpot\">http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Sampson_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NY&parkId=232&topTabIndex=CampingSpot</a>&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike Millow<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael@...\">michael@...</a> &lt;mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:michael@...\">michael@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n(585) 739-8205</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44613,"nextTopicId":43993}}
