I too loved school myself, so I became the eager-beaver type homeschooling my first child and wearing us both out!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years I learned to direct some of all that most earnest effort -- my drive toward research and resource procurement, plus that need to feel you are &quot;on the job&quot; doing important work as the primary homeschool parent and to show relatives you&#39;re focused on what is best for your daughter and willing to work hard for it -- toward cognitive psychology, education research and particularly the importance of better sleep in memory and learning, how disturbing it affects  personality and impulse/mood, sociability and confidence, self-esteem, etc etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone suggested moms follow their own interests instead of loading up the child&#39;s schedule with activities, good advice! One thing I did was getting a saxophone for myself while my six-year-old was taking piano lessons and having big fun with lessons for a few years, like John Holt taking up the cello as a middle-aged ex-education reformer. (Neither of us kept up either instrument but we don&#39;t regret all the fun and learning.) <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also, in the case of good-little-schoolgirl do-bee types like myself and perhaps the original poster, it can mean literally doing our own homework to learn new things about learning. Cognitive psychology is an exploding field since my first child was born in 1990, so my education degrees predated too much of what we know now. I&#39;ve been known to suggest to my own relatives and to new unschooling moms, that they assign such homework to people who won&#39;t get off their backs about being schoolish enough for the child. &lt;evil grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I wrote for Colleen in her first year of unschooling (are you here, Colleen? chime in!) expands on this idea of unschooling as adults teaching themselves instead of the child:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-lessons-for-school-minded-dads/\">http://cockingasnook.wordpress.com/unschooling-lessons-for-school-minded-dads/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jodi Bezzola &lt;jodibezzola@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~~The issue really is the time, we just absolutely HATE mornings, normally we&#39;re not up until 10:30, for the coop we have to be there at 8:30......, that&#39;s our issue, otherwise we both love it.~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Wow, we&#39;d be fighting here too if we had to be somewhere at 8:30 a.m., that&#39;s early!! :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there a rule that says you have to be on time to this co-op day?  Could you not stroll in a few hours later for the rest of the morning and the afternoon??  Just a thought.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Jodi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;       __________________________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Be smarter than spam.

I wanted her to have more friends and more opportunity for regular interactions. The coop is great for that and it is helping she does like it but she HATES that it&#39;s so early that one day a week---  there&#39;s no way around that... I&#39;ve tried having playdates regularly with a few other kids who she does talk to, but the parents are just too busy, either the kids are in school, or they have other kids and are just busy or whatever... I&#39;ve tried and tried and tried to get a regular playdate going but just the other moms can&#39;t do it for this reason or that reason, that&#39;s been frustrating. She loves the classes she takes there, she loves the outings and programs and get togethers they do, she really enjoys it, just that early morning is something neither of us like so that&#39;s really the only drawback. They only meet about half the year (24 Fridays) so it&#39;s not every single week and there&#39;s long times off inbetween....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe coop is big, but the class sizes are around 9-15, so it&#39;s not too terribly huge, there&#39;s a nursery for the baby which he LOVES and my daughter loves the crafts she gets to do each week, she&#39;s always excited, she LOVES show and tell, and this is helping her talk more, she loves the recess time and the assembly time and just all that and the crafts follow a theme per class so it sort of is like lax unit studies and it&#39;s way better than I could do on my own with a couple other kids.

If she was happy with it then I&#39;d say stick with it. But she seems to be communicating that this is too much. I tend to rotate activities with my kids. We will do a fairly relaxed coop for awhile, such and such class for awhile. But never schedule more than 1-2 formal activities per week.  And this is probably a lot less unschooly than typical. Also I second that selective mutism is a form of social anxiety. Forcing more social interaction may not be the best thing for her. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All that being said, she may be having issues with transitions as well.

Now, she&#39;s 6 and her priorities are constantly changing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it&#39;s hard to keep up. Yes, it seems flighty to start and stop things. We went through this for years with our DD. Compared to DS, who settled on a sport he loved very young, DD went from one activity to the next like changing clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for reading. She has always loved reading and now had to have an emergency trip to the library when public school didn&#39;t have enough books. Any, actually. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes, she decided to go to public school, starting with the 9th grade,<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention she is changeable? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nGo with it and enjoy all of it or at least let her enjoy what she wants to do and let go of the rest. It doesn&#39;t end and will be a long slog if every decision is a major one. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the future, DD is the one I don&#39;t worry about. She conquers whatever she decides to try. DS? I have no idea where he might land. He will be fine, I&#39;m sure, but I think he has some trial and error ahead of him. Who knows which is better. Try a lot of things young and see what clicks? Or stick with one or two things you love and see how that works out?

We can choose<br/>\nnot to pay taxes - we might end up in jail, we&#39;ll definitely end up<br/>\nowing more than otherwise in penalties and such, so we pay. We can<br/>\nchoose to do 90 mph on the highway - we might even get to our<br/>\ndestination safely without getting caught, but if we do get caught, it&#39;s<br/>\nserious (that&#39;s high enough to be considered reckless driving which is a<br/>\nmore serious penalty than just speeding), and there&#39;s a chance we can<br/>\nhurt ourselves or others, so we generally keep within range of the<br/>\nposted limits. We can choose not to work at all and live on government&#39;s<br/>\nprograms (food stamps, housing subsidies, etc) - and some people do<br/>\nthat. I can choose to eat whatever I want whenever I want, but that has<br/>\nhealth consequences (I&#39;m a type 2 diabetic) that I do not want to deal<br/>\nwith, so I keep an eye on what I eat and do the things I know are<br/>\nbeneficial - I don&#39;t always feel like spending an hour walking on the<br/>\ntreadmill but I know that the alternative is feeling less than good, so<br/>\nI choose to get my butt up and on the treadmill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

One is how packed in her schedule is. I&#39;d be stressed doing all of that and I&#39;m an adult. Now that may be my slightly introvert personality coming through but that just seems way too busy. If she was happy with it then I&#39;d say stick with it. But she seems to be communicating that this is too much. I tend to rotate activities with my kids. We will do a fairly relaxed coop for awhile, such and such class for awhile. But never schedule more than 1-2 formal activities per week.  And this is probably a lot less unschooly than typical. Also I second that selective mutism is a form of social anxiety. Forcing more social interaction may not be the best thing for her. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, she may be having issues with transitions as well. This may explain her reluctance in the moment for going somewhere planned. In which case I would work on smoothing over those transitions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso is it possible that when she says she doesn&#39;t want to quit ballet or piano she&#39;s picking up on your preferences and saying what she thinks you want to hear.

If she loves animals take her to the zoo, pet store, animal<br/>\nshelter, get a small animal that you are willing to care for, have books and<br/>\nvideos about animals all around. If she loves arts and crafts have them<br/>\navailable. Go to crafts at the library or craft store where there is no<br/>\nrequirements. Have informal craft meet ups with friends. Buy an inexpensive<br/>\nkeyboard instead of piano lessons, or have a variety of instruments around.<br/>\nFor sports, try rec centers that offer informal games with little to no<br/>\ncommitments. Or just play sports with her, even invite friends to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider being more flexible with her going to class or not. If she<br/>\nconsistently doesn&#39;t want to go I would take that as a sign that she isn&#39;t<br/>\ninterested right now. Find alternatives. Your life seems really busy and<br/>\nscheduled. perhaps she wants more free time.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I get that, I&#39;m all for following their lead and their wants and needs<br/>\nand dreams, but what about reality, not everyone will get their dream job or<br/>\neven want to do it everyday, I LOVE My job, but many days I don&#39;t want to be<br/>\nthere, but I can&#39;t just tell my clients- sorry, I&#39;m cancelling everyone<br/>\ntoday, that&#39;s just not life.. if she commits to a class then some of these<br/>\nclasses do meet once a week and she can&#39;t just show up once a month........<br/>\n<br/>\n***Everyone who wants to can have their dream job. Or at least will find a<br/>\njob they love enough to choose to make it work. You do have the freedom to<br/>\nquit at any point you want. You understand the consequences and choose not<br/>\nto skip work. You are likely over 25, she is 6. A 6 week commitment is a<br/>\nhuge amount of time for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is not able to commit then step back. She is a little child. Let her<br/>\nbe a little child.

So far what I can gather is that she loves<br/>\n&gt; art and nature/animals. I work 10 hrs a week and while I work she spends<br/>\n&gt; time with my grandmother or my mom- and we have a 10 month old too. I have a<br/>\n&gt; varied scheduled so none of our days are the same. Anyway, she takes ballet<br/>\n&gt; one or two times a week, which she really enjoys, some days she loves it,<br/>\n&gt; some days she could care less. I usually make her go to the class at least<br/>\n&gt; once a week, I want her to at least get through and do the recital and then<br/>\n&gt; see if she wants to continue. SHe loves dance so I think she will, I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; require any practice at home and she doesn&#39;t practice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Opening up a variety of options can be very helpful for some children.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I read the work &quot;make&quot; can that sounds like you force her. IS there options<br/>\n&gt; for her? Is there room for her to have other needs? You also write that<br/>\n&gt; *you* need her to get through the class and participate in a recital. Is<br/>\n&gt; that her need? Perhaps she just likes dancing but not all the time. Perhaps<br/>\n&gt; she has no desire to perform.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My oldest was in gymnastics. She loved it. Went each session, craved more.<br/>\n&gt; She really excelled. She made pre-team in about 6 months. In a short time<br/>\n&gt; they were telling her she would soon be able to be on the team. This is when<br/>\n&gt; she lost interest. She had no desire to compete. It wasn&#39;t her thing. She<br/>\n&gt; just loved gymnastics. So she stopped. She set gymnastics aside for a couple<br/>\n&gt; years. Lately she is asking for it again. She has been free to decide for<br/>\n&gt; herself how gymnastic fits into her life.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She also take piano, wanted to quit so we did for awhile, then I found a<br/>\n&gt; different teacher to try and we do it every other week or once a month for a<br/>\n&gt; 30 min lesson and I ask her to practice a couple times a week for 10<br/>\n&gt; minutes. I want her to give music a try and maybe after another few months<br/>\n&gt; move to another instrument and see and then we can decide on stopping.<br/>\n&gt; Basically left up to her she wants to do nothing, and that&#39;s fine but I want<br/>\n&gt; her to try things enough to really get a feel for them first before<br/>\n&gt; quitting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***How much is enough? Who decides when she has tried it enough, you or her?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I loved musical instruments when I was young. I played many. There were<br/>\n&gt; several instruments I never had any interest in and several others I picked<br/>\n&gt; up once or twice but they didn&#39;t resonate with me.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am reading a lot about your wants. What does your child want for her life?<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She takes a homeschool PE class once a week, she doesn&#39;t want to go but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only 1 hr a week, free, and I think it gives her good exposure to different<br/>\n&gt; sports in a group= plus she&#39;s now wanting to do tennis more from learning<br/>\n&gt; some at the class so this is something I make her go to most weeks...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***If she doesn&#39;t want to go I am not understand why you force her. what is<br/>\n&gt; your fear behind not giving her the choice?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there other more enjoy to her ways to expose her to more sports,<br/>\n&gt; activities? I am thinking wii fit, sports etc. Videos or TV shows about<br/>\n&gt; games and sports. Books or games relating to movement and sports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some children an adults are not team sports players. My ds loves soccer but<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t like to play on a team. He just doesn&#39;t enjoy that.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She goes to a club at our church once a week, it&#39;s like coed scouts, since<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t go to church (because I&#39;m not a morning person) this is great for<br/>\n&gt; her, she does like it, she enjoys the other kids there, they read stories,<br/>\n&gt; do crafts, learn songs, and sometimes go on an outing, etc...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Is it something she loves and chooses to do? If so great, let her keep<br/>\n&gt; going. Support that.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s also in girl scouts and seems to enjoy it. We&#39;re in a homeschool coop<br/>\n&gt; on Friday mornings, it&#39;s large and that&#39;s where she has her girlscout<br/>\n&gt; meeting. I do like the coop, she has regular kids she sees every week, fun<br/>\n&gt; classes, school programs, fieldtrips, parties and get togethers, yearbook<br/>\n&gt; even, I really enjoy it. On that Friday morning she takes 3 classes- one<br/>\n&gt; being girl scouts, then shhe takes a social studies type class there where<br/>\n&gt; they read stories and do crafts related to a different country each week,<br/>\n&gt; then they have a recess time, a little assembly time with bible stories and<br/>\n&gt; songs and then she takes a science class- they do a different experiment<br/>\n&gt; each week. Usually afterwards we go to a mom&#39;s house where she teaches art<br/>\n&gt; and has a playdate, which my daughter LOVES.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Again, you write that You enjoy co-op, does she? Does she want to<br/>\n&gt; participate in gilrscouts or social studies?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We learn everything in our lives without a structured school-like activity,<br/>\n&gt; We belonged to a co-op a while back. My kids loved it at first, there were<br/>\n&gt; other kids, I thought it was important that they were around other kids<br/>\n&gt; regularly. eventually we came to realize that they didn&#39;t like or get<br/>\n&gt; anything out of the classes. They were only continuing certain friendships<br/>\n&gt; out of obligation. They didn&#39;t really like the other kids and they hated the<br/>\n&gt; structure. It wasn&#39;t a good fit for us. We stopped going. We do different<br/>\n&gt; things now.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once a month we go to a garden club for an hour where she plants and does<br/>\n&gt; crafts, which she also loves! I also try to pick one day a month where we do<br/>\n&gt; something fun that she enjoys such as the zoo, the museum, the beach, St<br/>\n&gt; Augustine, roller skating, bowling, indoor play area, a park, etc.. Also<br/>\n&gt; once a month or every other month we try to go to a class they have at one<br/>\n&gt; of the nature centers, usually it&#39;s an hour or so and my daughter loves<br/>\n&gt; these. I also try to plan a couple fieldtrips every month, we do things like<br/>\n&gt; tour Whole Foods or the post office or a chocolate factory or an animal<br/>\n&gt; hospital, or we go to a play or even the circus, visit a farm, go on an<br/>\n&gt; overnight camping trip, or even go to Orlando and visit Sea World or another<br/>\n&gt; place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***That&#39;s great. It sounds like she is a social kid how thrives on outings.<br/>\n&gt; Instead of thinking fieldtrips it might be helpful to just think we are out<br/>\n&gt; living our lives, exploring, adventuring, etc.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So anyway, YES our schedule seems busy but it&#39;s really not bad, there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really no time for formal lessons, many days we&#39;re just home playing at<br/>\n&gt; least half of the day and playing outside some or taking a walk, then she<br/>\n&gt; may go to a class for an hour and then I go to work most evenings. It<br/>\n&gt; varies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t even really know what my question is, I guess I want to try<br/>\n&gt; and focus more on her particular interests, maybe a couple areas, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; take away others that she doesn&#39;t love like piano, etc... but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n&gt; RIght now she&#39;s young and I think it&#39;s good for her to be exposed to<br/>\n&gt; different things, and she seems to like everything except piano and PE, and<br/>\n&gt; getting up early some mornings:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Following her lead would mean letting go of the things that you want that<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t want.

What does your child want for her life?<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She takes a homeschool PE class once a week, she doesn&#39;t want to go but it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; only 1 hr a week, free, and I think it gives her good exposure to different<br/>\n&gt; sports in a group= plus she&#39;s now wanting to do tennis more from learning<br/>\n&gt; some at the class so this is something I make her go to most weeks...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***If she doesn&#39;t want to go I am not understand why you force her. what is<br/>\n&gt; your fear behind not giving her the choice?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Are there other more enjoy to her ways to expose her to more sports,<br/>\n&gt; activities? I am thinking wii fit, sports etc. Videos or TV shows about<br/>\n&gt; games and sports. Books or games relating to movement and sports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some children an adults are not team sports players. My ds loves soccer but<br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t like to play on a team. He just doesn&#39;t enjoy that.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She goes to a club at our church once a week, it&#39;s like coed scouts, since<br/>\n&gt; we don&#39;t go to church (because I&#39;m not a morning person) this is great for<br/>\n&gt; her, she does like it, she enjoys the other kids there, they read stories,<br/>\n&gt; do crafts, learn songs, and sometimes go on an outing, etc...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Is it something she loves and chooses to do? If so great, let her keep<br/>\n&gt; going. Support that.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She&#39;s also in girl scouts and seems to enjoy it. We&#39;re in a homeschool coop<br/>\n&gt; on Friday mornings, it&#39;s large and that&#39;s where she has her girlscout<br/>\n&gt; meeting. I do like the coop, she has regular kids she sees every week, fun<br/>\n&gt; classes, school programs, fieldtrips, parties and get togethers, yearbook<br/>\n&gt; even, I really enjoy it. On that Friday morning she takes 3 classes- one<br/>\n&gt; being girl scouts, then shhe takes a social studies type class there where<br/>\n&gt; they read stories and do crafts related to a different country each week,<br/>\n&gt; then they have a recess time, a little assembly time with bible stories and<br/>\n&gt; songs and then she takes a science class- they do a different experiment<br/>\n&gt; each week. Usually afterwards we go to a mom&#39;s house where she teaches art<br/>\n&gt; and has a playdate, which my daughter LOVES.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Again, you write that You enjoy co-op, does she? Does she want to<br/>\n&gt; participate in gilrscouts or social studies?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We learn everything in our lives without a structured school-like activity,<br/>\n&gt; We belonged to a co-op a while back. My kids loved it at first, there were<br/>\n&gt; other kids, I thought it was important that they were around other kids<br/>\n&gt; regularly. eventually we came to realize that they didn&#39;t like or get<br/>\n&gt; anything out of the classes. They were only continuing certain friendships<br/>\n&gt; out of obligation. They didn&#39;t really like the other kids and they hated the<br/>\n&gt; structure. It wasn&#39;t a good fit for us. We stopped going. We do different<br/>\n&gt; things now.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once a month we go to a garden club for an hour where she plants and does<br/>\n&gt; crafts, which she also loves! I also try to pick one day a month where we do<br/>\n&gt; something fun that she enjoys such as the zoo, the museum, the beach, St<br/>\n&gt; Augustine, roller skating, bowling, indoor play area, a park, etc.. Also<br/>\n&gt; once a month or every other month we try to go to a class they have at one<br/>\n&gt; of the nature centers, usually it&#39;s an hour or so and my daughter loves<br/>\n&gt; these. I also try to plan a couple fieldtrips every month, we do things like<br/>\n&gt; tour Whole Foods or the post office or a chocolate factory or an animal<br/>\n&gt; hospital, or we go to a play or even the circus, visit a farm, go on an<br/>\n&gt; overnight camping trip, or even go to Orlando and visit Sea World or another<br/>\n&gt; place.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***That&#39;s great. It sounds like she is a social kid how thrives on outings.<br/>\n&gt; Instead of thinking fieldtrips it might be helpful to just think we are out<br/>\n&gt; living our lives, exploring, adventuring, etc.<br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So anyway, YES our schedule seems busy but it&#39;s really not bad, there&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; really no time for formal lessons, many days we&#39;re just home playing at<br/>\n&gt; least half of the day and playing outside some or taking a walk, then she<br/>\n&gt; may go to a class for an hour and then I go to work most evenings. It<br/>\n&gt; varies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, I don&#39;t even really know what my question is, I guess I want to try<br/>\n&gt; and focus more on her particular interests, maybe a couple areas, and maybe<br/>\n&gt; take away others that she doesn&#39;t love like piano, etc... but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\n&gt; RIght now she&#39;s young and I think it&#39;s good for her to be exposed to<br/>\n&gt; different things, and she seems to like everything except piano and PE, and<br/>\n&gt; getting up early some mornings:)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ***Following her lead would mean letting go of the things that you want that<br/>\n&gt; she doesn&#39;t want.

We&#39;re pretty good at knowing what &quot;teaching&quot; looks like, but not how learning looks without teaching. Learning naturally looks like play! That can really throw you for a loop if you&#39;re looking for something that looks like &quot;education&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Basically what we do is this- I try to expose her to different areas to see what she is good at and likes.<br/>\n&gt; *********************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It wouldn&#39;t hurt to step back from the idea of &quot;exposing&quot; her to things - I&#39;m not saying its a horrible idea, but you don&#39;t *need* to do that for her to figure out what her likes and loves are. You can learn the same things by watching her play and seeing what she tends toward. Offer to do things with her because you think she&#39;d find them fun - that&#39;s really enough! <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Basically left up to her she wants to do nothing, and that&#39;s fine but I want her to try things enough to really get a feel for them first before quitting. <br/>\n&gt; ************************<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You&#39;re asking her to do something a six year old can&#39;t do - developmentally can&#39;t. For a six year old, liking or disliking something is a short-term thing. Its Natural for kids to have transient likes and dislikes at this age. Its not natural for them to &quot;learn to like&quot; things through repetition - by &quot;not natural&quot; I mean that&#39;s not how their brains work. The idea that kids learn that way is one of the big myths of child development. Kids develop longer term interests naturally as they get older and their brains mature. When parents have pushed long term interests and kids happen to like them, parents think &quot;see, you learned to like it&quot; - its a kind of fake-out of development, we (parents) think we&#39;re more important than we are, sometimes. Without pushing, being allowed to pick things up and put them down at will, kids naturally develop longer term interests and do it at roughly the same ages as kids who were pushed. Its not the pushing that does it, its development. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What that means is you Don&#39;t Have To make her take classes if she doesn&#39;t want to do it. In fact, its just as good to look for things she can try a few times and drop so that you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve &quot;wasted your money&quot; - look for classes where you can pay by the session or are cheap enough that you don&#39;t wince when she says &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot; You won&#39;t sell her short by doing that, you&#39;ll free up more time and energy for exploratory play. Since play is how kids learn, that&#39;s a Good thing. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;many days we&#39;re just home playing at least half of the day <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Given that kids learn mainly through play, half a day isn&#39;t very much at all. Its okay, even beneficial for her to have long whole days of &quot;just playing&quot;. She&#39;ll explore and discover as much that way as she will through lots of activities because that&#39;s how learning happens by nature. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If you&#39;re not used to thinking this way it may seem shocking - can kids really learn what they need to know &quot;just playing&quot;? They can and do. Its pretty amazing, actually, and humbling to realize just how little &quot;good&quot; teaching does in the face of natural learning abilities. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223327279,"authorName":"Faith Void","from":"Faith Void &lt;littlemsvoid@...&gt;","profile":"bloodyknucklesclub","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] 6 Yr Old","postDate":"1266180297","msgId":43152,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNjNjEyMGExMTAwMjE0MTI0NGw0MzRiZjc1OHA1NmJhYzlkZGMxNTE0MzE4QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsN2gxMituN2tzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsN2gxMituN2tzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43151,"nextInTopic":43153,"prevInTime":43151,"nextInTime":43153,"topicId":43149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok so Im kind of new to unschooling, I tried lessons (workbooks) and my daughter hates them and now I m back to just reading to her, I read her series books","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1341848417\">Ok so Im kind of new to unschooling, I tried lessons (workbooks) and my<br/>\ndaughter hates them and now I&#39;m back to just reading to her, I read her<br/>\nseries books like Magic Tree House- which she LOVES- and then we&#39;ll look at<br/>\nthe research guide if she&#39;s interested or we&#39;ll delve into one of the topics<br/>\nmore if it peeks her interest, and I read Little House books and stuff like<br/>\nthat... anyway, I&#39;m trying to follow her lead but I guess I&#39;m having trouble<br/>\nletting go of control and figuring out what to focus on...<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what we do is this- I try to expose her to different areas to see<br/>\nwhat she is good at and likes.

There were<br/>\nseveral instruments I never had any interest in and several others I picked<br/>\nup once or twice but they didn&#39;t resonate with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am reading a lot about your wants. What does your child want for her life?<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nShe takes a homeschool PE class once a week, she doesn&#39;t want to go but it&#39;s<br/>\nonly 1 hr a week, free, and I think it gives her good exposure to different<br/>\nsports in a group= plus she&#39;s now wanting to do tennis more from learning<br/>\nsome at the class so this is something I make her go to most weeks...<br/>\n<br/>\n***If she doesn&#39;t want to go I am not understand why you force her. what is<br/>\nyour fear behind not giving her the choice?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there other more enjoy to her ways to expose her to more sports,<br/>\nactivities? I am thinking wii fit, sports etc. Videos or TV shows about<br/>\ngames and sports. Books or games relating to movement and sports.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome children an adults are not team sports players. My ds loves soccer but<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t like to play on a team. He just doesn&#39;t enjoy that.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nShe goes to a club at our church once a week, it&#39;s like coed scouts, since<br/>\nwe don&#39;t go to church (because I&#39;m not a morning person) this is great for<br/>\nher, she does like it, she enjoys the other kids there, they read stories,<br/>\ndo crafts, learn songs, and sometimes go on an outing, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is it something she loves and chooses to do? If so great, let her keep<br/>\ngoing. Support that.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s also in girl scouts and seems to enjoy it. We&#39;re in a homeschool coop<br/>\non Friday mornings, it&#39;s large and that&#39;s where she has her girlscout<br/>\nmeeting. I do like the coop, she has regular kids she sees every week, fun<br/>\nclasses, school programs, fieldtrips, parties and get togethers, yearbook<br/>\neven, I really enjoy it. On that Friday morning she takes 3 classes- one<br/>\nbeing girl scouts, then shhe takes a social studies type class there where<br/>\nthey read stories and do crafts related to a different country each week,<br/>\nthen they have a recess time, a little assembly time with bible stories and<br/>\nsongs and then she takes a science class- they do a different experiment<br/>\neach week. Usually afterwards we go to a mom&#39;s house where she teaches art<br/>\nand has a playdate, which my daughter LOVES.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Again, you write that You enjoy co-op, does she? Does she want to<br/>\nparticipate in gilrscouts or social studies?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe learn everything in our lives without a structured school-like activity,<br/>\nWe belonged to a co-op a while back. My kids loved it at first, there were<br/>\nother kids, I thought it was important that they were around other kids<br/>\nregularly. eventually we came to realize that they didn&#39;t like or get<br/>\nanything out of the classes. They were only continuing certain friendships<br/>\nout of obligation. They didn&#39;t really like the other kids and they hated the<br/>\nstructure. It wasn&#39;t a good fit for us. We stopped going. We do different<br/>\nthings now.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a month we go to a garden club for an hour where she plants and does<br/>\ncrafts, which she also loves! I also try to pick one day a month where we do<br/>\nsomething fun that she enjoys such as the zoo, the museum, the beach, St<br/>\nAugustine, roller skating, bowling, indoor play area, a park, etc.. Also<br/>\nonce a month or every other month we try to go to a class they have at one<br/>\nof the nature centers, usually it&#39;s an hour or so and my daughter loves<br/>\nthese. I also try to plan a couple fieldtrips every month, we do things like<br/>\ntour Whole Foods or the post office or a chocolate factory or an animal<br/>\nhospital, or we go to a play or even the circus, visit a farm, go on an<br/>\novernight camping trip, or even go to Orlando and visit Sea World or another<br/>\nplace.<br/>\n<br/>\n***That&#39;s great. It sounds like she is a social kid how thrives on outings.<br/>\nInstead of thinking fieldtrips it might be helpful to just think we are out<br/>\nliving our lives, exploring, adventuring, etc.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, YES our schedule seems busy but it&#39;s really not bad, there&#39;s<br/>\nreally no time for formal lessons, many days we&#39;re just home playing at<br/>\nleast half of the day and playing outside some or taking a walk, then she<br/>\nmay go to a class for an hour and then I go to work most evenings. It<br/>\nvaries.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I don&#39;t even really know what my question is, I guess I want to try<br/>\nand focus more on her particular interests, maybe a couple areas, and maybe<br/>\ntake away others that she doesn&#39;t love like piano, etc... but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>\nRIght now she&#39;s young and I think it&#39;s good for her to be exposed to<br/>\ndifferent things, and she seems to like everything except piano and PE, and<br/>\ngetting up early some mornings:)<br/>\n<br/>\n***Following her lead would mean letting go of the things that you want that<br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t want. It might mean playing more and structure less. Childhood<br/>\nis about play. Play is learning. I learn by playing, though my play may look<br/>\ndifferent than a small child&#39;s. We are a family of adventurers, explorers<br/>\nand cavorting spirits. We play and laugh and learn and live. By allowing my<br/>\nchildren the space to be who they are they find their path. Not mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nFaith<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/\">http://faithvoid.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\nwww.bearthmama.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: 6 Yr Old","postDate":"1266173601","msgId":43151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsOWdyMStqOGhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsN2gxMituN2tzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43149,"nextInTopic":43152,"prevInTime":43150,"nextInTime":43152,"topicId":43149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** If you need to focus find interests of your own - that could include studying learning if you like, that was something *I* found","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-26209798\">--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;kristi3003@...&quot; &lt;kristi3003@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m trying to follow her lead but I guess I&#39;m having trouble letting go of control and figuring out what to focus on... <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need to &quot;focus&quot; find interests of your own - that could include studying learning if you like, that was something *I* found helpful when I was first wrapping my mind around unschooling and natural learning. We&#39;re pretty good at knowing what &quot;teaching&quot; looks like, but not how learning looks without teaching. Learning naturally looks like play! That can really throw you for a loop if you&#39;re looking for something that looks like &quot;education&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Basically what we do is this- I try to expose her to different areas to see what she is good at and likes.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldn&#39;t hurt to step back from the idea of &quot;exposing&quot; her to things - I&#39;m not saying its a horrible idea, but you don&#39;t *need* to do that for her to figure out what her likes and loves are. You can learn the same things by watching her play and seeing what she tends toward. Offer to do things with her because you think she&#39;d find them fun - that&#39;s really enough! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Basically left up to her she wants to do nothing, and that&#39;s fine but I want her to try things enough to really get a feel for them first before quitting. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>************************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re asking her to do something a six year old can&#39;t do - developmentally can&#39;t. For a six year old, liking or disliking something is a short-term thing. Its Natural for kids to have transient likes and dislikes at this age. Its not natural for them to &quot;learn to like&quot; things through repetition - by &quot;not natural&quot; I mean that&#39;s not how their brains work. The idea that kids learn that way is one of the big myths of child development. Kids develop longer term interests naturally as they get older and their brains mature. When parents have pushed long term interests and kids happen to like them, parents think &quot;see, you learned to like it&quot; - its a kind of fake-out of development, we (parents) think we&#39;re more important than we are, sometimes. Without pushing, being allowed to pick things up and put them down at will, kids naturally develop longer term interests and do it at roughly the same ages as kids who were pushed. Its not the pushing that does it, its development. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat that means is you Don&#39;t Have To make her take classes if she doesn&#39;t want to do it. In fact, its just as good to look for things she can try a few times and drop so that you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve &quot;wasted your money&quot; - look for classes where you can pay by the session or are cheap enough that you don&#39;t wince when she says &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it.&quot; You won&#39;t sell her short by doing that, you&#39;ll free up more time and energy for exploratory play. Since play is how kids learn, that&#39;s a Good thing. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;many days we&#39;re just home playing at least half of the day <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Given that kids learn mainly through play, half a day isn&#39;t very much at all. Its okay, even beneficial for her to have long whole days of &quot;just playing&quot;. She&#39;ll explore and discover as much that way as she will through lots of activities because that&#39;s how learning happens by nature. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re not used to thinking this way it may seem shocking - can kids really learn what they need to know &quot;just playing&quot;? They can and do. Its pretty amazing, actually, and humbling to realize just how little &quot;good&quot; teaching does in the face of natural learning abilities. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 8, Ray 16)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333475996,"authorName":"kristi3003@bellsouth.net","from":"&quot;kristi3003@...&quot; &lt;kristi3003@...&gt;","profile":"kristi3003@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"6 Yr Old","postDate":"1266108258","msgId":43149,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsN2gxMituN2tzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43151,"prevInTime":43148,"nextInTime":43150,"topicId":43149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ok so Im kind of new to unschooling, I tried lessons (workbooks) and my daughter hates them and now I m back to just reading to her, I read her series books","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-902137646\">Ok so Im kind of new to unschooling, I tried lessons (workbooks) and my daughter hates them and now I&#39;m back to just reading to her, I read her series books like Magic Tree House- which she LOVES- and then we&#39;ll look at the research guide if she&#39;s interested or we&#39;ll delve into one of the topics more if it peeks her interest, and I read Little House books and stuff like that... anyway, I&#39;m trying to follow her lead but I guess I&#39;m having trouble letting go of control and figuring out what to focus on... <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what we do is this- I try to expose her to different areas to see what she is good at and likes. So far what I can gather is that she loves art and nature/animals. I work 10 hrs a week and while I work she spends time with my grandmother or my mom- and we have a 10 month old too. I have a varied scheduled so none of our days are the same. Anyway, she takes ballet one or two times a week, which she really enjoys, some days she loves it, some days she could care less. I usually make her go to the class at least once a week, I want her to at least get through and do the recital and then see if she wants to continue. SHe loves dance so I think she will, I don&#39;t require any practice at home and she doesn&#39;t practice. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also take piano, wanted to quit so we did for awhile, then I found a different teacher to try and we do it every other week or once a month for a 30 min lesson and I ask her to practice a couple times a week for 10 minutes. I want her to give music a try and maybe after another few months move to another instrument and see and then we can decide on stopping.
