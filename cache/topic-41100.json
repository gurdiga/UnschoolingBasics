I fully agree that <br/>\nunschooling may look unremarkable to others at times. There are a couple <br/>\npoints though that I would like to make:<br/>\n<br/>\nOften - but not always - the kids become remarkable to the outside world <br/>\njust because unschooling works SO well. People are often telling me how <br/>\nunusual and talented my son is. He is just a regular kid and he and I <br/>\nknow that very well- but unschooling has allowed him to become more <br/>\nfully involved in the things he loves - and that is remarkable. This is <br/>\nnot just with his musical talent - but in other situations, in small <br/>\nways. Like including a younger child, or just showing up to a job <br/>\neveryday and doing more than what is asked for! A lot of it is that many <br/>\npeople are not used to seeing teens who are choosing to be where they <br/>\nare, so that surprises them. He actually doesn&#39;t always like this. It is <br/>\nconfusing to have other people&#39;s approval - as he just does it because <br/>\nhe loves it or it feels like the right thing. He is good at playing bass <br/>\nbecause he has spent so much time doing that for his own amusement.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is is that life itself can become remarkable when you are <br/>\nradically unschooling. More exciting and passionate in general. It seems <br/>\npretty normal around here for someone to get excited about and wrapped <br/>\nup in something - not just kids -whether that is something anyone else <br/>\ncan appreciate or not, I personally find the excitement itself contagious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meredith:The point about passions isn&#39;t really that we need to somehow <br/>\n&gt; engender them in our kids, but that kids have the same capacity for <br/>\n&gt; intense interests and passions as adults. That&#39;s not a particulary <br/>\n&gt; common message - children are not seen as passionate people for the <br/>\n&gt; most part, and parents usually seek to discourage &quot;obsessions&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes they can, and can also be as skillful as adults in some cases. And <br/>\ncan earn money doing it if they want - though that is not the goal, at <br/>\nleast for me.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Meredith: Kids do get stuck in ruts sometimes. And kids don&#39;t always <br/>\n&gt; know what they want to do, either in the moment or (with older kids) <br/>\n&gt; in a larger sense. So it can be really helpful to provide options - <br/>\n&gt; strew ideas and experiences and new things across their paths and see <br/>\n&gt; what they pick up. Ideally, there&#39;s not some kind of goal that the <br/>\n&gt; child will hit upon some grand passion in this way, its more a way to <br/>\n&gt; liven things up, keep life interesting.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have found this to be really important. My kids to a certain point <br/>\nwere interested in the simple things in life- but because of who they <br/>\nare or  what they see around them, they seemed to want something more. <br/>\nThey asked - either directly or by general discontent, or interest in <br/>\nthings they DID see - like school. Their cousins have always gone to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is very passionate about many things- he is the one who pushes me <br/>\nto follow through on stuff - and at this point opportunites just fall in <br/>\nhis lap. His list of 20 things he wanted to learn about was not <br/>\nrequested by me- it was all his. He keeps reminding me if I forget to <br/>\nfollow up on something- and does a lot of that himself now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, is much different- but maybe she looks at him and wants <br/>\nsomething like that for herself- basically something fun to do, with <br/>\npeople, preferably. She is pretty content when she can spend lots and <br/>\nlots of time with her cousins or friends- which is not possible daily. <br/>\nShe is needing something to keep her life more interesting.  I actually <br/>\nfeel like I am not offering enough, as I get busy with other stuff and <br/>\nforget.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlanning things to do with other people on a regular basis has been <br/>\nreally really important for us. I started out unschooling thinking along <br/>\nthe lines of the continuum concept- oh- the kids will just be happy <br/>\njoining in with things that I do - and it will be simple and without <br/>\neffort. This worked when they were very young only. If I want my kids to <br/>\nbe happy and content at home, I find I actually need to put quite a bit <br/>\nof effort into seeking out things and people outside the home to get <br/>\ninvolved in. Other kids probably are different- or maybe their parents <br/>\nlives are just naturally more interesting!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeather (in NY)<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210259120,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;meredith@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: interests/passions/learning from life","postDate":"1250639793","msgId":41105,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg2ZmYzaCs0dTR0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI4NTM0My4xNjE2Mi5xbUB3ZWI2NTcxMC5tYWlsLmFjNC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":41100,"nextInTopic":41107,"prevInTime":41104,"nextInTime":41106,"topicId":41100,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** Yes indeed!
