Really.   How could a person&#39;s <br/>\ninterests never grow?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a mom wonders if her eight year old will ever have an interest beyond <br/>\nwhat he&#39;s doing today, she can think about what interested that kid at <br/>\nthree.  Think about what he played with and enjoyed and how some or all of <br/>\nthat has changed over the years.    Is that eight year old doing things <br/>\nexactly the same<br/>\nway he did them when he was two, or five?  Is he interested in all the same <br/>\nthings?   When a mom can look back over a child&#39;s life and see how much he&#39;s <br/>\nchanged and grown and discovered, there should be some logical connection <br/>\nthere, in her own mind, that as things have changed, things will change.<br/>\n<br/>\n***What if they don&#39;t ever get interested<br/>\nin anything other than computer and X Box?***<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people will love video games their whole life long.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>\nwrong with that.  I love gardening, I suspect I always will.  Even the most <br/>\navid pursuit of a passion doesn&#39;t exclude everything else.  People have to <br/>\neat - and kids will probably be interested in pizza or fondue or popcorn. <br/>\nPeople wear clothes - and kids will probably be interested in getting shirts <br/>\nand shoes and pants that fit.  People like to know what&#39;s going on, and kids <br/>\nwill be interested in talking with interesting adults.   So, even when an <br/>\ninterest seems all consuming, I think if a worried mom really looks at what <br/>\nher kids are doing, she will see them interested in more than video games.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I really want to be an unschooler and I want to trust in myself and my <br/>\nkids.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you want to be an unschooler?   I really think it would help you, if <br/>\nyou have time, to write it out (to the list or just for yourself).  Really <br/>\nconsider all the reasons you think unschooling is the way you want to go and <br/>\nwhy.   If you can clarify your own thoughts, then some of your worries will <br/>\ndisappear and we can help you with the ones that linger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to be an unschooler because school at home is stressful and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be working, we can give you links to writings about how much <br/>\ntime and commitment unschooling takes.  It&#39;s a different kind of commitment <br/>\nthan sitting down at ten in the morning with a workbook, but it&#39;s a real <br/>\ncommitment.<br/>\nIf you&#39;re burned out or stressed out and want a vacation and unschooling <br/>\nlooks like that vacation to you, then I don&#39;t think you understand what a <br/>\nreal investment of your time and energy unschooling will be.   If you need a <br/>\nbreak, take one! &lt;g&gt;  Take a year off school and live with your kids like <br/>\nyou&#39;re on the longest and best vacation of your life, and in that time, read <br/>\nabout unschooling.  Write about your thoughts and what you&#39;re doing.  You <br/>\nmight find life with your kids - without school - answers most of your <br/>\nquestions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n***I am struggling myself as I feel guilty because I think that I am taking <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&quot;lazy&quot; way out.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s an important question and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re wondering.&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone wrote to the list owners and moderators that she did not believe <br/>\nunschoolers needed to provide a big and interesting world for their kids. <br/>\nI am sometimes afraid that people who are just so burned out by the stress <br/>\nof schooling and parenting and other of life&#39;s challenges, come to <br/>\nunschooling because they believe they won&#39;t have to do as much.   I suspect <br/>\nthere are people who read some of the really beautifully written and well <br/>\nthought out articles about all the learning that can come from TV and video <br/>\ngames and miss the whole point.  They read that TV is ok and they settle <br/>\ninto a life where their kids have all the TV they want but few other happy, <br/>\ninteresting choices.   Unschooling is not neglect.  Stress is not an excuse <br/>\nfor neglecting to provide an interesting life for our kids.   If a parent <br/>\ncan&#39;t, or doesn&#39;t want to, or doesn&#39;t believe doing things with her kids is <br/>\nas important as providing food and shelter, she&#39;s not unschooling.  There <br/>\nwill probably always be times when money or circumstance keeps a family home <br/>\nmore, but home should still be a wonderful place with more to offer than <br/>\njust TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat you are wondering about your own motives seems thoughtful and <br/>\nresponsible.<br/>\nWhat kinds of things will you be able to do with your kids at home?  What <br/>\nkinds of places can you go to?  What do your kids love to do, and are you <br/>\nable and willing to help them do those things?

As my <br/>\ndd&#39;s attendance did not improve, the school began to make an example <br/>\nof me, and I was ticketed for &#39;contributing to the truancy of a <br/>\nminor&#39;. She was academically proficient in all areas, and <br/>\nparticipated in girl scouts, and music lessons. I was the PTA <br/>\nsecretary, and volunteered whenever possible. Even though my <br/>\ndaughter was obviously doing well in school and not &#39;truant&#39;, by <br/>\nstate standards was defined as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was quuestioned by every and anybody from the <br/>\nteacher/pricipal/social worker/ police officer to the district <br/>\nattorney. This process took over the summer and into Novemeber of <br/>\nlast year. I had changed to public homeschooling, where her <br/>\nattandance was perfect, and her progress on target. The art <br/>\ntherapist was not only against homeschooling, but also traveling <br/>\nwith my daughter, and actaully said she thought the entire <br/>\nhomeschooling process was for my convenience. I faced opposition <br/>\nfrom many unexpected sources, but after due consideration, have <br/>\nstuck to my guns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results so far have been a disappearance of all <br/>\ndepression/anxiety symptoms, and the return of my daughter&#39;s usual <br/>\nbubbly self. She has a zest for life and new experinces. <br/>\nHomeschooling didn&#39;t work out quite as I&#39;d hoped, and I love the <br/>\nfreedom of every day adventures becoming part of her education. By <br/>\nthe way, we eventually found the cause of her headaches-poor vision. <br/>\nAlthough she had been checked annually, her vision decreased from <br/>\n20/30 to 20/80 in a very short period of time. She also has <br/>\ncontracted only 1 virus/cold  since leaving school, as compared with <br/>\nevrey 2-3 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur experience has reinforced the advice I&#39;ve alwyas given to others:<br/>\nExperts don&#39;t know your child better than you.

Currently we go to their offices but face having lots of them in our home beginning in March after my 11 yr old&#39;s scoliosis surgery.   All of her therapy at that point will be moved home.   I have thought about questions like this myself and remember when this child was little and we did have home therapy and i was homeschooling the older ones using a more traditional homeschooling method. I remember  feeling a bit like I was being &quot;watched&quot; (mostly my perception as I was new to homeschooling and a teacher by education and felt very out of the norm!)    <br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate recently Ainsley&#39;s speech therapist asked her how homeschooling was going (the therapist has just begun this year to homeschool her son mostly because of what she sees in Ainsley as her child has developmental issues that were not being served in his school placement)   Ainsley&#39;s response was &quot;Oh we don&#39;t do that homeschooling thing anymore... &quot;    this puzzled the therapist so she asked further questions and Ainsley&#39;s response was &quot;Oh yeah we are still at home but we don&#39;t homeschool we just play, watch tv, do science experiments, build stuff, go places and things like that&quot;     The therapist was impressed that Ainsley is learning so much all the time yet &quot;feels&quot; like she isn&#39;t having &quot;school&quot;  !!   I think I won one for unschooling! HA!      <br/>\n<br/>\n I am a bit nervous about having these new people in my home but I have learned over the  years if a therapist isn&#39;t on the same page I fire them.   I won&#39;t have homeschool unfriendly people and I won&#39;t have people who are not child sensitive.   I usually sit down before I hire a therapist and have a conversation with them about homeschooling and my background and what I believe and what I need them to understand about our family ... if they aren&#39;t on the same page I don&#39;t begin therapy with them.     <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you are in the position of having a therapist involved with your kids they do become part of the family we have had our current PT and OT for 5 years.... our speech therapist for 3 yrs... you do get very involved with each other.   They become allies in the process of helping your child so it&#39;s hard to change major things in your life and worry about their disapproval.   For me it&#39;s not so much that I should &quot;care&quot; what they think but because of the relationship and my valuing their opinions (not above my own but still knowing their desire is for the best for my child as well)  but I respect their opinions and wouldn&#39;t have them involved with my children if I didn&#39;t.    I suppose it&#39;s complicated because alot of this is somewhat against the way I feel about what other people think about my unschooling and parenting, I do count the therapists as friends so to me I appreciate that they have opinions about  my children&#39;s well being.   I haven&#39;t had any of them ever<br/>\n question what I do but I credit that with the work and openness I had in the beginning of the relationship.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSoooooo my suggestion would be to talk to the therapist and tell her that you feel your current method isn&#39;t being successful and you are going to try some less structured methods that may not appear to be &quot;school&quot; to the uninitiated .    I can&#39;t imagine any therapist not noticing your kids growing and learning and becoming their own little people.   If she doesn&#39;t she may not be the therapist for you!

As far as needing the therapist, I have a son with Asperger&#39;s (age 10) and my daughter has anxiety and selective mutism (which is that she only talks to immediate family and absolutely no one else, she&#39;s 9).  I have one other daughter who has a mood disorder and anxiety.  She is in public school and will be coming home next year (age 12).  All take medication for their particular symptoms and in order to get the medicine, the therapist is required.  According to the treatment plan they have to be seen weekly.  I live in Indiana and our homeschooling laws are very lenient.  I only have to provide proof of 180 days of instruction if asked.  I tried to explain unschooling to the therapist and she does not understand.  I had already opened my mouth before I posted this to the list for suggestions and now it is &quot;out there&quot;.  I asked her to do some research online about unschooling before passing judgment.  I had originally explained their schooling as more of an eclectic style because I was going to keep making them do math and grammar lessons.  After I explored unschooling some more I decided that I didn&#39;t want to go that route.  It wasn&#39;t working for us and I don&#39;t see that that method of schooling is productive.  I am struggling myself as I feel guilty because I think that I am taking the &quot;lazy&quot; way out. I am working very hard on getting it through my thick head that this is a good method of homeschooling.  I am so worried that they aren&#39;t going to learn anything on their own.  They don&#39;t seem to be interested in anything in particular.  All of the articles and books that I&#39;ve read have kids who are always immersed in one topic or another.  What if they don&#39;t ever get interested in anything other than computer and X Box?  I am so confused.  I really want to be an unschooler and I want to trust in myself and my kids.  I am really grateful for a group like this that is there to give me such good advice.

I&#39;m not sure of ages or why you <br/>\nhave a therapist, but I have seven children, two of whom have life difficulties due to <br/>\nautism.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had various therapists in our lives (and our homes) due to our two oldest <br/>\nchildren&#39;s issues, but we have never put up with one telling us how to run our lives. <br/>\nPrimarily they do not have the right, and secondarily, they will only be that intrusive if you <br/>\nallow it. Remember that you are the consumer, and they are a paid service. I definitely <br/>\nwould not try to explain unschooling to her, much less try to justify my children&#39;s <br/>\nactivities. If she asks again, I would say &quot;I think it&#39;s more appropriate that we discuss what <br/>\nyou came here for, here are the problems we&#39;re having this week. This is how we&#39;re <br/>\nhandling it.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way to protect yourself is to be aware of the laws in your state. Become educated <br/>\nand firm in your standing. If someone threatens you, be able to state, &#39;According to statute <br/>\nxyz, I have the right to educate my children in a manner that I see fit.&#39; Have the wording <br/>\nfrom DCF that says that parents are only to be reported for x kind of neglect, and that <br/>\nthere is no proof of this. DCF will cause a temporary annoyance (if they even follow up on <br/>\nthis) and the therapist will get bad reviews from one side of your town to another. If she <br/>\nknows you are not worried, then she&#39;ll think twice. Oh, i guess you could be nice and say <br/>\n&quot;Thank you for your concern, but the law states that blahblahblah&quot; And you can always use <br/>\nthe &#39;pass the bean dip&#39; phrase. Basically finish the discussion instead of letting a debate <br/>\nstart, by changing the topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nanyway, you&#39;ll get lots of input from here, really great ones too. We did cut out a lot of <br/>\ntherapy, in light of unschooling it seemed ridiculous ;-) Our children have thrived without <br/>\nit, and keeping positive people around you will make a big difference to your energy and <br/>\nto your motivation.

If<br/>\nit is, then you might want to say you&#39;re going to be doing things a<br/>\nbit differently and you won&#39;t have worksheets and kill & drill pages<br/>\nto show her, but that if she works with the children long enough<br/>\nshe&#39;ll be able to see progress for herself. IMO, reviewing tests and<br/>\nworksheets as a way of evaluating kids is *very* lazy.
