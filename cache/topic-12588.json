Your family doesn&#39;t have to accept unschooling.  I<br/>\nfigured out quite some time ago that my family doesn&#39;t accept at least half<br/>\nthe decisions I have made in my life and they don&#39;t have to.  I&#39;m not going<br/>\nto sit in another closet in fear because their acceptance doesn&#39;t truly have<br/>\nan effect on me.  They can disapprove all they want, but it doesn&#39;t do them,<br/>\nme nor my children any good.  You are doing nothing illegal.  Your children<br/>\nare not in harm, being neglected, nor abused.  I think the first thing you<br/>\nhave to do is establish yourself as your chldren&#39;s parent.  When you feel<br/>\nlike you have to have other people&#39;s approval to do things for and with your<br/>\nchildren, you are not the authoritative parent.  You are living by someone<br/>\nelse&#39;s rules.  They are parenting your children.  Hiding what you do from<br/>\nyour family isn&#39;t healthy for you nor your children.  And what kind of<br/>\nlesson is that for your children?  It&#39;s telling them that you are doing<br/>\nsomething wrong and you aren&#39;t!  Unschooling is freeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t talk about unschooling to my extended family, but then I try not to<br/>\ntalk to my extended family about anything :)  My grandmother and aunt and<br/>\nuncles just would not get it and think I am loonier than they already think<br/>\nI am.  (I mean I had 3 kids and breastfed them until they were all like, I<br/>\ndon&#39;t know 18 or something and she &quot;lets&quot; her husband (who they dont&#39; know I<br/>\ndivorced because we are still living together) wear his hair down to his<br/>\nbutt and they don&#39;t go to church - pagan here as well.)  My mother knows we<br/>\nunschool and she doesn&#39;t approve, but (shrug)  she doesn&#39;t approve of most<br/>\nof my life either, but I&#39;m not harming my children and maybe one of these<br/>\ndays I will wake up and realize the horrible disservice I have done to my<br/>\nchildren by home/unschooling them and get them back into all these wonderful<br/>\nenrichment programs that she keeps sending me information about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some help in dispelling the fear-demon - and quick!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThen tell the fear-demon to go away.
