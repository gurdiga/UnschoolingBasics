We rarely use apple slices unless they&#39;re going to be the first<br/>\nthing eaten precisely because of that issue. Maybe spend a couple hours<br/>\non a weekend and make some pocket pies (check out Alton Brown&#39;s recipe<br/>\non the food network website - it&#39;s easy and tasty and the baked in<br/>\ncinnamon apples don&#39;t have quite the same issue as the fresh).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, also, one of those apple wedgers might be good - they make plastic<br/>\nones that don&#39;t cut skin readily but they core and slice apples in a<br/>\nflash - maybe just have that handy and the fresh apples so the kids can<br/>\nget a sliced apple at will without letting it sit out.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

We keep grapes, <br/>\nbananas, nuts, pretzels, and Kashi bars on the counter within the <br/>\nboys&#39; reach. We also have apple sauce, yogurt, and cheese within <br/>\ntheir reach on the fridge door. The boys know where to find cereal, <br/>\ncrackers, raisins, and marshmallows in a lower cabinet. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout 2-3 hours after breakfast and lunch, we put out a plastic tray <br/>\nof veggies: grape tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, and green peppers. <br/>\nAfter 30 minutes or so, when grazing has stopped, I put the lid on <br/>\nand refrigerate the remainders. (We bought one veggie tray from the <br/>\ngrocery and then replenish it ourselves with the boys&#39; favorite <br/>\nveggies. The tray has lasted a long time.) <br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned browning of apple slices causing distress. One solution <br/>\nis to sprinkle a bit of lemon juice on a plate and then coat each cut <br/>\nside of the apple with the lemon juice. This delays browning. (Or, <br/>\nyou can shake the apple pieces in a bag containing lemon juice if <br/>\nthat is easier.)<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!
