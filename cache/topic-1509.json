That&#39;s a trick I used <br/>\n&gt; when<br/>\n&gt; Dylan was little.   In a quiet moment I would review the situation and<br/>\n&gt; sort of talk it out in my head and deliberately use really gentle,<br/>\n&gt; careful, loving words about him and I would be so much calmer and more<br/>\n&gt; patient and loving with him the next minute.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; First I think you&#39;re absolutely right that he was tired and feeling the<br/>\n&gt; effects of an upset routine and maybe even a mom who was, because of a<br/>\n&gt; big, busy weekend, pushed a little past her comfortable place, too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But instead of calling the toy he hit his sister with a weapon - which<br/>\n&gt; immediately makes the user of the &quot;weapon&quot; seem like a deliberate<br/>\n&gt; criminal you could have called it just what it was, a truck or a dog <br/>\n&gt; or a<br/>\n&gt; duck.

Maybe those words were used about us<br/>\n&gt; when we were little.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I agree with you that you can help him when he&#39;s tired and worn out but<br/>\n&gt; maybe you can think about ways he wants you to help him instead of ways<br/>\n&gt; you think he needs to be helped?   Surely he was tired, but maybe just<br/>\n&gt; snuggling with you or being rocked or having you hold him and sing or<br/>\n&gt; some other favorite, restful, calming thing could have helped him, too.<br/>\n&gt;  He wasn&#39;t refusing to go to sleep in order to make you mad.  He was <br/>\n&gt; more<br/>\n&gt; likely past the point where sleep would come easily.

You will probably remember and be<br/>\n&gt; horrified by that swat longer than he will.   But here&#39;s a chance to <br/>\n&gt; put<br/>\n&gt; things into perspective.

Did someone<br/>\n&gt; say that about you or to you - that they weren&#39;t going to let you &quot;run<br/>\n&gt; all over them?&quot;  That&#39;s so sad.<br/>\n&gt; You are partners with your kids and they want the same happy family you<br/>\n&gt; want.  If you think badly of them, if you think they want to mistreat <br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; it will be harder for you to find loving solutions to the ordinary<br/>\n&gt; frustrations of family life.

A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-819839672\">Dear, Dear, Joan - <br/>\nThanks so much.  Your inspiration was what I was missing yesterday.  There is NO WAY I would have thought to make up a frieking story!!  A story and a back rub would have gone a long way for him.  As I said before, he is a very gentle child and was probably mean to Kobe because he was out of his mind with fatigue.  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t really mean to control him but I did feel like he was trying to rebel so I guess so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate your opinion.  Going out would have been great too - but it was raining during this whole episode.  I wonder if I would have thought about that if it were sunny outside.  I really did cross a line yesterday.  I hope he&#39;s not scarred - I sure am.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\nGeneva  .<br/>\n<br/>\nMy specific suggestions to your situation would be as follows (and FYI my dd<br/>\nis 5.8 and my ds is 3.5):  Sounds like your son was having trouble &quot;winding<br/>\ndown&quot; which happens a lot to my kids too when they are over-tired.  You<br/>\ncould think about ways of helping him do that in addition to or instead of<br/>\njust lying down with him.  Backrubs work wonders to relax my daughter.  You<br/>\ncould read a story.  You could make up a story (my kids love those more than<br/>\nbooks anyway - holds their attention).  Maybe your story could be about a<br/>\nlittle train (or dump truck, or whatever your boy loves) who was going and<br/>\ngoing for so long that when he finally lay down to sleep he just couldn&#39;t<br/>\nlie still...and so on.  A soft tone of voice and lots of repetition may send<br/>\nhim off to dreamland.

I also don&#39;t want to yell, scream, scare or just let them<br/>\nhave his way because it&#39;s easiest...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, Geneva and welcome,<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a very difficult situation for you and Echo yesterday - if you<br/>\nwere up at 5am too, then you must have been quite tired also.  I know for<br/>\nme, tired mama plus tired kid or kids is a huge challenge.  Good for you for<br/>\nnot deciding that the swatting worked and for trying to find another way you<br/>\ncan go when you are feeling that frustrated.  I have a few thoughts for you<br/>\nto consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is that rather than &quot;acting like a bad kid yesterday&quot; as you quoted your<br/>\nson saying above, a different way of looking at it is that he was simply<br/>\nsending messages and trying to get his needs met.  The behavior you termed<br/>\nas &quot;defiant&quot; when telling your son to lie down, I would interpret in my<br/>\nchildren as them sending me a message about their need for autonomy.<br/>\nChildren do have the same need as adults to choose I believe.  It is a human<br/>\nneed not to be controlled.  That doesn&#39;t mean that your needs as mom don&#39;t<br/>\nmatter or that you can&#39;t work it out together.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy specific suggestions to your situation would be as follows (and FYI my dd<br/>\nis 5.8 and my ds is 3.5):  Sounds like your son was having trouble &quot;winding<br/>\ndown&quot; which happens a lot to my kids too when they are over-tired.  You<br/>\ncould think about ways of helping him do that in addition to or instead of<br/>\njust lying down with him.  Backrubs work wonders to relax my daughter.  You<br/>\ncould read a story.  You could make up a story (my kids love those more than<br/>\nbooks anyway - holds their attention).  Maybe your story could be about a<br/>\nlittle train (or dump truck, or whatever your boy loves) who was going and<br/>\ngoing for so long that when he finally lay down to sleep he just couldn&#39;t<br/>\nlie still...and so on.  A soft tone of voice and lots of repetition may send<br/>\nhim off to dreamland.  Another thing that I find helpful, although some feel<br/>\nthis is &quot;winding them up&quot; is physical exertion.  Have a pillow fight or a<br/>\nsoft ball fight - if I get him giggling then he is relaxed.  He rests<br/>\nnaturally which can then turn into quiet time which may turn into sleep.  I<br/>\nhave also seen my son blow through a nap even though really tired and just<br/>\nend up going to bed really early that night - the key there is to try to<br/>\narrange the quiet time to at least re-charge his batteries.  If nothing is<br/>\nworking in terms of getting my son some quiet time and his behavior is<br/>\ngetting disruptive then often going outside works wonders getting through<br/>\nthe tough hour or two and on to the evening when he falls asleep early.  I<br/>\ndo not feel that doing these things equals &quot;letting my kids run all over me&quot;<br/>\nat all.  We are partners trying to get through the day together as best we<br/>\ncan.

My kids are Echo (3.5) and Kobe (1).  I am hip to AP and I consider myself tolerant, gentle and non violent.  I have never hit my kids and though I have been a yeller in the past since having my 2nd child, I&#39;ve become more APish and I&#39;ve seen the error of my ways and I rarely yell or belittle.  <br/>\nI say I&#39;ve never hit my kids  BUT yesterday was a hell of a day and I lost patience with Echo.  He is never bratty, he never pushes our limits and honestly he rarely needs to be punished - he doesn&#39;t do anything wrong.  He is thoughtful, know our rules and sticks to them with little trouble (their pretty simple).<br/>\nEven yesterday, he didn&#39;t do anything &quot;wrong.&quot;  Please let me tell you what happened and hopefully someone here can give me some insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt nap time, Echo played and goofed around in bed without going to sleep...he was very tired as we were up LATE for the 4th and woke at 5 AM during a camp out.  Our schedule was all off and he was showing all the signs of a tired boy who needs a nap.  I do not MAKE him take a nap, I can see that he is growing out of it, but on days when he starts acting tired and grouchy, we lie down together to rest, yesterday was one of those days.  We were trying to sleep for about 45 min and my husband dropped in for lunch (surprise) so we got up to hang out with him.  I told Echo we would forget about the nap but if was acting crabby or getting in trouble later we would go ahead and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 hours later, Echo got in trouble for hitting his sister with a push toy.  I said &quot;Echo give me that&quot; 3 times and he ignored all 3.  I wanted him to give me the weapon and come and talk about playing nicely, instead he ran away from me.  I calmed his sister, and talked to him and then we were to try again on the nap.  We were talking about how important it is to listen to your mom and trust that she has your best interests in mind<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he acts so bratty (it is rare), I just assume he needs rest, he only does that when he&#39;s tired.  I feel it&#39;s my job to help him get his rest.  I tried to lie down with him for 15 min or so, still awake talking to himself etc.  I had to take care of Kobe so I had him lay down by himself.  I said get your rest and please don&#39;t get up, it&#39;s nap time.  Long story long...he kept getting up - to the point that he was just trying to be defiant.  He would get up after 1 minute - we went thru the same thing SEVERAL times for about an hour and a half.  <br/>\nWe ended with me saying &quot;Echo, if you get up again, you will be in more trouble than ever&quot; he got up again, I put the baby down, went to talk to him and he was acting silly, not listening to me and just flat not taking me seriously.  To get his attention...no excuse, I swatted his leg.  He was so shocked, I hated to see the look on his face and I hated the way it felt to dominate him like that.  The swat, could not have hurt him physically, I barely touched him.  Not that it&#39;s any better but I made sure to not &quot;hit&quot; him, it was a quick attention getting swat, not a spanking at all.  Considering the shorts he was wearing I doubt it hurt at all - but it hurt his pride and I know that I crossed a line.  I have not stopped thinking about yesterday&#39;s events and I&#39;m wondering what I could have done different.  Also, FYI - afterwards we talked, I apologized, left the room and he went right to sleep.  If I didn&#39;t know better, I would say &quot;hey violence gets results.&quot;  It sure did but I know I was wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already promised that it would never happen again, he told me that he knows he was acting like a bad kid yesterday.  Moving forward - I don&#39;t want the kids to run all over me (that&#39;s what happened yesterday, my words, meant nothing).  I also don&#39;t want to yell, scream, scare or just let them have his way because it&#39;s easiest...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no energy for any negative comments or feedback.  I can assure anyone interested in calling CPS that this will never happen again - but now what?   Thanks for reading and sharing.<br/>\nGeneva <br/>\n      Yahoo!
