This gets a laugh  <br/>\nand then the game continues with more and more demanding of ridiculous  <br/>\nthings.  The next thing you know, a potentially parent vs. child moment has  become <br/>\na bonding time.  And they get the point.  Humor is almost  always great and in <br/>\nour house, the sillier the better!<br/>\n <br/>\nOr I&#39;ll ignore it.  Or I might ask in a bit if something is  wrong.  Or <br/>\nsometimes I&#39;ll say what you say.  Or I&#39;ll rephrase in a  more pleasant tone.<br/>\n <br/>\nI think for the most part, telling a child to not be rude (no matter how  <br/>\nnicely phrased) won&#39;t teach a child to not be rude.  It might help a child  <br/>\nrecognize that she is using a rude tone, even grown-ups don&#39;t always realize  that, <br/>\nbut no one wants to hear it every single time!  You can let some pass  you <br/>\nby!  And you are showing your children that they don&#39;t have to be  reactive <br/>\nevery time someone is rude to them.  How many times have you seen  people that <br/>\njust don&#39;t let things go?  You can choose to not react without  being a door mat!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMy oldest with learning and language difficulties just didn&#39;t  understand me <br/>\nwhen I was trying to teach him things like manners.  I  decided to really just <br/>\nlive by example, and mostly NOT react at all when he was  rude.  I really <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have much of a choice.  He is now nine, and  although not always the <br/>\nnicest at home, other people are always commenting to me  how polite he is and that <br/>\nI&#39;m so lucky!
