Which is pretty much  <br/>\nany parent &lt;g&gt;. A couple of years ago, I was confronted by a police  <br/>\nofficer who thought I was endangering Eric, then two. A social worker  <br/>\nfrom CPS followed up with a visit a week or so later (supposed to be  <br/>\nwithin 72 hours but I guess they&#39;re overworked). Her judgment was  <br/>\nthat there was no neglect. But the delay between my confrontation  <br/>\nwith the cop and the visit with the social worker gave me time to get  <br/>\ninformation about the laws and from other parents who&#39;d faced this  <br/>\nkind of thing (I love the WWW).<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have handled my conversation with the cop better, but by the  <br/>\ntime the SW showed up I knew, for instance, that I was not legally  <br/>\nobligated to let her into my house, and that most parents who&#39;ve been  <br/>\nthrough it recommend you don&#39;t let them in. Supposedly they aren&#39;t  <br/>\nsupposed to hold normal household mess against you, but people tell  <br/>\nstories of seeing notes about their dirty dishes or floor that needs  <br/>\nsweeping in their files. So when the social worker arrived, I wrapped  <br/>\nEric in a blanket, stepped out onto the porch, and closed my front  <br/>\ndoor behind me. We had our whole interview on the porch. She did ask  <br/>\nmy why I didn&#39;t let her in; I said, &quot;I don&#39;t like strangers in my  <br/>\nhouse.&quot; And that was that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem paranoid, but I found the website of the Just Cause Law  <br/>\nCollective very useful. It&#39;s aimed at people who might be approached  <br/>\nby police in a criminal matter, but I could have used the advice  <br/>\nsince my first contact in this situation was with a police officer:  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lawcollective.org/\">http://www.lawcollective.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI was so agitated by the cop confronting me that in the three minutes  <br/>\nI talked to her, I said two things that weren&#39;t true! Not meaning to  <br/>\nlie, just agitated. And they both came up in the interview with the  <br/>\nSW. It was very uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy not knowing ahead of time how to handle being questioned by a cop,  <br/>\nI did myself harm. But I won&#39;t make that mistake again, and I tend to  <br/>\nproselytize to other parents when I have the chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I found out in my research is that CPS can talk to kids at  <br/>\nschool without their parents being informed or consenting. Paranoid  <br/>\nagain, I know, but I call that reason number 10,263 to homeschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":92643757,"authorName":"Leslie530@aol.com","from":"Leslie530@...","profile":"lescather","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [unschoolingbasics] Re: same sex sharing a room....","postDate":"1145028784","msgId":11891,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMxMC4yZjE5YWQyLjMxNzExYWIwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":11889,"nextInTopic":11892,"prevInTime":11890,"nextInTime":11892,"topicId":11859,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well, I don t know the law, but supposedly in SC they will not rent a two bedroom apt. to people with opposite sex children.
