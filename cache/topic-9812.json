Drinking too much water can mess you up real bad, going without sleep for extended periods can cause psychosis; however, there are many nutritionists that would disagree that sugar causes only small changes in blood sugar.  It does if eaten with other more &quot;stabilizing&quot; foods, but many people who eat large amounts of carbohydrates (which turn to sugar in the blood stream)without combining them with proteins or fats will have blood sugar drops throughout the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think sugar is a necessary food (not as necessary as my children do, but hey..).  It tastes good.  Without it in our blood, we wouldn&#39;t function.  However, it does work best in our bodies when combined with other foods.  I think we do well to help our kids understand how that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a swimming pool with a deep end in our backyard.  We think it is necessary &lt;grin&gt; living here in Texas.  Everyone has fun and enjoys it as much as possible but the kids learned about how to enjoy it without causing damage to themselves.
