Talked about it being cold getting out of the shower and discussed turning up the heat for a bit, asking me to bring a hot towel out of the dryer when possible, and the warmest times to shower. Weve talked about body odor and enjoying being close to people when they smell good....along with the general health reasons . <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Just the past couple weeks she has been showering or taking a bath at least every other day without any mention from me . Today all 3 kids played at the park and the 2 younger asked for a bath about 7. She came and told me that she had wiped off with a wet washcloth and needed to write a letter to aunt angie on her new horse paper so she would shower in the morning. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I didnt remove limits and then have this perfectly clean kid ( does it ever happen that way lol? ) with fantastic personal hygeine habbits 2 weeks later.

My  <br/>\nhusband and I say &quot;Thank you&quot; a lot to each other and to the kids, its  <br/>\na habit, and they&#39;ve developed the habit, too.

When a parent forces a child to do dishes, for example, a  <br/>\nchild can be doing them every night, but, far from developing a habit  <br/>\nof keeping the dishes done, he can be constantly thinking, &quot;I HATE  <br/>\ndoing dishes.&quot; As soon as he is released from the parents&#39; control, he  <br/>\nmay never do dishes again if he can find any way out of it. Or, he may  <br/>\nfeel horribly guilty every time there is a dirty dish in the sink and  <br/>\nbecome anxious and obsessive about dishes. That&#39;s not a good habit,  <br/>\neither.<br/>\n<br/>\nGentle support in developing good habits is nice. Make brushing teeth  <br/>\nevery night a calm and happy part of the evening, if you can.

Yeah, <br/>\nthere are some - there are habits (of doing or thinking) that can be <br/>\ndamaging as there are habits (of doing or thinking) that can be <br/>\npositive. But, it&#39;s not quite as black and white as it might seem. <br/>\nAnd, most of the &quot;good&quot; habits are things that can develop without <br/>\nbeing pushed because they are positive/helpful/etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a personal anecdotal level, my almost 10 yr old has taken to <br/>\nshowering about once a week. We&#39;ve never required bathing really. In <br/>\nthe summer, when his feet are generally really grubby by settling in <br/>\ntime, I&#39;d get a washcloth and wash his feet. And there have been <br/>\ntimes he&#39;s bathed/showered multiple times per day just to play in the <br/>\nwater. His current situation is that he&#39;s started to notice that if <br/>\nhe&#39;s gone for several days without showering, he starts to get a <br/>\nlittle &#39;funky&#39; in his underarms (he&#39;ll wake up, sniff his armpits and <br/>\nsay &quot;I&#39;m stinky, I need to shower&quot; and off he goes). He&#39;s also been <br/>\nresistant to hair washing, so we would ask if he wanted it or no - <br/>\noften it was no and that was that. But, more recently, he&#39;s made a <br/>\nconnection between the way his scalp feels and hair/scalp washing. <br/>\nSo, as usual, if he&#39;s showering/bathing, I&#39;ll ask if he wants me to <br/>\nwash his hair. More often now he&#39;s saying yes. And we&#39;ve worked out a <br/>\nsystem/procedure that he is comfortable with - I get a dry washcloth <br/>\nthat he can hold over his face (he doesn&#39;t like water in his face, <br/>\ntakes after me - I keep a towel over the shower rod so I can dry my <br/>\nface immediately after washing it and any time water splashes in it <br/>\nwhile I shower). Then I use the hand held sprayer (we have a dual <br/>\nhead shower which is wonderful, not expensive, easy to install) to <br/>\nspray his head, get a small amount of shampoo and lather it in my <br/>\nhands first then rub his head and rinse again with the sprayer. Then <br/>\nwe dab his face dry and he&#39;s on his own for the rest of the shower <br/>\n(however long he wants that to be). <br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, if he hasn&#39;t brushed his teeth for a few days, he (or I or <br/>\nDH) might notice his breath is &quot;Hot&quot; (his term for it) or &quot;Stinky&quot; <br/>\nand off we&#39;ll go to brush (he still wants assistance when he <br/>\nbrushes). He&#39;s got a couple of brushes to choose from and a <br/>\ntoothpaste he chose (nothing minty - too strong for him). <br/>\n<br/>\n--Deb</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232521827,"authorName":"organicsis","from":"organicsis &lt;organicsis@...&gt;","profile":"organicsis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Forming Habits?","postDate":"1203663440","msgId":30169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcwMDk4Ny42ODIzNy5xbUB3ZWI1MTMwMy5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30171,"prevInTime":30168,"nextInTime":30170,"topicId":30169,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I was discussing this with my mom awhile back and have since mulled it over and over in my head.

I&#39;d like to get some unschooling opinion on the matter to contrast what I&#39;ve heard so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were discussing unschooling and freedom to choose and learning through experience instead of forcefully trying to teach someone something. She understands and supports what we do but made a point that has been popping into my mind on occasion. She said that it is still important to help your child to form good habits and help them see when bad habits might be forming. She was talking mainly in terms of health matters such as brushing your teeth or showering and she was referring to younger kids (under 5) mostly but to all people really. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are all your thoughts on this subject? Do you believe unschoolers can (or generally do not) form bad habits or do you think it&#39;s important to help little ones form good habits?
