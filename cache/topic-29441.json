Generally we only go *into* stores to <br/>\nBUY things (I&#39;m NOT a window shopper, so if *I* go in, I *will* buy <br/>\nsomething!).<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t lie. I would say, &quot;I only have four dollars. Toilet paper costs <br/>\n$3.78. With tax, I may have to scrape the bottom of my purse for the <br/>\ntotal. Today, all we can afford is what&#39;s on the list. And the list <br/>\ntoday is really, really short!&quot; I used to say that a LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my boys went through this stage of <br/>\nI-want-everything-and-I-want-it-now. I think it&#39;s really, really normal <br/>\n from about three to nine or ten. Duncan, at almost 12, seems to have <br/>\ngrasped the concept sometime in the last two years. But before they <br/>\nunderstood, I would always bring home a candy bar from the grocery---or <br/>\nlet them pick something out at the check out almost every time. It <br/>\nwasn&#39;t always possible. Sometimes I really had only four dollars to my <br/>\nname. Because they almost *always* got something, they understood when <br/>\nI really *couldn&#39;t* afford something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one time Cameron wanted something, and there was no $$. I <br/>\ntold him that I had no money right now. He suggested that I simply <br/>\nwrite a check! &lt;G&gt; Duncan&#39;s taken a similar line: &quot;Can&#39;t you use your <br/>\ndebit card?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of &quot;no money&quot; just isn&#39;t real for them. &quot;Budget&quot; is a hard <br/>\nconcept too. Just because there&#39;s $500 in the bank today doesn&#39;t mean <br/>\nthat I can afford a PS2 *today*---that $500 has to cover groceries and <br/>\ngas and the Charleston trip and....<br/>\n<br/>\nAs they&#39;ve gotten older, it&#39;s really gotten easier. And they know I get <br/>\nmost of my $$ at the beginning of each month. So by the end of the <br/>\nmonth, money&#39;s getting tight. We tend to *do* and buy more things at <br/>\nthe beginning of the month! &lt;G&gt; Now Dunc will ask what day of the month <br/>\nit is before he asks for something, &#39;cause he knows that the <br/>\npossibility is lower at the end of the month---unless I have a lot of <br/>\ndogs scheduled.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway---We&#39;re taking issue with the lying. They will grow to <br/>\nunderstand when you can afford it and when you can&#39;t.

I<br/>\nthink that is what people were trying, in various ways, to get at: the<br/>\noriginal post was a big either/or no other options BUT there were lots<br/>\nof options. And, you sat down with them and figured out how to get what<br/>\nthey want without doing damage to yourself or going without absolute<br/>\nnecessities. THAT is exactly what it&#39;s about - working together to reach<br/>\ngoals mutually. And, once this way of doing things becomes habit, it can<br/>\nbe quite amazing. About a month ago, we went out looking for a Wii (did<br/>\nI mention this already?) - not to be found anywhere even though we DID<br/>\nhave the money already collected up. DS was sad (so were we) and we all<br/>\ncommiserated about what a bummer it was at the SAME time we were looking<br/>\nfor alternatives (check online, check the Nintendo Wii-finder site,<br/>\netc). Nowhere for Wiis - not even on Canadian websites - except a few<br/>\nplaces on eBay that were asking several hundred dollars more than it<br/>\nretails for (and which we didn&#39;t have saved up). We decided to wait and<br/>\nkeep checking and keep saving. A few weeks later, a little saving and<br/>\nextra refiguring and noting that the 40 gig PS3 was not much more<br/>\nexpensive than the Wii (the top of the line one is about double the<br/>\nprice though and that&#39;s where we had been aiming). The only difference<br/>\nis that the low end one doesn&#39;t play PS2 games. We discussed it and<br/>\ndecided that since the PS2 we have is still in fine shape, we don&#39;t need<br/>\nthat ability necessarily so Go For It! The Wii is still on our List but<br/>\nit&#39;s not at the top right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, also, it might help to actually have a written &quot;Stuff we&#39;d like to<br/>\nget/do/try&quot; list - write it down, research estimated cost (the canning<br/>\nsupplies we want to get will cost about $60, the hot sauce DH likes that<br/>\nis only available by ordering it from St. Croix costs $10 per bottle<br/>\nplus $7.50 shipping, the Northeast Unschooling Conference will cost this<br/>\nmuch, a weekend trip to here or there will cost about this much, etc) We<br/>\nstarted doing this when DS was really young - as long as it was written<br/>\ndown, he could relax and know that it&#39;d happen and wouldn&#39;t get<br/>\nforgotten (because he already trusted that we would do what we said we<br/>\nwould do).<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**********************************************************************<br/>\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and<br/>\nintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they<br/>\nare addressed.

It&#39;s so interesting that in this process with our children, I am also making much sense of my own childhood and the effects it has on me.  I&#39;ve done so much work already on this, but this is a new context.  I have food issues, never really feel full, always trying to fill the &quot;vague void&quot;.  SO much fodder for growth for our family...Ryan (dh) along with us too if it&#39;s what he chooses, and I hope he does.  Unschooling really does require looking at everything through a new lense, doesn&#39;t it?!?

They take a very big old tire from our Jeep and stand it up behind the ramp and try to jump over it. Then my ds starts talking to me about how he&#39;d love to teach a class at the community college about the physics of skateboarding. So cool!<br/>\n   <br/>\n  All just my opinions, though.

Would you be able to share what made the difference?  What changed?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I picked up the book &quot;The Verbally Abusive Relationship&quot; at the library after it was suggested by someone in this group, and it&#39;s rather discouraging how much of it fits for Ryan and I right now.

I don&#39;t have an issue at all with airing this in front of the group, since I would suspect that there is the odd other couple out there who has had a rocky time &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thanks,<br/>\n  Jodi  <br/>\n                         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?

We&#39;ve<br/>\nhit on tough times financially lately as bills have gone up but not the<br/>\npaycheck(yet) and I&#39;ve had to tell my three year old that we can&#39;t buy<br/>\nthings every time we enter a store and he is taking this very hard.  Luckily<br/>\nthe girls are older and are more understanding(they are 8 and almost 12).<br/>\nIt gets really tiresome telling Jackson no again and again and listening to<br/>\nhim throw fit after fit about it though.  Sometimes what he wants is little<br/>\neven but if I can&#39;t buy a little something for everyone then I don&#39;t buy for<br/>\none or myself.   I would wait it out personally and let them know that you<br/>\nwant to be able to give it to them but that they  have to wait a little<br/>\nwhile maybe you can squeeze a little somewhere over the next few months.

That&#39;s one of the reasons why it&#39;s so <br/>\nimportant for us to work on resentments and other icky feelings we <br/>\nmay be holding.  It works in the other direction, too.  Feeling <br/>\njoyful and lighthearted is just as contagious as feeling resentful <br/>\nand dejected and toxic!  (Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re <br/>\nfeeling resentful, dejected and toxic; I can only go by the Karen you <br/>\npresent in your emails, and that&#39;s who I&#39;m responding to; if what I&#39;m <br/>\nsaying doesn&#39;t fit, just, you know, blow me off!)  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that these joyful feelings should be forced, mind you, but you <br/>\ncan begin to get there just by feeling true gratitude for the things <br/>\n(and not just material things but, you know, the many blessings) you <br/>\nhave in your life.  It&#39;s a great practice to get into with your kids, <br/>\nwho may really want to join you on their own.  Even if they don&#39;t, <br/>\nthey will likely benefit, as will you, from the joy you begin to feel <br/>\nfrom this practice.
